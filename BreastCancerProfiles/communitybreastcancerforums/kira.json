      "Content": "kira wrote: I know I've been on a tear about this, but this lymphconnect.com site http://lymphconnect.com/ has really gotten to me: and on further review, the Avon White Paper had as one of the authors, Steven Schonholz, medical director of impedimed, who has only one publication to his name on LE--a letter to the editor of Cancer on how he uses bioimpedance--which was shot down by Nicole Stout. So, they write this Avon White paper, and promote bioimpedance as a way to catch LE early, when the symptoms could possibly be reversed. That's awfully close to acting like they could \"cure\" LE. Then, they start this site, with some decent information, but it all comes back to bioimpedance, and promoting the L-dex: which states \"is not intended to diagnose LE\" and they solicit personal stories of LE from patients to post on their site and facebook. Here is Dr. Schonholz's one publication--other than the Avon White Paper, which was also written by Stanley Rockson of Stanford and Nancy Hutchinson of Minnesota: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...   In Cancer, Stout Gergich et al1 demonstrated the successful treatment of lymphedema in breast cancer patients who were presurgically base-lined and postoperatively monitored for subclinical lymphedema. The data support prospective assessment and periodic surveillance. There were 2 limitations. First, the lack of a randomized-control design allowing some patients to have lymphedema progression. Second, the optoelectrical device is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared and may not be practical. A randomized control study is ethically difficult. It would have allowed extracellular fluid to accumulate and put these patients at risk of permanent damage to their lymphatic systems. In 2007, the FDA cleared a device for clinical assessment and monitoring of lymphedema. The technology uses a low-frequency bioelectrical current that passes through the extracellular space of the patient's limb. The device compares the patient's at-risk limb and her contralateral uninvolved limb. The result of that ratio is the Lymphedema Index score. An abnormal score can identify subclinical lymphedema up to 10 months before clinical presentation. At the Breast Care Center at Mercy Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, all breast cancer patients are evaluated preoperatively using the Lymphedema Index. Repeat measurements are obtained on the first visit postoperatively, before initiation of radiation, and with completion. They have repeat evaluation every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter. If chemotherapy is involved, measurements are obtained before, monthly throughout the course, and when completed. The patients having mastectomy also have a physical therapy consult for teaching and postoperative management for the first 1-2 weeks. With this new technology not only will we be able to identify subclinical lymphedema, but we will be able to prevent the chronic sequelae of the disease process, and may be able to identify the risk factors associated with lymphedema. Reference 1 Stout Gergich NL,Pfalzer LA,McGarvey C,Springer B,Gerber LH,Soballe P. Preoperative assessment enables the early detection and successful treatment of lymphedema. Cancer. 2008; 112: 2809-2819. Steven M. Schonholz MD*, * Mercy Medical Center, 271 Carew Street, Springfield, MA 01102.   And Nicole Stout replies: Our study \"Preoperative Assessment Enables the Early Detection and Successful Treatment of Lymphedema\" used infrared technology to measure limb volume for screening and diagnosis of lymphedema.1 The Perometer device is used routinely in research related to lymphedema diagnosis and management. Limb volume change over time can be tracked with a high degree of accuracy using the Perometer. Many trials have been conducted to qualify it as a sensitive, reliable tool.2 Our study was the first to use this measurement tool in a prospective manner to diagnose subclinical swelling. We defined subclinical lymphedema as >3% change in limb volume as compared to the baseline, preoperative limb volume with consideration for the contralateral limb. The Perometer device is sensitive enough to capture this slight change in limb volume, although it occurs before clinical signs of swelling are apparent. Because the Perometer is not an invasive device, there is no requirement for the FDA to approve it. The multifrequency bioimpedance unit is a new measurement technology that is valid to measure clinically apparent lymphedema and to quantify change over time.3, 4 Prospective studies using the bioimpedance unit, however, have not been conducted to demonstrate its efficacy in detecting limb volume changes consistent with subclinical lymphedema at the threshold that we have demonstrated can be captured with the Perometer (3%). Box et al conducted a prospective surveillance program and found that the multifrequency bioimpedance unit was not sensitive enough to capture 50% of the patients in her cohort who developed lymphedema.5 They concluded that the device was not sensitive enough to detect the earliest clinical changes in the limb. This could be associated with several limitations of the device, including; the loss of sensitivity the device has when the patient is in an altered state of hydration, has not voided their bladder before measurement, or has not lain supine for 10 minutes before measurement. Each of these confounding factors may have precluded the device from being able to capture limb volume change at such a sensitive threshold of 3%. Based on our study, the Perometer was effectively able to detect a minimum 3% limb volume change when a preoperative measurement was taken and patients were monitored at regular intervals overtime. This enabled early diagnosis and treatment of lymphedema. Further research should be conducted using the Perometer and the multi-frequency bioimpedance unit not only for concurrent validity in monitoring volume change over time, but to study the sensitivity of the measurement device for early detection.

I actually spoke to Steven Schonholz and he told me that he thought they no longer made perometers..... I very much want lymphedema to have a valid, objective, reproducible method of diagnosis, and I firmly believe that early diagnosis is important. But, I also feel we deserve to know when our personal, private medical histories are being used to market a device that essentially has not been proven to be sensitive or accurate and is expensive ($40 a measurement, currently) And I resent when a position paper that is co-written by leading researchers in lymphedema is also essentially promoting a device. If the Avon White Paper had been in a peer reviewed journal, the writers would have had to reveal financial conflicts of interest. As an independent position paper, they didn't, and yet--to my reading--there are conflicts of interest present here. I really, really resent a website that appears to promote LE information and solidarity and solicits private information from us, and it's really a marketing device.

Early detection and intervention methods for BC patients at risk for lymphedema should be developed analogous to the model used in screening mammography. Similar to the rationale for mammography, a surveillance model of early detection and early intervention (at early stages) in BCRL can prevent progression. Currently there are no clinical guidelines for early intervention of LE and these procedures are often not reimbursed by managed care providers. However, the Avon Foundation for Women Breast Cancer Crusade and other nonprofit foundations make funds available to hospitals to enable at-risk BCRL patients to access these new technologies with the anticipation that managed care providers will soon provide coverage. Is that marketing? Are the researchers who are accepting funds from impedimed truly impartial? Unfortunately, the new Stanford LE registry contains identical language. These are the national LE experts and the national LE advocacy groups. I sent emails to the authors of the White Paper expressing my concerns about this, and especially the fake patient lymphconnect.com website, and heard from the Lymphatic Research Foundation that they are passing along my concerns. I don't know why I'm so shocked at this behavior: I've witnessed medical researchers receiving large sums of money from drug companies, while releasing dubious data, it's just that I care so much about LE treatment and research, I can't stand to see it sullied, and to feel misled. I have a dog in this hunt. Kira",

Focus on 1-3 Positive Nodes June 4, 2011 (Chicago, Illinois) - Women with early breast cancer and as few as 1 to 3 positive nodes should be offered radiation treatment to their regional lymph nodes, in addition to standard whole-breast radiation (WBI), according to a study presented here at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2011 Annual Meeting. In a phase 3 clinical trial of women with either node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer, regional nodal irradiation (RNI) significantly improved disease-free survival at 5 years (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; P = .003), said lead author Timothy J. Whelan, BM, BCh, from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. This constituted a 33% improvement in disease-free survival in the group receiving WBI plus RNI, compared with the group receiving the WBI alone. This is a \"potentially practice-changing\" clinical trial, Dr. Whelan told Medscape Medical News at an ASCO press conference where the study was highlighted. However, these are interim, 5-year results, said Dr. Whelan. The study's primary outcome of overall survival has not yet seen a statistically significant improvement, but there is a trend present, he said. Overall mortality was reduced by 24% in the group receiving WBI plus RNI, compared with WBI alone group (HR, 0.76; 5-year risk, 7.7% and 9.3%, respectively; P = .07). Dr. Whelan presented the results on behalf of the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group and American and Australian clinical trials groups, all of which conducted the study, known as MA.20. Notably, 85% of the 1832 study participants had 1 to 3 positive nodes; the benefit of adding RNI in such women has been unclear, he said. At the press conference, Dr. Whelan explained that, in general, women with node-positive breast cancer are treated with breast-conserving surgery plus axillary lymph node dissection, followed by WBI. However, if a woman's cancer has high-risk features, such as a tumor larger than 5 cm or more than 3 positive axillary nodes, she often also receives RNI, which is defined as radiation to the internal mammary, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes; this is the course of treatment recommended in the ASCO guidelines. Women with 1 to 3 positive nodes have constituted a gray zone of uncertainty and have been in need of further study, Dr. Whelan summarized. Practice Changing: 2 Votes Some clinicians have already adopted RNI as part of their standard of care for all node-positive women, including those with 1 to 3 positive nodes. \"As an institutional policy, we have routinely done RNI in these patients for some years,\" said David E. Wazer, MD, from Rhode Island Hospital and Brown University in Providence. Dr. Wazer told Medscape Medical News that all node-positive women should receive RNI and that the study should be practice changing. Another radiation oncologist called the study \"intriguing,\" but suggested that clinicians make RNI decisions in patients with 1 to 3 positive nodes on a case-by-case basis. \"This has been an area of controversy, with data to both support and not support the addition of regional nodal radiation in this subset of patients,\" Sandy Anderson, MD, from Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia Pennsylvania, told Medscape Medical News. The MA.20 data are important, said Dr. Anderson, in the context of another study of women with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes, the Z0011 trial from the American College of Surgeons, which was presented last year at the ASCO annual meeting. That study found that \"whole-breast radiation is adequate treatment after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy\" in women with 1 to 3 positive nodes, and was not inferior to completion axillary dissection, said Dr. Anderson. Just how much treatment a patient with 1 to 3 positive nodes needs is a complex calculation, according to Dr. Anderson. \"Clinicians need to weigh the toxicity of regional nodal radiation against the toxicity of further axillary dissection, along with the clinical and pathologic factors for each individual patient,\" she said. Findings The women in the MA.20 study, who averaged 53 years in age, had all been treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant systemic therapy - either chemotherapy (91%) or endocrine therapy (71%). As noted above, most had 1 to 3 positive nodes, but a small proportion of the women had either more than 4 positive nodes (5%) or high-risk node-negative breast cancer (10%). The study design randomized the women to receive either WBI alone (n = 916) or WBI plus RNI (n = 916). The WBI consisted of 50 Gy in 25 fractions plus boost irradiation. The RNI consisted of 45 Gy in 25 fractions. There is now a median follow-up of 62 months. Dr. Whelan explained that the study had a protocol-specified interim analysis of relapse patterns, survival, and toxicity at 5 years. After review of the data, the Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommended the release of the results. In addition to the overall disease-free survival benefit, there were other statistically significant benefits for the group receiving the RNI therapy, said Dr. Whelan. WBI plus RNI, compared with WBI alone, was associated with a statistically significant 42% improvement in isolated locoregional disease-free survival (HR, 0.58; 5-year risk, 3.2% and 5.5%, respectively; P = .02), and a 36% improvement in distant disease-free survival (HR, 0.64; 5-year risk, 7.6% and 13.0%, respectively; P = .002). On the downside of the data, WBI plus RNI, compared with WBI alone, was associated with a statistically significant increase in dermatitis (50% and 40%, respectively; P < .001), grade 2 or greater pneumonitis (1.3% and 0.2%, respectively; P = .01), and lymphedema (7.3% and 4.1%, respectively; P = .004). The rate of lymphedema with RNI seems low, said Dr. Wazer. \"Community experience may see a higher rate,\" he added.",

I'm going to hope that some of the women who have truncal swelling and have used swell spots will help answer your question about getting relief from your post op pain and swelling--it's a hard area to compress, but Binney often recommends a leotard or a sport shirt turned inside out (so seams don't rub). On this board, women post who never wear sleeves and never get lymphedema--and the statistics are in your favor. But why not lower your risk?  Here's the NLN (National Lymphedema Network) position paper on risk reduction http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnriskreduction.pdf  I wonder if brief periods of icing would help your post-op swelling?

I did show a similar chafe to my onc, and she had me take antibiotics for it--she said a cellulitis could develop so rapidly, it made sense to treat.   It's always easy to second guess ourselves, but my LE therapist tells a story of a woman who got a poke from a wicker basket, and they didn't treat her in the ER, and she ended up with a terrible cellulitis. Only if we could see the future would we know if this is \"just a chafe\" or an early infection.   IMO, the fact that it is still red with any movement means you did the right thing.   Binney and I have discussed length of treatment: an established cellulitis should be treated until clear, or the standard 7-10 days. My LE therapist who worked with an LE doctor in NYC has a rule of three days for suspected early cellulitis or a provocation--a break in the skin, an aspiration of seroma, etc. Too short a course can promote resistance, but with cellulitis: \"what you see is what you get\"--it's an obvious infection.   Warm, redness, pain, flu like symptoms, fever are all signs of cellulitis, but early on, it's usually just the red rash.   It's a tough call, but I think you made the prudent and correct choice.

Linda, your observation of the power of the placebo effect is so astute. In psychiatric studies, it approaces 40% response, just getting some TLC. There was a great article in the local medical society journal by an excellent neurologist about a patient he had with treatment resistant depression--they were out of options--and he entered a study and went into remission. And then the study ended and he relapsed. And the patient was in the placebo arm. Part of what I struggle with with LE is abandonment: my physicians could care less about my LE, and my LE therapists are great, but I had to kiss a lot of frogs before I found a decent team (I emailed Binney constantly), and yet I still feel the need to turn to this site for support and knowledge. So, just being in a study was very powerful and the authors agreed that the symptom reduction may have been biased. Duh. I need to re-read the initial anaysis of the study, it was in Current  Clinical Trials about 6 months ago, there were 295 women in it--and I'm wondering why the study as published only treated the women with LE (who if you read it carefully ,were about 5 or more years out from bc dx--only a few on hormone therapy, and had to be rock solid stable to even be enrolled. Not represenative of the vast majority of women with LE. As Jane wrote, about 3000 women were screened, and 141 were enrolled, of which 71 received the treatment.) What happened to the other 29000 women? Kira",

Here are some suggestions on what to do while waiting--on the web page there's a link on how to find a qualified therapist: www.stepup-speakout.org/How_Yo... What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential.   1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled.

It is the results of the PAL's study fromn U Penn, where about 300 women, half with LE were enrolled in in a YMCA training program with specially trained instructors. Notice the outcomes: uring the course of the study, women in the weightlifting group experienced fewer exacerbations of their condition, and a reduction in symptoms compared to the women who did not lift weights. There were 19 women in the control group who experienced lymphedema exacerbations that required treatment from a physical therapist, compared to 9 in the treatment group. The proportion of women who experienced an increase of five percent or more in their limb swelling was similar in both groups -- 11 percent of the weight-lifting group and 12 percent in the control group. The researchers theorize that a controlled weightlifting program may have protective benefits, by boosting strength in affected limbs enough to ward off injuries from everyday activities that can aggravate lymphedema symptoms. 1) No real change in swelling between the two, small groups 2) More flares, yet it's not clear if it's stastically significant 3) Less \"symptoms\"--but until the formal article, we don't know what that consists of 4) It sure didn't cure anyone or stop disease progression  This group has long had a bias that women should be weight lifting, they work with a PT: \"Dr\". Linda T Miller (has a bachelor's degree and gives weekend courses to PT's but won't be LANA certified, and it's unclear how she can call herself doctor) who wants all women with LE to weight lift. I've dealt with two of her \"graduates\" and they were not well trained--IMO--hard to be with only 2 days of training. One thought that MLD was to smear me with cream and push hard. Yet,Binney knows a Linda T Miller grad who has educated herself beyond her initial training is a good therapist. I just interviewed a PT at a local hospital, and she was a Linda  T Miller grad, and didn't know what a fitter was... www.breastcancerpt.com/about-l... I think they want us to inprove the quality of our life and with care, try some strengthening, but even in their publication that talked about the preliminary study they had problems with consistency of the trainers. Wimps if we don't do it? I'm afraid that's how the message will go out. I've corresponded with the study author, and she means well. But, clearly has an agenda. Kira ",

I'm not against them. There was a time when I felt like every patient who came to see me got a prescription, but often that was because they had no access to therapy. I've seen anti-depressants do a great job of turning things around for people, so I don't want to come off as anti-medication--I just think that if you have significant reservations, that's legitimate. The therapist wants you to feel better, so she's going to suggest medications, because they can help, but you have every right to keep up with the talk therapy and see how things are going. Full disclosure: I take a small amount of celexa--started for vertigo that was intractable--and I have no idea if it helps my mood, but definitely helps with hot flashes, and the vertigo is so much better.

Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy is one of the most common orthopedic procedures, yet rigorous evidence of its efficacy is lacking. We conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in 146 patients 35 to 65 years of age who had knee symptoms consistent with a degenerative medial meniscus tear and no knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomly assigned to arthroscopic partial meniscectomy or sham surgery. The primary outcomes were changes in the Lysholm and Western Ontario Meniscal Evaluation Tool (WOMET) scores (each ranging from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms) and in knee pain after exercise (rated on a scale from 0 to 10, with 0 denoting no pain) at 12 months after the procedure. In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were no significant between-group differences in the change from baseline to 12 months in any primary outcome. The mean changes (improvements) in the primary outcome measures were as follows: Lysholm score, 21.7 points in the partial-meniscectomy group as compared with 23.3 points in the sham-surgery group (between-group difference, -1.6 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.2 to 4.0); WOMET score, 24.6 and 27.1 points, respectively (between-group difference, -2.5 points; 95% CI, -9.2 to 4.1); and score for knee pain after exercise, 3.1 and 3.3 points, respectively (between-group difference, -0.1; 95% CI, -0.9 to 0.7). There were no significant differences between groups in the number of patients who required subsequent knee surgery (two in the partial-meniscectomy group and five in the sham-surgery group) or serious adverse events (one and zero, respectively). In this trial involving patients without knee osteoarthritis but with symptoms of a degenerative medial meniscus tear, the outcomes after arthroscopic partial meniscectomy were no better than those after a sham surgical procedure.

This study aims to assess potential complications of autologous lymph-node transplantation (ALNT) to treat limb lymphoedema. Prospective, observational study. All limb-lymphoedema patients, followed up in a single lymphology department, who decided to undergo ALNT (January 2004-June 2012) independently of our medical team, were included. Among the 26 patients (22 females, four males) included, 14 had secondary upper-limb lymphoedema after breast-cancer treatment and seven had secondary and five primary lower-limb lymphoedema. Median (interquartile range, IQR) ages at primary lower-limb lymphoedema and secondary lymphoedema onset were 18.5 (13-30) and 47.4 (35-58) years, respectively. Median body mass index (BMI) was 25.9 (22.9-29.3) kg m\u207b². For all patients, median pre-surgery lymphoedema duration was 37 (24-90) months. Thirty-four ALNs were transplanted into the 26 patients, combined with liposuction in four lower-limb-lymphoedema patients. Ten (38%) patients developed 15 complications: six, chronic lymphoedema (four upper limb, two lower limb), defined as ≥2-cm difference versus the contralateral side, in the limb on the donor lymph-node-site territory, persisting for a median of 40 months post-ALNT; four, post-surgical lymphocoeles; one testicular hydrocoele requiring surgery; and four with persistent donor-site pain. Median (IQR) pre- and post-surgical lymphoedema volumes, calculated using the formula for a truncated cone, were, respectively, 1023 (633-1375) ml (median: 3 (1-6) months) and 1058 (666-1506) ml (median: 40 (14-72) months; P = 0.73). ALNT may engender severe, chronic complications, particularly persistent iatrogenic lymphoedema. Further investigations are required to evaluate and clearly determine its indications.

The two categories of surgical intervention that are currently available in the United States are lymphatic reconstruction and excisional surgeries Lymphatic Reconstruction Lymph node transplant is surgery in which lymph nodes are moved from one part of the body (usually the abdomen) to the lymphedema affected area. The transplanted lymph node theoretically stimulates the growth of new lymph channels into and out of the transplanted node. Anastamotic reconstruction attempts to restore lymph flow through a surgical re-joining of the damaged lymph channel either to another lymphatic vessel or to a vein. Debulking is surgery that involves the surgical removal of excess tissue that hangs in folds. Liposuction is an excisional operation during which a tube is inserted under the skin. Through this tube, a high-pressure vacuum is applied to break up and \"suck out\" excess fat cells. This procedure often leaves excess skin hanging loose. Because most of the observations of outcomes from lymphatic reconstruction for lymphedema are limited in scope and duration of follow-up, these procedures are not actively practiced in our institution. A significant potential for risk exists, including unexpected worsening of the lymphedema, failure to improve the original condition, and scarring complications of the surgical intervention. In lymph node transplantation, there is a finite risk that lymphedema could also develop in the region of the body from which the transplanted lymph node is harvested. Excisional Surgeries Debulking is a surgical intervention that removes large excesses of skin and soft tissue overgrowth; which occurs as a complication of longstanding lymphedema Liposuction is a specialized adaptation of the procedure that permits the surgeon to remove overgrown fatty tissue that resides under the skin. This can become necessary in lymphedema because of the tendency for fatty overgrowth to commonly occur when lymphedema is chronic. In properly selected patients, the lymphedema limb can be restored to normal size through surgery. The operation is performed under general anesthesia, but is minimally invasive. The surgical technique has been perfected in Europe over the past two decades and now has an extensive documentation of efficacy without complications or untoward outcomes. Both forms of excisional surgery are performed, for properly selected patients, in our center.

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2009 11:33AM - edited Oct 7, 2009 02:39PM by kira There actually is a study about prophylactic use of compression garments: women were followed with bioimpedance and supplied with over the counter Jobst sleeve and gauntlet and were measured by bioimpedance--at the first sign of any increase they were to wear the sleeve/gauntlet--and the vast majority resolved that early increase in fluid. If they did not--they were sent for traditional treatment. Bioimpedance has a mixed record of under-sensitivity, and Mei Fu PhD has recently abandoned using it in favor of perometry. Also, we don't know if women get congested and would have possible cleared without sleeve/gauntlet--but the study did show benefit at close monitoring and use of the compression garments in post op women. Here's the abstract www3.interscience.wiley.com/jo...  Actually, this trial used volume measurementsBACKGROUND The incidence of breast cancer (BC)-related lymphedema (LE) ranges from 7% to 47%. Successful management of LE relies on early diagnosis using sensitive measurement techniques. In the current study, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of a surveillance program that included preoperative limb volume measurement and interval postoperative follow-up to detect and treat subclinical LE. METHODS LE was identified in 43 of 196 women who participated in a prospective BC morbidity trial. Limb volume was measured preoperatively and at 3-month intervals after surgery. If an increase >3% in upper limb (UL) volume developed compared with the preoperative volume, then a diagnosis of LE was made, and a compression garment intervention was prescribed for 4 weeks. Upon reduction of LE, garment wear was continued only during strenuous activity, with symptoms of heaviness, or with visible swelling. Women returned to the 3-month interval surveillance pathway. Statistical analysis was a repeated-measures analysis of variance by time and limb (P .001) comparing the LE cohort with an age-matched control group. RESULTS The time to onset of LE averaged 6.9 months postoperatively. The mean (±standard deviation) affected limb volume increase was 83 mL (±119 mL; 6.5% ± 9.9%) at LE onset (P = .005) compared with baseline. After the intervention, a statistically significant mean 48 mL (±103 mL; 4.1% ± 8.8%) volume decrease was realized (P < .0001). The mean duration of the intervention was 4.4 weeks (±2.9 weeks). Volume reduction was maintained at an average follow-up of 4.8 months (±4.1 months) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS A short trial of compression garments effectively treated subclinical LE.

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2009 01:57PM - edited Oct 8, 2009 02:10PM by kira Revkat, since I started the thread, it's my title that annoys you--but when she added this paragraph to her analysis of the weight lifting study--I found it irresponsible and not based on any facts. One more thing: Following these findings, I'll also venture to guess that we'll see women start questioning all the rules about lymphedema as they relate to flying, blood pressure cuffs, drawing blood, and more. Stay tuned!  In medicine, there is the concept of \"number needed to treat:--if you initiate a preventive treatment, how many patients do you need to treat to prevent one bad outcome. And usually it's a large number, yet we accept the utility of statin drugs to lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs to avoid strokes--while clearly there are some people with sky high blood pressures who never get strokes and off the roof cholesterols who never get heart attacks. The exception doesn't prove the rule. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_n...  Taking atorvastatin for 3.3 years, therefore, would lead to an ARR of only 1.02% (2.67% minus 1.65%). The number needed to treat to prevent one cardiovascular event would then be 99.7 for 3.3 years.[8][9  So, most of us accept that taking lipitor will prevent heart attacks, yet 99.7 patients need to take it for over three years to prevent one.  And there is also the number needed to harm: The number needed to harm (NNH) is an epidemiological measure that indicates how many patients need to be exposed to a risk-factor to cause harm in one patient that would not otherwise have been harmed. It is defined as the inverse of the attributable risk. Intuitively, the lower the number needed to harm, the worse the risk-factor.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_needed_to_harm I have a great study out of the UK that shows that women who develop LE had poorly functioning lymphatic systems to start with--that's why some women can have a full axillary dissection and run IV's in their arm with no problem, and I can develop LE after 3 nodes out when I got a bug bite. Okay, so we're all different, and you can only make a few generalizations about who will develop LE, the national lymphedema network advises tell women to be careful about their arm when clinical experience has shown that SOME women are susceptible to these actions--only you can't tell which women will react. http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnriskreduction.pdf And they openly admit: Given that there is little evidence-based literature regarding many of these practices, the majority of the recommendations must at this time be based on the knowledge of pathophysiology and decades of clinical experience by experts in the field.  So, IMO, Susan Love extrapolated from the weight lifting study--which had absolutely nothing to do with prevention or cure, but just what some women can do if done carefully--and added this paragraph telling women to throw caution to the wind--because there's no evidence in the medical literature. Sorry if the title of thread annoys you, but her comment annoyed the heck out of me. I'd love to be able to throw caution to the wind, but experience with my LE has shown me that I can't. Kira  By the way, here is the NLN position paper on exercise--it just says do it, and do it carefully--exactly what the NE Journal article said--no mention of a 5 lb limit. www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnex... ",

      "Content": "Oct 9, 2009 01:04PM - edited Oct 9, 2009 01:20PM by kira Shepherd, I remember when the abstract about flying came out of the San Antonio breast conference, and the reason you have to wait for the full article, is that it contains all the details. Otter, in her usual brilliant way, did an analysis of the data, and here is what she wrote: Kira mentioned a study presented at last week's San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) about the risk of LE when flying.  A news release about that study came out in the on-line newsletter, MedPageToday.  The news release was reprinted today in the \"News\" section of bc.org. According to the news release, the study found that women who've had BC surgery \"need not worry\" about developing LE when flying. But, that isn't what the researchers said in their report.  The results they presented in their meeting abstract are different from what the news release says.  Here's a link to a page where you can type in the abstract number (1119) and read the abstract of the study:http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs/sessionindex.php The study involved 75 women who had recovered from BC surgery and were flying to Queensland, Australia, to participate in a dragon boat regatta.   The researchers used \"bioimpedance\" to measure extracellular fluid in the arms of the women before and after the airplane flights. The first problem with the study is that bioimpedance was the only method the researchers used to see if the women had developed LE.  Kira mentioned that some LE researchers think bioimpedance is not sensitive enough to detect LE until it reaches a severe form (Stage III).  So, swelling that was less severe might not have been detected in the study. According to the news release in MedPage Today, 5% of the women in the study did develop a \"clinically significant\" increase in arm fluid.  IMHO, 5% seems like enough of a risk to warrant taking precautions.  What is odd is that the researchers reported a different number in their abstract.  They said 15 of the 75 women developed a \"clinically significant\" increase in arm fluid.  Fifteen of 75 is 20%, not 5%, and a 20% risk is pretty high. But not all the women in the study were at equal risk of developing LE.  Of the 75 women, 12 took fairly short flights to Queensland from other places in Australia.  Only one of those 12 women had a \"clinically significant\" accumulation of arm fluid.  The other 63 women in the study flew all the way from Canada to Australia, which was a much longer flight.  Among those 63 women, 14 had a \"clinically significant\" increase in arm fluid.  So, the women on the longer flights had a 14/63 = 22% chance of developing a \"clinically significant\" increase in arm fluid.  That number really got my attention. Eight of the 15 women who had a \"clinically significant\" increase in arm fluid had enough of an increase for it to be diagnostic of LE (i.e., they did develop LE).  All 8 of those women were on the flights from Canada.  That means 8/63 = 12.7% of the women who took the trans-oceanic flights developed bona fide LE in association with their flights.  The news release says all but 2 of those women had been dx'd with LE previously.  But, the researchers said in their abstract that 6 of the 8 women had not had arm swelling prior to the flight--this was a new dx of LE for them. Finally, the news release and the bc.org \"analysis\" failed to emphasize an important point:  The women in this study were traveling to Australia to participate in a dragon boat regatta.  According to the researchers, 94% of the women in the study had \"trained at a moderate to vigorous intensityfor the regatta.\"   We can probably assume they were in pretty good shape--their upper-body conditioning was likely much better than in most of us.  Several studies have shown that a supervised exercise program involving upper-body strength training can reduce the risk of LE after BC surgery.  Wouldn't that mean the women in this study were at lower risk of developing LE in the first place? The first sentence in the news release says, \"Women who've had breast cancer surgery need not worry that pressure changes in an airplane cabin will bring on lymphedema, researchers found.\" But that's very different from what the researchers concluded.  Here's what they said:   \"For the majority of women who undertake moderate to vigorous upper limb exercise, airplane travel did not have a significant impact on extracellular fluid ratio.\" Notice the difference?  We'd all like to be in that majority, but I'm not going to take chances by not wearing my sleeve and gauntlet. otter  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64/topic/725862?page=1#post_1150476 Shepherd, I used to teach a course where I we examined the \"evidence\" behind things that were done at routine physicals, based on the US Task force, where the best evidence is a randomized, placebo controlled, double blind study and the lowest evidence is clinical observation, and we were all shocked that most things we routinely did, and considered important, had no evidence to support it. The whole evidence based medicine movement is about a decade old, and while good things have come from it, it's the old \"garbage in: garbage out\"--if the study is flawed, it doesn't help, and some things just aren't studied. Also, as Otter pointed out in her analysis, often the conclusio on an abstract doesn't reflect the detailed data in a study. The weight lifting study in the NEJM said: Conclusions In breast-cancer survivors with lymphedema, slowly progressive weight lifting had no significant effect on limb swelling and resulted in a decreased incidence of exacerbations of lymphedema, reduced symptoms, and increased strength. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00194363 [ClinicalTrials.gov] .) Yet that's a vast over simplification: only a tiny percent of women screened met criteria for inclusion in the study--so a more detailed conclusion might be: \"In breast cancer survivors with lymphedema, whose lymphedema is stable, and who have access to custom garments and well trained therapists to evaluate them in a timely manner, and can participate in a weight lifting protocol that was overseen by specially trained trainers, weight lifting had no significant effect on limb swelling and resulted in ...etc\" The risk reduction guidelines are just that--guidelines. I feel like we're all defending our points, and arguing, but what are we arguing about? Whether Susan Love was cavalier to the point of dangerous (my contention) or that much of what we know about lymphedema is not based on solid evidence--a result of few studies having been done, and some misinterpretation of studies that have been done. I found the Q&A with Katie Schmidtz really interesting: she's an epidemiologist, not a clinician. Kira  I just checked; the abstract was presented by Dr. Kibreath PhD from Australia, the abstract has not yet been published as a full article. ",

Here, she's just plain wrong, IMO. The one study showed that some women could fly without sleeves, but other women--especially on long flights--developed worsened LE. The weight lifting study showed that if done carefully, with LE, it can be safe, but it doesn't cure LE. Where does she--an expert--get off telling women that risk reduction behaviors should be questioned?? Where is she when a woman gets LE after a blood draw, an IV, a long flight without garments.

To me, a worsening after getting off of antibiotics is an important clinical trend, and indicates an infection. I once had a bone infection after a sinus surgery, and was on about 6 months of antibiotics. Sometimes for compromised tissue, like tissue that has been through surgery and/or radiation, it can get a very stubborn infection. I understand that the infectious disease people may not be able to culture a bug anymore, after all the antibiotics, but what is their alternate explanation, and how do they propose to help you?  Classic signs of cellulitis are redness, heat, pain. I know you're literally sick and tired of this, but it seems like you shouldn't have to be managing your own care right now. I would agree with Binney that it would be better if a physician was involved right now. There are a few women on the site right now with protracted bouts of skin infection and at some point their treatment team seems to get frustrated and say \"it's not an infection\"--alright, then what is it, and how are you going to treat it? I personally think that the stakes are too high not to treat is as an infection. Just my opinion, and most of all I would love to see you not having to manage this on your own. Kira ",

As a result of the passing of the Act, which makes certain indigenous tribes and organisations eligible to access the health plans for federal employees, ImpediMed expects an increase in covered lives for federal healthcare plans from 1 May 2012. The estimated number of employees of indigenous tribes or organisations who are eligible to access federal health plans is about 350,000. Direct family members of these employees are also eligible and include spouse and children up to the age of 26. As a result, coverage under federal plans could be expected to increase by an estimated 700,000 covered lives. Lymphoedema occurs when the lymphatic system does not work properly, resulting in the long-term swelling of parts of the body. Stanford Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry Meanwhile, the first patient has been enrolled into the Stanford Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry. Stanford University Medical Center initiated the registry which will collect and analyse data from breast centres and physicians' offices across the U.S. The registry collects clearly defined health and demographic information on patients with specific health characteristics, in this case, breast cancer. The Stanford Breast Cancer Lymphedema Registry has been designed to investigate the impact of lymphoedema surveillance upon breast cancer survivors. Within a year, researchers expect to have gained further substantial insights into the value of systematic early surveillance to prevent and minimise the lymphoedema risk in women treated for breast cancer. Patient enrolment will increase in the coming months as the registry is rolled out to physician sites. Data generated from ImpediMed's L-Dex® U400 device will make-up one arm of the registry. The L-Dex® U400 device is the first medical device with a US Food and Drug Administration clearance to aid health care professionals, clinically assess secondary unilateral lymphoedema of the arm and leg in women and the leg in men.

The evidence published in the peer-reviewed literature to date consists mainly of studies evaluating the technical and diagnostic performance of bioimpedance measurement devices as compared with other established methods of assessment for lymphedema. The oldest study by Cornish et al (2001) enrolled 102 women, and measured bioimpedance and circumferential measurements at 2-month intervals for 24 months. The authors reported that bioimpedance detected 22 patients with lymphedema, 20 of which were confirmed. In contrast, only one case of lymphedema was detected using circumferential measurement. The authors reported 100% sensitivity and 98% specificity for bioimpedance in this study. Box and colleagues (2002) compared bioimpedance with water displacement and circumferential measurement in 65 women, with assessments performed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Lymphedema was confirmed in 12 of 57 women at 24 months, all of them correctly identified by water displacement. Bioimpedance detected only 8 cases, and circumferential measurement 7. The authors did not state whether these numbers were significant, possibly because of the lack of statistical reliability due to the small size of the study. The largest comparative study (n=287) was that of Hayes et al (2008). This comparative study among bioimpedance, circumferential measurement and patient self-assessment compiled measurements at 3 month intervals for one year, beginning six months after surgery. Circumferential measurements showed 42% sensitivity and 88% specificity. For self-assessment, sensitivity and specificity were 61% and 59% respectively. Bioimpedance in this study was assumed to be the most accurate method yet there was no evaluation of false negative or false positive results that were correctly addressed by the other techniques. Ward and colleagues (2009) compared bioimpedance with perometry in a study group of 45 women who were known to have lymphedema following breast surgery. Although there was correlation between bioimpedance and perometry results, bioimpedance gave false negative readings in 27%. When this figure was tested in a group of healthy women (n=21) who had had no surgery, similar results were reported. No studies were found that focused on the clinical utility of bioimpedance. The evidence therefore does not permit conclusions as to whether bioimpedance assessment of lymphedema improves health outcomes. 3. The technology must improve the net health outcome: Results of the available studies do not provide clear evidence that bioimpedance improves net health outcomes. Possible harms could possibly result from the false negative readings, leading to failure to intervene against developing lymphedema, so further studies are needed to determine whether bioimpedance is a reliable assessment tool. Promoters of bioimpedance maintain that it is able to detect lymphedema earlier, leading to improved outcomes through earlier intervention, but studies could not be found to confirm this assumption. http://www.bcbsde.com/ProviderPolicies/public_site/2.01.62_Bioimpedance_for_Assessment_of_Lymphedema.htm",

I am so sick of impedimed's influence on the LE researchers: 1) The Avon White Paper was a plea to get insurance coverage for their device and implied a cure for LE if caught early--they used major researchers to give this an appearance of a important concensus document. And got sponsorship from the LE foundations 2) Their fake patient website: they got caught in fraud and a lie--and posted private patient histories on facebook, pretending to be a patient community, while they were marketing their device 3) The Stanford Registry is sponsored by impedimed, yet this is not made clear, and their ability to access patient records is unclear as well. I've asked all the LANA board if they find bioimpedance helpful--and they find it minimally useful, but it is relatively insensitve, needs proper use--prone patient, empty bladder, no caffeine or alcohol--and it is serial measurements that are helpful--if they are helpful--not one. And if there is fibrosis, the machine is not useful--admitted to Binney by the company, but their website says it can be used in all stages of LE. We want objective measurements and early detection, but we/I don't want lies and deception and mining of my data to sell a device that may or may not be of any use in early detection, and could easily be misused--we had a woman with a visibly swollen arm be told she didn't have LE based on a single reading.... This is typical medical/pharma behavior, it just hasn't shown up in the LE world before. Because LE wasn't a money maker for anyone before. Kira",

Dr. Love couldn't even interpret the evidence of Kathryn Schmidtz' well designed study, which only proved that in carefully selected women with LE, most could tolerate weight lifting. That's it--no improvement of the disease process or elimination of it--just fewer self-reported flares.  The best evidence is a double blind, randomized, placebo controlled study: Hmm, let's see how to prove that IV's are safe in arms where lymph nodes have been removed--how do place a placebo IV? There are Instituitional Review Boards for any study that involves human subjects and no study of lymphedema risk reduction, where the active group could get an incurable disease would be allowed to participate in such a study. So, then you have observational studies: observe women who may have had an IV and see if they develop LE--there's none out there. Often, the evidence turns out, when followed over time, to be mistaken. In the 1990's I was to teach my medical students that HRT benefits far outweighed risks, I was to flunk them if they didn't recommend HRT to a standardized patient. Then came the Women's Health Initiative, and the evidence rapidly shifted. There was a study where sham knee surgeries were done for arthritis--patients were put to sleep, got an incision and no surgery, and they did as well as the people who got the surgery. It proved that arthrosopic surgery for knee arthritis was useless, yet I still see orthopedic surgeons doing it. Susan Love's comments are beyond irresponsible: Stay Tuned--for what? An increase in LE due to her unfounded inferences that risk reductions, because they've never been adequately studied are invalid? Some studies can not be done, and some will not be done, as they won't make anyone money and there's no funding. And without studies you have to base your behavior on clinical judgement. Susan Love demonstrated a lack of judgement, IMO. Long before she quit clinical medicine to get her MBA, she took an oath to do no harm. Well, she seems to have forgotten that. Stick around medicine long enough, and you'll see enough pendulum swings to learn that hard evidence is often quite shaky. If she was at risk of LE, would she let someone crush her arm with a blood pressure cuff, run an IV, use a tourniquet? I wonder... Kira ",

You know, when you \"stump\" the people you're dealing with, they have a tendency to transfer their frustration to you. It's so unfair. I'm glad you got another person to confirm your reality. It's so hard to fight for care when you're feeling lousy, and frustrated. Pat--if your surgeon is going to be over-possessive (and to me it sounds like arrogant and threatened) then he has to be available to you 24/7--just intimidating the ER staff and calling up people who suggest second opinions doesn't translate into taking good care of you. If he's going to be over-possessive, then I'd prefer if he was checking on you, possessively, all the time. Glad you brought a witness and support, it does help. As Judy said, we have to lobby for ourselves. Unfortunate, but true.   I wrote about some of my experiences for a writing class recently, and another member of the class said \"I was wondering if you were a difficult patient.\" And a physician in the class said \"Difficult patient is something created by the medical community to blame the victim.\" No one likes conflict, especially when we want support from our health care team, but too often, advocating for yourself, or just not getting better on their time table, makes you a difficult patient. Suze and Pat, hoping that you feel better very, very soon. Judy, I hope you win the ultimate contest--healing well.  Kira",

N Engl J Med 2009;361:664-73. Copyright © 2009 Massachusetts Medical Society. Background Weight lifting has generally been proscribed for women with breast-cancer\u2013related lymphedema, preventing them from obtaining the well-established health benefits of weight lifting, including increases in bone density. Methods We performed a randomized, controlled trial of twice-weekly progressive weight lifting involving 141 breast-cancer survivors with stable lymphedema of the arm. The primary outcome was the change in arm and hand swelling at 1 year, as measured through displaced water volume of the affected and unaffected limbs. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of exacerbations of lymphedema, number and severity of lymphedema symptoms, and muscle strength. Participants were required to wear a well-fitted compression garment while weight lifting. Results The proportion of women who had an increase of 5% or more in limb swelling was similar in the weight-lifting group (11%) and the control group (12%) (cumulative incidence ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.13). As compared with the control group, the weight-lifting group had greater improvements in self-reported severity of lymphedema symptoms (P = 0.03) and upper- and lower-body strength (P<0.001 for both comparisons) and a lower incidence of lymphedema exacerbations as assessed by a certified lymphedema specialist (14% vs. 29%, P = 0.04). There were no serious adverse events related to the intervention. Conclusions In breast-cancer survivors with lymphedema, slowly progressive weight lifting had no significant effect on limb swelling and resulted in a decreased incidence of exacerbations of lymphedema, reduced symptoms, and increased strength.

It is the results of the PAL's study fromn U Penn, where about 300 women, half with LE were enrolled in in a YMCA training program with specially trained instructors. Notice the outcomes: uring the course of the study, women in the weightlifting group experienced fewer exacerbations of their condition, and a reduction in symptoms compared to the women who did not lift weights. There were 19 women in the control group who experienced lymphedema exacerbations that required treatment from a physical therapist, compared to 9 in the treatment group. The proportion of women who experienced an increase of five percent or more in their limb swelling was similar in both groups -- 11 percent of the weight-lifting group and 12 percent in the control group. The researchers theorize that a controlled weightlifting program may have protective benefits, by boosting strength in affected limbs enough to ward off injuries from everyday activities that can aggravate lymphedema symptoms. 1) No real change in swelling between the two, small groups 2) More flares, yet it's not clear if it's stastically significant 3) Less \"symptoms\"--but until the formal article, we don't know what that consists of This group has long had a bias that women should be weight lifting, they work with a PT: \"Dr. Linda T Miller (has a bachelor's degree and gives weekend courses to PT's but won't be LANA certified, and it's unclear how she can call herself doctor) I think they want us to inprove the quality of our life and with care, try some strengthening, but even in theur publication that talked about the preliminary study they had problems with consistency of the trainers.

Unfortunately, the media does not, and the researchers, in their zeal to liberate us, over-simplify. I'm pleased any article on LE showed up in NE Journal, when their review of radiation to the breast did not mention LE as a side effect.... Jane, the articles you sent me make me livid: From Electra Paskett, herself a LE sister, who studies LE \"Great story. Solid study. Very important problem that has received very little attention in the past. We have a similar study onging to try to prevent lyphedema in women who are having surgery for breast cancer. 1) This was NOT for prevention: the average woman was more than 5 years out, and had to have established but stable LE. Not at all the same goal as her study, which uses exercise to try and prevent LE. Apples and oranges. From USA Today: www.usatoday.com/news/health/2...  Exercise reduces breast cancer side effects Breast cancer survivors for years have been told not to lift weights for fear of developing an incurable condition called lymphedema, a complication of cancer surgery that can cause painful swelling in the arm. To prevent the disabling condition, women have been told to virtually \"put their arm in a box,\" says Jennifer Ligibel of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. And yet--this study was NOT about prevention, but to test our ability to exercise with LE A small side box says: EXERCISE CAUTION Aerobic activities such as walking are usually safe for women who have had breast cancer, says Jennifer Ligibel of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. But women should approach weight-lifting with care, even if they had lifted weights before their treatment, says Kathryn Schmitz of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Women should work with an instructor to learn the proper technique rather than begin lifting weights on their own, she says. The American College of Sports Medicine offers a special certification for working with cancer survivors, Schmitz says. Thanks to funding from the Lance Armstrong Foundation (livestrong.org), YMCAs in 20 metro areas offer weight-training programs for breast cancer survivors. Ten additional metro areas expect to receive funding in the next year, Schmitz says. And, if you actually read down into the article: Up to 70% of breast cancer survivors experience some symptoms of lymphedema, although many cases are mild, a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine shows. The new findings show that women with lymphedema who follow a carefully designed strength-training program can build muscle while cutting the risk of painful flare-ups in half. Yet, we know, that the absolute numbers of women with flares were small, and the study was NEVER about prevention. I wrote to the author of the study before its publication, because she'd published a prelimary article, and what I wanted was details: how to carefully weight lift. Exactly how. We've heard from Erica/Barbara who worked with a trainer trained for cancer patients by Mass General, and the weight lifitng caused her to swell. If they're going to hype this--get the facts right: this was not about prevention, but about testing our limitations, and the weight lifting didn't shrink anyone's arms, just 14 less women flared. If you're going to report to the world that our limitations are less--then make it clear that this is not about preventing LE, but strengthening women with LE, and the study only allowed a tiny minority of women in--those who were completely stable with their LE--yet even women with stable LE flared, both in the study and the control arm. I hate inaccurate reporting, and I think this has upset so many of us, because we know our bodies and this denies our reality and our knowledge. MOTC: I did everything right, and there was no history of breast ca in my family, and I found a lump 6 months after a normal mammogram, and my gyn only ordered the diagnostic mammogram to placate me. Then she continued to say \"But it couldn't be felt\"--then why did I make the appointment? We know our bodies and none of us wants to be limited, we just don't want to be ignored, patronized and left out of the discussion that includes us. Kira",

Patients have a treatment team. In my case, the surgery clearly caused my LE: came on three weeks post-op, but my breast surgeon was a jerk--flat out told me she \"was not responsible\" to help me manage it, and her in house LE clinic was suboptimal, so I turned to my PCP for referrals. My onc would be glad to do it, but my PCP is more accessible, and I don't like the in-house LE clinic at my onc's hospital either--the first clinic had Vodder trained LMT's but run as \"alternative therapy\" by a nutritionist, and the second has a LANA certified PT who was just horrible--as soon as she measured my arms and found no volume change--my LE is in my hand and treated, but I still had cording at that point--she never touched me, but prescribed theraband exercises that caused new cords. There is no one prescribed member of your team who is responsible for LE: often none of them are knowledgable about it: go with the physician who is most accessible and most responsive. I work in rad onc and I refer patients all the time: I interviewed all qualified therapists in my region, had my personal experience, and closely monitor patients in treatment--it's still not ideal, but I try.

Patients remain at risk for life-studies of axillary node dissection patients show that the majority develop lymphedema in the first few years after surgery, and then at least 1%/year develop it, so that the incidence at 20 years of follow up is 50%.

      "Content": "kira wrote: Found this on Medscape, I'll link the arm volume calculator:Software Predicts Lymphedema Risk After Axillary Dissection Tool for Deciding About Surgery? Nick Mulcahy September 7, 2011 - Newly developed mathematical models are at least 70% accurate in predicting the risk for lymphedema in women undergoing axillary dissection as part of their breast cancer treatment, according to Brazilian researchers. The software models, or nomograms, were developed in conjunction with the largest-ever prospective study of lymphedema occurrence, said José Bevilacqua, MD, PhD, a surgical oncologist at Hospital Sirio Libanes in Sao Paulo, Brazil. He spoke at a press conference held in advance of the 2011 Breast Cancer Symposium, being held September 8 to 10 in San Francisco, California, where the new study will be presented as a poster. The ability to predict lymphedema is \"an important step forward\" that \"allows us to identify patients who can be appropriately triaged for early intervention\" of the condition, said Andrew Seidman, MD, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who moderated the press briefing. Dr. Bevilacqua concurred with that assessment, but had an additional proposal: that the nomograms could be used in discussions with some patients about the \"necessity\" of surgery. Dr. Seidman did not comment directly on that idea, but noted that it was \"interesting\" that the study \"comes at a real time of transition in the management of the axilla.\" \"Fewer women need to undergo axillary dissection today than decades ago,\" Dr. Seidman said. But patients with \"more extensive lymph node involvement\" still need the procedure, he pointed out. The need for axillary dissection might be influenced by the number of involved nodes and the type of treatment a patient receives, such as regional radiation, he suggested. A number of recent trials in early breast cancer have evaluated axillary dissection. A landmark trial in early breast cancer published this year found that, in certain women with 0 to 2 positive nodes, sentinel lymph node dissection did not result in inferior survival, compared with axillary dissection. In addition, a trial presented at the 2011 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology raised questions about the need for axillary dissection in women with early breast cancer and 1 to 3 positive nodes who are treated with regional nodal irradiation. In the prospective study by Dr. Bevilacqua and colleagues, 1054 women with breast cancer underwent axillary dissection in 2001 and 2002. The overall 5-year incidence of lymphedema in the cohort was 30.3%. This incidence was expected, reported Dr. Bevilacqua, who explained that the chronic condition affects about one third of patients worldwide who have axillary lymph node surgery. The median follow-up was 41 months, and 66 patients were lost to follow-up, he said. The arm volume of patients was measured with a simple measuring tape immediately before and after surgery, and every 6 months thereafter. The Models, Variables and Findings Using mathematical software, the investigators developed 3 models to predict the risk of developing lymphedema, which was defined as a volume difference of at least 200 mL between arms at 6 months or more after surgery. The 3 models differ in a couple of ways: the point in time that risk is assessed and the variables used. Model 1 predicted lymphedema risk in the study population in advance of axillary dissection. The model uses variables such as age, body mass index, and the number of chemotherapy infusions in the ipsilateral arm prior to surgery. Dr. Bevilacqua and his colleagues compared the predictions of model 1 with the actual occurrence of lymphedema in this group of women, and found a \"concordance index\" of 0.706. Model 2 predicted risk up to 6 months after surgery. It uses the same predictors as the first model, along with the extent of axillary dissection and the location of the radiotherapy field. The model had a concordance index of 0.729. Model 3 predicted risk 6 months or more after surgery. It includes the variables of the development of postoperative seroma, infection, and early edema. The model had a concordance index of 0.736. In short, all 3 models correctly predicted that a patient would develop lymphedema roughly 7 in 10 times. Dr. Bevilacqua noted that the accuracy of the models was on par with the accuracy of mammography in detecting breast cancer. Dr. Bevilacqua said that he and his team plan to refine the models to increase their accuracy. Currently, some of their tools are available online for free. A tool to calculate arm volume can be accessed at www.armvolume.com. The models to estimate the risk for lymphedema are available during the 2011 Breast Cancer Symposium (until September 10) at www.lymphedemarisk.com. Early Intervention The nomograms and their ability to assess risk for lymphedema raise a \"bigger question,\" Dr. Seidman noted. \"Can some form of early intervention be useful?\" A \"world of lymphedema experts\" believe \"early intervention matters,\" he said. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering, a team of physical rehabilitation experts is attempting to \"control the progression of lymphedema.\" Methods for treating and controlling the condition include the use of compression garments, arm elevation, not carrying backpacks and purses on the affected side of the body, and moderate exercise. Supposedly the arm volume calculator is just available for a few days: www.armvolume.com/ www.lymphedemarisk.com/ So I did my LE risk: and if I put in that I had info on XRT (radiation), it forced me to put in an axillary dissection, but also opened a field that asked if I had a seroma. Risk=38%. If I put in that I didn't have info on XRT (radiation), it didn't open up the seroma tab, and risk was 14%. Still double what I was quoted. I think it would be a better tool if seroma was available all the time. I'd love to see the actual study, as we all know that LE has no formal definition, so incidence varies widely, depending on how you define it. And 200ml difference is a pretty big difference, and my hand/forearm LE wouldn't make the definition. Interesting though. Adding seroma, early swelling and infection increased the sensitivity of the model to 73%. Kira 2011 Breast Cancer Symposium. Abstract 8. To be presented September 8, 2011.

They don't treat it, and all we ask is for a referal--it's lack of information, denial and some sort of shame at a \"bad outcome\" is my theory. I don't know much about capsular contractures, but I do know about cording--cording is due to thrombosed lymphatics and veins and is caused by trauma, but can recur. Here's a link to an article about it. It is treated by stretching and a specific form of myofascial release by well trained PT's--the latest belief is NOT to try and pop the cords. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm Lymphedema is made worse by scars and contractures--anything that impedes lymph flow. So, cording is unique to lymphatic vessels (and some veins) and it occurs when trauma causes the lymph vessels to clot off. I would imagine that all that scarring is causing a lot of pain and could contribute to LE as lymph has trouble moving across scars. It makes me so angry to hear about the surgical run-around you had to deal with to get a referral. Hopefully someone who can give you better answers will come along soon. Kira ",

There was no history of trauma. Eleven months earlier, she had undergone a wide local excision with axillary lymph-node dissection for an invasive ductal carcinoma (T2N0, 2.5 cm in diameter) of the ipsilateral breast. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she did not receive perioperative antibiotics. Surgery was followed by six courses of chemotherapy and 50 Gy of radiotherapy on the right breast. Examination of the breast revealed erythema, tenderness, and warmth, none of which crossed the midline, but no masses or lymphedema was palpable. The white-cell count was 13,300 per cubic millimeter. Ultrasonography showed no evidence of a soft-tissue abscess. The diagnosis of cellulitis was made, and the patient received oral antibiotics, with complete resolution of symptoms. A follow-up mammogram 6 weeks later showed no evidence of recurrent cancer.    ",

NLN Position Paper: Exercise Page 1 of 6 POSITION STATEMENT OF THE NATIONAL LYMPHEDEMA NETWORK By: NLN Medical Advisory Committee Updated December 2011 TOPIC: EXERCISE Fitness and Exercise: It is very important for individuals with lymphedema to be physically fit and maintain a healthy weight. A safe form of exercise is an essential part of a fitness program for people with lymphedema. Fitness and exercise are not the same. Exercise includes many different types of physical movement. The three main types of exercise are: aerobic, strength, and flexibility. These three types of exercise, along with Lymphedema Remedial Exercises, are addressed in this paper. There are many other types of exercise that have health benefits such as Pilates, yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, aquatic exercise,1 trampoline rebounding, breathing exercises,2 and relaxation exercise that have not been adequately studied in people with lymphedema. However, the person with lymphedema can use the benefits of any system of exercise if he/she follows the general safety principles of exercise with lymphedema, seeks medical guidance, and uses caution in starting any new exercise program. Exercise and types of lymphedema: Lymphedema has many causes. The type of exercise that is best for an individual depends upon the severity and cause of lymphedema and other co\u2010existing medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, etc). Exercise for breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema is the most studied lymphedema condition. Many conclusions about exercise and lymphedema are based on studies of breast cancer survivors that may or may not apply to other forms of lymphedema. Lymphedema Remedial Exercise: Lymphedema Remedial Exercise is a part of treatment for lymphedema when reduction of size of a limb is necessary. Lymphedema Remedial Exercise involves active, repetitive, non\u2010resistive motion of the involved body part. Exercise in Phase I and Phase II Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) (see Position Paper \"Diagnosis and Treatment of Lymphedema\" www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntr...)'>www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntr... is performed with compression as an essential part of the total (complete) reductive phase of lymphedema therapy.3\u20105 Lymphedema exercises, used with compression, help the body's natural muscle pump to increase venous and lymphatic fluid return to the circulatory system and out of the swollen areas. Remedial Exercises for lymphedema are similar to some movements of low impact Tai Chi and Qigong, but are different in that lymphedema Remedial Exercise is used with Phase I treatment of lymphedema to reduce size of the body part. Lymphedema Remedial Exercise has been studied and shown to reduce limb swelling.3\u20105 It is unknown whether Lymphedema Remedial Exercise alone can prevent lymphedema in at\u2010risk individuals, or whether they can maintain reduction of swelling without compression. Flexibility or Stretching Exercises: Flexibility exercises include a wide range of activities that stretch muscle and connective tissues to increase and/or preserve range of motion. Flexibility exercises can minimize skin scarring and joint contractures that may lessen lymph flow. Flexibility exercises should be performed slowly and progressed gradually. Flexibility exercises are not a treatment for lymphedema, but are a part of optimal lifestyle management for reducing the complications of lymphedema. Lymphedema has a tendency to restrict motion of muscles and joints. Optimal lymphatic function requires full mobility of muscles and joints. Lymphedema from cancer treatment can be associated with tight muscles and connective tissues due to fibrous adhesions from surgery or radiation. Tight muscles and scars from surgery or radiation may require Physical or Occupational Therapy to treat before attempting to do self\u2010stretching. Specific stretching exercises for cancer treatment\u2010related scars and joint restrictions in an area at risk of lymphedema should be prescribed by a provider familiar with the management of lymphedema. A specialized form of stretching exercise may be required for Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) or axillary cording, a condition that can occur in cancer survivors who have had axillary (armpit) lymph nodes removed.6 AWS may benefit from treatment by a certified lymphedema therapist and specific home stretches taught by a therapist.7 Resistance or Weight\u2010Lifting Exercise: Resistance exercises are usually thought of as weight\u2010lifting. Resistance exercises may involve lifting body weight (such as push\u2010ups) or lifting objects (such as dumbbells, weight machines, etc). Resistance exercises can be performed without moving a joint (isometric) or by moving the joint through a range of motion (isotonic). All of these types of resistance exercise may be utilized by individuals with lymphedema, but should be done cautiously, starting with low weights, low repetitions, and gradual progression. Resistance exercises are performed against an opposing load to enhance muscle power, stamina, and tone. Resistance exercise may reduce limb volume when used as an adjunct to compression therapy8 One study showed that guided participation in resistance exercise, as a part of a total fitness program, did not increase the risk of developing lymphedema in breast cancer patients at risk over the group who did not exercise.9 Lymphedema did occur in both groups. No increase in lymphedema development was noted between the exercise and the non\u2010exercise group. There have been many studies on resistance exercise in breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema that show no harmful effect on lymphedema and beneficial effects for overall health. Aerobic Conditioning or Cardiopulmonary Exercise: Aerobic conditioning exercise is often referred to as \"cardio\" exercise. Aerobic exercise involves activity that uses large muscle groups to increase the heart rate to 60\u201070% of an individual's maximum heart rate. This type of exercise, when progressed gradually, ncreases the heart and lung capacity while also improving muscle conditioning. Aerobic conditioning enhances cardiovascular fitness, effective weight management, and overall health and well\u2010being, all of which are very beneficial to people with lymphedema from all causes.10\u201021 Walking, jogging, cycling, and swimming are examples of aerobic conditioning exercise. Aerobic conditioning has not been studied formally as a treatment for lymphedema. One study showed no adverse effect on lymphedema from aerobic exercise.17 Resistance Exercise plus Aerobic Exercise: Studies of combined resistance and aerobic exercise have shown no adverse effects on lymphedema.21 No studies have specifically evaluated resistance plus aerobic exercise as a stand\u2010alone treatment for lymphedema. One study in breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema showed that the individuals who performed aerobic conditioning and weight lifting had better control of their lymphedema and had fewer flares of lymphedema than those who did not exercise. However, individuals with lymphedema still had to utilize standard lymphedema therapy techniques for flares.21 Another study about women at risk for breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema showed that aerobic conditioning and weight\u2010lifting reduced the risk of developing lymphedema. Considerations for Designing an Exercise Program: A number of studies have shown that aerobic and resistance exercises are safe and beneficial for people with lymphedema or at risk of lymphedema if they follow the guidelines for progressing slowly, use recommended compression, and report any adverse effects to a professional who can help them adapt their exercise regimen.9,16\u201021 Most studies on lymphedema and exercise have been done on breast cancer survivors, but the principles may guide exercise in other forms of lymphedema. Individuals with or at risk of lymphedema must report other health conditions that need to be considered in developing a personal exercise regimen (diabetes, heart disease, neuropathy, arthritis, etc). Modifications of aerobic and resistance exercise that are commonly recommended for individuals with lymphedema are: 1) Allowing adequate rest intervals between sets; 2) Avoiding weights that wrap tightly around an extremity or clothing that cause constriction; 3) Wearing compression sleeves or bandages during exercise; 4) Maintaining hydration; 5) Avoiding extreme heat or overheating; 6) Exercising in a circuit that alters the type of exercise and body part within the exercise session. Exercise and Compression Garments: Lymphedema Remedial Exercise as a part of CDT requires compression garments or bandages.3\u20105 There are no studies on the use of compression garments when performing stretching or flexibility exercise alone. The NLN Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) recommends using the guidelines for aerobic and resistance exercise to guide use of compression during flexibility exercise since flexibility exercises may be combined with other forms of exercise. The amount and type of compression for exercise should be decided with input from a professional knowledgeable about lymphedema. There is no strong evidence basis for the use of compression garments during exercise; however, most experts in the field of lymphedema advise the use of compression during vigorous exercise for people with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema. One study suggested that individuals with lymphedema who do resistance exercise without compression may increase swelling.20 Resistance exercise may reduce limb volume when used as an adjunct to compression therapy in people with confirmed lymphedema.8 One study showed that aerobic and weight\u2010lifting exercise was safely performed without compression in women at risk for breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema.9 That study showed patients who developed lymphedema could continue to exercise with compression garments. Compression garments should be measured by an individual trained and experienced in fitting compression garments for lymphedema and should be at least Class I compression for upper extremity. Higher classes may be required for more severe lymphedema and for lower extremity lymphedema. A hand piece (gauntlet or glove) is recommended when exercising with a sleeve to avoid causing or exacerbating hand swelling. Definition of Individuals At Risk for Lymphedema: Individuals at risk for lymphedema have not displayed signs and symptoms of lymphedema but may have sustained damage to their lymphatic systems through surgical lymph node removal or radiation therapy. Additionally, individuals at risk may have surgical incisions in the vicinity of lymph transport vessels. Individuals who have family members with hereditary lymphedema may also be at risk. An individual's risk of lymphedema may change over time depending on factors such as weight gain, age, and changes in medical condition. It is the position of the NLN that:  Exercise is a part of a healthy lifestyle and is essential for effective lymphedema management  Before starting any exercise program, individuals should be cleared for the program of activity by their physician.  Lymphedema Exercises (also known as Remedial Exercises) are specific rhythmic muscle and breathing exercises used as a part of lymphedema treatment in Phase I and Phase II Complete Decongestive Therapy (see the NLN Position Paper on Diagnosis and Treatment). www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntr... In Phase II lymphedema maintenance, these exercises can be combined with or integrated into a regular exercise program.  After intensive treatment with CDT, the person with lymphedema should work with the certified lymphedema therapist or qualified lymphedema specialist provider (MD, NP) to adapt their remedial exercises into their fitness and weight management program at the time they are moving from Phase I (treatment phase) to Phase II (self management).  Individuals with or at risk for lymphedema can and should perform aerobic and resistance exercise in a safe manner.  The individual with or at risk for lymphedema may benefit from working with an Exercise Physiologist and/or Personal Trainer. The person with lymphedema should inquire if the trainer or exercise physiologist has experience working with lymphedema and other medical conditions. Certification for personal trainers varies. Patients who are unsure of about the qualifications of a community exercise practitioner should work with a certified lymphedema therapist or health care provider to assist them in finding a community exercise program or professional.  In general, individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema should utilize compression garments or compression bandages during exercise.  Individuals at risk for lymphedema may or may not utilize compression garments during exercise; this is an individual decision to be made with guidance from a care provider and/or therapist based on risk, activity, and conditioning level.  Individuals at risk for lymphedema will benefit from most forms of exercise tailored to their individual needs.  Individuals at risk for or with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema should avoid repetitive overuse of the affected part. Sudden increase in an individual's usual exercise duration or intensity may trigger or worsen lymphedema. It is likely that a program of slowly progressive exercise for the affected body part will decrease the potential for common daily activities to result in overuse.  Exercise should be started gradually, increased cautiously, and stopped for pain, increased swelling, or discomfort.  The risks of exercise for the individual with or at risk for lymphedema must be balanced against the risks of deconditioning that undoubtedly results from not exercising. A deconditioned body part with or at risk for lymphedema can do progressively less without risk of overuse. As a result, exercise is recommended for those with and at risk for lymphedema.  The NLN cannot specifically determine the safety of exercise for any individual. The guidelines in this Position Paper provide general principles, but do not substitute for medical evaluation and recommendations from a health care professional. It is the responsibility of all individuals with or at risk for lymphedema to consult with their health care provider regarding their own specific needs.

All of these types of resistance exercise may be utilized by individuals with lymphedema, but should be done cautiously, starting with low weights, low repetitions, and gradual progression.  Nancy Hutchinson should have said: Resistance exercise can be utilized in lymphedema, but should be controlled--therefore use of free weights or calibrated machines--can be used cautiously, etc. Knowing the folks at the NLN, we'll get our heads bitten off if we inform them of this, but it's a very important point, and I remember the LE PT who saw the woman who developed the truncal LE getting so upset about the pushups. I'm actually a bit concerned about the lack of clarification after what you've told us, Carol, but I've fought enough LE battles this week to last me a long time, I'm still feeling upset about the impedimed debacle.

Lymphedema Remedial Exercise has been studied and shown to reduce limb swelling.3\u20105 It is unknown whether Lymphedema Remedial Exercise alone can prevent lymphedema in at\u2010risk individuals, or whether they can maintain reduction of swelling without compression. Flexibility or Stretching Exercises: Flexibility exercises include a wide range of activities that stretch muscle and connective tissues to increase and/or preserve range of motion. Flexibility exercises can minimize skin scarring and joint contractures that may lessen lymph flow. Flexibility exercises should be performed slowly and progressed gradually. Flexibility exercises are not a treatment for lymphedema, but are a part of optimal lifestyle management for reducing the complications of lymphedema. Lymphedema has a tendency to restrict motion of muscles and joints. Optimal lymphatic function requires full mobility of muscles and joints. Lymphedema from cancer treatment can be associated with tight muscles and connective tissues due to fibrous adhesions from surgery or radiation. Tight muscles and scars from surgery or radiation may require Physical or Occupational Therapy to treat before attempting to do self\u2010stretching. Specific stretching exercises for cancer treatment\u2010related scars and joint restrictions in an area at risk of lymphedema should be prescribed by a provider familiar with the management of lymphedema. A specialized form of stretching exercise may be required for Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS) or axillary cording, a condition that can occur in cancer survivors who have had axillary (armpit) lymph nodes removed.6 AWS may benefit from treatment by a certified lymphedema therapist and specific home stretches taught by a therapist.7 Resistance or Weight\u2010Lifting Exercise: Resistance exercises are usually thought of as weight\u2010lifting. Resistance exercises may involve lifting body weight (such as push\u2010ups) or lifting objects (such as dumbbells, weight machines, etc). Resistance exercises can be performed without moving a joint (isometric) or by moving the joint through a range of motion (isotonic). All of these types of resistance exercise may be utilized by individuals with lymphedema, but should be done cautiously, starting with low weights, low repetitions, and gradual progression. Resistance exercises are performed against an opposing load to enhance muscle power, stamina, and tone. Resistance exercise may reduce limb volume when used as an adjunct to compression therapy8 One study showed that guided participation in resistance exercise, as a part of a total fitness program, did not increase the risk of developing lymphedema in breast cancer patients at risk over the group who did not exercise.9 Lymphedema did occur in both groups. No increase in lymphedema development was noted between the exercise and the non\u2010exercise group. There have been many studies on resistance exercise in breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema that show no harmful effect on lymphedema and beneficial effects for overall health. Aerobic Conditioning or Cardiopulmonary Exercise: Aerobic conditioning exercise is often referred to as \"cardio\" exercise. Aerobic exercise involves activity that uses large muscle groups to increase the heart rate to 60\u201070% of an individual's maximum heart rate. This type of exercise, when progressed gradually, ncreases the heart and lung capacity while also improving muscle conditioning. Aerobic conditioning enhances cardiovascular fitness, effective weight management, and overall health and well\u2010being, all of which are very beneficial to people with lymphedema from all causes.10\u201021 Walking, jogging, cycling, and swimming are examples of aerobic conditioning exercise. Aerobic conditioning has not been studied formally as a treatment for lymphedema. One study showed no adverse effect on lymphedema from aerobic exercise.17 Resistance Exercise plus Aerobic Exercise: Studies of combined resistance and aerobic exercise have shown no adverse effects on lymphedema.21 No studies have specifically evaluated resistance plus aerobic exercise as a stand\u2010alone treatment for lymphedema. One study in breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema showed that the individuals who performed aerobic conditioning and weight lifting had better control of their lymphedema and had fewer flares of lymphedema than those who did not exercise. However, individuals with lymphedema still had to utilize standard lymphedema therapy techniques for flares.21 Another study about women at risk for breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema showed that aerobic conditioning and weight\u2010lifting reduced the risk of developing lymphedema. Considerations for Designing an Exercise Program: A number of studies have shown that aerobic and resistance exercises are safe and beneficial for people with lymphedema or at risk of lymphedema if they follow the guidelines for progressing slowly, use recommended compression, and report any adverse effects to a professional who can help them adapt their exercise regimen.9,16\u201021 Most studies on lymphedema and exercise have been done on breast cancer survivors, but the principles may guide exercise in other forms of lymphedema. Individuals with or at risk of lymphedema must report other health conditions that need to be considered in developing a personal exercise regimen (diabetes, heart disease, neuropathy, arthritis, etc). Modifications of aerobic and resistance exercise that are commonly recommended for individuals with lymphedema are: 1) Allowing adequate rest intervals between sets; 2) Avoiding weights that wrap tightly around an extremity or clothing that cause constriction; 3) Wearing compression sleeves or bandages during exercise; 4) Maintaining hydration; 5) Avoiding extreme heat or overheating; 6) Exercising in a circuit that alters the type of exercise and body part within the exercise session. Exercise and Compression Garments: Lymphedema Remedial Exercise as a part of CDT requires compression garments or bandages.3\u20105 There are no studies on the use of compression garments when performing stretching or flexibility exercise alone. The NLN Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) recommends using the guidelines for aerobic and resistance exercise to guide use of compression during flexibility exercise since flexibility exercises may be combined with other forms of exercise. The amount and type of compression for exercise should be decided with input from a professional knowledgeable about lymphedema. There is no strong evidence basis for the use of compression garments during exercise; however, most experts in the field of lymphedema advise the use of compression during vigorous exercise for people with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema. One study suggested that individuals with lymphedema who do resistance exercise without compression may increase swelling.20 Resistance exercise may reduce limb volume when used as an adjunct to compression therapy in people with confirmed lymphedema.8 One study showed that aerobic and weight\u2010lifting exercise was safely performed without compression in women at risk for breast cancer\u2010related lymphedema.9 That study showed patients who developed lymphedema could continue to exercise with compression garments. Compression garments should be measured by an individual trained and experienced in fitting compression garments for lymphedema and should be at least Class I compression for upper extremity. Higher classes may be required for more severe lymphedema and for lower extremity lymphedema. A hand piece (gauntlet or glove) is recommended when exercising with a sleeve to avoid causing or exacerbating hand swelling. Definition of Individuals At Risk for Lymphedema: Individuals at risk for lymphedema have not displayed signs and symptoms of lymphedema but may have sustained damage to their lymphatic systems through surgical lymph node removal or radiation therapy. Additionally, individuals at risk may have surgical incisions in the vicinity of lymph transport vessels. Individuals who have family members with hereditary lymphedema may also be at risk. An individual's risk of lymphedema may change over time depending on factors such as weight gain, age, and changes in medical condition. It is the position of the NLN that:  Exercise is a part of a healthy lifestyle and is essential for effective lymphedema management  Before starting any exercise program, individuals should be cleared for the program of activity by their physician.  Lymphedema Exercises (also known as Remedial Exercises) are specific rhythmic muscle and breathing exercises used as a part of lymphedema treatment in Phase I and Phase II Complete Decongestive Therapy (see the NLN Position Paper on Diagnosis and Treatment). www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntr... In Phase II lymphedema maintenance, these exercises can be combined with or integrated into a regular exercise program.  After intensive treatment with CDT, the person with lymphedema should work with the certified lymphedema therapist or qualified lymphedema specialist provider (MD, NP) to adapt their remedial exercises into their fitness and weight management program at the time they are moving from Phase I (treatment phase) to Phase II (self management).  Individuals with or at risk for lymphedema can and should perform aerobic and resistance exercise in a safe manner.  The individual with or at risk for lymphedema may benefit from working with an Exercise Physiologist and/or Personal Trainer. The person with lymphedema should inquire if the trainer or exercise physiologist has experience working with lymphedema and other medical conditions. Certification for personal trainers varies. Patients who are unsure of about the qualifications of a community exercise practitioner should work with a certified lymphedema therapist or health care provider to assist them in finding a community exercise program or professional.  In general, individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema should utilize compression garments or compression bandages during exercise.  Individuals at risk for lymphedema may or may not utilize compression garments during exercise; this is an individual decision to be made with guidance from a care provider and/or therapist based on risk, activity, and conditioning level.  Individuals at risk for lymphedema will benefit from most forms of exercise tailored to their individual needs.  Individuals at risk for or with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema should avoid repetitive overuse of the affected part. Sudden increase in an individual's usual exercise duration or intensity may trigger or worsen lymphedema. It is likely that a program of slowly progressive exercise for the affected body part will decrease the potential for common daily activities to result in overuse.  Exercise should be started gradually, increased cautiously, and stopped for pain, increased swelling, or discomfort.  The risks of exercise for the individual with or at risk for lymphedema must be balanced against the risks of deconditioning that undoubtedly results from not exercising. A deconditioned body part with or at risk for lymphedema can do progressively less without risk of overuse. As a result, exercise is recommended for those with and at risk for lymphedema.  The NLN cannot specifically determine the safety of exercise for any individual. The guidelines in this Position Paper provide general principles, but do not substitute for medical evaluation and recommendations from a health care professional. It is the responsibility of all individuals with or at risk for lymphedema to consult with their health care provider regarding their own specific needs.

I don't know anything about Michigan, except that I went to college in Ann Arbor, and would expect that there are good neurologists at U of M. At the lectures yesterday, Dr. Anna Towers of McGill, who is head of the Canadian Lymphedema Framework Project, presented on disability after breast cancer surgery. It's very, very high. She found that women would say they weren't disabled, but on closer questioning, they had others take over--partners at home and co-workers at work. She also found a huge impact on employment--women retiring early. I guess in Canada, it takes a year to see a pain specialist. I know that LE can cause pain and clumsiness, but I agree that you should see a neurologist as well. I also know you as a tireless crusader for people with disabilities, and now, we all need to crusade for you, because what's happening in your life is just too much to bear. I agree with MOTC---see the LE therapist to start, and try and get a referral to a good neurologist who takes your insurance.

You might want to review your technique. In MLD, they are trying to actually activate parasympathetic tone: you don't want vasoconstriction of the extremities, and the deep breathing is a vagal stimulator--but you could easily hyperventilate and that could contribute to nausea. I also have a great PT who works with my LMT, and she is concerned about my constantly cool fingers (sympathetic tone) and I also have my issues in my left hand, and she wanted me to visualize holding a warm cup of tea to create a biofeedback to warm my hands. They use that technique for migraines--the biofeedback warming of hands--decreasing sympathetic tone. Part of the reason I get nausea is inner ear problems, so head position may be an issue. Just some random ideas. When in doubt, review it with your therapist if possible. Kira ",

Most often it's breast cellulitis that can stay red, swollen and warm for a long time, but Cookiegal was on levaquin for months and months at one point for an atypical arm cellulitis--or is it? No one ever has figured it out for sure. I do think you should see your oncologist, for reassurance and reassessment. Ideally, a physician who is skilled in lymphedema should see you, but they're few and far between, and there's no speciality in lymphology, so they can come from many fields. Does your lymphedema therapist think it's celllulitis? Here's my personal opinion: when the lymphatics aren't working, there can be a low grade infection, or an inflammatory response that can linger. Kind of like chronic sinusitis--when there's no drainage, the situation can linger.  Personally, when there's a game plan, I feel so much better--so I think it's time to get a plan for this. Kira",

Also, they had to drill into my mandible to get me numb. I asked my husband, who does a lot of endodontics, and he hears about soreness in the area, even with sucessful root canals, in many patients. Just because the nerve is gone, it doesn't mean that there may not be a resolving abscess or some irritation in the bone that gives some residual pain. I'm sure patients feel a whole lot better after the inflammed nerve and/or abscess is gone, but it can still be sore--in my experience. And my root canal and crown were successful and the root canal was completed in one visit, with the temporary crown. But talking to the dentist is a good idea: maybe there was an abscess, or one canal was hard to find--they can do follow up xrays to check the result and examine your tooth for sensitivity and/or infection.

Shortly after surgery in 2008, Cook developed lymphedema in her left arm. The abnormal build-up of fluid in tissue causes swelling - often in the arms or legs, but it can occur anywhere in the body.The arm might feel heavy or achy and swelling is a major symptom, but often the early signs manifest before there is any swelling,\" Cook said. \"The main thing about lymphedema is that the earlier it is treated, the fewer problems there are down the road.\" Lymphedema is a specialized area that is not well understood by some health-care professionals and patients, Gardikiotis said. To educate patients, health-care workers and policy-makers about the chronic condition, the association, in conjunction with the Continuing Physical Therapy Education department at the University of Saskatchewan and the RQHR held a Lymphedema Management Symposium last week that featured experts from the Mayo Clinic, the Toronto area and Montreal. Experts at the symposium strongly promoted exercise and reinforced the importance of using compression garments. Patients diagnosed early often require just a compression garment to contain the swelling, Gardikiotis said. For three years, Cook religiously wore a compression garment, did self massage and had manual lymph drainage - a light progressive massage to encourage drainage. Since September, her arm has improved so she doesn't require a compression garment during the day, but wears a Reid Sleeve nightly and does compression wrapping. Cook lamented that lymphedema treatment across Saskatchewan is spotty and said more specialists are required. There is no cure, but if caught early, the impact can be significantly minimized, Gardikiotis said. \"In the later stage, there is some tissue damage and some of those changes are irreversible and they require much more treatment to maintain their limb at a stable point and minimize infection and keep them functioning,\" Gardikiotis said. \"If not treated properly, it can have significant physical, psychosocial and financial implications on patients' lives so we're really striving to increase lymphedema awareness and education to ensure that we can improve the care that we are offering patients.\" So, as we all know, we all need our tool box, and then we--as my LE therapist says (she of \"whack a mole\" fame)--see what we can get away with.  So, some people just need daytime garments, some need nighttime, and some need both, and some need \"prn\"--as they need it--treatment. But ignorance isn't bliss, it's denial and under treatment. And too bad there's so few therapists in this area of Canada Kira Knowledge is the antidote to fear, Ralph Waldo Emerson Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Yet, it never ceases to upset me.  I only had swelling in my index/middle finger and a month ago, my thumb and pinkie joined in: they're getting better, but ARGHH. I may have caused it (likely) by over-wrapping. I've learned the hard way that sometimes \"less is more\". No mail in a week?? I really hope you get a break soon. My younger daughter traveled to Mississippi to do research Friday, and got stuck in Charlotte (they cancelled her plane possibly before she left, and didn't tell her), and there was a 12-24 hour ordeal where due to cancelled flights, she ended up taking a Greyhound to Atlanta, where it got stranded, at 1 am--and thanks to a nice woman at the airport and a helpful homeless guy at the bus station--she took the train the airport, where the flight I booked at 1 am was cancelled at 2 am, but she did get a flight yesterday, and got to the State Archives  in Jackson, MS, to discover it was closed for the Dixie National Parade! So she got some great southern food and went back to her hotel to crash. She's 21, technically an adult, but still. Her professor was supposed to fly down with his family to present at Ole Miss, and he's stuck in Boston. This weather!  Janet: limbo is the worst! Hoping for nothing but good news.

I find the games soothing to watch. Oh, and your excel program to monitor the arm is a miracle!

Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves  by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist.  Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled. If you go to the page, it has links to the light compression gloves. What horrible timing, to have this act up during a historic blizzard! Kira ",

It's like a little bit pregnant--once you swell, you unfortunately have lymphedema. It can be transient--you can swell once or twice and never swell again, but the tendency is there and the risk is there forever. A good LE therapist can teach you the tools to prevent any progression.  I'm in RI and usually my husband shovels--and he's in Anguilla with a friend (feeling very guilty)--so I hired someone to plow....I'll do the walkways, with sleeve and glove and carefully.

There's a lot of concern with fitters about the all in one garments: on one hand, no trapping of fluid at the wrist, on the other, how do you wash your hands? Thinking of nerves in the hand--that's the median nerve distribution--the old carpal tunnel---so if your wrist is flexed it could be adding to the problem. Bottom line, it's unacceptable, and the fitter needs to both make it right, and get you a sleeve/glove to use while it gets fixed. Compression garments are tough! It's hard to get the right fit, and material, and often it's a trial and error process. Binney seems to have an amazing fitter who tries all sorts of unusual things for her, but Binney has also learned from hard experience to tell them to make modifications to the fit--like looser on her top of her hand to get more compression in the palm. Elvarex is a tough fabric, so a pinch can really hurt. Kira ",

Sheila--here's hoping for a dramatic reduction: I used to wrap just to the elbow and darn if I didn't collect a little pocket behind the elbow: so now I'm the whole arm wrap. But when it's doing well, that's mostly all I need--rare glove/sleeve use. Everyone is different. I did have an episode of pitting edema at my inner wrist two weeks ago after hugging my knees for 6 hours at a meditation retreat. There went my enlightenment....But when it's behaving, my swelling is primarily in my index finger and the web space.  The last two weeks proved to me that with enough provocation, I could swell in other parts of my arm--depressing. I really wish LBBC would publish a transcript of the LE talk by Andrea Cheville--because just for a few moments she discussed the hand. They do have a free podcast you can download. http://www.lbbc.org/transcript-category.asp?transcriptcategory=medical It's halfway down the page. they have instructions at the top: if you click on the webcast, it plays the conference, and you can save it, if you want to.  Kira ",

He did my first one when I was really swollen, and then another tech put on a really tight one two weeks later--and it hurt almost immediately, and I went in, and another not so good cast tech just cut out a window over the tightest spot on my wrist, and I spent a painful weekend and got some swelling at the elbow above it, and went in on the Monday, and demanded the great tech, and that's when he did the super cast. When the cast came off: my hand was swollen and disgusting. And it took time to get my hand back to \"normal\"--but it has pretty much gotten there. My swelling is primarily in my hand, and I don't usually need much day time compression, and I'm back to that point. I do wrap at night. So, in my experience, the cast tech needs to understand your dual need for protection and not to over constrict. After the cast came off, I did OT with a woman trained for LE: and she still didn't get that I couldn't do 40 reps with a 1 lb weight, but she learned, but overall, she was a very good OT. I went to her because she also treats LE. She's not my primary LE therapist who is a LMT. Good luck. It's doable, IMO. Kira",

Vol. 26 No. 3 REVIEW ARTICLE Lymphedema: Separating Fact From Fiction By Sarah A. McLaughlin, MD1 | March 12, 2012 1Department of Surgery, Mayo Clinic Florida, Jacksonville, Florida ABSTRACT: Lymphedema is a feared complication of cancer treatment and one that negatively impacts survivorship. The incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema ranges from 6% to 70%, but lymphedema may be a common and under-reported morbidity. No standard guidelines for its diagnosis and assessment exist. Although the true etiology of lymphedema remains unknown, radiation, chemotherapy, type of breast surgery, and extent of axillary surgery are commonly cited risk factors. However, the relationship between the number of nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema is not clearly correlated. Clinical trials are focusing on ways to reduce the need for axillary dissection even in the setting of a positive sentinel node, to help minimize axillary morbidity. Risk-reduction practices, including avoidance of skin puncture and blood pressures in the ipsilateral upper extremity, and precautionary behaviors such as wearing compression garments during air travel continue to be advocated by the medical and survivor communities, despite a lack of rigorous evidence supporting their benefit. Emerging data support exercise in at-risk and affected women with lymphedema when started gradually and increased cautiously. Introduction Lymphedema in right arm of patient; from Boris M, et al. Oncology. 11:99-109,1997 The most recent survivorship data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database demonstrate a significant increase in the number of US cancer survivors over the last 30 years, from roughly 3 million in 1973 to nearly 12 million in 2008.[1] As a result, issues of survivorship have stimulated new focus for clinical trials, not only to determine the most effective therapeutic regimen (surgery, drug, or radiation) but also to identify the one with the least influence on future quality of life. Lymphedema has long been a feared complication of surgical cancer treatment, and notably one that negatively impacts survivorship. Fear of lymphedema stems from patient concerns regarding the chronic, progressive nature of the condition and the clinician's relative inability to predict or prevent its development. Furthermore, decades of physician and allied health teachings based on opinion and theory have perpetuated the myths shrouding lymphedema risk, prevention, and treatment. A vast body of literature documents the occurrence of breast cancer-related lymphedema, with more than 1400 articles indexed in PubMed-MEDLINE databases alone. Importantly, lymphedema also exists after surgery for non-breast-cancer-related malignancies, but data documenting this occurrence are rare in comparison. Recently, Cormier et al found only 47 studies between 1972 and 2008 with more than 10 patients that prospectively evaluated lymphedema as a primary or secondary outcome after treatment for melanoma, bladder, sarcoma, penile, prostate, vulvar, cervical, endometrial, or head and neck cancers.[2] The authors' analysis of these studies demonstrated the overall incidence of lymphedema to be 16.3% after melanoma, 10.1% after genitourinary cancers, and 19.6% after gynecologic malignancies, and notes that lymphedema rates are higher when the lower rather than upper extremity is affected. Given the abundance of breast cancer data, this review will focus on breast cancer-related lymphedema. However, the principles and controversies discussed are relevant regardless of the type of malignancy to which the lymphedema is attributed. Incidence and Diagnosis The incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema has been difficult to quantify due to delayed onset of symptoms and the lack of standardized diagnostic criteria. A recent meta-analysis reports the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema to range from 0 to 3% after lumpectomy alone to as high as 65% to 70% after modified radical mastectomy (removal of breast and axillary lymph nodes) with regional nodal radiation.[3] Overall, 80% to 90% of women who will develop lymphedema do so within 3 years of treatment,[4,5] but the risk persists years later as the remaining 10% to 20% will develop lymphedema at a rate of 1% per year.[5] Petrek et al followed 263 patients and found that nearly 50% developed lymphedema by 20 years.[5] These data suggest that lymphedema is probably more common than generally reported, and clearly the length of follow-up in a given study influences the reported incidence. A uniform definition of lymphedema does not exist. Although volume displacement methods are considered the gold standard for diagnosis, these methods are cumbersome and unable to identify subclinical lymphedema. Thus, displacement methods are rarely used in clinical settings. Circumferential arm measurements performed with a nonelastic tape measure are commonly used to determine upper extremity size differences. It is essential to obtain baseline preoperative measurements of the ipsilateral and contralateral extremities, as differences of up to 2 cm may naturally exist between the dominant and nondominant arms at baseline.[6] Published literature demonstrates significant heterogeneity, as studies lack agreement on the location and minimal number of measurements performed. Furthermore, they use multiple definitions of what constitutes lymphedema, including measurement changes greater than 2 cm, volume increase of more than 200 mL, or percentage increases in volume (> 10% or > 20%) compared with baseline when controlled for changes in the contralateral arm.[7,8] Aside from objective measurements, some studies define lymphedema by patient subjective symptoms or patient perceptions of swelling. Controversy remains as to whether a measurement change or a patient's perception of swelling should be considered diagnostic. While a measurement change is objective, measurements may be affected by inter-rater and even intra-rater variability affecting reproducibility. Perhaps more importantly, a defined measurement change may be asymptomatic in an obese patient, while a thin woman may be bothered by more subtle measurement changes not meeting measured criteria for lymphedema. Alternatively, a patient's perception of swelling may more accurately diagnose symptomatic lymphedema, but this perception may be influenced by sensory changes from the surgery and additional adjuvant therapies. Further, women with surgery in their dominant arm may perceive functional issues to a greater degree than if it were the nondominant arm that was affected.[9] In fact, one study found only 41% of women with perceived swelling had circumferential arm measurement changes greater than 2 cm, the objective threshold used in the study to define lymphedema.[9] Several contemporary studies have evaluated the differences between measured and perceived lymphedema and have validated patient perceptions against physical therapist-directed measurements.[4,10] These studies conclude that each evaluation method is valid but not interchangeable, and they do not endorse one method over another. The clinical introduction of a single-frequency bioelectrical impedance device manufactured by Impedimed (Mansfield, Australia) can minimize both inter-rater and intra-rater variability seen with other measurement techniques. The device produces easily interpretable values measuring the changes in extracellular fluid when compared with the unaffected contralateral upper extremity. A score increase of 10 or more or one that registers outside the normal range should prompt intervention with a compression garment or a referral for physical therapy. Some investigators report that measurement of bioimpedance has improved sensitivity in detecting subclinical lymphedema up to 4 months prior to standard measurement changes.[11] For these reasons, the current National Lymphedema Network (NLN) breast cancer-related lymphedema guidelines recommend that all breast cancer patients receive pre- and post-treatment measurements (of any type) on both arms and encourage the use of bioimpedance spectroscopy or infrared perometry as alternatives to tape measures, to limit measurement variations.[12] Is It All About the Nodes? Over the years, many retrospective studies have reported risk factors for lymphedema. Axillary node dissection (ALND), mastectomy, obesity, radiation, infection, and ipsilateral upper extremity injury consistently rank as the most influential causes of damage or disruption to the lymphatic system and thus lymphedema. However, the magnitude of association between breast cancer treatment factors and lymphedema is inconsistent across studies.[8] Tsai et al reviewed 98 studies conducted in the United States and Canada through January 2008 for lymphedema risk factors.[8] The authors report a significantly increased risk for lymphedema in women undergoing mastectomy compared with lumpectomy (risk ratio [RR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.76), ALND compared with no dissection (RR, 3.47; CI, 2.34-5.15), ALND compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (RR, 3.07; CI, 2.20-4.29), radiation therapy vs no radiation therapy (RR, 1.92; CI, 1.61-2.28), and positive vs negative axillary lymph nodes (RR, 1.54; CI, 1.32-1.80). While this meta-analysis demonstrates a comprehensive, contemporary review of lymphedema risk factors, the heterogeneity of the data must be considered, as 11 different definitions for lymphedema were used and follow-up ranged between 1 month and 30 years. Though the most intuitively obvious risk factor for lymphedema is the number of nodes removed, the relationship between the number of lymph nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema remains unresolved. Several retrospective studies have shown that the number of nodes removed and the risk of lymphedema do not correlate.[13,14] Others find an increasing risk of lymphedema as more nodes are removed.[15-17] Despite various lengths of follow-up, from 6 to 60 months, the prospective trials vetting SLNB as the standard of care for axillary staging demonstrate significantly reduced rates of lymphedema after SLNB (0 to 7%) compared with ALND (12% to 16%).[18-21] These studies certainly support the concept that the risk of lymphedema is proportional to the extent of axillary surgery. Importantly, though, they also confirm that even with SLNB a small but clear risk of lymphedema remains. A recent study by Goldberg et al suggests that it is not the number of lymph nodes removed but instead the degree of dissection and disruption of the lymphatic system that results in lymphedema.[22] The authors reviewed 600 women having SLNB with a median follow-up of 5 years and found an overall incidence of lymphedema of 5%. When stratifying the data according to the number of nodes removed, they found no significant association between the mean, median, or range of number of nodes excised and lymphedema (P = .93). Furthermore, the authors completed a subset analysis of the women having more than 10 lymph nodes removed at SLNB. None of these women developed lymphedema. Interestingly, when these SLNB patients having > 10 nodes removed were compared with a separate group of women having 10 to 17 nodes removed at ALND, 11% of the ALND patients had measured lymphedema (P = .04). The fact that women having more than 10 nodes removed during SLNB did not develop lymphedema but women with the same number of nodes removed after ALND did reaffirms that the relationship between the nodes removed and lymphedema is complex. Perhaps it is the relative magnitude of lymphatic destruction and individual patient ability to form collateral lymphatic channels, rather than the number of nodes removed, that influences lymphedema risk. For example, a patient with many nodes removed at SLNB and no finding of lymphedema may have more lymphatic collaterals and therefore will have suffered relatively less lymphatic disruption despite a larger than \"normal\" number of SLNs removed. On the other hand, women having ALND and a relatively small number of total nodes excised may have suffered an overall greater degree of lymphatic disruption and therefore develop lymphedema. Unfortunately, the number of nodes within each patient's nodal basin and the patient's ability to protect or form new lymphatic collaterals during or after treatments is unknown. Therefore, simply the number of nodes removed may be insufficient to determine lymphedema risk. If, however, the degree of lymphatic disruption or damage is the key driver of lymphedema risk, then it is plausible that radiation can also act primarily or synergistically to influence lymphedema risk. Axillary radiation alone is not without complications, as these patients can have a 2- to 4.5-fold increase in the risk of lymphedema. A recent meta-analysis by Shah and Vicini finds lymphedema in 9% to 65% of patients after lumpectomy alone (no nodal surgery) and regional nodal radiation and in 58% to 65% of women after mastectomy alone and regional nodal radiation.[3] Additionally, the synergistic effect of surgery and radiation is well documented to result in a 3.5- to 10-fold higher risk of lymphedema when compared with surgery alone.[3,23,24] Finally, accumulating data suggest that chemotherapy may also affect lymphatic destruction. Norman et al found anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens increase the risk of lymphedema.[25] Their prospective review of 631 breast cancer survivors followed for 5 years found an elevated hazard ratio (HR) of 1.46 (95% CI, 1.04-2.04) for lymphedema among breast cancer patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy vs no chemotherapy. This risk persisted after stratifying for stage at diagnosis or number of positive nodes. Furthermore, the authors concluded that treatment combinations involving ALND or chemotherapy resulted in approximately four- to five-fold increases in the HRs for lymphedema (HR, 4.16 [95% CI, 1.32-12.45]for SLNB/chemotherapy/no radiation)compared with no treatment. While further validation of this finding is needed, the concept that chemotherapy independently influences lymphedema risk demonstrates that this risk can be affected not only by locally directed therapies but also by systemic ones.[25] Changes in Surgical Management Changes in the surgical management of the axilla have been instrumental in reducing axillary morbidity, especially lymphedema. SLNB is now the standard of care for axillary staging, as its accuracy, low false-negative rate, and low rate of axillary recurrence have been documented in more than 70 studies. Current research to further minimize morbidity from axillary surgery focuses on reducing the need for completion axillary dissection in the setting of a positive axillary node. The American College of Surgeons (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial published in early 2011 documents the first prospective randomized data showing that at a median of 6 years follow-up, SLNB alone does not result in inferior survival in women with T1 or T2 tumors and one or two positive sentinel nodes who received breast conservation surgery, chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy, and whole breast radiation therapy.[26] In the study, more than 70% of the women with a positive SLNB had no additional positive nodes, suggesting that in select cases SLNB can be both diagnostic and therapeutic. While this trial is viewed as practice-changing, it is important to note that the trial called for standard whole breast radiation but did not standardize the radiation tangents other than to say that third field-directed axillary radiation was forbidden. As a result it is possible that radiation tangents were adjusted higher in node-positive women who were randomized to the SLNB-only arm. If standard radiation tangents cover approximately 30% to 50% of the level I and 25% of the level II axillary nodes,[27] then adjusting the tangents \"higher\" has the intention of covering more nodes than standard. These data are important from the perspective of morbidity, as an adjustment in the tangents may result in increased rates of axillary morbidity above what is seen with standard whole breast tangents and SLNB alone. The radiation ports are currently being evaluated retrospectively. An additional prospective trial, ACOSOG Z1071, is evaluating the validity, accuracy, and false-negative rate of SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women who present with node-positive disease at diagnosis. The investigators hypothesize that SLNB after neoadjuvant chemotherapy will appropriately and reliably stage the axilla and therefore allow elimination of ALND in women converted by neoadjuvant chemotherapy from node-positive to node-negative status. The trial accrued quickly and results are pending. Remaining questions to be answered include that of which women may be able to forgo axillary surgery (SLNB or ALND) altogether. Risk-Reduction Practices As long as axillary surgery and/or radiation remain pillars of breast cancer treatment, lymphedema will remain a potential complication. Risk-reduction practices to further prevent lymphedema after axillary surgery have long been advised. It is here that many of the myths regarding lymphedema risk and prevention arise. The National Lymphedema Network, founded in 1988, seeks to educate and guide patients and healthcare providers about lymphedema and risk-reduction practices for those at risk for and affected by the disorder. The organization publishes guidelines on risk-reducing behaviors and seeks to answer the question of whether behavioral modifications can further limit or reduce lymphedema. The NLN's risk-reduction guidelines were updated in 2011 and continue to carry a disclaimer stating that \"there is little evidence-based literature regarding many of these practices, [therefore] the majority of the recommendations must at this time be based on the knowledge of pathophysiology and decades of clinical experience by experts in the field.\"[12] Although the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) do not publish specific guidelines regarding lymphedema diagnosis, treatment, or prevention, the NCCN and NCI websites for patients both describe and define lymphedema and endorse precautionary behaviors similar to those recommended by the NLN.[28,29] The primary goal of the risk-reducing measures is to prevent overload of the lymphatic system by limiting activities that may increase lymphatic flow, local blood flow, or metabolic waste products in the at-risk or affected limb. The recommended behaviors support activity, medical procedure, and lifestyle modifications. Although the lymphedema risk-reduction strategies promulgated by these national organizations are based on sound physiologic principles, the effect of each recommended measure on preventing lymphedema is unclear, as is the impact on one's quality of life if these measures are followed. Although Boccardo et al documented that increased education and awareness can reduce the incidence of lymphedema,[30] it is also possible that increased education can influence patient anxiety. One study reviewed factors affecting patients' intention to avoid strenuous activity by following 175 women for a median of 10 months after axillary surgery. The authors found women given advice on arm care and those with perceived vulnerability regarding, and fear of, lymphedema were more likely to avoid using their arm (odds ratio [OR], 4.9; 95% CI, 1.73-14.06; P = .003; and OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.18-2.16, P = .003, respectively). Interestingly, however, the extent of axillary surgery did not influence the women's arm use (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.56-3.11; P = .52).[31] Several additional inconsistencies exist regarding risk-reduction behaviors. First, standardized advice does not meet the needs of all patients, especially given that the recommendations do not always differentiate between at-risk and affected individuals. Second, there is inconsistent application of the practices across disease sites. While these recommendations are frequently discussed in relation to breast cancer treatment, they are rarely discussed within the context of other malignancies that require lymph node assessment or treatment. Further, many additional patients annually undergo lymph node excision for diagnosis of lymphoma or infection. Ironically, they leave the hospital without having discussed future lymphedema risk with their physicians, despite having a number of lymph nodes removed that is comparable to that of a patient undergoing SLNB for breast cancer. Third, there is still debate over what constitutes a risk-reducing practice. Patients recognize these controversies, given that they frequently receive inadequate or conflicting advice regarding arm care.[31] TABLE 1 Summary of Frequently Recommended Precautionary Behaviors Corresponding to Theoretical Risk Factors and Supporting or Refuting Evidence Despite these inconsistencies, breast cancer survivors have adopted many of the existing lymphedema risk-reducing practices. A prospective study of nearly 1000 breast cancer survivors found that patients having ALND practice a mean of 5.1 risk-reducing behaviors, while those having SLNB follow 4.3.[9] Although this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001), one could argue that it is not clinically significant. For example, more than 98% of women who have undergone ALND avoid blood pressures, intravenous catheter placement, and needle sticks in the ipsilateral arm, while more than 80% of SLNB patients do the same without documented benefit and theoretically less risk than those having ALND. Examination of the recommended risk-reducing behaviors reveals few objective data for or against each measure. The data regarding commonly considered precautionary behaviors are summarized in Table 1. An in-depth review of the role of compression garments when flying, and of IV placement, needle sticks, blood pressures, and exercise, follows. The physiologic theory supporting the role of compression garments during air travel stems from the low cabin pressure that exists during flight, which causes a decrease in extracellular fluid pressure. This pressure decrease facilitates escape of fluid and proteins from the lymphatic vasculature, resulting in lymphedema. A literature review finds only a single retrospective survey-based study of patients with lymphedema published more than 15 years ago, in which 27 of 490 (5.5%) patients surveyed link the onset or worsening of their lymphedema to an airplane flight. The authors of this study cited lowered cabin pressure as the cause but do note the lack of direct evidence.[32] Based on this report and its suggested physiologic premise, at-risk and affected patients are recommended to wear a compression garment, to help regulate the extracellular pressure and support the lymphatic musculature maintaining lymphatic flow.[12] Limited contemporary data, however, do not appear to support these findings or the use of compression garments. Graham et al retrospectively surveyed 287 at-risk survivors regarding air travel.[33] Overall, 50% of them traveled a mean of five flights, and of this group 86% practiced precautionary behaviors consisting of routine use of compression garments with or without other behaviors. The authors observed no difference in lymphedema rates between fliers and nonfliers (P = .42), but interestingly they found the practice of precautionary behaviors to be associated with an increased risk of lymphedema (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.2-20.8; P < .04) among those flying. Furthermore, when analyzed independently, the use of compression garments appeared not to correlate with other suspected lymphedema risk factors, including nodal disease, number of nodes removed, or radiation. They concluded that garments were not necessary and might be counterproductive.[32] Kilbreath et al drew similar conclusions after they prospectively evaluated 72 women preflight and 6 weeks after planned international or transcontinental air travel. Bioimpedance analysis in one study found no difference in extracellular fluid content between baseline and follow-up, regardless of flight distance or compression garment use. Despite their short follow-up and the fact that the women followed were athletes (which may have a protective effect), the authors concluded that air travel did not cause lymphedema.[34] Another long-supported myth regarding prevention of lymphedema is the avoidance of IV catheters or needle sticks. The theory behind this practice arises from the possible risk of infection produced by accidental and nonaccidental skin punctures and is less concerned with the actual puncture itself. Infection will cause an intense inflammatory response, altering the extremity fluid homeostasis. Despite the longevity of this landmark recommendation, a review of the literature finds only one article supporting the practice. Clark et al prospectively followed 188 women for lymphedema and measured them at baseline, 6 months, and 3 years after axillary surgery. At 3 years, patients were also questioned about skin punctures. Overall, 39 (21%) had lymphedema at 3 years.[35] Among other risk factors, univariate analysis found skin puncture for IV catheter insertion, venipuncture for blood draw, or finger stick for blood glucose testing were associated with a significant increased risk for lymphedema, with a risk ratio of 2.44 (95% CI, 1.33-4.47). These data should be interpreted cautiously; 18 of 188 (9.5%) reported remembering any type of skin puncture, and of these 18 women only 8 had lymphedema at the 3-year follow-up. Patients with lymphedema may be more likely to recall previous skin puncture than those without symptoms. Hand surgery ipsilateral to the side of prior axillary surgery could be considered a severe form of skin puncture, lending relevance to the IV and venipuncture question. A small number of studies in the hand surgery literature address this occurrence. Dawson et al reported on 15 women undergoing carpel tunnel release ipsilateral to the side of prior axillary dissection; none had a post-hand surgery infection, new onset of lymphedema, or worsening of existing lymphedema symptoms.[36] In a second series, Hershko and Stahl retrospectively reviewed all hand surgeries performed between 1983 and 2002 and identified only 25 women with 1-year follow-up, of whom 4 had lymphedema at the time of hand surgery and 21 did not. Lymphedema was determined by patient perception only and noted to be worse after surgery in 2 women, each of whom had pre-existing lymphedema. The authors noted no progression or new symptoms in the remaining 23 women. Interestingly, they did not use preoperative antibiotics on any patient, performed 24 of 25 surgeries under local anesthesia, and used a tourniquet in all cases.[37] Gharbaoui et al surveyed the members of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.[38] Among the 606 surgeons returning the surveys, more than 95% said they have willingly performed hand surgery on patients with a history of ipsilateral lymphadenectomy, radiation, or both. Surgeon willingness to operate decreases if lymphedema is present but remains quite high at 85%. Overall, 94% and 74% of surgeons routinely use tourniquets in women without and with lymphedema, respectively. Surgeon recollection identified fewer complications of infection, lymphedema, or delayed wound healing among patients without lymphedema (3% vs 23%). These three studies offer marginal data and anecdotal reports at best about the safety of ipsilateral skin puncture as they are all retrospective with small numbers, are fraught with recall bias, and lack any objective measurements. Despite this, each study calls for re-evaluation of the skin puncture guidelines as they relate to lymphedema risk. Perhaps the authors should also conclude that re-evaluation of the ipsilateral blood pressure guidelines is warranted, as their data demonstrated a clear willingness to use tourniquets with minimal reported morbidity. No documented studies to date have reviewed the recommendation to avoid ipsilateral blood pressure measurements. Clearly, these conclusions must be interpreted with caution, and further study is warranted. While the recommendations to wear compression garments while flying, and to avoid IV sticks, venipuncture, and blood pressures are made with good intention and based on sound physiologic principles, few rigorous data support them. Unfortunately, though, without good scientific data supporting or refuting these practices, both clinicians and patients are still faced with the clinical dilemma of whether or not they should encourage or disregard these behaviors. Finally, exercise has historically been discouraged for breast cancer survivors, based on the belief that it would increase metabolic waste and extracellular fluid accumulation in the extremity, causing lymphedema. Over the last 5 years, the recommendation to avoid exercise has been challenged. Aside from recommended flexibility and remedial exercises used to reduce arm swelling and promote mobility during lymphedema treatment, exercise consists of resistance exercises (weight lifting), aerobic exercise, or a combination of both. Robust data support the value of resistance exercise in both at-risk and affected women. In fact, five of six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2006 and 2010 found weight lifting to be associated with minimal risk of developing or exacerbating lymphedema.[39] The largest study with the longest follow-up is the physical activity and lymphedema trial (PAL) that followed 141 women with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Patients were randomized to either weight training while wearing a compression sleeve, which was supervised twice weekly, or to a control group who were asked not to alter their exercise level. At 1-year follow-up, the authors found no increase in lymphedema in the intervention group and, further, found fewer and less severe lymphedema exacerbations in the weight training group.[40] The follow-up study evaluating weight training in at-risk survivors also found no difference in lymphedema rates between the two groups but interestingly found that among women with more than five nodes removed, those in the weight training group were significantly less likely to develop lymphedema than those in the control group (7% vs 22%, P = .003).[41] Based on these data, the NLN now supports the safety of resistance exercises in a controlled manner, starting with small weights, low repetition, and gradual progression.[12] In general, compression garments should be worn during exercise in women with lymphedema and considered on an individual basis for women at risk for lymphedema. A recent meta-analysis reviewed seven studies evaluating aerobic exercise in people with lymphedema.[39] Among the three randomized controlled trials and the four literature reviews, aerobic exercise or the combination of resistance and aerobic exercise did not trigger lymphedema or increase its incidence. Despite the relative agreement between the studies, the meta-analysis cautions that the benefits of aerobic exercise should be weighed against potential harms, as the data were not robust. Specifically, only one of three RCTs had more than 50 patients, but it was hampered by a trial adherence rate of only 70%.[42] Although aerobic exercises appear safe, additional well-designed studies with larger numbers and longer follow-up are needed. Conclusions As long as evaluation and treatment of the axilla are necessary, lymphedema will continue to be a potential morbidity. It is hoped that the move towards personalized medicine, by individualizing surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy regimens, will help to reduce the incidence of treatment morbidities, including lymphedema. Until the risk of lymphedema is eliminated, however, risk-reduction practices will remain a consideration for all breast cancer survivors. Clinicians should recognize that patients are not at equal risk for lymphedema and that data do not support a standardized approach nor allow for complete disregard of risk-reduction behaviors. Exercise in a monitored fashion is likely to be safe in all survivors, and the recommendation not to exercise appears to be the only myth surrounding lymphedema that has been scientifically disproven.",

To qualify for brachytherapy which is quite expensive, you need to have a low grade tumor and a breast and depth to handle the device. Last year there was a review of brachytherapy in Medicare patients and cosmesis was not good, and I think there were more subsequent mastectomies. I need to re read it. I couldn't have had brachytherapy due to smaller breast size. Ah, here it is on bc.org--brachytherapy causes more complications/mastecomies in older women (they used medicare data--so they just looked at older women) www.breastcancer.org/treatment... When I worked for the rad onc, there was one breast surgeon who pushed brachytherapy on practically all his patients, and one was a high risk triple negative person, who did not meet guidelines, and she relapsed within months. Other women had terrible scars and hematomas. And the one week business--it's more like 2 weeks as you have surgery, get the device put in a few days later, start on a subsequent Monday-Friday, have to wait a few days for the incision to heal after the device is out, and then they could shower. Due to the open wound/device, everyone is on antibiotics. But, in two weeks or so, you're done.... Hypothetically, and for the right person, it would totally spare the nodes. It just delivers radiation to the surgical cavity.",

It has NOT become standard of care, unfortunately. She specifically addressed radiaition to node negative women: \"In an effort to deliver therapeutic doses of radiation to the breast, lymph nodes under the arm are innocent bystanders that often are irrevocably harmed. Minimizing harm to these nodes during breast cancer treatment is the most effective way we have seen to reduce women's risk of developing lymphedema,\" says the study's lead investigator, Andrea Cheville, M.D., a consultant in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in lymphedema management.   Also, radiation is planned on a CT, and the tangents can be modified. www.mayoclinic.org/news2010-rs... And, position can make a difference: the prone position gets less lung/heart/nodes. Guidelines for radiation are not prescribed, ASTRO does studies and makes recommendations, but it comes down to the individual rad onc, and the global standard of care is not to shield the axilla--at this time. But, I feel, women should know that their axillary nodes are being irradiated, not JUST the breast. As well as their hearts and lungs. Informed consent should include the details, IMO--mine was like \"radiation can make you tired, irritate your skin and lower your blood count\" No details at all.",

And it doesn't take much to bring it on. But for those of us who had whole breast radiation, I personally was never informed that most of my axillary nodes were getting radiated and I told the rad onc I'd gotten LE right after surgery and before rads.  If I knew then, what I know now, I would have asked her to minimize the amount of radiation delivered to my negative node axilla.  Informed consent means to really inform the patient. I would have liked to know about the axillary radiation, the benefits and the risks, and the rad onc not to lie and say that radiation to the nodes never causes LE. Seriously misinformed/uninformed. Carol, my MIL was offered a lumpectomy, in the Bernie Fisher trial in Pittsburgh, and declined due to fear of rads. She was a 40+ year survivor, but with LE. I saw some impressive radiation pulmonary fibrosis during my time with the rad onc.... I truly just assumed it was just my breast getting radiated. Knowing how much of the axilla gets radiated, it makes my think of the Guiliano trial, where 1-2 positive nodes and a T2 tumor did just as well with SNB without ALND. They had \"standard\" treatment--and many likely got a good dose of radiation to the axilla. I need to look at the trial again.",

Too bad many major breast centers adopt the party line \"none of our patients get LE!\" In Boston: Dana Farber/Brigham and Womens have taken the approach that LE is a reportable diagnosis=error, while Mass General has a protocol to measure all women with the perometer pre-op and at all post-op visits, with early referral to LE therapy. Wouldn't it be nice if the second approach was the norm? I think any surgeon who does a breast fellowship should have an obligation to be trained in LE, but that's just my vote. There are few rehab doctors around--but in Canada, Anna Tower, the head of LE at McGill, is a family doctor who took a LE training course and became the head of LE.

All the procedures should be done by needles, so you run a risk of infection, and yes, they can make the area swell--so avoid pain (pain causes swelling)--take whatever pain meds you're allowed to take, avoid heat extremes--but if a cool compress helps, feel free to apply it.  Binney often suggests an underarmour shirt, slightly too small, turned inside out--so the seams don't chafe you for arm and chest compressiion. You're right, poorly fitting compression is not helpful. I hope that the lung nodules are nothing serious, and that aspirating the cysts gives you relief, and I'm going to ask Binney for her expert advice.

I found this paragraph interesting: We also found that 12 of the 18 women who developed secondary lymphoedema had axillary web syndrome during the second and third week after surgery. The axillary web syndrome is a known but poorly studied complication of surgery.54 61 62 No study has shown any link between the axillary web syndrome and the onset of secondary lymphoedema. We and others32 50 suggest that the axillary web syndrome may be a sign of injury to the lymphatic system and it could produce a lymphatic overload as a result of failure of the lymphatic system. This overload, together with other factors, could be responsible for the onset of secondary lymphoedema. When axillary web syndrome was diagnosed in the postoperative period in the intervention group, specific manual lymph drainage strokes were applied, together with progressive active and action assisted shoulder and arm exercises. Manual lymph drainage acted on the pain and inflexibility inherent to the vascular inflammation of the lymphatic vessel; also, if the axillary web syndrome did produce a lymphatic overload, and therefore a possible subclinical oedema, the action of the manual lymph drainage could help with reabsorption.32 34 59 60 63 Further research on a possible relation between the axillary web syndrome and the development of secondary lymphoedema in women after breast cancer surgery is needed. I just knew, with the many cords I had, that my lymphatic system was not working well at all. I do wish, having seen the PT--that someone would have given me the NLN risk reductions--maybe I wouldn't have gone out in 90 degree heat and gotten bug bite/poison ivy. I was seeing PT and the LMT's at the hospital LE clinic--but they did not provide the kind of comprehensive services that were provided in this study, but if the vast majority of women with significant axillary web got LE, makes you wonder if it would have made a difference.

My arm was in lousy shape from the flight/hotel/food--so I put on the solaris Tribute at the airport and wrapped the hand/forearm, before the flight, and flew 2 hours and left it on for an hour afterward, and it was in pretty good shape.  I have a handout from jovipak from the NLN, and it states that jovipak is always meant to be an undergarment.

My gyn keeps telling me that despite my age-53--if I still have periods on tamoxifen, I need to consider that I could get pregnant--cut me a break!  I've always heard that 1/3 have regular periods on it, 1/3 have irregular and 1/3 have none.

Some sleeves deliberately lower the wrist compression so if a glove/gauntlet is layered over it, you don't have double compression. Here's the link to why hand protection is important lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gau... On the stepup site there are stories of poorly fitting garments and fitters who just dispensed that they had, not what fit. What could help is 1) an opinion from your LE therapist 2) know your measurements, so you can compare them against the size chart (you can find that on any online lymphedema garment site, like lymphadema products) Some brands are more \"forgiving\": like they give a range, while Juzo tends to give absolute numbers. I have a Juzo sleeve and a medi 95 sleeve (on Otter's advice) and both work fine for me, although I don't wear them much--except exercising, so I don't wear them much.... The compression is graduated: more at the wrist and less as you go up the arm--but it's really important that the arm goes high enough (I order a long, and the Juzo long is not as long as the medi long). It sounds like maybe the sleeve is too short and trapping fluid in the upper arm. Good luck. Kira",

Being told nothing is wrong is the default position of so many of our health care providers: we call that \"denying our reality\" I think that a GOOD LE therapist could help you, and I've found that quality varies, but a good one, is worth their weight in gold If you have swelling and pain, then you're not in ideal control, and the longer the high protein fluid stays in the tissue, the more inflammation and fibrosis we get, and it's harder to get back to \"normal\". I know it can be difficult, expensive, time consuming, but I'd recommend another try with a LE therapist: here's a link on how to find therapists, and consider interviewing them before making an appointment. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... Seriously, most physicians don't get any education on LE: I recently spoke to a room of gyn oncologists and breast surgeons and none of them knew how to treat LE. And they work with a fully staffed LE clinic in the building, so a referral is their job, and knowing anything about the condition just isn't a high priority. We wrote this to health care providers: www.stepup-speakout.org/essent... When my amazing dog died in 1990, I knew she was sick with bladder cancer, and took home a shepherd puppy--a co-worker who knew my dog was sick was pushing me to take her-- the next day--and it was a huge mistake. The shepherd was inbred and had terrible hips and hated being touched, but we had her for 14 years, and my daughters loved her. When she died, I told them we were going to wait, and my older daughter was on petfinders.com and a week later, I'm driving to a rescue and we got my avatar, a half shepherd/half aussie who is a love. She turns 8 this weekend. The daughter who found her, left for college two weeks later, and is convinced she raised her, but in reality, it was her younger sister who did the heavy lifting and literally had her homework eaten by the dog... You are fit and strong and you deserve a good evaluation. IMO. Kira",

STAR certification (TM) was created by Julie Silver MD, a Harvard based rehab doctor who had breast cancer about a decade ago, in her ?30's, and she wrote a couple of books about it, essentially stopped doing clinical medicine, works at Harvard as a book editor and sells her on-line oncology rehab course. I actually had the opportunity to take the course, through a grant, and I found it interesting, and it will hopefully raise awareness about the long term needs of survivors. Although LE was mentioned frequently, the module on LE had a fair number of mistakes in it. So, I'm STAR certified, for what it's worth. The grant I was on is to encourage members of a breast health center to all become STAR certified, it's written for all levels of health care providers--OT/PT/MD/RN. She markets it as Oncology Rehab  www.oncrehab.com/ It sounds like you have a lot of potential therapists to chose from--and the STAR program does make PT's who aren't trained in LE aware of it and the issues that cancer survivors face. Our dogs are so important, and looking at Deja's kind face, I imagine you miss her a lot. I drove home with my aussie mix, and called my dh to google australian shepherds and he called back and said \"high energy, can be nervous\". Yep. So smart. Kira",

We've had women write here that Livestrong, aerobics class, weight lifting have all triggered their swelling. I wear my glove when I ride my exercise bike (recumbent) and when I take the dog for a walk--and I used to take Tai Chi and I wore the glove. I used to take yoga from a PT, at a community school class, and she was amazing about adapting poses and being realistic. She retired from teaching yoga to care for her 90 year old parents..Then I took from this well trained, but humorless woman, and that's when a pose triggered vertigo. Just FYI: my mother has a liver transplant due to years of hepatitis C. She was a yoga practitioner, and did \"the plow\", and the next day she had an esophageal hemorrhage.

I'm feeling so out of shape and disgusted at my lack of exercise. Before bc I played tennis three times a week, and the obligation got me out there. Now, I spend more time wrapping than exercising...

There are a few women on this board who got lymphedema on their prophylactic side, with no nodes removed. So, while the risk is low, it's not zero, and if you want to prevent it, you should learn about prevention behaviors. www.stepup-speakout.org/riskre...  Kira  Here is an image of the lymphatic system--if you look at it, you'll see how many nodes are in the breast http://www.thymate.com/anatomy/lymsypic.html",

I haven't tried the harness, but I'd much prefer it. My current dog is half aussie/half shepherd, and really is pretty good on the leash, but she's almost 8 now. She's so darn smart--I'm sure she wishes she lived with an owner who would challenge her more. I'm a big dog person too, but my daughter adopted a \"sato\" dog from Puerto Rico, and she is 13 lb of attitude: big dog attitude. We watch her when they go away, and she doesn't have that small dog mentality. She looks like a mini-English setter. I can't seem to make the photo smaller--but as you can see, my dog wears a choke collar--which I hate--and rarely put on her. I think she'd do much better in a harness.

Check this out: I went to get you a link, and the off the shelf jovi sleeve from lymphademaproducts came up, and they state the compression of the jovipak sleeve--around 12-14mm and adds 7mm with an over sleeve: www.lymphedemaproducts.com/pro... Here's the youTube on the combi--no mention of the amount of compression, it's not recommended for night time, and the jacket is sewn into the arm sleeve www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvPFng... You know I've been bugging Solaris about addressing hand swelling, and so far, I haven't gotten anywhere new, but they've been pleasant about it. I do know they would want to out do their competition....So, let's keep trying. I checked on lymphademaproducts and they say they compression of the Solaris=N/A--yet it always gets to me that the sewing of the caresia glove is far better than the finger to axilla one piece. Go figure. Kira--no wonder the open fingered jovipak glove didn't compress my fingers.....Nice sewing, poor results",

Another hint: I kneel next to the bed to wrap, because I can use the side of the bed to maintain the roll, and there's no dropping them. Another position is to sit at a table and wrap with the arm on the table. I've had therapists trap fluid in my hand--ARGHH. I felt like Minnie Mouse, only with five fingers. It's an art, and less is more, and it's nothing any of us wanted to learn, but once we learn it, we have the tools we need to manage this problem.

Sure, we talked garments and MLD, but exercise feels more proactive and in control. No I didn't tell her to go hog wild: essentially I tried to cut and paste what Carol wrote. A 45 mile bikeride was something I could do a long time ago, but I'll try some rides soon. Not just on the stationary recumbent, watching Animal Planet.... Kira",

With the necrotic tissue and the damaged lymphatics, your body is a set up for cellulitis (skin infection)--damaged circulatory system means the antibiotics don't get to the area as well, damaged lymphatics means that the bacteria don't leave as well, and necrotic tissue is a place where an infection can start. Once your infection is gone, treating the LE is key to preventing cellulitis. I hope the next week of levaquin gets rid of it. Here's the page on cellulitis on the stepupspeakout site http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm A piece of advice, the article on cellulitis on that page was written by someone who has congenital lymphedema, and it can be scary to read. Basically it says, treat it fast and effectively and bacteria hide in fibrotic tissue. Hoping you're all better soon. Kira ",

I think about how long you struggled with an atypical cellulitis and I look at the basic premise of prolotherapy which is to inject irritating substances to create an inflammatory response, and how there's little in the literature, and most claims are on the practitioners' websites. I know you are one smart cookie, and you will do this with thought and care and careful observation. And, perhaps in this situation, less is more--the less you inject, the more you can assess the reaction. And report back to us, okay? Kira",

Also, the lymphoderm lotion has all sorts of fragrences in it, and I'm allergic to them, so I use vanicream.

I have a great LANA certified massage therapist, but just got the brush off by my PT LE therapist, who was a 50 mile drive away--and started off good but then got very odd. I'll attest to the difference a good therapist makes. I recently met a PT who seems nice and well trained, and will give her a call--and she's in the same area where I live. I'm so glad you're better and I have to second your observation that way too many doctors don't know or are willing to recognize LE. From a major oncology text: \"Therapeutic nihilism (i.e. no treatment at all) is deplorable, although common. The fact that the average clinician is ill prepared to recognize early stages of lymphedema must be remedied, because the sooner the treatment is started, the less treatment is required to prevent further progression.\"  Cheering for Ellen here.

When I'm better about regular exercising, my LE is better--all that deep breathing. I helped Binney and Jane and others with the stepupspeakout site, and I'm glad it's helped you. Binney just put a section in about bike riding. I don't know if you saw that Nordy just completed a 100 mile bike ride--and MOTC is always running marathons, and Bomber/Deb hasn't posted for a while but she's always out there doing something--you will not be a couch potato. You'll just figure out what you have to do to manage the LE. I gave up tennis: I'm left handed and it's in my left hand, and as I'm not a natural athlete, I always had tennis elbow. As I gain more confidence about managing my LE, and notice how much better I feel after exercise, I'm figuring out more of what I can do. As you noticed, the medical literature on cording is brief series: and the dogma was that cording is not linked to LE. The first time I saw that it was considered a risk factor was in the International Best Practices Guideline, and then the BMJ study on early PT was fairly compelling: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/essential%20informat%20for%20healthcare%20providers.htm ---Axillary Web Syndrome is a risk factor for lymphedema: In a study of early PT to minimize lymphedema, a subset of patients who developed axillary web syndrome at 3-4 weeks post-op had an almost universal development of lymphedema, despite intervention http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068255 BMJ. 2010; 340: b5396. Published online 2010 January 12. \"We also found that 12 of the 18 women who developed secondary lymphoedema had axillary web syndrome during the second and third week after surgery. The axillary web syndrome is a known but poorly studied complication of surgery. No study has shown any link between the axillary web syndrome and the onset of secondary lymphoedema. We and others suggest that the axillary web syndrome may be a sign of injury to the lymphatic system and it could produce a lymphatic overload as a result of failure of the lymphatic system. This overload, together with other factors, could be responsible for the onset of secondary lymphoedema\" It's funny that you mention border collies: I have a half aussie (my avatar: mom was a shepherd) and she has border collie mentality about the ball and chasing, and I always said I loved tennis because it brought out the border collie in me: chase the ball. Do what you love, and the LE makes it more complicated, but shouldn't keep you from being the outfielder. Kira",

The bend of the elbow can be tough. I was just talking to my LE therapist about another therapist's wrapping that was so tight it made me ill, and she doesn't ascribe to that theory. She creates more pressure through more layers. Her argument is that the superficial lymphatics are delicate and near the surface of the skin, and pain is a sign that they could be being harmed.

Here's the blurb on the page: The Advance Armsleeve was developed by Sigvaris with the help of patients and clinicians to create a garment that meets medical efficacy standards and exceeds expectations. Compression garments have long been used in the treatment of lymphedema, but in the past, patients struggled with compliance due to lack of comfort and improper fit. With comfort in mind, the Sigvaris research and development team has created a new product that ensures compliance and patient comfort. In fact, it's already been very well received in other countries around the world. The Advance Armsleeve combines the latest fabric technologies with a breathable top band for enhanced comfort making it a leading treatment choice for patients with lymphedema worldwide. The Advance Armsleeve features: (1) a Sensinnov® grip-top to help keep the armsleeve in place without damaging the fragile skin of the upper arm; (2) thermal control & moisture-wicking properties to enhance comfort for year round wear; (3) silver ions to help maintain skin hygiene; (4) availablility in Regular and Long lengths; (5) a Plus size option for the upper mid-arm http://www.lymphedemaproducts.com/products/sigvaris-sleeve-advance-cg.html?utm_source=Lymphedema+Products+Customer+List&utm_campaign=8ac750a383-LP+Sigvaris+Advance+Announcement+2013-01-17&utm_medium=email Knowledge is the antidote to fear, Ralph Waldo Emerson Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

When all the people were on it during the anthrax scare, lots of them had nightmares, etc. Not to put ideas into your head to scare you more, but being on that class of drugs can make you emotional. Please realize that you are dealing with so much at once, and it doesn't seem like your health care team is supporting you in a way that makes you feel secure. I work in health care, and used to dread the patient with a list--but I've become that patient. I bring in a list and hand it over, so I can be sure all points are mentioned. Bringing in another person helps as well. Medicine is a rushed business, but your questions have to be answered. And you can always call back and say you forgot to ask something. If I were you, I'd avoid the shaving while you're in the midst of an infection--why risk any skin irritation. There's a whole thread on shaving, and many of us have trouble with the electric razors. The hang nail--just moisture it, and you can put some bacitracin ointment on it as well. I wouldn't worry about the ultrasound tech's pressure--if it was going to cause swelling, it did already, and with the infection and seroma, you're going to be swollen. I know how it feels to feel abandoned, alone, scared---and I work in health care, so I know a bit more than someone who doesn't, but that didn't give me a pass on being upset and scared when things happened to my body and I didn't feel supported by my surgeon. I hope the red breast and the fever are responding to the cipro (and I'd also expect a bit of emotional upset, just from the drug and the illness) and I hope you're due to see your surgeon soon: with a LIST. And, I'd tell them to refer you to a LE clinic. Not ask. Don't kick yourself, you are doing the best you can. Kira ",

Right now, I'm wrapped, and it's bulky, but no pain. But, when there is fluid trapped in tissues, it hurts, and the arthritis hurts also. If the finger wrap through the web space on the pinkie hurts, then I'd tell her, and skip it. An ideal wrap is a pressure gradient: more at the hand and less at the top--to drive the fluid up. Many people do incredibly well with night garments, and they sure are easy and comfy. I have both a Solaris and a jovipak and because they just don't do enough for my hand, I wrap a lot, but use the Solaris for a break and a change, and it sure is nice to just slide it on and slide it off. I think the general idea of wrapping for maintenance is the same--I never had the intensive CDT--but likely there is a bit more pressure in these first therapeutic wraps. I think if your hand swells more with compression, that the bandage is driving some excess fluid up, and it's good to mobilize fluid, but it would be ideal if it didn't go into the hand. If you squeeze the bandages, hopefully they feel the most dense at the hand and the least at the upper arm. I completely agree with you about therapists who wear a bandage for a few hours. My LE therapist has LE in her legs, and her SIL has severe LE in her legs after melanoma surgery, and she worked at an in patient clinic in NYC with some of the big names in LE, so she gets it. The first therapist who wrapped me too tight actually said something like \"Some days I'm just horrible at putting on bandages:--what??? So, I vote for mild to moderate pressure without pain. I hope Binney comes along--she really is the expert. Kira ",

Therapeutic exercise? And getting you compression garments? We need all our tools to manage this. While you are looking for the second opinion, you might want to contact her and let her know that your hand is acting up. MLD is the least proven modality in LE treatment, because we all do it differently. Compression garments are proven, wrapping is proven. There are light compression  gloves from isotoner, and we have links to them on the stepupspeakout website. Good luck Kira",

Some therapists would rather have you clear the trunk/neck than work on your arm. I say, you do what you can do, and ideally clear the neck, pump the axillary area, and clear across the top of the chest, and the inguinals--it really doesn't take long. But as Konakat says, even a short version can help. You can wear a glove without a sleeve--you don't want to do the reverse, because you can trap fluid in the hand. I wrap every night, and it no longer bothers me--but if my jovi or solaris did the job for my hand, I'd toss the wraps in a drawer. It is physically and psychologically hard. My LE therapist taught me how to wrap, by kneeling next to the bed and using the bed in a way so the wraps don't go flying. She also has women sit next to a table and use the table. After a year, I don't mind the wrap--I don't LIKE it, but it is comfortable and it works. But, the good news is that there are night garments, and they are easy, and comfortable. Kira",

Perhaps she'll teach you to wrap early in the process so you can take a shower. But the vet sleeve is a great idea. I hate not being able to wash my hands.  I wrap nightly, and recently I had a flare and my LE therapist had to gently do a remedial wrapping session, and teach me again that too much pressure is a bad thing. It's a long term relationship and you have to feel comfortable with the person. I have an LMT who has been with me from the start, and she keeps making me make PT appointments, and I've met some doozies: set your goals! Try, get my LE under control. 150 sleeves for $25 dollars seems reasonable. I used to watch the horse vets put them on and probe all sorts of unmentionable places. Hang in there.

Abstract Context Immunochemical staining of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and bone marrow identifies breast cancer metastases not seen with routine pathological or clinical examination. Objective To determine the association between survival and metastases detected by immunochemical staining of SLNs and bone marrow specimens from patients with early-stage breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients From May 1999 to May 2003, 126 sites in the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0010 trial enrolled women with clinical T1 to T2N0M0 invasive breast carcinoma in a prospective observational study. Interventions All 5210 patients underwent breast-conserving surgery and SLN dissection. Bone marrow aspiration at the time of operation was initially optional and subsequently mandatory (March 2001). Sentinel lymph node specimens (hematoxylin-eosin negative) and bone marrow specimens were sent to a central laboratory for immunochemical staining; treating clinicians were blinded to results. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival (primary end point) and disease-free survival (a secondary end point). Results Of 5119 SLN specimens (98.3%), 3904 (76.3%) were tumor-negative by hematoxylin-eosin staining. Of 3326 SLN specimens examined by immunohistochemistry, 349 (10.5%) were positive for tumor. Of 3413 bone marrow specimens examined by immunocytochemistry, 104 (3.0%) were positive for tumors. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (through April 2010), 435 patients had died and 376 had disease recurrence. Immunohistochemical evidence of SLN metastases was not significantly associated with overall survival (5-year rates: 95.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 95.0%-96.5% for immunohistochemical negative and 95.1%; 95% CI, 92.7%-97.5% for immunohistochemical positive disease; P = .64; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.90; 95% CI, 0.59-1.39; P = .64). Bone marrow metastases were associated with decreased overall survival (unadjusted HR for mortality, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.02-3.67; P = .04), but neither immunohistochemical evidence of tumor in SLNs (adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.45-1.71; P = .70) nor immunocytochemical evidence of tumor in bone marrow (adjusted HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.79-4.26; P = .15) was statistically significant on multivariable analysis. Conclusion Among women receiving breast-conserving therapy and SLN dissection, immunohistochemical evidence of SLN metastasis was not associated with overall survival over a median of 6.3 years, whereas occult bone marrow metastasis, although rare, was associated with decreased survival.

I had a seroma localized to my arm pit, and it wasn't drained until after radiation, and the remnants of it linger, and it was a lot smaller. The International Best Practices guideline link seroma with lymphedema. But, more serious is infection--it's strongly linked to lymphedema and infection damages lymph vessels. I wouldn't worry about any health care provider's feelings (they raise that \"difficult patient\" thing as a form of punishment)--what is essential is YOU and your health. My advice, for what it's worth, is to get re-evaluated, to get on antibiotics and to get cared for. Including a chest evaluation--xray if needed--and maybe an ultrasound. Women on this board have had their seromas drained multiple times before they dry up. It sounds like the drain was maybe pulled too soon, and maybe that's why you're getting such resistance--in the end it doesn't matter--your health is the crucial issue here. Kira ",

DESIGN: Practitioner postal survey. SETTING: Postal survey of practitioners of prolotherapy for back and neck pain in the United States and Canada. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of prolotherapy practitioners from 2 professional organizations were surveyed about their training and experience, use of specific treatment procedures, estimated prevalence of side effects, and adverse events related to prolotherapy for back and neck pain. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of side effects and adverse events. RESULTS: Surveys were completed by 171 practitioners (response rate, 50%). Ninety-eight percent held medical degrees, and 83% were board certified in various disciplines. Respondents had a median of 10 years of experience, during which they had treated a median of 500 patients and given a median of 2000 treatments. Side effects with the highest median estimated prevalence were pain (70%), stiffness (25%), and bruising (5%). There were 472 reports of adverse events, including 69 that required hospitalization and 5 that resulted in permanent injury secondary to nerve injury. The vast majority (80%) were related to needle injuries such as spinal headache (n = 164), pneumothorax (n=123), temporary systemic reactions (n = 73), nerve damage (n = 54), hemorrhage (n = 27), nonsevere spinal cord insult (ie, meningitis, paralysis, spinal cord injury) (n = 9), and disk injury (n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Side effects related to prolotherapy for back and neck pain, such as temporary postinjection pain, stiffness, and bruising, are common and benign. Adverse events related to prolotherapy for back and neck pain are similar in nature to other widely used spinal injection procedures. Further study is needed to fully describe the adverse event profile of prolotherapy for back and neck pain. And to clarify it's use in primary care: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20188998Prim Care. 2010 Mar;37(1):65-80. Prolotherapy in primary care practice. Rabago D, Slattengren A, Zgierska A. Source Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, 777 South Mills Street, Madison, WI 53715, USA. David.rabago@fammed.wisc.edu Abstract Prolotherapy is an injection-based complementary and alternative medical therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain. Prolotherapy techniques and injected solutions vary by condition, clinical severity, and practitioner preferences; over several treatment sessions, a fairly small volume of an irritant or sclerosing solution is injected at sites on painful ligament and tendon insertions and in adjacent joint space during several treatment sessions. Prolotherapy is becoming increasingly popular in the United States and internationally and is actively used in clinical practice. Prolotherapy has been assessed as a treatment for various painful chronic musculoskeletal conditions that are refractory to \"standard of care\" therapies. Although anecdotal clinical success guides the use of prolotherapy for many conditions, clinical trial literature supporting evidence-based decision-making for the use of prolotherapy exists for low back pain, several tendinopathies, and osteoarthritis. If you do a pubmed search for prolotherapy and lymphedema there are zero articles. So, I just don't like the idea of someone injecting an unknown substance into an area with compromised lymphatic function. I also, respectfully disagree wih Dr. Francis as I see a lot of breast lymphedema in the rad onc office where I work, and it NEVER pits--it shows up as swelling, increased pore size, thickening. I'm going to second Binney's comments: interesting, but potentially dangerous. Please Cookie, be careful! And keep us in the loop about this uncharted territory. (I know I'm acting like a killjoy here, but it worries me.) Kira",

Belmonte R, Tejero M, Ferrer M, Muniesa JM, Duarte E, Cunillera O, Escalada F. Source Medicina Física i Rehabilitació, Hospital Mar-Esperança, Barcelona, Spain. Abstract Objective: To compare the efficacy of low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy and manual lymphatic drainage in the treatment of chronic upper limb breast cancer-related lymphoedema.Design: Cross-over single-blind random clinical trial.Setting: Rehabilitation service.Participants: Thirty-six women with chronic upper limb breast cancer-related lymphoedema.Methods: Patients were randomized to undergo 10 sessions of manual lymphatic drainage followed by 10 sessions of low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy or to undergo first low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy followed by manual lymphatic drainage. There was a month of washout time between treatments. Each patient was examined just before and after each treatment. Researchers and outcome assessors were blinded for assigned treatment.Measures: Outcomes were lymphoedema volume, pain, heaviness and tightness, and health-related quality of life measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Questionnaire for Breast Cancer version 4 (FACT-B+4). Carry-over, period and treatment effects were analysed. Treatment effect was assessed using paired t-test.Results: Thirty patients finalized treatment. Comparing the changes in low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy with manual lymphatic drainage changes, there were no significant differences.Low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy did not reduce lymphoedema volume (mean of change = 19.77 mL, P = 0.36), but significant reductions were observed in pain, heaviness and tightness (mean of change = 13.1, 16.2 and 6.4 mm, respectively), and FACT-B+4 summaries improved significantly (Trial Outcome Index mean of change = 5.4, P = 0.015). Manual lymphatic drainage showed no significant changes in any of the outcomesConclusion: Although there are no significant differences between treatment changes, the observed trend towards a better health-related quality of life is remarkable in low-frequency low-intensity electrotherapy. Otter, it has always been my understanding that wrapping/night garments reduce volume and daytime garments maintain the reduction. But, as so many women don't wrap or use night time compression, and many don't swell at night, then I think the daytime compression--along with muscle contractions while wearing them--will achieve/maintain a volume reduction. As Jane Armer and the American Lymphedema Framework Project attempt to find evidence for LE treatment, I've heard, they find very few studies out there, so much of what we know/believe is based on clinical experience.

The lymphedema risk reductions are overwhelmingly based on clinical experience. The movement to debunk them is very dangerous, IMO. The triggering incidence in LE can be minimal--as more evidence based studies show that there is a condition of stage zero lymphedema with no overt swelling, yet protein based lymph fluid is building up in the tissues. If we can avoid triggering lymphedema, and do it fairly simply, why wouldn't we. Ask Binney sometime how she feels with having a chronic disease triggered by a blood pressure measurement: even if the risk is low, if it happens to you, it's 100% I heard a pro/con lecture about this at the NLN and Sheila Ridner PhD said: \"When I sit in a support group, and hear women tell me how a plane flight triggered their LE, I take it seriously.\" On that line, check out Moogie's first posts. There is a lousy study of dragon boat women who flew either short or long flights and the new onset of LE was low, if they didn't wear compression, and the conclusion was that compression wasn't needed on plane flights. Otter actually reviewed the short comings of that study.  Here's the link to the Avon White paper about early diagnosis of LE www.avonfoundation.org/press-r...  The LE risk reductions are in the NLN position paper: www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnri...  III.

There are several reasons for this. The lymphatic system is notoriously ignored in medical curriculums, leaving doctors often at a loss to diagnose or treat lymphedema. This also leads to lymphedema sufferers who don\u2019t know the name of their disease, and thus are unaware that millions suffer similarly. Since the majority of those in the US who suffer from lymphedema are cancer survivors, there has been a tendency on the part of patients to underplay this side effect from cancer treatment, even though they often state that lymphedema can be worse than cancer. The mantra often heard is, \u201cThey cured my cancer. Lymphedema is forever.\u201d Beyond these stated reasons that have played a role in keeping lymphedema under wraps in this country, perhaps no one factor is currently contributing to this more than the fact that the disease has no national public figure that has become its spokesperson. There is no \u201cface\u201d of lymphedema on the national stage. I have talked to physicians who state that they have treated numerous A-List Hollywood celebrities whose careers have hit brick walls due to the onset of lymphedema. They also say that none will come forward. With national dialogue tied to media coverage, and media outlets seeking ratings, attempts for coverage amounts to intermittent trickles of information. Movements are not made from such stuff. We also look for advocates in politics to support our cause and there are potentially two prominent politicians who have been linked to lymphedema. In Ed Klein\u2019s 2005 book, The Truth About Hillary, he writes that a physician who had observed Ms. Clinton after the birth of Chelsea reported to him that \u201cshe was left with a condition called chronic lymphedema.\u201d The physician is further quoted as saying, \u201cThat he suspected Hillary had contracted an obstetrical infection, which was serious enough to damage the lymphatic vessels carrying excess fluid from her legs back into central circulation.\u201d Sen. John McCain\u2019s bout with facial melanoma has been well documented. In a December 30, 2008 article stating that lymphedema is not just a legacy of breast cancer, Fox News reported that, \u201cmelanoma treatment left former presidential candidate John McCain with facial swelling.\u201d I have not found any formal confirmation or denial on the subject from either Former Secretary of State Clinton or Sen. McCain. There is at least one celebrity whose ordeal from lymphedema that is well documented. Three-time Academy Award winning actress Ingrid Bergman suffered from lymphedema after breast cancer surgery in 1974, Her lymphedema would become even more severe after the metastasized cancer resurfaced in 1977 and persisted until her death in 1982. The fact that I needed to speak of a celebrity that died over 30 years ago to make my point, makes my point. Given that cancer treatment can lead to lymphedema in 10% to 50% of treated patients, chances are most people know someone with lymphedema. Chances are equally good that you are unaware of this. Lymphedema sufferers often report a sense of shame about their disease, which causes them to mask it as best they can. In addition to cancer victims, those suffering physical trauma are also candidates for lymphedema, making it a significant issue for our military personal. We need to make lymphatic disease and lymphedema a national priority. First we need to create a national dialogue. Change occurs when those most affected demand it. Eliminate the likes of Gloria Steinem advocating for women\u2019s rights or Martin Luther King, Jr. calling for racial equality and the history of those movements would look very different. As a celebrity who suffers from the disease, Michael J. Fox\u2019s championing of Parkinson\u2019s made the country take notice, and has resulted in considerable funding for research. Champions don\u2019t act alone. Here at the Lymphatic Education & Research Network (LE&RN), we work with fearless parents, patients, researchers, medical professionals and advocates fighting for change. Beyond these frontline soldiers in this cause, we need leaders who become lightening rods that inspire action by those who currently hide their lymphedema and feel they have no voice. Up to ten million Americans, along with their families and friends, wait to hear these voices emerge. With National Lymphedema Awareness Day on March 6th, there couldn\u2019t be a better time to come forward, make your mark and change history. *** William Repicci is Executive Director of the Lymphatic Education & Research Network (LE&RN).

      "Content": "kira wrote: Joe Zuther put this on his blog, and sent an email:The Science behind Manual Lymph Drainage in the Treatment of Lymphedema Posted: 18 Apr 2012 02:58 AM PDT Manual lymph drainage (MLD) is a gentle manual treatment technique based on four basic strokes, which were initially developed in the 1930's by Dr. Emil Vodder, a PhD from Denmark. These basic strokes known as the \"stationary circle\", \"pump\", rotary\" and \"scoop\" techniques are designed to manipulate lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels with the goal of increasing their activity and promote the flow of lymph. Movement of Lymph Fluid in Lymph Vessels The common denominator of all strokes is the resting and working phase. In the working phase of the stroke lymphatic structures located in subcutaneous tissues are stretched, resulting in an increase of their activity (lymphangiomotoricity). In addition to increased lymphatic activity, the light directional pressure in the working phase of the strokes causes lymphatic fluid to move in the desired direction, thus contributing to the reduction of the swelling. Certain MLD strokes are designed to manipulate lymph vessels located in the subcutaneous tissues of larger body surfaces, such as the trunk, other techniques are better suited to be applied on contoured surfaces, such as the extremities. Stationary circle: This technique consists of an oval-shaped stretching of the skin with the palmar surfaces of the fingers or the entire hand. Stationary circles can be applied with one hand, or bimanually and are used on the entire surface of the body, but mainly on lymph node groups (axilla and groin), the neck and the face. Pump technique: The entire palm and the proximal (upper) phalanges are used to apply a circle-shaped pressure on the skin, operating within almost the full range of motion in the wrist. Pumps are primarily used to manipulate lymph vessels located in the extremities and can be applied with one hand or bimanually. Rotary technique: This stroke is used on large body surface areas, such as the trunk. The entire surface of the hand and fingers are used in an elliptical movement during the working phase. Like the scoop technique, rotaries are applied dynamically, meaning the working hand moves over the surface of the treated body part in a continuous fashion. If applied bimanually, the techniques are alternating. Scoop technique: Scoops are applied mainly on the lower parts of extremities and consist of a spiral-shaped movement. During the working phase, which can be applied with one or both hands, the palmar surface of the hand moves dynamically over the skin. The hand movement is facilitated by transitional movement in the wrist, combined with forearm pronation and supination. Lymph Vessels in the Skin Compared to traditional massage, the pressure applied with manual lymph drainage is much lower in intensity. The goal of these techniques is to manipulate the lymphatic structures located in the subcutaneous tissues. In order to achieve the desired effect, the pressure in the working phase should be sufficient enough to stretch the subcutaneous tissues against the fascia (a structure separating the skin from the muscle layer) located underneath, but not to manipulate the underlying muscle tissue. The amount of pressure needed in MLD is sometimes described as the pressure applied stroking a newborn's head. In the resting phase of the stroke the pressure is released, which supports the absorption of lymph fluid into lymph vessels. To achieve the maximum effect with each technique, the working phase with every stroke should last about one second and should be repeated five to seven times. The overall goal of MLD in the treatment of lymphedema is to re-route the flow of stagnated lymphatic fluid around blocked areas into more centrally located healthy lymphatic vessels, which eventually drain into the venous system. In the case of upper extremity lymphedema caused by breast cancer surgery, it is necessary to re-route the flow of stagnated lymph in the subcutaneous tissues of the arm around the blocked axillary area towards and into the axillary lymph nodes on the opposite side and the inguinal lymph nodes on the same side the surgery was performed. These groups of lymph nodes represent the drainage areas for the stagnant lymph fluid located in the affected upper extremity and need to be manipulated prior to initiating the treatment of the arm itself. In the case of lower extremity lymphedema the stagnated lymphatic fluid is generally re-routed around the blocked inguinal (groin) area towards and into the inguinal lymph nodes of the opposite side and the axillary lymph nodes on the same side of blockage. As with lymphedema affecting the upper extremity, these groups of lymph nodes represent the drainage area for the stagnated lymph fluid and need to be manipulated prior to starting treatment of the leg. The manipulation of these drainage areas with MLD strokes creates a \"suction effect\" in the healthy lymph vessels located in the drainage areas, which enables accumulated lymph fluid to move from a region with insufficient lymphatic drainage into an area with normal lymphatic drainage, and eventually back into the venous system. Following this preparation, the extremity itself is treated in segments; the proximal (upper) aspect of the affected extremity is decongested prior to expanding the treatment to the more distal (lower) aspect of the arm or leg. This segmented approach ensures that lymph vessels located in more proximal areas of the extremity are properly prepared to handle incoming lymphatic fluid from areas located more distally. In order to prevent reaccumulation of the fluid evacuated from the extremity, it is necessary that the MLD treatment is followed up with compression, which depending on the stage of treatment, is applied either with specialized padded bandages or compression garments. Manual lymph drainage presents a unique opportunity for health care professionals to specialize and opens the door to treat and manipulate a variety of conditions associated with dysfunctions of the lymphatic system. However, the unique techniques of manual lymph drainage deviate considerably from traditional manual techniques and therefore require specialized training.

      "Content": "Dec 8, 2011 05:31AM - edited Dec 8, 2011 05:33AM by kira Alright, I'm going to wade in here: This was an odd post, as it wasn't a dialogue, but rather an inquiry from a third party who didn't clarify his interest/relationship to the woman in question, and never responded to our posts. I did not take any offense at either Suzy or Tina's posts: I actually found them humorous, and this thread is rarely humorous, so I appreciated them. I teach a first year medical school course: introduction to clinical medicine (and we're working on correct taking of vital signs now) and one of the cardinal rules is to avoid jargon. The average patient has a medical literacy of a fifth grader--obviously that varies widely, and the women on this board are clearly much more medically literate, but their response to to a medical jargon term is the response that most patients have--they feel like they're being confronted with medical language that they can't understand, and they get confused or feel left out of the conversation. So, while I think the issue of taking a blood pressure on an arm with lymphedema is very important, I think the discussion that ensued was entirely appropriate and not disrespectful. If a student used that term in a standardized patient interaction, I'd advise them to modify their language. And on the topic of blood pressure: the last time I went back to my radiation oncologist's office, the nurse gave me a hard time when I declined to have my blood pressure taken on my arm with LE: they used a wrist cuff and she told me it wouldn't work as well on the right arm....I had to argue with her that no cuff, wrist or arm, was going on that arm. And since this was the radiation oncologist who told me that NO study showed that irradiating the level 1 axillary nodes (when I questioned how far up my field went, as I already had LE before rads) caused LE, enough was enough. I never went back. And I'm still steamed at the lack of concern and the misinformation.  Kira ",

Relative contraindications include hypertension, paralysis, diabetes, and bronchial asthma. General contraindications include acute infections of any kind and congestive heart failure. Malignant disease is also widely considered a general contraindication; a current vogue concept is that MLD will lead to dissemination and acceleration of cancer.

Another great resource is the guide from the Livestrong Organization: www.livestrong.org/Get-Help/Le... In this guide, written by a national expert (who has lymphedema) are risk reduction behaviors and how to recognize early symptoms. For now, limit your exercise of the \"at risk\" arm--your lymphatic system is challenged and traumatized. I know you want to get your range of motion and strength back, but lymphedema happens when there is too much blood flow to an area and the lymph system can't handle the filtration. One of our wonderful advisors on this board--Binney--had a first surgeon who would not allow her to use her arm above the elbow for the first week. And she healed beautifully. (It was her second surgery that caused it.) There are some guidelines on the American Cancer institute www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCa... Don't rush them, just do what kschreve suggested: The week after surgery These tips and exercises listed below should be done for the first 3 to 7 days after surgery. Do not do them until you get the OK from your doctor. * Use your affected arm (on the side where your surgery was) as you normally would when you comb your hair, bathe, get dressed, and eat. (Consider limiting use of the arm...) * Lie down and raise your affected arm above the level of your heart for 45 minutes. Do this 2 or 3 times a day. Put your arm on pillows so that your hand is higher than your wrist and your elbow is a little higher than your shoulder. This will help decrease the swelling that may happen after surgery. * Exercise your affected arm while it is raised above the level of your heart by opening and closing your hand 15 to 25 times. Next, bend and straighten your elbow. Repeat this 3 to 4 times a day. This exercise helps reduce swelling by pumping lymph fluid out of your arm. * Practice deep breathing exercises (using your diaphragm) at least 6 times a day. Lie down on your back and take a slow, deep breath. Breathe in as much air as you can while trying to expand your chest and abdomen (push your belly button away from your spine). Relax and breathe out. Repeat this 4 or 5 times. This exercise will help maintain normal movement of your chest, making it easier for your lungs to work. Do deep breathing exercises often. * Do not sleep on your affected arm or lie on that side. And, last but not least, a few of us on this board, with input from many of us on this board, created a website on lymphedema: www.stepup-speakout.org/ Seeing a lymphedema therapist for a baseline exam and advice is a great idea, some centers do it automatically: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... No one knows the true incidence of lymphedema, as there's no one diagnostic criteria, but Jane Armer PhD (who wrote the Livestrong handout) has followed 250 women for almost a decade, and 91% of them have had some swelling at some time. But, she estimates the incidence of lymphedema at a far lower number.  You're aware, you're proactive. You'll educate yourself (no blood draws, IV's, blood pressure cuffs on that arm--ever!) and hopefully you'll  never join the \"swell\" sorority. But we're always here for questions and support. Heal and be well. Kira",

      "Content": "Jul 18, 2009 06:08AM - edited Jul 18, 2009 07:30AM by kira It's hard to add more information than Linda wrote, but as someone who has hand swelling let me add my opinion: 1) Hands are tough: they are not simple cylinders like arms, and the pressure gradient has to be good and the gloves have to fit well to control them. It's all to easy to trap fluid at the wrist and have it go up to the hand. Recently I flared up, and my gloves which have worked for a year, are holding fluid in my hand. And adding swell spots caused a bit of over compression- it-works then the swelling is worse. So, I'm scheduled to see the fitter next week. And, after a lot of work, I have a good team in place: a PT, massage therapist (both LANA certified and excellent) and a great fitter. And believe me, they all were on the phone with me this week. And Binney got some frantic emails. 2) I TOTALLY, agree with Linda--you should NOT get garments until the therapist has instructed you in self-care, manual lymph drainage, wrapping, and treated you to establish stability. Just handing out garments is a dangerous short cut.  3) Daytime compression is the last step of treatment: first is education, then CDT--treatment by the therapist to reduce the size of the swelling and teach you home care, then learning what mixture of night compression: bandaging or special night garments and daytime compression will work for you. It's a process, but when you learn the skills, you can treat the problem. Here's some videos from JoAnn Rovig, owner of jovipak, on how care for yourself with lymphedema. They are not a substitute for a good therapist, but they're educational. http://www.nwlymphedemacenter.org/ Here's a link for treatment from the website http://www.stepup-speakout.org/treatments_for_lymphedema.htm And, here's the position paper on treatment by the National Lymphedema Network, I'd bring it in to your therapist, www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntr...  And as you said, you're new to this, and it stinks to have LE and to learn how to manage it, and it's normal to feel overwhelmed, to grieve at both the beginning (and for me, I get really upset if it acts up at all--my LE massage therapist tells me that's a common reaction) we have a link on the site to Pat O'Connor's article on emotional reactions. And please be gentle to yourself and know that emotional reactions to having to deal with this are normal. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/patoconnorcopng.htm I wrap every night, I wear my gloves, sleeves as needed, and a couple of weeks ago, I grabbed a mattress that my husband was struggling with, and took off my glove to find new swelling in the top of my hand. It's taken two weeks of working on it, and I over did it--as my fitter said \"You're panicking, and sometimes less is more.\" to get it back on the right track. So, it's not easy. My first set of gloves/sleeves were dispensed by a fitter with little knowledge, and they pushed all the fluid into my hand, and the compression class was too high. It's learning process, and not one you wanted to learn. Hang in there. It will get better. If the compression garments make it worse--don't wear them. Kira ",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2014 02:30PM - edited Jun 4, 2014 02:36PM by kira Jo, I looked at the medical literature, and I couldn't find that angiosarcoma only comes from untreated LE--the risks for secondary angiosarcoma are LE and rads. And the average latency period is around 5 years, but can occur both earlier and later.. The consent form for rads always says \"secondary cancer\" or \"another cancer\", but it never details what patients and doctors should be looking for.  Here are the references I found, on a quick search:  Medical review article, short, from 2008 http://www.ajronline.org/doi/full/10.2214/AJR.07.2909 This article divided angiosarcoma into LE associated and rad associated, but clearly both can be present http://sarcomahelp.org/angiosarcoma.html From the National Sarcoma Site In most cases, the cause of a sarcoma is unknown. The most widely known cause of angiosarcoma is lymphedema, the swelling of an area of the body due to the collection of fluid. Angiosarcoma can also occur due to radiation exposure or treatment, and angiosarcoma has been associated with carcinogens such as vinyl chloride, arsenic and thorium dioxide. Angiosarcoma can present in many different ways. It can look like a skin infection, a bruise or a lesion that does not heal. It may have a violet color, and one should be particularly concerned if such an area arises in a site of prior radiation therapy. It might also present as a soft lump that can be felt or seen. Deep-seated tumors may go unnoticed until they begin to affect surrounding tissues and organs. From eMedicine: http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/276512-clinical Risk factors   Again, thank you for letting us know, and although rare, it's something we should know about, so we can seek early treatment. The eMedicine article commented on how the diagnosis was frequently delayed. Kira  ",

It's nothing to do with your stockinette issue. Talk about adding to the confusion. My therapist uses the cotton stockinette and I really like it. It washes great. Here is the blurb from Bandages Plus, I don't know why they're so adamant about it not being used for the first layer, but they sure do say it: TG Soft Manufacturer: Lohmann-Rauscher Availability: In Stock (Usually ships within 24-48 hours.) Providing soft and skin friendly protection, tg soft is ideal for use next to the skin to give a smooth padding effect. This soft terry cloth tubular bandage is highly extensible and can be stretched to about five times its original width. Crease-free and slip resistant, tg soft offers excellent conformability and is latex free. The high cotton content leads to a reduction in the level of moisture and provides wearer comfort. Provides extra comfort and padding under a CircAid or Farrow Wrap. Excellent for people with very fragile skin who may bruise easily. NOT TO BE USED AS THE FIRST LAYER FOR LYMPHEDEMA BANDAGING. Small- for the forearm, foot or childs leg. Measurements are for stretched width Medium- for the lower leg or arm Large- for the leg The stockinette I use is the jersey cotton one, and my therapist insists on giving me new pieces all the time, but I was them, and have tons, I bought a roll of another stockinette, but it's too lacy and unravels all the time: This is what I use in the 8 cm www.bandagesplus.com/prd/39/71...  I own a roll of Tricofix, but don't like it, compared to the jersey cotton. I still don't understand why you can't use the TG soft as the first layer. Can you use it over regular stockinette? Are they concerned about it being next to the skin? Throwing in Caresia, which still requires a stockinette under it, just muddies the waters, IMO. I guess they're trying to help you transition to a night garment. Bandages Plus has high shipping and a no return policy, but they may allow returns of unopened products--it's no returns for garments. I've bought gloves on the internet, and only buy from companies with no shipping and a return policy.

I think they didn't think there was treatment available. Suzy, I started to use Lymphademaproducts because they'll have specials on shipping--I still use the same foam I got in 2008 for the rolled layer--my LE therapist says it's good forever. Kind of weird, but she knows what she's talking about. I did buy some Rosidal soft to replace it, but she doesn't think it needs replacing. Now the gray foam cut outs I replace when they get squashed. Kira",

I had to do a bit of research as I wasn't familiar with angoisarcoma and what kept coming up was that secondary angoisarcoma of the breast is associated with Lymphedema. The concept of MLD spreading cancer has never been proven. I personally think that you should treat the Lymphedema, with mindfulness of your excision scar. The more I read, the key to a good prognosis is catching it early. It sounds like you have a great doctor, and kudos to you for knowing your body and being aware of when to raise concerns. This is rare, but if it's associated with Lymphedema, and there's increased breast LE with SNB, there really needs to be more awareness. Thank you for informing us. I didn't find a second category of lympho angoisarcoma, just that secondary angoisarcoma is associated with LE and rads. Wishing you all the best, and let me know if I can help.

I know a good fitter is worth their weight in gold--but there are very few of them out there. When I went to the NLN I talked to one company about a terrible time I had with one of their preferred jovipak fitters--she saw me for two minutes, quickly took measurements, forgot to fax the order, after a month I called jovi and had it made rush--she had it mailed directly to me--never checked the fit or helped with instructions, and then \"balance billed\" me for the difference between what insurance paid and her invoice (illegal if you're a participating provider for insurance)--and I paid it!--then called my insurance who went after her for the money. So, the woman from jovi said \"hmm, we always wonder why she never, ever calls us about an order--some fitters are never satisfied, and that woman never cals. Makes sense.\" I asked her about some fitters I'd heard about, and she gave them a good recommendation. So, 1) It's not hard to measure, but it's great if your LE therapist will do it. 2) Some fitters are amazing, but far too many are horrible 3) Use the customer service at Lymphadema products and whichever company you go with. One of the best parts of the NLN conference was to finally see many products at once--not just wait weeks for a poorly fitting, over priced garment to show up.... Kira",

And we all got certificates that we're official fitters... Of the CLT's I know nearby, none fit. There is a dirth of fitters in our area, and we have found one to use. Very few CLT's do fitting, for many reasons--not enough training, and the hassle of billing and returns. We were given information about night time garments, but no instructions on how to fit them. I've personally worked to fit a garment for myself and watched all the videos and asked my CLT to help, and it was very difficult. A good fitter can do the measurements in minutes and knows how to make the adjustments that are needed for each manufacturer. Experienced fitters know all the tricks, like to to make a small wrist 1/2 cm bigger and the ins and outs of the various garment companies. I had an experienced fitter who moved out of state, and she preferred Solaris over jovipak as Solaris will work you/them to make it right, while jovi charged 60$/hour for alterations. Jovi has since said you get one free alteration, but Solaris is known to work on a garment again and again until it works for the patient. I think I know all the CLT's in my area, and as we've been working with an inexperienced fitter, I do know some will check her measurments, but none order or bill. Kira",

Also, the pressure in the lymph system actually gets higher as you move more centrally, so the body has to work harder to get the lymph fluid out of the hands. Some suggestions: personally, I almost never wear sleeve, and at this point in time, I only wear my custom glove when needed, but I wrap every night--it's a royal pain, but I've tried Solaris/Jovipak and they don't do a good job for my hand. I recently talked to a great fitter and she agreed. KS1 who doesn't post a lot right now has struggled with hand issues also. So I'd suggest: you learn how to wrap--and to wrap with gray foam inserts under the wrap, as the \"law of LaPlace\" shows that the more we make the hand a circle, the more pressure is actually applied to the hand, and not just the edges (imagine wrapping a book firmly--most of the pressure is on the edges, not the middle--same with the hand, unless we build up the palm/dorum with foam or swell spots) There used to be a great thread pinned to the top by LindaLou showing her hand LE, and she had a picture of how she was wrapped by Steve Norton--owner of  lymphedema training school and a master of foam-- Consider inserts in your gloves--pieces of foam or swell spots to go inside the glove. Consider that a sleeve/glove often puts too much pressure at the wrist and pushes fluid into the hand--some manufacturers--like medi--put half pressure at the wrist to avoid that \"squeeze\" of double pressure from the over lap. In ready made, medi 95 has full pressure in the fingers. Also, I used to do a lot of gauze wrapping of my hand when I was home, instead of gloves, as I found it worked better. I'd suggest you try different gloves/sleeves, learn to wrap and know that hands are particularly tough Here's a piece from Andrea Cheville on why hand protection is needed with a sleeve, and it discusses hand LE: http://www.lymphedivas.com/handprotection.asp  A quote: Compression applied to the arm may reduce lymph flow from the hand. Even a normal lymphatic system works harder to drain lymph from the hand than other parts of the arm. This fact explains why hand lymphedema is often the most challenging to treat and why lymphedema specialists take great pains to prevent it. I bumped LindaLou53's thread--it used to be pinned to the top. I think you'll get a lot of good ideas from it.    Good luck and in my experience, it's hard, but it gets better. Kira ",

The tethering of the skin is a huge issue, and so is the \"volume discrepancy\" and the results after the hematoma. I think there's a natural--but very unfortunate--tendency for surgeons to not want to deal with problems they've created that they don't know how to fix, and their tendency is to blame the victim--imply that you're ungrateful for all their heroics. That's just nonsense, IMO. I work in rad onc, and I mention to women all the time, who have a big volume discrepancy, that we can get them a partial prosthesis and special bra that they can wear when they want to, and it's almost always news to them, and a lot of them take me up on the offer. My breast surgeon--she of the heavy hands and huge desire for cosmesis--just announced that she spent a month in Paris working with a world expert in oncoplastic breast surgery. So, I look up that surgeon's article on oncoplastic breast surgery, and am horrified at the damage done to the tissues in the name of cosmesis--just my opinion, but I heard Janice Cormier (a surgeon who said \"I don't treat LE, I cause it.\") speak at the NLN and she really stressed being gentle to the tissues. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic...

I'm assuming it's the 8 cm version.  My only thought--and I'm speculating here--is that with stretch, the elastin might provide more pressure. Let us know what you find out. It's usual to use padding over the stockinette: either artiflex or a thin foam roll: it distributes the pressure and protects your arm. You said your therapist doesn't use any padding? Just short stretch over stockinette? Everyone's different, but I've never heard of not using a form of padding.  Polly switched to Lymphedema Products from Bandages Plus, and I know they give 15% off for the first order. I have talked to the women at BandagesPlus and they have been generally helpful. I think the head woman is Renee Romano. I stock up, and my closets look like a medical supply wearhouse... Kira ",

I can only wonder what it feels like to be married to a woman has to wrap every night.... Just finished reading \"The Emperor of All Maladies\" and was struck by 1)how little oncologists knew/know about cancer and are just beginning to figure things out and 2) how the \"sucess\" model is someone who goes into a sustained remission and moves on. Well, LE doesn't let you move on. My oncologist was quoted in it, and he doesn't like clinical work much, so I read his quote with great interest. The man who told another woman on these boards who asked how she'd know if the armidex was working \"You'd get mets.\" I totally digress. Our new nornal is not normal, but then, whose really is? It does totally stink to be limited and to turn to our loved ones for help, and everyone burns out on caretaking at some point. And, home improvements are often testy times.

And, while it's not as good as wrapping, it's quite close. And I've been using it to \"spell\" me a few times a week.  So, in some ideal world, I could just slip on my custom Tribute, but with the minor modifications, it works for my hand. When I went to the NLN conference in Orlando, I picked up a jovipak book, and it stated that they were always meant to be wrapped over--news to me--but the jovipak just doesn't do my fingers.  My fingers are buried in the Tribute, and Kathy explained why they do that--to minimize trapping fluid at the tips and to allow them to create pressure across the fingers--and sometimes that is tough on my cuticles.

It is very thick and tight andoriginates at the mastectomy incision- but ROM can resolve w/ the same techniques we do for true AWS. Unfortunately, the cord will always be present unless released surgically even when ROM is restored.   I don't recommend surgical release due to the lymphedema precautions unless they are having another procedure anyway. I would clarify that the \"Pseudo cording\" SEEMs to only occur with mastectomy, in my experience, with or without reconstruction.

Source Department of Dermatology, Phlebology and Lymphology, Nij Smellinghe Hospital, Drachten, The Netherlands. r.damstra@nijsmellinghe.nl Abstract OBJECTIVE: Short stretch bandages are very effective in the initial management of arm lymphedema. However, no studies to date have measured the pressure required to achieve specific amounts of volume reduction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between low and high-pressure bandaging in terms of therapeutically intended volume reduction of the compressed arm. METHODS: Experimental, randomized and comparative study with two study-groups consisting of high and low initial interface pressure bandages. Thirty-six hospitalized patients in Nij Smellinghe hospital suffering from moderate to severe unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema not responsive to outpatient treatment were included. Bilateral arm volume was measured by inverse water volumetry before, after two hours and after 24 hours of bandaging. The amount of edema was calculated by subtracting the volume of the diseased arm from that of the contralateral side. Sub-bandage pressure was measured after bandage application and two hours later. Bandages were then re-applied and the pressure was measured again. Twenty-four hours later, the pressure measurement was repeated and bandages were removed for final volumetry. Patients were randomized into two groups: group A received low pressure bandages (20-30 mm Hg) and group B received high pressure bandages (44-58 mm Hg). The main outcome measures were reduction of arm volume and edema volume in the affected arm in both study groups. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in sub-bandage pressure and patient comfort. RESULTS: Median arm volume reduction after two and 24 hours was 104.5 mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.2-184.2) (-2.5%) (P < .0001) and 217 mL (95% CI, 143.9-280.2) (-5.2%) (P < .01) for group A and 56.5 mL (95% CI, -2.7-123.1) (n.s.) and 167.5 mL (95% CI, 105.2-316.1) (-4.2%) (P < .01) for group B, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the volume changes in group A and group B. After 24 hours, edema decreased by median percentage of 9.2% in group A and 4.8% in group B (n.s.). Bandages in group A were better tolerated. The sub-bandage pressure drop in the first two hours was between 41% and 48% in both treatment groups at both measuring sites. After 24 hours, the pressure drop was between 55% and 63%. No proximal swelling above the bandage was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Inelastic, multi-layer, multi-component compression bandages with lower pressure (20-30 mm Hg) are better tolerated and achieve the same amount of arm volume reduction as bandages applied with higher pressure (44-58 mm Hg) in the first 24 hours.",

I do have a LE LMT and she spends the entire time on massage. All the other LE PT's I saw spent more time justifying the insurance requirements, and one actually NEVER touched me--just handed me a theraband that gave me a recurrence of axillary web. I have to confess, I knew nothing about LE after 20+ years of practice, and teaching--I had a patient with primary LE and I sent her to a vascular surgeon who said there was no treatment. I teach first year medical students in the physical diagnosis course--not a word about LE. The reason many physicians deny our reality is that they seriously don't understand it.  No one has an encylopedic memory--I tell my students all the time, I trust the doctor who frankly says, \"I don't know--let me research that or call someone.\" vs. the person who always has all the answers, as that is just not possible. So, if your PCP won't acknowledge your LE--she needs some serious discussion and education about don't deny what you don't understand. Have her read the Livestrong Handout www.livestrong.org/Get-Help/Le... And, as I'm always quoting from my oncology textbook: \"Therapeutic nihilism (i.e. no treatment at all) is deplorable, although common. The fact that the average clinician is ill prepared to recognize early stages of lymphedema must be remedied, because the sooner the treatment is started, the less treatment is required to prevent further progression.\" I knew enough to be worried about LE, and to refer myself to the LE clinic, where no one told me risk reductions, so I didn't know what to do. I consider myself informed: board certified, go to lots of conferences, teach at a medical school--and I was CLUELESS. I'm signed up for the National Lymphedema Conference in a couple of weeks, for a belated education. Thank goodness for Binney and the women on these boards. Now, I work in radiation oncology and I find and treat LE all the time. Funny how it was all around me, and I didn't know. Kira",

So is post-op swelling--both should be evaluated by a lymphedema therapist, both to get baseline measurements, to work on the cords, and to follow you. For now, rest the arm--no baskets making dents.

The treatment is to stretch, but at this point, you're trying to heal the delicate lymphatics in the axilla, so overhead stretching should be minimized. You just had two surgeries, you're in the acute healing phase, and I would just recommend the ACS exercises for the first week post-op http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/MoreInformation/exercises-after-breast-surgery The week after surgery These tips and exercises listed below should be done for the first 3 to 7 days after surgery. Do not do them until you get the OK from your doctor. * Use your affected arm (on the side where your surgery was) as you normally would when you comb your hair, bathe, get dressed, and eat. * Lie down and raise your affected arm above the level of your heart for 45 minutes. Do this 2 or 3 times a day. Put your arm on pillows so that your hand is higher than your wrist and your elbow is a little higher than your shoulder. This will help decrease the swelling that may happen after surgery. * Exercise your affected arm while it is raised above the level of your heart by opening and closing your hand 15 to 25 times. Next, bend and straighten your elbow. Repeat this 3 to 4 times a day. This exercise helps reduce swelling by pumping lymph fluid out of your arm. * Practice deep breathing exercises (using your diaphragm) at least 6 times a day. Lie down on your back and take a slow, deep breath. Breathe in as much air as you can while trying to expand your chest and abdomen (push your belly button away from your spine). Relax and breathe out. Repeat this 4 or 5 times. This exercise will help maintain normal movement of your chest, making it easier for your lungs to work. Do deep breathing exercises often. * Do not sleep on your affected arm or lie on that side. Kira",

On the stepupspeakout site, there's a section about what to do while waiting for your first LE therapist appointment: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#while%20waiting What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled.

Did she give/sell you a gauntlet--it's recommended that you protect the hand, so as not to push fluid up there with the sleeve. There's an article about it on the LymphaDiva's site: lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gau... Importance of Compression Sleeve and Gauntlet Combination USE OF GAUNTLETS AND COMPRESSION SLEEVES IN LYMPHEDEMA MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION Dr. Andrea Cheville, Associate Professor of Physical Medicine at the Mayo Clinic Controversy persists regarding the benefits of compression garments in preventing lymphedema. A key stumbling block is the possibility of triggering hand lymphedema when wearing a sleeve without a glove or gauntlet. Compression applied to the arm may reduce lymph flow from the hand. Even a normal lymphatic system works harder to drain lymph from the hand than other parts of the arm. This fact explains why hand lymphedema is often the most challenging to treat and why lymphedema specialists take great pains to prevent it. Concern that compression sleeves may inadvertently trigger hand lymphedema underlies the recommendation to always wear a compression gauntlet or glove with a sleeve. Most women at risk for lymphedema who have not noted increased arm volume, symptoms, or other indicators of early lymphedema wear their sleeves during activities that increase lymph production. Examples include airplane travel, vigorous aerobic or resistive exercise, and repetitive activities performed in an intense fashion. It is important that women using preventative compression sleeves combine their sleeve with either a gauntlet or glove during such activities. Particular attention should be paid to constriction at the shoulder band, elbow, and wrist crease. Sometimes overlap of a gauntlet and sleeve at the wrist can cause excessive pressure. For women with established lymphedema the decision to use a gauntlet or glove is based on slightly different considerations. Lymphedema of the upper limb may be distributed in a surprisingly patchy manner. For example, lymphedema may be restricted to the underside of the upper arm or the back of the hand. It goes unsaid that lymphedema is a very individual phenomenon. Many women with lymphedema never note hand involvement despite use of an arm compression sleeve for many years. However, even these women should remain watchful for hand swelling since lymphedema is a dynamic process with the potential to change over time. A quick check for hand edema after engaging in the activities listed above is always warranted. Differences in skin texture or the visibility of bones, veins and tendons may indicate lymphedema. These changes suggest a need to consider some form of hand compression. Of particular concern are women with lymphedema that plan to begin an exercise program or to significantly increase their activity and do not use hand compression. For these individuals use of hand compression during exertion is crucial until a stable level has been established. At that point a woman may carefully experiment with using a sleeve alone. However, it is always prudent and appropriate to use hand compression during vigorous arm activity. As previously noted, hand lymphedema is more difficult to control than arm lymphedema. The hand's irregular shape, its critical role in daily activities and the difficulty inherent in precisely fitting a gauntlet/glove all contribute to this problem. It is vital that early signs of hand lymphedema be taken seriously and that appropriate modifications are made to a patient's lymphedema maintenance program. In summary, a gauntlet or glove should be used in conjunction with compression sleeves when used for lymphedema prevention. Women with established lymphedema who have not required hand compression should consider adding a glove or gauntlet in situations that may increase lymph production in their arms. Many patients with lymphedema spend their entire lives well-controlled with use of a sleeve alone. A good comparison to the decision to wear a gauntlet/glove with a sleeve is that it is like buying insurance. The risk of having hand lymphedema is present in all women with arm lymphedema and those at risk. Adding a gauntlet buys some protection against this event and like all insured risk, we do not know who will be helped by the insurance and who might not even need it. Working with physicians and therapists skilled in lymphedema management will ensure that each woman develops a safe and effective compression plan tailored to her unique needs. Have a great trip, and maybe it was the talk your husband needed to kick the habit! Kira",

Methods and Findings Lymphedema was induced by microsurgical ablation of major lymphatic conduits in the murine tail. Untreated control mice with lymphedema developed significant edema and extensive histopathological inflammation compared to sham surgical controls. Short-term ketoprofen treatment reduced tail edema and normalized the histopathology while paradoxically increasing TNF-α gene expression and cytokine levels. Conversely, sTNF-R1 treatment increased tail volume, exacerbated the histopathology, and decreased TNF-α gene expression. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which stimulates lymphangiogenesis, closely correlated with TNF-α expression. Conclusions Ketoprofen therapy reduces experimental post-surgical lymphedema, yet direct TNF-α inhibition does not. Reducing inflammation while preserving TNF-α activity appears to optimize the repair response. It is possible that the observed favorable responses, at least in part, are mediated through enhanced VEGF-C signaling. ",

John P. Cooke* + Author Affiliations Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, CA ↵* Corresponding author; email: john.cooke@stanford.edu Abstract At the level of the capillaries, the systemic circulation loses about 2-4 liters of fluid and about 100g of protein into the interstitium daily. This ultrafiltrate of the systemic capillaries is returned to the circulatory system by the lymphatics. The lymphatic vasculature is highly specialized to perform this service, beginning with the blind-ended lymphatic capillaries. These vessels are highly permeable to protein, fluid and even cells, due to fenestrations in their basement membrane, and discontinuous button-like junctions rather than tight intercellular junctions as observed in the systemic capillaries1. The lymphatic capillaries merge into collectors and larger lymphatic conduits that are invested with vascular smooth muscle (capable of contracting and propelling lymph forward) and valves for unidirectional flow. These conduits merge at lymph nodes, delivering antigens to the immune cells and serving as an early warning system of pathogen invasion. The lymph nodes drain into conduits that ultimately merge into the thoracic duct which empties into the left subclavian vein.

In this study, retinoic acids (RAs) were determined to be a potenttherapeutic agent that is immediately applicable to reduce secondary lymphedema. Methods and Results-We report that RAs promote proliferation, migration and tube formation ofcultured lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) by activating FGF-receptor signaling. Moreover, RAs control the expression of cell-cycle checkpoint regulators such as p27Kip1, p57Kip2 and the aurora kinases through both an Akt-mediated non-genomic action and a transcription-dependent genomic action that is mediated by Prox1, a master regulator of lymphatic development. Moreover, 9-cisRAwas found to activate in vivo lymphangiogenesis in animals based on mouse trachea, matrigel plug and cornea pocket assays. Finally, we demonstrate that 9-cisRA can provide a strong therapeutic efficacy in ameliorating the experimental mouse tail lymphedema by enhancing lymphatic vessel regeneration. Conclusions-These in vitro and animal studies demonstrate that 9-cisRA potently activates lymphangiogenesis and promotes lymphatic regeneration in an experimental lymphedema model, presenting it as a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat human lymphedema patients. I'll see if I can get this article, but all I know about retinoic acid is retin-A and accutane.... Kira ",

(Nov 9) Lymphedema and lymphatic disorders continue to be largely ignored in the medical community in spite of the fact that millions of Americans, including many with cancer-related lymphedema, suffer from this chronic, incurable, and often debilitating condition. The NLN Medical Advisory Committee wishes to respond to a comment about pain and lymphedema published in the Nov 16 letters section in which Nicole Stout, a respected lymphedema clinician and researcher, stated that \"lymphedema in itself is not a painful condition, nor should it be\" and \"pain...is commonly a sign of a more serious medical condition\". In actuality, research indicates that many patients suffer significant pain and discomfort associated with the lymphedema itself, which often ameliorates with appropriate treatment of the swelling. However, since Ms. Stout is correct in pointing out that in certain cases pain may indicate a more serious medical condition, the NLN emphasizes that thorough medical evaluation of all symptoms associated with lymphedema, including pain, is necessary to rule out other causes of symptoms. Since publication of Ms. Stout's letter, we have received numerous calls from patients with lymphedema expressing confusion, anger and fear occasioned by Ms. Stout's remarks. As an internationally recognized grassroots organization whose mission is to serve and advocate for people with lymphedema and the professionals who treat this disorder, the NLN wishes to help clarify the issue. Respectfully, Saskia R.J. Thiadens RN Executive Director  ",

Epub 2007 Mar 8. Lymphedema therapy reduces the volume of edema and pain in patients with breast cancer. Hamner JB, Fleming MD. Department of Surgery, University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center, 956 Court Avenue, Room G228, Memphis, Tennessee 38163, USA. jhamner@utmem.edu Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite recent advances in breast-conserving surgery, upper-extremity lymphedema remains a problem for patients after the treatment of breast cancer. This study examines the results of a protocol of therapy for lymphedema in breast cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 135 patients with lymphedema after breast cancer treatment were provided a protocol of complete decongestive therapy (CDT). This involved manual lymphatic drainage, compression garments, skin care, and range-of-motion exercises. Therapy was divided into an induction phase involving twice-weekly therapy for 8 weeks and maintenance therapy individualized to patient needs. Absolute volume and percentage of volume of lymphedema was compared before and after treatment. Also assessed was the degree of chronic pain and the need for pain medication. RESULTS: Mean initial lymphedema volume was 709 mL, and the percentage of lymphedema was 31%. The induction phase of CDT reduced this to 473 mL and 18%, respectively. Before therapy, 76 patients had chronic pain and 41 required oral pain medication. CDT reduced this to 20 and 11, respectively. The degree of pain was also assessed on a numerical scale from 0 to 10. Those patients with chronic pain initially rated their pain at an average of 6.9. After treatment, this was reduced to 1.1. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema continues to be a problem for patients with breast cancer. A program of lymphedema therapy can reduce the volume of edema and reduce pain in this population. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20552814 Impact of lymphedema and arm symptoms on quality of life in breast cancer survivors. Hormes JM, Bryan C, Lytle LA, Gross CR, Ahmed RL, Troxel AB, Schmitz KH. Department of Psychology, University of Pennsylvania , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6021, USA. Abstract Lymphedema is one of many arm problems reported by breast cancer survivors. Understanding the impact of lymphedema on quality of life requires consideration that arm symptoms may occur with or without lymphedema. It was hypothesized that specific arm symptoms and pain, related or unrelated to lymphedema, would be more associated with quality of life outcomes than arm swelling. The relation of arm swelling and of arm symptoms and associated severity with a range of quality of life outcomes following breast cancer treatment was assessed in a diverse sample of 295 women, 141 of whom had a clinical diagnosis of lymphedema. Arm swelling (as defined by interlimb volume or circumference differences) and lymphedema severity (defined by Common Toxicity Criteria) were less correlated with quality of life than total number of arm symptoms and specific individual symptoms. Pain in the affected arm correlated with poor quality of life outcomes, regardless of arm swelling. When evaluating the impact of lymphedema on quality of life, arm swelling may not be as important as the total number and specific types of arm symptoms present, as these may be more informative about quality of life outcomes in survivors of breast cancer with and without lymphedema.

If, in fact, pain is present, it is commonly a sign of a more serious medical complication that must be managed, primarily infection, blood clot or malignancy.    I realize that her full letter was highly edited, but she was not misquoted. She wrote this statement, and supports it.     She did have a lengthy correspondence with me, where she clarified that she recognizes that lymphedema can be associated with pain. But that is not the statement that was published.   As a former member of your medical advisory board, and a current board member of the APTA, and as she wrote in the letter--a researcher--this comment becomes expert opinion. In the public press--it's searchable and quotable, and becomes a reference.   That worries me. As we know, there is so little information about lymphedema in the medical and general community. I can see a situation where a patient presents with a swollen, painful lymphedematous breast and is told--\"This can't be lymphedema, it's painful, and lymphedema isn't painful.\"   In my experience, and per Dr. Cheville's wonderful lecture, there is pain and/or discomfort associated with lymphedema--through inflammation and nocioceptor responses to tissue derangement.    Many of the men and women we deal with on the stepupspeakout.org site, and that I deal with in my office, are told that they don't have lymphedema--as most medical providers don't know how to recognize it or treat it. If they are told that the pain they experience with their limb, breast, trunk or genital swelling precludes the diagnosis of lymphedema, then this will create a further barrier to ideal goal of early recognition and treatment.    With the goal of educating health care providers, patients and supporting people with lymphedema, I would hope that you attempt to clarify this statement.    Thank you for consideration. I personally find this \"pushes my buttons\" because the attitude is that we patients are not worthy of being part of the dialogue and our observations and insights about our condition are not valid. Glad the post is down: it went up Tuesday am. I never even knew the NLN was on facebook. Kira",

I wear a custom glove--it's Juzo helastic, so it's a flat knit, and I don't wear sleeves that often, but have the Juzo and medi 95. I'd love to feel these sleeves to compare.

My fitter doesn't like it because she thinks it runs too short, and it only comes in one length. Jobst is used a lot because the sizes are so \"generous\"--they just come in three sizes with a huge over lap. I hope Binney comes along to answer this, but she usually recommends having a sleeve/gauntlet for higher altitudes. An airplane is compressed to about 8000 feet, and you're going pretty high up. People do get altitude sickness at those heights: high altitude headaches, and pulmonary edema--so edema at high altitudes is possible, but not inevitable. Hopefully your trip will be uneventful, but it's safer to have the gauntlet, because the sleeve can push fluid up into the hand (think of a rubber band around your wrist). I know the new Jobst says it has less wrist compression, and more at the forearm, but it still has the potential to push fluid up. Some doctors just write for compression garments--and leave the extent of what you get up to you. Was the fitter a lymphedema therapist, or just a fitter? A good fitter is a wonderful thing, but a fitter is  a person who is trained to measure and dispense, not a lymphedema therapist--although some therapists do fit and order garments. Kira ",

I got no post op instructions, so I was wall walking and stretching constantly overhead and had an egg of seroma in my arm pit. I had almost a dozen cords and first felt the pain in my hand. Then I saw them in the mirror, and googled \"cord in axilla after breast surgery\" and figured out what it was. I did see a PT, but she,unfortunately, had me do more stretches and repetetive motions--and then on a hot day, I got bug bites on that arm--three weeks post op, and my hand swelled, and it has never fully resolved. This was all prior to radiation. There was an article in the British Medical Journal, and about early PT to avoid lymphedema, and they found that women who got a ton of cords early on, were at much higher risk for LE: www.stepup-speakout.org/essent...  Axillary Web Syndrome is a risk factor for lymphedema: In a study of early PT to minimize lymphedema, a subset of patients who developed axillary web syndrome at 3-4 weeks post-op had an almost universal development of lymphedema, despite intervention http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068255 BMJ. 2010; 340: b5396. Published online 2010 January 12. \"We also found that 12 of the 18 women who developed secondary lymphoedema had axillary web syndrome during the second and third week after surgery. The axillary web syndrome is a known but poorly studied complication of surgery. No study has shown any link between the axillary web syndrome and the onset of secondary lymphoedema. We and others suggest that the axillary web syndrome may be a sign of injury to the lymphatic system and it could produce a lymphatic overload as a result of failure of the lymphatic system. This overload, together with other factors, could be responsible for the onset of secondary lymphoedema\"   So, I think early extensive cording, and if there's also a seroma, is a big risk factor for LE, as it's a time of risk and inflammation. I got PT for it--my LE therapist is an LMT and doesn't feel comfortable manipulating cords--and the initial painful stuff got much better on it's own in about 8 weeks, but some cords lingered. And still, one will pop up in the area of my elbow at times. And even a few weeks ago, a cord reappeared in my axilla/upper arm--maybe due to lifting boxes--and went away with stretching. Sorry about the long post. Kate, yoga is good, you just have to modify it. Love your avatar. Kira ",

Abstract BACKGROUND: We assess complication rates in node negative breast cancer patients treated with breast radiotherapy (RT) only after sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2001, 226 women with AJCC stage I-II breast cancer were treated with lumpectomy, either SLND or SLND+ALND, and had available toxicities in follow-up: 111/136 (82%) and 115/129 (89%) in SLND and ALND groups, respectively. RT targeted the breast to median dose of 48.2 Gy (range, 46.0 to 50.4 Gy) without axillary RT. Chi-square tests compared complication rates of 2 groups for axillary web syndrome (AWS), seroma, wound infection, decreased range of motion of the ipsilateral shoulder, paresthesia, and lymphedema. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 9.9 years (range, 8.3-15.3 y). Median number of nodes assessed was 2 (range, 1-5) in SLND and 18 (range, 7-36) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Acute complications occurred during the first 2 years and were AWS, seroma, and wound infection. Incidences of seroma 5/111 (4.5%) in SLND and 16/115 (13.9%) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.02, respectively) and wound infection 3/111 (2.7%) in SLND and 10/115 (8.7%) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.05, respectively) differed significantly. AWS was not statistically different between the groups. At 10 years, the only chronic complications decreased were range of motion of the shoulder 46/111 (41.4%) in SLND and 92/115 (80.0%) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), paresthesia 12/111 (10.8%) in SLND and 39/115 (33.9%) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.0001), and lymphedema assessed by patients 10/111 (10.0%) in SLND and 39/115 (33.9%) in ALND (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). Chronic lymphedema, assessed by clinicians, occurred in 6/111 (5.4%) in SLND and 21/115 (18.3%) in ALND cohorts, respectively (P\u2009<\u20090.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our mature findings support that in patients with negative axillary nodal status SLND and breast RT provide excellent long-term cure rates while avoiding morbidities associated with ALND or addition of axillary RT field.

I wrap every night--and it's comfortable.

This law shows that sub-bandage pressure will: ■ rise with increasing bandage tension and number of bandage layers ■ decrease with increasing limb circumference and bandage width. In practice, therefore, Laplace's Law shows that for a larger limb requiring high levels of compression, the desired pressure may be achieved by increasing the number of bandage layers applied and increasing the tension used during application  But, my therapist doesn't believe in excessive tension, and I completely agree with her--as she says, if it's painful, it's hurting the superficial lymphatics that are just under the skin.

There was an article in Family Practice News about a physician who was using ear stimulator accupuncture for pain, with good results, and it wouldn't involve needles in arms with LE www.familypracticenews.com/art...    In 2005, family physician Robert Bonakdar was searching through PubMed in preparation for a lecture he was about to deliver to physicians on the nonpharmacologic treatment of chronic pain. He came across two randomized controlled trials that described a disposable device that provides 1 Hz of continuous electrical stimulation to auricular acupuncture points as a treatment for chronic cervical pain and chronic lower back pain. \u201cThey showed that these ear treatments helped after 4 weeks of treatment,\u201d recalled Dr. Bonakdar, director of pain management at the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine in La Jolla, Calif. \u201cI was intrigued.\u201d He contacted the gadget's inventor, Dr. Josef C. Széles, a vascular surgeon in Vienna, who traveled to San Diego and showed Dr. Bonakdar how to use the device, which is called pulse stimulation treatment (previously known as IS-3 and P-STIM in Europe). Since then Dr. Bonakdar has treated scores of patients with pulse stimulation treatment (PST) and has found it particularly effective for patients with shingles and other forms of neuropathic pain. \u201cThere is a central sensitization phenomenon where the brain takes over and amplifies what would otherwise be a normal healing process and makes the pain worse,\u201d Dr. Bonakdar explained. \u201cThat happens mostly in neuropathic pain and quasineuropathic syndromes such as fibromyalgia, phantom limb pain, or complex regional pain syndrome. This is a way to give a benign signal to redirect the brain.\u201d Approved by the Food and Drug Administration for acute and chronic pain in 2006, the PST is a battery-powered controlled nerve stimulator that weighs about 7 g and is fastened behind the ear by an adhesive backing. Tiny titanium acupuncture needles are placed in three points of the outer ear that are considered to be indirect measures of nerve activity. Electrodes are then attached to the needles, which deliver 1 Hz of energy 3 hours at a time over the course of 4 days. \u201cFrom an acupuncture standpoint, 1 Hz is the universal endorphin releaser,\u201d said Dr. Bonakdar, who also performs traditional acupuncture and electrostimulation. \u201cThe patient feels a tapping for 3 hours; then PST goes off for 3 hours. From a neurological standpoint, this is really percutaneous auricular nerve stimulation, or PANS. The intriguing part is, there is nowhere else on the body besides the ear where I can so easily access the vagal nerve.\u201d Most patients need 4\u20136 treatments of 4 days' duration (each requiring one of the devices) to achieve good results, which Dr. Bonakdar defined as achieving 33%\u201350% reduction in their pain based on traditional pain scores such as the Brief Pain Inventory. In his experience 60%\u201375% of patients achieve about a 50% reduction in their pain after 4\u20136 weeks of treatment. Others, including a woman he previously treated for pain related to shingles, achieved near-immediate results. Before treatment she was taking 18 narcotic tablets per day for symptom relief. The day after PST, that dropped to just 4 tablets per day. \u201cOver the next 4 weeks she went off the medicines completely,\u201d Dr. Bonakdar said. \u201cWith traditional acupuncture, you don't often get that immediate and strong effect. That's happened enough times to [make me think] we're hitting a direct circuit right from the vagal nerve to the brain stem with the PST.\u201d In mid-2008 Nu-Life Technologies acquired the distribution rights and license to the patents for the PST (www.pst4life.com). In an interview, Nu-Life's CEO, Jim Robertson, said that the device will be available to physicians in the United States in October 2008, but the company's initial focus is to offer it to existing pain clinics that already have a high base of patients. The business plan analogy he used was being \u201clike a McDonald's inside of a Wal-Mart, where we put a fully turnkey package inside or attached to large pain centers.\u201d Mr. Robertson anticipates the cost of each PST to range from $350 to $425. Dr. Bonakdar is a member of Nu-Life's medical advisory board. He receives no compensation for his role and has no financial interest in the company, but Nu-Life does supply him with PSTs to use in clinical practice. Dr. Széles is working with Nu-Life to develop the next-generation PST.   Accupuncture is considered relatively effective for pain, but is very practitioner dependent--you need to find someone good you can work with, and they shouldn't be putting needles in your bad arm. I don't have brachial plexopathy, but I've definitely taken care of people with neuropathic pain: it's a hard thing to treat--people try TENS units, the usual meds you mentioned--neurontin, low dose tricyclic antidepressants, dual reuptake anti depressants, other neuroleptic drugs, and pain management centers run by anesthesiologists will do nerve blocks. Totally anecdotal, but in the book \"Lopsided\", she got relieve from her neuropathy from chemo with B6--but it's toxic at high doses. I hope you find some relief. Kira ",

She offered me two options: lumpectomy or mastectomy, she's concerned that my breasts are small and that the results with lumpectomy would possibly be \"deforming\"--because of my desire to move quickly, she can't offer me immediate reconstruction, but could do a mastectomy with the option for reconstruction at any point.

She'll call me Thursday night with the recommendations from the tumor board who will have the ER/PR/Her status. The surgery will be done with sentinel node.

      "Content": "May 19, 2008 07:45AM - edited May 19, 2008 07:48AM by kira Well, I had the lumpectomy with SNB on Friday: I chose local and IV sedation, and--?unfortunately--I was aware of a fair amount of what was going on. Aware enough to remind them as I heard that they were going to hang a bag of ancef, that I'm allergic to it, it said so right on my red wrist band. As the surgeon, who worked so hard to do a \"good\" job, thought she was waking me up, said--and she was all business in the OR--I'm just not happy with the way this looks. And I opened my eyes, and said \"But that's not what I care about, I care about seeing my grandchildren grow up, and living.\" She was pretty upset about the level of my anesthesia--gave me her home #, told me she lives two blocks away and would make a house call if needed. Overall, I'm doing okay. I was glad to be able to come that night, and recover in my own bed. The pain isn't bad, the inability to lift is hard to handle. I did have the moment of truth with the first shower and looking at the site--it's less upsetting each day. The recovery room nurse was a patient of mine, all through the experience I ran into patients and colleagues--so much for privacy. The risk of local recurrence has been discussed: I found an article in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, from May 10, 2008 (pretty recent) and they found recurrence rates depended on receptor status-the lowest risk was ER+/PR+/Her---overall the local recurrence rate with lumpectomy/radiation was below 10% , but with the receptor status ER+/PR+/Hec-, it was 1.5 %. I met with the radiation oncologist, for a consult, in case that is the final outcome: she told me that the local recurrence is half that of a mastectomy, because even with a mastectomy there is breast tissue left behind--but the absolute numbers were still low. She told me about a new protocol for quadrant irradiation, vs. total breast, and that by the time I'd be ready for radiation, I'll be 50, and eligible, and it looks promising. I have to decide if I'm willing to trade less radiation for a newer clinical protocol. Again, the goal is life here. So, for me, the decision to move quickly with the lumpectomy and SNB ( she took 2 sentinel nodes, and one that was tucked between the two and didn't light up) was the right one for me. I'm waiting to see her and get the pathology, node status, and find out what is the next step. That information will influence what the next decision will be. I know the surgeon isn't happy with the cosmesis--aside from the bruising, it doesn't bother me. I'm currently feeling better--tylenol is enough for pain--but tired and beat up (emotionally and otherwise). I missed my daughter's college commencement yesterday--she had graduated in December, but I urged her to go to the ceremony. But she come over afterward and they filmed the ceremony. I thank you all for your thoughtful and supportive comments. And, I'll let you know what happens. Kira As the surgeon helped onto the table, she told me I made the right choice....",

Do you have a LE therapist? That person should guide you on how you need to treat: many people would be wrapping the bigger arm to get it down to size, and then getting you some compression garments. Compression garment wearing is a bit of trial and error: your therapist can guide you: you want to maintain the smaller size that you've gotten through wrapping and therapy. Some people only need to wear compression during activities or hot weather, others need to wear it all day--and the need can vary as our LE waxes and wanes. With likely both sides LE: it means you should not get blood drawn from your arms, but rather your feet. Definitely a clot can damage vasculature and cause a \"post DVT\" syndrome--it's a vein problem, and the swelling can get confused with LE--that's where a good therapist is essential. Since the lymph vessels run near veins and leaky veins leak more protein, the two are linked. I hope one of the women who know more about bilat LE post soon. Good luck. Kira ",

My LE therapist told me about a patient who got poked by a wicker basket, and went to the ER and they didn't give her antibiotics, and she got a whooping cellulitis. I keep bacitracin and bactroban in my purse.

If you do a pubmed search, Dr. Piller wrote an article back in 1998 about following women for 2.5 years, but they only had modest improvements.  In an interview article with the other author of the paper that got the rian laser FDA approval, the doctor said how the laser works is \"a mystery\". The article is : Laser MAY reduce lymphedema www.annieappleseedproject.org/...  It is approved by the FDA as a level two device, which means any reporting of side effects is voluntary. When drugs come to market, they're tested on about two thousand patients, and then if they're popular, a few million use them, and the side effects start to manifest--like vioxx, fen-phen, some of the quinolone antibiotics, seldane, baychol, avandia--just to name a few favorites from recent years. Personally, I am not comfortable having someone use a device on me where the mechanism is a mystery, and no long term follow up studies exist. The FDA has a way for consumers to report problems, and it's private and easy http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/how.htm So, on the boards we have posts from Trisha who is thrilled with the laser, and others who have bought it and really like it, and a post from a woman who feels it may have caused brachial plexopathy. It worries me, because LE in general has few options and of course we're going to want to try something that holds the promise of a lasting improvement. So, I just wanted to state my concerns--and I don't want to discredit the laser, because I don't have enough information to judge it. But I'd love to hear what people have experienced.

Rian wrote me that they do not intend to ever do further studies of the laser. That's just too bad. I did get some personal correspondence from a therapist in another state, who met with a physician with extensive laser experience, and that person said lasers shouldn't be used within 6 months of radiation. (I'm about 2 months out...) Rian has no contra-indications--but intuitively that restriction makes sense to me. FYI: the Mass General PT, knew of therapists who used the laser, but didn't think it was appropriate for me. At this point. This is what I heard from Rian when I asked for data: Attached please find what additional studies I can offer you. The clinical study you refer to is the best science to date on this device/modality. LLLT has been used for years outside of the US , but as you know, most the rest of the world operates without as much focus on rigorous clinical studies. The manufacture is in Australia and they have no plans for further clinical studies. Well, we learn from each other, and I can only hope that clinics in the US who use it will follow women and report on their experiences. Kira ",

We're both doctors, and used to work together, which can make for an odd doctor/patient relationship. I was the one to call the radiation oncologist, and plastic surgeon, and pull the doctor card to get some immediate information. I told her that ironically, I trained in Pittsburgh with Bernie Fischer, the pioneer of breast conserving surgery. We discussed that there is sort of a bias toward breast conserving surgery right now--even the Mayo Clinic website sort of says, if your surgeon pushes mastectomy, consider another surgeon. I realize that I'm being asked to make a decision before all the information can be available--I won't know the node status until post-op. I'm meeting with the radiation oncologist for a consult with myself and my husband tomorrow. Right at this moment, I'm strongly considering lumpectomy with SNB, and decide re: mastectomy after all the node status and need for chemo are available. A truly informed decision can only be made when you have the entire picture. Thank you for the site on reconstruction--it made me realize that I'm not interested in it at this point, and possibly ever, and I need to make that clear to the breast surgeon. I have two days to rest and recover and process, and I thank everyone for their help and support.

She'll call me Thursday night with the recommendations from the tumor board who will have the ER/PR/Her status. The surgery will be done with sentinel node.

I also can't wear my wedding rings, and that bugs me. I see a common thread here, that hands are tough! And we use them all the time, and need them. Just to put things in perspective: I saw a woman today with a monstrous arm after mastectomy and radiation, who was hospitalized for a severe cellulitis, and no one referred her for LE therapy! I told her I wouldn't get on my soap box as I wrote out the therapy referral, but I did say that it's overlooked, undertreated and generally neglected. LE sucks. But lots of other things stink too. It's collateral damage of our treatment and we all too often have to fight to get recognition and care. But we're tough, and we can manage this. Binney and I have noted that a LE flare causes emotional distress, and we think it's a physical response, beyond just the emotions. I had a rough day at work, and it's getting warmer, and I didn't have any chance to put on my glove during the day, and now I'll have to work extra hard for that. We support each other, and educate each other, and we need to celebrate our successes and problem solve our issues with the support of each other. And we have the right to be distressed by it: it's real.   Kira ",

Was she trained in a 135 hour program, LANA certified? Is she a PT/OT/ massage therapist? Here's a page on LE therapists http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm A lot of therapists won't touch you while you're getting radiation. They shouldn't massage the skin where you are getting radiation, but they can massage your arm, abdomen and back. I understand the concept of watersheds--the midsection--but during radiation, you may not be able to tolerate compression garments on your skin. On this page, there are diagrams of the lymphatic system, and you'll see the watersheds--when lymph is \"stuck\" due to blockage/impaired drainage, you try to move it to another drainage area--over the watershed http://www.stepup-speakout.org/manual_lymphatic_drainage_massage_lymphedema.htm  Most LE treatment starts with intensive--but some therapists won't do it during radiation--where they massage and put you in compression bandages/wrapping, and bring down the swelling, and then, once it's stable, they fit you for garments for day--compression sleeve/gauntlet/glove and night--if needed. Things can be unstable during radiation, so some therapists just try and keep you under control until you're through. I don't like her comment about touching radiation--I had a massage therapist refuse to touch me while I was getting it--like I was radioactive. I was looking at a thread today, and saw a picture of your baby--he's gorgeous. Your \"treatment buddy\",and your older son.  I asked Binney, the ultimate expert to look at this, but I think you should check out the therapist's credentials, and even if she has good ones, if she's strange and not making you comfortable, then she may not be the person to help you through this.

But, you can do it, and you were on top of things enough to figure out that you needed measurments--too bad they weren't done at every visit. My belief is that lymphedema therapsits should give you all the tools: learn skin care, self-massage, how to wrap, get compression garments and then you move into \"maintenance\" phase where you have to manage it yourself--and that's challenging. You'll find women on these boards who only need compression for exercising, and others who must wear it every day so things stay under control. Women who wrap or use a special night garment at night, and women who only use night wrapping/garments when they flare. Lymphedema is a dynamic process and our needs change. The key is having the tools, and a good support system to manage it. I have been known to call my LE therapist at home for all sorts of things: she encourages it, and in the first year, the calls were frequent. Once, I went to a meditation retreat, sat with my wrists clasped for hours, and come home with new swelling at the wrist--instant freak out and call to my wonderful therapist.  Now, the calls are just to confirm appointments. Most medical systems send you to a PT/OT who does the acute management, and tends to then send you on your way.  This is a CHRONIC condition, managed by PT/OT's without much physician support--although you mentioned a LE nurse (are you in the UK? Nurses can't do LE therapy here--they don't get paid.) But, in an ideal world, you'd check in periodically to measure and discuss how maintenance is going. I find that at the beginning, you tend to use all of your tools, and as time goes on, you discover what you need to do. There is no \"one size fits all\"---it's a dynamic process and it changes with the weather/food/hormones/stress and we need to adjust what we do to manage it. Sorry you joined our group, but you'll find some amazing women here, and you can do this.  We're here to help. Kira",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2013 05:22PM kira wrote: From Family Practice News: the lower dose of radiation, hypofractionation, as done in the UK and Canada, causes less RIBP An article from Family Practice News AN ANTONIO \u2013 A lower-dose, briefer radiotherapy regimen than is standard for early-stage breast cancer in the U.S. demonstrated comparable efficacy with fewer side effects at 10 years of follow-up in a pair of landmark U.K. studies.\"Long-term follow-up confirms that a lower total dose of radiation in fewer, slightly larger fractions delivered over a shorter treatment time is at least as safe and effective as standard 5-week schedules of curative radiotherapy in women with early breast cancer,\" Dr. John R. Yarnold declared in presenting the latest data from the U.K. START (Standardization of Breast Radiotherapy) trials at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Dr. John R. Yarnold The historical standard of care for radiotherapy in patients with surgically excised early breast cancer is 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy each over the course of 5 weeks. That\u2019s still standard practice in the United States. In the United Kingdom, however, the standard nationwide is 40 Gy in 15 fractions of 2.67 Gy over 3 weeks. Radiologists term this \"hypofractionation\": delivering a lower total dose of radiation using fewer but larger fractions. Hypofractionation has standard practice in the United Kingdom since the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence\u2013issued guidelines to that effect in 2009. Those guidelines were based in large part on the earlier, highly favorable 5-year outcomes of START A (Lancet Oncology 2008;9:331-41) and START B (Lancet 2008;371:1098-107). The START investigators deemed it essential to conduct the new 10-year analysis because adverse effects of radiotherapy given for breast cancer can arise after the 5-year mark. Also, it was important to learn whether the early antitumor effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy persisted, explained Dr. Yarnold, professor of clinical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research, London. The two key findings at the 10-year mark of START are, first, that both breast cancer and the dose-limiting normal tissues respond similarly to fraction size, so there\u2019s no advantage in continuing the 2 Gy fractions that have historically been the international standard; and, second, that a 15-fraction/3-week schedule is gentler on normal tissues and comparable in antitumor efficacy to a 25-fraction/5-week regimen. The clinical implications are clear, Dr. Yarnold emphasized: \"Patients can safely be treated to a lower total dose with fewer fractions than the historical standard of 50 Gy and 25 fractions. There are no detrimental effects of hypofractionation noted in any of the subgroups studied.\" The 10-year rate of moderate to marked adverse treatment effects on normal tissues in START A survivors who received 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks was 43.9% compared with 50.4% in those randomized to 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. The resultant 20% relative risk reduction with a lower total radiation dose delivered in fewer fractions was statistically significant. In contrast, the 10-year locoregional tumor relapse rates in the two groups were similarly low. At 10 years in START B, patients who received 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks had a 37.9% rate of moderate-to-marked adverse effects on normal tissues, compared with a 45.3% rate in those who got 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, for a highly significant 23% risk reduction. The relapse rate was 4.3% after 40 Gy and 5.5% after 50 Gy, a nonsignificant difference. In both trials, all types of side effects involving normal tissues were significantly less common in the lower-total-dose, fewer-fraction groups. That includes brachial plexus injury, which has been a concern expressed by supporters of the historical standard regimen, Dr. Yarnold added. Radiologists and surgeons in the audience called the 10-year START results \"very, very important\" and likely to be practice changing. Canada has already switched from the historical standard to 42.5 Gy delivered in 16 fractions over the course of 22 days. Asked if he thinks U.S. radiologists, too, should change their practice in light of the START findings, Dr. Yarnold was diplomatic. \"I foresee no scientific reasons why they should not consider that very carefully,\" he replied. Follow-up will continue in the START trials, which are funded by the Institute for Cancer Research, Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council, and the National Cancer Research Institute. Dr. Yarnold reported having no financial conflicts.",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2010 02:25PM kira wrote: That article has caused so much misinformation, that the National Lymphedema Network had the author publish a clarification: weight lifting does NOT cure LE, reduce LE, and only reduced the perception of flares--in a group of carefully selected women who wore special garments and had personal trainers. http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/Weight_LE_Misconception.pdf Have your friend give this to her doctor: Weight Lifting and Lymphedema: Clearing up Misconceptions Written by Kathryn Schmitz, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor University of Pennsylvania The purpose of this article is to clarify what the PAL trial results do and do not mean and to clarify how women with lymphedema should interpret the results for their own situation. In August 2009, results of a large randomized controlled trial called the Physical Activity and Lymphedema or \u2018PAL\u2019 trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The results indicated that slowly progressive weight training with no upper limit on the amount of weight lifted did not worsen swelling for women with breast cancer related lymphedema. Further, women in the weight-lifting group had half as many \u2018flare-ups\u2019 of their lymphedema that required therapist delivered intensive complete decongestive therapy, and that the number and severity of lymphedema symptoms were reduced by weight lifting. This is exciting news! There was a large amount of media attention to the results, given that they run counter to what women had been told for decades, including prior versions of exercise guidelines from the National Lymphedema Network (NLN). Most women are told not to lift anything heavier than 5-15 pounds ever again with their affected limb to avoid worsening of lymphedema once they are diagnosed. The results of the PAL trial indicated that the guidance may not be accurate. However, not all of the media accounts of the PAL trial results were complete and, as a result, it has come to the attention of the leaders in the field of lymphedema clinical care that there are some misconceptions that require clarification. Though this article is written by the principal investigator of the PAL trial, it has been vetted and approved by the NLN Medical Advisory Committee as well. Overall, the Medical Advisory Committee agrees that exercise is important and can be accomplished safely. However, lymphedema patients should not be cavalier about progressive weight-lifting. Patients should be mindful of the proper guidelines and should avoid rushing into weight-lifting without following some key safety guidelines (see below). Slow and steady is the way to go. It is important for patients to know their own body and how it responds; not to ignore signs of a possible exacerbation of swelling; to know what to do if there are signs of swelling or increased swelling, and to seek care from a certified lymphedema therapist when/if those signs occur. Below we clarify some of the misconceptions that seem to have arisen based on media attention to the PAL trial results. Misconception #1: Weight Training Prevents Lymphedema WRONG! The PAL trial paper published in August 2009 did not address prevention of lymphedema. There is no evidence that weight training prevents lymphedema. Women with lymphedema should not be told that they could have prevented their condition by weight-lifting. That is a boldly inaccurate statement, not supported by the results of the PAL trial. There is a second paper that will be published from the PAL trial about the results in the 154 women in the study who did NOT have lymphedema. This separate paper will comment on prevention. Stay tuned. Misconception #2: If weight-lifting is safe, and all those years we told women not to weightlift, then all those other cautions like avoiding blood pressure or blood draws on the affected side must be wrong too. WRONG! Nothing from this study should be interpreted as commenting on any other risk reduction guidelines beyond those related to exercise with weights. When lymph nodes are removed, the part of the body that was served by those lymph nodes is forever altered with regard to responding to infection, inflammation, injury, and trauma. The NLN Position Paper on Risk Reduction Practices (2008) recommended by the NLN Medical Advisory Committee were developed to assist women with avoiding infection, inflammation, injury, and trauma. Regardless of whether women do weight-lifting or not, or whether they have lymphedema or not, if lymph nodes have been removed, those guidelines are meant to prevent onset and worsening of lymphedema and are still applicable. Misconception #3: The study results mean that all women with lymphedema can buy weights or a gym membership and do what they want without fear of their lymphedema getting worse. WRONG! The intervention was done in a controlled way. There are a number of features of the study that were too detailed for the media reports. Here are some key safety features that were left out of the articles in the popular media, such as CBS World News Tonight, Time Magazine, USA Today, and the New York Times. 1. Lymphedema should be STABLE prior to starting weight-lifting. This means that there should have been no cellulitic infections that required antibiotics over the past three months and no more than 1 \u2018flare-up\u2019 that required therapist delivered decongestive therapy in the past three months. Further, all of the women in the study had had no fluctuations in their arm volume for the past three months that were larger than 10%. Thankfully, most women who have lymphedema are stable, and most lymphedema is mild. There were only a handful of women who were not included in the study because they did not have stable lymphedema, and that was because we were at the end of the recruitment period for the study and could not wait for them to become stable. If your arm is not stable, as defined above, wait until it is to start weight-lifting. 2. Read and understand the following NLN Position Papers: Lymphedema Risk Reduction Practices, Exercise, Treatment, and Training of Therapists BEFORE starting weightlifting, so that you can know what to look for and how to respond if you have a change in swelling or symptoms. All of the women in the PAL trial were required to attend a lymphedema education session that reviewed this material at the beginning of the study. 3. A well-fitted custom compression garment should be worn during all upper body weightlifting exercises. Women in the PAL trial wore a sleeve and glove that came to the fingertips. The women took them off at the end of the session to complete stretches and shower, then re-donned them after the session if they wore a sleeve all day. The compression garments should be replaced every 6 months. 4. The upper body exercises should be started in a supervised setting, at low resistance, with someone who has training as a certified cancer exercise trainer (a certification offered through the American College of Sports Medicine) or training as a Certified Lymphedema Therapist. If the exercises are done with dumbbells, start with 1 to 3 lb dumbbells. If the exercises are done with machines, start with the lightest possible weight. 5. Only progress to a higher weight after 2-4 sessions of doing the exercise with proper form (e.g., with a certified fitness professional or physical therapist watching and guiding to be sure that the movements are done correctly). Progressing to a higher weight should only occur if there have been NO CHANGES in the lymphedema symptoms. 6. If there is a change in symptoms that lasts a week or longer, stop doing upper body weight-lifting until you can get evaluated by a certified lymphedema therapist to be sure that there is not an exacerbation that requires treatment. You may continue lower body weight-lifting and aerobic exercise with the lower body during this time. 7. If you take a break from exercising that lasts a week or longer, regardless of the reason (e.g., vacation, illness, caring for a sick family member, work), back off on the weight lifted in the weight-lifting exercises. If you take a break that lasts 1 month or longer, start over with 1 to 3 lb weights and rebuild from there. IRREGULAR ATTENDANCE AT EXERCISE SESSIONS WAS THE HYPOTHESIZED CAUSE OF INJURY AND LYMPHEDEMA EXACERBATIONS FROM THE PAL TRIAL. IF YOU CANNOT DO WEIGHT-LIFTING TWO TIMES WEEKLY ON A REGULAR BASIS, IT IS LIKELY BETTER NOT TO DO IT AT ALL. THE WOMEN WITH IRREGULAR ATTENDANCE WERE MORE LIKELY TO GET INJURED OVERALL, NOT JUST TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH LYMPHEDEMA. Misconception #4. If I do weight-lifting, I will never have another exacerbation. WRONG. There were women in the PAL trial who experienced exacerbations due to weight-lifting. Most of them did not follow the safety guidelines noted above. That\u2019s how we developed the safety guidelines noted above. Safety guidelines that were broken most often in the PAL trial were to have regular attendance and to back off on the weight if you take a week or longer off from exercise. Misconception #5. If it is safe for me to do weight-lifting, then it is okay for me to lift heavy things at work or at home. My boss can ask me to lift heavy things at work now because the PAL trial results show it is safe for me to do so. WRONG! The PAL intervention started upper body exercise with 1 lb dumbbells. Some women never progressed beyond 5 lb dumbbells on any exercise. Other women were able to progress to bench pressing 85 lbs. or more. Results will vary by prior fitness level and individual lymphedema and medical condition. Employers who use the PAL trial results as evidence that it is safe to have employees with lymphedema lift heavy objects are blatantly mis-interpreting the study results. If a woman starts weight-training at 1 to 3 lbs, increases gradually over time, and experiences no negative effects from weight-lifting, her ability to safely lift heavy things at work and at home will gradually increase. The difficulty in translating the strength gains in the gym to strength gains at work and home is that we know how heavy the weights are, while we do NOT know how heavy a specific object at home or work might be. Caution is urged among women who do weight-lifting not to misjudge their new strength and inadvertently cause inflammation or injury in the affected arm by lifting something too heavy. That said, it does seem likely that after progressive weight-lifting, the likelihood that common daily activities will result in lymphedema exacerbations is significantly reduced. If an employer wants an employee with lymphedema to be able to lift heavy objects on a regular basis, the employer needs to provide free access to the certified lymphedema therapist to verify it is safe for the woman to engage in weight-lifting, free custom-fitted compression garments, free time with a certified fitness professional and/or physical therapist to learn how to do the exercises safely, free access to a fitness facility with adequate machines and weights, and paid time off work to do this training. Without these provisions, it would be inappropriate for employers to require employees with lymphedema to do heavy lifting. Misconception #6: The PAL trial results mean it is safe for those with LOWER EXTREMITY lymphedema to do weight-lifting too. The PAL investigation team has tried a pilot study to find out whether it is safe for those with lower extremity lymphedema to do weight-lifting. The results are quite inconclusive and funding has been sought to further investigate the safety of weight-lifting in patients with lower limb lymphedema. It is not appropriate, at this time, to extrapolate the results of the PAL trial to those with lower extremity lymphedema. ",

I met her at a Vodder recertification course and this kind, gentle woman gave a lecture starting out with how she was told not worry about LE and developed it within months....and then told us how she's followed over 250 women for nearly a decade, and that's just one of her studies.  This ALFP project is huge, and she does it with grace and kindness. So rare in academia and we need her so much. Kira",

They are releasing chapters as they get published in reputable medical journals. Here's a press release from her University, notice the realistic comments--Jane is on the LE wall of heros for for infinite kindness, incredible hard work, brilliance and wonderful research. I have had the good fortune to meet her several times, and each time I'm more impressed: http://www.healthcanal.com/cancers/23982-Researchers-Recommend-Exercise-for-Breast-Cancer-Survivors-Lymphedema-Patients.html COLUMBIA, Mo. - Lymphedema, a chronic swelling condition common in breast cancer survivors, affects three million people in the U.S. In the past, most people believed that exercise might induce or worsen lymphedema. After reviewing the literature, University of Missouri researchers say the benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for breast cancer survivors and patients with lymphedema. Jane Armer, professor in the Sinclair School of Nursing, says patients at risk for lymphedema can exercise if they closely monitor their activities. \"Exercise can be beneficial and not harmful for breast cancer survivors,\" Armer said. \"Each individual should balance the pros and cons of the activity she chooses, but keep in mind that being sedentary has risks and being active is beneficial in many ways, including possibly reducing the risk of cancer recurrence.\" Lymphedema can occur any time after cancer treatment and is usually caused by the removal or radiation of lymph nodes as part of the treatment process. Armer found that patients who exercise had no greater risk for developing lymphedema than those who do not exercise. In addition, patients with lymphedema did not worsen their condition by exercising. She says future research is needed to determine whether exercise prevents the condition. \"Breast cancer survivors do not need to restrict their activity as we once thought,\" Armer said. \"If patients want to be active, they should carefully condition their bodies by increasing repetitions of resistance exercises under proper supervision.\" In another new literature review, Armer and her colleagues examined published literature pertaining to the surgical treatment of lymphedema. They found that in most studies surgery did not eliminate the need for traditional compression garments in patients with lymphedema. \"Many people think surgery will correct the underlying lymphatic problem, but that is not correct,\" Armer said. \"There are several surgical techniques that may reduce the swelling associated with lymphedema. In most cases, it is recommended that patients undergo traditional therapy using specialized massage and compression garments and bandages to reduce fluid and swelling before considering surgery.\" The literature reviews were the first two in a series of thirteen reviews to be published in conjunction with the American Lymphedema Framework Project (ALFP). Established in 2008, the ALFP aims to increase awareness of lymphedema, improve patient care and enhance training for professionals caring for persons at risk or with cancer-related lymphedema. The ALFP has two main goals: maintain up-to-date best practices supported with evidence-based lymphedema treatment guidelines for health practitioners, and create a minimum data set of all available lymphedema research and clinical data. The first article, \"Exercise in patients with lymphedema: A systematic review of the contemporary literature,\" was published in the Journal of Cancer Survivorship. The second, \"The surgical treatment of lymphedema: A systematic review of the contemporary literature,\" was published in Annals of Surgical Oncology. I'll get ahold of the articles--good timing after the Arkansas surgeon who proclaims surgery as the only permanent cure for LE.

I sent myself to the lymphedema clinic at the Breast Health Center when I developed axillary web syndrome 10 days post op--essentially it's cording due to the trauma of surgery and is due to thrombosed lymph vessels. I was put on the schedule of a qualified therapist--Vodder trained, 15 years experience, but we didn't communicate at all. She gave me handouts on self massage--but never taught me--all I know about it is from watching JoAnn Rovig on line.   After a week, I got a bug bite and developed swelling of my hand, so I now have some lymphedema. Her response was to bandage me so tightly that my hands turned blue and give me a handout to do it myself. No teaching, ever. Her plan was a weekly massage and tight bandage for 24 hours. I took the bandages off after a couple of hours due to pain. The second week, she didn't wrap my fingers, and all the swelling moved to the top of my hand--creating \"Mickey Mouse pod hand\"--very upsetting.   She ordered me a compression sleeve and glove (based on measurements before I developed any swelling), and they caused my fingers to turn blue immediately, and the DME person who has less than a year experience, and didn't know what to do.    The clinic director, who is not a therapist, yet lectures nationally, switched me to another qualified therapist (because I called her because my compression sleeve couldn't be found and the therapist had no contact info for the DME provider) who met with me and told me I could not have lymphedema because my measurements are equal--my hand swelling didn't impress him. He told me that lymphedema ALWAYS starts in the upper arm.  So, Binney has been patiently returning my PM's and advising me. Also, JoAnn Rovig, has sent some helpful emails.   I have been bandaging the hand swelling each night, but other than my prior experience with putting on casts for fractures, I have no idea what I'm doing. I do MLD twice a day--again, who knows if my technique is right? I have a minimal handout and watched the on-line self care video. I have an OTC jobst sleeve and gauntlet, but haven't worn them, because no one has told me when I should. The first sleeve and glove were too tight in the arm, and immediately made my hand swell along with the usual purple/blue painful fingers. As I wrote to Binney, I think the key is not to cut off the arterial flow at my wrist...   The position statement from the NLN specifically mentions that compression should not cause a tourniquet effect. I brought that in, along with other information, but the therapist didn't look at them. I sent her an email with web links--but she didn't read them.   So, with Binney's guidance, I have just found a therapist who is well trained and in private practice and I will start with her. Also, per JoAnn Rovig's guidance, I'm working with a DME person who is very knowledgable to get an open fingered glove, to replace the night bandages. The new therapist thinks that's a great idea.   It's been a very frustrating experience for me, as well as discouraging.   The experience that swimangel describes is what I would have wanted.   I hope that the new therapist can help me get this minimal, but persistent hand swelling under control. The good news is that my webbing is softening, and I did see a PT for exercises. She used to work at the lymphedema clinic but left and there's residual hard feelings between the two centers. I think I understand her frustration and anger, but as a patient, I didn't appreciate getting caught in the middle.   So, the new therapist wants to spend a session on training me on self massage, another on bandaging, and work on me as needed. It sounds like a plan.   Binney has been a life saver---patiently answering my frantic cries for help. As Binney mentioned, a therapist should be open to new ideas, and this new person welcomed some articles on axillary web syndrome that I sent her. The clinic director, who had never heard of axillary web syndrome, never read them....   So, I'm cautiously helpful and I agree that education is key and early intervention is crucial. I'm hoping I get some of that soon.   And, to add insult to injury, I discovered that they bill their services at $360/hour because of the \"high level of care\". I wouldn't resent the charge if it accurately reflected the services rendered. I previously got massages from a well trained massage therapist, who has also been begging me to change (she's afraid to touch me right now) and her fee was far less and I got a high level of care. The new therapist won't accept insurance, and her fee is considerably less. I can submit as an out of network provider and the copay will likely be the same or less.  Kira ",

I've never heard of a \"new method\" that recommends deeper massage. I think the proof is in the results. JoAnn Rovig has a series of on-line videos--and yes, she does demonstrate over her clother, and she only shows the \"sweep\" stroke, but she talks about the superficial lymphatics and how you could damage them with too much pressure. You only want to move the skin, not muscle, and never cause redness Here's the link to the Nortwest LE center self-care videos www.nwlymphedemacenter.org/ You can be too hard, very difficult to be too soft. I had a \"weekend wonder\" therapist knead me like bread dough: I was out of there after a session. Good for you to question her--now, Il'd let her know that her new method doesn't work, or just avoid her. Kira",

If I use night garments--which are chipped foam, I will have red marks on my skin--indentations, but they fade quickly. If I wrap, no skin marks at all. So, the biggest worry is an infection, and the second worry is an allergic reaction which could cause swelling and itching, and potentially lead to an infection. Some therapists use lotions, and personally, I use a lotion called vanicream that has no fragrance or parabens in it (you can get it at Walgreens.) www.psico.com/ I'm going to put in a link for cellulitis www.stepup-speakout.org/Emerge... If you scroll through LindaLou's thread of pictures of lymphedema, I believe there's a photo of how here arm looks after using a night garment--but again, they're chipped foam, not the smooth roll of a wrap. It's wonderful that you reduced your arm, and hopefully this gets resolved quickly ( and do push the issue, it's very important for you) so you can move on to the next stage in managing this. Kira",

I did find a reference on another site that said if the compression is too tight and functions like a tourniquet it can cause damage.   I completely understand your comment about the nausea: during the two-four hours I was in the too tight bandages, I paced the house, couldn't get comfortable, and couldn't eat dinner. In those long (but I think very worthwhile classes) they talk about the superficial lymphatics: 40% of the lymph system being very delicate--I can attest to the fact that you don't see them in cadavers (I did gross anatomy in medical school)--and they have these tiny gills that are easily damaged and don't tend to re-grow.   I've kind of decided to listen to my body. Manual lymph drainage feels good, and my hand/wrist are less swollen. Tourniquet dressings leave me ill and I think may do permanent damage.   I completely relate to your frustration--I was getting pretty and angry and discouraged. The day after my surgery, I half slept through Spaceballs--the Movie, and woke to a scene where Rick Moranis shouts out (because half his crew are incompetent and have the last name a##hole): \"I'm surrounded by a##holes!\" I quoted that to my husband yesterday when I was getting so upset. Finding those great classes on line, with their positive attitude and information was really helpful for me. I'd like to see what Binney thinks of them.   Go with your instinct: Binney wrote on my post that she had issues with compression and had to modify it, and that sounds so right. Kira ",

It takes a lot of teaching to learn how to wrap well, and re-education periodically.   The treatment plan for LE should always be in flux, as we are: so sometimes you can get away with just periodic compression wear, or just MLD and sometimes you need to add more. That's why a good LE therapist is so important--and that you can check back in.   LE can progress, but as the article that Otter posted indicated, the people who respond the best are those who are caught early.   I've had flares: fluid moved up to my forearm and totally freaked me out, because I immediately decided it was progressing and would never stop---and then with the help of my therapist, and ironically, figuring out that I was wrapping to tightly, it got better. It's a learning curve, and we're here to help.

I start with the upper arm, clear the nodes at the elbow, do the lower arm, then hand,--upper and lower side. I saw a new PT/LMT a few months ago, and she recommended doing the arm while lying on your good side. She had me do it by feel and when I do the underside of the arm, when I get to the elbow, I bend it and then work the fluid down to the arm pit and then work down the side. She was also big on \"reintegrating\" the breast--massaging it and bringing everything down the side to the inguinals. So, first I do it while I can see it, and then lay down and finish it up again. It is SO normal to get depressed about this. For garments, you wear compression garments during the day, but either wraps/bandages or specially made night garments at night. Some people don't swell at night, and don't need it. My weak spot is that I don't feel comfortable wearing my glove at work--something I need to overcome for many reasons. I do usually get away with it, but sometimes I know my hand would be in better shape if I wore a glove at work. I see patients, and wash my hands, and just don't see how it would work. It would work just fine while I'm doing paperwork. For Shana, here's a link to axillary web/cording: www.stepup-speakout.org/Cordin...  Elaine, it's really hopeful to hear that you got things under control. You're not stubborn, IMO, you're brave. One last thing about massage: different therapists teach different techniques--the sweep--a long slow stroke, stationary circles--a static half circle with light pressure and release the skin at the end, and the pull/release--gently pull the skin and then release. Binney has noted that we all tend to use a bit to heavy of a hand when we're frustrated. Gentle as stroking a kitten or puppy. Hang in there. Kira ",

Drugs for cellulitis vary, Levaquin is a quinolone (like Cipro)--but unllike cipro it  covers\" gram positives\" (bacteria, usually staph or strep)  that tend to cause cellulitis. It's kind of \"big guns\". Some people need to use it due to allergies. It just went generic. The thing about quinolones is that they have very high blood levels--oral is as good as IV, but they have a lot of side effects as well.  Personally, as I'm allergic to keflex, I keep augmentin on hand. Bottom line for hope1 is that IMO you don't treat cellulitis over the phone--except maybe to get started, and it needs careful monitoring. Jinky, I think I heard about the link between infection and lymphatic damage at the NLN conference, I'll try and find references. Kira",

A few of us from this forum created a website to try and answer the questions: 1) the first is about how to treat lymphedema: since the vast majority of how you manage it will be self management, you need the \"tools\" to keep it under control--the therapists should teach you how to move the fluid out of the breast and arm--self manual lymph drainage--and it's a light massage, just moving the skin, they should give you well fitting compression garments for the chest and arm/hand and tell you when and how to use them, and address what to do if you swell at night--which involves special night garments and wrapping. You need the tools. Also what to do to reduce your risk of further swelling and getting an infection=cellulitis. And therapeutic exercises and exercise guidance for the future. A big task, but break it into managable bits and it can be done. Ask all the questions you need. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/treatments_for_lymphedema.htm 2) The special issue of breast/truncal lymphedema: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm 3) How to check out the credentials of your LE therapist: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm The issue of scars: lymph doesn't flow through a scar, but you can't undo the scars you have, although some scar massage can loosen them, what I believe they are referring to is fibrosis--when lymphatic fluid stagnates in the tissues, it causes inflammation and the tissue gets fibrotic and that's how lymphedema progresses. And you don't want it to progress. That's why early and good and thorough treatment leads to the best outcomes. Clear as mud? Please keep asking questions.",

So, in breast cancer, for example, it can appear in the arm on the same side as the cancer, after lymph nodes are removed from the armpit region for cancer staging. Lymph is the protein-rich body fluid that accumulates when the lymphatic system for fluid transport is damaged. Why is the lymphatic system important? Fluid transport is one very important component, but many do not realize that the lymphatic system is part of the immune system. It fulfills the function of \u2018immune trafficking,\u2019 the process whereby infection-fighting cells can be mobilized to the tissues that require assistance. When the lymphatic system is compromised by surgery, trauma, or improper development, the affected part of the body is prone to recurrent infection because of the faulty surveillance mechanism. Why is it that I was not warned about the risk of lymphedema prior to my surgery? Regrettably, many doctors are still very under-educated about the lymphatic system in general and, specifically, about the problem of lymphedema. Here at Stanford we\u2019re trying to rectify ignorance about lymphedema through specific educational initiative and I believe that nationally awareness is also increasing. Patients can also help their doctors to learn. Physicians must learn from their patients about their lymphedema experiences so that they will be better prepared to deal with their future patients. As a breast cancer survivor, what is my risk of getting lymphedema? Estimates vary and, fortunately, the risk has been progressively declining. In the beginning, breast cancer surgery carried a 50% risk of lymphedema development. Today, patients who have axillary lymph node dissection have a lifetime risk of 15-25%. For individuals whose surgery is limited to sentinel node techniques, without adjuvant radiation, the risk is about 6%. How does surgery affect my risk of lymphedema? The risk is chiefly aligned with lymph node removal. Individuals that have just lumpectomy, or other surgical interventions, are at such low risk that it is impossible to estimate. Sentinel node techniques, alone, are used in about 40% of current breast cancer patients. The sentinel node technique is defined as the removal of no more than four lymph nodes, where the risk is about 6%. If you have more than four lymph nodes removed, the risk rises to 15% to 25%. Does radiation increase the risk of lymphedema? Yes, radiation can traumatize the lymphatic system equivalently to surgery, even if surgery is not done. However, just as all surgery is not alike, not all radiation therapy is the same. In general, radiation therapy confers risk that is roughly equivalent to axillary lymph node dissection and increases the risk associated with surgery if both treatments are performed. If I have had lymph nodes removed under one arm, do I have to worry about the lymph nodes in other areas of my body? No. The lymphatic system is present throughout the body, but lymphedema is a regional disease that affects only the part of the body that is subjected to surgery or radiation. Do I have to worry about this for my whole life? The proper term to use is \u2018vigilance.' Stated positively, the primary risk for lymphedema development is in the first year following surgery and radiation therapy, when 90% of the cases occur. By the end of 3 years, 95% of the cases will have appeared. If you don\u2019t have lymphedema after 3 years of vigilance, the risk remains, but it is quite small. If you take the proper precautions and use the proper surveillance, the risk can be maintained as small as possible. What about exercise after cancer surgery? While, in the long run, exercise is very beneficial, it is very important to give your body adequate time for healing and to not push the exercise early on. This is not to say that patients shouldn\u2019t be very active at mobilizing the shoulder, because women are also prone to \u2018frozen shoulder\u2019 after a mastectomy. However, do not push the physical activity until the body is ready to do it. For the first three to four weeks, it is important to remain relatively inactive and, thereafter, to try to become progressively more active. And what about exercise during radiation therapy? There are similar concerns. One can expect a certain amount of inflammation related to the radiation, and it would be important to avoid over-taxing the lymphatic system. Accordingly, it is reasonable to \u2018take it easy\u2019 during radiation therapy. Should I be using my arm (or leg) for everyday activities? Yes, absolutely. Bear in mind, however, that physical activity increases blood flow, which increases the formation of lymph in the arm or leg at risk. You don\u2019t want to push the lymphatic system \u2018over the edge\u2019. Once you recognize your threshold for activity, you can gently extend your limits over time, perhaps, in addition, by using a Class I compression garment during activity that is perceived to be physically stressful. After surviving breast cancer surgery and chemotherapy, I\u2019ve developed lymphedema. I\u2019m angry that I have to go through the rest of my life with swelling, wearing a sleeve and restricting my activities. Is there anything you can suggest to help with that? The anger and the frustration are very understandable and very common. It seems like a second punishment after enduring so much to get your life back. Unfortunately, at this time, with current treatment techniques, the incidence of lymphedema breast cancer survivors remains at 15-25. There are no simple answers to this question. It is important to strive to keep life as normal as possible in the face of the fixed demands related to the presence of lymphedema. Seeking support from your fellow patients is also often a wonderful way to collectively share the experience and help to mitigate the anger. The ability to talk about the problem is an important step toward acceptance. Prior to my cancer diagnosis, I led a very active lifestyle. Now I am nervous that my former activities could cause lymphedema to emerge. What do you advise? My earnest advice is that once you are a cancer survivor, you must enjoy the gift of life. This means not placing boundaries on what your definition of being alive. It is true that there is a small, finite risk of lymphedema appearing for the first time in somebody at risk, or becoming worse in someone who already has it. However, with the appropriate precautions, those risks are quite small. It is very important, activity by activity, to weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio. There is some finite risk of lymphedema with activities like surfing rock climbing, to choose two random examples. But you have to weigh the importance to your life of those continuing experiences. With or without \u2018risky\u2019 activities appropriate treatment for lymphedema is essential when the lymphedema appears. It is very important to faithfully use the garment that is provided to you, particularly during the activity poses theoretical risk. It is very important to maintain surveillance for changes in the limb-at-risk. Take precautions against infection when there are breaks in the skin and seek medical attention early if any changes are observed. When you go outside, put on a sun block, because sunburn can aggravate lymphedema. When you are working in the kitchen, be careful. When you\u2019re in the garden, be careful, and wear gloves if there is the possibility of skin trauma. But what you want to lift, lift. What you want to do, do. And where you want to go, go. Just be careful. Falk Cardiovascular Research Center Stanford University School of Medicine 300 Pasteur Drive Stanford, California 94305-5406 Stanley G. Rockson, M.D., F.A.C.P., F.A.C.C.

I completely agree with you: I SO wish I could use the Solaris and wake up better, but it does make my arm and hand worse--so much worse--and even before the break, if I wore it, I would have to deal with the hand all day--and that's where my swelling is. Once, on my odyssey of PT's--I went to see a PT at a suburban branch of Mass General--and being totally hyper and on my own to manage my LE, I got a jovipak all by myself within a month of getting hand swelling (from a lacksidasical fitter who never checked the fit) and I was not improving. I had no real gloves. It was such a mess. Well, she walked in, took a look at my Jovipak, and and said \"Put it in your sock drawer!\" and proceeded to make me a custom wrap with foam cutouts. And it worked. It was just to elbow, and ultimately did cause a small pocket above the elbow, so now I wrap all the way up. Ultimately, she decided that because my swelling was all in my hand she couldn't justify (for insurance) any more visits and she discharged me, and got me the Solaris at the last visit, and actually wrote me that I had swelling \"but it wasn't lymphedema\"--Binney called her \"bizzaro\". But I do think her initial instinct was sound: \"Put it in your sock drawer\"--and she's British, so it's said with an accent. (think the queen and corgis...) Still can't believe I have a jovipak and a Solaris in my sock drawer--that's a lot of expensive foam. Kira",

Hands are tough. I have hand swelling. I think it's time to break it down and rexamine each component of your care: 1) The night garment: does it still fit well? Some aren't great on compressing the hands. At times like this, wrapping can give you the custom fit you may need, or you may need a new garment or to use a short stretch or pad over the problem areas. 2) Hand swelling: tough, tough, tough. The sleeve pushes fluid up and it's easy to trap fluid at the wrist. A good hand wrap helps a lot, but may not win the battle of \"gradient compression\" with the sleeve, and fluid goes to the lower pressure 3) Therapist input: is she doing MLD on you? There's a huge thread about garments as we all struggle with them. Personally, even with my pricey custom Juzo gloves, they trap fluid up by my knuckles. When my hand was at it's worse, I did a lot of hand wraps, stuck pads into the gloves, just experimented constantly and expensively. For me, night time wrapping is the key to daytime freedome from compression, and I have a closet full of jovipaks and Tributes that don't work all that well for me.... LE defies logic. And it sucks.

Be sure to read it carefully and fill in the blanks as necessary, customizing it to your specific situation. Have your physician sign and send it, retaining a copy for your records. Good luck and let us know how it goes! Date: [Date] To: Medical Affairs Appeals Dept. [Address] From: [Doctor], M.D. Subject: Physician Appeal of Denial of Coverage for [Name of Garment or Description of Bandage that was Denied] I am filing an appeal of an Administrative Adverse Decision on behalf of [Patient's Name] for the following adverse [Medical Provider] decision that is included as an attachment to this memorandum: Date: [Date] Re: [Patient's Name] Member Number: [Patient's Medical Number] Group: [Medical Group] Reference #: [Denial Letter] [Patient's Name] is under my care for chronic Lymphedema (LE) (ICD-9-CM 457.0/457.1/757.0) that causes severe swelling (and pain) in [his/her] [legs and feet/arm(s)/torso/groin]. I have referred [Patient's Name] for the approved treatment for [Patient's Name]'s diagnosed lymphedema to the [Name of Department, Clinic or Center]. This clinic is [Qualification of treatment center to which Patient was referred, e.g., \"nationally recognized and respected for treatment of LE and is under the leadership of \"John Doe, MD\", or \"staffed with therapists trained and certified in the Vodder (or Foeldi or Casley-Smith or LeDuc) method of lymphedema treatment.\"] The treatment for LE is officially known as Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT). As documented in the enclosed materials, CDT comprises a multi-phasic treatment program. One of the essential treatment modalities is the regular use of compression garments/bandages/devices, as compression is required in order to maintain the reduction of high protein edema achieved with Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). MLD, one of the components of CDT, is performed during the clinical treatment phase and, in a simplified form as a component of self-care in the home treatment phase. After the initial intensive program, patients must wear compression garments daily and compression bandages or non-elastic compression garments or devices nightly on the affected body areas. Although it does vary to some degree, individuals with lymphedema should not remove compression from the affected area for any extended period of time, particularly when they are engaging in any physical activity such as standing or walking, or while performing therapeutic exercises as part of CDT. The following enclosed medical journal articles describe the CDT standard treatment for LE: \"Workgroup III: Diagnosis and Management of Lymphedema\", Cancer, Vol. 83, No. 12, December 15, 1998, (Supplement), American Cancer Society Workshop on Breast Cancer Treatment-Related Lymphedema, New York, NY, February 20-22, 1997, pp. 2882-2885. International Society of Lymphology, Executive Committee: \"The Diagnosis and Treatment of Peripheral Lymphedema, 2009 Consensus Document of the International Society of Lymphology\", Lymphology, 2009; 42:51-60. NLN Medical Advisory Committee: \"Position Statement of the NLN. Topic: The Diagnostic and Treatment [of Lymphedema]\" February, 2011. Compression bandages, compression devices and compression garments are an integral part of the treatment for LE. Unless [Patient's Name]'s coverage policy excludes treatment of Lymphedema, [Patient's Name] must be provided all parts of the CDT treatment. Compression garments, devices and bandages are particularly important during the self-treatment phase following clinical treatment. As cited in the medical literature, if left untreated, LE may result in several severe consequences, including fibrosis, joint immobility, amputation and life-threatening infections that may require repeated hospitalizations for intensive intravenous antibiotic therapy. Failure to provide [Patient's Name] with proper treatment, including compression garments, devices and bandages, predisposes him or her to these serious consequences. (Prior to being sent to the [Referred Treatment Center], [Patient's Name] experienced several onsets of lymphangitis/cellulitis, a severe infection resulting from his/her LE disease, requiring multiple extended hospitalizations.) [Include specific dates and treatment details] Based on the available medical literature on [Patient's Name]'s LE condition, I am filing this physician/health care provider appeal request, specifically requesting that you provide him/her with the required [Name of Garment or Description of Bandage that was Denied], as I personally prescribed, to treat [his/her] advanced Lymphedema condition. In addition, I would like to emphasize that coverage of necessary compression bandages and garments must be ongoing. Garments are worn during waking hours and bandages or non-elastic compression devices at night in order to maintain the affected limb. Due to this frequent wear and necessary laundering, garments and bandages have a limited life span. Therefore, each patient must have two sets of bandages and/or garments at all times, both of which must be replaced every six months. Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. Sincerely yours, [Physician's Name], M.D. Enclosures: [Description of Treatment Plan/Treatment Protocols, e.g.: Lymphedema-An Information Booklet by Saskia R. J.

      "Content": "kira wrote: This is concerning, the Vodder School is based in Canada, and I've heard from them that there are systemic attempts to \"prove\" that CDT is unneccesary, and now a study is published. I'll get the article and pick it apart. First it's a tiny study: they enrolled 106 women over the course of several years. http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/811611 Medscape Medical News > Oncology Try Compression Sleeves First for Early Lymphedema Fran Lowry Sep 25, 2013 Manual Drainage for Lymphedema Investigated in First-Ever RCT Breast Cancer News & Perspectives A trial that randomized women with early lymphedema to receive either complex decongestive therapy (CDT) or compression garments was unable to show that CDT is better than the more conservative, less expensive approach. Several cohort studies have suggested that CDT \u2014 which consists of manual lymphatic massage or drainage, daily bandaging, exercise, and skin care \u2014 is superior to compression sleeves for the treatment of lymphedema. However, a group of Canadian researchers who thought the evidence for such superiority was not good enough decided to conduct a randomized trial to find a definitive answer. \"I actually thought that our study was going to show that complex decongestive therapy was better, but, in fact, it didn't seem to be any more beneficial than elastic compression sleeves, which are much, much cheaper,\" said lead author Ian S. Dayes, MD, from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. The results were published online September 16 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. More Evidence to Start Conservatively Dr. Benjamin Anderson These results add to the mounting evidence against CDT as a first-line treatment for early lymphedema, write Sara H. Javid, MD, and Benjamin O. Anderson, MD, both from the University of Washington in Seattle, in an accompanying editorial. However, medical insurers should not take these results to mean that CDT is of no value and use them to justify not paying for the treatment, Dr. Anderson emphasized in an interview with Medscape Medical News. \"That is a very specific concern of mine, and is addressed in the editorial,\" he said. \"As the authors point out, CDT adds a significant cost beyond that of compression garments alone,\" the editorialists write. \"In the modern era of pay-for-performance, this study provides sound evidence that CDT should not be employed as a first-line therapy for those with early lymphedema. Because this study is likely to be cited by insurers as a rationale for denying payment for CDT lymphedema management, the limitations of the study should be clearly noted.\" Those limitations are that CDT was tested as a first-line treatment and was not tested in women with advanced disease who have longer-standing, more extensive, or progressive lymphedema. \"The women in the study were enrolled between 2003 and 2009 and their lymphedema was not advanced; it was early,\" Dr. Anderson explained. Study Results In the study, Dr. Dayes and his team enrolled 103 women from 6 centers who had been previously treated for breast cancer and who had lymphedema. The women, who had a minimum volume difference of 10% between their arms, were randomized to either CDT or compression sleeves. The primary outcome measure was the percent reduction in excess arm volume from baseline to 6 weeks. The mean reduction in excess arm volume with CDT was 29.0% and with compression sleeves was 22.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], \u20136.8% to 20.5%; P = .34). Absolute volume loss was greater with CDT than with compression sleeves (250 vs 143 mL; 95% CI, 13 to 203; P = .03). However, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of patients who lost 50% or more of their excess arm volume. In addition, quality of life, measured with the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and arm function were similar in the 2 groups. \"I would like for patients and caregivers to recognize that massage-based treatments should not be the first line of treatment, which I think has been the case,\" Dr. Dayes noted. \"Despite the fact that a couple of previous randomized trials showed a lack of benefit, people were still recommending massage-based treatments for patients with lymphedema,\" he told Medscape Medical News. \"I think it's probably in the patient's best interest to realize that the benefit really wasn't there, or rather that the benefit is no greater, or marginally greater, than an elastic sleeve.

During the busy summer rush, talk with parents about the importance of adolescent vaccination Learn what parents may want to know Information from Industry Dr. Anderson, who is a breast surgeon, explained that lymphedema has become a major concern because it has been neglected for so long. \"In the 1980s, we surgeons really didn't pay attention to lymphedema because we thought it was incurable. In those days, when complete axillary lymph node dissection was the only option, and when physical therapy techniques were not well accepted or established, we largely ignored this problem,\" he said. \"It was the patient community that raised awareness that there are things that can be done, and they can be effective,\" Dr. Anderson pointed out. \"The fact that people are concerned about this, in part, has to do with the fact that we did not do a good job in the past. We're doing much better in terms of paying attention and trying to identify the best treatment strategies. I think this research into the best treatment is part of our trying to correct that.\" Dr. Dayes and Dr. Anderson have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

I am STAR certified, and personally, I found the course to be overpriced (my tuition was covered by a grant) and the lack of a reference text was a significant drawback. It consists of 13 or so on-line chapters with pre and post tests. Some of the information is inaccurate, especially the lymphedema chapter. But, it raises awareness. When you're done, you get a certificate, but no reference texts or ability to use the fatigue scales or access the articles that were referenced. I'm not a big fan of the MD who sells the course: Julie Silver MD--I wish she'd put up accurate information and provide those of us who took the course with a reference that we could use as we work with patients. Here's the site: http://www.oncologyrehabpartners.com/  And Julie Silver is working overtime to promote her course and certification, but doesn't do much work with patients....She also runs expensive courses on how to get published: she published two books about her cancer and rehab experience. Too bad she puts more energy into promotion over accurate content and a course that translated into better quality care. I just found it raised awareness of long term side effects. For those who may not have known. That little rant aside, I'm really glad your OT is helping you. I saw a number of PTs and one OT, and didn't get full relief until I went to a massage therapist for myofascial work--this is nearly 5 years out. At the start, the last PT, who was also a LMT, did a good job. And they did get a whole lot better just with time. But some cords lingered.",

There are a lot of PT's out there that are well trained, but are clueless. My analogy to CLT training is that you're like an intern when you're done, but you really need a residency to be competent. Dismissing you based on her mistaken assumption that you couldn't have LE with \"just\" a SNB is ridiculous. Here is an overview of average rates of LE--although he doesn't address the major impact of mastectomy which removes a lot of nodes within the breast, and the \"tail of Spence\"-- with the various treatments from Stanley Rockson MD of Stanford, and some of us have weaker lymphatic systems and will get LE much more easily: hehttp://lymphaticnetwork.org/living-with-lymphatic-disease/you-and-lymphedema/ Here is an overview of the prevelance by Carol--your situation presents a 3-23% risk:  http://www.lymphedemablog.com/2012/09/08/the-risk-of-breast-cancer-related-lymphedema-over-time/ And from bc.org--Andrea Cheville from Mayo Clinic on the diagnosis of LE:  http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/lymphedema/evaluation/diagnosis According to Andrea Cheville, MD, associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mayo Clinic, it\u2019s important to look at the whole picture: not just size and volume measurements, but the appearance of the limb or other body part. \u201cThere is no one value or standard you can use to say, \u2018OK, if you meet that you have lymphedema, and if you don\u2019t, well then you don\u2019t have it,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Cheville. \u201cFor example, there may be no size or volume changes in the arm, but you could have subtle hand swelling or pitting on the arm. So it\u2019s important not to be too locked into arm measurements alone, as that can create a false sense of security. You also need to be watching the arm and looking for the loss of what we call \u2018anatomic architecture\u2019 \u2014 an inability to see the veins and tendons in the arm as clearly, or less pronounced knuckles, or skin that is less wrinkled and therefore looks younger.\u201d So, for the PT not to examine you is substandard. For the PT to do MLD that is painful is flat out wrong. If there were licensure credentials for a LE PT, that PT should lose her license.  Manipulating your back has no place in LE treatment or assessment. None. If you wake in the the night with hand swelling, you have LE. And it needs to be treated by a good therapist. I went through several, and I'd urge you to keep trusting yourself and dismissing ignorant PT's who can actually harm you with their treatment and leave you without the full spectrum of care and tools that you need to manage your LE. Training doesn't guarantee excellence, but here's a way to check on the training of the PT/OT who is treating you--and there are a lot of excellent LMT's out there, who can't take insurance, but are well trained. That's who I see for my LE. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Kira  ",

I am a certified lymphedema therapist who also owns a lymphedema treatment center. We are an evidence-based practice. I have seen no empirical studies that suggest that SNB procedures have little to no risk of causing secondary lymphedema at some point in a patient's life in absence of any precautions. Are you aware of any published studies that support your contentions that such precautions against the possibility of developing secondary lymphedema are unecessary following SNB procedures? If so, could you direct me to or forward a copy of any such studies that support this? Thank you in advance for taking any time to respond to this question. Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/22/2010 Sentinel node biopsy procedure is the standard of care now and has replaced the (old method of) axillary node dissection. if you survey breast centers nationally you will find that patients are not given restrictions if only sentinel node were performed, and the incidence of lymphedema has dramatically gone down in the last decade in correlation to this procedure being the new standard of care. Hopkins has performed more than 3800 sentinel node biopsy procedures and has had 1 patient develop lymphedema. As this is your specialty then you know that despite research little remains truly understood about this disorder, what truly are the triggers for it (ie, one patient can have 100 needle sticks and have nothing go wrong and another can have one and develop problems post axillary node dissection). As a 2 time breast cancer survivor who has had full axillary dissections bilaterally, i'm well aware of the fear of developing lymphedema. I also want specialists to recognize the need for breast cancer survivors to balance quality of life needs with advice about restrictions to their activities of daily living. I directly participated in conducting a research study with our patients 2 years ago where we measured patients arms at various points before and after surgery and again further out post op. During the study I felt the need to stop and pause about what we were \"learning\". I requested that 3 different nurses who had been trained by certified lymphedema therapists on our staff measure the same patients for 2 weeks, at the same time, without knowing the measurements the other 2 had calculated. all three came up with different measurements. so this has made me question the accuracy of several studies now that are in published form. that said, it is great to know there are individuals like yourself out there for patients dealing with lymphedema. If you've been reading this site then you also have seen that i have referred people to the national lymphedema network as well for information. I personally was having my ankles used for blood draws for several years which was incredibly unpleasant and had to stop when I developed phlebitis. so now I rotate my arm use. by no means ideal or preferred but again, we have to make decisions based on what we know and what we are able to do and balance that with quality of life. sometimes tough trades.

But if you had a radical mastectomy many years ago, you may have had arm swelling, or you may still be at risk for the condition. Prevention is very much in your best interest. Even the safest and most effective therapy may only delay the condition or keep it from worsening. Immediate care is essential with any trauma or infection.  www.breastcancer.org/tips/lymp... That whole section seems to be cut and pasted together: they say they got the material from the Living Beyond Breast Cancer info (which Dr. Weiss also sponsors) and they did put out a new handout about a year ago. Here's another disjointed paragraph under treatment: Sleeves and bandages each have pros and cons. The sleeves are easier to apply, and you can use them comfortably during your daily activities.

I actually heard a lecture from a PT at McGill about aquatic therapy for LE, and she was very specific about how to work in the water to treat LE, what she found was that doing the specific exercises weekly, women benefitted in the short term, but no long term benefit was seen (women lost up to  200cc of volume each session, but only did it once a week). Based on her explanations of how water pressure impacts our bodies, she wanted women to move in very specific ways to work \"proximal to distal\" Aqualymphatic exercise as an alternative therapy for lymphedema management following breast cancer: a randomized controlled pilot study Marie-Ève Letellier, Anna Towers and Robin Cohen Funded by a Canadian Cancer Society Feasibility Grant, 2005-2008 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19495810  So, my quick read through of the LE information on this site is that the overview is okay, but the the remainder seems like multiple authors were involved, and needs updating and clarification.

Mei Fu PhD says if 7 or more nodes are removed in a SNB, then she considers it equivalent to a ALND. I read a lot of path reports at work, and all these surgeons write, two nodes submitted, and then in the pathology report there are 7 nodes because what they saw at surgery and what was in the axillary tissue didn't agree. I do see a couple of surgeons who are always meticulous with the counter and the blue dye and when they say three nodes, that's what it is. There was a recent article that we all got upset about looking at the risk of LE after SNB, and they took 2 measurements on the arm, at two times---before surgery and one time after surgery and if they were 2 cm different, defined it as LE (many of the women on these boards don't have LE by that criteria--including me) and they came up with 1) 5% of women with SNB by that very insensitve method had LE and 2) The number of nodes removed did not correlate to the risk of LE. Otter has interpreted the study, and I've sent her interpretation along to Jane Armer PhD who very carefully follows over 250 women with multiple measurements, and she agreed that the flaw was in their method of defining LE. So, even a very insensitive study, still found a 5% incidence of LE after SNB. Makes Lillie's claims even that much more inaccurate. Kira My surgeon took 2 sentinel nodes, and 1 that was \"there\", but she left me with a whopping seroma. The study did say the disruption of the axilla was important in LE after SNB. ",

Lunakin, I had a very similar situation to you--seroma, axillary web and development of hand LE after insect bites--occured prior to rads, which didn't help the situation. Current research on LE is looking at inherent risk:  genetic, inflammatory and inherent lymphatic pump disorders. That said, some of us may be predisposed, but I'll always wonder if my seroma had been aspirated in a timely manner, if I had been informed about LE risk reduction (avoid heat, insect bites) if I could have dodged this bullet, and not be living with a chronic condition. Those who think that sentinel node biopsy involves just the initial node, are incorrect--the procedure is to identify the draining nodes and usually at least 2 light up, and I've definitely seen mets in the second node. SNB does have a false negative rate of about 5%. I've also seen initial negative SNB, and the final path shows disease. The NCCN guidelines are wriiten every year and reflect the latest concensus beliefs of the national experts. I went to school--Pitt-- where Bernie Fischer pioneered the lumpectomy and while I've read the articles from the National Bowel and Breast Study, I've never seen anything from Fischer ) about the lack of benefit from node sampling for staging . If it's out there, I'd appreciate the reference. Wasn't sure if Fischer was still alive, and found an article from Pitt that the former head oncologist from Johns Hopkins, Nancy Davidson, gave the lecture last year on his 90th birthday. Ironic, because we were going to appeal to her to deal with Lillie, and the level of misinformation on the ask an expert site. www.upmc.com/MediaRelations/Ne... I did read an editiorial in an oncology journal where they hoped that axillary sampling would some day be unecessary, but it's the current standard--to stage, and then to determine therapy--chemo and radiation. The latest study from ASCO--and they tend to present abstracts, not the full studies--implied that full ALND after positive SNB did not translate to a survival benefit--but I haven't read the study, and don't know if they then recommended radiation to the nodes and/or chemo. From what Lunakiin posted, the study was under-powered, too few patients. Who knows what other method issues are in the full study, until it's available for Otter's expert review. One thing that has come from the National Surgical Adjuvent Bowel and Breast Project is the oncotype dx, and my oncologist puts great stock in the predictive value of the test in determining therapy. I'd love to move this to the LE after SNB thread, and lymphtherapist--many people don't take nodes in DCIS. But, sometimes the final path shows invasive disease, and then a node sampling is recommended. SNB is almost never one node, the average is 3 nodes, and the surgeons around here tend to average closer to 6. I am not an oncologist--I work in radiation oncology, but am board certified in primary care, but, my oncologist at Dana Farber loves the practice model that I'm in and the collaborative nature of my work and I have learned a lot about oncology by caring for oncology patients. And Otter is so right: I am still very, very ticked off about developing LE after SNB, especially after my surgeon asked me how to manage my seroma, and I made the wrong choice--to leave it alone--and then told me she had no responsibility to help me manage my LE.  She told me LE is chronic, and not her problem. My surgeon was all about cosmesis--wanted to do a mastectomy for cosmesis (\"You didn't give me much to work with here.\"), rather than a lumpectomy (and I invoked Bernie Fischer to argue against that), and when I developed extensive post op bruising, she said \"it wasn't a simple lumpectomy, I worked on you for three hours and pulled all the breast tissue out of your axillary area to make a better cosmetic result.\" Well, it does look good. Too bad I have a swollen hand, and my wedding ring hasn't been on since my surgery. Let me bump up the SNB thread, and we'll keep this one for issues with Lillie. Kira",

Can you tell that I still get upset about the lack of physician \"ownership\" of LE? I wrote an essay about it in a writing class, and the professor said \"And you seem so mild mannered....\"  I teach physical diagnosis at a medical school and there is not a single mention of LE. There is one short paragraph in the text, but it's not required reading. My treatment team were good at what they did--and came highly recommended: my surgeon was meticulous, my rad onc was good at treatment planning, my onc has had bilat mx and reconstruction for DCIS and is an empathetic woman--yet none was willing to stand by my side and shepherd me through LE treatment.(Binney and the women on this board did that.) My primary is wonderful and she told me that she just doesn't know enough to help. It's not fair: that we got it, that there's no standards for treatment--the clinic my surgeon sent me to in her hospital was in the complimentary medicine center, along with Reiki--and staffed by all massage therapists, but headed by a nutritionist who knew absolutely nothing about LE. Yet were able to charge $360/hour. It was when the massage therapist told me it wasn't LE but carpal tunnel syndrome, and I asked if he even knew where the median nerve ran, as I paid my $72 dollar copay, that I filed a complaint about the clinic with Blue Cross.  And the medical director of Blue Cross, whose wife had breast surgery, thanked me for educating him on the subject when we spoke. I went to enroll in a Tamoxifen trial at Dana Farber, and the fellow actually checked me for LE. She was the first physician to do that. Getting mad probably isn't really helpful here, but I still do get mad--my surgeon ignored a axillary seroma that I had to show to her (actually she asked ME what to do about it, and I made the wrong choice), and if I knew then what I know now (big risk for LE)--I would have had her aspirate it. So, I try to follow Binney's example, and see the positive, and use my hard learned lessons to help others. But I still get angry....and frustrated.... Kira ",

It's treated by therapists, so it's both under the radar and there's no physician involvement, or knowledge of the treatment--except for a handful of doctors in the US. It's an orphan disease--not technically--because it's so common, but in terms of physician ownership of the problem.

Action Points This study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. Breast cancer patients with a positive but nonpalpable sentinel lymph node have a reduced risk of lymphedema with radiation compared with surgery. Point out that recurrence rates came out similar, at 0.5% with completion axillary lymph node dissection and 1.0% with axillary radiotherapy over 5 years. CHICAGO -- Breast cancer patients with a positive but nonpalpable sentinel lymph node may be better off with radiation than with further axillary surgery, the AMAROS trial affirmed. Recurrence rates came out similar, at 0.5% with completion axillary lymph node dissection and 1.0% with axillary radiotherapy over 5 years, Emiel Rutgers, MD, of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, and colleagues found. Overall survival didn't differ between the groups either, they reported here at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. But surgery doubled the lymphedema risk compared with radiation alone, at 40% versus 22% at year 1 and 28% versus 14% at year 5 (both P<0.0001). These findings were seen as largely confirmatory of those reported at the meeting 2 years ago from the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, which showed no advantage in survival or relapse prevention from routine axillary node dissection after discovering a positive sentinel node. It also confirms the importance of radiation for these patients, commented Elizabeth Mittendorf, MD, PhD, of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, in an interview with MedPage Today. \"Those of us who have adopted Z0011, which in the U.S., we mostly have, have contended that a very important part of Z0011 was the fact that every patient was undergoing breast conservation so every patient was getting radiation,\" she said. \"You do need some treatment but it doesn't have to be surgery, the radiation is adequate by itself without doing further surgery.\" The lower lymphedema risk of radiation in AMAROS was somewhat a surprise though, she suggested. \"If you had asked me before, I would have told you surgery and radiation are probably comparable with respect to the complication of lymphedema and this clearly shows that's not true,\" Mittendorf said. The randomized AMAROS trial included 1,425 women with early-stage, invasive breast tumors up to 5 cm in size that were clinically node-negative but yielded a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. They were enrolled in the trial from 2001 to 2010. Disease-free survival rates were 87% with completion axillary node dissection and 83% with axillary dissection, which wasn't statistically significant at P=0.1788. Overall survival was 93% at 5 years in both treatment groups. The surgery group also tended to have more shoulder movement impairment early in the trial and to report poorer quality of life with regard to movement but better quality of life related to swelling, but none of these differences were statistically significant. The researchers cautioned that the planned non-inferiority test was underpowered because of an unexpectedly low number of recurrences and deaths. Also, the trial enrolled a select group of women with relatively small tumors and no evidence of nodal metastases at presentation, so the results wouldn't generalize to those who come in with more advanced disease or have known large nodal metastases, Mittendorf added. Another limitation was the lack of a definition for lymphedema, which can occur across the spectrum from arm swelling resulting only in a feeling of heaviness to cases requiring compression garments and lifestyle changes, she noted. The study was supported by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Charitable Trust. The researchers reported no conflicts of interest. Mittendorf reported no conflicts of interest.

Short rant about LE and hospitals: I had a D&C yesterday (my 3rd in 5 years on tamoxifen....) and when the first nurse told me that I couldn't wrap my hand in gauze and wear my pink g-sleeve that says \"No IV/no blood pressure\" because the operating room is sterile, I just put it on. She said--but we have a pink bracelet on you. Yeah, that no one looks at. And, when I got home, there were bruises on my good arm from the blood pressure cuff. And when the anesthesia nurse tried to bully me, I just held my ground--actually they all said the anesthesiologist would not let me wear the sleeve/wrap or just have IV sedation, and she came in, looked at my arm and said \"You've sure had a hard time, haven't you?\" And upheld my anesthesia preferences. I always like to do battle when half naked, starved and dehydrated, and thoroughly pissed off at doing this yet again. But, Binney sent me the g-sleeve (sounds risque, but sure isn't) and the women here have told their tales of needing to advocate against hospital personnel. The nurse anesthetist who was arguing with me that she reserved the right to give me general against my will also told me that LE was rare now. Like she knew anything. I said, well, when you get it, it's not rare for me, is it? And the parting shot: with my adhesive allergy on my wrist band that no one read, was to have my IV taken out, and a band aid put on my hand. I asked my husband to give me paper tape and I removed it. LE, the gift that sure keeps giving.",

I don't think palm swelling is that unusual, or they wouldn't sell palm spots from Solaris--most gloves do not provide good compression for the palm, they are tight over the top of the hand, and kind of lift on the palm and people do swell there. The palm drainage is interesting: the top third drains to the front of the hand, and the bottom drains to the forearm. The middle finger drains to the forearm--at least in the Foeldi Clinic book I have. Consider a palm spot--either make one out of foam or look into Solaris palm spots. Sometimes they will drive fluid up to the hand, but you have that under great control. http://shopsolarismed.com/magento/lymphedema/edemapads/palmer-swell-spot.html You can buy them direct from Solaris (I use the small ones) or bandagesplus or lymphedema products. The Raynaud's is tricky, because you have very sensitive blood vessels, and compression makes the tips of my fingers purple, and with you--cold will do that. The medicine for Raynaud's, calcium channel blockers, are bad for lymphedema--Stanley Rockson (Stanford) informed me that they interfere with nitrous oxide and the lymphatic vessels and are contraindicated in lymphedema. But people with significant Raynaud's need them. Hope this helps. Kira ",

It is not painful and the patient usually feels an immediate increase in mobility. In a personal communication with Dr Moe, I wondered if breaking the cords was a safe practice. he questioned if we were actually breaking the cord or rather the supporting fibrous structures around them.

So, intentional popping is controversial amongst the PT's who are expert in AWS: if some popping occurs in the course of careful treatment, it's likely not going to cause harm and will release some of the tethering.

The therapist could take baseline measurements, assess you and teach you some LE risk reduction behaviors and possibly some exercises and manual lymph drainage. Depending on your needs, it would be a single visit, or a series of visits. As far as compression: you should have both a sleeve and hand protection--usually a gauntlet if you've had no finger swelling. The purpose is for flying and if you have any symptoms--heaviness, achiness, swelling of the arm, and possibly for exercise. There is controversy about wearing compression garments if you don't have LE---it's most clearly indicated for flying. Poorly fitting compression can trap fluid so it can cause trouble if not fitted well. Any physician can order it, but you'd have to go to a DME company/fitter to get them. I'd think a LE therapist evaluation would be a good idea, as chemo, rads, ALND all put you at risk, and knowledge is important. Hope that helps. Kira",

Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled.

Binney wrote to the head of LymphaDivas because in their newsletter they showed women lifiting hundreds of pounds with just a sleeve, and it took some back and forth, but finally the president, Dr. Howard Levin, consulted Andrea Cheville, a great physician at Mayo and she wrote a wonderful page on why you should always protect the hand--except in rare circumstances. Here's the article:  USE OF GAUNTLETS AND COMPRESSION SLEEVES IN LYMPHEDEMA MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION Dr. Andrea Cheville, Associate Professor of Physical Medicine at the Mayo Clinic Controversy persists regarding the benefits of compression garments in preventing lymphedema. A key stumbling block is the possibility of triggering hand lymphedema when wearing a sleeve without a glove or gauntlet. Compression applied to the arm may reduce lymph flow from the hand. Even a normal lymphatic system works harder to drain lymph from the hand than other parts of the arm. This fact explains why hand lymphedema is often the most challenging to treat and why lymphedema specialists take great pains to prevent it. Concern that compression sleeves may inadvertently trigger hand lymphedema underlies the recommendation to always wear a compression gauntlet or glove with a sleeve. Most women at risk for lymphedema who have not noted increased arm volume, symptoms, or other indicators of early lymphedema wear their sleeves during activities that increase lymph production. Examples include airplane travel, vigorous aerobic or resistive exercise, and repetitive activities performed in an intense fashion. It is important that women using preventative compression sleeves combine their sleeve with either a gauntlet or glove during such activities. Particular attention should be paid to constriction at the shoulder band, elbow, and wrist crease. Sometimes overlap of a gauntlet and sleeve at the wrist can cause excessive pressure. For women with established lymphedema the decision to use a gauntlet or glove is based on slightly different considerations. Lymphedema of the upper limb may be distributed in a surprisingly patchy manner. For example, lymphedema may be restricted to the underside of the upper arm or the back of the hand. It goes unsaid that lymphedema is a very individual phenomenon. Many women with lymphedema never note hand involvement despite use of an arm compression sleeve for many years. However, even these women should remain watchful for hand swelling since lymphedema is a dynamic process with the potential to change over time. A quick check for hand edema after engaging in the activities listed above is always warranted. Differences in skin texture or the visibility of bones, veins and tendons may indicate lymphedema. These changes suggest a need to consider some form of hand compression. Of particular concern are women with lymphedema that plan to begin an exercise program or to significantly increase their activity and do not use hand compression. For these individuals use of hand compression during exertion is crucial until a stable level has been established. At that point a woman may carefully experiment with using a sleeve alone. However, it is always prudent and appropriate to use hand compression during vigorous arm activity. As previously noted, hand lymphedema is more difficult to control than arm lymphedema. The hand's irregular shape, its critical role in daily activities and the difficulty inherent in precisely fitting a gauntlet/glove all contribute to this problem. It is vital that early signs of hand lymphedema be taken seriously and that appropriate modifications are made to a patient's lymphedema maintenance program. In summary, a gauntlet or glove should be used in conjunction with compression sleeves when used for lymphedema prevention. Women with established lymphedema who have not required hand compression should consider adding a glove or gauntlet in situations that may increase lymph production in their arms. Many patients with lymphedema spend their entire lives well-controlled with use of a sleeve alone. A good comparison to the decision to wear a gauntlet/glove with a sleeve is that it is like buying insurance. The risk of having hand lymphedema is present in all women with arm lymphedema and those at risk. Adding a gauntlet buys some protection against this event and like all insured risk, we do not know who will be helped by the insurance and who might not even need it. Working with physicians and therapists skilled in lymphedema management will ensure that each woman develops a safe and effective compression plan tailored to her unique needs.

The program was developed at the breast care center of Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, Md. It begins with a preoperative patient interview and structured evaluation by a physical therapist. The assessment includes what physical therapists call an upper-quarter screen, which evaluates shoulder range of motion, strength, and arm volume. Self-reported pain, fatigue, function, and activity level are recorded. At that time, the patient is also instructed in a home exercise program she is to start 2 weeks post surgery. These are simple range-of-motion exercises focused on forward flexion overhead; abduction; internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint; and scapular retraction, Nicole L. Stout explained at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. The patient is subsequently seen by the physical therapist (in conjunction with her regular follow-up visits with an oncologist or surgeon) at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 60 months post surgery. If upper-extremity dysfunction worsens, more intensive interventions are introduced. The rationale for this prospective surveillance program lies in an understanding that the shoulder and arm impairments caused by breast cancer surgery and radiation therapy are typically subtle initially, but if left unidentified and uncorrected, they often progress to serious rotator cuff damage, \"frozen\" shoulder, and debilitating lymphedema, according to Ms. Stout, a civilian research physical therapist at the military center. She had previously presented her 1-year prospective outcomes. This time around, she presented prospective 5-year follow-up data on 86 breast cancer patients who participated in the program. This is the first prospective cohort study in the United States to track breast cancer-related upper-extremity morbidity and functional outcomes for this long a time period. The 12-month and 5-year visits included formal assessment of upper-extremity outcomes using the Harvard Alumni Activity Survey, the Upper Limb Disability Questionnaire, and the Short Form-36. At 5 years, 11% of the women had stage I/II lymphedema and 38% had subclinical lymphedema (defined as less than 3% arm volume swelling as measured by a Perometer). These results compare favorably with those of published studies on lymphedema, which have reported long-term rates of stage I-III arm swelling in the 40%-60% range, she noted. In all, 18% of patients reported arm numbness at 5 years, 17% noted shoulder pain, 3% had neck pain, and 1% had chest wall pain. One-third of subjects reported fatigue of level 3 or more on a 10-point visual analog scale. Again, other investigators have documented long-term rates of clinically significant fatigue in the 50%-60% range. At 5 years post surgery, patients demonstrated less impairment of physical activity than at preoperative baseline. At baseline, 33% had significant limitations in terms of carrying heavy objects, performing household chores, and other physical activities. After 5 years of prospective surveillance and tailored physical therapy, only 20% of patients had physical activity limitations. However, 68% of patients reported experiencing some restrictions on their social activity at 5 years, and 52% experienced limitations on their recreational activities. The study was funded by the medical center. Ms. Stout declared having no financial conflicts of interest.

A well fitted night garment functions like a wrap--usually not quite as well for hands, but pretty well for arms, and reduces the volume. Personally, wrapping works far better for me--and clearly it works for you as well. The daytime compression garment--and Jobst only has THREE sizes--and relatively low compression, so how could she give you the wrong size in a Jobst?, which is the farthest sleeve from custom, but the easiest to dispense as it has a huge range of size--is to maintain the volume decrease. Your arm does decrease--and that is your new normal, but it has re-filled, so a wise therapist would figure out when that is happening, and have you wrap/use foam filed --ie. \"night\" garments--to reduce that swelling and keep it reduced with compression garments that actually compress you effectively. Time for a new therapist. Some people do need compression pumps. I asked my LE therapist why things got worse as the day went on--and she said because the lymph fluid was collecting.  We've all had experiences with less than ideal therapists--I had a LANA certified one tell me not to wrap my pinkie--and woke up with a swollen pinkie, Binney had a LANA certified therapist significantly worsen her LE. We've found other people who are wonderful, ultimately.  Please Hope, find someone new. You don't give up on a patient and tell them to be glad they're alive, but you didn't figure out how to manage the lymphedema that was your job to manage: she failed and you deserve better. Far better. Hopefully one of the other therapists will be better. It sounds like a key to getting your LE under control is that you learn how to wrap, and use that skill when needed. Kira",

Also, when you're in the midst of a full blown allergy attack, all the inflammatory mediators are on high gear--that's why prescription medications are nasal steroids, leukotriene inhibitors--singulair. So, between the pain and the inflammation, I think you're just literally inflammed. Do watch for cellulitis. Benadryl does inhibit tamoxifen metabolism, if that's an issue for you. It's powerful stuff as an anti-histamine. The sudafed is a vasoconstrictor--because benadryl doesn't do much for the rhinitis of allergies--I can't think how it would add to LE.  I wish I had better answers: I think pain, full blown allergies and general inflammation are setting you up to swell, and you're taking the right stuff.

From the patients I see at work, most struggle the most early on. \\But, when you swell, despite doing all you can and depriving yourself of things you enjoy, it's horrible . Binney talks about how family and friends desperately want you to be back to normal. My husband is the king of denial, and I heard this story a long time ago, and bring it up to him as needed: True story--A woman has an emergency C-section, and on her first day home from the hospital, develops Bell's Palsy and calls to her husband that something is terribly wrong. He comes into the room, stares at her face for a long time and says \"You know, I'm not sure you ever could blink that eye.\" So, when my husband requires a reality check, I just repeat that line. There was a study that showed that people who were prayed for--even if they didn't know it, got better, and then they looked at the data again, and it made no difference. I'm so glad people get comfort from their faith, but like you, it's not a personal part of my life. When people pray for me, I thank them. Do you remember Bernie Siegal, of Love, Medicine and Miracles? I knew a woman whose lovely young husband was in his book: he thought positive thoughts and his throat cancer was cured, but then it came back and they had to remove his voice box, and he felt so guilty, he felt he hadn't been positive enough and they should remove him from the book. I do believe it will get better, but it sure is frustrating and disheartening, and when (as my daughter says) your reality is not validated--it's infuriating. Kira",

He dismissed acupuncture out of hand, because it was developed so long ago, and on flawed premise, per him. I think that complementary medicine has benefits, and that there are hucksters out there, like Dr. Oz and Andrew Weil who don't look at the science and try to sell things, and that the studies of CAM tend to be flawed, unfortunately. I took gigong and did Tai Chi in the first year after my surgery, and found it very helpful. I've found acupunture to be operator dependent. I think we need to protect ourselves against harm with complementary medicine, but also look at why it's so popular and why it feels so great to go into a quiet room where someone touches you gently and with the intent to heal. So, I did toss out some vitamins after reading the Offit book, and talked to my LE therapist today---who is a firm believer in acupuncture and supplements--and she just would use the meridians and not put the needles in the quadrant. I once heard a lecture by Andrea Cheville MD of Mayo Clinic, who is trained in acupuncture, and she tried it on her patients, and wasn't impressed with the results. She never did a formal study that I know of. My parents belong to Kaiser Permanente in California, and acupuncture is offered at the medical center for back pain. I totally agree with you that we should keep an open mind, avoid the polarity that is developing and there's lousy science in a lot of studies, not just CAM. Thanks for such a thoughtful post.",

It can be a pull on your arm, and I do remember that once my daughter got a huge blister because she didn't wear gloves while lunging him. So, I think horses are good for the body and soul, and those of us with LE, need to figure out what things we do with them that are good for our LE--it sounds like riding is good, and we each need to figure out how much lunging, grooming, mucking and even how much pressure on the reins we can tolerate. We were considering boarding our horse at a therapeutic center, and we spent some time there, and it was a great place. I also know that with the economy, people are abandoning horses and there are rescues. And as Chele said, no one can groom their horse enough.

You and your doctors will need to decide the best course of action to get local control of this beast disease: but three nodes with extracapsular extension wouldn't fit that study. So, the question seems to be, surgery vs. radiation--and my question is, will they want to do radiation even if they do surgery? I've seen that be recommended (I used to work for a radiation oncologist, and saw all versions of treatment plans.) There is one very good study that followed women with ALND for >20 years and most who developed lymphedema, got it in the first 5 years, but then about 1-2% a year followed, so at 20 years, about half the women had lymphedema (LE)--but that would mean half DIDN'T get it--so always remember the odds are in your favor. At the breast cancer cancer where I was treated, they now have a high risk protocol, where women with ALND are sent to the LE therapists immediately, for baseline measurements, to learn manual lymphatic drainage, lymphedema risk reduction behaviors and, if appropriate, to get a compression sleeve/gauntlet to wear if they're very active or having symptoms (like aching, subtle swelling, heaviness, tightness) Ways to avoid LE:  post op--don't raise that arm for 10-14 days, to allow the lymphatic collectors to heal. I know the nodes will be gone, but not ever single one of them, and lymphatic collectors have a narrow window to heal--so don't raise that arm over shoulder height for 10-14 days. No hanging from door frames. Request a referral to a qualified lymphedema therapist to learn manual lymphatic drainage--how to gently massage the skin, where the superficial lymphatics are, to move it along www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... Lymphedema risk reduction behaviors--and sometimes you have to fight, like with blood draws and blood pressures, as there is a move to call them \"myths\" www.stepup-speakout.org/riskre... Here is the one from the National Lymphedema Network--we have an on-going fight with them, as they decided to not support compression garments on air flight, based on lousy studies, but women at risk need to know that air flight is a risk to trigger LE, and make a personal decision, and a low compression sleeve can be helpful www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... You will never be able to get accurate statistics on your risk of LE, as there is no single diagnostic criteria, and somewhere Carol posted the ranges that are cited. I'd say, somewhere like 40-50%, but some of us get it with three nodes out and plenty of women with ALND and radiation never get it--lymphatic systems vary from woman to woman and some women are blessed with robust lymphatic systems and others of us, just don't have it. I think the key, as you face these really hard decisions, is to treat the breast cancer the best possible way, be aware of LE and LE risks and prevention, but realize the biggest risk is the nasty ILC, and you want that treated. Sorry again for the delay. Please let me know if you need more information, and sending hugs and hopes for healing as you face this. Kira",

This is from the stepupspeakout site: Some people (usually small-boned, petite women) find that even low compression levels cause their fingers to turn icy and blue, or their arms to tingle and become painfully sensitive to touch. When they remove the offending garment their arm or hand may swell dramatically. In an attempt to control this rebound swelling, they and their therapist may decide to try a sturdier garment with a higher compression level, only to find that the problem worsens. In some cases, a lower compression level and a very soft fabric can solve this kind of compression sensitivity. Fabrics such as those used for neonates or the very old are good choices. They don't hold up well and may have to be replaced more often, but the therapeutic results may be worth the extra care. www.stepup-speakout.org/proper...  Binney is the expert on this subject.

Usually lymph drainage is done in a specific sequence: you clear the lymph nodes in the neck, in the arm pit, move the lymph across your chest from the \"bad to good\" side, and then work the arm from the nearest point to the farthest--\"proximal to distal\"---near to far--that way the area is clear to receive the lymph fluid.

I don't know if you have the Lebed DVD, but her exercises are safe for LE, and involve stretching, they're broken into segments--you do the lymphatic one first, and then I do the ones I feel I need (like arms/torso) I finished radiation just under 2 years ago, and if I don't stretch--overhead, the twist on the bed, another one where I touch my hand to my back between the shoulder blades and put some pressure back on the elbow--I get tight.

I'm going to try and put in some images. So, in the classic sequence for MLD, the arm/hand is the last thing you do. First you clear the abdomen. You can press down in the five hand positions, or do resisted deep breathing--try and take a deep breath, as you press down. If you massage, gently but as deeply as you can tolerate, with the pressure toward the belly button, massage over the areas around 5 times each. One of the women on this board, would roll a tennis ball on her abdomen to clear the abdominals. Then, clear the neck and the \"good\" arm pit, and then the quadrant of the good side, and open the groin nodes of the affected side to receive the fluid. And, if someone else is working on you, they'll clear your back as well. You can kind of use a foam roller to mimick that. Only then do you work on the arm/breast, and you work near to far (proximal to distal). The analogy is to get the first cars in a traffic jam moving. Hope these images help. Yeah, I was too thin and only had a SNB, but I kind of knew I had a tendency to swell, so LE was the first thing I asked my surgeon and was told not to worry...  ",

The stance of the APTA (American Physical Therapy Assoc.) is that ANY PT can treat lymphedema, and so many \"weekend wonder\" courses are offered. Binney once tried to complain to LANA when she felt the care of a LANA certified therapist was poor, and got the response that they just give the test, and she should complain to the licensure board. And with so many health care providers have knowledge deficits about lymphedema treatment, these therapists operate without supervision.  It sounds like she's a massage therapist who was trained in lymphedema. But what training. I'm actually taking a training course, which is incredibly intense--from Klose--but I could easily see how someone could take it, and it's done in 10 days, and go out and make mistakes. Ironically, I was treated by a Klose trained, LANA certified PT who was horrid. I just found out she took the Klose course in 2008--not all that long before she saw me and gave me lousy treatment and advice. This lack of quality control, makes a difficult situation so much harder. So, in response to her answers: Q: When I wear my Tubigrip sleeve at night, my hand is swollen in the morning. What should I do? A: 1. Don't wear the sleeve at night, or 2. Wear the sleeve but buy a weight lifting glove to wear with it. (She specifically told me previously that I should always wear my sleeve at night.): If you swell at night, you should be bandaged. The wearing of a sleeve without hand protection can cause hand lymphedema. Q: Can't I get a compression sleeve with a glove? A: If you want to get a compression sleeve, order one online. Get one with 30-40 compression, class 2, and either Juzo or Jobst brands. As far as gloves, gloves are very expensive and can cost up to $1,000.Never get a sleeve without an official fitter measuring you, and they are covered by insurance. And, why is she putting you in a class 2 sleeve, with no hand protection, when you have hand swelling. An off the shelf glove, on line, costs around $150--for a Juzo or a Medi 95, but you need professional measuring, and many women need custom gloves. My custom gloves cost $400 a pair, insurance reimburses in the mid $200 range and I pay 20%. I have a great fitter and the first try required 5 gloves until we got it right--Juzo. Q: So I can just go online and order a sleeve? Don't you need to measure me? And isn't there an Isotoner support glove I could get (which I saw for $16 on Amazon)?You can just order a sleeve online, and Jobst comes as small/medium/large, while Juzo and Medi offer multiple sizes. Many women need custom sleeves, and poor fitting compression can trap flud and cause harm. A: Sure, if you want me to measure you, I can. (She then gave me guidelines on measuring myself.) And oh yes, you can get an Isotoner but make sure it fits properly.Joe Zuther put on his blog how to measure yourself, but ideally, it should be done by an experienced fitter: http://www.lymphedemablog.com/2011/08/23/measuring-for-compression-arm-sleeves/ She still never talked about wrapping, and didn't in any way encourage me to come back in to continue sessions with her....which I'm not! I'm looking for a different therapist. Meanwhile, I haven't been wearing my Tubigrip at all because it makes my hand swollen and doesn't seem to help with bringing down the swelling anyway. I'm feeling very frustrated because she hasn't been helpful at all and seems so lackadaisical. I guess I was just supposed to be satisfied for the rest of my life with the three Tubigrip sleeves she gave me. She did not get you in perfect control and ready to transition to maintenance phase. She should be reported to whatever board licenses her, as she's potentially harmful. Lymphedema is a chronic disease, and ideally, there should be 6 month check ups for patients in good control, sooner as needed. ARGHHHHHH Kira",

Makes perfect sense that any swelling will physically compress a nerve that is already damaged from chemo. I get those symptoms if I talk on the phone with my elbow bent. Add neuropathy to the mix and all bets are off. My daughter coined a phrase when she had migraine that presented as vertigo and was told she needed a psych consult (at 16): \"Denying my reality\" and we've used it a lot on this site. Recently, the same daughter had a question about her optic nerve, and we're at the same hospital: Mass Eye and Ear where their head of otology confirmed the MAV (migraine associated vertigo) and the f##$king neuro-opthalmologist fellow starts to give us grief about how migraine can't present as vertigo, and I said \"The head of your otology department at THIS institution diagnosed her: Look it up!!\" She was busy trying not to puke as they dilated her eyes, and it turned out to be a false alarm. There was documentation, and yet, once again, some uninformed moron wanted to deny her reality.",

I'll check in frequently to see how it's going. I called the therapist at the local hospital, and she had gone to a 2 day course, and didn't know what a fitter WAS(???)   So, I'm in my third decade working in medicine, knew enough to ask my surgeon about LE (\"7% chance, it won't happen\".... It happened three weeks post op...) and without this board, and specifically Binney, I wouldn't have had a clue how to find treatment. Unfortunately, the PT clinics at the local city hospitals do LE along with everything else, and had a scarcity of well trained therapists.   And, now, taking care of women with LE due to bc, I realized that it takes a lot of knowledge to get them good and convenient and affordable care.   No excuses. I knew nothing, and learned the hard way, and am still learning.   At the follow up at my rad onc's the medical assistant gave me a fight about not using my LE arm for blood pressure....You'd think that office would have a clue.    Thank you Linda.   My LE therapist takes the booklets from Jobst to every doctor's appointment--she gave them to the breast surgeon she saw (family history) and the woman was huffy about it..... Kira  MOTC: I work with a man whose wife had bc, and he gets it. I called the medical director of our state's Blue Cross to complain about the care at the LE clinic where my surgeon sent me: soley staffed by massage therapists, I was told it was carpal tunnel syndrome, not LE. He said I taught him more about LE in the half hour we spoke than he had learned in 30 years of practice. ",

I realized that my nodes were getting rads during treatment, called my rad onc in a panic, as I already had swelling and was told \"Radiation to the level I and II nodes NEVER causes LE.\" WRONG!!!!

It's called complete decongestive therapy, or CDT. Far too many therapists take short cuts and don't realize that lymphedema is a clinical diagnosis and there is no standard measurement that defines severity, and the greatest risk for severe lymphedema, is having mild lymphedema.

HGF and MET mutations in primary and secondary lymphedema. Finegold DN, Schacht V, Kimak MA, Lawrence EC, Foeldi E, Karlsson JM, Baty CJ, Ferrell RE. Source Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, 130 Desoto Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. david.finegold@hgen.pitt.edu Abstract BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is the abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the interstitial space. Primary lymphedema is a rare genetic condition with both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive modes of inheritance. Three genes, FLT4 (VEGFR3), FOXC2, and SOX18 cause varying forms of primary lymphedema. In industrialized countries, secondary lymphedema is usually associated with cancer therapy and/or trauma. Recent observations suggested that hepatocyte growth factor/high affinity hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF/MET) were new candidate lymphedema genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The coding exons and flanking regions of HGF and MET were directly sequenced in 145 lymphedema probands, 59 unrelated women with secondary lymphedema following treatment for breast cancer, 21 individual patients with lymphedema and intestinal lymphangiectasia, and at least 159 unrelated ethnic matched control individuals. Mutations leading to truncation or missense changes in evolutionarily conserved residues of HGF and MET were identified. These mutations were not polymorphic in control individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of HGF/MET mutations in primary lymphedema, lymphedema/lymphangiectasia, and breast cancer-associated secondary lymphedema suggests that the HGF/MET pathway is causal or alters susceptibility for a broad range of lymphedema phenotypes. The HGF/MET pathway provides a new target for the prevention and/or treatment of lymphedema. Rockson's editorIal: Taken together, these two manuscripts shed important light upon the genetic substrate of lymphedema, both pri- mary and secondary. In fact, it is likely that the distinction between primary and secondary lymphedema will progres- sively blur. Continued emphasis upon the genetic investi- gation of lymphedema is likely to provide additional insights into the mechanisms of lymphatic health and its perturba- tion through heritable and acquired disease. So, when is all this research going to translate into 1) identification of people at risk and 2) TREATMENT??? Kira",

The potential contribution of genetic susceptibility to risk of developing secondary lymphedema following surgical trauma, radiation, and other tissue insults has not been studied. Experimental Design:To determine if women with breast cancer and secondary lymphedema had mutations in candidate lymphedema genes, we undertook a case - control study of 188 women diagnosed with breast cancer recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Breast Cancer Program (www.upmccancercenter.com/breas... between 2000-2010. Candidate lymphedema genes, GJC2 (encoding connexin 47 [Cx47]), FOXC2, HGF, MET, and FLT4 (encoding VEGFR3), were sequenced for mutation. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro functional assays were used to confirm significance of novel mutations. Results:Cx47 mutations were identified in individuals having secondary lymphedema following breast cancer treatment but not in breast cancer controls or normal women without breast cancer. These novel mutations are dysfunctional as assessed through in vitro assays and bioinformatics analysis, and provide evidence that altered gap junction function leads to lymphedema. Conclusions:Our findings challenge the view that secondary lymphedema is solely due to mechanical trauma and support the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility is an important risk factor for secondary lymphedema. A priori recognition of genetic risk 1) raises the potential for early detection and intervention for a high risk group, and 2) allows the possibility of altering surgical approach and/or chemo- and radiation therapy, or direct medical treatment of secondary lymphedema with novel connexin modifying drugs.

Also, the webs are thrombosed lymphatics, with some veins--whoever was told they are \"just\" tendons, was mistaken. I have articles of the pathology. Axillary web is VERY common, some studies will say over 50%, but severe and early axillary web is a strong predictor of progression to LE, despite early PT, as shown in a study in the  BMJ: Remember all these women were involved in PT with trained LE therapists, and the women with early axillary web went on to develop LE despite excellent care They wrote: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20068255 (It's a free full length article also)",

Could I have dodged this bullet. Likely not. But, after 2 years of LE, it is becoming a part of my life, not front and central and limiting everything I do. I went to this lecture at the Vodder school, and they looked at compliance, with 100% was this impossible standard: nighttime wrapping, daytime garments, MLD and exercises twice a day--and no one was 100% compliant. But if you were 75 % compliant, it was good enough, and everyone will vary in what they can get away with. LE stinks for so many reasons: it's shameful, it's not acknowledged, it's under-treated, it's under-recognized, it's a daily reminder of cancer that we want move past, it requires management that feels huge--even if the time is not as huge as it feels, and so much more. I work in rad onc, and I saw a woman with a lymphedema yesterday, and we had a discussion about is it just a swollen arm or should she get treatment--she's older and her daughter is her ride, and the daughter didn't want to take her to therapy, and the mother insisted. But they had quite a fight that I had to break up. No one else taking care of her noticed that the one arm is 7 cm bigger. So, so there's no hiding for me, unless I switch jobs. Revkat: my parents came to stay, and didn't say a word about cancer or LE, but my mother called my sister and told her how distressed she was to see me wrapped. I called her and asked that she talk to me directly and she started sobbing about how distressing it is. On the other hand, my younger daughter says: if it keeps you from swelling, and it just takes some time, why wouldn't you wrap? Families. So, I hope I'm moving on, despite hanging around these boards, but it will always be something I need to figure into my life. Tina: you made the best decisions you could with the information available. No recriminations, because you made good decisions. Suzy: hope that stubborn swelling gets the heck out of there. Laura: you do what you can do to manage this. Compliance is relative. I come to these boards because no one else I know has LE (except patients, and there are boundaries there), and no one else really understands, and it's lonely being the only one in a compression glove, and hiding from the sun/heat/bugs.

If your LE isn't cured, it's because unfortunately, there is no cure and you're doing the best you can. Behavioral change is extremely tough: doctors prescribe it, and then patients are left to struggle with it. I heard a great lecture from a psychiatrist recently about this: she said \"Think of something you've been meaning to change. Okay, now I won't let you out of this stuffy auditorium until you firmly commit to it.\" and the universal response was fear, resistance and embarrassment. You don't impose change (weight loss) on patients, you work with them. I'd suggest reframing it into the list of accomplishments since your last visit: you tried wrapping, you're working on diet, you're very compliant with your LE care--you're a super star patient.

I saw a great list, and now I can't remember where I saw it. I recently re-read the transcript of a podcast by Andrea Cheville on LE on the LBBC site, and she discussed it www.lbbc.org/Event-Archive/200... We placed the most emphasis on lymphedema in the arm because that's the most common site of lymphedema. It's the most challenging area for the body to drain lymph from, since it's quite far from the trunk and the lymph node beds. We're learning more and more that lymphedema ofthe breast is not at all uncommon. Lymphedema of the area under the armpit, the axilla, is a common The lymphatics in the armpit are compromised through surgery and radiation, which makes it challenging [...] for the lymphatic system to remove fluid and solid waste from the arm. We don't have a good explanation for why it takes a year, two years, three years. Most women will develop some suggestion. They'll have an episode of swelling within three years of their primary breast cancer treatment, so the vast majority of women who will ultimately develop lymphedema are aware ofthat within three years. Why there's such a delay, we really truly don't understand. The current explanatory model goes as follows. It sends in inflammatory cells, what we call neutrophils, but they're white blood cells that penetrate the tissue. They're trying to solve the problem, but, unfortunately, they cause more problem because they perpetuate the inflammation and the scarification, the scarring process, which can cause further compromise because this fibrosis, this scarring, can encompass the lymph vessels that are still in the arm, that are still working, and thereby worsen the lymphedema. We get into a vicious cycle of more debris accumulation, more inflammation, more scarring, more compromise of the lymphatic system. There's more in the transcript. The NLN recently released a supplement to their early screening guideline, but for some reason it's not on their site right now, and I think that's were I saw the early signs. I think the best thing is to see a LE therapist early on for measurements and guidance with exercise and risk reduction. Kira",

There is a technique that is called \"skin lifting\" where you lay on your back, with the arm supported by pillows and gently pull down on the skin over the axilla toward the opposite hip, gentle traction, and hold for about a minute. Also, you can extend the arm, hold onto the base of the cord and gently flex your wrist back. The key is gentle.

The lymphatic system has superficial collectors under the skin (what gets worked with lymphatic massage) and deep collectors that are larger vessels. And since veins run with lymph, sometimes there is a situation where a vein is clotted off as well. Way back I put in the pathology of Mondors and AWS and how they overlapped.

Lymph nodes are removed in the course of surgery and/or radiotherapy, resulting in damage to the lymphatic system. Special recommendations have been defined for cancer patients in aftercare, which are intended to help avoid or at least delay the development of arm lymphedema. 1. At home and at work - Avoid any injuries, overexertion, heat and cold - Be careful using kitchen knives - Be careful when sewing - always use a thimble - Do not wash dishes in hot water - Always use oven mittens when working at a hot stove or oven - Avoid carrying heavy shopping bags - Be careful when ironing - Avoid using the hand of your swollen arm to hold cigarettes - Avoid wearing a wrist watch on your swollen arm - Always wear arm sleeves or rubber gloves when working in the household 2. Clothing - Ensure that the straps of your bra do not cut into your shoulder or chest - Wear the lightest possible breast prosthesis 3. Beauty treatment and body care - Try to keep as clean as possible and care for your skin thoroughly - When doing your fingernails, avoid cutting away the nail folds - Be careful when filing - Avoid pushing back or cutting away the cuticles - Avoid using any irritating or allergenic cosmetic products - Avoid using the sauna - Avoid sun-bathing - When massaging, avoid kneading the arm 4. 4. At the hairdresser - Ensure that your shoulders and arms are protected from heat radiated by the dryer hood 5. In the garden - Avoid injuring yourself when working in the garden (by prickles, thorns or tools) 6. With household pets - Be sure to avoid any bites or scratches to the swollen arm 7. Sports and recreation - Avoid overexerting yourself - Avoid exposure to heat or cold - Avoid injuring yourself - While swimming is one of the activities recommended in therapy, avoid overexerting yourself when doing so 8.

A variety of common clinical conditions are associated with the development of edema, including heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure (table 1). A less common form of edema is lymphedema, which is due to an abnormality in the lymphatic system, often involves one limb, and is generally irreversible (table 2). The most common cause is interruption of the axillary lymphatic system by surgery and/or radiation therapy in women with breast cancer, resulting in the development of arm edema. The etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of lymphedema will be reviewed here, beginning with a summary of the anatomy of the lymphatic system and its role in the maintenance of fluid balance. Prevention and treatment of lymphedema and an overview of the pathophysiology and etiology of edema are presented separately. (See \"Lymphedema: Prevention and treatment\" and \"Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults\".) PHYSIOLOGY OF LYMPH FLOW - The normal capillary circulation has a small gradient favoring filtration across the capillary wall into the interstitium that varies in magnitude in different organs. There is also a variable permeability to proteins, resulting in some protein movement into the interstitium. (See \"Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults\", section on 'Capillary hemodynamics'.) The filtered, protein-enriched fluid that does not reenter the capillaries is returned to the systemic circulation by the lymphatic system [1-3]. Unlike the high pressures in the systemic circulation, lymph flow takes place in a low pressure system. Uptake of interstitial fluid begins in initial lymphatic vessels (lymphatic capillaries and precollectors) that abut the interstitial space. This process is facilitated by local arterial pulsation, skeletal muscle contraction, and unidirectional valves that prevent backward flow. The initial lymphatics merge into vessels of increasing caliber that become equipped with a smooth muscle coat that, via contraction, promotes peristaltic movement of the lymph fluid. In the extremities, there is a superficial lymphatic system that drains the skin and subcutaneous tissue and a deep system that drains subfascial structures such as muscle and bone [2,4]. The two systems of the upper extremities merge in the axilla and the two systems of the lower extremities merge in the pelvis. The major lymph vessels eventually drain into the central venous circulation. The lymph draining from both lower extremities, the gastrointestinal tract, and the left upper body (upper extremity, chest wall, upper back, shoulder, and breast) enter the venous circulation through the thoracic duct, which opens into the left venous angle between the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein (figure 1) [2]. The lymph draining from the right upper body drains into the right venous angle via the right lymphatic duct. PATHOGENESIS Edema - Edema results from an imbalance between the rate of lymph production (which reflects fluid movement out of the capillary) and the rate of return of the lymphatic fluid to the systemic circulation [1]. In the common edematous states, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and renal failure, the primary problem is increased fluid movement out of the capillary due to increased venous pressure, hypoalbuminemia, or, less often, enhanced capillary permeability. In addition, enhanced capillary filtration due to increased venous pressure is responsible for localized edema due to chronic venous disease. Lymphatic flow and contractility increase in the presence of tissue edema, which then leads to removal of some of the excess interstitial fluid. (See \"Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults\", section on 'Edema formation' and \"Pathophysiology and etiology of edema in adults\", section on 'Safety factors' and \"Clinical evaluation of lower extremity chronic venous disease\".) Lymphedema - In contrast, the major defect in most patients with lymphedema is impaired lymphatic transport due to lymphatic obliteration, as occurs with primary (hereditary) lymphatic malformations and after cancer treatments such as lymph node dissection and radiation therapy (RT) [1,3,5]. As a result, some of the filtered fluid that does not reenter the capillaries cannot be returned to the systemic circulation by the lymphatic vessels and accumulates in the interstitium. The rate of capillary filtration is normal in patients with lymphedema, not increased as in the generalized edema states [3]. ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS - The major causes of lymphedema are generally classified as primary (hereditary) or secondary (acquired), which are much more common (table 2) [1-6]. Causes of secondary lymphedema - There are a number of acquired causes of lymphedema including axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection and/or radiation, malignant obstruction, and infection. Lymph node dissection and/or radiation for breast cancer and melanoma is the most common cause in developed countries, while filariasis is the most common cause worldwide. The increasing prevalence of lymphedema in developed countries is largely due to lymph node dissection and/or radiation therapy for malignant disease [1,4,6-8]. In a review from the Stanford Lymphedema Center, which sees approximately 200 new cases of lymphedema per year, approximately 75 percent were due to malignancy or its therapy, one-half of which were related to breast cancer surgery [4]. The likelihood of developing lymphedema after axillary or inguinal node dissection is related to several factors including the number of lymph nodes removed, the extent of surgery, tumor location, local radiation therapy, delayed wound healing, postoperative infection, the development of hematoma or seroma, and obesity [8]. Examples include a swollen arm occurring after lymph node dissection for breast cancer, swollen limbs following lymph node dissection or radiation in the pelvic region for gynecologic and urologic malignancies, and face and neck swelling after treatment of head and neck cancer. Lymphedema may also result from a tumor causing lymphatic obstruction or from progressive obliteration of lymphangioles due to chronic inflammation. (See \"Classic Kaposi's sarcoma: Clinical features, staging, diagnosis, and treatment\", section on 'Skin lesions' and \"Complications of gynecologic surgery\", section on 'lymphedema and lymphocyst'.) Breast cancer therapy - The major cause of secondary lymphedema in developed countries is interruption of the axillary lymphatic system by surgery and/or RT in women with breast cancer, resulting in the development of ipsilateral arm edema [1,7]. The overall rate of arm edema is approximately 20 to 25 percent in women undergoing breast cancer surgery [7]. However, the rate varies substantially with the lymph node procedure that is performed and whether RT is used, but does not appear to differ between mastectomy versus breast conserving surgery [9]. The rate can be reduced by limiting the use and extent of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and the performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to identify women who do not need a full ALND [7,10-16]. The potential reduction in lymphedema with SLNB was illustrated in a randomized trial in which 298 patients with early breast cancer who were clinically node negative were assigned to ALND or to SLNB (followed by ALND if subsequently positive) [13]. At one year, the SLNB group had a significantly smaller increase in arm volume (14 versus 56 mL) and were significantly less likely to develop subjective lymphedema (odds ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.86). There was a greater reduction in the likelihood of developing subjective lymphedema in the node-negative SLNB patients who did not undergo ALND (odds ratio 0.20, 95% CI 0.03-0.75). The incidence of lymphedema is also significantly lower in patients who undergo SLNB alone compared to those who undergo SLNB followed by ALND (7 versus 14 percent in a randomized trial) [14,15]. In a multicenter American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial in which the procedure was performed by a wide range of surgeons, the rate of lymphedema after SLNB alone is also low [17]. Similar findings have been noted in other studies [14-16]. The timing of the completion ALND in patients with a positive SLNB (during the SLNB or delayed in another procedure) does not appear to affect the incidence of lymphedema [18]. The rate of lymphedema is increased when axillary lymph node surgery is combined with axillary RT [7,10]. In a 2001 literature review, lymphedema was much more likely in women who underwent surgery followed by axillary RT compared to surgery alone (average 41 versus 17 percent) [7]. The rate is highest in patients who underwent full ALND plus axillary RT (38 and 55 percent in two series) [19,20]. However, the field of RT is also important, with less lymphedema developing in women treated with breast irradiation than those treated with breast and axillary RT, for example [21,22]. The incidence of arm edema increases over time, which in part reflects chronic inflammatory changes that produce both subcutaneous and lymph vessel fibrosis. In one report, for example, the incidence of lymphedema in patients who underwent full ALND plus axillary radiation was 36 percent at one year and 55 percent at two years [20]. Older age, obesity, supraclavicular irradiation, and extremity injury, such as inflammatory arthritis, also appear to increase the risk of developing lymphedema and the risk of it progressing [23-25]. (See 'Inflammatory arthritis' below and 'Obesity' below.) The ipsilateral breast and trunk are also at risk for the development of secondary lymphedema. The incidence rate for breast lymphedema is 6 percent with lumpectomy alone, 23 percent when SLNB and RT are combined, and 6 to 48 percent when both ALND and RT are performed [26]. Melanoma therapy - Lymphedema is a problem after axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection in patients with melanoma [8]. Avoiding deep groin dissection, if possible, can markedly reduce the incidence of lymphedema. However, even sentinel lymph node biopsy has been associated with the development of lymphedema, occurring in 5 of 235 patients (1.7 percent) in one series [27]. (See \"Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma\", section on 'Extent of dissection and morbidity'.) Infection - Infectious causes of lymphedema are more common in tropical and subtropical regions. Lymphedema in developing countries is most often related to lymphatic obstruction from parasitic infections, with filariasis being the most common cause worldwide [3,6]. Lymphedema may be a complication of recurrent erysipelas in patients with contact dermatitis [28]. (See \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical features of lymphatic filariasis\", section on 'Lymphedema' and \"Cellulitis and erysipelas\", section on 'Recurrent cellulitis'.) Inflammatory arthritis - Upper or lower extremity lymphedema, sometimes bilateral, is a rare extra-articular manifestation of inflammatory joint disease, most often rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis [29-35]. The mechanism of lymphedema is not known, but inflammatory synovitis leading to fibrosis of lymph vessels has been proposed [36]. In some patients, the lymphedema improves with effective treatment of the arthritis [34-36]. (See \"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis\", section on 'Lymphatic obstruction' and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis\".) A similar clinical appearance in the absence of lymphoscintigraphic evidence of impaired lymphatic function may be caused by extensive tenosynovitis in patients with psoriatic arthritis [33]. Obesity - Obesity may be associated with massive localized lymphedema and also can exacerbate breast cancer related lymphedema (figure 2) [37-39]. Causes of primary lymphedema - There are three categories of primary lymphedema that are classified by their age at onset: congenital lymphedema (less than one year), lymphedema praecox (1 to 35 years), and lymphedema tarda (more than 35 years) [3,40,41]. The estimated prevalence is 1:6000 to 1:10,000 live births [1]. Congenital lymphedema and VEGFR-3 - Congenital lymphedema is a rare disorder that is characterized by lymphatic malformation at birth. One cause is Milroy disease (also called congenital hereditary lymphedema, primary congenital lymphedema, or hereditary lymphedema type I), which may also be associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia and cholestasis. It is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. The defect in most families with congenital hereditary lymphedema involves the gene (located at 5q35.3) that encodes for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3, FLT4) [42-44]. VEGFR-3 is expressed in the lymphatic endothelium, plays an important role in lymphatic development, and is activated after binding to VEGF-C and VEGF-D. The importance of this pathway is illustrated by the observation that in transgenic mice that express soluble VEGFR-3, an inhibitor of VEGF signaling, lymphangiogenesis is impaired and lymphedema results [45]. In humans, missense mutations of VEGFR-3 prevent normal lymphatic growth [44]. The VEGFR-3 pathway also may play an important role in tumor lymphangiogenesis and subsequent metastasis [46-48]. As an example, VEGF-C is overexpressed in some breast cancer cells, promoting both intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and metastases to the regional lymph nodes and lungs [46]. In one study, VEGF-C expression was detectable in some node-positive breast cancers but not in node-negative tumors [48]. In contrast, VEGF ligands to VEGFR-2 do not stimulate lymphangiogenesis [47]. In addition to Milroy disease, congenital lymphedema can also occur in a variety of other hereditary disorders with variable modes of transmission [1]. These include: X-linked - Turner syndrome in which lymphedema is the key to diagnosis in girls presenting in infancy [49,50]. Turner syndrome should be considered if two or more of the following dysmorphic features are present: webbed neck, nail dysplasia, high palate, and short fourth metacarpal [49]. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis)\".) Autosomal dominant - Noonan syndrome, which is characterized by dysmorphic features, proportionate short stature, and heart disease, most commonly pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [51]. (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonic stenosis\", section on 'Etiology'.) Lymphedema praecox - Lymphedema praecox describes primary lymphedema that typically becomes clinically apparent at or near puberty, although the age at presentation ranges from 1 to 35 years [3]. Meige disease is an autosomal dominant disorder that usually has an onset at or around puberty, and mostly affects the lower limbs [52-55]. The lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, in which pubertal-onset primary lymphedema is associated with aberrant eyelashes (distichiasis), and some other lymphedema phenotypes appear to result from mutations in the forkhead transcription factor, FOXC2 gene (located at 16q24.3), which encodes for a transcription factor [55-57]. The impairment in lymphatic function with FOXC2 mutations results from agenesis of lymphatic valves that normally prevent lymphatic backflow and from enhanced recruitment of vascular mural cells to lymphatic capillaries that may also impair lymphatic flow [58]. FOXC2 is also highly expressed in venous valves, which could explain why approximately one-half of patients with lymphedema-distichiasis also have venous insufficiency and incompetent venous valves [59]. Lymphedema tarda - Lymphedema tarda has, by definition, an onset after 35 years of age [3]. Occasional families with hereditary lymphedema present at this time, with some patients developing lymphangiosarcoma [60]. (See 'Lymphangiosarcoma' below.) CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS - The clinical manifestations of lymphedema are different in secondary and primary lymphedema. Secondary lymphedema typically involves a single limb (ie, unilateral edema), while more widespread involvement may be seen in primary lymphedema. Secondary lymphedema - Secondary lymphedema, as with lymph node dissection and/or radiation, is typically characterized by slowly progressive ipsilateral swelling of an arm following axillary node dissection or a leg following inguinal node dissection [4]. The swelling may first be apparent only in the proximal portion of the limb, or it can affect only a portion of the distal limb including the digits. Among women with breast cancer, there may also be swelling over the ipsilateral breast and/or upper chest wall. Other manifestations include a feeling of heaviness, tightness, aching or discomfort in the limb, and restricted range of motion. Secondary lymphedema in other disorders may involve more than a single limb. In rheumatoid arthritis, for example, involvement of a single limb may be most common, but both the upper and lower limbs may be affected and cases of symmetrical swelling have been reported [29-31]. Similar findings have been described with psoriatic arthritis [35]. (See \"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis\", section on 'Lymphatic obstruction'.) The onset of secondary lymphedema is usually insidious. Affected patients may initially experience aching pain at the affected area and a sense of heaviness or fullness of the limb. At this stage, lymphedema is typically soft and pitting in nature. Over time, the skin becomes dry and firm with less pitting and is fibrous to palpation. (See 'Classification' below.) The clinical hallmark of more severe lymphedema is the presence of cutaneous and subcutaneous thickening, as manifested by cutaneous fibrosis, peau d'orange, and a positive Stemmer sign, which refers to the examiner being unable to tent (ie, lift) the skin at the base of the upper surface of the digits, usually the second toe or finger, in the affected extremity (figure 3) [1]. These findings as well as localized involvement are clearly different from those in generalized edematous states, such as heart failure and the nephrotic syndrome (table 3). (See \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults\".) Primary lymphedema - The primary forms of lymphedema have a relative lack of fibrosis that permits greater amounts of edema to form than in secondary disease [61]. (See 'Causes of primary lymphedema' above.) The sites of involvement in primary lymphedema vary with the cause: Congenital lymphedema tends to involve one or both lower extremities, but can also involve the upper extremities, and even the face [3,55]. Lymphedema praecox is usually confined to the lower extremities (particularly the foot and calf); however, involvement limited to one upper extremity has been described [3,53,55]. Lymphedema tarda most often involves both lower extremities [62,63]. Classification - Several groups have developed classification schemes to describe the severity of lymphedema [2,5,64,65]. The classification scheme of the International Society of Lymphology involves two criteria to diagnose and classify lymphedema: the \"softness\" or \"firmness\" of the limb (reflecting fibrotic soft tissue changes); and the outcome after 24 hours of elevation [5]. Pitting is variable in patients with lymphedema. Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Testing for pitting involves applying firm pressure to the edematous tissue for at least five seconds. If an indentation remains after the pressure is released, pitting edema is present. Stage I - Stage I is characterized by the accumulation of fluid that has a relative high protein content (in comparison with \"venous\" edema) and that subsides with 24-hour limb elevation (figure 4). The appearance is that of soft edema that may pit, with no fibrosis. This is sometimes called reversible edema. Stage II - In stage II (also called spontaneously irreversible lymphedema), 24-hour limb elevation alone rarely reduces soft tissue swelling (figure 5). Late in stage II, the limb may not pit as fibrosis progresses. Stage III - Stage III is characterized by lymphostatic elephantiasis, where pitting is absent, and by trophic skin changes such as fat deposits, acanthosis, and warty overgrowths (figure 3). Within each stage, severity based upon volume differences can be assessed as minimal (<20 percent increase), moderate (20 to 40 percent increase), or severe (>40 percent increase). (See 'Limb circumference and volume' below.) An increasing number of lymphologists recognize an earlier stage of lymphedema, termed stage 0, which refers to a subclinical or latent condition where swelling is not evident despite impaired lymphatic transport [2,5]. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some report a feeling of heaviness in the limb. Stage 0 may exist for months or years before the onset of overt lymphedema [5]. The American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) uses girth as an anthropometric measurement to classify lymphedema. The maximum girth difference between the affected and unaffected limb is used to determine the class of lymphedema. Mild lymphedema is a maximum girth difference of less than 3 centimeters (cm); moderate lymphedema is 3 to 5 cm differential; and severe lymphedema is a differential of greater than 5 cm [66]. Another classification scheme, the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), is based upon both the response to limb elevation and the presence of functional impairment [67]. Complications - The clinical manifestations of lymphedema may be affected by confounding conditions such as venous insufficiency, morbid obesity, and occult trauma [5]. In addition, cellulitis and lymphangiosarcoma are potential complications and psychosocial morbidity is common. Skin infection - Lymphedematous skin is at risk for breakdown and subsequent infection, which may be recurrent and due in part to the protein-rich lymph providing a medium for bacterial growth. The types of infection include cellulitis, erysipelas, and lymphangitis [3,68-72]. Cellulitis is a well described complication of lymphedema, particularly in patients who have undergone axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection. The development of cellulitis is related to impaired lymphatic function, and lymphedema (even if subclinical) is a risk factor [73,74]. Typical manifestations include erythema, pain, and tenderness; systemic signs, such as fever, may not be present. In addition, lymphedema can masquerade as infectious cellulitis [75]. The range of motion of the infected limb may become restricted and interfere with lifestyle. The texture of the skin may also change and become hyperkeratotic with verrucous and vesicular skin lesions. These lesions are characteristically associated with elephantiasis. Lymphangiosarcoma - A rare secondary malignant tumor, called lymphangiosarcoma, can occur in patients with chronic lymphedema, usually those with massive and protracted edema [76]. It is classically seen in the postmastectomy, lymphedematous arm (Stewart-Treves syndrome) [77-79]. It has also been described with primary lymphedema and chronic filarial lymphedema [60,80,81]. The tumor originates in vascular endothelial cells within chronic lymphedema, not the lymphatic vessels [78]. It may initially appear as blue-red or purple skin lesions with a macular or papular shape. Multiple lesions are common and subcutaneous nodules may appear. Such skin lesions should be carefully evaluated in patients with chronic lymphedema. (See \"Pathogenetic factors in soft tissue and bone sarcomas\" and \"Breast sarcomas\".) Quality of life - Lymphedema results in psychological morbidity and a reduced quality of life including aspects of emotional, functional, physical and social well being [82,83]. Psychological problems seen in women with chronic lymphedema after treatment for breast cancer include anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, social avoidance, and exacerbation of existing psychiatric illness. DIAGNOSIS General principles - The diagnosis of lymphedema is largely based upon the history and physical examination. Careful measurements are necessary since patients often perceive a greater degree of lymphedema than detected by direct measurement [15,84]. In adults, the presence of secondary lymphedema is usually suggested by the following findings: Localized rather than generalized edema. The edema is typically characterized by slowly progressive ipsilateral (unilateral) swelling of an arm following axillary node dissection or a leg following inguinal node dissection [4]. Other causes of localized limb swelling, such as deep vein thrombosis, malignancy (which may obstruct proximal lymphatic vessels), and infection should be evaluated with appropriate studies. Patients in endemic areas should be tested for filarial infection. (See \"Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of lymphatic filariasis\".) A history of a trauma or cancer treatment, such as axillary or inguinal lymph node dissection and/or RT, and the absence of a cause of generalized edema (eg, heart failure, nephrotic syndrome). (See 'Secondary lymphedema' above.) A positive Stemmer sign in which the examiner is unable to lift the skin, or has difficulty lifting the skin of the dorsum of the fingers or toes as compared to the contralateral limb. It is possible to have a false negative Stemmer sign, but there cannot be a false positive sign. A positive Stemmer sign is always indicative of lymphedema [85]. A unique finding in lymphedema is the presence of cutaneous and subcutaneous thickening which are not present in patients with stage I and early stage II disease [1]. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and 'Classification' above.) The edema should be classified as pitting or nonpitting. Pitting reflects movement of the excess interstitial water in response to pressure. Testing for pitting involves applying firm pressure to the edematous tissue for at least five seconds. If an indentation remains after the pressure is released, pitting edema is present. Nonpitting edema is suggestive of lymphedema or venous insufficiency. However, the presence of pitting does NOT exclude lymphedema since, as noted above, pitting is present in lymphedema patients with stage I disease and in some with stage II disease. (See 'Classification' above and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults\", section on 'Venous insufficiency or thrombosis' and \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults\", section on 'Nonpitting edema'.) Occasional patients have both lymphedema and generalized edema, such as breast cancer patients who have undergone axillary lymph node dissection and have heart failure as a result of treatment with cardiotoxic agents (trastuzumab or doxorubicin). In this setting, concurrent lymphedema is suggested by more prominent swelling in the ipsilateral arm. (See \"Cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab\" and \"Cardiotoxicity of anthracycline-like chemotherapy agents\".) Limb circumference and volume - Measurements of limb circumference and volume are common methods used for the diagnosis of limb edema and for monitoring during and after therapy, particularly arm edema in patients with breast cancer [5]. Arm volume can be measured by the water displacement method or estimated by taking several circumferential measurements at standard distances [9,86,87]. Circumferential measurements, at the same points on the affected and contralateral arm, are a simple and inexpensive method to estimate edema. Measurements in the arm are made at four points: the metacarpal-phalangeal joints, the wrists, 10 cm distal to the lateral epicondyles, and 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyles [88]. A difference of more than 2 cm between the affected and contralateral arm is considered clinically significant. Changes in arm circumference may be more difficult to detect in obese women and are subject to variation related to differences in muscle mass due to hand dominance (which can be avoided by taking circumferential measurements of both arms at baseline) and shifting of fluid proximally or distally due to arm positioning and/or compression. Water displacement detects changes in arm volume of less than 1 percent, and a volume difference of 200 mL or more between the affected and opposite arms is typically considered as a cutoff point to define lymphedema [9,19,87]. Standard model water displacement arm volumeters are large, prone to leaks, and expensive. An alternative, home-made, and smaller device has been developed that is as accurate and is suitable for home or office use (figure 6 and table 3) [89]. Measurement of arm volume rather than arm circumference has been used in some of the clinical trials that tested treatment strategies for arm edema. However, it is not clear if there is an advantage to following arm volume rather than arm circumference. Although there is some evidence that measurement of arm volume is a more accurate diagnostic test, particularly with leg edema, circumferential measurements have shown a high correlation with the water displacement method [9,86,87]. Imaging - Imaging of the lymphatic system is usually not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of lymphedema if the diagnosis is obvious. If imaging is performed to distinguish lymphedema from nonlymphatic causes of edema, lymphoscintigraphy (radionuclide imaging) is the preferred test [4,90-92] and has largely replaced lymphangiography, which is more invasive and technically difficult [4,92]. Lymphoscintigraphy - With lymphoscintigraphy, radioactive tracers are injected subcutaneously or intradermally in the web space of the upper or lower extremities [4]. Imaging is performed at 30 to 60 minutes after injection. The patient then performs a stress activity (such as walking, massage, or squeezing a ball for about 20 minutes), which is followed by repeat imaging. Criteria for impaired lymphatic function include delayed, asymmetric, or absent visualization of the regional lymph nodes and dermal backflow [4]. The protocol for lymphoscintigraphy is not standardized and differs among major centers. Quantitation of regional lymph node accumulation of the tracer appears to be more sensitive than qualitative lymphoscintigraphy (100 versus 70 percent in a series of 219 patients with secondary or primary lymphedema) [92]. All cases missed with qualitative lymphoscintigraphy were mild grade I disease. (See 'Classification' above.) MRI and CT - Other imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging and computerized tomography, may complement information obtained via lymphoscintigraphy [1]. Such imaging provides anatomic and nodal detail that is otherwise not available. These techniques are most helpful in ruling out obstructive causes of lymphedema, such a cancer recurrence in a nodal region. Bioimpedance spectroscopy - Bioimpedance spectroscopy is a reliable and accurate tool to determine arm volume by comparing the composition of fluid compartments using resistance to electrical current [93-96]. It has been mostly used to evaluate arm edema in patients with breast cancer [97], but impedance ratio thresholds for lymphedema of the legs have also been established [98]. Although BIS has not been widely used, at least in the US, the US FDA has approved BIS for lymphedema assessment and the procedure has received a category III CPT code. It remains to be seen whether BIS will now receive wider clinical application. Optoelectronic volumetry - Volume measurements can also be assessed utilizing an infrared optoelectronic assessment. This is a computerized analysis that uses infrared beams to scan the limb and calculate a volume. The optoelectronic volumetry method has been found to have better reliability than water displacement volumetry in the measurement of upper extremity lymphedema [99,100]. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS - UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon. Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.) Beyond the Basics topics (see \"Patient information: Lymphedema after breast cancer surgery\") SUMMARY - Lymphedema is caused by impaired lymphatic transport due to lymphatic obliteration, which occurs with lymphatic malformations, lymphatic surgery or radiation, and certain infections such as filariasis. These mechanisms are different from the mechanisms of edema in generalized edematous states such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. There are two types of lymphedema: primary (or hereditary) and secondary (or acquired). Primary lymphedema is classified by age of onset and includes congenital lymphedema, lymphedema praecox, and lymphedema tarda. (See 'Causes of primary lymphedema' above.) The major cause of secondary lymphedema in developed countries is interruption of the lymphatic system by surgery and/or radiation in the treatment of breast cancer and melanoma. Other causes of secondary lymphedema include obstruction by tumor, infection (filariasis), recurrent cellulitis, and connective tissue disease. (See 'Causes of secondary lymphedema' above.) The risk of developing lymphedema in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer can be minimized by limiting the use and extent of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and axillary radiation therapy (RT). The incidence of lymphedema with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is significantly lower than with ALND. (See 'Breast cancer therapy' above.) The diagnosis of lymphedema is largely based upon the history and physical examination. In adults, the presence of secondary lymphedema is usually suggested by localized rather than generalized edema, the presence of cutaneous and subcutaneous thickening, a positive Stemmer sign, and a history of an appropriate cause. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above and 'Diagnosis' above.) The measurement of limb circumference is a common method used for the diagnosis of lymphedema in women with breast cancer. Imaging of the lymphatic system is usually not necessary if the diagnosis is obvious. (See 'Diagnosis' above.) Use of UpToDate is subject to the Subscription and License Agreement.

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2012 09:13PM - edited Oct 7, 2012 09:49PM by kira My issues with the app: 1) It only lists LANA certified therapists, not all qualified therapists, and LANA certification has been falling over the last decade due to the fact that the test costs money and offers no tangible benefits. A tiny fraction of qualified therapists take the test. So the three LANA LE therapists in my area showed up. I know one is horrible. The other two are great (one is my therapist), but I also know of a number of fully trained LE therapists who are far superior to the the LANA certified woman who popped up. (The head of the LE clinic at the largest hospital in the state brought Klose to our area, where I took the class with her. I discussed this LANA therapist with the head--who is now LANA eligible, but not yet certified, yet a great therapist, and she concurred with my assessment.) 2) The ACS information: ARGHHH They have the page that says it's okay and expected to swell for 6-12 weeks after surgery and radiation and although the quiz does say to contact your doctor, the page on the app just says to elevate and squeeze your fist--for up to 3 months of arm swelling!  Binney and I had contacted the ACS about concerns and they did modify the pages, but somehow this one skipped our observation, and I would bet it is why the stupid \"After the Shock\" said LE swelling normally goes away in 6-12 weeks. www.cancer.org/Treatment/Treat... Right after surgery, the affected arm or breast area may swell. This swelling is usually short-term and slowly goes away over the next 6 to 12 weeks. Talk to your doctor or nurse about what you should expect and what you should do. These tips may help ease the swelling: Use your affected arm as you normally would when combing your hair, bathing, dressing, and eating. Put your affected arm above the level of your heart 2 or 3 times a day and keep it there for 45 minutes. Lie down to do this, and fully support your arm. Place your arm up on pillows so that your hand is higher than your wrist and your elbow is a little higher than your shoulder. Exercise your affected arm while it is supported above the level of your heart by opening and closing your hand 15 to 25 times. Repeat this 3 to 4 times a day. This helps reduce swelling by pumping lymph fluid out of your arm through the undamaged lymph vessels. To get back your normal shoulder and arm movement, start exercising your affected arm about a week after surgery. Be sure to talk to your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist before doing any exercises. For most people, the full range of motion is regained within 4 to 6 weeks. Keep in mind that the arm may swell if you have radiation therapy after surgery, and the swelling may last longer than normal. Radiation may also cause some swelling in the chest and breast toward the end of the treatment. In most cases, this swelling is short-term and will slowly go away. During treatment and up to 18 months afterward, you should do simple stretching exercises each day to keep full movement in your chest, arm, and shoulder. Women who have had many lymph nodes removed and women who have had radiation therapy may have a higher risk of developing lymphedema.

      "Content": "Sep 21, 2013 05:49PM - edited Sep 21, 2013 05:50PM by kira Well, I went on LBBC and it looks like Andrea Cheville did not answer our questions, but two PT's from Philadelphia did--(I think Andrea Cheville is great, and a wonderful lecturer, but why is she always kind of missing in action when we ask her for help? JMHO) http://www.lbbc.org/Learning-From-Others/Ask-the-Expert/2013-07-Understanding-Lymphedema Lymphedema is an important side effect to know about as you go through breast cancer treatment. During the month of July, Living Beyond Breast Cancer experts Joy Cohn, PT, CLT-LANA, and Stephanie Duczak, PT, CLT-LANA, answered your questions about what lymphedema is, what causes it, ways to reduce risk, and what treatment and management options are available. Question: What causes lymphedema to flare up? I was doing pretty well with the swelling in my hand and arm for over a year. All of a sudden the swelling returned, especially in my hand. Ms. Cohn: Any event that leads to additional blood flow into the area at risk may be the inciting event for swelling to occur: excess heat, excess activity when the limb is not used to it, infection (cellulitis) and trauma are common inciting events. Sometimes we can\u2019t identify a specific event, but the very slow accumulation of excess fluid and protein finally exceeds the tissue's capacity to hold the fluid. We speak about lymphedema having stages; one is called \u2018latency\u2019 because in this case there is additional fluid already in the tissues, but we don\u2019t see actual swelling because the tissues can have up to 30\u201340 percent extra fluid saturating them before actual swelling is seen. In this stage a person may feel heaviness, achiness or unusual sensations. If these symptoms are in your limb and they last for a week or more, it might be a good idea to see your doctor or a therapist who specializes in lymphedema treatment. Many women have these kind of sensations intermittently for many years before a swelling is actually apparent. Back to top Question: What are your specific strategies for long-term lymphedema management both for patients and physical therapists with respect to wrapping versus sleeves, pumps, massages, etc. and why? Please include any others not listed above. Ms. Cohn: It is my belief that CONSISTENCY is the key to successfully managing lymphedema. Well-fitting daytime compression garments are key because they are used when you are active with more blood flow in the tissues. In addition, the arm is \u2018hanging down,\u2019 encouraging blood to pool in the limb. A compression garment reduces the leakage of fluid from the blood vessels AND enhances the pumping action of the muscles, removing more fluid from the limb throughout the day. Compression bandaging is considered the \u2018gold standard\u2019 for managing swelling, but many women choose to use bandage alternatives at night: custom or adjustable low-stretch garments that support the tissue while sleeping.  Why should compression be used both day and night? It is because the tissue fluid that must be managed is produced by our blood flow and our blood is flowing both day and night! Self manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is practiced by some women, but it is difficult to be as effective as a therapist is with this technique. Some women seek out practitioners for regular MLD as a maintenance treatment. Unfortunately, it is almost never covered by medical insurance and in any case, it does not take the place of daily self care: compression and meticulous skin care. An analogy would be that we get our teeth professionally cleaned twice a year, but that can\u2019t substitute for brushing daily twice a day. Back to top Question: Since my surgery was over 3 months ago, should I still be having so much swelling?  Should I consider going to a lymphedema specialist?  Ms. Cohn: Yes, it is normal to see some degree of postoperative swelling and many women also will experience some fluctuation in swelling during their adjuvant treatment.However, 3 months of swelling should be evaluated by your doctor and a lymphedema therapist because lymphedema is always easier to treat when it is addressed early on. Many women are unaware that lymphedema can also occur in the breast on the side of the cancer and is also treated very successfully using the same type of treatment used to treat arm lymphedema. Back to top Question: What are the best exercises? Anything to avoid in terms of physical activity? Ms. Cohn: Women do all of the usual kinds of exercise after treatment for breast cancer! However, recent research has given us some good guidelines regarding how to return to (or start!) an exercise program. The PAL trial was a research study conducted in Philadelphia, Pa., which had women do regular weight lifting after being treated for breast cancer. There were women both WITH lymphedema and AT RISK for lymphedema in this study. They were able to safely exercise following a program that included a warm up of light aerobic exercise, flexibility exercises, core strengthening exercises, weight lifting and then flexibility, and cool down exercises again. The mantra of this program was: START LOW and PROGRESS SLOW. Both the AMA (American Medical Association) and the ACSM (American College of Sports Medicine) strongly recommend exercise for cancer patients at any stage during their journey.  They state that \u2018Exerciseis Medicine\u2019 and research is providing stronger evidence all the time that it can help with cancer fatigue, reduce the tendency towards weight gain after breast cancer treatment and reduce the risk of a recurrence of cancer. Seek out an evaluation by your MD and a physical therapist if you have musculoskeletal problems or have never exercised so that you can learn how to exercise correctly!  In terms of avoiding exercise? It is recommended that people at risk for lymphedema should avoid hot yoga (Bikram) because it will potentially cause an increased tendency to edema. Back to top Question: Is full-body lymphedema a real diagnosis? What is the best way to address it? Ms. Cohn: What you describe is very rare. Often swelling throughout the body is an indication of a systemic condition, which should be evaluated by a physician. Please consider a medical workup to rule out cardiac, renal or other medical conditions that are more likely as causes of what you describe. Back to top Question: There seems to be some controversy concerned with wearing a compression sleeve. If you have had lymphedema at one point but no longer have swelling, is it necessary to keep wearing the sleeve other than for exercise and flying? Ms. Cohn: If you have never had lymphedema, there is no evidence to suggest that it is necessary to wear one in ANY situation. If you have experienced swelling before, it is considered prudent to wear one when flying or doing heavy exercise. HOWEVER, if you wear a sleeve for exercise or flying WEAR A GLOVE OR GAUNTLET to prevent swelling in your hand. In the 17 years that I have treated lymphedema - the women I saw who developed swelling on a plane were wearing a sleeve and no handpiece and their hand swelled up! Wearing a sleeve, alone, on a plane is like putting a tourniquet on your arm. Back to top Question: I find wearing my lymphedema glove and sleeve uncomfortable. Are there any other options to help keep the swelling down? Ms. Cohn: For daytime, a sleeve and glove are probably the best choice. There are many different styles of garments and fabrics that may be appropriate for you and would be more comfortable to wear. Have you had treatment to reduce the congestion in your arm before you obtained the garments you wear? Garments are usually not comfortable if worn on an arm that is congested. Also, do you wear compression garments at night?  Bandaging or a bandage alternative at night may help to make your daytime compression garments feel more comfortable, when your arm is less swollen when you put them on in the morning. Back to top Question: I had breast cancer twice, in 1980 and 1992 (a new primary the second time). I did not develop lymphedema until 2012.  Is this unusual? I know this is a lifetime risk, but I seem to be the only one I can find with such late-onset lymphedema. Ms. Cohn: The best research paper published regarding your question found that the majority of lymphedema occurs within the first 3 years after diagnosis; however, they found that there was a small, but steady accrual of cases in the following years. I personally treated a woman who first had swelling 30 years after her treatment for breast cancer. You are correct in saying that there is a lifetime risk, so I always counsel women to just \u2018live smart\u2019. The best information in this regard can be found in the Position Paper on Risk Reduction available from the National Lymphedema Network at their website, www.lymphnet.org.  Back to top Question: I have been terribly lucky and have not had lymphedema much at all, but I am now terrified to travel by airplane as I have heard that flying can bring it on. Would wearing a sleeve help? Would one use a gauntlet as well? Any other suggestions? I know that it's easier to get recurrences of lymphedema once you've had it, so my goal is to not get it in the first place. Ms. Duczak: The change in cabin pressure during flying alters circulation in the body, increasing the chance for swelling to occur. The sedentary nature of a flight in addition to the tendency for dehydration and need for heavy lifting (i.e. luggage) also increase the risk.  While there are no specific recommendations for wearing compression to prevent lymphedema during air travel, I think use of a compression sleeve is appropriate in this situation. It must be fitted properly \u2014 I recommend you see a lymphedema therapist or a certified fitter. I do recommend that you use a gauntlet, as well, because if swelling does develop, there is a chance it will include the hand.  Move your arms throughout the flight and stay well hydrated. The risk of swelling from flying is only considered to be while you are in the air, but I usually recommend people keep the sleeve and gauntlet on until you reach the baggage claim and have picked up your luggage. You can be sure your circulation will have stabilized by that time. Back to top Question: Do you know why medical supply places require a prescription to buy a sleeve \u2014 or does that vary by state perhaps? Can I buy one online without a prescription?    Ms. Duczak: Medical supply companies usually require a prescription in order to bill insurance and to ensure that you receive the appropriate type of compression for your lymphedema (they are not medical professionals and cannot prescribe garments.) You can buy compression garments online without a prescription, but I would recommend being evaluated by your physician or a lymphedema therapist prior to doing so. A trained medical professional should determine what compression garment is right for you. A compression sleeve or glove that does not fit properly or is not the right compression level will not control your swelling and could worsen your condition.  Back to top Question: Is lymphatic drainage massage encouraged or discouraged? What about dry brushing?  Ms. Duczak: Manual lymphatic drainage is encouraged for patients who have or are at risk for developing lymphedema. Research supports its use to improve lymphatic circulation. It is usually incorporated into lymphedema treatment and is taught to the patient for maintenance of the arm. I don\u2019t know of any evidence for dry brushing helping with lymphedema or lymphatic circulation at this time. Dry brushing does likely increase circulation by increasing blood flow, but not of the lymphatic system specifically.  Back to top Question: Would you address the number of axillary lymph nodes removed and risk of lymphedema? It seems that some resources say a sentinel node biopsy of 1 or 2 nodes would be a low risk for lymphedema. Other resources say that with removing more than 10 or 11 nodes the risk for lymphedema increases.  Ms. Duczak: It is true that the more axillary lymph nodes you have removed, the greater your risk of developing lymphedema. Removing 1\u20132 may not have as much of an impact as removing 10\u201315. With that being said, removal of lymph nodes is not the only risk factor for developing lymphedema. For example, many women who have sentinel node biopsies undergo radiation therapy. Radiation therapy significantly increases the risk of developing lymphedema due to the trauma and scarring that occurs to the lymphatic vessels. Trauma, infection and obesity are also risk factors. So while it is true that the more lymph nodes you have removed, the greater your risk, there are still other factors that you should consider in your overall risk for lymphedema. Back to top Question: I have had chemo, bilateral mastectomy, [removal of] lymph nodes (4) and radiation in 2011 \u2013 2012. I have left-side armpit and trunk swelling, will this ever go away?  Ms. Duczak: Surgery and radiation cause a lot of tissue trauma and can cause swelling in the chest, trunk and arm. Typically, swelling after surgery and radiation therapy will reduce in 6 months to 1 year. However, sometimes it can be a little longer. Lymph node removal and radiation therapy both increase your risk of developing lymphedema, so I would recommend that you be evaluated by your physician or a lymphedema therapist to determine if this could possibly be a lymphatic condition. Whether it is regular swelling or lymphedema, there are treatment options that could help reduce this.  Back to top Question: Where online can I go to get proper exercise information for making me better and more comfortable?  Ms. Duczak: This is a very general question, as I do not know exactly what your complaints are or what treatment you have had. The websites for the National Lymphedema Network ( www.lymphnet.org) and the American Cancer Society ( www.cancer.org) give general information about returning to exercise after cancer treatment and reducing your risk for developing lymphedema. Flexibility, strength and endurance all are significantly impacted by cancer treatment. This can increase your risk of injury when returning to exercise. Many patients do well with a short course of physical therapy, to address their specific issues and to get assistance on returning to a safe and appropriate exercise program.  Back to top Question: I only had 2 nodes removed during my sentinel node biopsy. Am I really at risk of lymphedema? How high is my risk? Ms. Duczak: Having a sentinel node biopsy significantly reduces your risk for developing lymphedema. The fewer nodes removed, the better. With that being said there are other risk factors that can increase your likelihood of developing lymphedema. Radiation therapy, trauma to the arm, infection and obesity are some of these risk factors.  So if you have only had two nodes removed, I would say you are low risk, but if you have any of these other risk factors your risk will be higher. The more factors you have, the higher the risk.  Back to top Question: I do have sleeves, and I wear one every day.  I want to know if it is safe to use my arm for things like using a hammer, pulling weeds, or working out with weights while I have it on?  Ms. Duczak: All these activities can be safe for you if they are done properly. The motto is \u201cstart low - progress slow.\u201d You want to gradually increase your activity level, monitoring for any symptoms or changes in your arm (i.e. pain, swelling, feelings of fullness or heaviness).  Don\u2019t go out and do all these activities on the same day. Break them up on to different days to give your arm a break. And if you are weight training, you should start with the lowest weight possible and work up gradual",

My jovipak glove was sent to insurance at close to $800. Some of the sites will sell the jovipak non-custom sleeve--at around $300. The key seems to be to get a good DME person who knows the products and can order you what you need. I know Binney is not happy with the policy of refusing to communicate with the patients. I've used two DME companies and one was clueless, the other is great. Some therapists won't order DME, others will. I used to work in insurance, and it's a game--the companies mark up the product significantly, the insurance reduces it and asks for a co-pay--and likely your copay is close to the wholesale price, only due to the DME companies' policies, that's a secret price. The uninformed DME person sold me a Juzo gauntlet--they sell on-line for $15, the 1101 model, and submitted it as \"custom\"--I crossed that out when I signed the form--and they charged insurance $50, and my copay is $10. I'd rather buy it on-line. It's a horrible irony that we, the patients, who understand our conditions and needs are at the mercy of the DME companies, providers and the insurance industry. I hope we can somehow make Solaris and Jovipak stop treating the patients as pariahs.  (And even my better DME person \"forgot\" to fax the order to jovi--and when the glove didn't come three weeks later, they actually took my call and rushed the order. The DME person is very informed, but will drop the ball if you don't watch it--she's about 70 miles away, and I finally drove to her office to straighten things out--I was spending all my time at the post office, mailing back the wrong gloves they were sending. Insult to injury.) I wish there was a way we could band together and let Solaris and Jovi know that refusing to deal with patients is not customer friendly or really even ethical.  Kira ",

Patients, of course, detest it even more. The limb swelling that is the primary symptom of lymphedema comes about because surgery on the axillary lymph nodes (the lymph nodes under the arm) that is part and parcel of surgery for breast cancer can interrupt lymph vessels and cause backup of lymph fluid in the affected arm. This backup has consequences, including skin changes, a tendency towards infections, and, in extreme cases, elephantiasis (which is, fortunately, rarely seen these days as a result of breast cancer surgery). Unfortunately, lymphedema is incurable, and the risk of developing it never goes away after breast surgery. Lymphedema used to be much more of a problem back in the old days (say, more than 10-15 years ago), when surgery for breast cancer routinely involved an axillary dissection, or removal of most of the lymph nodes under the arm. (For surgery geeks, in breast surgery level 1 and 2 lymph nodes out of three levels, unless, of course, leven 3 nodes are grossly involved with tumor, in which case they\u2019re taken too.) Frequently radiation therapy was needed as well, and the combination of axillary dissection and radiation therapy could produce a risk of lymphedema as high as 50%. Of course, in recent years, sentinel lymph node biopsy, which involves removing many fewer nodes (usually 1-3) has supplanted axillary dissection for most cases of breast cancer, and, consistent with fewer nodes being taken, the risk of lymphedema from sentinel lymph node biopsy is much lower. However, none of this means that lymphedema isn\u2019t still a problem after breast surgery; it\u2019s just less of a problem. There are only a few basic strategies for treating lymphedema, sometimes called decongestive lymphatic therapy. For the most part, these treatments involve physical therapy, compression sleeves to \u201csqueeze\u201d the fluid out of the affected limb, and sometimes the use of mechanical compression stockings that \u201cmilk\u201d the fluid back. It\u2019s all very inconvenient and unpleasant, and there\u2019s no doubt that this particular complication can take a major toll on a patient\u2019s quality of life and sometimes even lead to hospitalizations for infection. It might be less of a problem than it was in years past, thanks to less invasive surgery, but it\u2019s still a problem, and it needs better treatments. Acupuncture is not one of them. Not that proponents of acupuncture don\u2019t try to convince people that acupuncture is a treatment for lymphedema. To be honest, knowing the mechanism by which lymphedema develops, I can never quite figure out why anyone would think that acupuncture would do anything for lymphedema. How, pray tell, would sticking needles into the body, often in areas of the body not involved by lymphedema, be expected to cause lymphedema to get better? Yet, acupuncturists keep claiming that acupuncture can be used to effectively treat lymphedema. Indeed, if there\u2019s one image that causes me to cringe when I see it, it\u2019s the image of needles being stuck into a lymphedematous arm, often with the acupuncturist not wearing gloves. In any case, just yesterday there appeared news of the publication of a study out of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) examining acupuncture as a treatment for breast cancer surgery-associated lymphedema in the ASCO Post: Arm lymphedema affects approximately 30% of breast cancer survivors, with rates increasing with longer follow-up and cases presenting well beyond the active treatment period. Lymphedema is observed even with use of less-invasive surgical techniques for staging, and risk is further increased by such factors as radiation therapy, positive lymph node status, increased tumor burden, postoperative seroma or infection, obesity, and increased age. Current treatments for lymphedema after breast cancer treatment are expensive and require ongoing intervention. As reported by Barrie R. Cassileth, MS, PhD, of the Integrative Medicine Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and colleagues in Cancer, acupuncture may be an effective treatment. The study appeared in the journal Cancer and was entitled Acupuncture in the treatment of upper-limb lymphedema: Results of a pilot study. It\u2019s as fine an example of quackademia as I\u2019ve ever seen, its lead investigator being our old friend Barrie Cassileth, the director of the integrative medicine department at MSKCC. Just put her name in the search box of this blog, and you\u2019ll see that, although Dr. Cassileth is very much against cancer quackery like laetrile, shark cartilage, Entelev/Cantron, various oxygen therapies (such as hyperbaric oxygen or various means of administering hydrogen peroxide), and even \u201cenergy therapies,\u201d which Cassileth admits have no evidence to support them. Of course, acupuncture is an \u201cenergy therapy.\u201d It does, after all, postulate that inserting fine needles into pathways in the body called \u201cmeridians\u201d somehow alters the flow of magical, mystical life force energy known as qi, to curative intent. Yet Cassileth really loves acupuncture, so much so that she\u2019s conducted quite a few studies on acupuncture in cancer patients. For example, there was this one on acupuncture for hot flashes a few years ago. So this time around, it\u2019s acupuncture for lymphedema. Truly, acupuncture is the therapy that can do anything, which is consistent with its being quackery. Certainly, no one has ever postulated a mechanism by which acupuncture can do all the things claimed for it, including (but not limited to) relieving pain, relieving hot flashes, treating infertility, improving asthma symptoms, and, of course, treating lymphedema. What\u2019s the common unifying biological mechanism that could explain therapeutic effects in all these diseases and conditions? There is none, at least none that any acupuncturist has ever been able to explain convincingly to me, nor was any claimed in the ClinicalTrials.gov entry for this. So what does this study purport to show? It\u2019s a pilot study involving 33 patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema for at least six months but not longer than five years. This time period was chosen to make sure that the subjects were all out of the immediate postoperative period but not so many years out that they started to develop skin complications from chronic lymphedema. These patients all underwent twice weekly 30 minute acupuncture sessions for four weeks as follows: Alcohol swabs were applied prior to insertion of sterile single-use filiform needles (32-36 gauge; 30-40 mm in length, Tai Chi brand, made in China and distributed by Lhasa OMS, Weymouth, MA) that penetrate 5-10 mm into the skin. A total of 14 needles were inserted: 4 in both affected and unaffected limbs, 2 in acupuncture points on both legs, and 2 in unilateral points on the torso. Selected acupuncture points (Fig. 1) were stimulated manually by gentle rotation of the needles with lift and thrust. The acupuncturists did not intentionally seek to achieve a de qi sensation. Specific acupuncture points used in this study were determined on the basis of historical context, the published literature, and the consensus of our experienced group of MSKCC staff acupuncturists.[18-20, 34, 37] Many of these acupoints are used to treat pain, weakness, and motor impairment; others are traditionally used to drain \u201cdampness,\u201d a TCM concept similar to edema. Did I just read what I thought I read? Seriously? The rationale for choosing these points was based on their being related to traditional Chinese medicine concepts to drain \u201cdampness\u201d? This is utter nonsense, the sort of silliness in which quackademic medicine corrupts academic medicine with concepts that have nothing to do with science. Just read about \u201cdampness\u201d in TCM: In nature, dampness soaks the ground and everything that comes in contact with it, and stagnation results. Once something becomes damp, it can take a long time for it to dry out again, especially in wet weather. The yin pathogenic influence of dampness has similar qualities: It is persistent and heavy, and it can be difficult to resolve. A person who spends a lot of time in the rain, lives in a damp environment, or sleeps on the ground may be susceptible to external dampness. Similarly, a person who eats large amounts of ice cream, cold foods and drinks, greasy foods, and sweets is prone to imbalances of internal dampness. Dampness has both tangible and intangible aspects. Tangible dampness includes phlegm, edema (fluid retention), and discharges. Intangible dampness includes a person\u2019s subjective feelings of heaviness and dizziness. A \u201cslippery\u201d pulse and a greasy tongue coating usually accompany both types of dampness. In general, symptoms of dampness in the body include water retention, swelling, feelings of heaviness, coughing or vomiting phlegm, and skin rashes that ooze or are crusty (as in eczema). As I said, none of this has anything to do with science. So, based on a TCM concept of \u201cdampness\u201d being tortuously related to lymphedema, quackademics at MSKCC subjected patients to acupuncture and measured their limb circumferences. There are a few ways to measure lymphedema. One is water displacement, in which the subject puts her arm into a cylinder of water, and the volume displaced is measured. This method isn\u2019t used much anymore because it\u2019s messy and inconvenient to do, although it is arguably the most accurate. In most cases, lymphedema is measured by comparing the circumference of each arm at different locations defined by anatomy. Generally, this is done in four locations, the metacarpal-phalangeal joints, the wrist, 10 cm distal to the lateral epicondyles, and 15 cm proximal to the lateral epicondyles. Differences of 2 cm or more at any point compared with the contralateral arm are considered by some experts to be clinically significant. The authors used a two-point technique performed by trained research assistants 10 cm above (upper arm) and 5 cm below (lower arm) the olecranon process using nonstretch tape measures, which is said to be as sensitive and specific as any other methods. The median age of subjects was 55, and they were a mean of 3.9 years out from surgery. They were on the obese side, with a mean BMI of 30.4, which is above 30 and thus in the obese range. The results were as follows. A 30% or greater decrease in arm circumference was observed in 11 patients (33%) and 18 had a reduction of at least 20%, a reduction reported to be across the whole range of severity of lymphedema. One notes that 31 subjects (94%) used other standard therapies during the study, although 30 reported no change in their standard regimen. Now here\u2019s where how you present the data makes all the difference in the word. These percentages seem huge, but you have to remember that the way they were calculated was in terms of the difference between the two arms in circumference, normalized to the pre-treatment difference. If the pre-treatment difference is small, then it doesn\u2019t take much of a decrease in lymphedema to produce a large percentage. That\u2019s why the really telling figure comes from Table 3, which shows that the mean difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment arm circumference was 0.9 cm (95% confidence interval 0.72 to 1.07 cm). That is spectacularly unimpressive, particularly in a population that skews obese. It sure sounds a hell of a lot more impressive. Of course, the biggest problem with this pilot study is that it was uncontrolled. There is no control group. So we have no idea whether acupuncture had anything to do with the modest decrease in lymphedema reported. I will give Dr. Cassileth credit in that she does acknowledge this in the paper: Whether acupuncture alone was responsible for this reduction was not evaluable in this pilot study. Our focus was on safety and potential efficacy, as current clinical practice to protect the lymphedematous arm prohibits needling. Yet she also concludes, unfortunately: The therapeutic and cost-reduction potential of acupuncture for lymphedema may yield an important tool in the arsenal of lymphedema management. Although randomized clinical trial results await, including our ongoing study, acupuncture can be considered to treat this distressing problem confronted by many women with no other options for sustained reduction in arm circumference. And in a press release, she says: \u201cWe have shown that acupuncture as a treatment for lymphedema is safe and well tolerated,\u201d says Dr. Cassileth. \u201cFurthermore, this study demonstrated reductions in lymphedema for the patients treated, providing strong impetus for the randomized controlled trial that is now under way to prove that the effect is real.\u201d Actually, no it doesn\u2019t. This study is not good evidence that acupuncture works for lymphedema. There is no reason from a standpoint of prior plausibility informed by biology to think that acupuncture would do anything for lymphedema. On a Bayesian basis, exceedingly low prior probability plus an equivocal result (and, yes, this result is equivocal) equals a very high likelihood that the effect observed is a false positive. Even worse, the randomized clinical trial being carried out isn\u2019t one that is likely to provide much of an answer. It\u2019s a phase 2 clinical trial comparing immediate acupuncture to wait list for six weeks, after which wait listed subjects will cross over and receive acupuncture for six weeks. In other words, everyone in the study will receive acupuncture. I mean, really. Why are they even bothering? This study is unlikely to provide strong evidence that acupuncture works. Most likely, it will be another equivocal acupuncture trial. Of course, the ironic thing is that the crossover design was probably necessitated by the seemingly \u201cpositive\u201d result of Cassileth\u2019s currently reported trial. The IRB probably wouldn\u2019t approve a no acupuncture arm in light of that, because then there wouldn\u2019t be clinical equipoise. Oh, the ironies of quackademic medicine, when the inevitable false positives that occur when treatments of low prior probability are tested in clinical trials complicate the next steps! It\u2019s just infuriating how much time and resources are being wasted on studies that are so highly unlikely ever to produce useful results.   Knowledge is the antidote to fear, Ralph Waldo Emerson Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Unfortunately, there are some nasty \"politics\" involved: the APTA has the firm stance that all/any PT can treat LE, yet studies show that they receive little training even if they have advanced degrees. I've spoken to PT's who tell me that their CLT training and LANA are not on their formal national certificates, as the APTA doesn't recognize them. I took a full CLT course by Klose last summer, and there were PT's, OT's, OTA's and LMT's in the class and working on each other, it was obvious that skill and expertise varied. I tended to work with a PT who had been \"volunteered\" by her hospital, and didn't want to learn LE, but she was a true professional and took the course very seriously and did a super job. Another woman, an OT, just clearly never \"got it\". And, whenever possible, I tried to snag an LMT...The woman who brought Klose to our state is a very experienced LE PT, but she'd only done weekend courses before. I got to work with her once, and she's great. STAR is nonsense, IMO. It's on-line and inaccurate. I know PT's who've done pelvic floor rehab training--and the APTA recognizes that, but I sure wish they'd change their stance and admit that further training is needed for PT's to treat LE. (Nicole Stout, a serious researcher in LE is on the board of the APTA, hopefully she's making the case from within....) Off the soap box Gin, you had a large cord and I'm glad you found a good therapist. I just with that politics, turf battles and a certain rehab MD who sells a course of dubious value, and touts her two books in expensive Harvard Medical School classes on \"how to get published\" would quit their behavior because it interferes with our ability to get good care. On SUSO we have access to videos that demonstrate a method of manipulating cords, developed by Elisabeth Josenhans of Germany, and we limit access to trained therapists, as we don't want people to inadvertantly injure themselves, and I get requests from all over the globe.",

      "Content": "Feb 13, 2009 09:07AM - edited Feb 13, 2009 09:24AM by kira Laura, there are a lot of studies--one just released in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, that look at symptoms, rather than measurements. No one agrees what constitutes LE: is it 2 cm of arm size difference? bioimpediance (which a researcher at NYU found very insensitive), perometry (good for limbs, not so good for hands), or some combination of physical measurements along with a survey that asks about history of swelling and symptoms. The researcher at NYU--Mei Fu--has a great multipage survey that she combines with physical measurements, bioimpediance, and perometry.(In my opinion, that's the standard: survey PLUS measurements.)   This recent study in JCO concluded that the incidence of LE over 5 years: was 42%, and they used a survey. Most LE was mild, and few women sought/received treatment for the mild cases, and only 68% got treatment for the more severe cases. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19064976?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum Lymphedema in breast cancer survivors: incidence, degree, time course, treatment, and symptoms. Norman SA, Localio AR, Potashnik SL, Simoes Torpey HA, Kallan MJ, Weber AL, Miller LT, Demichele A, Solin LJ. Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Center for Clinical Epidemiologyand Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6021, USA. snorman@mail.med.upenn.edu PURPOSE: To examine the incidence, degree, time course, treatment, and symptoms of lymphedema in breast cancer survivors. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year, population-based prospective study of 631 randomly selected Philadelphia and Delaware County, Pennsylvania female residents with incident breast cancer who were diagnosed from 1999 to 2001. Using a questionnaire previously validated against physical therapists' measurement-based clinical criteria, we assigned a score indicating the degree of lymphedema (none, mild, or moderate/severe) to each month of follow-up based on the respondent's perceived differences in hand/arm size. Standard survival analysis methods permitted maximum use of follow-up. RESULTS: Five-year cumulative incidence of lymphedema was 42 (42%) per 100 women. Among the 238 affected women, lymphedema first occurred within 2 years of diagnosis in 80% and within 3 years in 89%. Among 433 women observed for 3 years, 23% reported no more than mild lymphedema, 12% reported moderate/severe lymphedema, and 2% reported chronically moderate/severe lymphedema. Women with mild lymphedema were more than three times more likely to develop moderate/severe lymphedema than women with no lymphedema. Thirty-seven percent of women with mild lymphedema and 68% with moderate/severe lymphedema received treatment. Increasing proportions of women with increasing degree of lymphedema reported symptoms (eg, jewelry too tight, tired/thick/heavy arm). Symptoms present before the first occurrence of lymphedema were associated with a higher probability of later lymphedema (eg, hazard ratio for jewelry too tight = 7.37; 95% CI, 4.26 to 12.76). CONCLUSION: Lymphedema after breast cancer is common but mostly mild. Subtle differences in self-reported hand/arm size and symptoms can be early signs of progressing lymphedema.    So, no agreement about what defines LE, but an increasing understanding that pain, heaviness, tightness, are all significant. The classic definition talks about noticeable swelling and pitting of the skin when pressed.   Journey: it makes me so mad that LE is pushed off the PT/OT's to treat and they don't normally treat chronic diseases, so you get the classic insurance benefit of limited visits. If you were seeing a doctor for it, there would be no limit, but there are few doctors who treat LE, and most refer you to a therapist. Deb, TWO hours a day! You are dedicated. Binney has said that Steve Norton, of the Norton school, isn't into self MLD and wants patients to limit their self care to 15 minutes a day, so they don't burn out. Personally, I do MLD/exercises twice a day--maybe a half hour a day? I'm so glad you found a good therapist--and amazed you drove 300 miles. (I drive about 50 miles to see mine at this point...)  Journey: there is no one plan that fits everyone. That's why a GOOD therapist is essential to help create the plan that works for you. While you are working toward that goal, some resources that can help: a book Lymphedema, by Burt and White, the Northwest LE self care videos by JoAnn Rovig.  About your sleeve/gauntlet--I started out not wearing anything, and now I wear a glove as needed and wrap every night. I have a jovipak, but my PT told me to \"put it in my sock drawer\". Things change, and our therapeutic plan has to adjust to our changes.  www.nwlymphedemacenter.org/  And JoAnn created a self care video, years ago, it's called Upper extremity care, or post-mastectomy, but it reviews MLD, bandaging. She sells it as does the NLN www.jovipak.com/video.shtml The DVD is $50, as Binney says, LE is an expensive problem. And, Cheryl and everyone else, LE stinks. You have to manage it on your own, the people who make the problem--our medical team--don't stick around to help with it, and it's a daily reminder that is just so frustrating. There was a woman who posted a while back about having no help, and getting a compression sleeve and gauntlet and wearing it day and night (controversial) for about a year and finally getting control over her LE. We can manage it, we don't have to like it. Kira ",

Maybe you could ask her where she was trained--because, unfortunately, there is no board certification in lymphedema. There are a lot of politics involved, and PT/OT's believe that their basic training makes LANA or additional certification unnecessary. Yet, few PT's receive more than a few hours of LE training in school. I was wondering if MSOT= masters in OT? I tried to google it and couldn't come up with an answer. Hopefully Binney will weigh in.

      "Content": "Apr 10, 2013 09:28AM - edited Apr 10, 2013 09:30AM by kira Tammy, I would not accept pain at the end of the day as your new normal. My LE is predominantly in my hand and forearm of my dominant hand as well, and hands are tough--there is a great article on the lymphadivas site, written by Andrea Cheville, about why you need to protect the hand as it hard for the body to drain, and gloves are an art form. I wear custom Juzo gloves with an extended wrist--and I'm currently waiting for the second attempt on the most recent one. I don't wear a sleeve usually. Here's the link to the Andrea Cheville article: http://www.lymphedivas.com/comprehensivecompression.asp For me, I find that wrapping my arm at night allows me to wake up with a hand that is in great shape, and keep my arm measurements stable, and that allows me to avoid much compression during the day--as I wash my hands at work all the time. The tools for self management are: self MLD,well fitting day time compression--used as it is needed, night time compression if needed--and it sounds like if fluid is building up during the day, you could very well benefit. Night time compression is either night garments, or wrapping. Therapeutic exercise--exercises like Lebed that help lymph drainage, and general exercise is good for you. There are more tools, but this is the basic tool box for self management. And, the management is 99% done by us. Here's a link to therapy and garments on stepupspeak out: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/treatments_for_lymphedema.htm http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema_garments.htm So, in summary, I would re-evaluate how you treat your LE--do you need night time compression? Is your sleeve pushing fluid into your hand? How well does your glove fit? What other tools do you need for optimal self management? And as far as yoga goes, the documents created by Carol are amazing, and the general rule of thumb is to avoid overloading the arms, with downward dog, plank and other movements--a good yoga teacher will help you modify them. And so many of the women here do yoga. The goal is not to give up what you love, but to modify it so it continues to nourish your life, without causing pain or a flare. Steep learning cure on LE, and grief as well. Keep asking questions Kira",

One of my most cited articles by AW Stanton is that lymphedema can and will present with just subtle changes--no pitting edema or measurement changes. There's a good quote on bc.org, from Andrea Cheville: According to Andrea Cheville, MD, associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mayo Clinic, it\u2019s important to look at the whole picture: not just size and volume measurements, but the appearance of the limb or other body part. \u201cThere is no one value or standard you can use to say, \u2018OK, if you meet that you have lymphedema, and if you don\u2019t, well then you don\u2019t have it,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Cheville. \u201cFor example, there may be no size or volume changes in the arm, but you could have subtle hand swelling or pitting on the arm. So it\u2019s important not to be too locked into arm measurements alone, as that can create a false sense of security. You also need to be watching the arm and looking for the loss of what we call \u2018anatomic architecture\u2019 \u2014 an inability to see the veins and tendons in the arm as clearly, or less pronounced knuckles, or skin that is less wrinkled and therefore looks younger.\u201d http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/lymphedema/evaluation/diagnosis",

I think a negative PET should really reassure you that this is likely LE, and not a recurrence. Don't worry about the BS blowing you off--many surgeons do, because \"None of MY patients get LE\" is a common refrain. You'll need a referral from a physician, and it sounds like your onc is the best bet. I don't know why physicians, especially surgeons need to deny our reality, but often, due to a complex mixture of lack of information (no education provided in med school or residency or afterwards) and a desire to deny complications that they feel responsible for, it happens--all too often.

When you get a referral, make sure the therapist is well trained, and LANA certification is a very good sign. My LE therapist is LANA certified, and I've met a couple who are who aren't up to her standard of care, unfortunately. Good to know the credentials of anyone who treats you, though. Kira",

Women will also be under the care of their family doctor, and it is from this doctor they might seek advice regarding their lymphoedema. Because most women will have minimal overt signs of swelling at this stage, the symptoms they experience, including shoulder stiffness and ache, might be dismissed. Yet it is currently believed, although not proved, that intervention at the earliest opportunity is the most effective. To address the needs of women with lymphoedema and perhaps prevent progression, it is important that mild symptoms are not dismissed and that women are referred to the appropriate specialist. ",

In any medical condition, history is just as important as physical exam--why do we make LE a disease that can only be confirmed by exam, when there are no clear diagnostic criteria and swelling, by definition in stage 0 and 1, will come and go, and if you treat it, it will reduce. So, when the 2 cm swelling is reduced, do you no longer have LE? If your trunk wasn't swollen because you wore compression, yet have experienced it, isn't it real? Kira ",

LE is not defined by volume increases: there is no actual definition, and much of the problem is inflammation, and just decreasing volume doesn't mean you're cured or you don't have LE. It's right here on bc.org, from Andrea Cheville: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/lymphedema/evaluation/diagnosis According to Andrea Cheville, MD, associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mayo Clinic, it\u2019s important to look at the whole picture: not just size and volume measurements, but the appearance of the limb or other body part. \u201cThere is no one value or standard you can use to say, \u2018OK, if you meet that you have lymphedema, and if you don\u2019t, well then you don\u2019t have it,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Cheville. \u201cFor example, there may be no size or volume changes in the arm, but you could have subtle hand swelling or pitting on the arm. So it\u2019s important not to be too locked into arm measurements alone, as that can create a false sense of security. You also need to be watching the arm and looking for the loss of what we call \u2018anatomic architecture\u2019 \u2014 an inability to see the veins and tendons in the arm as clearly, or less pronounced knuckles, or skin that is less wrinkled and therefore looks younger.\u201d  My arm is small because I treat it. I took a full CLT course, and while I learned a lot, it also made me realize how therapists can be trained and still have a large knowledge defecit: it's 135 hours, but 40 are web based lectures and then you do 10 long days. I was the student from hell--the teacher would say \"Lymphatic transport capacity is fixed\" and I'd say, \"Actually....there are multiple studies to show that the lymphatic pump fatigues\". I did the \"Actually\" thing a lot. I thought my fellow students would hate me, but they actually told me that they felt they learned a lot. I had my trusty iPad and would interupt her constantly. No one can become expert after 10 days. It's just not possible. In the past, LANA wouldn't allow a therapist/CLT to take the course until they'd worked in the field for a year, but recently, they dropped that requirement--because so few people are taking the test. So, you meet a lot of LE therapists who learned a bit, and don't know what they don't know. And they can get dogmatic. I have had shoulder issues since getting LE (and mine is mostly in my left hand/forearm): 1) I got a classic frozen shoulder on my LE arm after 6 weeks in my thumb spica cast--which had to be bivalved to relieve swelling--I had a miserable day after the second cast, went back once and the cast tech was clueless, and went back a second time and got a great cast tech who cut channels into it to accomodate swelling. And now, when I was home recovering from my tamoxifen related hyst, I reached behind me and tore something in my right shoulder: I'm currently in PT with a PT who is also LE trained (my personal LE therapist is an LMT) and she thinks I tore my pec, and it's slow going. It's rough, because I don't have a \"good\" arm currently. And I'm sure the lack of estrogen after the hyst isn't helping. Back to you: classic LE symptoms include joint dysfunction. You know your body. The LE therapist doesn't know what she doesn't know. Breast LE is very, very common and will tend to improve over time, but her discounting yours is a classic case of denying your reality. I agree that your prior trauma set you up. Listen to your body and do what works, and if you can, gently educate the LE therapist.",

I would imagine that for some people, they're very useful.   The actual protocol that was used for the women with lymphedema was posted on the NLN site: www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... And click on the PALs protocol, it will open as a pdf. You can use it for a guideline. Dr. Schmidtz only let women who had stable lymphedema do the exercises--defined as no need for therapy in the last 3 months. I think everyone's exercise tolerance is different, and it will vary depending on how stable your lymphedema is at the time. I do think that PT's want to strengthen us, and I think that we need to be aware that some of us need to start very, very slowly.  I heard this lecture from a PT from McGill about aqua lymphatic therapy, and she was very careful in what she had the women do: a lot of water walking and dog paddling. Other women have posted that they do a lot of kick boarding and see what their arms will tolerate. The PT talked about how compression varies by water depth, and she did like the \"arrow\"--where you push off from the wall, with your arms out-stretched. The Lebed DVD is available on-line: http://www.lebedmethod.com/ I was searching on youtube, and found a 2008 video from Dana Farber on how they do Lebed, and the woman used therabands! The real Lebed is nothing like what was on their video. Sherry Lebed has a bunch of videos on youtube This one is on frozen shoulder, in her DVD, she wears a sleeve and glove, as she has LE in her left arm--not here. www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_w7f... Here are a couple of her initial breathing and stretching exercises www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2luK4... Second session www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6f7N8... There's a bunch more on youtube. Very interesting that on her DVD, which is sponsored by Juzo, she's wearing her garments, but on youtube, she's not. Here is her take on therabands: she moves slowly, with minimal resistance, and says she'll mail out a theraband to anyone who contacts her www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0IpF4... I did write her, and ask why no compression garments on youtube, I found this on her chat part of her site: Sherry wrote on Aug 19 09 at 8:08 AM We have all read by now the wonderful new study on Weight Lifting and Lymphedema and if not, look at my blog \u2018bug bites and Lymphedema\" However still be careful. I have Lymphedema in my left arm and hand and tried weight lifting with an exercise specialist who is a Lymphedema expert. (which is what you should do if you decide to weight lift) We started with small amounts of weights at low reps, which was good. As we increased the weights and reps my arm was not happy about that and began to swell. We eventually had to back off and go to the lower weights and less reps. So just know that everyone is different and to make sure you are with someone who knows what they are doing.  Kira",

Also, they'll put chevron channels in a glove if you ask. I learned my lesson. Never order without a fitter. They did me a special favor, and I was brand new to LE, so it's got to be almost 5 years ago, and let me open a professional account for just the one order. I didn't go through insurance. The next Tribute I got was with a fitter, through insurance, and it was the one piece, and never did do a great job on my hand/fingers. I do know I've heard from them that they're trying to address the hand issues. Please let them know, the new approach isn't working. I wish I could tell you I used the two piece, but I didn't.

Epub 2010 May 25. Tissue expander breast reconstruction is not associated with an increased risk of lymphedema. Avraham T, Daluvoy SV, Riedel ER, Cordeiro PG, Van Zee KJ, Mehrara BJ. Source Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. Abstract BACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated that lymphedema can occur after even minor pertubation of the axillary region such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The impact of breast reconstruction on the development of lymphedema, however, remains unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the impact of immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction on the risk of developing lymphedema. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified patients who had undergone mastectomy with SLNB or SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with or without breast reconstruction using our prospectively maintained lymphedema and breast reconstruction databases. The development of lymphedema was evaluated prospectively using arm measurements and a validated questionnaire. Associations between variables were examined. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of reconstruction on prevalence of lymphedema while adjusting individually for BMI, age, and weight gain after surgery. RESULTS: Characteristics of patients with or without reconstruction were similar except for age, BMI, and weight gain since surgery. Median follow-up was 5 years. Among patients treated with mastectomy with SLNB or SLNB/ALND, those undergoing reconstruction had a lower rate of measured lymphedema than those who did not (5% vs. 18%, P < .0004). The reconstructed group also had fewer patients with both measured and self-reported lymphedema (3% vs. 12%, P < .002). Differences in the rates of measured lymphedema between groups persisted following univariate logistical regression for differences in age, BMI, and weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue expander breast reconstruction in patients undergoing SLNB or SLNB/ALND does not increase the risk of developing measured or perceived lymphedema.

I'm leaning toward wrapping at home--and I will bring a prescription, the NLN guidelines, and I think I have some of those Jobst booklets--do have lots of Juzo ones. It's just so much easier to wrap at home than on a seat at the gate area. My co-worker's husband is currently working for TSA in RI and I'll ask her to ask him. Erica, from what my coworker has told me about TSA, there are a lot of disgruntled employees. It sounds horrible. Binney had pm'ed me that it's deciding which bothers me more: having to wrap at the gate or dealing with security. Right now, it's wrapping at the gate. We'll see.... I hate LE.... Kira No one answered Diamond Girl: my fitter doesn't like those new Jobst sleeves--she finds them short. I'd be more concerned about an overly tight wrist that didn't let the hand drain, and if you already have swelling, you should be wearing compression for the flight--hand compression too, can you get ahold of a gauntlet on short notice? Is this your first sleeve? Two links: the NLN position paper on flying and the Lymphadivas on why hand compression is important www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gau...

Here are the facts of which I am confident:   1. the effect of respiration (deep or otherwise) on central venous pressure, and, therefore, venous flow, is cyclical, by its very nature: during inspiration, intrathoracic pressure drops significantly, creating a suction effect to pull fluid into the right heart and pulmonary vasculature. R heart pressures, transiently go up, but central venous pressure falls as the blood enters the right heart. Everything happens in reverse during expiration.   2. Because these events are cyclical, the net effect upon edema would be neutral; however, the effect of deep respiration on interstitial mobilization of fluid is beneficial, because of the known stimulatory effect of the respiratory mechanics upon central lymph flow. It is for this reason that respiratory exercises comprise a part of most physiotherapeutic approaches to lymphedema management, and the beneficial effects have been documented. Here is the page from the UK that just advises neck/chest/back MLD www.macmillan.org.uk/Cancerinf...  Maybe just try the abbreviated MLD and deep breathing, and see how you are after a few days?

I saw a PT who was trained in a weekend course, and her concept of MLD was to grab eucerin cream and knead me like bread dough.  My LE therapist is both Klose and Vodder trained and has >20 years experience and her touch is so light.  When I took the CLT course, some of the moves are hard to figure out---there are stationary circles (easy for me--on someone else), but those rotatory moves were soooo hard. I paired up with a great PT, who kept correcting me as I worked on her. And again, we only trained on site for 9 days--we came to the course after completing the on-line portion, to make up the full 135 hours.  I was not ready for prime time after the training.  I have given lectures at the Vodder re-certification, and it's the only LE school that asks their trainees to come back every other year and demonstrate that they're doing MLD correctly. They are taught by an 80 year old woman from Germany, and my LE therapist says she's often in tears, after Hildegaard is through with her... And, I was the CLT student from hell. The teacher would say something like \"lymphatic transport capacity is fixed\" and I would say, pulling out my iPad, \"actually the latest studies show that the pump is variable and fatigues with time and is abnormal in the \"normal\" limbs of a person with LE\". The teacher would grit her teeth. But the other students told me they appreciated it.  The teacher mentioned stepupspeakout.org as a reference, and when I told her I helped create it, she muttered \"So that's YOUR site\" and gritted her teeth some more. And she is a good teacher, from a good school, but she just kind of simplified the information. I was lost in the wilderness when I first got LE--3 weeks post op--and Binney helped me out.  Coffee, your arm likely was a set up. LE is an inflammatory condition and your prior surgeries set the stage for inflammation.",

But these were women with proven low grade, latency LE. There is no study to prove that putting compression on a limb that is not symptomatic will prevent LE, and poorly fitting compression can trap fluid. Some researchers--one in particular--are actually against compression.  I'll ask Binney to weigh in, but personally, I think you should just exercise precaution in the arm and be sensitive to changes in it. I really don't know about wearing a sleeve on that arm when you fly--it would be very debatable. Kira",

I know that seems like \"overkill\" if I don't need daytime compression, but it's what keeps me from needing it. I spoke to a surgeon who uses bioimpedance regularly in his practice to measure fluid in patients' arms and breasts, and he also uses it to check how quickly their arms reaccumulate fluid without day and/or night compression. Wrapping reduces volume, compression garments maintain volume reduction. That said, some women only need daytime compression, and their need for it varies. I found I needed it a lot at the beginning, and after starting a job that required a lot of use of my hand and arm, and after my hand fracture. Kira ",

The one huge  issue with nurses getting training in LE therapy is that nurses can not be reimbursed for providing it. Thank you medicare guidelines. The PT's \"own\" LE treatment, and even in the proposed Lymphedema treatment act, which is essentially dead, it was never addressed. And there are all sorts of fights within the PT establishment about whether the 135 hours of training are really needed--even though LE treatment isn't covered in most PT programs, PT's argue that they can provide it without additional training.  The LMT's can't get reimbursed either--some facilities will have an LMT work with a PT, but most are flat out of luck with insurance reimbursement. And, MD's are not allowed to supervise PT's and LMT's which is why the Foldi clinic model died in NYC and other places. Done with the rant about how reimbursement patterns influence and inhibit getting the best care for LE: Here's a link an article on Jane Armer's presentation: http://www.onclive.com/conference-coverage/ons-2011/What-Nurses-May-Not-Know-About-Lymphedema What Nurses May Not Know About Lymphedema ALFP Director Jane M. Armer, RN, PhD Lymphedema is the treatment-induced buildup of extra lymph fluid in tissues that causes discomforting and potentially debilitating swelling of the limbs. In an abstract presented at the 36th Annual Oncology Nursing Society Congress in Boston, Massachusetts, researchers from the American Lymphedema Framework Project (ALFP) presented their analysis, \"What Oncology Nurses May Not Know About Cancer-Related Lymphedema.\" Lymphedema is most frequently associated with breast cancer, which ALFP Director Jane M. Armer, RN, PhD, School of Nursing, University of Missouri, Columbia, suggested may simply be due to the disproportionate amount of breast cancer data available. Non-breast cancers associated with lymphedema include genitourinary and head and neck cancers, as well as melanoma. The ALFP research sought to establish a baseline of knowledge about lymphedema treatment to address a general lack of awareness about managing the condition. Lymphedema is primarily treated by trained therapists, so the ALFP decided to conduct a survey of these experts. The survey was completed by 419 lymphedema therapists from 46 states. Physical therapists comprised the largest number of respondents and nurses made up the smallest number. The survey found that the majority of lymphedema patients are being treated in hospital outpatient clinics. A breakdown of anatomical treatment sites included the upper extremities (59%), lower extremities (30%), trunk (16%), head and neck (6%), and genitals (4%). The survey revealed that comprehensive decongestive therapy (CDT) is the gold standard of primary treatment for lymphedema. Used by 97% of therapists, CDT involves, \"Manual lymphatic drainage, compression bandaging, compression garments, self-care teaching about risk reduction and skin care, and a program of exercise,\" said Armer. Sixty-eight percent of therapists also reported using soft tissue mobilization, which Armer said is an \"advanced technique.\" Armer said the ALFP survey revealed an opportunity for oncology nurses to specialize in lymphedema therapy. She stressed 2 important roles for oncology nurses. The first is patient education on risk reduction and self-care. The other is taking the advanced training and becoming a nurse lymphedema therapist. The recommended training for lymphedema therapists includes 135 hours of classroom and online training. Regarding the future plans for the ALFP, Armer said they intend to repeat the survey to see what has changed in the field since the initial survey was conducted 2 years ago. This time, the ALFP hopes to survey lymphedema therapists who have \"an even broader training background than those that we reached in the first survey,\" Armer said.

There's a big push in the LE research community to identify \"high risk\" women--well, some of us have genetic predispositions, and some of us have higher risk due to our treatment and I always think that we go through periods of higher risk: during rads--and sadly, after rads as the tissue gets fibrotic, during chemo, post-op. I totally identify with the desire to get the normal back, I'd just say, be aware of the risk posed by air flight and the fact that you have some hand swelling, and approach the trip well informed about the risk of air flight triggering LE, and get checked out and informed to make sure you don't have swelling already. Those of us with LE have had to give up somethings--like I don't play tennis anymore, but we also work with the triggers and thanks to Carol and Nordy and NatsFan and others--we live active lives and exercise.

While the benefits of manual lymphatic drainage are well recognized for cases of longstanding lymphedema, does it provide enough benefit for early cases to warrant the added cost to patients? New research sheds new light on the debate. Early studies of lymphedema showed that when manual lymphatic drainage massage (MLD) was included as part of Complex (Combined) Decongestive Therapy (CDT) it resulted in a substantial additional decrease in swelling (ref 1). However, a more recent meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (a robust experimental methodology), suggests that the benefits MLD may be much more modest, albeit still statistically significant (ref 2). While MLD is a safe practice without known side effects, it is important to consider how much additional benefit is derived from incorporating MLD into treatment, and compare this to the added cost. The studies to date have not been sufficiently large enough, nor designed effectively enough, to draw strong conclusions. A new Canadian study published last week sheds further light on this issue. The randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the benefit of manual lymphatic drainage as part of CDT for the treatment of lymphedema secondary to breast cancer (ref 3). This study improves on previous randomized controlled trials by evaluating a greater number of patients (103 enrolled, 95 completed), across multiple health centers (six). The study compared CDT (comprised of manual lymphatic drainage, compression, education, exercise and skin care) with and without the MLD component, evaluating arm volume, function and quality of life immediately following treatment, as well as at 12, 24 and 52 weeks post-treatment. The authors concluded that, in contrast with previous studies, they were \u201cunable to demonstrate a significant improvement in lymphedema with decongestive therapy [CDT with MLD] compared with a more conservative approach [CDT without MLD]\u201d. This study was published alongside an opinion piece by unrelated authors that was curiously titled: \u201cMounting Evidence Against Complex Decongestive Therapy As a First-Line Treatment for Early Lymphedema\u201d, and that cites these results and some of the other earlier randomized controlled trials as evidence that MLD (and not CDT as the title suggested) may not be a cost-effective strategy of first-line care for patients with early lymphedema compared with \u201cconservative\u201d practices (namely CDT without MLD). The latest study had enough patients enrolled to be able to detect a 20% or greater difference in percent arm volume reduction between the test groups with statistical confidence. Their data showed a 6% improvement in arm volume levels in favour of MLD, but accordingly this was deemed to be statistically insignificant. The authors state that a larger study size may show that the 6% difference is in fact statistically valid. However, when the authors examined absolute volume reduction rather than volume reduction as a percentage of initial baseline volume, the benefit of adding MLD was found to be both larger and statistically significant (250ml vs 143ml of volume reduction). The reliability of this result was questioned by the authors since, by chance, the women in the MLD group had on average a larger excess baseline volume (750ml vs 624ml) than those in the control group, and so they had the potential to lose more. Although this may be a rational argument, it may also be overly simplistic: a previous study showed that patients with more mild swelling actually respond better to treatment than those with more moderate swelling (see our blog post), and hence it is possible that the small benefit of manual lymphatic drainage observed in the current study may actually be greater than what was reported. Unfortunately, when the authors attempted to use two different statistical methods to remove the excess baseline arm volume difference from the analysis they got conflicting results as to whether the resulting absolute difference was in fact still statistically significant. The authors further point out that the best measure of treatment outcomes (percentage volume or absolute volume) has not been established. Assuming the benefit of MLD is statistically valid, it is unclear whether such differences impact patient function and/or quality of life. Participants did not report significant differences in symptoms or quality of life between the two groups over the time frame investigated. Interestingly, the authors did note that patients with lymphedema for more than one year tended to see greater benefit from CDT, although once again the study did not have sufficient statistical power to assess this trend. As the authors note, this observation supports the notion that longstanding lymphedema, in particular where fibrotic tissue has formed, may be less amenable to compression alone and may require the use of massage to help breakdown scar tissue (ref 4). CDT with or without MLD provides a large and valuable benefit to patients with lymphedema. The incremental benefit of including manual lymphatic drainage is likely greater for patients with more longstanding, or advanced, cases of lymphedema, or for those who do not respond well to compression alone. Manual lymphatic drainage is demonstrated to be a safe technique without known side effects. The major concern with incorporating MLD into the treatment of patients with early cases of lymphedema (where the relative response may be the smallest), is the cost-benefit. Namely, is the added monetary cost of providing manual lymphatic drainage worth the potentially small improvement in limb volume in these patients? As the authors point out, the cost of incorporating MLD in their study was considerable ($1500 CDN), or $13/ml of additional volume reduction. The high cost of treatment was a result of the intensive treatment protocol used: MLD was provided in five one-hour sessions per week, for a total of four weeks. It is not clear why the authors chose this course of treatment. The effective amount of MLD to achieve limb reduction has not been adequately investigated, but a number of studies have shown significant reductions with much less intensive regimens (such as in ref 5 where an average reduction of over 50% was observed in 12 treatments), with the majority of volume reduction occurring within the first two weeks of treatment initiation. While a hard-nosed dissection of treatment cost is refreshing to see, in this case it is not particularly informative. The protocol used in this study would be considered by many practitioners including ourselves to be overkill for the vast majority of patients, and especially for those with early lymphedema. When evaluating the cost-benefit of MLD it is also important to consider the broader clinical context. While modest additional reductions in arm volume afforded by the addition of MLD to CDT for patients with early lymphedema may not have a significant impact on patient quality of life in the short term, it is worthwhile considering the progressive nature of this condition. Swelling causes cumulative damage to the lymphatic system and surrounding tissue, which exacerbates the underlying insufficiency. Having larger volumes of swelling for longer duration will cause proportionally greater damage, a downward spiral that leads to an advanced stage of lymphedema called \u201cnon-pitting lymphedema\u201d where the swelling becomes firm and fibrotic. This advanced stage coincides with changes in tissue composition including a substantial increase in fat which can make CDT less effective, potentially necessitating more invasive procedures (see our blog post). When taking the available research into consideration, our (admittedly biased) opinion is that the current gold standard of care (CDT with MLD) remains a prudent strategy for cases of early lymphedema, and that the detection and treatment of early lymphedema is vital. Given the current context of health care funding in Canada, where patients pay out of pocket for lymphedema treatment, patients need to be well informed of their treatment options so that they can make the most effective use of their health care dollars. Patients should seek out CDT practitioners who are able explain the benefits of each treatment, and who will work with them to maximally attain their health goals within their budgets. In most cases much less intensive courses of MLD can be effective, and can be incorporated into sessions that provide additional therapy. In addition, patients should act proactively to decrease their risk of lymphedema in the first place (learn self-monitoring and preventative practices), and seek out CDT early on to prevent or delay progression. In one study it was reported that early intervention in mild cases could contain lymphedema at low levels for at least 10 years (ref 6). Finally, learning self-massage techniques (watch our lymphedema self-massage video) can allow patients incorporate some MLD into their daily lives at no added cost. ",

The potential contribution of genetic susceptibility to risk of developing secondary lymphedema following surgical trauma, radiation, and other tissue insults has not been studied. Experimental Design:To determine if women with breast cancer and secondary lymphedema had mutations in candidate lymphedema genes, we undertook a case - control study of 188 women diagnosed with breast cancer recruited from the University of Pittsburgh Breast Cancer Program (www.upmccancercenter.com/breas... between 2000-2010. Candidate lymphedema genes, GJC2 (encoding connexin 47 [Cx47]), FOXC2, HGF, MET, and FLT4 (encoding VEGFR3), were sequenced for mutation. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro functional assays were used to confirm significance of novel mutations. Results:Cx47 mutations were identified in individuals having secondary lymphedema following breast cancer treatment but not in breast cancer controls or normal women without breast cancer. These novel mutations are dysfunctional as assessed through in vitro assays and bioinformatics analysis, and provide evidence that altered gap junction function leads to lymphedema. Conclusions:Our findings challenge the view that secondary lymphedema is solely due to mechanical trauma and support the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility is an important risk factor for secondary lymphedema. A priori recognition of genetic risk 1) raises the potential for early detection and intervention for a high risk group, and 2) allows the possibility of altering surgical approach and/or chemo- and radiation therapy, or direct medical treatment of secondary lymphedema with novel connexin modifying drugs.

So, they seem to offer a unilateral sleeve in a compression class 2, and a bilateral in a compression class1--but don't consider compression class one therapeutic, yet it's the most commonly used compression class. It would be nice if they offered both versions in both compression classes.  They sent me fabric samples, and a brochure. Nordy--MOTC uses a 15-20 mm Jobst sleeve with a higher compression glove and that combo works well for her. Less is quite often more. Kira http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm#Millimeters_of_mercury_and_compression_class \"Millimeters of mercury\" and \"compression class\" Unfortunately, size is not the only consideration in fitting a lymphedema garment. The amount of compression your garment applies will vary according to your specific needs and the stage of your lymphedema. This compression level is measured in units called \"millimeters of mercury.\" It's written in scientific shorthand like this: mm/Hg. (The \"mm\" stands for millimeters, and the \"Hg\" is the chemical symbol for mercury.) Compression garments are ordered by \"compression class,\" or the range of compression you need, stated in millimeters of mercury. Here's a run-down of compression classes recognized in the United States, along with their usual uses (which may vary with individual circumstances): * Class 0: 15-20 mm/Hg - used for those at risk for lymphedema * Class I: 20-30 mm/Hg - used for those at risk, or for early or mild lymphedema * Class II: 30-40 mm/Hg - used for moderate or severe lymphedema * Class III: 40-50 mm/Hg - used for severe or hard-to-control lymphedema To add to the confusion, European compression classes differ slightly from their US counterparts, like so: * Class I: 18-21 mm/Hg * Class II: 23-32 mm/Hg * Class III: 34-46 mm/Hg",

So, do not be upset if you swell initially, you've had a lot of trauma. Just be gentle to yourself, don't lift your arms above shoulder height for the next 10 days or so and you can do these gentle exercises on the ACS page: These tips and exercises listed below should be done for the first 3 to 7 (I'd strongly say 10-14 days) days after surgery.

Email to a friend Print Page last modified on: August 25, 2008 Question fromAmy: Does lymphedema only occur in the arm or can it be in the breast as well? Answers -Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : Absolutely! Not only can it be in the breast as well, it can be exclusively in the breast and chest wall, even if it does not appear in the arm. So we need to recognize that breast edema and chest wall edema exist and should be treated. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S.: As a surgeon, I probably see it more acutely than most and have a more difficult time getting other physicians to acknowledge that there is such an entity as lymphedema of the breast which is actually quite uncomfortable for some patients as well as alarming, because it is difficult to ask for treatment for swollen breasts. I think maybe you can comment on how you manage patients like this. Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would say, first of all, recognition is part of the key. I believe anecdotally that I am seeing more frequency of breast and chest wall swelling - lymphedema, if you will - now with the sentinel node biopsy, as we are removing the direct drainage pathway out of the breast. Unfortunately, it is going far underrecognized. Treatment for breast and chest wall lymphedema is analogous to the way we would treat the arm, meaning that the patients would require lymphatic drainage, compression, therapy, exercise, and skin care. Many of these patients will require custom fit or near-custom compression bras. Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.S.M.: I would say this is an international problem. I was at the Australasian Lymphology Association meeting in Perth in March, and this issue of seeing more breast edema was a theme there. It seems to me that the compression garments and treatments available are not as advanced as they are for arm edema, the compression garments in particular. Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would agree with that to an extent. I think there are excellent compression bras that exist. I agree with you that we are as not highly evolved in this area in recognition, treatment, and management as we are with the arms. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S.: I would add one note of hope, and it is sort of anecdotal. I think this is one of the few times that lymphedema does have a tendency to regress. It's probably due to the acute injury of the radiation therapy. Breast edema does tend to go down over time, though it may not disappear. It is a very slow resolution of the edema and it's almost never complete. I generally tell patients to expect a very slow, ongoing improvement, even over 2 to 3 years after their radiation therapy, until they reach a stable plateau. I'd be curious if you two have found the same sort of better overall prognosis for the breast edema. It's real, and common and under-recognized, and can be treated. Let us know how you're doing.

I had a SNB on right (three nodes removed) and 4 nodes removed on prophylactic side (incidental). Which side should I have Blood pressure taken, blood draws or IVs? Can I safely return to backpacking? I usually carry a 38-40# pack for 5 to 7 days in the wilderness spending 6 to 8 hours with the pack on each day. Also, can I safely return to solo canoing on wilderness rivers. Usually 5-7 days of 6 to 8 hours paddling sometimes pretty continuous and I usually paddle almost always on my left. When my husband and I are not canoing or backpacking we are doing international travel and in the air for 6-12 hours. Is there any precautions I should be taking? Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/27/2010 some of the answer is going to depend on the location of these nodes. for example, the prophylactic side should have had no axillary dissection at all. so if nodes were removed check to see if they were merely nodes within the breast tissue-- probably the spence (tail) of the breast. there are mixed opinions about restrictions. some say not to worry with so few removed and others say to apply all the restrictions. make yourself an appt with a certified lymphedema therapist. this will be someone probably working in a rehab medicine center of the hospital where you had your surgery. Let her specifically advise you based on knowing your surgeon's preference and her own expertise. L www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/se...  I just came from a lymphedema conference (where I got to meet Jane Armer and ask her about her great article on the prevelance of LE--I almost asked her to autograph it) and heard again how early intervention makes all the difference.

Sara, I got lymphedema three weeks after surgery, with only three nodes out, due to heat exposure and a bug bite. And it's never gone away. It's my personal experience, it doesn't apply to all women, but it's real.  We look to the evidence, the published studies and clinical experience to try and understand lymphedema--what causes it and how to prevent it. And personally, I err on the side of caution. The stakes are just too high.  I can't add to the responses above except to say that I take great offense at your comments: \"Everyone has to make their own decisions?\" Only if they are based on accurate information. Lillie has taken her personal experience and extrapolated it into a universal truth. It isn't. I find your remarks to be the same--you haven't developed LE after using your at risk arm for blood draws, but your experience has an \"n\" of one. Even if the risk is low, if it happens to you, it's 100%, and it's life altering. I've learned that there's a surgeon at Hopkins, Lisa Jacobs, who has published on the incidence of LE after SNB in the Journal \"Lymphology\". Why isn't this expert, who is quite qualified, not answering the questions on the \"Ask an Expert\" site? http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/surgery/faculty/Jacobs  Why was her study on lymphedema, based at Johns Hopkins, terminated? clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NC...  Sara, you've never posted on this board before, to my knowledge, and I would ask that you do what Binney suggested, read the entire thread, and please don't admonish me that my tone is petty--I have a chronic condition and have had to fight to get acknowledgement and treatment for it, and I've read \"expert\" advice from Lillie Shockney that would put other women at risk for developing this condition, and I'm advocating for them. Sorry if that offends you. Kira ",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2010 06:54PM - edited Jun 4, 2010 07:08PM by kira Thank you for taking the time to respond, and I look forward to the revision of the information on lymphedema on breastcancer.org--a good start would be to remove the wording that makes this thread just for \"arm\" lymphedema. I started this thread, and my intentions were to bring to the forum a concern that those of us who have followed the \"Ask an Expert\" questions had about Ms. Shockney's advice to women who had had sentinel biopsy. It is true that much of the research in lymphedema is open to interpretation as there is no one gold standard to define it, but that is changing with the use of objective measurements such as perometry and validated surveys. Our recent literature review shows the risk of lymphedema after SNB to be anywhere from 7-91%, depending on how it is defined. A study written in 2004, with one of the authors being Lisa Jacobs, currently a surgeon at Johns Hopkins, showed a 22% incidence of lymphedema after SNB. Recent discussion with Jane Armer PhD indicated that aproximately 500,000 women who are surviving breast cancer, have lymphedema. Yes, the majority of women will not get lymphedema--but even that statement is subjective, as lymphedema depends on the definition of the condition. One study which surveyed  women who'd had breast cancer surgery, indicated that most have had some swelling, often transient. And that none of their doctors had asked about it, and few had mentioned it to their providers. This was not an effort to discredit Ms. Shockney, but rather to get some transparency about her direct medical advice to breast cancer survivors around lymphedema risk reduction practices. I for one, appreciate that Breastcancer.org does not give medical advice. I am very sensitive to NOT giving medical advice on the internet: I'm a professor at a medical school, and unlike Ms. Shockney, I have a terminal degree and board certification, but the only people who should be getting medical advice from me are those who have established a doctor/patient relationship. I do contribute to the website stepupspeakout.org, and we have a clear policy of never giving medical advice, despite our qualifications. But Ms. Shockney does give advice in her \"Ask an Expert\" forum, and she's featured on this site, as a breast cancer coach. Your mentioned that the desire to preserve quality of life may motivate the advice to ignore risk reduction behaviors. Quality of life is greatly impaired by lymphedema--believe me, I know. And, for many studies, since most my swelling is in my dominant hand, I may not meet their criteria for lymphedema, yet it has had a huge impact on my personal, social and professional life. I hope that as you revise your lymphedema pages, you do what Live Strong did for lymphedema, and use an expert, such as Jane Armer PhD who wrote their guidelines. A recent position paper by Andrea Cheville MD from Mayo Clinic on the use of hand protection with arm compression garments was so clear and well written, that I, for one, would welcome her input. As a health care professional--who cares for oncology patients, and a woman with secondary lymphedema, I don't agree with Ms. Shockney's advice. It's my professional and personal judgement.  This thread has generated a lot of respectful dialogue and sharing of information.  Thank you for your consideration. Kira ",

Binney has told me that many lymphedema experts find the lymphedema information on bc.org to be very out of date and inaccurate. I REALLY hope that they retitle this thread to include chest/trunk/breast lymphedema--it's not just arms, the entire quadrant is affected.  I'm working on getting statistics on lymphedema and time frames, the difficulty is that there is no one definition of lymphedema, and very few studies folllow women long term: however, Jane Armer has been following women, 250, for up to 8 years and we cited an her earlier publication in Journal of Lymphology, where she found the incidence to be around 41% using perometry and surveys, there was an article she published in 2004 looking just at sentinel node biopsy, and the incidence was 22% in a small group of women. She will be publishing her longer term follow up this year, I believe in Cancer, and will sort out lymphedema by SNB. There is an article in the literature, which just looked at other studies (and Dr. Armer has shown that other studies found between zero and 90%) and came up with the 7% figure that is quoted so much. I believe it was by McLaughlin.  Until we have a \"gold standard\" definition of lymphedema, it will always vary. The highest rate that Jane Armer found was the 2 cm diference--what she did was if a woman ever had a 2 cm difference at any one point during measurements, she was counted as LE: that was 91% of the women she followed, from diagnosis, and for the next 8 years. I had found one article that looked at ALND, and found that after 20 years, 50% of women had LE, with the vast majority getting it in the first few years, and then a few percent every year. When I met with Jane Armer, I told her how much I admire her LE handout for Live Strong, and she told me she was re-writing it, as it's a couple of years old. That's high standards. I hope bc.org adopts those standards for their LE pages. Swimangel, the moderators have made it clear that they consider Ms. Shockney a valued and respected expert.  I will work on trying to get as many facts as possible about incidence/prevelance and time frame. There was a recent BMJ, about a Spanish study, where all women got early intervention and they found it prevented LE--except for the women with extensive axillary web.  This thread has shown me the depth of the knowledge of the women who post here, and their concern for each other and other women who are at risk. I do hope, ultimately, it makes a difference. CS, I should go read the bc.org info on LE... Kira",

Some even have a pre-op visit with a lymphedema therapist for advice. Binney discovered that limiting the use of her arm--her first surgeon didn't want her to use anything above the elbow for the first week, was helpful. I'm going to put in a link for lymphedema risk reductions: www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnri... And to our website which has a lot of information on lymphedema www.stepup-speakout.org/index.htm From the American Cancer Society: www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCa... We have a section on what to do while waiting for a lymphedema therapy appointment, and I think it's a good general guideline for the first week after surgery: I've highlighted the points that apply: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#while%20waiting What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled. Karen, there is a condition where the lymph vessels get clotted, called axillary web, and I think it can be brought on by too much exercise, too soon, so I'd advise taking it easy for the first week or two, and don't worry about getting your range of motion back, work on it a bit later. Jackie: I'm so sorry you joined the swell sorority. I got it with just 3 nodes out. Are you getting treatment? Is it under control? Do you have a good lymphedema therapist? Can we help? Kira",

Here are two recent \"expert advice answers\" http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/viewquestions.asp?id=999805493 www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/se...  Asked Publicly Submitted Question 5/15/2010 I've had bilateral mastectomys and sentinel lymph node dissections. I haven't found much understanding in doctor's offices regarding not having my blood pressure taken in my arms or having blood drawn from the arm. So far, no lymphedema, but how insistent should I be regarding not having the blood pressure taken in the arm or having blood drawn from the arm? I checked with my local insurance covered lab and they can't draw blood from the leg and the medical assistants in local doctor's offices don't know how to do blood pressure in the leg. Thank you for you help. Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/16/2010 sentinel node biopsy was developed to reduce the risk of lymphedema by only removing one node--the sentinel node-- or known also as the guard node. if it is cancer free then no other nodes need to be removed. you probably had sentinel node done on one side with prophylactic mastectomy done on the other side. that said, those who have had axillary node dissections are to not have blood pressures or needle sticks done from the arm where the full ax dissection was performed. most women having sentinel node biopsy and the nodal dissection was limited to that node usually can still have blood pressures and needle sticks from that side. L  5/19/2010 Dear Lillie, I had a single mastectomy and SNB nearly 3 months ago. I have recovered well and aside from some joint pains from Arimidex, have resumed my exercise routine : brisk walking and yoga. We are planning a trip to a famous hotsprings area in northern Japan. In view of lymphedema risks, should I stay away from hot tubs and the like? Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/19/2010 good for you. hot tubs have proven to trigger or at least increase risk of developing lymphedema for women who have had full axillary node dissections. for women who have had only 1 node, the sentinel node removed, no such incidences have been reported that i'm aware of. personally, you need to decide for yourself. if i were going, i'd hop in. an opportunity of a lifetime that carries relatively low risk of causing a problem with only sentinel node having been removed. enjoy your trip! L  Okay, first, most sentinel node biopsies involve more than 1 node. And as our previous thread indicated, the risk is at least 5% for arm LE, higher for breast/trunk LE, and likely the arm LE risk is higher than 5%. How do we stop this expert from dispensing her dangerous medical advice? How do we get her picture off this web site as our expert coach? Her expert medical advice is wrong, and dangerous. You'd think the liability would provoke some oversight--from bc.org and the Johns Hopkins site.

      "Content": "Mar 29, 2012 08:46PM - edited Mar 29, 2012 08:48PM by kira I broke my LE hand in October 2010, and was in a cast for 6 weeks: my LE therapist came over on the day I broke it, and afterward, I saw her about about every 2 weeks for MLD of the fingers and above and when I came out of the cast, my hand was not in good shape--and she worked with me weekly.. In the cast, I wrapped my fingers at night, but no other compression. I did have to work with the cast techs to make the cast not too snug. One cast was misery, but I had it replaced and figured out the good cast techs. Post cast, it improved fairly rapidly, but there were  LE and weakness and pain issues. I'm never quite sure if it's exactly as well controlled as it was before the break, but I think it's very close to where I was pre-break. I tend to use minimal daytime compression, and wrap at night to control things. Weird, but it \"works\" for me. My LE therapist was invaluable for help during and after the break: and the wise advice of Binney and the women on the thread, because work was giving me a hard time about being out, and the hand surgeon said no writing, and it's my left, dominant, hand, and Binney said \"Give it time now, or expect to be dealing with it for a long time.\" Gave me the fortitude to stay out and elevate, and take care of myself. I needed OT for rehab after the break, and used a Norton trained OT for rehab: she still pushed my limits with the weights (no I can't start out with 20 reps four times a day...), but she adjusted to my needs quickly, and I didn't have to explain LE to her.

Like the original Arm Care, this sleeve has a soft dorsal support band that keeps the sleeve in place without a constricting upper arm band and now has compression that caps the shoulder. Solidea's extensive research, development and clinical testing of highly specialized fabrics and technologies has produced revolutionary compression garments. Luxurious and silky, the technologically advanced fabric is made with silver-ion bacteriostatic yarn to reduce bacterial growth and help disperse heat. Remarkably comfortable with a breathable, 3-way stretch circular knit that is proven to maintain consistent compression levels. ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN COMBINATION WITH A SILVER WAVE SLEEVE Each sleeve works a bit differently, one with higher compression to move fluid deeper and the Silver Wave with micro massage fabric that more fully activates the capalaties just below the skin in the lymph system. I use the Silver Wave to sleep and exersize in, and the Arm Care most days to keep any swelling at bay. I love the combination and now my swelling will stay down so that sometimes I don't wear any sleeve at all. Learn more on our website or call us with any questions at 888-841-8834.

It does seem to run its course in about 90 days--usually, but not always. Although the medical literature says it does not lead to LE, the PT literature says it's subclinical LE, because the lymphatics are scarred. One study followed patients with axillary web, and said 11% developed LE.  Personally, I developed axillary web syndrome 10 days post op, found it, googled it and had to explain what it was to the head of the LE clinic at the Breast Health Center. It seems so common, yet so many people who do breast surgery seem to know nothing about it.   My webs stretched from my axilla to my wrist, and there were a lot of them. There was an axillary seroma at the base of it. I did develop LE in my hand, in the area of pain from the cords.   At this point the webs are mostly gone, but I helped my daughter move into her dorm in late August and two cords popped up at my elbow--cords that I thought were gone.   The LE in my hand has persisted--it's mostly in my index finger now--but I keep being told that it's likely to improve as the scarring resolves. (I hope for, but no longer expect resolution.) My surgeon did aspirate the seroma last week--and it didn't completely go away, but it's much smaller.  Here are some references: the third one is really good, a physical therapist review of axillary web syndrome, including literature review.   www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11...  http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/517635/physical_therapy_may_promote_resolution_of_lymphatic_coding_in_breast/index.html http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3946/is_200401/ai_n9370189/pg_3 I did find the stretching really helped--it would loosen it up and I could reach out my arm again. So, the axillary webs do go away and stretches are helpful. And, an oncogene dx of 11 is great! Kira ",

I do have a new larger size readywrap gauntlet to try, but haven't yet. Personally, I wrap at night and wear a custom glove that is \"opera length\" during the day--as needed. I tried a lot of gloves also, before I found what works for me. I took the CLT course and we were given Caresia sleeves to try, and I actually found that the sleeve that has a thumb opening and allows me to gauze wrap my fingers underneath, and put 2 short stretches over, works pretty good for the days I'm sick of wrapping. It's the Caresia from MCPs to axilla. It is bulky, but it works for me. http://www.brightlifedirect.com/caresia-arm-liner-mcps-axilla.asp When I was hospitalized for my hysterectomy 2 weeks ago, my gyn oncologist got me permission to wrap, and I wanted them to be able to cut it off it there was an emergency, so I padded the hand with older gray foam and used three bandages, and it worked very well. Hands are really, really hard--so many variables, and an arm is simple cylinder (mainly) where a hand is flat, and often unless there is padding on the top/bottom, most of the pressure goes to the sides--it's called the \"Law of LaPlace\"",

Dear Editor, Mondor's disease, first described by Mondor in 1939,1 is an inflammatory vascular disorder characterized clinically by a linear subcutaneous nodule most commonly affecting the thoracoepigastric, lateral thoracic or superior epigastric region. There is currently no consensus whether this disorder is of venous or lymphatic vessel origin.2 We recently encountered a rare case of Mondor's disease developed in a cervical lymphatic vessel. This 20-year-old man was referred to our department for the evaluation of a subcutaneous induration on his left neck that was resistant to antibiotics prescribed by his internal medicine practitioner. On physical examination, a 5-cm long, Y-shaped, cord-like, moderately tender subcutaneous induration was detected (Fig. 1). Laboratory examinations of his blood including coagulation tests returned normal results. A biopsy specimen revealed that subcutaneous vessels were obstructed by organized thrombi and that the vessel walls were replaced by fibroblasts. Narrow recanalized lumens were seen in the area of organized thrombi (Fig. 2a). Weigert staining detected few elastic fibers in the affected vessels (Fig. 2b). Cells lining recanalized lumens and lymphatic vessels in the stroma were positive for D2-40, a specific marker for lymphatic endothelial cells (Fig. 3).3 Based on our clinical and histopathological findings, we made a diagnosis of Mondor's disease arising from lymphatic vessels. Figure 1. A rope of Y character type of approximately 5 cm in length subcutaneous tumor with an oppressive pain was admitted of his left neck. image Figure 2. (a) There were some middle-sized veins or lymph ducts which were blockaded and the walls were replaced by fibroblasts and many re-communicated veins or lymph ducts were observed by the blockaded part. (b) Elastica van Gieson stain, in comparison with the nearby vein, showed a few elastic fibers in the sick part. image Figure 3. The stain showed that the positive parts of D2-40 were on the endothelial cells of re-communicated veins or lymph ducts. image Most patients with Mondor's disease present with lesions on the chest wall; for example, the thoracoepigastric, lateral thoracic or superior epigastric region. Our review of the published work detected only two cases of Mondor's disease of the neck.3 Although the etiology of this disorder is unclear, it may reflect the response of the local vasculature to trauma, muscular strain, febrile illness or contact dermatitis around the affected vessel. As our patient is a carpenter who regularly carries heavy loads on his left shoulder that put strong pressure on the affected site on his neck, we posit that this occupational factor may underlie his development of Mondor's disease at this unusual site. Whether Mondor's disease arises from veins or lymphatic vessels remains unclear. In our case, immunohistochemical study showed positive staining for D2-40, a specific lymphatic marker, and the absence of elastic fibers in the vessel wall. These findings clearly demonstrate that the lesion arose from lymphatic vessels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Mondor's disease in which the lesion stained positive for D2-40. We presented a case of Mondor's disease with several peculiar features. First, the lesion was on the neck, a very rare site in patients with Mondor's disease. Second, occupational factors were involved in disease development and, third, there was immunohistochemical evidence that the disease was of lymphatic origin. To clarify the histogenesis of this disorder, other cases should be subjected to immunohistochemical study using D2-40 staining. Another study of the penis, stated it was lymphatic and yet another study of the breast, showed that in 14 patients, the cord was a vein or artery: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19... J Eur Acad Dermatol Venereol. 2008 Feb;22(2):168-73. Objective recognition of vascular lesions in Mondor's disease by immunohistochemistry. Ichinose A, Fukunaga A, Terashi H, Nishigori C, Tanemura A, Nakajima T, Akishima-Fukasawa Y, Ishikawa Y, Ishii T. Department of Plastic Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe University, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan. ichise@med.kobe-u.ac.jp Abstract BACKGROUND: Mondor's disease (MD) is considered an inflammatory condition of superficial vasculitis that develops mainly in the anterolateral thoracoabdominal wall. The pathogenesis of the disease has been controversial, however, because of the lack of histopathologic methods for differentiating between the small vein and the lymphatic vessel. AIM: To objectively examine the origin of vascular lesions in MD, we investigated the endothelial cells of their blood and lymphatic vessels. METHODS: Immunohistochemical examinations were carried out on specimens involving vascular lesions from 16 patients with MD, using antibodies against von Willebrand factor and human lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1, which specifically discriminate between lymphatic and blood vessels. RESULTS: The histopathologic findings clearly showed thrombophlebitis in 14 patients, a lesion originating in the lymphatic vessel in one patient, and sclerosis that consisted of the artery together with veins in another. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that almost all cases of MD are due to thrombophlebitis, with a small minority due to lymphangitis or other conditions. We believe this study will contribute to the better recognition of the factual changes in the condition designated MD. And a review of Mondor's: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19... Clin Exp Dermatol. 2009 Oct;34(7):753-6. Epub 2009 Jul 2. Mondor's disease. Alvarez-Garrido H, Garrido-Ríos AA, Sanz-Muñoz C, Miranda-Romero A. Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clínico Universitario de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain. helenaalvarezgarrido@hotmail.com Abstract Mondor's disease (MD) is a rare condition, which is considered a thrombophlebitis of the subcutaneous veins. It commonly occurs on the anterolateral thoracoabdominal wall, but it can also occur on the penis, groin, antecubital fossa and posterior cervical region. The clinical features are a sudden and typically asymptomatic onset of a cord-like induration, although some patients report a feeling of 'strain'. It is a self-limiting process that lasts a short period of time, which may be the reason why there are few reports about its diagnosis and treatment. Its pathogenesis has remained unclear, because of the lack of methods to reliably differentiate between veins and lymphatic vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for CD31 and D240 has been identified recently as the best method to distinguish small veins from lymphatic vessels, making it a valuable technique in diagnosing not only MD, but also many other diseases in which veins or lymphatic vessels are affected. MD has been associated with several systemic diseases such as breast cancer and hypercoagulability states, thus laboratory studies are recommended to exclude any possible systemic disorders. As this condition is usually a benign and self-limiting process, vigorous treatment is only recommended when the process is symptomatic or recurrent. So, it appears that Mondor's can involve lymphatics as well as veins and the use of the new staining methods makes it clearer that lymphatics are involved. So, Mondor's and Axillary Web likely have a clinical overlap.  Kira Knowledge is the antidote to fear, Ralph Waldo Emerson Dx 5/10/2008, IDC, 1cm, Stage IB, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Compression therapy in breast cancer-related lymphedema: A randomized, controlled comparative study of relation between volume and interface pressure changes. Damstra RJ, Partsch H. Department of Dermatology, Phlebology and Lymphology, Nij Smellinghe Hospital, Drachten, The Netherlands. r.damstra@nijsmellinghe.nl OBJECTIVE: Short stretch bandages are very effective in the initial management of arm lymphedema. However, no studies to date have measured the pressure required to achieve specific amounts of volume reduction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a difference between low and high-pressure bandaging in terms of therapeutically intended volume reduction of the compressed arm. METHODS: Experimental, randomized and comparative study with two study-groups consisting of high and low initial interface pressure bandages. Thirty-six hospitalized patients in Nij Smellinghe hospital suffering from moderate to severe unilateral breast cancer-related lymphedema not responsive to outpatient treatment were included. Bilateral arm volume was measured by inverse water volumetry before, after two hours and after 24 hours of bandaging. The amount of edema was calculated by subtracting the volume of the diseased arm from that of the contralateral side. Sub-bandage pressure was measured after bandage application and two hours later. Bandages were then re-applied and the pressure was measured again. Twenty-four hours later, the pressure measurement was repeated and bandages were removed for final volumetry. Patients were randomized into two groups: group A received low pressure bandages (20-30 mm Hg) and group B received high pressure bandages (44-58 mm Hg). The main outcome measures were reduction of arm volume and edema volume in the affected arm in both study groups. Secondary outcome parameters were changes in sub-bandage pressure and patient comfort. RESULTS: Median arm volume reduction after two and 24 hours was 104.5 mL (95% confidence interval [CI], 51.2-184.2) (-2.5%) (P < .0001) and 217 mL (95% CI, 143.9-280.2) (-5.2%) (P < .01) for group A and 56.5 mL (95% CI, -2.7-123.1) (n.s.) and 167.5 mL (95% CI, 105.2-316.1) (-4.2%) (P < .01) for group B, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the volume changes in group A and group B. After 24 hours, edema decreased by median percentage of 9.2% in group A and 4.8% in group B (n.s.). Bandages in group A were better tolerated. The sub-bandage pressure drop in the first two hours was between 41% and 48% in both treatment groups at both measuring sites. After 24 hours, the pressure drop was between 55% and 63%. No proximal swelling above the bandage was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Inelastic, multi-layer, multi-component compression bandages with lower pressure (20-30 mm Hg) are better tolerated and achieve the same amount of arm volume reduction as bandages applied with higher pressure (44-58 mm Hg) in the first 24 hours. So, based on that first experience of wrapping, it hurt and scared me and I didn't like it for many, many reasons. I did wrap, but got a jovipak glove that went to my forearm about a month later--unfortunately, it didn't compress my fingers well. So, I saw a PT at Mass General, and she taught me a hand/forearm wrap that took about 5-10 minutes to put on and off. Wrapping is psychologically painful and it makes you feel wounded--you look like you broke your arm. And, hopefully they'll figure out a way to treat you so you may not need to wrap at night--many women don't. But wrapping is an important tool to learn and employ to manage your LE. It's my index finger primarily--like Tender's--but it's definitely LE for me--and it's getting so much better. Sheila has posted on this board recently with hand LE: and first they used a glove, and then wrapped her, and now she's off of wrapping. I'd just recommend telling your LE therapist about this recent paper: because there's no clinical utility in putting on a tight wrap--if you ever need one. LE stinks. But it is manageable. Kira ",

My therapist doesn't do the tight wrap, so your hand turns blue and you are in pain, she wraps with enough pressure to keep the bandage smooth, and adds more bandages if she feels more compression is needed. Also, the gradient is important: more pressure in the hand and less as you go up the arm. Sounds impossible: but it IS possible--just vent away at first. Sharon has her husband help.

They can get bad quickly, so if it's red and sore and hot and if you feel feverish, please call one of your doctors, and at the very least, show it to the rad onc immediately tomorrow. Often rad onc's don't \"do medicine\"--but they've got to recognize a skin infection---especially if it's not in the radiation field. I don't want to scare you, but I don't want this to get missed because it can be very serious, and can make lymphedema worse. Hope it's just radiation skin reaction--but you can't be too careful Kira Here's a link to cellulitis and lymphedema http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm#CELLULITIS_%28INFECTION%29 CELLULITIS (INFECTION) If you have been treated for breast cancer, your hand, arm, underarm, breast/chest, and back on the affected side are at risk for developing lymphedema. Any area at risk for lymphedema is also at risk for serious and potentially life-threatening infection. That's why any symptom of infection needs to be treated as an emergency. Get medical attention immediately - DO NOT WAIT! The most common form of lymphedema-related infection is cellulitis. Here are some signs of cellulitis to keep in mind: * Warmth or tenderness when you touch your skin * Fever * Chills or general achiness * Pain * Itching * New or sudden swelling * Solid or splotchy areas of redness, or streaky red lines * Rash Get medical attention immediately - DO NOT WAIT! Infection may follow any break in the skin of the affected area, even breaks that seem trivial or unlikely, such as: * insect bites * hang nails * paper cuts * pin pricks * minor burns * scratches * blood tests, IVs, injections, draining of seromas But infections may also occur even when you can't identify any specific cause. Get medical attention immediately - DO NOT WAIT! Lymph fluid may stagnate in at-risk tissues even before a diagnosis of lymphedema is made. It is warm and protein-rich - a virtual feast for infection-causing bacteria. Once infection starts, it can spread rapidly throughout the affected area and beyond, threatening systemic involvement. Early treatment of any infection with antibiotics will stop it from spreading, hasten your recovery, and protect the lymph system from further damage. If oral antibiotics are not quickly effective, your doctor may admit you to the hospital for a course of IV antibiotics. Get medical attention immediately - DO NOT WAIT! Even if you recognize the symptoms of infection and understand the reasons for quick action, it can still be easy to ignore an impending problem or deny its seriousness. Here are some of the excuses you may be tempted to use to delay seeking medical help: * This can't be happening to me - I've been taking good care of my lymphedema. * If I call my doctor and tell him I think I have an infection from a paper cut, he's going to think I'm a nut/wimp/hypochondriac. * I'm sick of doctors and hospitals! * It's after hours and I'll have to go to the emergency room - who wants to wait five hours to be seen?! * Nobody in the emergency room will know what to do about lymphedema anyway. * No point panicking - it's more sensible to watch and wait. * I'll just try some Tylenol first and call the doctor in the morning. * Who ever heard of a hangnail causing an infection anyway! Get medical attention immediately - DO NOT WAIT! Here are some tips for dealing positively with the danger of cellulitis infection: 1. Prevent infection by following safe practices, including protecting yourself from cuts, pet scratches, insect bites, burns (including sunburn) and dry skin. 2. Carry antiseptic wipes, antibiotic ointment and band aids with you, and use them promptly for any skin break. 3. Talk to your doctor about keeping a supply of antibiotics on hand. Discuss guidelines for using them when a doctor is not available or an emergency-room wait may be too long. 4. If you suspect that an infection is developing, remove all compression garments or bandages and do not perform any self-massage. Compression and massage promote lymph flow and can contribute to the spread of the infection. 5. If you notice reddened areas on your skin, outline them with a permanent marker so you and your doctor can recognize progression or improvement over time. 6. At the emergency room or critical care, speak up promptly about your lymphedema or risk of lymphedema, and be prepared to remind the staff about your risk of cellulitis. 7. Be prepared for quick action. Have a small bag already packed to take you with you to the emergency room, with everything you'll need in case you're admitted to the hospital, including: * an up-dated medical history, including diagnoses, surgeries, hospitalizations (with dates), and current medications and supplements (with dosages) * up-to-date articles about cellulitis (Printer Friendly Version here) to share with your health-care providers * the names and phone numbers of all your doctors and your lymphedema therapist (and friends too, of course) * a notebook and pen * any LE alert bracelets or arm bands you might have * a bathrobe and comfortable non-slip slippers * toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, brush, shampoo, and whatever other daily care items will make you comfortable * a good book or two or a crossword puzzle book and a sharpened pencil * and a treat - a few packets of cocoa mix to add to hot water, for instance Follow your doctor's instructions for when to resume compression bandaging and self-massage for lymphedema. Usually that will be 24 hours after the start of antibiotic therapy if the infection is clearing and there is no pain. If you are allowed to resume massage before all redness is gone, avoid massaging over any reddened area. The infection will likely leave you with a lot of swelling. It may be helpful to make an appointment with your lymphedema therapist for a consultation or extra treatment as soon as the infection is under control.",

Kind of concerning, so I didn't get it, but I do think that strengthening your core muscles has to be good. Do you use a DVD, or just know how to do Pilates?    It's so hard to make treatment decision, and in some ways it's not fair to throw it in our laps. I hope the radiation oncologist can give you an honest assessment of the risks/benefits of radiation.   I live near Rhode Island School of Design, and when we first moved here, we lived on a street full of ceramics artists, and have some lovely ceramics from when they clear out their studios.   Hope you're back to making firsts soon.

There is some new concern that if the cords ultimately open up (and no one knows if they do) what exactly are people popping.  But the PT's who are expert in axillary web say if the cords aren't treated, you're at risk for LE. There's a study from Germany that talks about a \"hooking\" maneuver to manipulate the deep cords in the axilla. No one knows the best way to deal with the cords, just that they shouldn't be considered self-limited and not a risk: they can go away, but they can linger too. And they need to be treated if they hang in there. Glad you're doing so well, despite medical people trying to undermine your best efforts. Kira ",

You are the first person to mention the time of day issue--I've mentioned it to my LE therapist and she thinks it's due to fluid collecting during the day, but it's so predictable, I'm not sure that's the full answer. Daytime compression sleeves are not supposed to be worn at night--they can roll and cause constriction, and they're made to work with moving muscles. Nighttime garments are soft, chipped foam sleeves that feel like big oven mitts, or people wrap. So, the nighttime one is constructed differently to deal with the fact that our muscles aren't moving. If your sleeve feels tight it may be time to go back to your fitter and/or therapist and make sure it fits still. Kira Thanks for the mention of the \"circadian rhythm\" phenomena. ",

But, it could be a nice way to bandage, because you just wrap over it. I sent the first Tribute back as the fingers were too short and the hand wasn't snug enough. I find, personally, that the Solaris team are really easy to talk to, and email and I do it frequently--enough that they all knew me at the NLN conference--give Stephanie Gamble a call and discuss it with her. Her number is listed on their site. At the NLN, I discovered they've only been a company for 10 years, and I find them patient friendly. I had a great talk with JoAnn Rovig (jovipak) and her daughter--and we confirmed that the woman who fit me for my jovipak is a major flake. Just for me, I need the extra compression that is in the Solaris handpiece, although the jovi open fingered glove is beautifully sewn, it offers less compression in the fingers--but I really do have to give it another try.

Weight lifting doesn't cure or prevent lymphedema, no matter what it says on the PAL page at U Penn. I just bumped a good analysis of the weight lifiting issue. I broke my LE hand and used a Norton trained OT for hand rehab, and she had me do 20 reps with a 1 lb weight, twice a day, and it brought on tennis elbow and a flare.

I would like to point out something that struck me as I re-read the email that NatsFan received: they do NOT recommend compression for air travel with SNB. Mei Fu PhD from NYU is doing a current research study, and Jane/OneBadBoob, is the #188 patient in the study to develop lymphedema after flying without compression garments. There is a NLN position paper on air travel for women at risk. At the very least, women should be informed of the risk and have the appropriate garments to use if needed.  As there is no gold standard for diagnosing lymphedema, and symptom surveys are frequently used, the patient educator who emailed NatsFan would, by symptoms, have lymphedema. Yet she is unaware of that fact and advocates no risk reduction measures or evaluation. A recent position paper by Andrea Cheville MD of Mayo Clinic discussed how lymphedema is a dynamic and progressive process. Early identification, proper treatment are very important in preventing progression. The biggest risk for developing severe lyphedema, in a paper published by Cheville, is the presence of mild lymphedema. I've cited my oncology text about the deplorable yet all to common practice of therapeutic nihlism before, and will write it again: \"Therapeutic nihilism (i.e. no treatment at all) is deplorable, although common. The fact that the average clinician is ill prepared to recognize early stages of lymphedema must be remedied, because the sooner the treatment is started, the less treatment is required to prevent further progression.\" Thank you for reviewing this thread. We all stand ready to assist you with obtaining current and accurate information on lymphedema and its treatment. Kira",

The email story is an excellent analogy of how a change that doesn't personally impact you appears insignificant.  There is a great MD at Vermont, Patti O'Brien, who developed LE and researches it, Electra Paskett is a PhD who has it and researches it. We were in contact with a thoracic surgeon who developed a compression sleeve for his wife, an ob/gyn. In the local medical community around me, I only know of one other provider who has it, and because of shame, they tend to stay quiet about it. I work in medicine, and knew nothing about LE (I sent one woman with primary LE to the vascular surgeon who told us there was no treatment, and that was the sum of my knowledge), knew enough to worry about it before surgery, and getting it rocked my world and now in this weird twist of fate I started a new job in radiation oncology--a year ago-- (I was trained in primary care) and I see and treat LE every day.  When I returned from medical leave, struggling with dealing with my LE, I was abruptly fired from the primary care practice where I worked, for low productivity....In retrospect, a good thing, devastating at the time.  The response I got from my breast surgeon was anger and dismissal, and now we share care of patients all the time, and it's a bit tense, as I fired her. She dictates that she discusses LE now, but I see her patients all the time, and she still doesn't recognize it.  Personal experience trumps statistics every time. Kira ",

I haven't found much understanding in doctor's offices regarding not having my blood pressure taken in my arms or having blood drawn from the arm. So far, no lymphedema, but how insistent should I be regarding not having the blood pressure taken in the arm or having blood drawn from the arm? I checked with my local insurance covered lab and they can't draw blood from the leg and the medical assistants in local doctor's offices don't know how to do blood pressure in the leg. Thank you for you help. Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/16/2010 sentinel node biopsy was developed to reduce the risk of lymphedema by only removing one node--the sentinel node-- or known also as the guard node. if it is cancer free then no other nodes need to be removed. you probably had sentinel node done on one side with prophylactic mastectomy done on the other side. that said, those who have had axillary node dissections are to not have blood pressures or needle sticks done from the arm where the full ax dissection was performed. most women having sentinel node biopsy and the nodal dissection was limited to that node usually can still have blood pressures and needle sticks from that side. L  5/19/2010 Dear Lillie, I had a single mastectomy and SNB nearly 3 months ago. I have recovered well and aside from some joint pains from Arimidex, have resumed my exercise routine : brisk walking and yoga. We are planning a trip to a famous hotsprings area in northern Japan. In view of lymphedema risks, should I stay away from hot tubs and the like? Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/19/2010 good for you. hot tubs have proven to trigger or at least increase risk of developing lymphedema for women who have had full axillary node dissections. for women who have had only 1 node, the sentinel node removed, no such incidences have been reported that i'm aware of. personally, you need to decide for yourself. if i were going, i'd hop in. an opportunity of a lifetime that carries relatively low risk of causing a problem with only sentinel node having been removed. enjoy your trip! L  Okay, first, most sentinel node biopsies involve more than 1 node. And as our previous thread indicated, the risk is at least 5% for arm LE, higher for breast/trunk LE, and likely the arm LE risk is higher than 5%. How do we stop this expert from dispensing her dangerous medical advice? How do we get her picture off this web site as our expert coach? Her expert medical advice is wrong, and dangerous. You'd think the liability would provoke some oversight--from bc.org and the Johns Hopkins site.

This study considers the difﬁculties of diagnosing mild breast cancer-related lymphoedema particularly in relation to the natural differences between right and left arm volume. Methods: Arm volume was measured opto-electronically in 33 women treated for unilateral breast cancer and in 37 age-matched healthy women. The ipsilateral arms of the breast cancer group were also examined closely for clinical signs of lymphoedema. Results: On the basis of clinical examination, seven of the breast cancer group were found to have (previously undiagnosed) mild lymphoedema. The difference between ipsilateral and contralateral arm volume in three of these women was within the range of dominant minus non-dominant arm volume differences in the control group (and within 2 standard deviation [SD] of the mean difference). In the other four women, arm volume differences were outside the normal range (1-2 SD in one, greater than 2 SD in three). Conclusions: Measurement of arm volume may not detect mild lymphoedema and close inspection of the arm is necessary. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential, as are detection and reporting for healthcare prioritisation. Conﬂict of interest: None.

A key stumbling block is the possibility of triggering hand lymphedema when wearing a sleeve without a glove or gauntlet. Compression applied to the arm may reduce lymph flow from the hand. Even a normal lymphatic system works harder to drain lymph from the hand than other parts of the arm. This fact explains why hand lymphedema is often the most challenging to treat and why lymphedema specialists take great pains to prevent it. Concern that compression sleeves may inadvertently trigger hand lymphedema underlies the recommendation to always wear a compression gauntlet or glove with a sleeve. Most women at risk for lymphedema who have not noted increased arm volume, symptoms, or other indicators of early lymphedema wear their sleeves during activities that increase lymph production. Examples include airplane travel, vigorous aerobic or resistive exercise, and repetitive activities performed in an intense fashion. It is important that women using preventative compression sleeves combine their sleeve with either a gauntlet or glove during such activities. Particular attention should be paid to constriction at the shoulder band, elbow, and wrist crease. Sometimes overlap of a gauntlet and sleeve at the wrist can cause excessive pressure. For women with established lymphedema the decision to use a gauntlet or glove is based on slightly different considerations. Lymphedema of the upper limb may be distributed in a surprisingly patchy manner. For example, lymphedema may be restricted to the underside of the upper arm or the back of the hand. It goes unsaid that lymphedema is a very individual phenomenon. Many women with lymphedema never note hand involvement despite use of an arm compression sleeve for many years. However, even these women should remain watchful for hand swelling since lymphedema is a dynamic process with the potential to change over time. A quick check for hand edema after engaging in the activities listed above is always warranted. Differences in skin texture or the visibility of bones, veins and tendons may indicate lymphedema. These changes suggest a need to consider some form of hand compression. Of particular concern are women with lymphedema that plan to begin an exercise program or to significantly increase their activity and do not use hand compression. For these individuals use of hand compression during exertion is crucial until a stable level has been established. At that point a woman may carefully experiment with using a sleeve alone. However, it is always prudent and appropriate to use hand compression during vigorous arm activity. As previously noted, hand lymphedema is more difficult to control than arm lymphedema. The hand's irregular shape, its critical role in daily activities and the difficulty inherent in precisely fitting a gauntlet/glove all contribute to this problem. It is vital that early signs of hand lymphedema be taken seriously and that appropriate modifications are made to a patient's lymphedema maintenance program. In summary, a gauntlet or glove should be used in conjunction with compression sleeves when used for lymphedema prevention. Women with established lymphedema who have not required hand compression should consider adding a glove or gauntlet in situations that may increase lymph production in their arms. Many patients with lymphedema spend their entire lives well-controlled with use of a sleeve alone. A good comparison to the decision to wear a gauntlet/glove with a sleeve is that it is like buying insurance. The risk of having hand lymphedema is present in all women with arm lymphedema and those at risk. Adding a gauntlet buys some protection against this event and like all insured risk, we do not know who will be helped by the insurance and who might not even need it. Working with physicians and therapists skilled in lymphedema management will ensure that each woman develops a safe and effective compression plan tailored to her unique needs.  ",

Lymphedema, which can be managed but not cured, can leave a woman's arm significantly enlarged, greatly affecting her quality of life. According to statistics compiled by the American Cancer Society, the percentage of women who get lymphedema as a result of full node dissection and radiation ranges widely, from 6 to 48 percent. While studies concur that sentinel node biopsy reduces the risk of lymphedema, the rates vary depending on a number of factors, such as whether the woman received radiation. But it doesn't eliminate the risk, says Wendy O'Rear, PT, a certified complete decongestive therapist at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. The huge variation in statistics also reflects that whether someone gets lymphedema depends on a number of factors, including location of the tumor, body mass index, age, physical condition and other medical conditions that can contribute to unbalanced fluid levels in the body. O'Rear treats women with lymphedema using complete decongestive therapy, which clears lymphatic pathways of fluid and decompress fluid-filled areas to allow the limb to return to normal or near-normal size. Patients then may use special compression garments to prevent the arm from re-swelling while learning exercises to help the arm eliminate fluid. \"Who gets lymphedema varies, and it's multifactoral,\" says O'Rear. \"I have had women who had sentinel node surgery who swelled immediately, and then I have another patient who had surgery 38 years ago when they took all the nodes and followed it with radiation-and she just got lymphedema.\" Typically, O'Rear says, she sees fewer women with immediate problems if there were fewer than 10 nodes removed and there was no radiation. She emphasizes that it's important for women to understand that the fluid in the tissue contains protein, which is inflammatory and produces scar tissue. When lymphedema is not controlled, it will increase in severity, she says. O'Rear emphasizes that women need to be vigilant for the rest of their lives and follow the guidelines from the National Lymphedema Network (www.lymphnet.org) to reduce their risk. \"We have had women tell us that someone told them that after five years they could begin getting blood pressure taken on the affected arm, and that isn't true,\" O'Rear says. In fact, she says, as women age and their tissue becomes more firm, particularly if they have had radiation, they can lose lymph function faster.

One woman, I made sure she had prophylactic antibiotics to travel with, and it turned out to be a good thing, as she developed a whopping breast cellulitis in a country with less than optimal health care. She took the antibiotics and flew back. She brought back the records in another language--they insisted she be admitted, but she was terrified of the health care--wisely, IMO. So, back to Cookiegirl (and I did get confused with Cookiegal here): if you have hand swelling, you should be evaluated by a LE therapist ASAP and strongly consider getting well fitting compression garments for the flight--to include your hand and arm. You said you only have problems in flights over 4 1/2 hours--if I read the first post correctly--and that concerns me too, that you've swollen with air travel before. Lymphatic transport capacity is our body's ability to remove lymph fluid from a quadrant of the body: it is lowered by surgery and radiation and can be overwhelmed by high demand and when it's overwhelmed, lymphedema develops, and for some strange reason, once that threshold is crossed you have the condition permanently, although with good treatment, many women (and men) find it regresses to a very minimal stage. So, you don't want to overwhelm the body's capacity to remove lymph fluid, and you're at a precarious place at the end of rads, as the quadrant is inflammed--bringing more lymph flow to it--so I'd advise getting a LE therapist evaluation and strong consideration of well fitting garments for flight--they can be lower compression--15-20mm for the sleeve, but strongly consider them and get the hand swelling evaluated. Just my opinion.

The fact that you have hand swelling is a \"red flag\" that you may be developing lymphedema, and should really be evaluated, and get a referral to a qualified therapist, as few physicians are able to make the diagnosis and none are trained to treat it. Stacey: ACE bandages have too high of a resting pressure and can put so much pressure on the skin that they can collapse and harm lymphatics. A better approach may be to get fitted for compression garments. In lymphedema, the short stretch bandages look like ACE bandages, but they don't have the high stretch.",

It's impacting our family. I expect to fly wrapped. The key to wearing a sleeve/gauntlet/glove while flying is that it is well fitting. A poorly fitting compression garment can cause problems, so make sure it fits well before flight. You mention both sleeve and wrapping: if you wear a sleeve, make sure to get a gauntlet/glove. If you wrap, be sure you know how to wrap. I hate my LE limitations, and this one is self-imposed. I do know women have posted here about taking precautions and still developing LE: while there was this article on women who flew without sleeves to a dragon boat regatta, and bc.org concluded sleeves may not be necessary, yet Otter did a brilliant anaysis of the article, and it proved nothing of the sort--women on longer flights did develop LE, and these were trained athletes. The risk may be low, but the consequences are high. Kira",

For truncal swelling, many women buy underarmour shirts, short sleeve--I hear the men's fit better--in a snug fit and wear them inside out. There is no question that people with lymphedema should wear compression when they fly: the controversy is for people \"at risk\" and unfortunately, the medical studies are just plain horrible, so we just don't know, and people are different. Personally, even before LE, my ankles would swell on an airplane.

I wrote to the NLN about my concerns, as well fitting mild compression offers little risk, and it's impossible to predict who will get LE after a flight, and they told me to F##k off. Seriously. There was a study that the NLN loves, done by Nicole Stout, in 2008 where she put ALL the women in a jobst sleeve and gauntlet, and decided that she helped women hold off LE (impossible to tell, as she had no control group) and that study has started a whole movement and NLN position paper on early detection of LE. So, I asked, why is compression safe when Nicole Stout does it to all post op women and dangerous when a physician/LE therapist/woman at risk decides to use it on a flight? Again, I was told to go away, in not nice terms. One researcher told me, off the record that she always worried about how well the compression fit the women in the Stout study, but the official response from the NLN was that compression is always safe in a study. Really?????? So, with these new guidelines, therapists are telling women that compression could cause harm and only time will tell if more women fly without it and get LE. Jane/Onebadboob, was in a study at NYU and the grad student told her she was like the 200th woman to get LE after plane flight, and the investigator told the grad student to be quiet, and she doesn't support compression on plane flights--with no real evidence to support her belief. Sure don't want any more sisters of swell. If it could be avoided. I fly wrapped also. And wear compression knee highs. Kira",

Next was a 5 hour flight. The irony is that I fly a couple of hours twice a year for board meetings for a Lymphedema organization, and I fly twice in two days and it tends to beat me up. I forgot, I flew around four hours to the last NLN conference. My parents live on the other coast, and I haven't managed the six hour flight yet. I just arranged for a cell phone for my younger daughter who is meeting a friend in Costa Rica, she had some medical issues that were exacerbated by flying, but since she's got them under control, she's been to Europe twice and Israel. Me, not so willing to take long flights. I used to struggle with sinus infections after flying, but LE brings a whole new level of risk and concern. I totally agree with Ohio, it's a risk and we need to be mindful, but we need to be mindful of limitations set by LE.",

The solution for me was to get a custom glove, a Juzo that goes to the mid-forearm, but I tend to wear it intermittantly. There was a time, when I flared a few years ago, that I was primarily in finger wraps to control hand swelling as the gloves were useless. As the control of your LE improves, you will possibly need less compression, but if you're still visibly swelling, I'd suggest going back to your fitter/LE therapist and working with them for a better glove/sleeve combo. Couple of questions: do you have arm swelling? If not, the sleeve can push fluid into the hand. Lousy compression traps fluid, and that swelling of the hand after the glove comes off--it's something I've experienced--and it suggests fluid trapping. Great for you that you don't swell at night and that everything goes down. The wrinkles are from stretched skin over an area without a lot of fatty tissue benigth it--the \"dorsum\" of the hand. Our arms are full of fat/muscle and don't tend to ever visisbly wrinkle, although when they have retained lymphatic fluid, they swell, feel full, look lighter and feel \"dense\". Compression garments and good fitters require trial and error, and right now, it sounds like error, and time for a trial. And you may not need them all day long--it sounds like you're doing better without them right now, as they're trapping fluid. I'd suggest a call to the LE therapist/fitter. Hope that helps Kira",

Show it to your doctor if you get any grief, and get a script for what ever antibiotic you are not allergic to that works for cellulitis--a lot of women here get keflex or augmentin or cipro. www.lymphedemablog.com/2010/10... When I was at the radiation oncology practice, a lot of women would fly just as radiation was over, to celebrate, and one woman really worried me, and I got her a keflex prescription, and sure enough, she got a whooping breast cellulitis in Punta Cana, and they wanted to admit her, and she took her keflex and came home--she brought me medical records in spanish.

Can only hope.. http://lymphaticnetwork.org/news-events/shedding-light-on-a-lymphedemic-national-lymphedema-awareness-day-march-6-2 Shedding Light on a Lymphedemic, National Lymphedema Awareness Day, March 6, 2014 March 2014  by William Repicci, LE&RN Executive Director When I was first introduced to the field of lymphatic disease and lymphedema, I was most struck by how little I knew about these diseases. Having worked extensively in the area of congenital defects and infectious disease, both in the US and Africa, how was it that a disease that affected some 10 million Americans and hundreds of millions worldwide remained shrouded in such silence? As I learned that more people in the US suffer from lymphedema than multiple sclerosis, AIDS, muscular dystrophy and Parkinson\u2019s disease combined, my confusion only grew. Most people I knew were intimately aware of these other diseases. Yet, mention lymphedema and I routinely got blank stares. Two such moments cemented my resolve that a change was in order. In the first, a University Dean, having never heard of lymphedema, asked me to explain it. When I did, she exclaimed, \u201cMy mother has that! She had breast cancer and her arm is now severely swollen. Tell me the name again?\u201d The second incident was talking to a doctor and his wife. After describing lymphedema, she raised her leg and said, \u201cI have that. My doctor said it was drainage issues. What did you call it?\u201d If patients aren\u2019t aware of the name of their disease, they are robbed of the support that comes from knowing they are not alone. By not feeling connected to a larger group, the power of numbers to create awareness fails to find a voice and the potentially powerful advocacy of family and friends is muted. Adding to the dilemma is a medical profession that has too often instilled in patients the idea that there are worse things than lymphedema, and that suffering quietly is a noble approach. Yet, when I talk to cancer survivors with lymphedema, they are most likely to say, \u201cMy lymphedema is worse than my cancer. They cured my cancer. Lymphedema is forever.\u201d Suffering in silence results in only one thing\u2014society\u2019s collective yawn. Let others decide the pecking order of what is most important. Change comes when we demand it. Change comes when people don\u2019t take \u201cNo\u201d for an answer. Change comes when groups coalesce around a compelling cause and systematically advance their agenda in every forum imaginable. Whereas there are pioneer groups changing this, such as National Lymphedema Network, Lymphedema Treatment Act, and LE&RN to name just a few, it remains a challenge to make headway if the patient population doesn\u2019t self-identify with their disease or promote dialogue on the subject. We need a national education campaign that addresses the impact of lymphatic disease and lymphedema. We need substantial increases in funding for research. We need a notable spokesperson to come forward and advocate for awareness and funding. We need our politicians to become champions in this cause. March 6th is National Lymphedema Awareness Day. In support of patients and LE&RN, the New York State legislature will read a resolution on both chamber floors acknowledging this day. In addition, they will read a resolution honoring LE&RN\u2019s youth ambassador, seven-year old Connor Looby. The legislature will also be voting on a funding request for LE&RN\u2019s National Patient Registry and Tissue Bank. We can also announce that LE&RN is soon to receive a $500,000 bequest from a woman honoring a brother who suffered from lymphedema throughout his life. These funds will be used for fellowships in lymphedema research. Progress is being made. When we changed our name to Lymphatic Education & Research Network\u2014LE&RN, it was a statement that we had redoubled our efforts to spearhead education and advocacy as well as research. As such, we will continue to expand our free live-stream symposium series featuring the world\u2019s leading researchers and medical practitioners. We will continue to expand our new website with user friendly features such an \u201cAsk the Expert\u201d forum. We will continue to grow our social media, bringing you the daily highlights in the field and at LE&RN. We will use all of our human resources to advocate for the Lymphedema Treatment Act and an increase in research funding\u2014federal, corporate, and private. Finally, we prepare to award new research fellowships this summer, guaranteeing that the best and brightest are welcomed into this field. With funding always an issue, many of our goals remain elusive; e.g., a national hotline, lymphatic disease curriculum in medical schools, a national lymphedema education campaign, state chapters, and outreach to expand our patient registry and tissue bank. Instead, we hear how federal funding of lymphatic disease and lymphedema research is diminishing at such an alarming rate that we are in danger of losing a new generation of researchers. There is only one road to success: fearless determination by those who stand the most to gain. As we approach National Lymphedema Awareness Day, we at LE&RN call upon all those with lymphatic disease and lymphedema and all those who champion their cause to make their voices heard. ** William Repicci is Executive Director of the Lymphatic Education & Research Network (LE&RN).

      "Content": "Aug 16, 2012 11:17AM - edited Aug 16, 2012 11:20AM by kira L to the K: I sure wish we had good studies to guide us, right now, there are 3--The Australian Dragonboat flying study, which used a single bioimpedance measurement, and found some LE in the women making the longer flights--discussed on SUSO: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/research_updates_and_comments.htm#Compression_garments--and these were athletes, the 2002 Graham study where he asked his patients how they did, and an older Casely-Smith study. So, no real science to guide us, specifically on LE and compression garments. I think there is no controversy on if you already have LE--you should compress to avoid a flare, worsening/spread The controversy is women at risk. The arguement that compression can cause harm is out there, you hear it clinically. One researcher at NYU strongly believes that compression makes lymphatics lazy--but I've never seen a single study to support her contention, and then we have the Nicole Stout study in 2008 where she put Jobst sleeve/gauntlets on all post op women (no control group) and declared that early intervention prevents LE. Compression increases the pressure to increase lymphatic absorption, but it sure can trap fluid as no compression fits like a second skin. I would say, for women at risk, monitor yourself when you exercise--for symptoms, swelling--and if there are none, then don't use compression. Plane travel is a risk due to barometric pressure changes, dehydration, lack of movement and carrying bags. I think each woman at risk should review their risk with their doctors (if they know anything about LE) and their LE therapists and then decide. A PT who I admire a lot recommends a 15-20 mm sleeve--Jobst and now Sigvaris make them--with a 20-30mm gauntlet for flying, for women at risk who decide to wear compression. It's just so hard, because you can't predict who will swell, what their baseline lymphatic transport capacity is--and there are two new studies that show that when LE presents, the lymphatic pump starts to poop out in the good side as well over time, so it's a whole body insult--and a genetic study that shows that some women who get LE with minimal insult may have a genetic predisposition to LE--a gene that is present in primary LE. The new NLN guidelines have made therapists very cautious, as they cite the Graham (useless) study and say \"compression may cause harm\"--when a therapist sees the NLN say that, they are worried about causing LE with compression. So, we don't have studies to go by, and we have to go by clinical experience, and individualize the approach for each woman. Here's the abstract for Graham: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14965648Breast. 2002 Feb;11(1):66-71. Compression prophylaxis may increase the potential for flight-associated lymphoedema after breast cancer treatment. Graham PH. Source Cancer Care Centre, St George Hospital, Kogarah, NSW, Australia. p.graham@unsw.edu.au Abstract This study aimed to assess exposure to flying in breast cancer survivors and assess the relationship of flying to lymphoedema. A total of 293 relapse-free breast cancer survivors with known pathology and treatment details and prospectively measured arm circumferences were surveyed for their flight exposure and precautions history. Of these, 287 responded, with a mean follow-up of 31.6 (4-111) months. A total of 50.5% had flown, and of these, 27% had travelled overseas. The mean number of flights was 5.3 (1-100); 24% had taken lymphoedema precautions, 90% of which utilized compression techniques. There was no significant difference in lymphoedema rates for fliers (11.2%) and non-fliers (8.3%). No woman reported permanent (new or increased) swelling after flying. Of the nine reporting temporary swelling, six reported 1-3 concurrent potential risk factors. On regression modelling for both measured and self-reported swelling endpoints the use of precautions (OR 5.6 for lymphoedema and 3.7 for flight-related temporary swelling) were statistically significant. For patient-reported swelling, the number of positive nodes (OR 1.2) and the number of overseas flights (OR 1.4) was also significant, whereas for clinical lymphoedema age (OR 1.07) was significant. We conclude that domestic air travel (<4.5 h) is low risk and that compression devices are possibly counterproductive Just to explain: his prospective measurement was that he measured these women at two points, during his surgical follow up. He did not bring them back after flying. His evaluation of LE was self reported swelling.He asked them about it once, and their time post op varied from 4-111 months. No subsequent questioning. So, his initial assessment was a two point arm measurement and his diagnosis of LE was based on patient report. 143 women had flown, we don't know which group took multiple or longer flights or how far post op they were, and of this group, 24% took LE precautions--34, of which 31 wore compression. So, around 10% of his varied group of patients flew with compression. He does state that more nodes and longer flights was significant, but this is all self reported and not observed, validated, clarified, or followe up. So even in a quick survey with no real science, longer flights seemed to pose risk. This was in the age of ALND So, the NLN took his final conclusion, as a scientific fact, when his \"study\" can't conclude anything. So, we're out here in the wilderness trying to figure out what to do, and I would say, go with your personal risk and personal symptoms, and if you've swelled on flights before and make a decision, and make sure if you get compression, it fits well. Does that help? Kira",

Personally, I wrap at night and then don't have much need for daytime compression. Sometimes I wonder if I need to wrap every night--and my LE therapist tells me that if I don't wrap and I swell, I'll know right away. Because it's worked so well for me, I keep doing it. Also, it seems like improvement is possible, and so are flares, so we need our tools and someone to help us figure out when to use them. It's doable, it really is, it just feels like--and is--a burden and yet another thing to deal with. Kira",

The bc.org interpretation was that compression garments were NOT needed for flying, but closer reading showed that some women flew to Australia from Canada, and some took a short flight, and some women DID develop LE. Otter did a great summary of it, I agree that Dr. Schmidtz does say to work up slowly, and her PALS trial will be in the NE Journal soon, and it was women with LE who worked with trainers. I'm eargerly awaiting the article. But there is this trend to tell us to try anything: the same ask the expert had a woman with ALND and radiation to the nodes ask if it was safte to to do yoga abd they said YES. Mei Fu Phd cautions against downward dog. And that person has a 50% chance of LE, so I'd rather they said, try it with well fitting compression, and only briefly at first. My swelling is similar to yours--mostly in the fingers, and it was just the index finger until I grabbed the mattress, and now it's the \"expressive\" middle finger as well. And some on the top of my hand. I've been working hard on it and it's better, but still stubbornly in that middle finger.... I used to be a kayaker, avid tennis player, helper of college kids move their fridges into the dorm, horseback rider. Now I do Tai Chi and Lebed. I'm just not ready to try tennis--I'm left handed and it's in my left arm and I used to get horrible tennis elbow. I do have limitations. I just don't want this movement to help us cast aside the fears that are holding us back to be unrealistic. Our concerns are based on our reality of flaring. I don't want our horizons limited uneccesarrily, but as Linda said--we live with our arms. Kira",

And worse, IMO, the NLN based their recommendations on compression and flying on a study that is far, far worse than this: one surgeon \"thought\" about his patients.

Early AWS is painful, and then the acute phase eases and sometimes all the cords go away, and sometimes one or two linger for a long time. The treatment is gentle stretching, manipulation of the cords by the PT and anti-inflammatories. Because you're at risk for LE--and it seems especially high during the acute phase--go easy on the arm--avoid straining it. Recently there has been interest in oncology rehab, and more PT's understand cording, but they also have to understand that you need to avoid repetitive arm movements that might strain the muscles, but still stretch and progress with exercise gradually. Hope she consults with or sends you for an LE eval--and hopefully the LE PT is comfortable treating cords--talk to her/him before you make the trip. The good news about cording is that it does get better. You just need to be cautious while going through this. Kira",

All the medical literature says axillary web is self limiting, and not linked to LE: but just this year the International Best Practices in LE came out and said webbing is linked to LE (it's thrombosed lymph vessels). I've corresponded with two PT's who specialize in axillary web, and both have told me that the webs can persist for years and they feel that until the webs are addressed, the lymph flow is compromised. There's a link to the International Best Practices Article on the right side of the page http://www.stepup-speakout.org/index.htm  I'm 7 months post op, and can still bring out a couple of webs, and I just saw my PT today and she worked on them, and I'll see her again in a few weeks. And I'm hyper-compliant with self MLD (twice a day) , the prescribed exercises (twice a day), night wrapping--my PT told me to put the jovipak in my sock drawer, and wear my glove during the day. It gets depressing, because I do \"everything right\" and that darn hand/finger are still puffy. But seeing my PT today was so helpful. She explained some studies that show that women with hand swelling have a tendency to poor forearm drainage in both arms (even the good one) and showed me how to work on the forearm, and was very reassuring in general.   My worst cording went away about 6 weeks after it started, but some cords hung in there for months, they won't show unless I put traction on the skin. Jane Kepics updated her axillary web article on the Vodder site: she told me that when they finally said cording and LE were linked, her response was \"about time.\" The good news is that a good PT and stretching can resolve the cording. The Burt book on LE explains some home techniques for massaging the cords as well. Diane--I hope your radiation oncologist is helpful--mine wasn't, unfortunately. Also, check out that whatever PT you see is adequately trained in LE. Many PT's do a very short course in LE because they believe that being a PT prepares them to do LE work, but an article in the journal Cancer demonstrated that PT schools teach little to no LE therapy. My PT is CLT-LANA. Axillary web article: http://www.vodderschool.com/treatment_of_axillary_web_syndrome Kira ",

      "Content": "Jul 3, 2010 09:07AM - edited Jul 3, 2010 09:08AM by kira Emme, cording does come back--sometimes I think that the really scarred down cords are lurking and then flare up. My cords have come back from exercise. And they've gone away pretty quickly with stretching exercises and gentle traction on the cord. The idea of popping the cord is not endorsed by Jodi Winicour or Jane Kepics--if it's done intentionally--but, if a cord pops because the therapist working on the tethered tissue, it's considered okay. There was a question once on an ask the expert from bc.org, and the reply was kind of short, but let me see if I can find it. Well, I found it, but I am very opposed to the \"expert\" who answered it--she's a PT who does weekend courses for LE, pushes weight lifting for all women with LE, and calls herself \"doctor\" but has a bachelor's degree. I've been worked on by a therapist trained by her, and she was, unfortunatley, clueless: So, from a woman I think should be avoided or only dealt with with full knowledge of her biases and her belief that 16 hours of training makes a good LE therapist, here's her reply http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/planning/ask_expert/2008_05/question_10.jsp  What is axillary web syndrome? Page last modified on: August 20, 2008 Question from Patti: Can you provide information on axillary web syndrome (AWS)? I had an occurrence almost 3 years after surgery -- a lumpectomy with removal of 3 or 4 sentinel nodes and follow-up radiation. There is very little information on the subject, and my doctor said it is not very common. Thank you. Answer -Linda Miller, P.T.: It's not unusual to have axillary web syndrome, or post-operative cording months or even years post-operative. Often times it's precipitated by a sudden increase in activity, especially if you haven't been doing regular stretching, which a lot of women kind of stop doing as time goes on. The best way to treat it is to restart your general stretching, lifting the arm up over your head while keeping your elbow straight. Here's from Jane Kepics PT, who really is a doctor--she has a PhD in physical therapy: this is her first article, and it's great, IMO findarticles.com/p/articles/mi... I do question their statement about resolution of symptoms. I often see patients months to years after surgery who have never achieved full ROM in the operative shoulder. These women complain of tightness and tenderness in the axilla, and at times, extending into the chest wall. Their shoulder posture is slightly protracted with a mild thoracic kyphosis in an effort to protect the operative site. I suggest that perhaps the syndrome didn't totally resolve. As with lymphedema, patients stop complaining to their surgeons and learn to 'live with it.' Another paragraph: Skin traction is another beneficial technique. I gently stretch one or two inch segments of the cord with my thumb and index finger. This can be done all along the arm, in the axilla and on the chest wall. I usually include the area around the scar where the JP drainage tube was located, as I often find cords as far down as that scar. Occasionally, I can feel a pop or a snap where the cord actually breaks in the antecubital fossa or in the axilla. It is not painful and the patient usually feels an immediate increase in mobility. In a personal communication with Dr Moe, I wondered if breaking the cords was a safe practice. he questioned if we were actually breaking the cord or rather the supporting fibrous structures around them. I have not seen any ill effects of this practice and patients tend to maintain their newfound ROM without any increase in swelling.  Myofascial release techniques such as the 'arm pull' and stretching of the pectoralis major and minor, the intercostals and rib cage, the biceps and triceps, and the diaphragm release are also very helpful in stretching out the axillary web.4 Gross scar release techniques both in parallel and perpendicular to the breast and axillary scars, as well as skin rolling techniques and vertical lifts of the scars, may also be beneficial. Now I realize this is written with a lot of medical jargon, but I hope it makes sense. Another PT who is expert in AWS had two patients swell after popping their cords--after treating hundreds with no problem--so she's become very cautious about popping the cords. Hope this makes sense, if it's too medical, let me know. Kira",

      "Content": "Sep 25, 2011 06:46AM - edited Sep 25, 2011 06:56AM by kira Lisa, there are times when our lymphatic system is more stressed--like right after surgery, while on chemo, during rads--and right after pregancy, there is a general relaxation of connective tissues--seriously, your body creates something called relaxin, to help the pelvis stretch for delivery--so you kind of hit the trifecta of risks, and then lifted your little girl up and triggered the swelling. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxin : In animals, relaxin widens the pubic bone and facilitates labor; it also softens the cervix (cervical ripening), and relaxes the uterine musculature. Thus, for a long time, relaxin was looked at as a pregnancy hormone. However, its significance may reach much further. Relaxin affects collagen metabolism, inhibiting collagen synthesis and enhancing its breakdown by increasing matrix metalloproteinases.[6] It also enhances angiogenesis and is a potent renal vasodilator. [edit]   Now you're stable, and there's no need to over treat.  One of the researchers we work with, Mei Fu PhD from NYU, feels like compression if used when not needed, can cause the lymphatics to become \"lazy\", and my LE therapist is always worried about compression trapping fluid. So, I would vote that you should only wear compression when needed,  and I'm so glad things got better, and you were so proactive about treating it early. (There was a study done on post op women, and if their arms swelled a bit, they were put in compression, and most came to a point where they no longer needed it. It's not clear if the early use of compression prevented progression, or they were at a vulnerable point, but whatever the mechanism, it worked. Study done by Nicole Stout about three years ago.) Here's the abstract: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.23494/abstractThe incidence of breast cancer (BC)-related lymphedema (LE) ranges from 7% to 47%. Successful management of LE relies on early diagnosis using sensitive measurement techniques. In the current study, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of a surveillance program that included preoperative limb volume measurement and interval postoperative follow-up to detect and treat subclinical LE. METHODS LE was identified in 43 of 196 women who participated in a prospective BC morbidity trial. Limb volume was measured preoperatively and at 3-month intervals after surgery. If an increase >3% in upper limb (UL) volume developed compared with the preoperative volume, then a diagnosis of LE was made, and a compression garment intervention was prescribed for 4 weeks. Upon reduction of LE, garment wear was continued only during strenuous activity, with symptoms of heaviness, or with visible swelling. Women returned to the 3-month interval surveillance pathway. Statistical analysis was a repeated-measures analysis of variance by time and limb (P ≤ .001) comparing the LE cohort with an age-matched control group. RESULTS The time to onset of LE averaged 6.9 months postoperatively. The mean (±standard deviation) affected limb volume increase was 83 mL (±119 mL; 6.5% ± 9.9%) at LE onset (P = .005) compared with baseline. After the intervention, a statistically significant mean 48 mL (±103 mL; 4.1% ± 8.8%) volume decrease was realized (P < .0001). The mean duration of the intervention was 4.4 weeks (±2.9 weeks). Volume reduction was maintained at an average follow-up of 4.8 months (±4.1 months) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS A short trial of compression garments effectively treated subclinical LE.

Binney has asked Elizabeth Edwards to go public about her LE: she's written an expose about her marriage, but won't touch her LE. What does that say about the disease, and the stigma attached to it? I am also distressed by how much it consumes and impacts my life, and how my physicians are unaware of it. There's a general attitude that they saved my life, so just quit complaining about your swollen arm. I hate October, because the theme is all about being positive, and LE is missing from the dialogue. And buying a pink vacuum cleaner that I'd have to push with a compression sleeve on, isn't going to make me feel like I'm being supported. Sorry to rant. Kira",

Don't beat yourself up about doing your homework--we place trust in the physicians who refer us, and this is all uncharted territory. Binney and Jane created stepupspeakout.org is response to the lack of information out there, and asked me to help them, and I learned so much. As we discovered, you can check a therapist's qualifications, but so much is individual--how many lymphedema patients they see, how dedicated they are, how the clinic is run. Binney tried to \"report\" a therapist to LANA, and was told that they just give the test, they don't monitor the therapists--so LE therapists are out there operating without much physician supervision (because most physicians don't know much about LE) and without any oversight from any licensing board or LE training school. So mileage does vary, and thank goodness you're getting the care you deserve. Doesn't it bug you how much they get away with charging? $360/hour. Unbelievable. When I first got treated, it was at a clinic staffed only by massage therapists, and my co-pay was $75 a session, and they were run by a nutritionist who is untrained in lymphedema, as \"alternative therapy\". I couldn't believe how much I paid for horrible care. When I found my current therapist on the LANA site, I decided that paying her out of pocket (she was previously at a branch of the hospital clinic, where they got reimbursed the $360/hour), but on her own, my insurance rejects the claim, as she's not a PT/OT, but the cost is the same, and the care is wonderful. Let us know how you're doing. Kira",

Good that she got results--I hope she was bandaged after this \"MLD\" I'd love to have a really good reference MLD youtube video to post.

Gradient compression from the fingers (50% compression in fingers) to the wrist ensures physiological lymph flow. Made from 86% Polyamid (nylon) and 14% Elastan (spandex) in Germany. I like the medi 95 glove, which has full finger compression to the first joint: Medi 95 Glove 20-30mmHg w/Compressive Fingers CCL1=20-30mmHg #760 CCL2=30-40mmHg #761 The Medi 95 glove has compression in the fingers to the first joint. Designed to work in conjunction with the Medi 95 armsleeve, the glove is soft and durable. Just checking on-line, Bandages Plus is so much more expensive than brightlifedirect or nulifemedical.... Tina, I tried on that Medi 550 and shipped it right back. Oh, and Hymil clarified it: III is the size (also known as 3) and 724 is the style, and CCL1 is the compression class.

I had raised this question to both Binney and the head medi rep: when European CCL measurements vary from US, do you go by the absolute compression in mm mercury: in which case CCL2 European=CCL1 US, or does the quality of the fabric make the CCL more accurate than the mm mercury of compression? And, I still don't fully understand the answer. The medi rep told me that any garment manufactured in Europe has to abide by their standards, but that types of fabric will vary and cause different compressions. So, with the armcare being a \"light\" fabric, and the CCL2 is 23/32 mm, which is equivalent to CCL1 in US terms, is this sleeve less compression than your custom medi--which as it's made in Europe, is it also 23/32 mm?

Ms. Shockney (no she is NOT an MD nor a PhD) has posted that no patient at her institution has developed LE after SNB and has advised women that risk reduction guidelines are unnecessary after SNB. So our comments and concerns are accurate. I appreciate your attempt to clarify your statements, but your last line unfortunately was still an admonition for us to get our facts straight. And I realize that many of your friends have LE, but you don't, and it appears that you consider us unfortunate \"lymphers\" to be a group that is clearly separate from you: I don't think it is helpful to make it sound like she has said that there is no or zero risk with an SNB, because that is not accurate and hurts the credibility of those making those kind of statements. Best of luck to you all. While MOTC was too kind in calling us national experts, we do consult national experts in LE, and have about this situation and they have reinforced our concern. It really does help to have the facts and fully understand the situation before you post with unsolicited advice. I have no desire to get into an on-line conflict here, but as I read the passionate and well-reasoned posts of the other women on this thread, and I know how much their help and excellent information and support have helped me, I deeply resent being told that I\"m ill-informed, and making too big of deal about this. And the implication that I shouldn't be questioning Ms. Shockney--Professor of Breast Cancer, without a degree to support that title. At the institution where I teach, with her qualifications, she would be a teaching associate, not a professor--definitely not a full professor. The true national experts have universally welcomed my questions, and just recently we contacted Dr. Howard Levin of Lympha Divas about the need for hand protection, and he immediatly sought the expert advice of Andrea Cheville MD of Mayo Clinic who has written a guideline that helps us all. Dr. Levin's responsiveness and responsible behavior has benefitted all women--both with lymphedema and at risk for it. Kira",

I haven't found much understanding in doctor's offices regarding not having my blood pressure taken in my arms or having blood drawn from the arm. So far, no lymphedema, but how insistent should I be regarding not having the blood pressure taken in the arm or having blood drawn from the arm? I checked with my local insurance covered lab and they can't draw blood from the leg and the medical assistants in local doctor's offices don't know how to do blood pressure in the leg. Thank you for you help. Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/16/2010 sentinel node biopsy was developed to reduce the risk of lymphedema by only removing one node--the sentinel node-- or known also as the guard node. if it is cancer free then no other nodes need to be removed. you probably had sentinel node done on one side with prophylactic mastectomy done on the other side. that said, those who have had axillary node dissections are to not have blood pressures or needle sticks done from the arm where the full ax dissection was performed. most women having sentinel node biopsy and the nodal dissection was limited to that node usually can still have blood pressures and needle sticks from that side. L  5/19/2010 Dear Lillie, I had a single mastectomy and SNB nearly 3 months ago. I have recovered well and aside from some joint pains from Arimidex, have resumed my exercise routine : brisk walking and yoga. We are planning a trip to a famous hotsprings area in northern Japan. In view of lymphedema risks, should I stay away from hot tubs and the like? Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/19/2010 good for you. hot tubs have proven to trigger or at least increase risk of developing lymphedema for women who have had full axillary node dissections. for women who have had only 1 node, the sentinel node removed, no such incidences have been reported that i'm aware of. personally, you need to decide for yourself. if i were going, i'd hop in. an opportunity of a lifetime that carries relatively low risk of causing a problem with only sentinel node having been removed. enjoy your trip! L  Okay, first, most sentinel node biopsies involve more than 1 node. And as our previous thread indicated, the risk is at least 5% for arm LE, higher for breast/trunk LE, and likely the arm LE risk is higher than 5%. How do we stop this expert from dispensing her dangerous medical advice? How do we get her picture off this web site as our expert coach? Her expert medical advice is wrong, and dangerous. You'd think the liability would provoke some oversight--from bc.org and the Johns Hopkins site.

Preoperative assessment enables the early diagnosis and successful treatment of lymphedema. Stout Gergich NL, Pfalzer LA, McGarvey C, Springer B, Gerber LH, Soballe P. Source Breast Cancer Department, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland 20889-5600, USA. nicole.stout@med.navy.mil Abstract BACKGROUND: The incidence of breast cancer (BC)-related lymphedema (LE) ranges from 7% to 47%. Successful management of LE relies on early diagnosis using sensitive measurement techniques. In the current study, the authors demonstrated the effectiveness of a surveillance program that included preoperative limb volume measurement and interval postoperative follow-up to detect and treat subclinical LE. METHODS: LE was identified in 43 of 196 women who participated in a prospective BC morbidity trial. Limb volume was measured preoperatively and at 3-month intervals after surgery. If an increase>3% in upper limb (UL) volume developed compared with the preoperative volume, then a diagnosis of LE was made, and a compression garment intervention was prescribed for 4 weeks. Upon reduction of LE, garment wear was continued only during strenuous activity, with symptoms of heaviness, or with visible swelling. Women returned to the 3-month interval surveillance pathway. Statistical analysis was a repeated-measures analysis of variance by time and limb (PRESULTS: The time to onset of LE averaged 6.9 months postoperatively. The mean (+/-standard deviation) affected limb volume increase was 83 mL (+/-119 mL; 6.5%+/-9.9%) at LE onset (P=.005) compared with baseline. After the intervention, a statistically significant mean 48 mL (+/-103 mL; 4.1%+/-8.8%) volume decrease was realized (P<.0001). The mean duration of the intervention was 4.4 weeks (+/-2.9 weeks). Volume reduction was maintained at an average follow-up of 4.8 months (+/-4.1 months) after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: A short trial of compression garments effectively treated subclinical LE.

Epub 2011 Oct 5. Segmental limb volume change as a predictor of the onset of lymphedema in women with early breast cancer. Stout NL, Pfalzer LA, Levy E, McGarvey C, Springer B, Gerber LH, Soballe P. Source National Naval Medical Center, 8901 Wisconsin Avenue, Breast Care Center Bldg. 19, 3rd floor, Bethesda, MD 20889-5600(\u2020). Abstract OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that segmental changes along the upper extremity occur before the onset of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). These changes may be subclinical in nature and may be predictive of the onset of chronic lymphedema. DESIGN: A retrospective subset analysis of a larger prospective cohort trial. PATIENT COHORT: A total of 196 patients provided consent and were enrolled in the prospective study. Subclinical lymphedema developed in 46 of these patients. Limb volume data were available for 45 of these 46 patients from visits before the onset of lymphedema and were used in this analysis. We compared this group with an age-matched control group without BCRL from the same cohort (n = 45). SETTING: Military hospital outpatient breast care center. METHODS: Women were enrolled and assessed preoperatively. Baseline measures of limb volume were obtained with the use of optoelectronic perometry, and reassessment was conducted at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postoperatively. BCRL was identified in 46 of 196 women at an average of 6.9 months postoperatively. A retrospective analysis was conducted in which we examined volume changes over four 10-cm segments of the limb at the visits before the onset of BCRL. By using repeated-measures multivariate analysis of variance, we compared segmental volumes between groups at preoperative baseline, time of diagnosis of BCRL, and time of follow-up after early intervention. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the strength of the relationship between total limb volume change with segmental volumes at the time of diagnosis of BCRL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: We hypothesized that segmental volume changes occur and can be measured in the limb before the onset of lymphedema. RESULTS: At arm segments 10-20 cm (P = .044) and 20-30 cm (P <.001), a significant volume increase was noted before the diagnosis of subclinical BCRL. Segmental volume changes correlated to the total limb volume (TLV) change. At segments 20-30 cm, the coefficient of determination was r(2) = 0.952, and at 10-20 cm it was r(2) = 0.845, suggesting that these segments predicted TLV changes. CONCLUSION: Serial interval assessment of limb volume segments may be an important clinical tool to detect early-onset lymphedema before TLV changes.

Source Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, A356 Starling-Loving Hall, 320 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. Electra.Paskett@osumc.edu Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors suffer from lymphedema of the arm and/or hand. Accurate estimates of the incidence and prevalence of lymphedema are lacking, as are the effects of this condition on overall quality of life. METHODS: Six hundred twenty-two breast cancer survivors (age, RESULTS: Of those contacted and eligible for the study, 93% agreed to participate. Fifty-four percent reported arm or hand swelling by 36 months after surgery, with 32% reporting persistent swelling. Swelling was reported to occur in the upper arm (43%), the hand only (34%), and both arm and hand (22%). Factors associated with an increased risk of developing swelling included having a greater number of lymph nodes removed [hazards ratio (HR), 1.02; P < 0.01], receiving chemotherapy (HR, 1.76; P = 0.02), being obese (HR, 1.51 versus normal weight; P = 0.01), and being married (HR, 1.36; P = 0.05). Factors associated with persistent swelling were having more lymph nodes removed (odds ratio, 1.03; P = 0.01) and being obese (odds ratio, 2.24 versus normal weight; P < 0.01). Women reporting swelling had significantly lower quality of life as measured by the functional assessment of cancer therapy-breast total score and the SF-12 physical and mental health subscales (P < 0.01 for each). CONCLUSIONS: Lymphedema occurs among a substantial proportion of young breast cancer survivors. Weight management may be a potential intervention for those at greatest risk of lymphedema to maintain optimal health-related quality of life among survivors.",

There was no history of trauma. Eleven months earlier, she had undergone a wide local excision with axillary lymph-node dissection for an invasive ductal carcinoma (T2N0, 2.5 cm in diameter) of the ipsilateral breast. The postoperative course was uneventful, and she did not receive perioperative antibiotics. Surgery was followed by six courses of chemotherapy and 50 Gy of radiotherapy on the right breast. Examination of the breast revealed erythema, tenderness, and warmth, none of which crossed the midline, but no masses or lymphedema was palpable. The white-cell count was 13,300 per cubic millimeter. Ultrasonography showed no evidence of a soft-tissue abscess. The diagnosis of cellulitis was made, and the patient received oral antibiotics, with complete resolution of symptoms. A follow-up mammogram 6 weeks later showed no evidence of recurrent cancer. ",

It really stinks that you don't have access to a good LE therapist, because it's so necessary.  JoAnn Rovig sells a DVD--it's old, but it's about self care of the arm. It's a basic overview, I'd watch her on-line videos first and consider the DVD www.nwlymphedemacenter.org/pat... Kira",

When you get your next compression garments, have the fitter consider garments that can fit the biggest \"range\"--as some have little leeway and others--like Jobst--run small/med/large and one garment fits a huge range of sizes. Hang in there. I may wrap at night, but I don't try and function during the day with one. It's hard. Kira",

      "Content": "Aug 10, 2010 01:58AM - edited Aug 10, 2010 02:00AM by kira Suzy, please eat your tomatoes! I'll read the nutrition article again, but if you love them, then screw the thought that they're not good for you--they're full of good stuff. You NEVER have to put on the happy face for us. Ever. You are adored because of your spirit and honesty, and honestly this stinks! I babble constantly when I'm having a session with my LE therapist, and I adore her, but when it comes time to measure me: I'm filled with dread. Of course you're going to swell when infected--and nothing brings on inflammation more than an infection. Please, get your hair done, get some cowboy boots and never, ever feel that you need to apologize for getting disgusted with LE. I recently sent a fellow LE sister a favorite quote: from 30 years ago in grad school when we had note taking services (pre-computers) and would xerox our notes, and add quotes: Elvis Costello, from \"Red Shoes\" \"Oh, I used to be disgusted, now I try and be amused.\" Here is a favorite posting of mine about positive attitude, and personally I appreciated \"Bright Sided by Barbara Eirenricht\" and I can link her \"Welcome to Cancerland\" article as well. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc/fears/ask_expert/2002_06/question_04.jsp I know this about attitude and recurrence fear, but it applies to LE, IMO: eebird: Can you cause your cancer to come back just by being afraid that it will? Answer -Rosalind Kleban, L.C.S.W.: I am glad that this question was raised, because I'm sure that is on the mind of the majority of people. It is a very popular notion in our culture today that if you have a positive attitude you can get rid of your cancer, or that you never get it or that it doesn't return. If you think about it, that notion is truly an oxymoron. An oxymoron means two things that don't go together-like \"jumbo shrimp.\" The reason I call it that is to think about telling somebody what is the worst news of his or her lifetime and then ask them to be positive just doesn't make sense. Having bad feelings and down days is neither good nor bad-it's just normal. The only people we ask to have a positive attitude at all times are people who have had cancer. I can be miserable all day long and nobody is going to reprimand me about being positive. You only 'have' to be positive if you have cancer. Having that philosophy or notion or belief is like living in tyranny. What it does to you as a patient is that on days that you are down or depressed or sad or anxious or worried-which is normal-you will feel even worse because you have accepted the notion that those are bad feelings. You need to work hard to get rid of that notion. It is not fair. It is putting a burden on the patient, while it serves many good purposes for the people who are saying it. If you are going to be happy and positive all of the time, then I don't have to worry about you. It also leads me to believe that if I am positive I will be fine. The philosophy serves everyone except the patient. You need to know that people will tell you that you need to be positive. You need to be prepared in how to handle that comment coming at you, and that is something that you want to do in a way that is comfortable for you. What I think works is that when someone tells you to be positive, suggest they walk in your shoes first. And inform them that when people speak to you that way, it's really not helpful. You need to protect yourself as much as possible from that theory because it is burdensome and hurtful. A bad attitude will cause only one thing and that is a bad day. The best reason for having a good attitude is that on that day you will enjoy yourself. But neither the good nor the bad attitude will affect the illness. It will affect the quality of the day that you are having. Your fear is just the natural outcome of having this diagnosis. It will not cause the cancer to come back. I work with a thousand women a year and I have never met one that doesn't suffer from fear, either enormous or very enormous. It's normal. Not bad, just normal. It will have no impact on the course of the cancer. Here's the link to \"Welcome to Cancerland\": in Bright-Sided she equated the demand that we have a positive attitude to a lack of empathy. www.barbaraehrenreich.com/canc... And last, remember the Binney/Kira theory (unproven but firmly believed) that flares cause despair--it's part of the process and fairly universal. Hang in there, and realize that you have unconditional support here, and are adored for who you are. Kira",

On advice of my therapist, I went back to wrapping--but I find I'm just not that good at it, and it left my hand worse. I do have a day glove--a medi 95--the juzo didn't work for me, and I have a custom elvarex which is back at the company for some re-working.   My LE therapist recommended a gauze hand wrap when my fingers swell. It can be helpful.   I do MLD at least twice a day, and combine the sweeping techniques from the Northwest Lymphedema center videos, with the stationary circles that my therapist prefers.   Recently, I had to fight to get a referral to an OT/hand therapist--my LE therapist, an LMT, is kind of backing out of practice--and the argument I got from the head of the clinic (and I have a referral) is that \"I've already done so much.\" So frustrating. Solaris makes a glove for night time use and jovi makes an open fingered glove as well. I've only ever had swelling in my hand--from a week after surgery, with axillary web and a bug bit on my wrist--and it just hangs in there. The back of the hand is better, but it found my finger and palm. I get those pockets between the web spaces as well. I was at a tai chi class, and sat next to a former classmate who is a breast surgeon, and told her about the LE after just 3 nodes, and she said \"It happens, commonly.\" She recommended the clinic that I had to fight to get into. She advised that I wear a sleeve as well in class, because she said that even though my arm never has swollen, the blockage is higher up. (I haven't tried it yet.) Solaris makes dorsal swell spots--I have one, but don't really use it, because I have the jovi pak. Kira ",

I alternate them for comfort and the shorter glove is easier to get off and as it's less expensive and I have some old one's, I'll use it if there's a chance I might mess it up.

However, if you have not really improved, then it's worth a consideration of a switch. The blisters are concerning to me--usually they're part of a strep infection, but they do indicate a skin breakdown. I'd strongly recommend going back to the doctor and considering 1) another 7-10 days of amov/clav or 2) another 10 days of the sulfatrim and penicillin--discuss how it's going with them. With LE, we have an impaired immune response and we don't clear the infection, so it needs to be treated QUICKLY, and until it's completely gone. Let me know how it works out. Cellulitis rots. And there's this movement against antibiotics, but we sure do need them. Kira",

A TENS just shoots electrical pulses and makes the muscle jump. I see no reason, other than if it causes pain, that you can't use it upstream from your LE hand. I broke my LE hand a couple of years ago, and got a partially frozen shoulder due to immobilization: I was treated for it by PT with myofascial release and exercises, and no negative effects on my LE hand/forearm. Now the fracture did me no favors, but that's another story, and it seems back to baseline. My daughter bought one of those home TENS and I helped her try it out the other day, and I can't see the harm, other than reaction to adhesive for the pads. I say, no expert here, try it and see if it helps, and if it makes the LE flare. It's easily enough to try and observe and see what benefits and/or draw backs you get. Kira",

Your onc completely misunderstood the Katie Schmitz presentation about strength training protecting against lymphedema--she has also studied women with lymphedema, and they could ONLY do strength training when they were completely stable--no need to see a LE therapist for 4 months or more--and had custom garmets to wear while weight lifting--and still some women flared. Weight lifting DOES NOT CURE OR TREAT LYMPHEDEMA--strengthening--when done by the PAL protocol can fairly safely strenghten arms and prevent some lymphedema and if women have lymphedema, they tend to flare less with a strengthened arm. Your onc's response is exactly what we were afraid of when the \"Weight lifting slashes lymphedema risk\" headlines came out. You have lyphedema--and I'm really sorry--but the good news is that you caught it early and and can get early treatment, and get it under control. If your compression sleeve and gauntlet are well fitted, you can consider wearing in while waiting, --the best bet is to get a referral to a qualified lymphedema therapist. There was a study where they put women in sleeves with early LE--but only under careful supervision, and it helped. Here are hints on what to do while waiting: There are links in the web page http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#while%20waiting What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled. Call your onc back and get a referral, and let us know how you do. Sorry if this comes off as a rant, but the last study she published iin 2009 was SO misunderstood that she helpfully wrote clarifications on the NLN site: www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... Perhaps you'd like to share them with your oncologist. Kira",

I'd be a bit concerned about flying with a new glove--it sounds great, but who knows if it chafes or gets uncomfortable. The NLN re-did their flying recommendations: And reading it--and this always gets to Binney--these position papers are supposed to be written for patients--sure reads like written for health care professionals--looks like it's your choice. My LE therapist recommends bandaging, but maybe bring both. It didn't copy well, here's the link www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... TOPIC: AIR TRAVEL Air travel presents several considerations for individuals with lymphedema and for those at risk for lymphedema. It is the position of the National Lymphedema Network that: 􀂙 Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of lymphedema should wear some form of compressiontherapy while traveling by air. 􀂙 Individuals at risk for developing lymphedema should understand the risk factors associated withair travel and should make a decision to wear compression based on their individual risk factors. Rationale for the Use of Compression The cabin pressure that is experienced during air flight is less than the atmospheric pressure on the ground.During flight, cabin pressure decreases from sea level to the low air pressure found at between 6,000 and8,000 feet above sea level. The decreased pressure within the plane\u2019s cabin may give rise to increasedswelling in a lymphedematous limb as tissue pressures are physiologically altered. (1; 2) Changes in fluidproduction in the tissues occur when the external pressures exerted on the limb are changed. (3) Diminished pressure in the airplane cabin will result in a decrease in the fluid moved in to the lymphatic system. The fluid will remain in the extracellular spaces and an exacerbation of lymphedema may result. (4) The use ofthe compression garments will provide external pressure on the extremity to adequately support favorableresorption and decrease the potential for fluid accumulation in the tissue. (5) The use of compression may prevent worsening of pre-existing lymphedema and is recommended for those with lymphedema during airtravel. (6) Compression bandages will potentially increase the interstitial tissue pressure and enhance themuscle pump in the lymphedematous extremity. The beneficial outcomes are two-fold. First, resorption offluid at the capillary level is enhanced due to the compression. (Written at the patient level, right???) Second, the garment or bandages stimulatet he lymphatic system, via the muscle pump, and uptake of extracellular fluid increases, helping to prevent an exacerbation of lymphedema. Definition of Individuals At-Risk for Lymphedema People at risk for lymphedema are individuals who have NOT yet displayed signs and symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of lymphedema but have a known insufficiency of their lymphatic system. This includes people who have undergone removal of lymph nodes or radiation therapy, which increases the risk fordeveloping lymphedema. At-risk individuals have altered lymphatic function that may impede the body\u2019sability to take up excess fluids that escape into the tissues. Individuals at risk should pay close attention tochanges in sensations of their extremities, such as heaviness, fullness of aching that may signal the onset oflymphedema from an airline flight. People who are at risk for lymphedema should take precautions when flying and should consider compression to the affected limb. A medical compression garment should be recommended and sized by ahealth care practitioner who is experienced in garment fitting. Other Considerations for Air Travel In addition to alterations in air pressure, several other factors may contribute to an exacerbation of lymphedema during travel. Air travel is sedentary in nature, which causes blood and lymphatic circulation to slow. This may precipitate an exacerbation of swelling as fluid pools in a dependent extremity. All individuals traveling by plane are advised to move their limbs frequently to help prevent swelling. Standing and moving around the cabin frequently will encourage improved uptake of extracellular fluid and help prevent further accumulation of fluid in the tissues. Lifting and carrying heavy luggage may cause stress on muscles in an involved or high-risk limb, increasing the risk of swelling. Bags with shoulder straps can cut across lymphatics in an upper extremityincreasing the risk to an affected arm. Using roller bags or having assistance with bags is stronglyencouraged. Another factor influencing fluid dynamics in an extremity is dehydration during travel. (8) Ambient air inthe passenger cabin of a plane is dry and may increase the potential for dehydration. Without adequate fluidintake the blood capillary pressures may alter. Dehydration of the lymphedematous limb may increaseprotein concentration in the tissues resulting in increased ultrafiltration of fluid from the blood into the extracellular spaces and potentially contributing further to swelling in the affected limb. Based on the risks described above, the National Lymphedema Network offers the following guidelines for air travel: For Individuals With A Confirmed Lymphedema Diagnosis Regarding Compression Garments, persons with lymphedema should: 􀂙 Obtain a well-fitted compression garment for air travel. 􀂙 Obtain the garment well in advance of the trip and wear it several times to ensure proper fit and comfort. 􀂙 For most upper extremity lymphedema conditions compression of at lease 20-30 mmHg is recommended. 􀂙 For most lower extremity lymphedema conditions, compression of at least 30-40mmHg is recommended. 􀂙 A hand piece, either a glove or a gauntlet should be worn with the compression sleeve. 􀂙 Place the garment on before take-off. 􀂙 Leave garment on for 1-3 hours after deplaning to allow tissue pressures to equilibrate. Regarding Compression Bandages During air travel, certain individuals may require the added compression afforded by bandaging. These persons should: 􀂙 Be trained by a lymphedema specialist in appropriate bandaging techniques. 􀂙 Apply the compression bandages before flying. 􀂙 Leave the bandages on until you reach your final destination. 􀂙 While away from home, continue your regular schedule of garment and bandage wear. For Individuals at Risk for Lymphedema Each person must make an individual choice based on risk factors associated with their own medical history. The NLN recommends that at-risk individuals make an informed decision in conjunction with their health care provider. If an individual choose to obtain a compression garment, follow therecommendations as above. For All Individuals Traveling Regarding seat Assignment, Airport Regulations and Airline Choice: 􀂙 Persons with lower extremity lymphedema should consider a seat with increased leg room, such asa bulk-head or first class seat if possible. 􀂙 A note from your physician regarding your lymphedema may help answer security questions related to your bandages or compression garments. 􀂙 Newer jetliners such as Air Bus, A380 or Boeing Dreamliners are able to maintain higher cabin pressure with more humidified air, and may improve comfort. NLN Position Paper: Air Travel Page 3 of 4 Regarding Activity 􀂙 Avoid carrying heavy bags or using shoulder straps on the affected arm. 􀂙 Use roller bags or obtain assistance for carrying, lifting and transporting luggage. 􀂙 Wear loose fitting, non-constricting clothing. 􀂙 Move about the cabin frequently if possible to enhance contribution of the \u201cmuscle pump\u201d. 􀂙 Throughout your trip, try to avoid excessive activities of the type that tend to exacerbate your swelling, take frequent breaks for rest and elevation, and get adequate sleep. Regarding Dietary and Medical Concerns for Individuals with Lymphedema and Those At Risk 􀂙 Ensure adequate fluid intake during flight and throughout your trip. 􀂙 Maintain healthy eating habits, minimizing alcohol, caffeine and salty foods. 􀂙 Consider bringing antibiotics with you, especially when travelling outside the U.S. or if you have a history of cellulitis in the affected limb. 􀂙 Wear a LYMPHEDEMA ALERT Bracelet (upper extremity) and/or necklace (lower extremity). Note: The aforementioned recommendations are to serve as guidelines and cannot guarantee the prevention of Lymphedema in those at-risk, or worsening of Lymphedema in those with swelling. Each person\u2019s medical status may affect their response to air travel. Consultation with a physician and/or a Lymphedema therapist prior to travel may be beneficial. Kira",

Predicting breast cancer-related lymphedema using self-reported symptoms. Armer JM, Radina ME, Porock D, Culbertson SD. Source Sinclair School of Nursing, Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, University of Missouri-Columbia, 65211, USA. armer@missouri.edu Abstract OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the accuracy of using self-reported signs and symptoms to identify the presence of lymphedema as well as the usefulness of identifying clinically measurable lymphedema on the basis of certain symptoms elicited by the Lymphedema Breast Cancer Questionnaire (LBCQ). METHODS: This analysis used logistic regression to identify symptoms predictive of differences between symptom experiences of participants belonging to two distinct groups (study A): those with known post-breast cancer lymphedema (n = 40) and those in a control group of women with no history of breast cancer or lymphedema (n = 40). Symptoms in this model of best fit were used to examine their relation to limb circumferences of breast cancer survivors in a second independent data set (study B; n = 103) in which a diagnosis of known lymphedema was not previously determined using symptom experiences. RESULTS: The presence of lymphedema was predicted by three symptoms comprising a model of best fit for study A (c =.952): \"heaviness in past year,\" \"swelling now,\" and \"numbness in past year.\" Using this model, prediction of absolute maximal circumferential limb difference (i.e., >or=2 cm) in study B showed that \"heaviness in the past year\" (p =.0279) and \"swelling now\" (p =.0007) were predictive. \"Numbness in the past year\" was not predictive. However, those with lesser limb differences reported this symptom more often. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that changes in sensations may be indicators of early lymphedema or other treatment-related sequelae that must be assessed carefully at each follow-up visit and over time. A combination of symptom assessment and limb volume measurement may provide the best clinical assessment data for identifying changes associated with post-breast cancer lymphedema.

I have also not had good luck with Jovipak and wrap at night, and since my LE is primarily in my hand and forearm, I tend to find with compression that \"less is more\"--gloves will often trap fluid in my hand. Before the fracture, I would take off the glove and wiggle my fingers, and the trapped fluid would leave. Now, I wear the gloves most of the time, but still try and move my fingers as much as possible and take some compression breaks. And I made new foam \"carrots\" for my wrapping, for the MCP spaces. At one point, NatsFan sent me this amazing excel program her husband created that allows you to track your measurements and it totals them for volume changes--if you pm her, I think she'll send it. The whole trigger issue, leading to permanent changes always amazes me: although I suppose there was subclinical lymphatic dysfunction and the step class just tipped the scales. I got bug bites, and the hand swelling never went away. It's part of why the slow resolution of my hand swelling after the fracture upsets me, because the fracture was a direct insult to my lymphatic system--and may leave me with a \"new normal\" I have used a brusque but good fitter who does all the work for the big teaching hospitals in Boston, and she firmly believes that with hand swelling \"less is more\". You got to get trained by the Casley-Smiths--wow!  Every thing you wrote just made so much sense--I hope the wrapping and foam break up the fibrosis and the lighter compression lets all the fluid flow up and out.

D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; Mayo Clinic Rochester, Rochester, MN Abstract: Background: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) eliminates the need for axillary dissection (ALND) in patients whose sentinel node (SN) is tumor-free. However, completion ALND remains the gold standard for patients with a tumor-involved sentinel node. ALND achieves regional control, but its effect on survival remains controversial. The main objective of ACOSOG Z0011 was to compare outcomes of patients with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) detected metastasis in SN managed with or without ALND and no axillary irradiation. Methods: Clinically node-negative patients who underwent SN biopsy and had 1 or 2 SN with metastases detected by H&E were randomized to ALND or no further axillary specific treatment. All patients were treated with lumpectomy and opposing tangential field irradiation. Adjuvant systemic therapy was at the discretion of their physicians. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and locoregional control were evaluated. Results: 446 patients were randomized to SNB alone and 445 to SNB plus ALND. Patients treated with SNB alone were similar to those treated with SNB + ALND with respect to age, tumor size, Bloom-Richardson score, estrogen receptor status, adjuvant systemic therapy, tumor type, and T stage. Patients randomized to SNB alone had a median of two lymph nodes removed whereas patients randomized to ALND had a median of 17 lymph nodes removed. 17.6% of ALND patients had 3 or more involved nodes compared to 5.0% of SNB patients (p < 0.001). Median follow-up is 6.2 years. 5-year in breast recurrence after ALND was 3.7% compared to 2.1% for SNB (p = 0.16) while 5-year nodal recurrence was 0.6% compared to 1.3% (p = 0.44) respectively. The five-year OS for patients undergoing SNB + ALND is 91.9% compared to 92.5% for SNB alone (p = 0.24), and DFS is 82.2% compared to 83.8% respectively (p = 0.13). Conclusions: Despite the widely held belief that ALND improves survival, no significant difference was recognized by this study of SN node-positive women. Although the study closed early because of low accrual/event rate, it is the largest phase III study of ALND for node-positive women, and it demonstrates no trend toward clinical benefit of ALND for patients with limited nodal disease. This is one study, and you can discuss it with your treating physicians--they need to interpret the study WITH the knowledge of your specific situation. Recovery from axillary lymph node dissection involves a drain usually, and there may be soreness and some numbness in the area. Yes, there is a higher risk of lymphedema--but I got lymphedema after a sentinel node biopsy. There are a lot of studies that show that pre-operative assessment by a qualified lymphedema therapist and early post-op treatment can help prevent lymphedema--especially with ALND. There was a study in BMJ that showed early lymphedema therapy prevented lymphedema. Here's how to find a qualified lymphedema therapist: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... We can offer support and information, but you need to discuss treatment with your treating physicians, and you do have a right to question them as to the reasoning behind their recommendations. Good luck, hope all goes well.  And yes, those of us with lymphedema aren't happy to have it, but we're over on the lymphedema thread sharing information and encouragement, and occasional frustration.

So, I worry when I see that 70% reduction, without further explanation, in this document. In her case, weight lifting triggered LE. And I met with her for an hour to try and help her figure out how to go forward. So, I read this and thought it was great, but Binney read it closer and raised those two concerns.

And she had a case of lymphedema occur after popping cords, so if a cord pops while gentle stretch is applied, that's fine, but don't go after them. Cording is a risk for LE, as the vessels carry lymph and are damaged. Here is the page on SUSO on AWS--sometimes the chest cords are called Mondor's Syndrome, which is more veins than lymph, but I think they're all the same thing: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm The stretches help, and cording does get better on it's own, although all the cords don't necessarily go away.

Possibly fluid was getting trapped at the wrist. We all find what works for us, but often it's not before we waste a lot of time and money and have a drawer/closet full of expensive things that don't work.

Wear the compression that feels comfortable, and manages your swelling. for me, night time wrapping is the key, and then I get away with much less daytime compression.

So, if you can pioneer a surgery, and with this degree of microsurgery and sophistication, I'm sure the reimbursement is relatively high, surgeons will try it. There is no legal standard for only doing effective and safe surgery--medical standards of care evolve as data is published. I hate to be entirely cynical here: but medicine is a business--in the fee for service model in the US--and I don't want to see women harmed. As I've said before, we deserve better. Glad there's some interest, too bad someone is making a profit of it, and the data is tiny and doesn't show a great benefit (for the risk.)--IMO.

Here are two recent \"expert advice answers\" http://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/viewquestions.asp?id=999805493 www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/se...  Asked Publicly Submitted Question 5/15/2010 I've had bilateral mastectomys and sentinel lymph node dissections. I haven't found much understanding in doctor's offices regarding not having my blood pressure taken in my arms or having blood drawn from the arm. So far, no lymphedema, but how insistent should I be regarding not having the blood pressure taken in the arm or having blood drawn from the arm? I checked with my local insurance covered lab and they can't draw blood from the leg and the medical assistants in local doctor's offices don't know how to do blood pressure in the leg. Thank you for you help. Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/16/2010 sentinel node biopsy was developed to reduce the risk of lymphedema by only removing one node--the sentinel node-- or known also as the guard node. if it is cancer free then no other nodes need to be removed. you probably had sentinel node done on one side with prophylactic mastectomy done on the other side. that said, those who have had axillary node dissections are to not have blood pressures or needle sticks done from the arm where the full ax dissection was performed. most women having sentinel node biopsy and the nodal dissection was limited to that node usually can still have blood pressures and needle sticks from that side. L  5/19/2010 Dear Lillie, I had a single mastectomy and SNB nearly 3 months ago. I have recovered well and aside from some joint pains from Arimidex, have resumed my exercise routine : brisk walking and yoga. We are planning a trip to a famous hotsprings area in northern Japan. In view of lymphedema risks, should I stay away from hot tubs and the like? Replied JHU's Breast Center Reply 5/19/2010 good for you. hot tubs have proven to trigger or at least increase risk of developing lymphedema for women who have had full axillary node dissections. for women who have had only 1 node, the sentinel node removed, no such incidences have been reported that i'm aware of. personally, you need to decide for yourself. if i were going, i'd hop in. an opportunity of a lifetime that carries relatively low risk of causing a problem with only sentinel node having been removed. enjoy your trip! L  Okay, first, most sentinel node biopsies involve more than 1 node. And as our previous thread indicated, the risk is at least 5% for arm LE, higher for breast/trunk LE, and likely the arm LE risk is higher than 5%. How do we stop this expert from dispensing her dangerous medical advice? How do we get her picture off this web site as our expert coach? Her expert medical advice is wrong, and dangerous. You'd think the liability would provoke some oversight--from bc.org and the Johns Hopkins site.

Our stories would be very helpful iin educating women at risk, and their providers, about lymphedema. I agree with Binney and everyone who posted that I really hope bc.org utilizes experts in lymphology when they re-write their content on lymphedema. And that \"experts\" who offer medical advice, that can have life long consequences, need to fully understand the subject, and while personal experience is powerful, it does not represent universal facts.   Electra Paskett PhD, researcher and woman with LE has said that lymphedema is understudied: Here's the abstract from her 2008 article in the Journal \"Breast\" :Lymphedema: Knowledge, Treatment, and Impact Among Breast Cancer Survivors Electra D. Paskett, PhD and Nancy Stark, RN, PhD Department of Public Health Sciences, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, North Carolina Address correspondence and reprint requests to: Electra D.

It is estimated that as many as 60% of breast cancer survivors report symptoms of lymphedema. Few studies have examined the impact of lymphedema on the lives of women with breast cancer. The goal of this pilot study was to identify knowledge about, treatment received for, and the effect of lymphedema among a group of breast cancer survivors and physicians. Forty women with lymphedema and 10 physicians who treat breast cancer patients participated. Overall, women knew little to nothing about lymphedema before they developed it. After diagnosis, the primary source of information about lymphedema was a doctor or physical therapist. The majority of women received compressive garment therapy (75%), 46.9% received mechanical compressive therapy, 26% received bandaging, and 22% received physical therapy. More than half (55%) reported that clothing and appearance were affected by their condition and 48% reported that routine daily activities were impaired. Hot weather (58%) and regular arm use (40%) were reported to exacerbate the swelling. Most physicians reported that they did not routinely counsel women or provide written information on lymphedema prevention to their patients, and the extent to which women's daily living was affected by the condition was not always recognized. These findings have implications for interventions aimed at educating women and providers about lymphedema. www3.interscience.wiley.com/jo... We are a powerful resource, and we are all experts of our own experience and as a group we are looking for accurate information. We value quality of life, that's why we want to reduce the risk both to ourselves and every other person who is at risk, of getting lymphedema. We want everyone to know how to reduce that risk and to then use their personal judgement, AFTER they're fully and accurately informed. Kira",

Because they inject the breast with nuclear dye and often with blue dye, the nodes that immediately drain the breast light up--and it's usually 1-3. Otter's surgeon told her the usual number she took is three. The false negative rate on SNB is low, but they do want to take all the \"hot\" nodes--it may be just one, but it's usually a couple at least. With SNB there has been an increase in breast and chest LE, while likely there is a decrease in arm LE--yet we don't know a \"real\" number, because there is no one definition of LE, so it's comparing apples and oranges. That's why the rates vary between 5-41%, because it all depends on how you measure it. This recent study defined it as TWO arm measurements--one on the upper and one on the lower arm, done TWICE--once before surgery and one time several years later. They agreed that their method was flawed--most LE therapists measure the hand and entire arm at 4 cm intervals, and when Jane Armer does that with the 250 women she follows closely, at any one time, 91% of women have at least one measurement that is 2 cm larger than the other arm. Here's the study: Ann Surg Oncol. 2010 Jun 24. [Epub ahead of print] Morbidity of Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: The Relationship Between the Number of Excised Lymph Nodes and Lymphedema. Goldberg JI, Wiechmann LI, Riedel ER, Morrow M, Van Zee KJ. Breast Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. Abstract BACKGROUND: Despite the reduced morbidity associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), lymphedema remains a clinically relevant complication. We hypothesized that a higher number of lymph nodes (LNs) removed during SLNB is associated with a higher risk of lymphedema. METHODS: Six hundred patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLNB were prospectively studied. Circumferential bilateral upper extremity measurements were performed preoperatively and at 3-8 years after surgery. Association of lymphedema with total number of LNs excised and other clinicopathologic variables was analyzed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient, Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and logistic regression. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 5 years, 5% of patients had developed lymphedema. Factors associated with lymphedema included weight and body mass index. There was no association between the number of LNs removed and the change in upper extremity measurements or in the incidence of lymphedema. Among patients with lymphedema (n = 31) compared to those without, the mean (3.9 vs. 4.2), median (4 vs. 3), and range (1-9 vs. 1-17) of number of LNs removed were similar (P = 0.93). Among the 33 women with >/=10 LNs removed, none developed lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of 600 women who underwent SLNB, there is no correlation between number of LNs removed and change in upper extremity circumference or incidence of lymphedema. These data suggest that other factors, such as the global disruption of the lymphatic channels during axillary lymph node dissection, play a larger role in development of lymphedema than does the number of LNs removed Their actual conclusion about the global disruption of the lymphatic channels and LE is interesting, but the two point, two time measurements is VERY Insensitive--I don't have LE. So, SNB removed the draining node(s) from the breast, and the incidence of LE afterward is just not known because we don't have one diagnostic criteria for it, but it is real, and to tell women they're at no risk and that lymphedema risk reduction guidelines are never needed is dangerous and innacurate advice.

Epub 2009 Apr 26. Surgical resection of the primary tumour is associated with improved survival in patients with distant metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis. Ruiterkamp J, Ernst MF, van de Poll-Franse LV, Bosscha K, Tjan-Heijnen VC, Voogd AC. Department of Surgery, Jeroen Bosch Hospital, PO Box 90153, 5200 ME 's-Hertogenbosch, The Netherlands. j.ruiterkamp@jbz.nl Abstract OBJECTIVE: Recent studies indicate that removal of the primary tumour may have a beneficial effect on mortality risk of patients with primary distant metastatic breast cancer (stage IV), although most of them did not rule out confounding by the presence of co-morbidity. In this retrospective study the impact of surgical resection of the primary tumour on the survival of patients with primary distant metastatic disease is investigated, taking into account the presence of co-morbidity and other potential confounders. METHODS: Between 1993 and 2004, 15 769 patients with breast cancer were diagnosed in the south of the Netherlands. This study included the 728 patients with distant metastatic disease at initial presentation, which was 5% of all patients. Of them, 40% had surgery of the primary tumour. Follow-up was carried out until 1 July 2006. RESULTS: Median survival of the patients who had surgery of their primary tumour was significantly longer than for the patients who did not have surgery (31 vs. 14 months). The 5-year survival rates were 24.5% and 13.1%, respectively (p < 0.0001). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, period of diagnosis, T-classification, number of metastatic sites, co-morbidity, use of loco-regional radiotherapy and use of systemic therapy, surgery appeared to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (HR = 0.62; 95% CI 0.51-0.76). CONCLUSION: Removal of the primary tumour in patients with primary distant metastatic disease was associated with a reduction of the mortality risk of around 40%. The association was independent of age, presence of co-morbidity and other potential confounders, but a randomized controlled trial will be needed to rule out residual confounding. Now, I haven't really researched the controversy about ALND vs. SNB, but here's a quick pub med search result www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19... Br J Surg. 2009 Jan;96(1):40-6. Axelsson CK, Düring M, Christiansen PM, Wamberg PA, Søe KL, Møller S; Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group Surgical Study Group. Department F of Breast Surgery, Herlev University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. cax@dadlnet.dk BACKGROUND: This study examined whether axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with removal of many normal lymph nodes resulted in a reduced rate of axillary recurrence and better survival, as reported in recent studies. METHODS: The follow-up analyses were based on 8657 patients with node-negative primary breast cancer treated solely by surgery. Median follow-up was 9 years. RESULTS: The number of lymph nodes removed correlated with a reduction in the rate of subsequent axillary recurrence (from 2.1 to 0.4 per cent; P = 0.037), local recurrence (from 7.4 to 3.8 per cent; P < 0.001) distant metastases (from 15.0 to 10.3 per cent; P < 0.001) and death as first event (from 7.5 to 5.5 per cent; P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: When ALND is indicated, at least ten axillary lymph nodes should be retrieved. The role of ALND as primary treatment has decreased significantly during the past decade. The findings leave the concept of the sentinel node biopsy intact, as a highly specific procedure compared to ALND. Copyright (c) 2008 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

Comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and completion axillary lymph node dissection for node-positive breast cancer. Bilimoria KY, Bentrem DJ, Hansen NM, Bethke KP, Rademaker AW, Ko CY, Winchester DP, Winchester DJ. Cancer Programs, American College of Surgeons, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. Abstract PURPOSE: For women with breast cancer, the role of completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after identification of nodal metastases by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been questioned. Our objectives were to assess national nodal evaluation practice patterns and to examine differences in recurrence and survival for SLNB alone versus SLNB with completion ALND. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the National Cancer Data Base (1998 to 2005), women with clinically node-negative breast cancer who underwent SLNB and who had nodal metastases were identified. Practice patterns and outcomes were examined for patients who underwent SLNB alone versus SLNB with completion ALND (median follow-up, 63 months). RESULTS: Of 97,314 patients, 20.8% underwent SLNB alone, and 79.2% underwent SLNB with completion ALND. In 2004 to 2005, patients were significantly more likely to undergo SLNB alone if they were older, had smaller tumors, or were treated at non-National Cancer Institute-designated cancer centers. In patients with macroscopic nodal metastases (n = 20,075 during 1998 to 2000), there was a nonsignificant trend toward better outcomes for completion ALND (v SLNB alone) after analysis was adjusted for differences between the two groups: axillary recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.06) and overall survival (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.04). In patients with microscopic nodal metastases (n = 2,203 during 1998 to 2000), there were no significant differences in axillary recurrence or survival for patients who underwent SLNB alone versus completion ALND. CONCLUSION: Compared with SLNB alone, completion ALND does not appear to improve outcomes for breast cancer patients with microscopic nodal metastases; however, there was a nonsignificant trend toward better outcomes with completion ALND for those with macroscopic disease. I'll do more research on it, but I suport LindaLou's approach to removing all the macroscopically involved nodes, and I know when we read path reports and see extracapsular extension, it's considered a very negative sign.

While Mayo has set up satellites to capture the wealthy retiree market, Hopkins has my former neighbor arrange transportation, accommodations, etc.  There are patient oriented sites, and there are marketing sites, and the Hopkins site is a marketing site, masquerading as patient education--misleading and unethical, IMO And, bc.org has never gotten around to updating their LE pages--way too busy pushing organic food.....

And I\"m not that hard to please! As one of the heads of a major training school said: \"I can train them, but can't supervise them out in the community.\"  My LE therapist is a LMT (massage therapist) that I pay out of pocket, but is worth it. It's unfortunate that this woman doesn't understand truncal LE--it does sound like she would do MLD to reduce the swelliing, but if she's going to deny your reality and mis-diagnose you over the phone, it sounds like she's not the one for you. I hate to hear that you have to travel long distances, but if you find someone good, it makes all the difference. Binney's initial therapist--LANA certified--made her LE spread. KMMD just got a new person who is so much better. Unfortunately, most LE therapists work without any real physician supervision, and their quality and knowledge is variable. Not to add the constraints of insurance--she's probably hung up on documenting LE to get reimbursed, and it's the stupid \"2 cm rule\"--if one arm is 2 cm larger it's considered LE--on absolutely no scientific evidence, but it's become the gold standard, because it's easy. Luckily, I found my LMT rather quickly, but she wanted a PT involved because I had cords, and then I saw a whole bunch of them. The final one was okay, but kind of rigid. Five--it was horrible. And one was at a major Harvard teaching hospital, and started out good, and then things got weird. Hang in there. Kira",

Another Viewpoint Joshua Fosnot, MD, Shareef Jandali, MD, John P. Fischer, MD, Liza C. Wu, MD, Joseph M. Serletti, MD. The University of Pennsylvania Health System, Philadelphia, PA, USA. BACKGROUND: Lymphedema is a well documented complication of treatment for breast cancer. A recent retrospective report concluded new onset lymphedema was rare following delayed reconstruction and may decrease its severity in preexisting disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the patient's perspective. METHODS: The design of this study was a retrospective review of delayed unilateral breast reconstruction performed by the senior authors between 2005 and 2009 combined with the use of a well validated survey instrument which can be used to diagnose lymphedema. Patients were mailed a series of questions to determine if they had lymphedema. In addition, they were asked separate questions about reconstruction's effect on arm symptoms. RESULTS: During this time period, 90 patients underwent delayed unilateral breast reconstruction with an autologous free flap. After two mailings, 66.6% (n=60) of patients returned the survey and were included in data analysis. Of the 60 respondents, 10.0% (n=6) had been diagnosed and documented as having lymphedema in the medical record. In evaluating the recent report on lymphedema, the prevalence of lymphedema in their patient population was 7.9%. These are in stark contrast to the survey which reported 48.3% (n=29) with lymphedema (p=0.01) which is more consistent with previous reports of lymphedema following mastectomy. Overall, 28.3% (n=17) reported mild lymphedema and 20.0% (n=12) reported moderate/severe lymphedema. Of those diagnosed by survey, 51.7% thought there was no change, 27.6% were worse, 20.7% were better following reconstruction. Although not necessarily indicative of a diagnosis of lymphedema, when asked questions about arm symptoms 38.4% thought their symptoms were worse, 30.8% reported no change and 30.8% stated they were better. Of those patients with lymphedema by survey, only 18.5% reported discussing this with their plastic surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the prevalence of lymphedema was similar to published reports in the cancer literature, but much more common than reported in our plastic surgery clinic or recent plastic surgery literature. On the whole, delayed reconstruction appears to have no effect on lymphedema. Although more prospective study is necessary to answer this question conclusively, as part of a multidisciplinary team, plastic surgeons should be aware that lymphedema is common, patients may not volunteer their symptoms and may in fact benefit from specific questioning to aid in diagnosis and treatment.",

      "Content": "Jan 10, 2009 01:05PM - edited Jan 10, 2009 01:46PM by kira Suzy. radiation definitely adds to lymphedema by both irradiating the level 1 nodes and by creating breast lymphedema in most women (70%--although it's usually subclinical.) The extent to which radiation can contribute to lymphedema depends on whether the axillary nodes are being directly irradiated.  To my reading, radiation prevents local recurrence, primarily. It sounds like your oncologist is recommending against it solely based on lymphedema, and discounting survival statistics. I'd want to completely understand his/her decision--lymphedema stinks, but it's better to be here with a swollen arm than not be here. Unfortunately, I have found that the radiation oncologists I dealt with flatly stated that radiation doesn't cause LE: when I have multiple articles that document that it does. Also unfortunately, the New England Journal of Medicine just published a review article on radiation for early breast cancer, and listed few complications--no mention of LE. I think the key questions are survival (does radiation increase survival in stage II cancer, or merely decrease local recurrence--and I don't know the answer, but it sounds like you and your oncologist do) and quality of life and morbidity--the collateral damage of treatment. It's concerning that your other doctors all support radiation, while the oncologist appears to be basing his/her decision on lymphedema. You're young, with young children. I'd vote for doing what is needed to increase your odds of survival, and getting a second, or third opinion from another oncologist so you can gather more expert opinion. Rough choices, I recently read a book by Atul Gawande, Complications, about the move since 1984 to let patients make the medical decisions, yet it's been shown that patients are sick, tired, distracted. In other words, we don't want to be told what to do, but we do need expert guidance. I hope that helps. I also hope you have a lymphedema therapist who can help treat the lymphedema you have, and maybe share their experience with lymphedema after radiation. Suzy, one last comment--radiation is an additive risk factor for lymphedema, but it is not 100%, the statistics are varied, but yes it increases your risk--and you do have it already and it might worsen during treatment and for several months later, but radiation doesn't cause or worsen lymphedema in all women. Hopefully a good radiation oncologist can assist you in the planning to minimize the damage to your lymph nodes.  Kira ",

I do know that Steve Norton, head of the Norton School, doesn't encourage patients to do it, as he doesn't feel their technique is reliable. A LE therapist from the Lahey Clinic, Denise McIntosh, reportedly only teaches techniques she feels that women can do reliably--she does not teach \"stationary circles\" but rather teaches the sweeps and the pull/release moves. I completely agree with NatsFan that having your therapist review your technique is crucial. Binney feels that most of us are too heavy-handed, especially when stressed. I've seen web sites, and my therapists have explained that self-MLD is important as a \"wicking factor\" that clearing the center is actually more important than moving the fluid in the arm. There is a video from JoAnn Rovig of JoviPak, but much of her information is available for free on the web at the Northwest Lymphedema Center self help videos--she's a proponent of the sweep method. www.nwlymphedemacenter.org/  I do self MLD--try and do it daily, and while I've never measured my arm, I feel better after doing it.

I think lymphdivas sleeves are pretty, but I'd only use them in stable people. Juzo is a better fabric, IMO. The Nicole Stout protocol was widely accepted as truth when published, but it's a very flawed study. No control arm. Done only on women immediately post op who are expected to swell and many resolve on their own. I'm similar to you in that I don't have big volume increases, but swell in my hand and forearm, and for a while, when the forearm was acting up, I was always checking the inside tendons to judge it. Maybe try her MLD massage and see if she moves the fluid out of there. Do you swell at night? If you do, then wrapping is an essential tool to have in your tool kit for home management.",

Very few. In the last year, in an effort to make LANA something that trained therapists will take, they've dropped the requirement that you need 135 hours of training AND a year of experience, as most people were not doing well on the anatomy and physiology questions, but did fine on the management questions. So, if a therapist sits for the LANA exam, it shows that they care, but it's no guarantee of high clinical excellence, and the LANA board refuses to \"police\" LANA certified therapists or investigate concerns. I am eligible to sit for the exam, and haven't....My LE therapist was one the first LANA certified therapists, as she's an LMT and insurance doesn't \"recognize\" her qualifications--on PT/OT and PTA/OTA can get reimbursed. Not MD/RN/LMT But, enough about LANA Amoc--as I read your other post, you are in the midst of treatment--a time of high risk to your lymphatics--the taxols are tough on them, and so is radiation--both acutely and chronically with the scar tissue. This is a time where you need your lymphatic system supported. IMO. I also swelled before radiation, and someone told me it would get better after rads, and I clung to that, not realizing the damage that radiation does (I subsequently worked in a radiation oncology facility for 3 years and got a real education about the details, my RO was in major denial, to the point she said that radiation never causes LE (???), and wrote in her note \"Patient reports lymphedema, no swelling noted.\" She never examined my arm/hand, and I was in treatment.....) I have an amazing LE therapist and she's an LMT who is highly trained, and I pay for her out of pocket, but I see her every 2 weeks, and before my recent hysterectomy she took my leg measurements, and follows those along with my arm measurements. She was personally trained by Guenter Klose and then Vodder trained, and she's a firm believer in bandaging. When I worked in radiation oncology, I found so many LE therapists are pushed for time, and get either complacent or feel that patients are unable to handle being active participants in their care, and far too many would do the old PT/OT approach of 6 weeks and out. Your therapist should meet your needs, and right now, you need more attention. Just my opinion. Kira",

If I want to increase the stretch, I bend my knees to the opposite side. The Burt and White LE book says to hold the stretch for 90 seconds, but I just do it until it feels better. Also, because I've seen the videos from Germany, and emailed Jodi Winicour, I will sometimes pull on the area of my SNB scar that makes the cords pop up, and GENTLY stretch them. Hard to do with one hand.  I do it twice a day, after MLD, and then do a little more MLD. I also stretch up and side bend. And, my PT has me lay on the bed, arms straight up, and bend my knees to the opposite side of my surgery. Then, I do it with my hands linked behind my neck. In total agreement with the suckiness. There is another thread that has an acronym: IOS=incidence of suckiness. I can relate. This is an IOS situation. Kira ",

      "Content": "May 28, 2012 06:57AM - edited May 28, 2012 06:58AM by kira Breast lymphedema is very common, there was a recent article that suggested that it occurred in over 50% of the patients treated with breast conservation. They looked at edema: most common in the lower portion of the breast and redness: usually all over. The treatment is lymphedema therapy: massage to move the fluid out and compression garments. Here is a link to the page on it in stepupspeakout: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm It's very common Here's the link to the article: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22... in the conclusion: Breast lymphedema occurs in approximately one-half of women who undergo breast surgery with axillary node removal. There was an \"ask the expert\" about it on bc.org www.breastcancer.org/treatment... Amy: Does lymphedema only occur in the arm or can it be in the breast as well? Answers -Nicole Stout, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : Absolutely! Not only can it be in the breast as well, it can be exclusively in the breast and chest wall, even if it does not appear in the arm. So we need to recognize that breast edema and chest wall edema exist and should be treated. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S. : As a surgeon, I probably see it more acutely than most and have a more difficult time getting other physicians to acknowledge that there is such an entity as lymphedema of the breast which is actually quite uncomfortable for some patients as well as alarming, because it is difficult to ask for treatment for swollen breasts. I think maybe you can comment on how you manage patients like this. Nicole Stout, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would say, first of all, recognition is part of the key. I believe anecdotally that I am seeing more frequency of breast and chest wall swelling - lymphedema, if you will - now with the sentinel node biopsy, as we are removing the direct drainage pathway out of the breast. Unfortunately, it is going far underrecognized. Treatment for breast and chest wall lymphedema is analogous to the way we would treat the arm, meaning that the patients would require lymphatic drainage, compression, therapy, exercise, and skin care. Many of these patients will require custom fit or near-custom compression bras. Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.S.M.: I would say this is an international problem. I was at the Australasian Lymphology Association meeting in Perth in March, and this issue of seeing more breast edema was a theme there. It seems to me that the compression garments and treatments available are not as advanced as they are for arm edema, the compression garments in particular. Nicole Stout, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would agree with that to an extent. I think there are excellent compression bras that exist. I agree with you that we are as not highly evolved in this area in recognition, treatment, and management as we are with the arms. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S. : I would add one note of hope, and it is sort of anecdotal. I think this is one of the few times that lymphedema does have a tendency to regress. It's probably due to the acute injury of the radiation therapy. Breast edema does tend to go down over time, though it may not disappear. It is a very slow resolution of the edema and it's almost never complete. I generally tell patients to expect a very slow, ongoing improvement, even over 2 to 3 years after their radiation therapy, until they reach a stable plateau. I'd be curious if you two have found the same sort of better overall prognosis for the breast edema. ",

Likely not. There are people who can get every single lymph node out and never get it--studies show that some people have an extra lymphatic collector--and others of us who were high risk all along, and some who have just enough triggers to push them over the edge. I agree that early awareness and treatment are key to managing this. Kira ",

You've described so well the suffering, humiliation, the collateral damage, the lack of support from physicians (quit blaming the next guy, and just help) and the exhaustion that comes with this treatment. I think right now, it's overwhelming--and the only advice I would offer it to try and break it down into managable steps: 1) The lymphedema--it hurts, requires daily care, and threatens your violin playing and everyone is playing the blame game--of no value to you, 2) the physical effects of the herceptin--will it be over soon?, 3) the absurdities and humiliation of the medical system--being exposed and cold, all these institutions that can't use your port (not okay--get a supply of butterfly needles and bring them with you), 4) the loss of privacy--in all aspects, 5) the fear that you'll never be attractive again, 6) the fact that co-pays don't count toward out of pocket expenses--big loop hole, right?--be sure and deduct those expenses. It's TOO MUCH. I think as treatment starts to wane, and testing frequency drops off, some of this emotional fallout will get better. You're both in warrior/treatment mode and survivor mode and it's just plain exhausting. You have every right to want your personal modesty respected, and all of your concerns are very, very valid. I'd love to break the situation down into small, managable bits and tackle each one--and the whole time saying \"You don't have to be a good patient. You don't have to just be grateful--you can be upset and angry and grieving.\" I hope some of that helps, and the women on this board are amazing, and I'm sure they'll come along with wisdom and support. For me, lymphedema involves grief, and I don't feel very positive toward my surgeon or rad onc, as neither helped me or acted in a way to prevent it--when they had the opportunity. I'm grateful to be here and have gotten live saving treatment, but that doesn't negate the fact that I incurred a chronic disease along the way, and the treatment impacts the quality of my life.  Sometimes I feel like an ungrateful @@##, but I miss feeling \"healthy\".

Abstract Context Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival. Objective To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. Design, Setting, and Patients The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected. Interventions All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. Main Outcome Measures Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point. Results Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy. Conclusion Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.

One of the lectures, again I think it was by Andrea Cheville MD of Mayo--or someone else as prominent--that person is a trained accupuncturist, and did not find accupuncture helpful for LE. I've found accupuncture to be very operator dependent. The lecturer also said, that in Chinese medicine, you can avoid the at risk quadrant, and put the needles in the energy channels at another place. Deep breathing is key! As is exercise--moves the lymphatic pump. Is your LE therapist going to do the accupuncture? Is it covered? It's a bit unconventional. I'm going to ask Binney to give her opinion.

There is a man, Bob Weiss, who works tirelessly to get garments covered, mostly for medicare. He posted here once, but I can't seem to find it. Binney knows how to reach him. Here's some advice she posted on another thread Anyhow, factoid #1: sleeves and gloves are both called \"compression stockings\" in insurance lingo. (Their willingness to settle for inexact language may be one of the reasons they never make sense when they talk to us.) So when I turn in a prescription for two sets of sleeves and gloves for each arm, I eventually get a letter of approval from my insurance company on which they've typed the words \"1 compression stocking\" eight times. And I'm not making this up! Item #2: Medicare doesn't cover garments, as you discovered. They DO cover them if you've neglected your LE long enough that the lymph fluid is leaking through your pores and causing skin lesions, because then with the open wounds the garments fit the criteria of \"secondary surgical dressing\", see? (I'm not making this up either -- I wish I were!) I actually know two bc Sisters in my town who have no options other than this, so they wait until their skin fails and then they can go get new garments. I hope you all appreciate the calm way I'm writing this, because it's taking tremendous restraint on my part. Item #3: Our friend and lymphedema advocate Bob Weiss is working hard to change these things, but...well, this is not a day when I need to explain to anyone why getting new regulations past Congress can be difficult. He has made some progress, as you will note in this notice on the National Lymphedema Network web site: http://www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQs/legislation/legUpdates/legUpdates_Feb2008.htm Good luck with the insurance companies, and make them give you their names when you talk to them.

I'll post a link, and then you can discuss it with your therapist.    It sounds like she did a great job with the intensive phase, and then kind of dropped the ball for the maintenance phase, initially, and is now re-visiting the plan and will get you good day time compression and night tiime compression as well.    It sounds like your LE is very focal--just the upper arm and the good news is that nighttime garments work much better for that area than hands.    There is an element of trial and error, and I think she didn't anticipate how quickly you'd re-fill and lose the gains you'd made.    I have a great LE therapist who is an LMT and wanted a PT on the case initially, and I went to 5 different PT's--most with excellent credentials--and the quality varied widely, and one in particular started out great and became very unhelpful.      My LE therapist doesn't take insurance, and I work in rad onc and have to refer patients and I've interviewed essentially every LE therapist who takes insurance, and I've yet to find the perfect one, and it's frustrating.     Here's the link to the NLN position papers: www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... And to a treatment page from stepupspeakout: www.stepup-speakout.org/treatm... I've seen this a lot with the patients I refer: they go through the intensive and then are just given a sleeve/glove and wonder why they're back sliding: because the therapist didn't give you all the tools so you could put a wrap on at night and halt the process. Hang in there. Kira",

And with all the changes in health care, a new study like this, might easily be used to deny treatment coverage. I think, as we've all noted before, that if you have a bias it easily shows up in the research, and this research is garbage. But not total garbage, as it is an RCT, but few patients and short f/u and unfortunately, the study concluded that longer standing LE, when irreversible tissue changes have occurred, would need CDT.",

Good for you to interview her, because if she thinks LE has to be in the extremities, then what about head and neck LE, genital LE??

Page last modified on: August 25, 2008 Question from Amy: Does lymphedema only occur in the arm or can it be in the breast as well? Answers -Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : Absolutely! Not only can it be in the breast as well, it can be exclusively in the breast and chest wall, even if it does not appear in the arm. So we need to recognize that breast edema and chest wall edema exist and should be treated. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S.: As a surgeon, I probably see it more acutely than most and have a more difficult time getting other physicians to acknowledge that there is such an entity as lymphedema of the breast which is actually quite uncomfortable for some patients as well as alarming, because it is difficult to ask for treatment for swollen breasts. I think maybe you can comment on how you manage patients like this. Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would say, first of all, recognition is part of the key. I believe anecdotally that I am seeing more frequency of breast and chest wall swelling - lymphedema, if you will - now with the sentinel node biopsy, as we are removing the direct drainage pathway out of the breast. Unfortunately, it is going far underrecognized. Treatment for breast and chest wall lymphedema is analogous to the way we would treat the arm, meaning that the patients would require lymphatic drainage, compression, therapy, exercise, and skin care. Many of these patients will require custom fit or near-custom compression bras. Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.S.M.: I would say this is an international problem. I was at the Australasian Lymphology Association meeting in Perth in March, and this issue of seeing more breast edema was a theme there. It seems to me that the compression garments and treatments available are not as advanced as they are for arm edema, the compression garments in particular . Nicole Gergich, M.P.T., C.L.T.-L.A.N.A. : I would agree with that to an extent. I think there are excellent compression bras that exist. I agree with you that we are as not highly evolved in this area in recognition, treatment, and management as we are with the arms. Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.C.S.: I would add one note of hope, and it is sort of anecdotal. I think this is one of the few times that lymphedema does have a tendency to regress. It's probably due to the acute injury of the radiation therapy. Breast edema does tend to go down over time, though it may not disappear. It is a very slow resolution of the edema and it's almost never complete. I generally tell patients to expect a very slow, ongoing improvement, even over 2 to 3 years after their radiation therapy, until they reach a stable plateau. I'd be curious if you two have found the same sort of better overall prognosis for the breast edema. On Wednesday, April 16, 2008, our Ask-the-Expert Online Conference was called Preventing and Treating Arm Lymphedema. Kathryn Schmitz, Ph.D., M.P.H., F.A.C.S.M.,Nicole Stout Gergich, M.P.T. C.L.T.-L.A.N.A., and moderator Jennifer Sabol, M.D., F.A.S.C. answered your questions about ways to prevent and manage lymphedema. She's just plain in error. Kira",

The amount of compression your garment applies will vary according to your specific needs and the stage of your lymphedema. This compression level is measured in units called \"millimeters of mercury.\" It's written in scientific shorthand like this: mm/Hg. (The \"mm\" stands for millimeters, and the \"Hg\" is the chemical symbol for mercury.) Compression garments are ordered by \"compression class,\" or the range of compression you need, stated in millimeters of mercury. Here's a run-down of compression classes recognized in the United States, along with their usual uses (which may vary with individual circumstances): Class 0: 15-20 mm/Hg - used for those at risk for lymphedema Class I: 20-30 mm/Hg - used for those at risk, or for early or mild lymphedema Class II: 30-40 mm/Hg - used for moderate or severe lymphedema Class III: 40-50 mm/Hg - used for severe or hard-to-control lymphedema To add to the confusion, European compression classes differ slightly from their US counterparts, like so: Class I: 18-21 mm/Hg Class II: 23-32 mm/Hg Class III: 34-46 mm/Hg There is a Class IV as well, with higher numbers of millimeters of mercury, but they are rarely used for arm lymphedema. The fabric used in your garment may be soft (like Juzo's \"Varian Soft\") or sturdy (like Jobst's \"Elvarex\"), or somewhere in between. It may feel flexible or stiff, smooth or rough. All these factors add to your sense of the fit of your garment, and to its effectiveness for you as well. An experienced fitter takes fabric choice into consideration in order to provide you with the garment best suited to your specific needs. A compression sensitive person may need a softer fabric to prevent her fingertips from turning an unhealthy shade of purple, while a person who tends to develop fibrosis easily may do better with a firm and sturdy fabric -even if they both require the same compression level- Recently there was a conference and Jane was told that Jobst was not preferred for flying as it was too soft, that Juzo was better. This was one person's opinion. Hope that helps. Just to make things confusing: a Juzo class 1 glove and a Juzo class 1 sleeve have different mm/Hg numbers...Your fitter should help. Kira ",

Also, any reference that  proves that a foot draw of a superficial vein causes DVT's in ambulatory patients would be appreciated. There is a movement to \"debunk\" lymphedema risk reductions, and this issue of using the at risk arm or an arm with lymphedema has no science, that I'm aware of, to support it.   But it sure is easier for the phlebotomist--   Diane has lymphedema on one side, and an ALND on the other--so technically both arms are off limits for blood draws, blood pressures, IV's.   There are a few women on this forum who have bilateral LE, and they have found physicians and centers that draw blood from their feet, take calf blood pressures and use foot IV's for studes and procedures.   The official position of the National Lymphedema Network would be to avoid any trauma to either the arm with lymphedema or the arm with 18 nodes removed. The last thing Diane needs is another arm with lymphedema.   The surgeons who advocate for their patients and request that you not traumatize their at risk arms may put you in a tough spot, but they are following national concensus guideliines.   I have lymphedema in one arm, and recently my \"good\" arm was used for IV contrast for an MRI: 3 sticks later, and huge bruising, the arm and hand were bruised and sore for almost two weeks. If that happened on an arm that had 18 nodes removed, it could have triggered permanent swelling.   For your future reference, here is a link to the position paper of the NLN on risk reduction guidelines: www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ... Additionally, here is the handout on lymphedema from the Livesstrong Foundation, written by national researcher Jane Armer PhD, who had an ALND and was told not to worry about lymphedema, and developed it within 6 months and has devoted her career to helping other women treat and avoid lymphedema: www.livestrong.org/Get-Help/Le... Diane, in NYC, there is a great lymphedema researcher, Mei Fu PhD at NYU, she is doing a study on women with lymphedema and prevention and can assist you in this issue: Mei R. Fu, PhD, RN, ACNS-BC Assistant Professor Course Coordinator Fundamentals of Nursing College of Nursing New York University 726 Broadway 10th floor NY, NY  10003 mf67@nyu.edu Sorry to be so strident about this, but the movement to \"debunk\" lymphedema risk reduction behaviors is so prevelant, and lymphedema is a chronic, incurable condition, that I get really upset when women are told that it's been proven that precautions are unecessary. Caution is necessary to prevent a chronic disease. I'm sure many women have \"gotten away with it\"--but what about even the one in which it triggers lymphedema? Isn't it better to err on the side of caution and not give women advice unless you have the study that PROVES that it's perfectly safe--over many years? Kira Just realized that the earlier post was in May, and she's not likely to check back in, but I sure hope she does. I just checked and that was the only post she ever made.",

      "Content": "Aug 9, 2010 08:45PM - edited Aug 9, 2010 08:49PM by kira KS1--The NLN position paper on flying actually recommending wrapping for people with LE--so I wear my Solaris with finger spacers--the fitter told me to wrap a single short stretch bandage over it (not sure if the extra compression is needed, but it keeps it clean) and it has worked like a charm. I've actually put it on when I board the plane and take it off within an hour of landing. Wearing your solaris during long car trips is fine, IMO. I agree with you--I don't find compression comfortable, but wrapping or the Solaris feel fine. Wearing it during daytime hours is analagous to wrapping--you'll get a volume reduction. My LE therapist told me that when she worked in NYC, there was a model with LE, and she would go to the gym wrapped. -The program she worked for was based on the Foldi Clinic model, where patients were treated all day for a couple of weeks, and part of the treatment was exercising with bandages on. Patients received 2 MLD sessions a day, and were bandaged/wrapped afterward and did therapeutic exercise. Her approach is \"when in doubt, wrap\"--and the Solaris is a wrapping alternative. Cookie--all the studies I've seen about LE and flying just measure women, they don't look at the reason they might swell, I'll bet it's all of the above--the dehydration, the lack of movement, the salty food, the altitude/pressure in the cabin (some women do swell when they travel to high altitude.)

      "Content": "Feb 5, 2010 02:18PM - edited Feb 5, 2010 02:29PM by kira Rosered,   I hope we didn't make you doubt your therapist--my LE therapist was kind of horrified about the palm swelling because she treated a pediatric dentist whose hand swelling was so hard to control, she had to retire. So, I think it upset her. My palm swelling is mostly at the base of my index finger, and it seems like gloves trap it, and then it goes down. RE: Solaris night garment--they are chipped foam, which, again, my LE therapist considers a bit aggressive, and apply about a 20-30 mm compression. I have one, and use it intermittantly (mostly I wrap--although recently I needed a remedial wrap session, because I was wrapping too tightly and causing problems)--your therapist is correct in her concern that over-compression can cause rebound swelling. I wonder if there's some way you could try one for a couple of hours and see how it impacted you. As JoAnn Rovig--maker of competing night garments JoviPak, says on her blog: You only need night garments if 1) you swell at night and/or 2) you have fibrosis. Have you ever wrapped at night? Do you need to?  If your fingers swell, the gauntlet is not a good choice, you need a glove with fingers. Watch out for the super tight glove--gloves can trap fluid, and too much compression can cause swelling. I have a custom glove, but I also use medi 95 off the shelf gloves, and I'm between a size 2 or 3 (they have 7 sizes) and I was able to try both, and the 2 was just too tight. To massage the palm, I massage up on the upper part, through the fingers to the top of the hand, and down on the lower part to the wrist and forearm, and since the middle finger is weird, I bring that area down as well.  I have a good diagram of the palm, I'll have figure out how to upload it. Kira  Here's the JoAnn Rovig blog--she's a character, and if you read more, you'll find out she refused chemo despite positive nodes and just detoxed... But she makes these products and puts out good self care videos, so take it with a grain of salt www.joannrovig.com/?m=200908Jo... or no JoViPak? Thursday, August 27th, 2009 Good communication is essential to any successful transaction and today we had a good reminder of that. A DME had ordered two JoViPak arm sleeves for a patient who had had a lumpectomy many years ago and a recent mastectomy on the other side. We received a call at JoViPak saying the patient can't wear her new JoViPaks. Because - when she lays down at night her hands and wrists begin to throb. After several conversations with JoViPak Customer Service and the DME, the patient was turned over to me. . . . . . and that is what I am here for! I love talking to patients, and as you may have guessed, we always end up talking about nutrition- particularly if they are a cancer survivor. The most important question I had for her, however, was how well did she tolerate bandaging. Well, she didn't! and that is a question that should have been asked before the order was ever sent in. The next most important question for her was \"Do you swell at night?\" and she didn't think so! (For her own peace of mind, she needs to know that.) It's not unusual for a patient to find a product on the internet and decide it has to be \"the magic bullet.\" What I want to make perfectly clear to anyone considering a night-time garment is this: A foam-filled padded night-time garment serves two functions: 1) contains night swelling and 2) softens fibrosis. If a lymphedema patient has neither, a JoViPak serves no purpose.  ",

I tried to look it up in the International Best Practices guidelines, and they just say that there's no standardization: To assist comparison, therefore, garment packaging and studies involving compression garments should state the pressure ranges and the testing method used to determine the pressures. Joe Zuther wrote in his blog: At the current time there is no national standard for compression classes. However, compression is very similar between the different manufacturers So, frankly I'm confused, I don't think it's as simple as just mm mercury compression, as different fabrics and weaves have more \"containment\"--so for me to wear CCL 1 in Juzo, my glove is 18/21 mm and my sleeve is 20-30 mm.  Okay, to confuse myself more: I logged into the medi site, and the medi 95 gloves that I use off the shelf are CCL 1 20-30mm, but if I submitted a custom glove order, it's the European compression classes. I emailed the medi rep I met at the NLN to try and get an explaination. Any expert fitters out there to explain this to us? Help! Kira",

And his response: You are asking a very good question. The answer is that medi had to change all upper extremity garments to the following: · CCL I - 15-21 mmHg · CCLII - 23-32 mmHg Lower extremity are 18-21 mmHg. All manufacturers that produce or sell products in Germany had to do this. The flat knit garments in 15-21 mmHg will feel as strong as the 20-30 mmHg circular knit garments because of the thicker, stiffer material. You are correct in your analysis. I hope this makes some sense--it's a European standard, and I know the medi off the shelf items are made in the US. Binney??? Please explain further. Kira",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2011 01:08PM - edited Jan 24, 2011 01:08PM by kira Jainey, so few medical providers know about lymphedema--they aren't taught it in medical school or residency and there are so few continuing education lectures on it. There was one study of axillary node dissection, and although most women got LE in the first few years, women continued to get it for the next 20 years, at a lower rate. I posted a link to an article in Cure about limiting LE:  http://www.curetoday.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/article.show/id/2/article_id/1632 Limiting Lymphedema BY KATHY LATOUR One of the primary goals of sentinel node biopsy is to reduce the need for axillary dissection to minimize a woman's chance of getting lymphedema, a chronic buildup of fluid that occurs as a result of the body's impaired ability to drain lymph fluid from tissue. Lymphedema, which can be managed but not cured, can leave a woman's arm significantly enlarged, greatly affecting her quality of life. According to statistics compiled by the American Cancer Society, the percentage of women who get lymphedema as a result of full node dissection and radiation ranges widely, from 6 to 48 percent. While studies concur that sentinel node biopsy reduces the risk of lymphedema, the rates vary depending on a number of factors, such as whether the woman received radiation. But it doesn't eliminate the risk, says Wendy O'Rear, PT, a certified complete decongestive therapist at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. The huge variation in statistics also reflects that whether someone gets lymphedema depends on a number of factors, including location of the tumor, body mass index, age, physical condition and other medical conditions that can contribute to unbalanced fluid levels in the body. O'Rear treats women with lymphedema using complete decongestive therapy, which clears lymphatic pathways of fluid and decompress fluid-filled areas to allow the limb to return to normal or near-normal size. Patients then may use special compression garments to prevent the arm from re-swelling while learning exercises to help the arm eliminate fluid. \"Who gets lymphedema varies, and it's multifactoral,\" says O'Rear. \"I have had women who had sentinel node surgery who swelled immediately, and then I have another patient who had surgery 38 years ago when they took all the nodes and followed it with radiation-and she just got lymphedema.\" Typically, O'Rear says, she sees fewer women with immediate problems if there were fewer than 10 nodes removed and there was no radiation. She emphasizes that it's important for women to understand that the fluid in the tissue contains protein, which is inflammatory and produces scar tissue. When lymphedema is not controlled, it will increase in severity, she says. O'Rear emphasizes that women need to be vigilant for the rest of their lives and follow the guidelines from the National Lymphedema Network (www.lymphnet.org) to reduce their risk. \"We have had women tell us that someone told them that after five years they could begin getting blood pressure taken on the affected arm, and that isn't true,\" O'Rear says. In fact, she says, as women age and their tissue becomes more firm, particularly if they have had radiation, they can lose lymph function faster. Jainey--that's what we're trying to do here, get out the facts--such as they are--and arm women with knowledge. Hope you continue to heal well, and I agree--who of us is \"optimal\"--but we try.

Nothing to worry about. When in doubt, get a copy of your labs and make the onc go through them with you, line by line. I think the onc is just being cautious and wants to see how you're doing. Things to think about: adult pertussis (whooping cough) is very, very common--that's why the new tetanus shots have pertussis in them--DTaP--and it's the \"cough of 100 days\". Early on, you can get special testing where they shove a special q-tip up your nose to diagnose it, but the diagnosis is tougher later in the course. When you diagnose/suspect it, you treat with azithryomycin or another drug in that class--but it doesn't decrease the symptoms, just makes you less infective.

Every day I have to manage it, so I'm aware of the fact that I was treated for breast cancer and I got this complication. I really would like to not have illness as the focus of my life, but LE keeps it front and center.   I also sent a private rant to Binney today about LE being an orphan disease: it's created by physicians who treat you for breast cancer, but treated by massage therapists/PT's/OT's and usually without the guidance of a physician. So, you are abandoned when you develop LE. The usual physical therapy model is a course of treatment, and then you're discharged from therapy. There really isn't another situation in physical therapy where you are treated for a chronic disease--by the therapist, not under supervision of a physician. If your back pain isn't effectively treated by PT, they send you back to the doctor. If your LE doesn't get better--what doctor will \"own\" the problem? Your surgeon? Radiation oncologist? Primary care doctor? They (at least in my case) don't have the knowledge or inclination.   So, aside from not letting me move on with my adjustment to the breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, I have to deal with the frustration of the limited treatment options available to me and the fact that I'm essentially on my own with it. Scary and frustrating.   My LE is in my dominant hand--I have problems if I write too much. It effects my work and recreation. I'll never play tennis again. I have to fear insect bites, poison ivy and plane trips. I'm not sure when I'll do too much, and I am sick of monitoring my body for swelling.    My body swelled and my life shrunk: I spend a lot of time with my arm elevated, in a finger wrap.   I have to factor LE into my life on a daily basis: what garment to wear, what activity can I do, when can I do my self care. It's intrusive, and I resent it.   Ironically, it was MY biggest fear heading into surgery, and the surgeon told me I had a 7% chance of it, not to worry.     LE is embarrassing: I hide my hand or my glove. I don't want to explain why I wear it.    Sorry to be so negative about it today, but my latest LE therapist--a highly trained LMT--decided that I had to leave her and go to a clinic situation. She said it's because she's not reliable, due to child care issues. Really, she doesn't want to bear the primary responsibility for treating my LE. She had been in a hospital setting before she went out on her own. When I called the hospital clinic, I was told that they didn't know that they had too much to offer me, because \"I had done so much already.\" Abandoned, orphaned, inadequately treated. That's what LE does to me. Kira ",

      "Content": "Oct 27, 2011 09:08AM - edited Oct 27, 2011 09:10AM by kira Carol, I would discuss this with the physician: I had a CLT-LANA at Mass General tell me my swelling was not LE--yet I was wrapping and it didn't meet the 2 cm \"gold standard\"--created by 2 PT's for one study and widely adopted yet never studied--except by Jane Armer who found if she used the 2 cm rule, and said that if at any one time, there was one point on the arm that was 2 cm greater, 90% of the >250 women she's been following for nearly a decade had LE. So my swelling was controlled with treatment: does a diabetic no longer have the disease when their sugars are under control, is hypertension gone when it responds to medication??? Why do we have to be swollen, to an arbitrary amount to be considered to meet criteria for LE. LE is a disease without a reliable, reproducible diagnostic criteria. The 10% volume increase meets LE criteria--the Nicole Stout protocol used a 3% increase to initiate compression therapy The Avon Foundation White paper makes it very clear that LE is present before it is measurable, and the perometer is great for arms, but not good for hands, and never used for breasts/trunks. The history makes the diagnosis in truncal, and in stage 1 LE, as it fluctuates by definition. www.avonfoundation.org/program...  Now, the Avon paper is a plug for bioimpedance, which has not been found to be that reliable--Mei Fu found the value reliability in women with LE (multiple measurements same patient, same day) 66%, and she found it insensitive. I have seen patients sent to the LE clinic by their surgeons for \"prevention\" and insurance has denied it: I code it as 457.1 because it is stage 0 to me. LANA is just a test, it's a test that was created in response to the APTA's stance that all PT's can treat LE without additional training, and you must have taken 135 hours of training, practiced for a year, and have college level anatomy and physiology to take the test. It indicates a level of commitment and education. I completely agree with toomuch: the history is compelling, and Mei Fu has also shown that history and symptoms are often much more reliable than one time measurements. There are validated surveys: I'll try and get my hands on one. Kira ",

I'm wondering where you LE therapist is in all of this? They are the ones who are supposed to help you figure out how to transition to maintenance and get you hooked up with a good fitter--if they don't fit themselves. Some people have medicare, which doesn't cover garments. We've all done the order on-line thing: and like everyone else here, I have a closet full of expensive mistakes. So, as a fellow person with hand swelling, the ideal approach for you is a well fitted glove. Sometimes you can get away with an off the shelf glove--Juzo makes nice gloves--I prefer their stronger fabric the expert/helastic, their sizes are a bit rigid, but if it fits, that's great. I also like medi 95 as they're slim and have good finger compression and more size range. And the medi 95 has lower compression at the wrist, so you don't get double compression with a sleeve. In my ideal world, there would be a store where you could try them on for fit. But I've never experienced that, except when you go to a conference and can see the vendor's wares. So, for someone whose LE has come back with a boom, you should have a well fitted sleeve and glove. I personally never tried the all in one, as while it is a nicer fit at the wrist, it's a royal pain to wash your hands. And, for night time, if you swell--wrapping is the best, and if you get sick of wrapping, you can try the night garments, but they are expensive, and personally, I have a closet full of expensive night garments that don't do a great job on my hand.....Seriously: a jovipak, 2 Tributes, a readywrap and I'm finding the best bet for me is a Caresia sleeve that goes to my hand and I finger wrap and do 2 short stretches over it. My $600 Tribute chews up my hands.....The Caresia is $140 retail....And I got it as a sample at my CLT class, and never tried it for a year. So, with hand swelling--always compress the hand. And ideally not with a gauntlet, but with a glove. And gloves are hard to fit and expensive. Does that help? Kira I went to pm you and saw that you're being treated at U of M: I went to school there, and they do have a good LE program, from what I've heard.",

Personally, I think it's kind of in beta testing, and they need to work out the issues with it, but it is inexpensive (relatively) and should give you control over the fit, although it's a bit hard to create graduated compession with the velcro closures, and it's only supposed to be hand washed.

Many women get cording, and not all of them get LE, but while the cording is actively present, the lymphatic system is not functioning well, and can be overwhelmed and LE can result. In the link I put in above, there are active links to the abstract and AWS page on SUSO. There's lots of misinformation out there amongst health care providers about LE, because they're not taught about it, and would like to believe that SNB has eradicated it.  I'm living proof that it hasn't.

Or more insane Last year, my hand was being so bad: I had started a new job--was writing with my bad hand, swelling at the wrist, and my fingers were constantly acting up. And my response was to wrap tighter and tighter. So, one day, my brilliant LE therapist sat down with ne, and said \"When you wake up in pain at 3 am from the wrapping, it's not a good sign, and all those red marks you leave on your skin are a sign that you're damaging the fragile lymphatics.\" And she re-taught me how to wrap with less pressure, so it was comfortable. And, go figure, everything got better. I really think if we compile the stories of all of us, we would see that it is worse at the beginning and as we treat it, it does--slowly--get better. You and Kane are new to treatment: and I firmly believe that things will get better--it takes 2 years to do the initial healing from radiation, and scar remodeling takes at least a year, and if you're going to regenerate collateral lymph vessels--there's no data, but it seems to take a couple of years. Kane--a lot of women on this board have gone to Chickley, and then it becomes some sort of us vs, them thing. As Binney's Vodder trained therapist says \"We have our snake oil and they have theirs.\" I think if something works, it works. I personallly ban my husband from the room when any LE self care is occuring: the dog can stay. Flares stink, and they impact us emotionally and some of that panic and despair must be a biological response. Kira",

My LE therapist has told me about women who get prophylactic antibiotics when they get recurrent infections. Unfortunately, each cellulitis causes some damage and sets you up for another one. The standard work up for immunodeficiency is a blood count, quantitative immunoglobulins with IgG subsets. There is a web page for primary immunodeficiencies: http://www.jmfworld.com/ They're common: 1/600 has IgA deficiency (my daughter has it--figured out after an ER visit for asthma) My allergist is intense and he figured out I have low IgG subsets, after a million sinus infections. I do take low dose azithromycin, because it's been well studied for people who fail multiple sinus surgeries. There are lots of articles out there, but here's a free one, from Chest www.chestjournal.org/content/1...  Even if there's no immune deficiency, some doctors will give antibiotics prophylactically to avoid infection for a period of time and let you really heal. Perhaps your LE therapist knows of a physician with knowledge/interest in treating LE. Kira ",

The swelling could be LE--and the best person to tell you is a qualified LE therapist. You'll need a referral from one of your doctors, and it wouldn't hurt to have them check you out as well. The need to remove your ring is a common presentation of LE. But, don't jump to conclusions until you're checked out. And the earlier you're evaluated, if it is LE the earlier you'll be able to treat it and get it under control. Here's a link to how to find a therapist: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And here's a link on what to do while waiting for your evaluation: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm  What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled. If you go to the website, there are more links in the text to additional information.  I hope the information helps, and I hope it's not LE, but if it is, we're here and it is treatable. Kira ",

Maybe it's only been standardized on the inner portion of the arm, but the T cells don't discriminate, they'll come after it on your thigh. They can't force you to take a risk for this. Tell them to call the CDC if they have questions. When I googled \"alternate sites for PPD testing\" I got a pdf from Vermont Dept of Health which said: Alternative sites such as the upper back  or shoulder, or back side of upper arm,  may be used when the forearms are  inaccessible or unsuitable.   And here's the CDC site: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/ I know you're trying to avoid the upper quadrants, but if the upper back is ok, why isn't the thigh?

I think you're both in the latter group. There is a third group, those who are really compliant, but still have swelling--the most frustrating. There is a researcher in the UK--AW Stanton--and he published a paper last year where he was able to use special imaging to look at the lymphatic systems of women with LE, and those with LE had some issues even in their good side. I had found a great \"patient perspective\" in lymphology, about a woman who banged her hand in a car park almost a decade after her mastectomy and developed LE, and was distraught, but at the end of the essay, as long as she does MLD, her hand and arm are in excellent control. We call LE incurable, but if it's negligible, isn't that control to the point of clinical insignificance? I think you're both success stories, and you give me hope.  Kira ",

Also, a sentinel node biopsy--where a pathologist will check out the node(s) that drain your breast and let the surgeon know if more need to come out is the standard of care. Some surgeons will get an axillary ultrasound with a fine needle biopsy before surgery as well. Too much information, but navygirl is SO right. Kira ",

Most surgeons do regional anesthesia with a tourniquet and besides the trauma of cutting over the wrist, the tourniquet is a big problem. I don't have my hands on the abstract right now, but maybe Binney can find it. I'd be worried also--have they tried a less aggressive approach, like splints or a cortisone shot? The risks are worsened lymphedema from the trauma of surgery and infection. You're right to be concerned.Lymphoedema and hand surgery. I did a pubmed search and found this from 1999 Smith WK, Giddins GE. Orthopaedic Department, Royal United Hospital, Bath, UK. We report the case of a woman with a previous history of breast carcinoma, treated with a left radical mastectomy and axillary clearance, who developed lymphoedema in the left arm following a carpal tunnel decompression complicated by a superficial wound infection. PMID: 10190630 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] And this is the one Binney passed around, it's a bit more reassuring: www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15...  Postmastectomy lymphedema and carpal tunnel syndrome. Surgical considerations and advice for patients] [Article in German] Assmus H, Staub F. Neurochirurgische Gemeinschaftspraxis, Dossenheim/Heidelberg. assmusdombert@t-online.de PURPOSE: Following surgery for breast cancer, an increased risk is assumed for development or worsening of lymphedema following hand surgery procedures. The aim of this study was to find out whether surgery performed with exsanguination using a pneumatic tourniquet has any disadvantages under these circumstances. There might result consequences for patients' information of possible risks as well as for performance of hand surgical procedures. METHOD: 52 patients who had undergone mastectomy were included in the study. In 47 of these, axillar lymph node biopsy or dissection had been performed. 41 patients had been advised not to allow measurement of blood pressure, drawing of blood or surgery to that arm. Surgical release of the retinaculum flexorum by using local anesthesia and exsanguination for a maximum of ten minutes was performed at an average of 7.5 (range from 1 - 26) years after the breast operation. RESULTS: Following release of the carpal ligament a temporary swelling of the arm or hand was found in four patients, which persisted for 2 - 3 months in one patient and disappeared within one week in the others. Three patients suffered from moderate lymphedema before surgery. It was unaffected by hand surgery in two patients and only temporarily worsened for several days in another patient. In all patients, neurological symptoms (paresthesia, numbness and pain) improved completely. Other complications, particularly infections, were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Exaggerated information of patients with breast surgery in their history does not seem to be indicated in minor hand surgical procedures. 2. The hand surgeon should inform the patients preoperatively that there may occur a transient swelling which can be avoided by loose dressings and early functional training. Using a pneumatic tourniquet has no adverse effect on existing lymphedema in short lasting procedures. 3. Since patients after mastectomy and/or axillary dissection often complain about arm pain and paraesthesia, not only brachial plexus pathology but also a carpal tunnel syndrome must be considered. Good luck. Kira ",

Just thinking about these boards, at least three more women come to mind. I believe Jane said she was patient #249 or so and the 181 st patient to develop it after flying.   I work in radiation oncology, and I take care of women who are getting whole breast radiation, and women who are getting radiation to their nodes. At the end of treatment, they're often really inflammed, with broken down skin. The head rad onc always talks to the patients about LE and says that it's a mismatch of blood flow and the ability of the lymph nodes to provide filtration, and that inflammation and redness/burns brings a whole lot of blood flow to the area.   We see women back a month out (or sooner if their skin is an issue) and a lot of healing has occured by then.   If you fly: please get a new, well fitting sleeve and gauntlet. And consider waiting a few weeks after rads before you fly.   Andrea Cheville, of Mayo Clinic, wrote a great piece for LymphaDivas on why women at risk should wear hand protection with their sleeves, here's the link: lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gau...    Now, I got LE three weeks out of surgery, and I didn't fly for another year and a half, and I flew with a special night garment that is essentially like flying wrapped. And it went just fine. And it was liberating. So, I don't want you to be constrained by fear of LE, but rather to avoid getting it. Here's a link to the National Lymphedema Network position papers, and one is on air travel: www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQ...  I don't want you to ever join the swell sorority, but you have to enjoy yourself as well.

      "Content": "Jan 21, 2011 09:41AM - edited Jan 21, 2011 10:03AM by kira Heidi- I'm sorry if this sounds like a rant--but I've spoken to Dr. Schmitz and emailed her, and she says she wants the facts to be very clear--but her official web site is exactly what you wrote, and it's misleading, and potentially dangerous, IMO. -the JAMA article by Schmidtz et al showed that weight lifting by women \"at risk\" done in a VERY controlled manner, did not cause more lymphedema, and in the  women (94) who had >5 nodes out there was a reduction--but the number was so small, and it is just one study, that no conclusion could be drawn. Here are the facts: from the article: Results A total of 134 participants completed follow-up measures at 1 year. The proportion of women who experienced incident BCRL onset was 11% (8 of 72) in the weight lifting intervention group and 17% (13 of 75) in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). Among women with 5 or more lymph nodes removed, the proportion who experienced incident BCRL onset was 7% (3 of 45) in the weight lifting intervention group and 22% (11 of 49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 woman in the weight lifting intervention group and 3 women in the control group (1.5% vs 4.4%, P for equivalence = .12). Conclusion In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.  Okay, so that's impressive--but it's one study and very small numbers. On her PAL site, Schmidtz does state that women with >5 nodes had a 70% decrease of onset of lymphedema--of course that was only in the first year, and we're talking about 94 women who did a study and were closely followed--it can not be a global recommendation to lift weights if you had >5 nodes to reduce LE. When you read the article in JAMA, the conclusion discussion is that weight lifting did not rise to the level of \"superiority\" but caused no harm--but these women used a very specific protocol, called the PAL protocol, lifted light weights with few reps, supervised, for two days a week along with stretches. Here's the SABC abstract: http://www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs10/view.php?nu=SABCS10L_9027 Balancing Risks of Deconditioning vs. Weight-Lifting for Breast Cancer Survivors. Schmitz KH, Cheville A, Ahmed RL, Troxel A. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN Background Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors with and at-risk for lymphedema have advised against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight-lifting. The primary hypotheses of the Physical Activity and Lymphedema Trial were that lymphedema onset and worsening would not differ after a one-year weight-lifting intervention compared to no exercise among survivors at risk for and with breast cancer-related lymphedema. Methods We performed a randomized controlled trial of a twice- weekly progressive weight-lifting intervention involving 141 breast cancer survivors with stable arm lymphedema at study entry and 154 survivors at-risk for lymphedema at study entry. Treatment group participants were provided a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction; the remaining nine months were unsupervised. Control group participants were provided the intervention after study completion. The primary outcome was the change in arm swelling at one year, as measured by water volumetry of the affected and unaffected arms. Secondary outcomes included the clinician defined incidence of onset and exacerbations of lymphedema, lymphedema symptoms, and muscle strength. Participants with lymphedema were required to wear a well-fitted compression garment while weight-lifting. Results Among the women who entered the study with lymphedema, the proportion who experienced a 5% or greater increase in arm swelling (interlimb difference) was similar in the treatment and control groups (11 % versus 12%; cumulative incidence ratio [95% confidence interval], 1.00 (0.88 to 1.13) As compared with the control group, the women in the intervention group with lymphedema had greater improvements in self-reported lymphedema symptom severity (p=0.03), and a lower incidence of lymphedema exacerbations as assessed by a certified lymphedema specialist (14% versus 29% in the control group, p= 0.04). Among the women who entered the study without lymphedema, more control than treatment group women experienced lymphedema onset defined by 5% increase in interlimb difference (17 versus 11%, p = 0.35). Among higher risk women (5+ lymph nodes removed), this comparison was statistically significant (22 versus 7%, p=0.04). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 treatment and 3 control group women (p=0.62). Conclusions Slowly progressive weight-lifting had no significant impact on arm swelling among breast cancer survivors with lymphedema, and resulted in a reduced incidence of lymphedema flares and improvement in symptoms. In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight-lifting, compared with no intervention, did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema. In secondary analyses, women with 5+ nodes removed who did weight-lifting were less likely to experience increases in arm swelling. Wednesday, December 8, 2010 6:00 PM So, we all need to know the facts and limitations of the study and what it means for woman in the real world--who are not in a clinical study. I sure wish she wouldn't declare that weight lifting decreases the incidence of lymphedema in women with >5 nodes by 70% on her PAL web site---one study, just a few women, short follow up, can't make a global recommendation.

Giuliano AE, Hunt KK, Ballman KV, Beitsch PD, Whitworth PW, Blumencranz PW, Leitch AM, Saha S, McCall LM, Morrow M. John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center, 2200 Santa Monica Blvd, Santa Monica, CA 90404, USA. giulianoa@jwci.org Comment in: * JAMA. 2011 Feb 9;305(6):606-7. Abstract CONTEXT: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) accurately identifies nodal metastasis of early breast cancer, but it is not clear whether further nodal dissection affects survival. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) on survival of patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis of breast cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial, a phase 3 noninferiority trial conducted at 115 sites and enrolling patients from May 1999 to December 2004. Patients were women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer, no palpable adenopathy, and 1 to 2 SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section, touch preparation, or hematoxylin-eosin staining on permanent section. Targeted enrollment was 1900 women with final analysis after 500 deaths, but the trial closed early because mortality rate was lower than expected. INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent lumpectomy and tangential whole-breast irradiation. Those with SLN metastases identified by SLND were randomized to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment. Those randomized to ALND underwent dissection of 10 or more nodes. Systemic therapy was at the discretion of the treating physician. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall survival was the primary end point, with a noninferiority margin of a 1-sided hazard ratio of less than 1.3 indicating that SLND alone is noninferior to ALND. Disease-free survival was a secondary end point. RESULTS: Clinical and tumor characteristics were similar between 445 patients randomized to ALND and 446 randomized to SLND alone. However, the median number of nodes removed was 17 with ALND and 2 with SLND alone. At a median follow-up of 6.3 years (last follow-up, March 4, 2010), 5-year overall survival was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%-94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%-95.1%) with SLND alone; 5-year disease-free survival was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%-86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%-87.9%) with SLND alone. The hazard ratio for treatment-related overall survival was 0.79 (90% CI, 0.56-1.11) without adjustment and 0.87 (90% CI, 0.62-1.23) after adjusting for age and adjuvant therapy. CONCLUSION: Among patients with limited SLN metastatic breast cancer treated with breast conservation and systemic therapy, the use of SLND alone compared with ALND did not result in inferior survival.",

We did get a pure bred puppy in 1990, and she was a medical mess--needed a hip replacement, and had dog aggression issues, but loved us to the best of her ability and lived to be 14. When she died, my older daughter found our current dog on petfinders.com--she came from a puppy mill, and her mom was a pure bred shepherd, dad was an aussie--her brother looked like an aussie. She has her issues: can be timid, but overall, what a love. I don't know much about schnauzers, but my BIL and SIL always have one. Jane knows a lot: she is breed specific with cocker spaniels. Binney just kind of lucked into golden doodles, while waiting forever for golden retriever rescue. My daughter got her sato puppy from a shelter after doing the rounds of rescues and shelters and getting no where. Her vet advised her where to go. I get my advice from my older sister (into border collies) and Jane. Puppies can be a royal pain, but they sure are cute, and hard to resist. Kira",

In 1999, Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation launched an outpatient lymphedema program. When it became clear that patients with advanced disease were experiencing transportation, home, and traditional outpatient therapy challenges, an inpatient program was developed. Since then, patients throughout the region - with some coming from as far as Oklahoma and Illinois - have turned to Siskin Hospital for help managing their lymphedema. Inpatient Care for Advanced Lymphedema Patients with stage III lymphedema - characterized by severe swelling and the presence of fibrotic tissue - are indicated for inpatient care. At this stage, limbs are so swollen that the ability to carry out daily activities is compromised. Patients also usually suffer from other comorbidities and have an increased risk of developing nonhealing wounds. These complications make it necessary to provide an intensive inpatient multidisciplinary treatment program. Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation requires a physician's referral for inpatient lymphedema treatment. As soon as a referral and medical records are received, the lymphedema program coordinator and the medical director determine the patient's appropriateness for the inpatient level of care. Treatment typically starts on the day of admission and discharge plans are rapidly developed as specific information related to the patient's needs are identified. In addition to lymphedema therapy, treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, nutritional counseling, nursing care and education. \"Extensive training is necessary to help patients achieve success,\" says John Jordi, B.S., PTA, CLT-LANA, CI, Lymphedema Program Coordinator at Siskin Hospital. \"Our goal is to eventually work ourselves out of a job, so that patients with this chronic condition can manage it on their own, allowing them to live a more normal and functional lifestyle.\" Therefore, a large focus of the inpatient lymphedema program is educating patients on how to self-manage this chronic condition for the long term. Patients are taught self-MLD (manual lymphatic drainage), a customized exercise plan, how to wrap their limbs to maintain the right amount of compression, how and why to wear compression garments and how to do regular skin checks to help prevent skin breakdown, wounds and infections. When patients arrive for inpatient care, they spend three hours a day with a certified lymphedema therapist. Patients generally begin seeing results during their first week of therapy. \"While they are here, we expect that patients will have a fair amount of independence,\" says Jordi. \"Most patients with severe lymphedema have limited range of motion, so our occupational therapists work with them and assist with activities of daily living, such as bathing, toileting and dressing. Their limbs have often become so swollen that they have stopped performing basic tasks at home, such as tying their own shoes or even wearing shoes.\" Physical therapy is initially a large part of the program because patients have to learn proper and safe walking techniques, particularly while wearing compression wraps. The Fitness Center at Siskin Hospital located on the hospital's main campus offers a multitude of adaptive fitness equipment that can accommodate patients who have limitations. According to Jordi, family support is also paramount to achieving successful outcomes. Family members and caregivers are encouraged to participate during therapy sessions to learn how to assist lymphedema patients with wrapping, while also helping the patients to maintain as much independence as possible. Enhancing Patient Convenience As more patients have sought care through Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation's inpatient lymphedema program, it has recently expanded to include an in-house durable medical equipment (DME) company. This service allows patients to be fitted with the proper compression garments on site. It is especially beneficial for breast cancer patients who have trunk swelling following lymph node removal, as it can be difficult for them to find the correct garments. \"With wrapping, we expect change every day,\" says Jordi. \"As patients' limbs continue to shrink and approach normal size, we have to customize wrappings to accommodate these changes. Once the limbs have reached optimal size, patients can be fitted for more permanent compression garments. Having the DME component on site is advantageous for everyone involved. Patients can receive their bandages and garments much faster than if they ordered them online.\" Transitioning to Outpatient Care Following four weeks of inpatient care, most patients complete two to four weeks of outpatient therapy. \"To ensure success, we make the transition from inpatient to outpatient care as seamless as possible,\" says Jordi. \"After completion of the inpatient program, most patients experience great improvements in their overall health. Wounds resolve or improve and blood sugar levels improve in patients with diabetes. It is essential that patients maintain the skills and healthy habits they have learned. We don't want them to lose any ground that they have gained.\" During the outpatient phase, their customized garments are ready, so a large portion of therapy focuses on teaching patients how to use them appropriately. \"These garments can be difficult for patients to get on and off when they first receive them,\" says Jordi. \"Currently, we are working with a research team at Western Carolina University to develop a product to assist patients with putting on their compression garments.\" Collaborating With Referring Physicians The staff at Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation puts special emphasis on ensuring that patients' primary care physicians are kept updated on their progress, so physicians can see how patients improve once the excess fluid has been removed. Every patient who completes the lymphedema program at Siskin Hospital for Physical Rehabilitation is referred back to his or her primary care physician for follow-up. To make an inpatient referral, please call (423) 634-1246. *Patients who have stage I or stage II lymphedema do not require inpatient care, but may benefit from outpatient therapy consisting of 15 treatments over a four-week period. To make an outpatient referral, please call (423) 634-1500. For more information, please visit www.SiskinRehab.org. Here is Pat's comment: Pat O'Connor Posted Sunday, June 19, 2011 at 7:39:55 AM I know John Jordi, the LE therapist and have heard many many good things about him and his care of his patients. I would recommend Siskin and John to anyone. Pat O'Connor High praise from an expert in LE.

But there was no control group, and 3% post op swelling is common, and some women went on to get LE. Did the preventive wearing of sleeves with any swelling help women? We don't know yet, because no one has replicated the study with a control group, where they leave them alone and see what happens. I would be very concerned if wearing the sleeve is causing wrist swelling. Daytime compression garments are part of entire LE treatment which includes MLD by therapist, self MLD, therapeutic exercises, risk reduction behaviors and possible night time wrapping. Daytime garments don't reduce volume, they maintain it. So, I wouldn't accept any wrist swelling--the garments may be pushing/trapping fluid--I'd get in touch with her. Here is a link to proper fitting of garments, and the double compression at the wrist is a real issue for many women. Some manufacturers, like medi--in their 95 series--do half compression at the wrist in the sleeve and glove so the wrist isn't an area where you trap fluid http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm You don't need new problems created by your treatment.

Here's what Carol wrote: community.breastcancer.org/for...  dlt10960, Your certified personal trainer can ask for a copy of the PAL Protocol. The Univ of Pennsylvania does not give it out to us mere mortals, but they will give it to a qualified trainer. Here's the link to fill out the form to ask for it: http://www.penncancer.org/physical-activity-and-lymphedema/receive-pal-intervention-materials/ The PAL Protocol is a very detailed explanation of the exercises used during the PAL trial, and your trainer will know just how to interpret the information in the document. As a general description, for upper body work, the idea is to start with very low weight (1 lb..feels silly but that's the research-based way to minimize LE risk), add in very small increments, gradually, lifting 2x per week. If you miss more than a session, back off the weight to the prior increment. Avoid body-weight exercises that have you bearing weight on the upper body (i.e. push up, plank), because it's not feasible to know how much weight you are bearing, nor to build in small, measured increments. Bodyweight exercises are possible after you have built up through the slow weight progression over time. If you have an LE diagnosis: wear a sleeve and gauntlet or glove. If you do not have an LE diagnosis: it's a judgment call. Any tingly feeling, or heavy feeling in your affected arm? If so, try to see an LE therapist now for an evaluation, because you may have subclinical (net yet visible) LE, and in that case, were it me, I would be wearing the sleeve/gauntlet when lifting weights. (And if you have the tingly/heavy feeling, get that eval even if you're not going to lift weights, because research suggests that if you treat it while it's subclinical, you may be able to reverse it.) Your instinct to start working with a trainer to lift weights is spot on. Think about this: if we can condition our arms/trunk to lift heavier weights, the fact of lifting heavier weight will be less likely to get the lymphatic system all excited and trigger LE. The trick is to avoid triggering LE while you lift gym weights to build up your ability to lift daily-life weights--hence the slow (annoyingly slow) pace of adding weights to your program. For lower body: Have at it, except of course, watch for lifts that also require help from the upper body, like dead lifts and weighted squats. The PAL Protocol helps your trainer interpret this. I don't think you're being silly at all, and activity like raking is highly repetitive against resistance, so I think you do want to stop and rest pretty often. I hope someone else will drop in here and suggest strategies for doing that kind of work while taking some LE precautions. Good luck with all of the above! I have LE in my upper arm and on the side of my trunk, and I am now about 8 weeks into weight training, following the PAL Protocol, with a certified trainer. The weights I'm lifting are humorously light compared to before my bmx last summer. But I also take great pleasure in reporting that I can tell I'm regaining my prior strength, and so far (knock on wood), I have not had a single experience of my LE flaring during or after a training session. (Wish I could say that about flying, sigh. I need a research-based FLY protocol!) I wear a men's short-sleeved Under Armour compression shirt to support my LE side, in addition to wearing the sleeve and gauntlet while training. There is a NLN position paper on exercise, but Carol says it much better, IMO. Is your PT trained in lymphedema??? If not, they will not know how to treat it. Early on I saw a PT who said she was trained, and her advice was all wrong, and likely caused me to get it so early on. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin...  Kira ",

It did come back, but then slowly went away. It was there two weeks post op, and the surgeon asked ME what to do, and I told her to leave it alone. Then, a year or so later, there was a study, just presented as an abstract, linking seromas to LE. But if it is a hematoma, it's all clotted and likely won't drain. A seroma is lymph/serous fluid, hematoma is blood. If it's gone down from a golf ball to a thumb nail, it sounds like it's on it's way out, without the risk of a needle. www.abstracts2view.com/sabcs10... I have to ask, what's with the surgeon, sending you to the family doctor? Surgeons drain seromas, not typically primary care doctors. After all, the surgeon caused it. Hope you find a therapist soon!

Likely not, but still. The same rad onc dictated \"patient states she has LE, no swelling seen\" Needless to say, I don't see her anymore. So, I was passive, and scared and floundering. Yeah, if I had to do it again, I'd know better, but at the time, I'm just incredibly lucky I found this forum and Binney--but I already had LE. I fight back now, but the proverbial horse is already out of the barn..... I just hope all my posts help this forum can arm other women so they don't make the same mistakes I did. Kira",

My rad onc actually denied that rads caused or exacerbated LE....clueless... The reality is that  whole breast radiation \"hits\" much of the level I/II nodes with a fairly significant dose of radiation, even when the axilla is not targeted. Even with IMRT, it depends on the tangents, but much of the area will receive a hefty dose of radiation. However, there are studies that show a survival and recurrence benefit from lumpectomy with radiation over mastectomy and it's thought that maybe that radiation to the axilla may be part of it. But, whole breast radiation, even when not aimed at the axilla, increases the risk of LE.  Stanley Rockson MD of Stanford, on his Lymphatic Research and Education site, says that radiation increases the risk of LE to around 15- 25%.  Actually, no one knows what the actual risk is, because there is no single standard to either define or diagnose LE. However, there have been recent studies showing that with SNB--and add the scars of oncoplastic breast surgery in--the incidence of breast LE is quite high, but unfortunately, quite too often not recognized or diagnosed. But, it has a tendency to improve with time and you are getting the correct treatment. I worked in radiation oncology, and many of the women developed breast LE during treatment--I would see the exaggerated pore size as treatment progressed, but so many also improved with time. Radiation has acute--inflammation, burn, swelling--issues and chronic issues--fibrosis. Treating the breast with MLD will help with both. One of the women on these board was treated for radiation fibrosis with trental and vitamin E and did very well--she was treated at Sloan Kettering. So, the bottom line is that you're young and the point of breast conservation is to use radiation to prevent the local recurrences. It is likely to flare your breast LE, but you're on top of it.  The only ways to avoid radiation to the axillary nodes is 1) brachytherapy--where they put an implant in the breast and do twice daily treatments for 5 days--but lots of issues with cosmetic outcomes and recurrence risks, or 2) prone position--laying with breasts down on the table My vote is to treat the breast cancer completely, but with awareness and discussion to minimize--if possible--the LE. And that would be to discuss the radiation planning with your rad onc.   Kira",

You really shouldn't wear a sleeve without hand protection, like a gauntlet, as you don't want to push fluid into the hand.

Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled.

LIkely the ability of the lymphatics that drain your arm were overwhelmed by the combination of the violin playing and then the yard work.  Before we have visible swelling, we can have excess fluid in the tissues, and then the balance is tipped toward swelling.

[Epub ahead of print] Breast Cancer-Related Arm Lymphedema: Incidence Rates, Diagnostic Techniques, Optimal Management and Risk Reduction Strategies. Shah C, Vicini FA. Source Department of Radiation Oncology, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI. Abstract As more women survive breast cancer, long-term toxicities affecting their quality of life, such as lymphedema (LE) of the arm, gain importance. Although numerous studies have attempted to determine incidence rates, identify optimal diagnostic tests, enumerate efficacious treatment strategies and outline risk reduction guidelines for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), few groups have consistently agreed on any of these issues. As a result, standardized recommendations are still lacking. This review will summarize the latest data addressing all of these concerns in order to provide patients and health care providers with optimal, contemporary recommendations. Published incidence rates for BCRL vary substantially with a range of 2-65% based on surgical technique, axillary sampling method, radiation therapy fields, and the use of chemotherapy. Newer clinical assessment tools can potentially identify BCRL in patients with subclinical disease with prospective data suggesting that early diagnosis and management with noninvasive therapy can lead to excellent outcomes. Multiple therapies exist with treatments defined by the severity of BCRL present. Currently, the standard of care for BCRL in patients with significant LE is complex decongestive physiotherapy (CDP). Contemporary data also suggest that a multidisciplinary approach to the management of BCRL should begin prior to definitive treatment for breast cancer employing patient-specific surgical, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy paradigms that limit risks. Further, prospective clinical assessments before and after treatment should be employed to diagnose subclinical disease. In those patients who require aggressive locoregional management, prophylactic therapies and the use of CDP can help reduce the long-term sequelae of BCRL. I read that abstract, and think--my we've come a long way. They acknowledge that chemo, radiation and surgical technique are important in LE and suggest the team all talk to each other to minmize the risk and early LE therapy is best.  Even when I was treated, none of this was standard. My rad onc told me that studies proved that radiation NEVER caused LE.... Lots more articles where that came from. Kira  Kira",

I'm very concerned that they're using your arm for chemo--lymphedema occurs when the lymphatic system is unable to handle the load--so you try not to compromise it--the fact that your veins are being irritated on a regular basis can lead to inflammation, and compromise of the lymphatic system, which is already compromised from the surgery. I work in rad onc, and I have a number of patients who have had bilateral node removals, and there is so much resistance to 1) taking ankle blood pressures 2) doing foot draws 3) not putting an IV in \"at risk\" arm if it means a port, a neck IV or a foot IV I think seeing a lymphedema therapist is a wonderful idea: you'll get measured, assessed and risk reduction will be reinforced--and hopefully you'll have another advocate to support your sense that the arm must be protected from harm. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... If you meet resistance, tell them that the risk of lymphedema with \"just\" a sentinel node biopsy is unknown--as no one agrees on the diagnostic criteria--but at a minimum it approaches 10% and there are plenty of women on these boards who got it with just a few nodes out--or on the side of a prophylactic mastectomy, with no axillary surgery. Even with just a low risk, if happens to you--it;s 100%. One of the women on this board, when faced with resistance,told her doctor that if he/she wanted to have lymphedema for her, then they could ignore her risk. Trust your instincts: you have swelling and redness--they need to leave that arm alone and you need an evaluation. Please let us know how you're doing. Kira",

It was early physiotherapy for women with ALND and it consisted of typical lymphedema therapy as well as stretches--no weight lifting, and there was a subset of women who developed axillary web syndrome who overwhelmingly developed LE. It's a free article, with the link you provided' http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806631/ Here's the intervention: Intervention The early physiotherapy group was treated by a physiotherapist with a physiotherapy programme including manual lymph drainage, massage of scar tissue, and progressive active and action assisted shoulder exercises. This group also received an educational strategy. The control group received the educational strategy only.  I've spoken with Dr. Schmitz, I've read her articles and heard her lecture at the NLN conference: you can not make a global recommendation that weight lifting will reduce the onset of lymphedema by 70% when it was only observed in 45 women, observing a strict protocol-- The global recommendation is that women should be active and do it gradually, but if you read Dr. Schmitz's conclusions--she doesn't extrapolate that tiny subset finding to a global recommendation, she just says that careful, progressive weight lifting appears to be safe. We can not state that weight lifting prevents lymphedema by 70% in all women with >5 nodes removed--the data just isn't there, and if you talk to women clincally, many of whom did Livestrong protocols, they have developed LE with weight lifting. We can't disseminate misinformation: we can report on early promising studies, but we need to be very, very careful about the comments we state as indisputable facts. If a woman followed your advice--without the caveats of doing this specific protocol with a certified trainer-- and developed LE, how would you feel? Kira",

This time, I saw this PT, LANA certified, who decided that because my arm isn't swollen (yes, I do wrap it every night, so it's treated--I called a lymphedema researcher in NYC after this who said \"If a person has high blood pressure and you give them medicines and it comes down, do they no longer have high blood pressure. NO, it's just treated.) So, this \"well trained\" therapist had me do theraband exercises in the office, without compression, and besides swelling, I get a cord!!!  Luckily, I can email the world's expert PT on axillary web, Jodi Winicour, and aside from a great comment about my luck with PT's (I have no luck at all, except in cyber-relationships...) and she told me to just gently stretch and we'll try and meet sometime so she can stretch it. Jodi told me that she knew of 2 cases where a cord was snapped, and the women developed lymphedema. So, she's treated hundreds of cases of axillary web with specific stretching of the cords, but she won't deliberately snap them. I wrote the darn page on AWS on stepupspeakout, thinking it was all behind me, but it's right there in my arm again. www.stepup-speakout.org/Cordin...  I'm stretching--and a good one for me is the yoga \"Child's pose\"--with the arms out in front' www.youtube.com/watch?v=V22xxy...  AWS is a risk for LE, and sometimes there is LE associated with webbing that persists, that will get better when an expert PT treats the cords. Unique, this cord is just armpit to upper arm, when I first got it, it went down to my wrist, and I couldn't grip a pen. It's the acute phase, and it does hurt. A warm shower, some gentle overhead and child's pose stretches, some motrin, don't over do it with arm and if you can find a good PT who knows how to treat AWS, some stretching of the cords helps. In the Burt and White book, they describe skin lifting, where you lay back, and gently stretch the skin of your arm pit down to the opposite hip (that's the direction, obviously the skin barely moves) and try and hold for 90 seconds. And thinking of Erica's comments about the Lebed DVD--those moves could be really helpful, just don't do anything that really hurts.  Hope you feel better soon. I'm off to a warm shower. Kira ",

Gentle stretching, and some ibuprofen/naproxen--if you can take those medicines--should ease the pain. It does get better over time, but the cords are clotted off lymph vessels, and your lymphatic system is compromised while you're in the acute phase. It's very common, and it does get better.

It was from the UK health services. But, horror stories aside, I DO know axillary web, and there are cords, and they only hurt when you put stretch on them, and they're palpable. No skin changes. There's no rule that you can only have one thing at a time. Not everything that hurts or is a neuropathy is RSD. I went to look it up, and now RSD is now called complex regional pain syndrome, type 1  I'll ask Binney to answer your question about MLD with a wound. Gentle MLD should help wound healing. Just keep it covered, with a moist antibacterial dressing--like bactroban or bacitracin.  Doe, I hope neither biopsy shows anything of concern and that you heal quickly and get out of pain soon.

BMC Women's Health 2013, 13:6 doi:10.1186/1472-6874-13-6 Published: 13 February 2013 Abstract (provisional) Background Lymphedema is a highly prevalent condition in women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer. Lymphedema negatively affects the quality of life. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of lymphedema and associated factors in women treated for breast cancer in the municipality of Juiz de Fora. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study that evaluated 250 women who were being treated for breast cancer. Pre-screening of the sample by analysis of medical records was performed to select women who met the inclusion criteria as follows: women who had an operation more than 6 months ago; absence of active disease, locoregional or distant; the absence of functional change in the affected limb before surgery, which could lead to swelling of the limb; and simulating or masking symptoms of lymphedema, such as bursitis, tendonitis, and work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Women with bilateral breast cancer, absence of axillary intervention (partial or complete axillary dissection and/or SLN biopsy), active disease in the region, or lympho-venous alteration of the limb before surgery were excluded. Data were collected from the medical records of the selected cases, and they subsequently underwent an interview and a physical assessment. Results The prevalence of lymphedema was 44.8%. There were medical records on the presence of this condition in 5.4% of cases. With regard to shoulder joint mobility, restrictions on abduction movements, internal and external rotation, and anterior shoulder adduction were significantly associated with lymphedema. Variables, including the presence of seroma, vascular changes, time elapsed after surgery, episodes of redness in the extremities, and cuticle removal from the hand with pliers were considered as major associated factors for lymphedema (p<0.05). Conclusions The prevalence of 44.8% for lymphedema found in this study is considered to be relevant because it is a morbidity that produces psychological, physical, and functional damage in patients with this condition. The planning of health programs and services appropriate for the immediate postoperative treatment of women with breast cancer, and increasing the awareness of health professionals regarding the early diagnosis of lymphedema, can help minimize the morbidity of this disease.

When Jane Armer studied 250 women for 10 years (it's still ongoing) she found the 2 cm discrepancy at one point to be least sensitive--91% of women met that criteria at some point in the journey. She discarded all measurements in the first three months after surgery. She has a perometer and found that to be the most sensitive, but it doesn't work for hands... AW Stanton published a great article in Journal of Lymphoedema where he said that measurements should not be the only criteria, and subtle skin changes, history and loss of anatomical landmarks (smoothing of boney prominences) should be utilized. I wouldn't make their criteria, as I wrap and my bad arm is smaller due to atrophy and wrapping. Yet I clearly have LE. I go again and again to the Andrea Cheville quote on bc.org: http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/lymphedema/evaluation/diagnosis According to Andrea Cheville, MD, associate professor of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mayo Clinic, it\u2019s important to look at the whole picture: not just size and volume measurements, but the appearance of the limb or other body part. \u201cThere is no one value or standard you can use to say, \u2018OK, if you meet that you have lymphedema, and if you don\u2019t, well then you don\u2019t have it,\u2019\u201d says Dr. Cheville. \u201cFor example, there may be no size or volume changes in the arm, but you could have subtle hand swelling or pitting on the arm. So it\u2019s important not to be too locked into arm measurements alone, as that can create a false sense of security. You also need to be watching the arm and looking for the loss of what we call \u2018anatomic architecture\u2019 \u2014 an inability to see the veins and tendons in the arm as clearly, or less pronounced knuckles, or skin that is less wrinkled and therefore looks younger.\u201d I gave a talk on diagnosis in LE, and it's a clinical diagnosis.

I hope you can still enjoy the vacation. The advice I'm going to post below talks about deep breathing, and it's a powerful tool to get lymph moving. A major lymph vessel is below the diaphragm, and deep breathing will pump the lymph. Here's the page and the info: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#while%20waiting What to do While Waiting for Your First Appointment with a Qualified Lymphedema Therapist DO NOT try and treat this yourself!!! Proper professional treatment is essential to getting control of lymphedema and preventing its progression. Treatment can be expensive and inconvenient, but this condition is life long, potentially disfiguring, disabling and possibly life-threatening (if you get an infection known as cellulitis) so professional evaluation and treatment as soon as possible is essential. 1) Get evaluated promptly by your doctor to rule out other causes for the swelling in your hand/arm, and get a referral to see a well-trained lymphedema therapist; 2) Drink plenty of fluids -- staying well hydrated helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving freely; 3) Elevate the swollen arm or hand as much as possible during the day and on pillows at night; support the arm well so that it doesn't tire; 4) Several times a day pause and do some deep breathing -- this helps stimulate the largest lymph vessels in your body; 5) Raise hands over head as high as is comfortable for you, three times a day, and pump fists 20 times; 6) Call for medical help immediately if you have severe pain, redness, fever or feel ill; 7) You can try mild compression gloves by either Sammons Preston or Isotoner® Fingerless Therapeutic Gloves if your hands and/or fingers are swollen until your appointment with your lymphedema therapist. Be sure to bring them along to your appointment; 8) Do NOT use ACE wraps or any other wraps without the advice of your lymphedema therapist after your evaluation and your treatment plan is scheduled. Please let us know how you're doing. Kira",

The 71 women were rock solid stable, had custom garments made, had close follow up and immediate treatment of any flare by two qualified LE therapists. There were previous--and contentious--threads about the study---it's conclusions are limited, yet the conclusion in the NE Journal says \"weight lifting is safe for women with lymphedema\"--and really, the study only showed it was safe in carefully screened women, done carefully with custom garments, under close supervision and with immediate response to treatment.

Unfortunately, when you have a bout of cellulitis--and it sounds like you had a whopper case, it does some damage to the lymphatics. The most important thing is to have antibiotics on hand for rapid treatment if this ever shows up again. Bike riding could put pressure on your hands, but who knows if that was the cause. Just a thought, if you could stand it--my husband loves his recumbent bike, he just got a new one from Canada, from maxarya, and he adores it--he's a dentist and his hands were going numb from his traditional bike. maxarya.com/phpcode/index.php  We ordered it directly from them, as they have few dealers, but there's a lovely man in Alfred NY, the bicycle man who stocks all sorts of recumbents and offers advice.

Unless it easily fit a finger wrap underneath it. I got the jovipak very shortly after developing hand LE, which occured very shortly after surgery, and after about 4 months, saw a PT who told me to \"put it in my sock drawer\" and wrap. Ultimately she advised the Solaris, but most nights, wrapping is just more effective. Just more time consuming. My LE therapist who is a LMT who is LANA certified, Klose and Vodder trained and worked with the in patient group in NYC--with Robert Lerner MD-- (and calls Guenter Klose and the head of Vodder for questions) she says wrapping is the ideal, and the custom night garments are good for a break. She's mostly speaking about hand LE and leg LE that causes bad toe edema.  It's good to know about products and to be able to hear how they work for different people, IMO. Kira",

Gwinnett Sports Rehabilitation, Gwinnett Medical Center, 500 Medical Center Blvd, Suite 130, Lawrenceville, GA, USA. scannon@gwinnettmedicalcenter.org Abstract The two patients in this case series had experienced long-term difficulty controlling lymphedema at home. Both patients had used numerous home therapies, including older-generation intermittent pneumatic compression devices, without success. The Flexitouch system, an advanced pneumatic device, was prescribed to assist them with in-home efforts by providing therapy to their affected limbs in addition to the lower trunk area for the patient with lymphedema of the lower extremity; and the trunk, chest wall, and shoulder areas for the patient with lymphedema of the upper extremity. Both patients achieved successful home maintenance of lymphedema, as judged by limb volume, clinical observations, and subjective patient impressions, after incorporating the Flexitouch system. Neither patient experienced the deleterious effects (worsening genital edema; fibrotic cuff development) that they had experienced with the older-generation intermittent pneumatic compression devices they had previously used. Incorporating the Flexitouch system as part of maintenance may improve success for lymphedema patients who have previously struggled with in-home management. Kira",

Schmitz, PhD, MPH, from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Abramson Cancer Center in Philadelphia, and colleagues. \"Such guidance is often interpreted in a manner that deconditions the arm, increasing the potential for injury, overuse, and, ironically, lymphedema onset. Adherence to these precautions may limit physical recovery after breast cancer and, for some women, result in lost employment.\" The goal of the study was to compare onset of lymphedema after a 1-year weightlifting intervention vs a no-exercise control group among survivors at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) who were enrolled in the Physical Activity and Lymphedema trial. Between October 1, 2005, and February 2007, a total of 154 women surviving 1 to 5 years after diagnosis of unilateral breast cancer, with at least 2 lymph nodes removed and without clinical signs of BCRL at study entry, were recruited from the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Age range at study entry was 36 to 75 years. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group receiving no exercise, or to a weightlifting intervention, which included a gymnasium membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction followed by 9 months of unsupervised exercise. Study endpoints included incident BCRL, defined as increased arm swelling during the 12-month period with at least a 5% increase in interlimb difference, and clinician-determined BCRL onset. The equivalence margin was considered to be a doubling of lymphedema incidence. Follow-up data were collected through August 2008, with 134 participants completing follow-up evaluation at 1 year. In the weightlifting group, 8 (11%) of 72 women experienced incident BCRL vs 13 (17%) of 75 in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). In the subgroup of women who had removal of at least 5 lymph nodes, incident BCRL occurred in 7% (3/45) in the weightlifting intervention group and in 22% (11/49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). One woman in the weightlifting group and 3 in the control group had onset of clinician-defined BCRL (1.5% vs 4.4%; P for equivalence = .12). \"In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weightlifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema,\" the study authors write. Limitations of this study include lack of testing of superiority of weightlifting, necessitating additional research before it can be shown that weightlifting prevents lymphedema. \"The majority of breast cancer survivors do not have lymphedema; however, they alter the use of their arms and upper body activities out of fear of developing lymphedema,\" the study authors conclude. \"The findings from our trial should help clarify clinical advice to patients who have completed breast cancer treatment regarding the safety of resuming or beginning a weight lifting program. ... [E]ven with the finding of no harm, our results combined with previously published results for women with breast cancer-related lymphedema suggest that the many health benefits of weight lifting should now become available to all breast cancer survivors.\" The National Cancer Institute and the National Institutes of Health supported this study. BSN Medical provided in-kind support in the form of custom-fitted compression garments and the fitness centers where the weightlifting intervention was delivered discounted membership fees for study participants (YMCA of Philadelphia and Vicinity; Sisters in Shape; the Family YMCA of Burlington County, New Jersey; and the Community YMCA of Eastern Delaware County). The study authors have disclosed no relevant financial relationships. JAMA. Published online December 8, 2010. Abstract I think this is very clear, that the goal is to support careful strenghtening, and it does not appear to harm us--weightlifting is not treatment for LE, nor has it definitely been proven to prevent LE (the small group of women with >5 nodes may just be spurious)--but we don't need to be aftraid to use our arms, as long as we do it in a thoughtful way.

It is a drug that you want to be consistent with, and not take on as needed basis.   So many people report feeling a bit weird on it: my nurse uses it for her fibromyalgia and she felt really spacey for a while. My husband's office manager used it for her post-shingles pain, and she could only tolerate a small dose at bedtime.   I always think, go slow, go low--take the least amount that does the job, and a lot of the weird side effects should go away as you get used to it.   You can discuss with your doctor if he/she thinks taking it intermittantly is okay--it's not like you're likely to harm yourself medically, but it may less effective and you may perpetually be on the initial side effect impact. Lisa is right that when you take it all the time, they want you to wean off-- more of an issue for seizures and with higher doses.  You know what I especially liked about Andrea Cheville, from Mayo--okay, she's brilliant, funny, an amazing lecturer (she had a slide about lasers \" There may be tissue effects: SO WHAT???\"), was that she admitted she was fallible. She talked about all the times she \"had egg on my face\"--I admire someone so smart (and gorgeous to boot) admitting that she's only human.  Kira",

Jane and I attended Andrea Cheville's amazing talk on pain management in LE yesterday--2 hours of intensity. It's real and tough to treat: I know you worry about addiction, but there are \"adjunctive\" drugs: gabapentin, lyrica, elavil, even the SSRI's can work on this kind of pain.  Suzy, you are such an amazing woman, and as I think of you, I think of the myriad of trials that you've weathered in such a short time. Personally, I find I can get through some of this stuff with fight or flight energy, but the chronic stuff can just wear me down, and you loose your emotional reserve to deal with it. As Binney wrote, and Andrea Cheville (amazingly brilliant researcher from Mayo)--distraction is a key for pain management--it's why night times can be challenging. Pain is real and should be treated. The goal is to enhance our quality of life. (I'm surrounded by wired up kids who went to Disney, and I just spent 5 days locked in a hotel--? did I go to Florida--hearing great lectures on LE--got to meet some of the key researchers and get a private eval by an amaizing PT from Klose training. Binney went two years ago.) Suzy, this stuff is all real and valid and deserves to be treated. Your huge fan Kira",

Also the SNRI's are pain relievers as well, as are the benzodiapams (vaiums)--when I get organized, I'll try and scan the slide and see if it's readable. Neurontin/gabapentin is an anti convulant, they say \"mechanism of action unknown\" that was found to have pain relieving properties. It got a bad rep, editorial in NE Journal, because as the patent was expiring, despite no FDA approval for pain relief at the time, they had the drug reps pushing it hard on doctors. But, it works--and as the infamous Andrea Cheville says \" Sometimes you hit a home run\" with it. So, you are treating your pain with the antidepressant and the valium, and possibly the ambien. And, if we all agree that pain relief is very important, and chronic pain wears us down, and we're already worn down, it's a high priority to get pain relief. I have chronic vertigo, due to nerve damage from a virus in college and for years it was low level and about 6 or so years ago, in a yoga class, it acted up terribly. The neuro-otologist put me on klonopin, and I fought him tooth and nail, because I didn't want to be on addictive medication, but I finally realized it was the only way I could/can function--I've cut the dose back, and tried to cut it back further, and it flared again. Right before my bc diagnosis, it really acted up again, and I found some articles on the low dose SSRI's helping, so my ENT wrote for 10 mg of celexa--and the vertigo and nausea are so horrible off meds , so I just keep taking them. I used to feel so guilty and all my doctors have told me to \"get over it\". I know I get ashamed of taking these meds, but man, I hate drooling and consuming huge quantities of ginger, and not being able to walk a straight line. Kira",

I think, personally, you should do the best thing for you. You have non-union of a fracture and that's a tough thing to fix. You already got through a long tourniquet surgery with no lymphedema. Could you have an open discussion with the orthopedic surgeon on a surgical approach to your wrist that minimizes the risk? It's very weird how little things will tip some of us over the edge into LE: it was bug bites for me, washing the floor for someone else I know. But there was a study by AW Stanton in Lymphology, and he studied the whole lymph system, and women who got LE, tended to have less robust lymph systems from the start. Raili: any physician can write a prescription for lymphedema therapy, evaluate and treat as needed, ICD-9 code 457.0. It's considered a physical therapy prescription. If insurance needs you to have symptoms, just say you have tightness or heaviness. (Thanks for not thinking I was on a tear before, for some reason it felt like it..) Kira ",

(Did you have a colle's fracture?)   It's hard to sort out reactive edema from lymphedema, but you are at risk for lymphedema and the heat and swelling sound a lot like lymphedema. There's also a risk that the therapy, when it doesn't take into accout lymphedema, can make things worse. The fact that your arm is bothering you is another clue that this may be lymphedema--as the whole \"quadrant\"--arm/chest are at risk, and if your hand is traumatized, it can upset things further up the arm. I strongly suggest you see a qualfied LE therapist--I'll put in a link for how to find one--and if possible, try and get an OT who can do hand therapy  along with lymphedema evaluation. You'll need a referral from a physician. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... Lymphedema can be triggered by trauma--I initially got mine after bug bites, but various lymphedema therapists and women with lymphedema have also told me that when they use the techniques of lymphedema therapy with post-fracture swelling, it resolves so quickly, the doctors are shocked. Let me know how you're doing, and if you need additional information. Kira (My cast comes off 12/7 and then I start with the brace/ therapy--I'm contacting an OT who does LE therapy to see if she'll do the hand therapy vs. my surgeon's office.)",

If there is a component of lymphedema, then compression is indicated. Regional pain syndrome is very tough to treat--I don't believe that a compression glove will worsen it, as it is the body's over-reaction to an injury, and edema is part of the syndrome. I'm in a splint now, and my hand is sore--I'm still doing the OT exercises and seeing her once or twice a week. My lymphedema--present before the fracture--did act up, and I'm wrapping more and wearing day time compression more. Making slow progress. But, I think you need to have your health care providers give you guidance here: you have two separate issues going on and they need to address both of them. Since lymphedema swelling can cause pain, I would vote for wearing a compression glove--but it has to be well fitting, and I think you really need your doctors and nurses to give you a comprehensive plan. Please let us know how you're doing. Kira Norma Jean: that is plain outrageous that your insurance won't cover a glove you need--Juzo has just come out with a glove that wholesales at 45$--it's their 1100 line. Recently it was selling at brightlifedirect for 65$. The sizing is simpler than many gloves: small/medium/large/--but you need to have your lymphedema therapist check the fit of any glove you wear. Can you appeal the insurance decision?? You just had cellulitis for goodness sake!",

Other women can, so the key is to be individualized in your approach.   Deconditioning isn't good for us, but even Sherry Lebed Davis, of the Lebed method, blogged how she hired a PAL trained trainer, and her arms swelled no matter what she did when she tried weight lifting.   So, I'm glad it's worked for you, but there are others who won't tolerate weights, and even more women who won't have access to a well trained trainer who knows the PAL protocol.    But being fit is a goal we should all strife for.

Maybe.... I was on this mission to help Dana Farber improve the LE content on their website, and in the process, I contacted the their PT department at the Brigham, and the head told me her goal was \"zero percent LE--it should be a \"sentinel\" (reportable, I presume) incident.\" I was furious, as she's just denying the reality. I told her that no matter how careful everyone is, some people will get LE--and she insisted on \"you need to set high goals to achieve greatness\"--try denying our reality. One of things that really struck me when we were doing research for the SUSO site, was the comment that if you don't ask, you don't find. Women aren't asked about swelling and they're often not checked at their visits, so episodes of swelling or more permanent swelling gets ignored.

I used to work with a psychologist and she explained the concept of \"ego-dystonic\" to me: we all like to think of ourselves as honorable, good people and when we do something that conflicts with that internalized ideal, it's ego-dystonic and it's painful and threatens our sense of our self.   Causing harm to patients is ego-dystonic. Easier to re-frame it as \"saving your life, and sometimes there's some collateral damage in order to achieve the greater good.\"   Thank you for making me investigate sentinel event: www.nomoreerrors.com/sentinel.htm  If the head of PT at the Brigham is going to classify LE as a sentinel event it has serious implications. She didn't know the training of her therapists, but she had this goal of \"no more LE\". I tried to explain that her goal was impossible and a much more reasonable and helpful goal was 100% early identification of LE and early treatment. Over at Mass General they measure all women's arms with perometry: pre-op and all post-op visits and any indication that they're starting to get LE, they're sent to PT--that would be a good model to adopt.  As Binney says, so many opportunities to educate! Sure don't want to see LE as a sentinel event, because it would encourage even more denial and ignoring of the condition, if it's classified as a medical error. Kira ",

Since no one can agree on how to diagnose LE, and there has not been the kind of long term follow up on LE after SNB like there has been on ALND, it's kind of unclear. There was an article, right around the time the McLaughlin article with the 5% incidence came out, where they used a survey instrument and asked women about any swelling or other symptoms and come up with a much higher incidence of LE. One thing we discovered as we did research for the stepupspeakout site was that women are not routinely asked or evaluated about LE, so it's under-reported. Three of us who created the stepupspeakout site, we all have LE to various degrees, and we all had SNB. When it happens to you, it's 100% I was worried about LE, and asked the surgeon and was told I had a 7% chance. I did develop extensive axillary web syndrome, and an axillary seroma (both risks for LE) and in the midst of that high risk situation, got some bug bites that threw me over the edge into LE. I was actively seeing a PT for the cording--and she didn't tell me about risk reductions! My surgeon told me it wasn't her job--as she asked me what to do about the seroma--I made the wrong choice, leave it alone--it should have been aspirated, with prophylactic antibiotics. My rad onc told me that radiation never causes LE--as the field included my level 1 nodes... The misinformation and lack of information was staggering. So, there is a risk, but the odds are in your favor that it won't happen. And as other posters have noted, early intervention can stop progression--there was a British Medical Journal article about that recently, and unfortunately the only people who developed LE despite the PT intervention were those with extensive axillary web syndrome three weeks after surgery (my situation.) But, I did get early treatment, and it did respond, and I'm working on putting it into its proper place in my life. I work in rad onc and while the head rad onc measures arms, he doesn't inquire about transient swelling, and doesn't \"get\" that LE fluctutates. So, he's aware of LE, but doesn't understand its treatment. I have a packet for patients, of the NLN risk reduction guidelines, and the Lance Armstrong handout and I've interviewed the LE therapists in the area and have found several that are well trained and work well with the patients. If you don't ask, you don't find it. Sorry for the long ramble. Here's the link to the Lance Armstrong paper on LE, written by Jane Armer PhD http://www.livestrong.org/site/c.khLXK1PxHmF/b.2660675/ Here's a link to the page on our web site about what we wished our doctors knew: www.stepup-speakout.org/what_w...  You are wise to be concerned, and the odds are that it will never happen, but with your knowledge, you will be in a great position to recognize subtle early symptoms (achey, swollen, tight) and head it off.
