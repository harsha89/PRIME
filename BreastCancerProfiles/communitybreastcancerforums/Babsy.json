With the other bc forumsthat I'm on there doesn't appear to anyone diagnosed with LM with brain mets. Good to talk to people who understand. For those who are suspected, hopefully they're wrong. It's amazing the other things we can catch, Lyme disease, well at least they've correctly diagnosed it. Cyber hugs to you all ((()))) x  ",

It's hard to release the stress that has built up and it's sometimes like holding your breathe to the next thing that raises its head. I remember screaming in my head when I was having my MRI brain scan, I wished I could have done it out loud!! Maybe I will next time, ha ha.",
