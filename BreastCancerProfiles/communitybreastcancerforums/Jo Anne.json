Surgeon told me on Thursday (5/29) that the radiology oncologist and he had spoken and the radiologist wanted him to 'shave' more healthy tissue from an area of 'clean margin' that was only 0.1 mm away. Told surgeon he wouldn't radiate me without more of a 'clean margin'. I have lots of support, and they are coming out of the wood work to help! I hope everyone is having a lovely weekend. Today the weather is just loverly! Jo-Anne",
