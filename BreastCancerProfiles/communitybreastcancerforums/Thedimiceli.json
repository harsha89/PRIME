    "Content": "Thedimiceli wrote: For the past eight weeks or so, I have been having rather severe pain in my right breast. I figured it was probably hormones, but became a little more concerned when I noticed bloody discharge on my bra. I had a doctor's appointment already scheduled , so I brought it up. He did a breast exam and said there is considerable thickening of the breast tissue under my nipple. I have also noticed my breast has been hot to the touch, and is even changing in shape. He wanted me to get the diagnosic mammogram the week he saw me, but I rescheduled out of fear. The test is tomorrow and I am I terrified. Not sure if this is worth noting, but I have had zero energy lately. I can barely get out of bed in the morning, in fact sometimes I am just too tired to even function and sleep up to 20 hours in a day. My memory had gone to complete sh*t. I just need some reassuring words. This is my first post, hopefully I did it right. Log in to post a reply",
