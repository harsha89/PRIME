A couple weeks ago, I felt a lump that is about 2 cm. Since then I have had a mammo/US both with BI-RADS 5, highly suspicious for malignancy. On Friday, I had a US guided core biopsy. I meet with the breast surgeon Thursday of this week and have an MRI scheduled for Friday. I've been doing a lot of research on BI-RADS and honestly I am freaking out. I've been trying to keep it together. While, for me things are moving very quickly....now that I am awaiting results time seems to be standing still. I know that 80% of biopsies come back negative. I wonder though out of that 80% how many were BI-RADS 5?",
