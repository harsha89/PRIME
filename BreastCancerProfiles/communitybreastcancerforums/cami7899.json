But her lumpectomy will be en 4 more weeks. so Hope the second Biopsy show same thing and not DCSI anyway what i read here if is DCIS still early i hope so. My mom get her mammogram every year since 2003 she is 53 and this is first time show something on her Mamo, so when she get her in Agust 2008 don't show nothing but now in January 2009 show this lump, she take 16 month later due to insurance problems. thank you everybody , this group is so great.",
