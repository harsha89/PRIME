(My treatments have just started...going on third week of Arimidex, no SE's to date.) I will drink a lot of water (2 water bottles full) before getting the shot, but still, I'm--well, I'm a baby! My oncology nurse said if I like, she can spray that area of my arm with lidocaine before the shot. I was wondering if anyone has done this, and if it helps appreciably with the pain of the shot?
