      "Content": "Sep 24, 2008 12:53PM - edited Sep 26, 2008 08:10PM by jaspersmom Thanks for your insight. My father did pass away from cancer - probably small cell lung but he was not a smoker (it spread by the time they found it). His sister, my paternal aunt died of lung cancer, she was a smoker. So there is cancer on his side too.  My mom did have a hysterectomy and probably her ovaries out in her 50's.  ANyway, with this post I'm kind of 'trolling' for others with the same mutation. I hope you are right though that it's not a deleterious mutation.  Cheers!",

I have one - it's called \"L204\"  It is said to be of  unknown significance, and I'm trying to find others who might have the same mutation. The Myriad folks Genetics people told me it's pretty rare, and while they can't categorize it as 'irrelevent' they don't believe it's a 'bad' mutation. All of this means I'm in a gray area. Any others out there with this one? Log in to post a reply",

Yes a lot of chatter and frustration similar to mine. Anyway, am hoping that this thread will pick up someone else with our mutation. I say 'our' because my sister has it too. My mom passed away (no bc) and one maternal aunt who had bc in late life has also passed away. The Myriad folks say that if they change the conclusion on our mutation they'll notify our doctors. Well, here's hoping!  Yes it's L204F you're right by the way.",
