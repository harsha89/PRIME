I was a little sore, but could handle it with Advil. Could have taken a few more days off, but since my job is not strenuous, and I wanted to move some, decided to go back. My surgeon used the DaVinci robotic technnique. For me, this was so much \"better\" than a traditional hysterectomy, which I liken to the C-sections I've had, which were much worse recovery-wise. Plan for an aide the first 3 days at least, up to a week just in case. Also, if you are taking narcotic pain meds for more than just a few days, that will also influence your decision. Best of luck to you.  ",

I initiated the contact with the breast specialist. Due to a family history of ovarian and breast cancer, I had a proph. BSO and hysterectomy in Nov., then started tamox. in Dec. (The surgeon felt since the ovaries were being removed, might as well take the uterus too, since I'm done having children, and would be taking tamox). Some night sweats, but no other symptoms so far. I'm also on a rotating 6 mo. schedule of MRI/mammo. The surgeon also recommended a lowfat diet, exercise, and minimal to no alcohol. Already an exercise junkie, I recommend it wholeheartedly, both for psych. and physical benefits. Best to you.  ",
