      "Content": "Jul 7, 2017 12:43PM - edited Jul 7, 2017 01:05PM by Lsunshine I am new to this group so please be patient with me. I have had fluid filled cysts for over 2 years. I have had mamo U/S had them drained etc. I had a cyst on my right breast that was the size of a small apricot that was pushing my nipple down and made me very self conscious so I decided to have a breast augmentation lift and remove that cyst. That is when we found out I have LCIS on April 17/2017. I have had MRI and U/S. I have seen 2 BS my options are every 6 months MRI/mamo take tamoxifen and wait and watch because my breasts look like Swiss cheese I would probably have biopsys every time also. Also when the specialist has a hard time doing a breast exam due to cysts how do they expect me to know the difference in lumps. Or second option BMX. My husband said it best \"we can live without boobs we can't live without you.\" So I have decided for myself and my family bmx is the best option with reconstr. I am scheduled for aug 28. I just cannot go through test after test and being poked and the uncertainty. I am nervous about the surgery and recovery. I'm sure that there isn't a person out there that has said I really would like to have a bmx. Any help from someone who has been there is greatly appreciated. I am so impressed by the posts I have read and the support everyone has for each other on this board. It has helped me to just read all of the stories. So many strong people on this site truly just ready other posts",

Mostly about recovery, but I can't say im not a little scared about the surgery also and then there are the pathology results. Then not knowing exactly how to prepare for bmx and expanders and recovery need to go shopping Big deep breaths and a day at a time right.",

I want to be here for a long time for my family who mean the world to me. I love boating and I am active I love boxing. Can I do all of those things after. Sometimes I wish I would wake up and it be a bad dream. Then I read these posts and see you guys battling more then myself. So many thoughts I know it's nerves but so many thoughts. I just wish I could punch cancer right in the chops and make it disappear for all of us",

Sometimes I wonder if the reason the doctors want us to do the monitoring is so they can get data from us. With lcis having so little information studies etc. I also was givin a number which I think they just pull numbers out but they said 70% I have no history of bc in my family. But I also have no history of nausea when pregnant or csections but I had both of those also. So for me it's not a risk I'm willing to take. It looks like you will have surgery a few days before me mine is the 28th. Are you having skin and nipple sparing? Are you doing reconstruction with TE at the same time as your surgery that's my plan",

Tried waking my husband sound asleep. Nurse came in 1 20 min later bed buzzer wasn't plugged in ouch. The left breast was more complicated then my right with lcis took 2 centinal nodes from right side. Went for follow up today removed 2 drains. Ps was very happy there were a few small spots around the nipple he was worried about but they are healing. Bs said pathology came back nodes were clear. Lots of lcis in both breasts lots of scar tissue and numerous benign cysts. There was one very tiny spot of ilc imaging wouldn't have detected. Bs said no treatment is required. Have to go see an oncologist on Thursday to confirm. I have numbness in my hand and arm but she said that should come back. I'm tired of pain killers so they said only take them if I need them.
