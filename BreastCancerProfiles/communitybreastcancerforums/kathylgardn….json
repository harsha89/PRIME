I'm sure your hairdresser is just thinking of you and the safest route as even semi-permenant color has chemicals.  Most of my clients initallly had me use a henna type product, this comes in many colors and is a vegetable based product, hince no chemicals. I can sure feel for you, I am waiting for my next mastectomy as now after only four months I have cancer in the remaining breast. I think you will need to ultimatly decide what you feel comfortable with and if you feel ok with chemicals then that is your decision. I'm sure your hairdresser will want you to sign a release of liablitly if they do procede with coloring your hair.  Hope this helps with the decision process, best of luck in your health and hair care needs. Sincerely, Kathy",
