Although we do not live together, he is very supportive. I have not started any treatments yet. My doc says I only need radiation. My first consult with the oncologist is Oct 20th. then I will start the radiation. I am already on pain meds for my back so I haven't felt much pain after the lumpectomy. Not looking forward to the radiation but atleast I don't have to do chemo.",
