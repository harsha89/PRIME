I finally went in today for my doctor to look at it and she said there's a thickened lump where the pain is and she thought it felt like a milk duct. The pain is not shooting, it's just a small painful area. Also, I've never been pregnant or obviously breastfed. Anyhow, I have a mammogram and ultrasound scheduled for 2 weeks out. I'm not \"worried\" per se but I am definitely curious as to what it could be. Thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
