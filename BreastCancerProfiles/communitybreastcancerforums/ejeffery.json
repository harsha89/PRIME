This morning was the first time I had heard it and of course was anxious about it. This past month has sped by me like a whirlwind. I was diagnosed after a routine screening mammogram and have had several things going on, ending with surgery on Dec 7th for lumpectomy. I had two tumors. They were both removed and had clean margins. I had four lymph nodes removed and they were clear. I am waiting to hear about the radiation concult. I am anxious. Did having radiation affect your working life? ",
