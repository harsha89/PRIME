Margins did end up being clear so I guess I can be positive about that. I'm guessing 4 rounds of AC and 4 rounds of T. But a new wrench has been thrown into the plan. Biopsy path showed HER2- and surgical path showed HER2 equivocal. Awaiting final FISH results. I might end up being triple positive. How are you doing?",

I also cannot give shots to myself but when the nurse gave it to me last week, it looked really easy.

I guess this will be another thing that I will throw caution to the wind to, because I love spray tans! Argh! FUGLY disease is so flippin' right! Jennifer, Michelle & vtEllen - glad I am not the only one with the stupid hyperpigmentation thing. I read online that it could be a side effect. When I whined to my onc about it and complained about how ugly it was, she just kind of looked at me and said \"Hyperpigmentation is a side effect\" and that was the end of that! No sympathy from her, LOL!  Michelle - I'm so sorry about your friend :-( vtEllen - Ugh, I have a hard time biting back the \"Yeah, RIGHT!\"s when people say I look good. Give me a break, I know I don't look good. I know people mean well but... Taylor - The Rad Onc told me that the school of thought on rads with women who have had mastectomies has come back around again. I guess they used to do rads on everyone; then the thought changed and people with mastectomies and only 1-3 positive nodes didn't need it; now it has changed back to the way it was before. He said he would talk over my case with \"the Board\" but felt confident they would all agree for me to have rads, at least 28 with a possible 5 more \"boosters.\" He said with the tissue expanders, he might forego with boosters. But I don't think this is something that is necessarily US vs Canada; all the docs are different. I met another woman on here in the US who went through all of this last year and she was just like me: double mast and 2 positive nodes and she was not given rads. I'm glad to hear that some of you haven't really had nail issues! Hurrah! ",

I also my chemo training last week and I felt like I already knew everything from all the research I had been doing. It was kind of a general class and I was the youngest one there and the only one with breast cancer. I asked the nurse who taught the class some specific questions after it was over but she couldn't really answer them fully because she doesn't typically work with breast cancer patients in her rotation and referred me to my MO's nurse. I mean, it was a decent class but I didn't feel like I learned anything.  Good luck on deciding on the clinical trial! I hope you're healing welling from the AND and have a great day! ",

LOL. Michelle, I'm so sorry about your friend   So...my hair. It's gone, the hair replacement place shaved it off on Friday. I have taken it really hard. Today is the first day I dared to go to work. The wig is really difficult for me to get used to, as well as the reflection of the bald alien I see in the mirror. I'm not in love with the wig and I feel like it looks really obvious. Le Sigh. ",

I am actually getting another wig ordered for me because the one I originally got does not match my hair's texture. Totally wrong. It looks dry and overprocessed so I went back to the wig place and they agreed and have ordered me another one. That was half the problem. But looking at myself in the mirror bald is hella creepy. Taylor - AC is *supposed* to be tougher. They say Taxol is easier but who knows? With Taxol I guess you have to worry about neuropathy. It's in the same family as Taxotere but the side effects are possibly a little different...? vtEllen - Glad you are feeling OK today, minus the early bone pain. That's great that your counts went up on their own!!! Chrys - I know, I am doing the mani/pedis at my own peril. I just can't have every girlie thing taken away from me. I always have nice nails and I will continue to do so :-) I go once my WBC count has rebounded. ",

And chemo is SO DIFFERENT from surgery. Not to jinx myself here, but surgery for me was a breeze (BMX with TEs). I recovered pretty quickly and healed up well. The TEs don't even bother me. But with chemo I don't know what to expect each time. Plus, the hair loss is a constant, physical, visible reminder that we're going through it. I really feel that the hair loss is the hardest part; way more so than my chest. It SUCKS so bad!!! My onc said that the emotions are also a big part of this process. You're doing great, we're all doing great, and we WILL get to the other side of this. We WILL get our lives back. I know it, even if it doesn't seem that way right now. <3 Kasi ",

I found out that antibiotics don't always get all of the bacteria, hence the recurrence. I tried this thing called D-Mannose...it's a natural sugar that washes out any clinging bacteria. I took it after my last UTI, it cleared it up and I never had one again. No joke. My last one was in 2003.

I went in cocky and figured it wouldn't touch me (well, not quite that cocky!). The actual infusion was completely uneventful. My Mom and best friend were there, we just talked the whole time. I sucked on ice chips. Got home and felt sleepy so I took a nap. I woke up from my nap about 3 hours after my infusion was over and I felt sick as a dog. Headache, nausea, diarrhea. Didn't throw up but I could have; I consciously made myself not so I could keep the meds down. Called the on-call doctor and asked if I should be feeling so sick so soon. He said not usually but everyone is different. Took all my meds and upped the amount of Ativan as the doc suggested. Slept off and on throughout the night. Woke up Friday a bit better but still queasy. Kept taking the meds as I was supposed to. Drove myself and my Mom to get my Neulasta shot. They ended up giving me fluids there because I told them I had diarrhea. I didn't really think I needed fluids because I was drinking so much water. But the fluids made me feel better. Friday night I drove and picked up my bro from the airport. I had no bone pain from the Neulasta. Saturday, Sunday, Monday I was ok. Didn't feel like myself but I wasn't bed bound. I walked the dogs and did yoga each day. Tuesday I felt like myself again. The only thing that is lingering is my distaste for food. Hope that helps! ",

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2011 12:47PM - edited Aug 13, 2011 12:50PM by Kasi Cupcakies - From what I understand, and I am by no means a doctor or good at biology, different types of chemos do different things. Some chemos physically go right to the cancer cells and kill them. Other chemo drugs mess with the DNA directly so that mutated (cancer cells) cannot grow and reproduce and make them kill themselves. Different chemos attack cells in different phases of their life cycles (all cells are programmed to be born, reproduce, and die. Cancer cells are mutated and do not follow this programmed death, which is why tumors form and the cancer spreads. They don't f*cking die and they reproduce too fast for the immune system to kill them). Time between each treatment allows the healthy cells to regenerate (with the help of the Neulasta or Neupogen shot for the bone marrow) and if the chemo is doing its job, the cancer cells will not regenerate. My guess is that in the first few days of each chemo is when all the \"damage\" is done to the good and bad cells and then comes the aftermath of that damage days later (i.e., hair falling out, low white blood cell count). Here's what the different types of chemos do (taken from various sources): Alkylating agents directly damage DNA to prevent the cancer cell from reproducing. So this is the Cytoxan portion for those of us getting it. Anthracyclines are anti-tumor antibiotics that interfere with enzymes involved in DNA replication. These agents work in all phases of the cell cycle. Thus, they are widely used for a variety of cancers. This group includes the Adriamycin (red devil) for those of us getting it . Carboplatin is also grouped here due to how it functions, although it is a metal salt. Mitotic inhibitors are often plant alkaloids and other compounds derived from natural products. They can stop mitosis or inhibit enzymes from making proteins needed for cell reproduction. These drugs work during the M phase of the cell cycle (the Mitosis phase, when the cell divides and makes more), but can damage cells in all phases. This group includes the taxanes, for those of us getting Taxotere or Taxol. Monoclonal antibodies are a relatively new type of \"targeted\" cancer therapy (and not technically a \u201cchemo\u201d). Antibodies are part of the immune system. Normally, the body creates antibodies in response to an antigen (such as a protein in a germ) entering the body. The antibodies attach to the antigen in order to mark the antigen for destruction by the body's immune system. This is for those of us who are HER2 positive and getting Herceptin; it's helping us get more antibodies to those overexpressing oncogenes (the HER2) and kill them. Hope that helps...??? ",

Madismommy - I have heard that emend is the best (I got that in my IV), so if you have that as a take home med, you should be all set. My at home stuff was the stupid steroid, Compazine and Ativan. The compazine did not cut it for me so I asked for Zofran. And even though I felt nauseous, I never threw up. I took all my meds as directed and that's probably why. vtEllen - My plan is to take a Zofran when I leave the infusion to try to combat the nausea from the get-go this time. I was also told that I would be fine for awhile just from what they gave me in the IV, but that did not prove to be true for me either. About the oncotype test, I'm on the fence on whether or not to ask for it, just to know what my number is (even though I have to get chemo). What if the number is high? Then I will worry even more about recurrence. But if it was low, that might give me some peace of mind. Ugh, don't know. Hope all of you are having a fabulous Wednesday!!!!!! ",

Then the Adriamycin, then the Cytoxan, and then Ativan last as a push through my port,. I had a scrip for steroids at home that I was to take once every 12 hours starting the night of chemo just just 5 times. My infusions are on Thursdays so the last time I would take a steroid at home was Saturday night. On my 4th AC last week, I didn't even take the final steroid on Sat night, didn't need it. I got my AC every two weeks 4 times and I just finished my 4th last Thursday. On to Taxol, wahoooo! Halfway done. November 10th is going to be one of the best days of my life!!!

And that is completely individual. Some people just might have more pathways for the lymph to pass, so losing a few nodes isn't a big deal.

I called them the next business day (Monday) just to see if the results were ready even though they said Tuesday (they were ready on Mon, btw).

And michelleg1122, I am so happy for you and your b9 result - that is just great news! :-) So...IDC grade III, estimated to be 4 cm. ER+ & PR+, HER2-. I'm so peeved that I won't be able to take my beloved Seasonale anymore and my lovely 4 periods a year. Ah, the little things that I should have appreciated more. We don't have all the info yet on the tumor that we need and I haven't met with the whole team just yet. Went over the pathology results at the breast care center. When she said that the tumor was an estimated 4 cm I said \"That means I will probably be started on chemo to shrink the tumor.\" Again, we don't have all the info but they said that would be most likely. So not what I wanted. Why do I read about all these celebrities like Christina Applegate and Cynthia Nixon that just get away with a lumpectomy/mastectomy and just rads. No chemo. Grrrrrr. And Suzanne Somsers who refused chemo. The chemo is just really the hardest thing for me to think about right now. I have no doubt that I will kick this cancer's butt and be done with it but the chemo is just making me so depressed...ugh, why does this have to happen during my summer? (I live in Maine and for me, the best time of the year is June, July, & August). Thanks again everyone and HUGE hugs to you all. ",

The MRI showed another area (aside from the tumor) that is suspicious of DCIS behind the nipple. I can have that other area biopsied just to be sure but if it is positive for DCIS, I am no longer a candidate for a lumpectomy because it would be near impossible to try to get all the cancer and surrounding tissue and be left of a decent looking breast. The team at my city's hospital is leaning toward mastectomy, followed by chemo and rads. They did initially think chemo first in the interest of breast conservation. The MRI did not show any auxiliary lymph node involvement. I know that it does not show microscopic invasion but I am still encouraged by it. I have a CT scan scheduled as well and my blood is being sent out for BRCA testing. Tomorrow I head to Tufts Medical Center in Boston for the 2nd opinion.  Hope everyone is having a great day! ",

Drove myself and my mom to my shot and also picked up my bro from the airport. So it first felt like it was the repercussions of a bad bender but now I am pretty much fine. And no bone pain from the Neulasta. I asked the on-call dr on Thurs nite if it was normal to get hit so quickly after the infusion and he indicated that it was kind of rare but everyone is different.

I hope that everyone else who had treatment this week is feeling good! Hugs to all of you! Summergirl - I am going to check out that Facebook group. I think my docs would have been onboard with me doing the cold caps but, honestly, it looked like so much work and I would have had to bring my own \"team\" to help me. Ice, dry ice, switching caps, not getting burned by the dry ice, needing people to help you fasten them on, etc. I mean, I do love my hair but all the work just sounded so exhausting. Did I really want to be hauling around a cooler? I dunno. I go back and forth on the decision every day. But, seeing how tired I am and sick I got those first few days, I couldn't imagine fussing with the caps. Maddismommy - My onc said that I could get fills during chemo. I only wanted to be a B cup (that's my size, didn't want to go bigger) and my TEs were filled halfway at surgery. So I only needed a few more fills and I was done with them before I started chemo. I don't see why, if you get filled the day before your infusions when your counts are at their highest, you can't. But I am not a doctor and they all say different things anyway :-) Aimska - I wish we lived closer too :-( But JFK is just a short Jet Blue plane ride from Portland, ME  Day 8. Hair still not coming out yet. Scalp not feeling funny. Just waiting for that other shoe to drop this coming week... vtEllen & MaryjRN - How are you guys feeling? No fever here. I did decide to work from home today, though - there are 150 people at my company and I did not want to risk the germs. You guys, when all of this is over next year, it would be so cool if we could plan a meetup somewhere. I know we're from all over the place but I think that would just be so neat to meet all of you in person when this stuff is behind us all and we have kicked cancer's BUTT!

My onc asked me if I wanted to be in a trial study to see if it really does help but I already take it every day so that left me ineligible to be in the study.  Theresa - Hope you are feeling better as the day goes on. That's exactly how I felt, too: out of sorts. Not like myself. I had my first AC chemo exactly a week before you and I felt like myself again by the following Tuesday.

A couple days ago, I had the windows down in my car and was feeling the wind through my hair and I shed a few tears about that, but then I was better. vtEllen - My drips yesterday went in this order: Aloxi, Emend, Decadron, Adriamycin (red devin), Cytoxan, and Ativan (the Ativan was just a quick push through my port). My takehome drugs are Decadron (I have to take it the first night of chemo and then 4 more times every 12 hours, so the last time I take the steroid is Saturday night), Zofran (which I popped as soon as I got home from the infusion), and Ativan. I take two Ativan at night before I sleep.  Thanks for the well wishes everyone - I still feel SO MUCH better than last time. Went on an hour and 10 minute walk with my Mom and our dogs this morning and now I'm doing some work from home. And the best part is that I am not even going to need fluids this time, just the shot. Yay!! I don't want to jinx myself but I felt so crappy last time that I am so happy right now!  I hope you are all feeling good today and hanging in there! You're all so awesome!  ",

The night after my first Taxol infusion, the palms of my hands turned all red like a sunburn and the skin even felt like it was sunburned. It hurt to close my hands in a fist. It went away in about 48 hours. When I went to my next infusion, they scaled back the Taxol amount by 20% (which I was just fine with). Maybe ask about that to lessen the issues with feet and hands? Missey - You're almost there! Woohoo! To answer your question, I do not consider myself sick. Before I was diagnosed, I was never sick. Didn't even get a cold that winter. People in my office had bronchitis and sinus infections. Didn't get a dang thing. I don't even FEEL sick right now. So far, Taxol has been a dream for me. I'm actually running again. I don't want to jinx this, but other than the hair loss, I almost feel like myself pre-BC (just a little more tired and a non-stop runny nose). I don't want anyone to think of me as \"sick\" just because I have cancer. I'm just dealing with this little setback and looking forward to the days when my treatments are over and my hair is growing back in! ",

Radiation if the nodes are positive and/or clear margins were difficult to achieve. Ugh. Boston made it seem like if I really wanted to try to save the breast, it could be done with some wizadry. For my peace of mind, I am not interested. Get 'em both off. Chemo is the hardest pill for me to swallow still. But my tumor is grade 3. So chemo it is. I hope you guys are all having a great week!

Maybe bring a snack? I ate right before so I didn't eat anything during. OH AND...is anyone else's nose running nonstop?? Sometimes if I bend over, it literally drips out of my nose.

For example, according to real people AND books, it's common for your hair to grow back in gray for awhile, even if you weren't gray to start. The color often times come back, but it can come in a yucky gray color. When I asked an onc about this (I think I've asked 2 of them), they both said \"I've never heard of that.\" Grrrrr! Yes, it happens, I wish they would just admit some of this stuff. And the fact that Taxol can cause neuropathy...asked my onc about that and she was like \"No, we would adjust the drugs if that was a side effect, and it's not permanent.\" Yes, it is permanent for some people.  So Chrys - yes, I would think that what you're going through could be SE from the Taxotere. I'm so sorry, I hope that it gets better. I've read that taking L-Glutamine (a supplement) can help. I'm planning on taking it through my Taxol rounds.",

I know I never think those thoughts when I see someone in a scarf but I am my own worst critic. Perhaps now is the time to let the vanity die. Or at least be less vain. ha!!!! Chava - Thanks for the links about fasting. I don't know that I dare to attempt it. Me without food is not good and I feel better when I am getting the infusions and I have stuff in my stomach. I am also doing acupuncture, just once a week though. I think that it is really helping me. I don't feel 100% like myself but I am functioning pretty normally without too many SEs. Seriously, the constant faucet of my nose is the only really bad thing (and bald head, lol). Taylor - I had a double mast and I still have to get radiation (2 positive nodes). The way the RO explained it is that the chemo is good insurance against the cancer going to distant sites but not as good in the local area. So the radiation takes care of the possibility of local recurrence. I wasn't happy about having to do the radiation but I am going with it. ",

And good question about how they determine who gets what chemo. My initial HER2 test was equivocal so there was talk that if I was HER2 positive, I would be getting 6 rounds of TCH every three weeks, But when the FISH test came back HER2 negative, it was AC and Taxol. They said that I was going to be treated really aggressively so that's a really aggessive regimen? No clue. I see that some women who are triple negative get the same chemo regimen as me so that's what makes me think it's a really aggressive treatment since TN is considered a very aggressive cancer...? Honestly, no clue. I am probably being over treated but I am fine with that. I have many, many years of living left to do. ",

Great job on taking the bull by the horns! Jen - Congrats on Taxol #1; the end is in sight!!! DebinUtah - Hahaha! I cracked up about the \"recipe\"; no kidding, huh? Is someone cooking this stuff up in their meth labs? LOL.  That does not put me at ease at all. Sheesh. I'm sorry I haven't been keeping up with everyone and commenting directly! Love to you all!

Hugs to all of you, September is almost over, we are getting there surely (albeit too slowly, hahaha!) The last and final round of AC kicked my patootie. It is Day 11 since that round and I FINALLY FEEL BETTER. No more sore mouth, no more sore throat, no more headache and head pounding when I get up to stand, no more feeling like I have the dang flu. I think it's fitting to finally feel better today because it's my 32nd birthday! This definitely isn't a birthday to go down in the books, LOL. I asked Hubs for a time machine for my birthday  ",
