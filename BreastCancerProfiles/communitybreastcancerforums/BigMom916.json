I have little to no appetite, nausea, stomach pain, weight loss and fatigue I had spinal irradiation completed last week and now I am experiencing burning throughout my throat and into my stomach. It hurts to swallow. I decided to stop the Xeloda today and will discuss this with my doctor. She keeps telling me I \"look great\" but don't think she is paying any attention to my symptoms. I feel terrible. I feel much sicker than I did before treatment. Has anyone had trouble taking Xeloda? Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm looking for quality of life on a treatment ...Help!

She says\"you look good\" and I hold back on saying but I feel lousy and here is why. Visits are fast paced and she tends to be defensive over any questioning. I am going to try to see her this week and be more clear. Thanks",
