Along with the tumor they found a separate area with ADH associated with calcifications several cm away from the tumor. I am trying to decide if I should have a lumpectomy to remove just the tumor, surrounding tissue and the area of calcification that they can see. Along with 6 weeks of radiation. Or the other option is to have a mastectomy with reconstructive surgery which would remove the tumor and all the ADH calcification areas with no radiation. Does anyone have any experience dealing with ADH calcifications? They said there was no cancer found in the calcification biopsies but that the cells looked like they were organizing differently which is signs of pre-cancer. I'm 49 years old and would like to make a decision based on quality of life and not worrying all the time about the cancer recurring. Unfortunately, I'm the type that worries about every little ache and pain being something major. Ironic that my BC was caught on a annual 3D mammogram. Would love the opinions of other IDC BC survivors! Log in to post a reply",

I think I have decided to have the mastectomy for my cancer/ADH breast (Right) but am torn if I should also remove the healthy breast. I too, do not want to worry all the time about cancer returning in the left breast. I had a genetic testing done yesterday since my dad was diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer at age 47 and my 1st cousin has advance stage ovarian cancer. The ADH risk factor scares me so that is why I decided on a mastectomy for my right breast. How did your surgery go? Was the expander process painful? Are you happy with the silicone implants? ",
