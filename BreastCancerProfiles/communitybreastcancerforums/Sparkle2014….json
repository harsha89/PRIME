I have Inv Ductal & DCIS in Right Breast - I wanted to avoid Radiation as my skin is very sensitive, I have had many many sun burns on my chest and have Rheynaud's Syndrome (I get very cold and hands, feet turn white and when I go in and out of cold air or very hot temperatures I get either freezing or my hands and feet turn bright red) -- had that since teens, not harmful - I just always have sweater with me in my Big Handbag!  and always wear lots clothes in winter,,,  anyways - I met with the Radiation Oncologist right after I met with the Breast Surgeon to discuss even if I was a candidate for Radiation - I also have had several squamous cell carcinomas (from too much time in the sun) and those happen to be above my breasts on my chest - - and fair Scottish skin and lots damage - so he met with me - went over my family history and my own health history and he could see how cold I was in his office in May - they had the AC on high and I had sandals on and he said wow your feet really are purple/blue and that concerns me with how sensitive your body is - I kept my mouth shut (as I already had in mind going with Mastectomy vs a lumpectomy + Radiation as everyone I know or have heard that begins with  Lumpectomy & Radiation ends up getting more something 2-3 yrs later and needs the Mastecomy and reconstruction anyways,,,,  (I know some women do the Lump/Rad and never have a recurrence however, I know about 8 women who had that first and all wound up needing the Mastectomy so in my opinion - it was best for me to just give me peace of mind that the dense breast tissue that has given me issues in past - 7 yrs ago had scare for BC that was false alarm and had sterotactic biopsy then and then same area in 2014 - two biopsies - and DX of IDC/DCIS.  so I was leaning to MX on one side from the beginning in my own head,,  He came right out and said well I think your best option would be a Mastectomy of the Right and if you would get more peace of mind removing both, fine - but I think you'll be safe just removing the RT as your left seems to have no indication of any cancer in it - this way you keep the Left, have a natural breast and feeling and do reconstruction on Right and don't even consider Lumpectomy & radiation as Radiation probably would burn you and more risk blisters and itchy and all the Radiation issues nor need to go in 5 days week for it for 6 wks...  (I was glad he confirmed that my gut instinct felt I would not do well in radiation and glad he advised what I was thinking was best as well). anyways - the one ???  left was in my tissue sample from the June surgery - the Breast Surgeon did Sentinel Lymph node biopsy (only took out the SN) - said looked good so felt no need to remove any others...  that the tracer dye went straight to that one node she removed. - so that was good news as if was in it - then more nodes would have had to be taken out and examined and I would def need chemo so the ONCA test gives ONC the score - a prediction based on your stage, grade, tumor size and tissue samples and age of DX and gives a recurrance score so if it is on the lower side - maybe under 25 or somewhere near there,,  then DR may say ok Chemo would not benefit you - but if recurrance score is higher side - say 48, they would likely say yes Chemo is in your cards...  will help you.  Mine was 9 - so they called and said good news - No Chemo!  so that was a blessing.   I don't know if every insurance pays for the ONCA DX test and if maybe it is paid for if the patient is under 45 and in early stage 0 to 1, I believe there was some criteria that made DRs say you are a candidate for ONCA DX testing and it is covered so we are doing it... I also am not sure if the test can be done at a later date or only when you have your surgery...    Glennie, you can ask your DR about it though - that would make sense to ask them...  can't hurt to ask, right! your BC info is not PUBLIC so I don't know what stage, grade, ER/PR+ or HER2- you are etc (you may like to make your profile public in settings so when you post - others know what your DX is)...    KITE,  u are HER2+ and ER/PR- (ONCA tests I believe are done on ER/PR+ cancers and not HER2+)... most likely why you hadn't had it maybe..       Glennie, How are you feeling now? one year out!  are you or have you gone for your one year follow up?  are you getting a MRI - if you have a natural breast left - my DR suggests that at 1 yr out (shows everything)..  hope you are doing and feeling well!  :)  ",

I know it is good that she is making women realize hey yes this Breast Cancer stuff can happen to young women - so that I agree is good,,  anyways,,, she may actually feel more like the rest of us when she isn't on TV - who knows.",

I have no regrets and more peace of mind knowing the Masetcomy removed the tissue that was very dense and full of suspicious calcifications and two small tumors (IDC) just my opinion - every women I know who began with Lump & Radiation eventually required the Mastectomy - either 2 yrs after or 3 yrs after or 5 yrs after - as they each had recurrence with lumpectomy and radiation - I just wanted to not have to worry about that happening to me....  so yes it is a longer surgery and more healing but once I get my implant in (Nov 18th), I feel I will have had 6 months of pain and discomfort from MX surgery and recovery and the fills and reconstruction process - and by Jan 2015/Feb i should feel much better and on my way to a new year and all...  I highly suggest gathering your family history - Heart disease, stroke, cancer and look over your own health history as Radiation does burn and ruin the skin that makes harder for reconstruction any time afterwards...  the end result will never look as good as if you had Mastectomy and no radiation - that is justwhat I was told from two Plastic Surgeons,,,,  see what your insurance covers too - many times a Mastectomy surgery and lymph node surgery to test sentinel lymph node winds up costing insurance company less vs you having a lumpectomy surgery (and possibly 2 of those is they don't obtain clear margins first time) and 6 weeks radiation - and about 3 weeks into Radiation i have heard the last 3 weeks people get very tired but that is just what heard,,,,  you should def ask others who had it how they felt,,,  good luck",

I had excellent rferrals for Breast Surgeon near me from someone I know who out of sheer luck works at the hospital in DR relations so she knew all the DRs and who had best reputation and she knew me well so that was very helpful - you should try to identify a Breast Surgeon whom you click with - my anxious personality - i prefer calm, quiet thorough DRs who don't talk fast or rush - i lucked out and was directed to an absolutely amazing Doctor - she is also Director of the Cancer Center at the hospital here - before you decide this is the person for me - line up a few appointments and know you don't have to go with that DR unless you feel you like them a lot etc..  I opted for Mastectomy on right as I had had scare in 2007 on that side and needed biopsy (stereotactic lying with breast hanging through table - it killed!) - then in 2014, same area on right looked like a NODULE on ultrasound - I knew when I saw it on the monitor - that looks like a cancer lump - it was! anyways opted take it off - the breast had been watched for years and after 2007 i never actually worried about them finding anything - it was far from my mind so I was in shock in 2014 when got called back next day after my annual screening - totally was not planning on hearing that - so set up two biopsies 4 days later - at that point one stereotactic biospy set and one ultrasound guided biopsy (on the nodule that I already knew in mind had to be cancer) - i have gone ot same Mammo?ultrasound center for years so when the radiologist I had seen in hall came in and said he saw a Nodule - and some other cluster area on other part of my right breast - i said \"this means trouble!\" - i knew then by looking at him and listening to him that he was pretty sure i had BC,,, i had a gut feeling - and yes that was the result of biopsy from Ultrasound - my stereotactic biopsy failed to reach the tissue that she was trying to clip for analysis - it was too deep and after MX it did show that area was DCIS... i felt being young in realm of things - most women are mid 50's/60's when get it - that having it removed made most sense - as a lumpectomy didn't feel like would give me comfort for years ahead - and only work well when DR gets clear margins and sometimes Lumpectomy requires another lumpectomy or a Mastectomy anyways as the DR can't get clear margins,,, and that would emotionally be easier for me vs having to worry about follow up testing on the lumpectomy side - they may see things like scar tissues that cause concern and i had just decided my mind would be better off knowing all the tissue is taken out - that way no tissue to worry about cancer growing in again on that side,,, PLUS I have super sensitive skin and thin fair skin so I was absolutely SCARED about radiation on my skin and by having Mastectomy and ONCA test score and gene tests done - thankful - i was not in need of Chemo and by having Mastectomy - that meant no need to radiation at all - - - that was how I determined MX vs Lump + Rads,,, you will need to research the pros/cons - all depends on your size of tumor or amount of DCIS - what Stage you are, what grade they are guessing you may be - your family history and history cancer in your family,,, etc.. feel free to post any questions you have back  Dana Farber in Boston is said to be great treatment center, Sloan Kettering in NYC, Norwalk Hospital (Smilow Center) in CT, not sure where you are - or what type insurance you have - since you are under 45, the gene testing should be free for you - it is when so young - i think that was what I was told - maybe $400 co-pay but it won't be $4,000.00 as some people over 45 have to pay - you'll have to ask the Breast DR you choose and they will put you in contact with a Nurse Navigator that will meet with you and help you understand the diagnosis and next steps -  buy a three ring binder and 3 ring hole punch and create a binder with all your test results, copy of a monthly calendar and mark down all your appointments, type of sheet with the Dr name, tel number and put in list in front of binder as you will be calling them often and in case anyone else needs to call for you - it will be on one page in front of the binder! you can put in your notes, type up your questions, keep notes in a journal to refer back to conversations, questions etc,, Surgery - it isn't fun but you'll do great - and healing takes time - but don't get too scared - tons of us made it through and did very well,, :) you will need to meet with Plastic Surgeon who specialize in Breast Reconstruction and the Breast Surgeon you choose or those you have consult with should have 3-4 names to refer to you to go meet - in my experience you want a top notch Plastic Surgeon - if they have training as hand surgeons too - that means they are very precise as hand surgery takes high level of skill - google them - ask to see pictures of women they have performed work on who had breast cancer - you'll KNOW when you meet with them if feels right -  I'm almost 1 year out from my Diagnosis - which it was Early stage - I am age 43 now - it is terrifying news,,, yes it is,,, but I have to say that having this site was one of the best things for me. there are tons of kind women on here that will help answer your questions and offer support during the next few months and year or years,,, once you identify your team of DRs - you'll feel so much calmer and then plan your surgery date and get prepped for that - it's now when all is so NEW that really is one of the toughest parts  and be careful how many people and whom you tell you have Cancer too - it changes way people look at you and for your future (career or friendships) maybe best to only tell a few close people and make excuses for why you are not out and about or can't attend certain things - not everyone handles hearing you have BC well - just know that and maybe keep it under wraps - esp since you have anxiety - too many people knowing your business is not always = wise to share,,, Rest - research - really!!! it's going to be ok - - - hugs to you too Lori - how are you feeling? there are lots of ups and downs - it's emotional, physical, stressful, can be a blessing in disguise - a wake up call of sorts, an opportunity to look at things in new ways - - - but right now you feel and post your questions.  lots boards - you'll learn a lot in next few weeks!!! My prayers are on way for you both! ",

I had strange things happen - I had my regular period the week before my surgery - sort of why I decided to pick the following week for my MX, but two days after surgery (8 days after had my period) - I got it again - heavy, nurse said that can happen post surgery as the hormones all operated on in MX and all the shock to body - they get confused,, and had it for 5 days while was feeling like hell - and then it stopped and 8 days later, again I got it HEAVY for 4/5 days and then it waited 19 days to return and now it is almost 26 days and not gotten it again yet - but haven't started any Tamoxifen - just been really anxious, having bad insomnia and worry over thinking about this whole cancer situation and how can convince myself that trying Tamoxifen is a good idea...  still on the fence on that decision and my focus now is to try to sleep, take the Zoloft again, and try to handle the pain associated with reconstruction and all that goes along with all the rest... I do appreciate hearing if anyone began Tamoxifen and had some side effects that WENT AWAY after a while and how long took before SEs subsided (I hear lots women get nauseus and vomit or have stomach problems - the other way (runs), is that true??? ",
