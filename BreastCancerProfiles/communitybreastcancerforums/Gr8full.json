Also have had some mild pain in my ribs over the last 8 months that I'm a little concerned about.  I didn't realize until now about the high risk of secondary cancers for HL survivors...since the DCIS dx I have been searching the internet and am just learning about all the risk factors. Wow!!  No idea!  I vaguely remember when I was a kid that my mom had to sign release forms regarding future risks of secondary cancers but that was nearly 30 years ago and it was not on my radar at all...until now!  I haven't had any real follow-up done over the last couple of decades and actually just kind of stumbled onto this DCIS dx so I'm just realizing that I have to be more pro-active.  ",
