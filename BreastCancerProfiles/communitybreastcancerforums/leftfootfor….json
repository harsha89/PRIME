I try to get a weekly PT/massage appointment in as well.  The simple massages and stretches I do daily make a difference in how my arm feels.  Ask for a referral to a LE specialist. It is totally worth it. I am waiting for my custom glove as I will be flying in a few weeks and again in a month.  I will wear it to avoid swelling due to pressure changes.  I am thankful to have a good LE specialist on my team. Hump day tomorrow. Hope everyone has a good one. ",

We all have them. I took my first Ativan in as long as I can remember last night. I just came down with a UTI (my second in my whole life). That was it for me.  I didn't have it in me to deal with one more thing so I took the Ativan to relax. Today is better. Of course I can deal with the UTI on top of everything, but I certainly didn't want to have to. pejkug3- sorry about the nipple.

The youngest was not even 4 months at diagnosis.  I really don't want to do this again. After surgery, I will do 6 weeks of radiation (5X week for just over 5 weeks).  I will remain on the herceptin for the duration of the year, which will take me until around march of 2012.  At least come surgery, i will only have infusions once every 3 weeks. I survived AC and did shave my head.  So far taxol/herceptin is going well. I hit a real wall the past few days and the fatigue is catching up to me. I find that I am constipated  and I do get a rash after infusion that lasts about 24 hours but that is all. Much better than AC.  Now I am trying to do my research about surgery and reconstruction.  Just trying to get through this. It is good to know you are all out there. ",

I took EMED the day of and took my ativan like clockwork the day of and after.  This actually eliminated my nausea all together. I was like a different person.  I was very tired and slept for 2 days but I felt good.  I am hopeful that you and your oncologist can find a way for this to happen for you as well.

I have moved on from dd AC and will be having treatment #10 of 12 of TH this thursday.  I wish you the strength to keep going.  YOu are in the worst of it now.  Try to remember that you have already done 2 treatments and are still standing.  It is possible.

She gave me a new prescription for a heart medicine that she usually gives to people on herceptin.  We also talked about my continued reaction of a very flushed face and red rashy hand i get every week after treatment and my sore fingers.  We decided that I do indeed have an allergy to taxol and that is why all the above are happening.  She told me that she isn't worried yet and we will continue with treatment but I need to monitor my BP at home on a daily basis, take the new meds, and the most fun, put my hands on ice during the taxol infusion. I don't know how many of you have had to do this but oh my does it hurt like a bugger.  Good news is I only have 4 treatments left. If it continues to get worse we will stop the taxol treatments.  And my tumor marker numbers are down from where I started in Jan and holding steady.  They might be where they are going to end up at until after surgery. But down is down and I am good with that. Thank you for giving my ideas for a post taxol/herceptin party.  I am so happy for all of you who have finished or are near the end of this part of the journey.  I will have a little one, but since I will be seeing them every three weeks for herceptin infusions I will probably save the big one until next year when I am done with that.

All three of my medical opinions told me they recommended a mastectomy for that side. My tumor was such that there would not be enough tissue left after removal for a breast. I also had lots of little satellite tumors in the breast besides the huge primary one. I am deciding to do the bilateral procedures for a few reasons. First, my aunt had breast cancer and only had a single mastectomy. She got cancer in the other breast and had to have it removed as well. I am not BRACCA positive so this made me worry. Second, I am young and Don't want to have to go through all the medical screenings that would be necessary if I dont remove my second breast. Finally, I am choosing to do it for reconstructive reasons. That is not my primary reason but does weigh into my decision making process. I will say that my gut instinct after seeing the initial MRI was to have the bilateral procedure. Talk to your oncologist about it. Mine did encourage me to go the mastectomy route.",

I had to cave and take benadryl after treatment to help with my rash from taxol.  I lost a few days due to being a little sleepy but it was worth it for me.  Claritin didn't work as well for me. Do they give you premeds before your taxol? Maybe you could ask them to add benadryl or something to your premeds so that you are better after treatment.  The rash on my hands was way better after I started putting my hands on ice during treatment. Hope things start getting back on track for you.",

Maybe I will lose a few pounds as I won't be able to eat on Monday, wont feel like eating tuesday, and go back to not being able to eat on Wed as surgery is on Thursday.  Not really looking forward to next week.  They want to do the colonoscopy before surgery to make sure everything is ok. Makes sense, just makes for a hard few days.  sometimes I feel like for every step forward I take I go back at least one.  I am tired tonight and feeling a little sorry for myself.  Thanks for being there. ",

One almost too small to see.  I had gamma knife (or cyber knife) radiation to the spots and so far they are all gone. I had a 99% reaction to the therapy. I go tomorrow for another MRI and I hope and expect that i will still be clear of any new or old lesions and my scarring from the old ones will remain minimal.  I am on Xeloda and Tykerb for chemotherapy.  They are both pill forms so I don't have to go the hospital for infusions.  I take something like 12 pills a day but I will take it.  The SE are minimal in chemo land and managable.  I hate them but will again take them if it means living.  My last CT scan of my body was in Feb and it showed that my liver mets had decreased in size substantially.  Best results I could have really.  I finally got the approval from my insurance for a PET scan which will give me more of the information I needed. That will be in early June.  I have seen a liver specialist and they said for now they will wait and watch me as chemo seems to be doing its thing. I am doing fine. Fatigue gets me every day but I am able to live my life and chase after my 4 young children.  I live day to day and enjoy the little things a lot more now.  It sounds cliche but every moment matters in my life now.

It did however make me feel better that is was an isolated met and nothing more. Not sure if I will have a PET scan next go round, as it is my first set of scans since my liver resection surgery or not. I am guessing we will start with a CT, as that was accurate the last time.

I know what it is like to worry about tumor markers. I worried over mine the other day. Just go back a few pages. Mine are abnormally high for me, but my scan was good. So I am hopeful that your scan comes back as stable. Kaayborg- these are the most common TM tested CA 15-3 ( normal range is <31 U/ml ) but this marker is elevated the first 30-90 days of treatment so best tested after 2-3 months of treatment CA27.29 (normal range is <40 U/ml) CEA ( normal range is <2.5 ng/ml for non smoker or <5 for smoker) cancer CA 125 (normal range is 0-35 U/ml) - this is used for ovarian cancer but my previous oncologist used it for me.  TM are not an exact science. Mine have almost always been in the normal range even when diagnosed with metastatic cancer. What we watch is for an increasing trend upwards. If they continue to rise, or stay high for me then the oncologist will order my scans before the normal maintenance time. there are lots of things that can increase the TM including cancer cells dying, PMS, inflammation, etc. So high markers can be due to non cancerous things.

So plan is to get in to see the liver specialists to discuss if they can target it individually. I wil also talk with my radiation oncologist who did gamma knife for my briam mets. they might just do that. The met looks very vacuslar so they ight not not to surgically do anything with it, even to put in implants. We will wait to see what they have to say. If it takes too long to see them, my oncologist will start a weekly herceptin treatment for me as a stop gap. Most likely I will be starting taxol/herceptin/perjeta. So no more Xeloda for me. I am to remain on the Xeloda and Tykerb until we finalize a plan. I will get a port put in if/when it is decided to do the infusion chemo. So, not the best of days, but not the worst of days. Only one tumor that is amost too small to detect. I will take that as a victory. Plus I have options. so Wack a mole round 3 here I come.",

Last time they put me on xeloda and tykerb. They took me off tykerb when I got my solitary liver tumor last July after being on the combo for 2.5 years. There are other things out there besides herceptin, but those are often more cadio toxic. And when I was off all targeted therapy, I had metastatic cancer within 6 months. I know I am getting a head of myself, but its hard not too. Just worried.",

It's a question of if your mom wants to try them. I've basically been NED since 2012 on my current combination of chemo and targeted therapy. There is hope. tDM1 or kadcyla is another option. And there are new clinical trials open. If your mom is up for it there are lots of options.,  Hope this helps",

In the end, it was decided to keep me on the xeloda (to treat my other tumor type) and to change my targeted therapy back to Herceptin infusions. Good news is that I am not giong to go on prejeta at this time. We can add that if we need later. so overall a pretty good news I guess. My big worry now is that my heart holds out. Prevously I ran into problems with the Herceptin and it had to be stopped before the year. Hoping that with my heart meds, a few years recovery and being in better health that I can avoid those problems. also because I have had a day to digest and am working very hard on reframing I am looking at myself as NED again since the rest of the scans were good and they just cut the only tumor out, I am visualizing NED.

Thinking hitting the gym with the trainer 3x a week is not hurting. If only I could lose the weight. I have another Herceptin infusion on Tuesday coming up. Will see my oncologist that day. Which is good, as I heard through the grapevine that she was leaving. She confirmed so I expect we will have a lot to talk about. I have to find a new oncologist which is stressing me out. I know it will be ok, but she is the only person who has treated me so that is a little scary. Ill have one more CT scan before she leaves probably in the next few weeks. That will be an interesting one, as it is the first scan since my surgery. I am sure it will look funky as my liver is regenerating and there will be scar tissue. Just hoping of no new lumps. It would such to have to start yet another protocall with a whole new doctor. What a way to break them in right.

The liver specialist preferred the MRI to the results from the CT scan. So I don't think it is unreasonable for you to get the MRI done. I am not sure, but I think it gave him better information about the mass in my liver than the CT did. Warning, part of the MRI required me to control my breathing, which of course is hard to do when one is told. So if you get the MR, there might be a point where they tell you to hold your breath or change the pattern of breathing so that they get the images they want. I was on Tykerb but it was in combination with Xeloda for over a year. Herceptin and I don't have a great track record when it comes to my heart function. I am still on Xeloda. It is an oral chemotherapy agent. It comes with SE, but i found it easier than the taxanes of the world. It is one of those meds that you can adjust dosage to help with SE if need be. Some people however do not do well with Xeloda, but I think this can be said of almost all chemotherpay agents. Good luck. You can PM me if you like. MY liver was once full of tumors. Xeloda got rid of them. When one came back, I opted to have it resected. More on that if you want. Xeloda has kept everything at bay for the past 2 years. ",

I think I decided to keep taking the Xeloda and go without s targeted therapy for now. We will scan frequently to watch for changes. I'm a little scared which is why I will stay on Xeloda.

I thank my mom every day, who was a cancer counselor, as she was the one who told me it wasn't just in my head. So I would ask again. It does help with getting out of the rut. I am also taking Tykerb for my brain mets and I did fine on that with the Celexa as well.",

It was hard as I had a brand new baby (3 months) and 3 other kids.  I really lost about a week every three weeks while on this treatment.  Taxol is a strong drug that is used in stage 4 treatment very successfully.  Having lived with Stage 4 now for 19 months, less SE are good. Quality of life, especially when taking care of a little, is really important.  You are at the scary time of iniital diagnosis.  but as someone who is living with stage 4, it can be done.  Once the shock is over, you will settle into a rhythm.

If I don't get that fuid moving I get so tight I can't lift my arm above my head and it limits my ablity to move it. I have never been told not to do it. I have also never been told to not take tylenol or ibruprofin. I find it interesting that you have each been told the opposite thing. Why did they tell you not to them? I also have continued to drink milk while on Xeloda. Again, nothing I was told not to do by my doctors, just something I have read here in the forums. I think that even docotrs don't know what to do with stabe 4 disease and so that is why there are different opinions and directions on this forum. I might have to reevaluate. I see my onc next week so will have to ask about a few of these things. I am thankful for everyone out there on this thread who shares their inforation and experiences. It allows me to make better choices for myself. Never too late to change things for the better. Apackoftwo- to answer your Xeloda question, my tumor markers go up and down every cycle. Somtimes it is out of the normal range and then it will go back down. I wouldn't be too concerned unless there is a drastic change in your numbers or the trend continues upward. I have finally gotten to the point where I don't freak out when my markers go up unless it continues for more than two blood draws. This has only really happened twice to me. Al lthe other times , the markers have decreased to within normals limits. So I would keep track but not worry about it unless you see a drastic or continual upward swing in the numbers.",

I realized that people were getting paid for dong the same things I do while volunteering, so I applied. We shall see how it goes. It gives me a lot of flexibility which is great because with treatment I have days where I can't work. I am also busy doing PTa president things. Somehow, I am doing that again next year.

First, I suggest that you get a biopsy of the new liver tumor in order to determine if the type of cancer has changed. This is not an uncommon thing and can lead the way for your treatment plan. next, you need to know the extent of the mets. If there is only one or a few small tumors you can decide between resection, ablation or some other methods of treatment for the tumors. If the mets are more extensive, then you will more than likely be placed on a new form of treatment. Mostly remember to breath. It is really hard to hear that you now have a new met. But there are many options out there for liver mets. This board is full of long term survivors who have had many different types of treatme best wishes",

I assume it was automatic as I am due to be having either a liver resection or ablation on July 8th. I am not in a funk. It hit home that I am having yet another surgery. I feel like I just had one evern though it was in February. I am tired of all of this. I just wanted a little time to recouperate. Iguess 6 months will have to do. I know these procedures are probably less of a big deal than brain surgery and even a double mastectomy, but it feels different. I think because I am just tired. Not scared, just tired. Tired of scrambling to find child care coverage. I just got back into my workout schedule and up to my normal only to have to take time off again. I feel ike I just asked my friends around me to help me out as I recovered from my brain surgery. Now I have to do it again. I had to ask my step mom (whom I am not close to and doens't have a close relationshiop with my kids) to come up and help me out for the week of my surgery. My husband has to go out of town for buisness. My mother in law is taking care of her husband ( who is waiting to get listed on a lung transplant list). My sister in laws each took time out to care for me in Feb and can't come again so soon. I have no parents of my own and my siser isn't an option. so I am having a hard time this go round. Life just keeps going Amd the kids are out for th summer which means the days are very l ong.  thanks for the vent. tomorrow I tlak with oncologist about best route for surgery and what changes in meds if any she wants.

He approved my oncologists decision to start me back on Herceptin. I will remain on the same two heart meds at teh same dose for now. My heart is basically back to normal. My only problem is that he really felt it was the Herceptin that caused my heart damage in the first place. So I am not feeling really optimistic right now. Actually, I am quite afraid. I am not on perjeta because it adds to the cardiotoxicity. So I am very fearful that my heart won't hold out and I will lose a whole bunch of options for future treatment. I know my fear will get better once I have had a litte more distance from this appointment and I start my Herceptin treatment again. I just wish that I could see the bright side of things. But because of all I have been through, I automatically think about the worst case scenerio. It just sucks. I am good at reframing things, but this just serves as a reminder of just how much damage this disease has done to m psyche. Againk I konw it will be better soon. I will be able to remember that he said my heart does bounce back (which means that I can take a vacation form the drug and go back to it again). and he thinks we can manage it if my hear function does drop again. he stated the obvious in that treating my cancer is highest priority. I agree. So overall good nes, just hard to stand up and say hooray. Monday I will get my first Herceptin treatment since March of 2012. May it wok its magic.  thanks all",

Their questions change as they age so we are continually adapting what they know. for you you might start with simple stuff like I am taking medicine or receiving treatment to make a bad thing better. I am not making light of the situation but I think that is about as much as 2 year old understands. I explained to my 2 year old that i would lose my boobs but that it was ok I would just look different. Not sure what your treatment plans involove so not sure what you need to talk to her about. I always answered honestly but some people choose not to do that. You will find your right path. do what feels right. My cancer center had coloring books they gave the kids that basically explained all the little ones needed to know. Try asking your doctor about that. They might have something similar.

If my decision was based on presentation and approacability, I would probably choose him. But, he did say that he wasn't sure he could get a good biopsy as they place the ablation needle first. This might effect his abilty to get a good sample for biopsy. He also said he woudl do the procedure under anathesisa so that means it is not altogether different than a surgical resection. I am leaning towards resection so that I can know for sure what type of tumor we are dealing with. If my Her2 + status has changed, it would effect what type of medicine we move on to. Still thinking and will make final decision tomorrow. If I go with resection, the surgery will be July 8th. And I am holding out a slim hope that this is not cancer. My brain wasn't so maybe this is not as well. My oncologist said this was another reason to get the tissure. spicypetunia- I think it is a good thing they want to watch your spot.

It has lots of various SE but all are managable for the most part. Check out the Xeloda website for more information or PM me and we can discuss it. I acutally have enjoyed me time on Xeloda and was glad when I was allowed to stay on it. Wandering- I am sorry that you seem to not have all the information that would/could put you at ease. I think liver biopsies are good to determine if the type of BC you have is still the same. But, depending on where your lesions are located and how big they are, this might not be possible. If this is the case then delaying chemo any further would not be worth it. And I will say that the first time I had my liver biopsied, they did not get any diagnositc cells. I had to go back a week later for a second try. They were successful that time. so it is true that even if they biopsy it, they might not get the information they need. I would try to see your doc or talk with someone else as your new diagnosis is a big thing. And the first time I was diagnosed with liver mets, I had too many for the liver specialists to do anything about. disappointing. I had almost 3 years without any more liver mets before a solitary one just poped up. This time the liver specialists said they could help me. I was given the choice of ablation or surgerical resection. In ablation, they stick a needle( or a few) into the tumor and use microwaves/radiofrequencies to heat it up and blast it apart directly. Once is has been ablated there is nothing left to biopsy. They can try to do a biospy before hand but it is not guarenteed as they have to place the ablation needles first so might not be able to place a biopsy needle. And Like I said, once it has been ablated it is gone. So if you dont get a good sample, you are out of luck. Sometimes ablation is not recommended say for example the tumor is larger than 2-3 cm or is too close to blood vessels. Ablation is localized to the tumor itself so has its benefits such as recovery time and amount of tissue lost. Surgery has a longer recover and normally involves a hosptial stay. With ablations you can go home on teh same day sometimes. I went with surgerical resection to ensure I had a good biopsy. It was laproscopic so not a bad recovery ( two days in hospital, off pain meds withing 2 days, and on vacation with kiddos after 10 days). Everyone recovers differently so I might not be the norm. anyway, I hope this helps answer some of your questions. I am sorry you are going through this. It is scary and you are right to ask the questions. We are here for you",

I only had one lesion this time and I guess it was in a good place. They had to tie off some blood vessels but that went ok. I guess if they couldn't do that they would have removed the entire left lobe. So I was lucky. The first time around with liver lesions, they told me they couldn't do anything for me because my liver was so full of cancer. So i am happy I could do someting this time around. I wish we could have moved there as well. Love Australia. We spent a month there. took the kids out of school and enjoyed every minute of it.",

I had an echocardiogram today and saw the cardiologist who follows me. To summarize, my ejection fraction is down to 40% from 55. This resembles what happened to me last time I was on Herceptin. They will do another echo in 3 months to see if this was a blip or is a trend. If it is a trend, then I will have to take a break from Herceptin. I worry because a lot of the other targeted therapies are more cardio toxic than Herceptin which will limit what we can do. Of course this all could be for not, but we all know how it goes. Putting this together with my higher (but normal) tumor markers and I am a bit worried. trying to stay positive but for now feeling like hot run over by a car. Tomorrow I know will be better but today sucks. I hate this dam cancer and all the worry it causes.  Thanks for the support",

I also hope that you find a little time to rest for yourself. Y Letmywifelive- xeloda has been a wonderful drug for me. I've been on it for over 4 years now. It does have its SE. And those Se are sometimes more intense in the beginning. There is a wonderful thread all about xeloda with lots of information on it. If you have any questions you can ask me any time. I will admit I have learned to live with some SE that some might not but that's because xeloda is still working, is in pill form and convenient to take, and keeps me out of the hospital. There are many people on these boards that are on one med to treat their bone mets and xeloda for other mets. For some reason this works. Bone mets are a different beast and can respond differently than other mets. I hope that xeloda helps with the tumor load",

It is hard to be a mom and dealing with our prognosis.  And I feel for our families and supporters too.   I recently took my kids out of school for a month and traveled to Australia.  Were were there for all of march.  We pulled from retirement as all of our family had always wanted to go there and I decided we couldn't put it off. I am stable for now and doing well with my oral treatments.  This was a good time to go.  It was an awsome experience and I would recommend anyone to get away even if it is someplace you drive to.  We made precious memories and had a good month where cancer was not a part of our life.  I know going to a foreign place isn't an option for everyone, but I highly suggest you look into those programs that allow you the time away for your family. As far as journaling/ making video tapes I haven't started that yet either. I have journals for all of my kids that i have a few entries in but I just can't get myself to write in them.  I like to live today and not focus on what may/will come.  I am putting it off for a bit. Hugs to all of you and best wishes that you have a lot more time to make more memories with your kids.",

I konw that sounds funny and doesn't make sense but I fear that that is a kind of self fullfilling prophesy. I don't know if anyone else feels that way or not.  So instead, I try to spend my time enjoying the present and not worrying about the future too much.  I go through guilt cycles however when I feel like I should be journaling and video taping. I should be working on something that they can have after I am gone.  I feel like i am a bad mom if I don't.  Plus, I don't want them to forget me.  On the other hand, if I spend too much time in that place, I find I can't get out of bed. I miss enjoing what is currently going on.  I miss the little celebrations.  That is the reason I think I hesitate to journal.  I fight the depression that stage 4 diagnosis brings every day. If I write about things as if I am not here, I find I give into that depression.  So, I journal sometimes when I feel up to it.  I find that I mostly write positive stuff about what I love about who my kids are/ what they are doing; the Type of joy I get while watching them.  On another note: does anyone have fears about their spouses moving on and their children forgetting them.  I want my family to contiue to live if/when I am gone. But it pains me so much to think that my littlest one might not remember me.  That my kids won't remember who their mom was.  I am a year and a half out of my stage 4 diagnosis and I fear that my stable condition might end at any time.  Just wondering if I was the only one who is conflicted with these types of feelings.",

I am fighting fatigue but what else is new. I can definitely tell its August and I am looking forward to time off once school starts. 4 kids under 12  during teh summer gets busy and tiring even without chemo.  But at the same time, i am dreading the end of summer.  I love no particular schedule and not fighting about homework.  We try to keep the kids as free as possible but their hobbies (soccer, football, music) leave little time after school and weeknds are short.  Fridays sleepovers are usually out so only day for socialization is sat after games.   I am off today for a whale watching trip with my boys. Hoping to see the Orcas off WA/CAN coast.  then off to the oregon coast tomorrow for a last minute summer vacation at the beach and then visit with  their grandma (my step mom). Our best summer memories are probably trips to Whistler where boys went zip lining and girls climbed the moutain. We also spent one summer on Mt. Rainier just enjoyin the hikes and views. I love living in the pacific NW during the summer. So much to do and see.  We love our annual trip to Lake Crescent In the Olympic Pennisula where we hike, swim, and canoe.  The biggest boy has graduated to helping to steer the canoe.  its on to kayaking next year Best wishes everyone.",
