It is helpful to know how the lymph system works, where lymph nodes are located so you can divert the flow to other nodes. Have them teach you how to do manual lymphatic drainage yourself. Are you in pain? Are there areas of edema that you can't reach? If so, take someone with you so they can be taught how to do the MLD also. Ask them about exercises for relief and prevention. How many repetitions, how many times a day? I received charts on the lymph system with arrows pointing the direction to rub. Do you need a compression wrap or sleeve? How long to wear it? As far as surgery delays, it probably depends on severity and pain. My PS delayed one fill b/c I was in so much pain. The lymphedema was compressing my intercostal nerve. It took about 1 1/2 weeks to get the swelling and pain under control. She did the next fill even with some swelling and mild pain. Good luck.",

In regards to the path report, they checked my SNB while I was asleep on the table and called the surgeon that it was negative. So my family knew immediately after surgery. I knew after I finally woke up. In rare cases, I think my surgeon said 2% they find something when the complete path report is done. The doctor had the complete report when I went for my follow-up a week later. I probably could have called the office and got it sooner, but I didn't worry about it since they told me it was negatvie. The way I got through it is prayer. From the time I was diagnosed, I could feel God's presence with me. I am also blessed to have good family and friend support. I talked about it a lot with friends, family and co-workers. I work in an ER so that helped.My co-workers are comfortable with sick people.  I can only imagine how overwhelming it is for someone not comfortable in hospitals and all the medical language. At times I felt my head would explode with all the information. One thing that really helped was having a good friend that checked on me almost daily leading up to the surgery. I could be honest with her about my feelings and she wasn't judgmental and had a way of asking the right questions. Good luck on your journey.",

The fill process has been kind of like braces, uncomfortable for a few days but then I'm used to them. Do you have the option of a bilateral mastectomy? If so, it's something to consider. You get better cosmetic results with implant reconstruction and don't have to worry about going through the surgery again. I decided against the tram flap because of the length of time in surgery and the delayed recovery time. Although I considered it, as a tummy tuck would have been nice.

With you seeing BC patients it's much the same, the worse time of their lives. It's good that work is allowing you to ease back into it. When you are stronger, you will be able to give the breast patients a unique support and perspective, if you chose to continue in the position. My co-workers have been great, encouraging and supportive. Many of them have told me to take care of myself. The place will still be there when I'm able to come back.

I'm very clautrophobic and I had a MRI for my neck several years ago, so when I had to have this one I was more prepared. I recommend Ativan or since you have xanex that should work too. When I walked in the room, I never looked at the machine until after the exam. When I laid down I shut my eyes and never opened them until I was out. I prayed the entire time that God you are enough, I have nothing to fear. If you're not into prayer, perhaps meditation on a positive thought that speaks to you would be helpful. Do you not have other options for a breast surgeon? Mine saw me prior to MRI. She was the one who ordered it. I know it's more trouble but you could tell the imaging center I will be there today to pick up my reports to take them to my PCP. Have them ready. Even though it's more trouble and they should do their job, you may feel better b/c you are taking control. Doctor's offices can be a real pain to deal with.

I was diagnosed in April and had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders placed on June 2. I'm blessed I didn't have to take chemo or radiation, but have started on Arimidex. I was scheduled to go back to work tomorrow. I was getting anxious about it this weekend. I just didn't know how I could do a 12 hour shift in a busy ER. I get so tired just getting dressed and doing a few things around the house. I'm still in pain due to lymphedema in my back. I guess the Arimidex has a part in the fatigue as well as hot flashes & a few other unpleasant side effects. My PS told me to take 2 more weeks off and use my energy to heal instead of work. I was feeling like a wimp. It helps to know others have had difficulty jumping back in to work also.  For WNYnurse with edema in the chest, I have been going to the Lymphedema Center where they did manual lymphatic drainage several times a week. They have taught me how to do it on myself and gave me exercises. I wear a  Assest camisole from Target and it acts as a compression camisole. It has helped the pain & edema. there was so much swelling it was compressing the intercostal nerve. It was 9/10. Now it's between 3-4.  Hope you are doing better.",

If you live near a city with large medical centers, check with the hospitals and see if they have a nurse navigator for breast cancer patients. They are a valuable resource and will help you through the process. Yes, invasive cancer is more concerning than DCIS and the treatment may vary. With 2 or more cancer sites in a breast it usually takes the lumpectomy option off the table. It would be very disfiguring. I had ILC and DCIS in the right breast and choose a bilateral mast. There are pros and cons to that and something for you to decide with all the information. In retrospect, I'm glad I did as I had two 1mm lesions in the left that didn't show on mammagram or MRI. I would also make an appointment with an oncologist. Often they don't want to see you until they get the final path report after surgery. I insisted and she was able to answer a lot of questions about probable follow-up treatment. Surgeons often don't know all the specifics on the different types of breast cancer and all the treatment options. They are trained to cut. Losing a breast is a big deal b/c it has so much to do with our body image, our sexual identity and it is a body part. Who wants part of your body cut off?
