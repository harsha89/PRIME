My surgeon explained that in the milk ducts, there are abnormal cells growing(some are round, some are oval, some big, some small, etc.). He showed me a diagram of a milk duct (picture an artery that is blocked) that is blocked with these abnormal cells. He said that at the least it puts you in a higher risk bracket for furture cancer. However, this does NOT mean that you will get breast cancer.......only that you will need to be watched more closely than the average person. I guess you just need to know if this is in your milk ducts or in the tissue of the breast. i would talk with my surgeon and go with a list of questions written down that you need answers to. Also, do a search on the internet with that and see what you find. My best wishes to you! Dee",

I too had calcifications that were clustered and rated a 4 on the bi-rad scale. i have to wait till Tuesday to find out the results. I am so nervous. I was told by the radiologist very boldly that I had cancer. I have been praying that he was dead wrong. My surgeon told me that without biopsy results, it is difficult to know for sure. The area of concern is near my left arm and very close to the chest wall. I would like to know what is next if this does come back cancerous. I do not want to delay but yet I want to make good informed decisions. Any advice? Dee",

I had a stereotactic biopsy last week and they found sclerosing papillary lesion with atypia and scattered foci of columnar cell atypia. Translated is that i need to have surgery to remove a golf ball sized amount of tissue to be analyzed to make sure there are no pre cancerous cells. This has been such a roller-coaster ride of emotions. I love this forum. I can vent here and it feels good to at least get my feelings on a screen. (smile) Please let us know how you made out.  I will be praying for you! Dee",

He also explained that it was not uncommn for the incision site to reopen in the body's attempt to rid itself of the old blood. ewwww. lol Anyway, I hope you are well!

My doctor told me not to be alarmed if the incision opened up in the body's attempt to expel the blood. Here is my problem. I started with black blood draining from my nipple the other day. I finally called the doctor and they were very concerned and will see me tomorrow. Any idea what this may be? Dee",
