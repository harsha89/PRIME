It's amazing though how before mammo and ultrasound, I never felt a thing..other than the scar stinging once in a while. No pains at all. Hmmm. Is it not unusual that both a mammo and and ultrasound would warrant the spot compression? Thanks again for responding. Ver much appreciated! Hillary",

Can cysts disappear? She felt no need to do the spot on the left based on the ultrasound, but I felt more comfortable if she did.  The tech read the report and it didn't state where in the left breast to do the spot...(great report right?)... To make a long story short, the tech did a new mammo on the left.  She made a comment..\"Oh, I'm glad I did this angle\"  and showed me something, but when the Dr. read the report she said everything was perfect and healthy.  I was so relieved I didn't ask what the tech saw.  Of course I thought about it the next day and the Dr. is out.  I thought maybe she read the wrong report (paranoid much?) lol...The office did reassure me that that doesn't happen, and if the tech saw something, she would alert the Dr. and the Dr. was not concerned.  Does that make sense? (Thank you for your patience) :) Hillary",

      "Content": "Hillary0902 wrote: Hi everyone, This is a first for me and I'm extremely worried and anxiety ridden :(. I went for annual mammo and ultrasound ( both due to being told I have dense breasts). Always have been normal. Now I was told I needed to go for additional views based on mammogram. When I explained to my dr. I also had an ultrasound she had to find results. Once she did, the receptionist (great) said dr. Said to get spot compression (vs. Add'l views??) I go on Tuesday, but I think I may lose my mind before that. I received the news at work and promptly left. Oddly enough I had no pains whatsoever but after the mammo (next day) I had THE WORST burning odd pains. I do have a scar from a dermatological cyst (benign) that was removed from left breast that I didn't have at mammo, and it has always been sensitive. I hoping that's why the sudden pain out of nowhere. Any thoughts appreciated.. Signed, Crazy with worry in Miami Log in to post a reply",
