Finally I searched on line and it is a problem from the steroids at times. Solved it myself for the cause any ways. Maybe the chemo aggravated your tummy or intestinal track and that may be some of the swelling. My diverticuliotuos acts up at times and does that. GOD BLESS and keep us posted.

She always had time for others. We can be a light to someone else. Volunteer or do something even in a small way for others. I started making prayer shawls and also prayer dishcloths.

Now I do have some in other areas but my legs will be my biggest pains. It starts two days after chemo till 4 or 5 days after. It kinda feels like someone grabs a nerve in leg and pinches it off and on. I dont sleep hardly those few days. I  need to ask dr next week about it. Nothing I take helps the pain when it does this. God bless keep us posted. Susan",

It usually only last a day. Sometimes a lil leakage. I have told the dr. a number of times and she says your drugs should not cause it. I have been on gemazar and avastin for almost eleven months. Have not had the problem with other chemos. I found out that decadron can cause it. So who really knows for sure. It is worse for me when I get both drugs. On the week I only get gemzar not so bad. GOD bless.",
