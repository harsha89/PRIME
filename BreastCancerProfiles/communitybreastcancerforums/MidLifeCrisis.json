    "Content": "MidLifeCrisis wrote: This may seem very strange, but I'm curious to know if anyone else has experienced this. I seem to sweat profusely from my \"breasts\" (I had skin/nipple sparing BMX in Sep). It only happens when I'm out in the hot sun, thankfully, and not something that I otherwise notice. I've never been one to sweat much and this was never the case pre-surgery so it caught me by surprise. I've got to assume it has something to do with the nerve damage from surgery. I won't see my surgeon again for another month so I figured I'd check here to see if I'm not alone in this very odd effect.
