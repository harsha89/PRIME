Amazingly it is now 18months since diagnosis, 12 months since chemo & herceptin , 6 months since Rads and we are doing ok. She still gets tired when she overdoes it, has pains here and there (mainly hip which seems to be a side effect from all the treatment). Its amazing really thinking about it. It is very hard to remember the really awfull time she had during the chemo and yet it is not that long ago. We certainly look at life differently since just in case the days become numbered. But at the moment we have an all clear. In 2 weeks we have the port removed - another milestone in this saga! At the moment this is probably the only constant daily reminder about where we have been.
