At the request of my OB/GYN, I got the genetic testing done and was surprised to find out that I tested positive for the Chek2 mutation. My mom was dx with stage 3 breast cancer when she was 40. There are no other known relatives with a cancer dx so I was pretty floored that I tested positive as we thought my mom's cancer was just a random occurrence. She and my sister are currently waiting for their results. With this info, my MD informed me that I should consider Tamoxifen or a prophylactic double mastectomy. I won't go on Tamoxifen (due to personal reasons) and that my mom became quite depressed and even suicidal while on the drug post chemo. However, a mastectomy feels pretty overwhelming at this point also. I'm scheduled for an MRI on Monday (still nursing my 4th kiddo so a mammogram needs to be postponed until I'm done) and my MD referred me to a breast surgeon who's familiar with check2 to consult about options. Obviously, I won't be making any decisions tomorrow but wondering if anyone else out there who has not had a cancer dx consider a preventative mastectomy with this gene mutation? Hubby feels this should be a matter of when I do it, not if so would like to see if anyone has any feedback/thoughts on this? Thanks so much!",
