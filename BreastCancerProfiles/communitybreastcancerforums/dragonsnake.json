We are asked to make decisions that we are not qualified to make, and we are not given all info that we need to in order to do it. If I would have had a localized tumor, I would probably look into proton radiation if it was offered to me. Radiation is for local control only, thus it does not make sense to me to irradiate more than the tumor bed and some tissues around it. I wrote my post on rads upon someone's request to look at rads from my professional standpoint. The gist is that  with photon radiation you cannot avoid scattering and thus the exposure of body parts other than the breast itself and auxillary lymph nodes. The radiation dose received  by the  heart, lungs, parts of the digestive tract, thyroid,  and neck may be quite significant. This can  lead to side effects other than radiation burns and fatigue.",

If you have a localized tumor in the breast, they usually surgically remove it, then irradiate the whole breast with x-rays. Are you in a trial when they shrink the tumor, and then irradiate the site? Did they surgically remove the tumor before offering photon vs. proton beam irradiation? Are you close to Berkeley, Livermore, Jet labs on East coast, Chicago, or  Michigan, where there are nuclear research facilities with big accelerators?  If you think it's appropriate, please share more info on your case, because the choice that you face is not trivial.",

You cannot voluntarily lower your dose or alter a protocol in any other sense. There are some different protocols for photon irradiation, and you may want to discuss them with your RO, but my feeling is that they do what they  know, and that's it. Regarding protons vs. photons, you need special equipment for  the proton therapy. I think, you have to have a proton source, and an accelerator to achieve a certain energy  for the proton beam.  I think that some select facilities   may have small accelerators, but some have to be in the vicinity of big nuclear labs that have particle accelerators. A choice between proton and photon therapy is not given to patients routinely. It was offered as a part  of a clinical trial to Kali44. There may be some other ladies that have this option, though. It would be great to hear from them.",

Usage of proton radiation is rare, it requires special equipment (as far as I know, access to accelerators). Proton beam can be easily focused, so it is used for treatment of localized cancers. Protons also are effectively absorbed by tissues, and thus energy is deposited locally, but the tissue damage is much greater than that one caused by high-energy photons. Please verify with your radiologist if that's the options offered to you, because usually they radiate a big area of the breast, and they usually use high-energy x-rays (photons) for that. There may be some clinical trials  in which they use a proton beam to target a tumor itself.  ",

There are number of units to characterize different aspects of the radiation sources and the beams, but even more confusing is how to determine the absorbed dose. Methods depend on the nature of the particles used for radiation, and the reaction of the tissues to this particular type of radiation. I would love to talk to radiation physicists who develop software for calculation of the received doses for radiation oncologists, but I do not know such people, and for me it would be irresponsible to post more detailed information  than I already posted  in \"my take on rads\" thread. I pulled the numbers from some publications, NIST, and Wikipedia to do these crude calculations. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_therapy",

I did not take opioids, only extra strength Tylenol afterwards. I had my drains removed on the 7th day. I have a reasonable range of motion, within 90 deg, but cannot dress myself independently. My left hand hurts and feels weak, my shoulder is sore,  but no apparent swelling. My chest swells by the end of the day, though. I do a modified bikram yoga for the muscles in my back and legs, without moving my arms beyond 90 deg.  I also went for a walk several times. .  I still do not have my pathology report because they are waiting for my previous pathology slides to be returned from UCSF where I had my second opinion.

There are two additional very small nodules that may or may not be cancerous 1 cm from the cavity - they do not show characteristic signatures for cancer, but malignancy cannot be ruled out. The other breast shows some cysts. I talked to the radiologist, and she said that nothing can be ruled out due to the fact that my DCIS does not show up on mammo or MRI. MO suggested UMX because they already removed almost 1/2 of the breast, but was against BMX because of no medical necessity. The radiologist who did the MRI understands my desire for BMX. Sassa, I'm very grateful for you sincere and honest message, I understand how difficult for you is to loose some of the cognitive abilities. I had an episode three years ago when I temporarily lost my abilities to solve complex problems: I was able to  solve low-division math and physics problems, but could not do problems for my upper-division classes. I need to be able to solve differential equations, take integrals, understand advanced  topics, do original research, etc. A loss of these abilities means a loss of employment for me.

I cannot do hormonal treatment due to a big uterine fibroid + many small ones,  although I might consider a total hysterectomy.

The place to look for it might be Russia, but I doubt that there are registries there that keep tracking of bc patients.
