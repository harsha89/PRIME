From my last meeting with Doc, and on questioning him, prodding him with many many questions, he changed the med course from ATC to the following - TC Therapy - which would include Paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide ( he dropped AC , and I am so glad after reading so much about Adriamycin ) . Chemo Port insertion on 17th under general anesthesia - what should I expect in this procedure? Anything to worry about ? First Chemo dose of Paclitaxel + Cyclo on 17th itself. Schedule for Paclitaxel is 3 times a week. And for Cyclo it's once every 3 weeks. How does the above look now ? Even though I have 10+ days left, I am very anxious/scared about chemo port insertion. I was infact willing to go IV - but doctor insisted that arm veins are too thin and fragile to take a load of chemo. Even If I went ahead with one cycle, eventually would have to go for it in the next..but it gives me the creep thinking about the same procedure - admission early morning, fasting, general anaesthesia, OT and what not.",

I can see multiple links which gives us the advantages of using circumin along with chemo. But to be double sure, have sent a message to doc as well. Same goes for protein bars(soy concentrate) vis a vis protein powder. Few of interesting reads > http://integrativeoncology-essentials.com/2013/03/... ((The above shows many advantages of using Cicumin, but on the other hand says \"it may decrease effectiveness of cyclophosphamide )) https://integrativeoncology-essentials.com/2016/04... http://depts.washington.edu/integonc/clinicians/ac... https://www.livescience.com/35077-indian-spice-cur... And finally, see this >> https://www.turmericforhealth.com/turmeric-benefit...  I am waiting for my doc to respond to above, but it looks that I will skip Circumin for next three months, till my chemo is running, and will start taking afterwords.  @Matryoshka - ahhhh, your bruise looks painful and bad. Go for port - with just one arm available, it would be next to impossible to accommodate 12 shots. Also, I think, my doses would be similar to yours - once per week, every Monday. ANd on the fourth dose of Taxol, would add Cytoxan. Sorry for the confusion earlier - it probably is not 3 times a week, but every week for 3 sessions. But still, have sent a message to doc to send me a complete schedule. @Sydsym - welcome to the same boat ! I have the same treatment plan as yours. Paclitaxel + Cytoxan.  All the positive vibes to everyone of you. We will have to fight, and hopefully would make out of it. I know next few months would be depressing, tiring and sometimes unmanageable, but hang on there ...they will pass. Out of topic, and not related to my case, a friend was being provided ATC Chemo(AC + Docetaxel) dose (which she has completed), and is on second week of Radio. Yesterday she was diagnosed with high insulin - heavily diabetic. WIth all the bloodwork done during chemo sessions, she was not at all diabetic. Can these meds cause it ?  ",

As per him, standard practice says ACT , but since mine is slow growing ( ki67 was 11%), and just one node positive, even CT would do. So instead of taking a decission he has put the ball in my court. Also, percentage wise, taking Adriamycin increases the chances in our favor by 3% ...is it worth this small fraction ?",

Keeping that in mind, 17th would be the D Day - Port Insertion + Taxol @Matryoshka - icing of limbs, and painful ? You are getting the chemo via arms/canula ? Why not port ? Also, my plan is similar to yours - 3 times a week - Taxol ( 1 dose divided in these three days, total of 12 sessions - I am doubtful on this, can you confirm the dose ? ) 4 doses of Cytoxan ( every 3 weeks ) 5 weeks of Radio daily for a total of 51Rads of rays. 5 years of harmone therapy. My retirement days had just started 5 months back - and I was really enjoying the free time, but destiny has something in store for all of us - with this diagnosis, my life, my family's life is now revolving on this. FYI, if it helps you all, I am also using the following since a month now - 1. Protein Bars - 20gm of protein in one bar - 1 bar per day. 2. Trying high protein - chicken soup + eggs 3. Circumin - Turmeric concentrate tablets - 1 / day 4. Salmon Omega 3 tablets - 1 / day 5. Drinking carrot + beetroot + pomegranate + lemon juice daily. I am hopefull to continue the above atleast till treatment. Wishing you all the best for treatment, for motherhood and for all the good things which are waiting to happen. No harm in being optimistic, right ?!",
