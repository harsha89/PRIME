I havent been diagnosed withbc but have been on the six month check for 8 years. I haven't been good about the checks for the last 12months, the last time i went to doctors was with what i thought was a pulled muscle under my arm and long dent down breast. Had u/s i have enlarged lymph node underarm but dont worry that could be caused by anything dent is probably a collapsed vein. Was not happy with that so went to surgeon to get his thoughts on it. Well waste of time that was. Decided i will get health insurance waiting period is 12 months, that times up on may1. Fast forward to now still have uncomfortable feeling like a ball under my arm, shoulder and shoulder blade pain and feel a lump in side of breast. I do have lots of simple cysts and fibrous tissues but this lump does feel different. Have a mammo booked for next week so will see what that says before i make drs appointment. I have spent time researching breast specialists in my area and know which one i am going to insist on seeing. Its now time for answers no more wait and see.  mel Log in to post a reply",

I had a mammo and u/s that showed one enlarged node under my arm. That pain now is underarm, side of breast, shoulder, shoulderblade  and along collarbone. I have cysts, dense breasts and fibrous tissues. I had a screening mammo just before Easter but no results yet. I have read with dense breasts mammos can miss things. All u/s I have had they will only check exactly where the dr has asked and not where I want. So I thought before I go asking for a referral for a ct I would ask for opinions to see if maybe a ct would be a better option than another u/s. Thanks in advance for your input.

Hope you get plently of rest and recover quickly from your surgery ",
