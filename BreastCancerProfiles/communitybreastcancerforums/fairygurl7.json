I was wondering if it was safe to take Vicodin before my surgery? All the paperwork I read said not to take Tylenol and herbals. Please tell me if it would be ok to take it. I don't want to put my surgery at risk but I'm in horrible pain. Thanks!Â  Dx 8/18/2008, DCIS, 1cm, Stage 0, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
