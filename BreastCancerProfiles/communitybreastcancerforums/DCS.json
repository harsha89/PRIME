    "Content": "DCS wrote: I had a lumpectomy in March and it included a sentinel lymph node biopsy (all negative). That was followed by radiation treatment which I finished at the end of June. Since then, I find that I have significant underarm perspiration only on the side of the lumpectomy! Â And I have never been one to perspire significantly. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Is it the result of the lymph node biopsy? the radiation? And does it end???? Log in to post a reply",
