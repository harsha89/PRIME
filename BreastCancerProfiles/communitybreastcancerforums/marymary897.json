      "Content": "marymary897 wrote: Hi everyone, Well, 7 months of chemotherapy are behind me now and 2 months ago I had my double mastectomy. Now, with radiation beginning next week, I think I might have an infection under my left arm and coming around to the front of my arm. It's sore, a little puffy, tender and it looks pink. I thought it was lymphodema beginning so I did my massaging techniques for that. The swelling calmed down then but it hasn't gone away. The pain is less today but still there and still pink. What does this sound like to you? Mary Log in to post a reply",
