They did and found a complex cyst 7cm and found calcium deposits on my right breast. They said see you in six months. I have a family history - Aunt that had breast cancer at 41. They wanted to see previous year's results and I went and picked them up and gave to them. I waited around for the results to find that it will take a few days for the radiologist to read and to wait and they will call me. When Dr. called me he said he said they said come back in 6 months and then said waiting for previous report and will issue an adendum. I was like what?? So I waited for that! It said compared the previous year and there was no change and to come back in a year. I was like! WHAT! They never said anything last year??? How could they not say anything? I asked that the reports be sent to me and she said it would take about 4 days to get to me. Any suggestions?? Like have a surgeon look at the results?? Overwhelmed on what to do. I guess my gut would say get all results from the past 10 years and look over the results and get a second opinion????",
