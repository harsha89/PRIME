My sister who was just diagnosed 4 months ago probably wishes she had the PM, because even with aggressive follow-ups by a geneticist and an oncologist, she still had to have a double mastectomy and chemo. She was the vegetarian super healthy one, I think it's why she got this at 69, and I was 49. Thank God I had a double mastectomy. But now they want me to have my ovaries out, too. I should probably do this, but we have no ovarian cancer in our family. Do you know if the women in your family that got ovarian cancer were positive for the bard-1? Also, I am very sorry for all you have been through.....I know it's a hard decision, but if it were me I would be proactive.",
