I Had a single mastectomy with a TE. No rad or chemo necessary. The pain is not sever it is just a dull uncomfortable ache. I fell like there is a curved bar from the top of my armpit  around to the bottom that is always uncomfortable and cutting in to me. My arm is most comfortable with my hand on my waist. I felt better on the perks but I hate the way they make me feel and just came off a weekend of hot and cold flashes  and a bunch of other  symptoms which I swear was withdrawal and the constipation is not bearable though I live on a variety of softener s and laxatives. I am fatigued and emotional weak. I had a small fill the other day and felt my chest compressed with a small amount of trouble  breathing. I swear the liquid went underneath my armpit. Normal?
