From the same source: 2014 death rates for black males twice that of white males, and 2014 death rate for black women, 30% higher than for white women. SOURCE The latest research I've seen comparing sexes shows median overall survival from diagnosis is 5 years for males (95% CI, 4.1-5.9 years) and 10 years for females (95% CI, 7.8-12.2 years; P < .001).

It is obviously a way to reach a demographic that responds to such slogans and imagery, ie males, in the hope that the charity will raise more cash, but the terminology makes the whole bc treatment process look like a jolly little interlude to life rather that the start of perpetual worry and, very possibly, further treatment.

I've used them, since my mom had bc at a young age, and I've been treated for breast and prostate cancer. For women, ovarian cancer commonly pairs with bc in those with BRCA. Anyway, in my case, I've got a variation of the BRCA 1 gene that is of unknown significance. Lots of people get such an ambivalent result, and it just means eternal vigilance for those who don't yet have cancer. So, just get into a good screening program and get yourself on a healthy diet and get regular exercise. Good luck to your mom with her future treatment. ",

Okay, that got you in, but it's not far off the mark because I waited three months to get my diagnosis, and it would have been longer if I hadn't Googled what was becoming increasingly severe IBC. I ended up demanding a scan which my doctor agreed to, even though she had never examined my affected breast. The surgeon took one look and quickly realised I needed an oncologist to begin with, not a surgeon. So begun treatment. Since I live in a rural area, running to a doctor every time I had a question was not on, so I needed reassurance about any treatment plan that was offered and how side effects might be controlled. My medical team soon cottoned on that I was an informed patient, like with santabarbarian, and I believe that improved treatment supervision and made me confident I was getting top-level care. And I'd bring along to appointments some obscure bit of research that had accidently included a male patient and this would amuse the professionals. Because I went on to patient counselling training and eventually the Project LEAD course, I'm not only good at evaluating research articles (handy when the second cancer cropped up) but I'm regulary asked to speak on male BC. Social media, especially Twitter, has a huge lot of medical professionals tweeting on breast cancer and they mix freely with keen and informed patient advocates like myself. There's even a weekly chat group: #bcsm. I have close to 1000 followers there as @malefitness When you're a man with this disease, you really do need Google.  ",

Based on my reading the posts of very many young guys who have posted here over the past four years, and being a guy with this disease, I'd say your symptoms are not typical of breast cancer. BC typically presents on one side only, and because the little breast tissue men have is behind the nipple, that's where the lump(s) would be. Anyway, keep us posted with the results of your medical appointment. And do keep on with your study meanwhile.  ",

First of all, you are very young and breast cancer is very rare in men (one percent of all new cases), but guys your age are extremely unlikely to get this disease. However, given your family history, if you are proven to have one of the BRCA gene mutations, this would increase your odds increase to about 10 per cent. As to your your inflammation, I've heard lots of stories here about Inflamatory Breast Cancer (and I've had it), and none have matched the pattern and widespread nature of the symptoms you're describing. Normally, just one side would be affected, likely the on that side nipple would invert, and the area would become warm. The skin would be thickened and an orange color. Have you put your family history of bc to your doctor. If there is any suspicion, a simple ultrasound of the area would likely reveal any cancer. Let us know how you go with your further investigations.",

First, do you have a family history of this disease? If so, you should tell your doctor this. Second, if you are overweight, gynecomastia can show up as lumps. This would be a non-cancerous lump. I agree your doc is taking this pretty casually and you could insist on a sooner appt. One month is a lot of worry time. The only way to know for sure is to have a mammogram or an ultrasound followed by a biopsy if the images look suspicious. Keep us posted as things progress. ",

And since he's had a lump for about 10 years it might be assumed that it is slow growing, so hormonal treatment may well be effective. You are suggesting he is ER+ PR+ but what is the Her2 result. Most men are negative for this, so Tamoxifen would be a likely estrogen blocker. Most men tolerate this very well and it often works well. for sure his team will be watching the bone spots, but the liver cysts could be benign of could be tumors. Diagnosed as Stage IV means a mastectomy is not so important, but further treatment will depend on the outcomes of initial treatment. Keep coming here with news and for advice if you wish.
