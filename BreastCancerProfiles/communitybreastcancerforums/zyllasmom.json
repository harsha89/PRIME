Should I be concerned and call the surgeon or is this the normal stage of healing? Thanks, Julie Log in to post a reply",

I go in Wednesday morning for my wire localization & open incision biopsy. What can I expect afterwards as far as pain, showering, lifting etc? Will I need to wear a bra non-stop for a while due to the stitches? I'm sure I'll learn all this after the surgery but I one of those that likes to know going into something ) Thanks.

      "Content": "zyllasmom wrote: I was supposed to a sterotatic biopsy Monday morning for calcifications, the surgeon just called and said they cancelled it because the radiologist reviewed the films and says it's too close to the skin surface. This is the second radiologist that looked at the film from 2 different hospitals, the 1st recommended incision biopsy due to my Mom's BC history and my apprenhension. This 2nd radiologist said the area didn't look too suspicious and he thinks I should just have another mammogram in 6 months. My surgeon is leaving it up to me, she said she could just do a local and have it removed in 45 minutes and be on my way. I'm leaning towards this so I don't worry for 6 months and if it doesn turn out to be something I'd rather take care of it now. What's everyones thoughts? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
