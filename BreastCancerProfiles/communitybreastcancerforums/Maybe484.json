With all of my paint markings I officially look like some sort of weird bc tribal priestess.  I have taken photos (perversely I somehow want to \"document\" this \"journey\") of my tribal markings as they become more and more extensive.  Yesterday, as two of the techs were \"painting me\" and I was looking at all of the machinery, I started thinking about being on the set of a bad sci fi flick.  Would've appreciated the advance notice from my RO or someone that after every 5th treatment I'd have to lie \"in position\" for 45 min. to an hour as I did at rad #1.  I'd read about periodic x-raying for re-positioning on the June thread and had asked one of my nurses, but he didn't indicate that the time required would be as extensive as it was the first time or when I'd have it. I wish I'd taken an anti-inflammatory and also an anti-anxiety med.  With two axilla surgeries, it's even more difficult now for me to keep my arm above my head and \"in position\" for extended time.

I've never subscribed to the belief that one has to have positive thoughts about or \"befriend\" a treatment for the treatment to work.  My attitude towards rads has been as pragmatic as possible--I see it as a necessary part of my treatment.  I do believe the stats and so I'm trying now to cope with the aftermath of SEs.  It's part of what I have to do to go on.  ETA: I did also pray (for myself and all of you!), take anti-anxiety meds, and practice visualization (some of it pretty eclectic, such as imagining I was in a sci-fi flick) during the process.  I silently recited poetry and song lyrics.  I did it all.

I was originally scheduled for 17 hypofractionated WBRs and 5 boosts--but on Tues. I discussed with my RO (who's great) the boosts and my concerns (mainly worry about LE and arm function since my dominant arm is already swelling and my axilla is looking swollen and has endured two surgeries as well) and she said she'd be willing to cancel the boosts.  We have an appointment to discuss this on Tues.--to boost or not to boost--plus my concerns about the SEs of AIs, specifically Femara. So today was my final WBR and I'm definitely red--mostly at the top of my rad field on my chest and especially under my arm.  My nipple stayed very sore and tingly from the beginning but hasn't gotten discernably worst. ETA: No one's told me I look like crap, but I know I do.  I have huge raccooon circles under my eyes--I scared myself today in the mirror. Best of luck to you all--and TGIF!",

I  think it was inevitable that I have some sort of  serious skin reaction, due to the awkward axillary location of my tumor.  Two surgeries, rads, July humidity, and an armpit are not in good company. I had a long talk with my wonderful RO today and we have decided that my boosts are officially cancelled.  When I asked her if she thought I'd had adequate radiation to my axilla, she said, \"Have you seen your armpit lately ?!?\"  So I am well done with and well done from rads.  ETA:  Also I begged and was granted a two-week reprieve till I begin an AI for five years, if I can tolerate it.  At least now I hopefully won't have overlapping rads and AI SEs.

My gynecologist has just recommended that I have a D&C, and she told me to contact the surgeon for his recommendation; she said that since I'll be in the operating room, he may want to go ahead with the excisional biopsy.  Today I had a breast ultrasound, followed by a consultation with the surgeon, who recommends that I have the excisional at the same time.  Since the lump isn't palpable, does that automatically mean I'll need a needle localization?  Are these always performed by way of mammogram, or is ultrasound an option?  (Mammograms usually send me over the edge in and of themselves, as I have lots of painful cysts.)   The surgeon didn't mention how he would locate the lump, and I didn't think to ask.  I'll call his office tomorrow.  Also, I'd like to hear from anyone who's had more than one procedure performed at once.  Is it efficient or stupid to undergo a hystereoscopy/D&C and an excisional biopsy at the same time?

Finished last WBR today--fairly unceremonius ending for me, in terms of celebration.  But glad that's done, for sure.

Seriously, I knew that because I have sensitive skin and because my tumor was in my axilla, I'd probably have some strong reaction, so I was meticulous in my skin care but then was thinking I'd be one of the lucky ones to go through rads comparatively physically unscathed.  I did fine until some slight discharge the day before my last rad.  The day after my last rad until now (Day 11 post-rads) has been unbearable.  My armpit looks like those in the pictures when you google \"severe radiation burn\" or \"wet desquamation\"--my entire armpit is one solid 3rd level burn that encompasses my incision.  I can't wear clothes, I can't do anything but survive.  So, mammalou, where do you get the Vigalon dressings?  Do you have to have a script?  As luck would have it, my RO is out of town this week.

Suebak, I hope it's not as serious as you think.  Because the doctors thought my axilla tumor was possibly not my primary, I had an MRI, CT scan, and bone scan prior to my re-excision and SNB.  I don't know if that's my doctors' standard protocol, as I'm an outlier, what with my breast cancer in my armpit. Had rad #15 and my RO appointment today.  I am scheduled to have 2 more WBRs and 5 boosts (am on the Canadian protocol).  I discussed with my RO my ambivalence about the boosts to my axilla, as I'm scared of developing LE and I already have had edema post-surgery and late last week and this week post-rads.  She said that cancer treatment is as much an art as it is a science and that she'd be ok with cancelling the boosts, as this is my dominant arm and my axilla has already been radiated (and, I might add, is now looking kind of angry and red).  Now I'm ambivalent about NOT doing the boosts.  What a dilemma.  Any thoughts? With these life-altering decisions, you don't know whether you're doing the right thing until it's too late, of course. Also, she wants me to begin Femara this week--I'd like to recover a bit from the rads, I think.",

      "Content": "Jun 5, 2011 01:32PM - edited Jun 5, 2011 01:37PM by Maybe484 Hi, all, I guess it's time for a belated formal introduction.  I joined this discussion board back in 2009 when I had a biopsy that was B9.  I think that I just somehow knew that someday I'd not be so lucky.  I've had a few scares that were B9 over the years, but back in Dec., while shaving my underarms, I discovered what I was hoping not to discover ever--a hard, pea-sized mass in my right axilla.   My immediate thought was that it was an inflamed lymph node, probably signalling another tumor elsewhere.  After a clear mammogram and ultrasound, and a radiologist's report that said it appeared to be a B9 inflamed lymph node, I saw a surgeon, who thought it was a harmless sebaceous cyst and told me the proverbial \"wait and see.\"  I became concerned because it seemed to be increasing in size.  Even after surgery to excise it on 4/8/2011, he said he'd be \"shocked\" if it were cancer.  It was.  So I'm now with a team of doctors at a multidisciplinary breast clinic at a teaching university.  Because of the relatively unusual location of my tumor, and the possibility that the excised mass was a metastasis of a tumor elsewhere, I had an MRI, a CT scan, and a bone scan, all clear, and so my team has determined that the axillary tumor was my primary.  I'm still recovering from a re-excision/SNB (0/3 nodes) on 5/17//2011; the re-excision showed residual cancer but clean margins.  Because it was the second surgery in two months to my axilla, and because my tumor was in the same vicinity as my SNs,  I've probably had more pain and discomfort than I think most people must have with re-excision and SNB.   I'm now in limbo awaiting the delayed results of my Oncotype test.  I'm pretty sure I'm stage one, as the original tumor excision was .8 cm and I have clear nodes and no metastases found.  Intermediate grade, mixed tumor, and highly ER/PR+.  So I'm sure you'll be hearing from me from time to time.  I've been reading all of your posts for a long time and want to thank everyone for providing invaluable support and information.",

Again, I'd like to urge everyone to check their armpits and upper arms, when you do BSE.  When having ultrasounds, ask the tech to check in that area as well.  If you do find a lump, do not allow any doctor or tech to tell you that it's just a cyst, unless they biopsy it first.  A primary BC tumor may indeed originate in your upper underarm!",

If you'd not had shingles, you certainly don't want it.  Vivi, hope you're feeling better soon.",
