Just a little background...I was first diagnosed with Stage IIIc ILC in February 2013, and had a full course of treatment.  I was found to have bone mets after a routine set of interval blood work showed an elevated CA 15-3. My oncologist immediately switched me from tamoxifen to Femara, Faslodex, and Xgeva.  Repeat blood work done a couple of days ago show a further rise in the CA 15-3 (my CEA is normal, as are the rest of my results, except for a low platelet count).  Has anyone else had this happen?  I believe my oncologist told me that it takes some time for the meds to kick in, but of course I'm very anxious.  I have no bone pain or other symptoms.
