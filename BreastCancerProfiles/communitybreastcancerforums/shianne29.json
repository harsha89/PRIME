It's really weird to have this much pain when the breast, underarm and upper back portion of my arm are numb. I mean like I can't feel anything touching them. Is this like phantom limb pain? It seems to be slowly getting worse. My BS is on holidays this week and I'm not sure if I should wait till she gets back to have it checked out. I'm going to post a new thread as well lol. There is so much knowledge on this site!!",

The media coverage that claims awareness has been raised...FUCK awareness. Find a cure, everyone knows about BC. The fact that she states back to normal in a couple days will create depression in patients having mx/bmx because they HAD cancer and are still in bed after a couple days, hell the drains aren't even out for a week or more! Small scars?? Really, the one across my abdomen is far from small. Her kids see normal mommy? Mine don't. And I doubt any child whose mother was forced thru chemopause and baldness, rad burns and projectile vomiting sees their mommy either. Fact is, she did not raise anything for BC, she didn't have a bmx due to BC she had a boob job. She is not brave or admirable. I respect her choice as I'm sure it was difficult, however, if I was given that same choice it would be a no brainier. No lost sleep, no stress, no feelings of control lost or betrayal by my body. Yes, I'm angry too, bloody right!! Not at her, at this disease but also for the media that glorifies the fact that the only option to prevent it is amputation. If AJ wants to help in this cause, make THAT statement. Amputation is the only prevention, and that's not acceptable. But do NOT simplify the procedures that I was forced to have. Do NOT put into people's minds that recovery is easy and quick. It's hard enough getting support and assistance after, women are supposed to be everything; mommy, partner, teacher, cook, nurse, the time we need to recover is cut short enough by demands of life, do NOT diminish that.",

I've also been using \"Bio-Oil\" since my stitches healed to help heal the scar. I'm worried about the recon holding up well. My BS and PS were adamant not to do immediate recon until my post chemo MRI came back NED. BS said no rads would be needed and went ahead with diep. Well, my path report came back with. 7x7.5 cm tumour with focal margins :-( so now I need 25 rads. I start on February 26 which will only be 6 weeks post op. my breast tissue hasn't completely settled yet and I'm afraid the rads won't help that any, that my breast will remain as firm and high as it is. Anyone have any experience with this?",

I had to start Effexor 37.5 mg for all the side effects (chemopause) and I'm actually doing ok now. My moods are more stable and hot flashes went from about 25-30 a day to maybe 5. I sure hope Tamoxifen doesn't increase those again!!!",

My MRI showed cCR but my path report showed a 7 cm tumour. It was just over 6 before chemo!!! How in the name could this tumour not been seen on the MRI??? How could it have grown when every 2 weeks physical measurements showed shrinkage?? How can this be??? MO says that I need rads again. I've had recon already and it looks FABULOUS only 2 weeks out. I don't want to chance that rads will ruin it. Seriously, I was so on top of the world for the past 3 weeks thinking I kicked this beast in the butt and now I feel like my world has crashed on top of me. I know rads aren't bad considering everything I've already been through, but I was in the healing and moving forward mode and now that is all put on hold again!!!! ARRRGHHHH!!!!!!! I don't know if I've got enough left to get through this. :-( I just want to go and hit my first BS so hard. I want to ruin his life. This is the guy that 3 yrs ago told me the 8mm mass \"was fibrocystic and not to worry. We'll watch it closely\". Watch it he did!! US, biopsies, and mammos every 3-6 months. When I asked him to take it out when it got to 2.5cm he said \"no it would deform my breast and its ok. It would likely disappear after menopause.\" May he lose his arms in a horrific accident and his crotch be infested with mites!!!!",

Consult with PS squeezed into same day as BS. That was the 4th on the 8th I was called with a surgery date of the 12. This was a Saturday. They both, along with an anesthesiologist did this on their day off. In Canada, surgery is not scheduled on weekends!!! Anyway, long story short. New BS great. Old BS $hite!!! liv- no apologies!!! I'm all for innuendoes!!!!! You are right also, it too can be reconstructed. Just the shock!!! I can do this!!! I have to and I can!!!!

No neuropathy, didn't lose nails but all my fingers and toes peeled and were numb for a few days after each treatment. My head hair started to grow again on taxol also but eyebrows and lashes fell out lmao. Go figure. It was the pain that was the worst. BUT!!! It is doable. Get pain pills before and take any preventative meds they give you. And I found exercise helped. Sounds dumb but the more active I was the less pain and for shorter duration. Good luck.
