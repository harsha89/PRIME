      "Content": "Kaliaja wrote: Hi \u2013 I\u2019m new to this board and the ladies on the IDC board suggested I check with you guys.  I really need some expertise/experience.  My 74 year old mom\u2019s been diagnosed with IDC. She\u2019s in such a state of shock and denial that she\u2019s not processing.  I have been trying to come up to speed but there is so just so much out there and, though I\u2019ve spent dozens of hours researching,  I am feeling overwhelmed and horrified that I don\u2019t know enough \u2013 may never know enough \u2013 to guide my mother to the right decision.   That\u2019s why I\u2019m here.   Long story short, bizarre as this sounds, after recovering from a fall in which she broke her hip and had a severely inflamed/bruised shoulder, when the inflammation went down over the course of several weeks, in its place was a huge mass that did not go away. Although my mother swears this thing was not there before the fall, it seems impossible to me that something that big could have formed in the course of less than 2 months. The mass was diagnosed as IDC and the tumor is \u201cthe size of an apple.\u201d  T4.  Locally advanced with lymph node involvement in the right breast.  She is HER positive, ER positive, PR negative.  They are putting it at stage IIIC.   She only has one kidney and she has had bladder cancer in the past but it has been contained and treated.  However her PET/CT showed a mass of suspicious tissue in the renal pelvis which must be investigated before they will start her on treatment.   She has a ureteral stent which must be replaced so she\u2019ll have that done next week and while they\u2019re doing that they\u2019ll examine the problematic area in the bladder.   Assuming everything\u2019s okay with the bladder (or can be made so), the medical oncologist is pushing her hard for chemo to shrink the tumor.  He\u2019s proposing Herceptin given concurrently with either Taxotere and Carboplatin or Adriamycin and Cytoxan.  Second option is Herceptin with a single chemo agent.  Third is to go with Herceptin and the hormonal therapy (some combination of Arimidex, Aromasin, and/or Femara).    The idea would be shrink the tumor, do a mastectomy and then radiation, chemo and the AI\u2019s.  He\u2019s really pushing for the chemo but my mom doesn\u2019t want chemo and, while I might be able to persuade her, I\u2019ve read in a couple of places that chemo is often too harsh for older women and that the AI\u2019s work just as well.    I really feel out of my depth here \u2013 I\u2019m so scared of leading someone I love so much down the wrong path -- so I\u2019d be grateful for any advice you can offer.   Log in to post a reply",

Brenda -- I am really hoping my notes are wrong and that he only indicated Herceptin with the Taxotere and Carboplatin (not the AC regime).  Otherwise I'm going to have a real crisis of faith....Thank you for the warning.... Again, thank you to everyone for the support and encouragement and I dearly hope that you are repaid in kind somewhere along the way.... ",
