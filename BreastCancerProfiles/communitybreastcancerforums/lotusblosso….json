In class they talked about getting the HPV vaccine and ovarian cancer.  She told the other children in class that her mom had cancer and would never be cured.  The teacher told me it was quite an emotional conversation and that many of the children had tears in their eyes as she told our story... You think that they are too young to really understand, but they understand much more than we think they do and sometimes their frustration comes out in ways that we might not easily be able to control. Like you, I also thought I was too lax and spoke to the teacher about it.  She told me that being lax was probably the wisest thing I can do.  These kids have enough on their plates. That being said, I try to not let her get away with too much and always ask the school to let me know when they think something is up that we might be missing at home.",

I was also diagnosed at stage IV from the get go. That was 3.5 years ago and I am still doing very well. I am Canadian and was concerned that I might not have access to the best services. I was lucky enough to have private insurance that allowed me to get a second opinion through Best Doctors. So I was able to get a second opinion at Dana Farber, where they told me that my Canadian hospital was doing the best for me. My oncologist is American and I have told him that I will go wherever I need to for treatment. He says there is no need since Canada has access to the best treatments available. I have heard that British Columbia has world class treatments and lots of research going on, so I think you are at the right place. When I asked my oncologist about clinical trials, he told me it is something to use after standard treatment has been tried. I trust him immensely, he has an excellent reputation and is a professor/researcher at McGill University. My recommendation is that,once the shock of the diagnosis has lessened, take the time to have a talk with the oncologist so that he can explain what can be offered to your sister in law in BC and so that you can make informed decisions. I know that, from what I have seen on these boards, we seem to have easier access in Canada than many of the other countries.",

After 4 months of treatment, I was really anxious to get back to work, so I decided to go back full-time.  Then the hand and foot syndrom hit me.  I ended up having to go to work in slippers and gloves. since the skin was just falling off of my feet so badly.  It would take me forever to walk to the ladies' room or the cafeteria.  But since my mind was all there and I have a desk job, I continued to go. It was only after I was taken off this combo that employees started to tell me how difficult it was for them to see me in that state.  I realize now that working during that period did me more harm than good, and negatively affected the employees, who really felt sorry seeing me come into the office. Then, I switched to Taxol.  After I lost all my hair, the president could no longer look me in the face.  Even though I felt great and was stable, the office took the fact that I was bald as a bad sign.   Just this year, I was removed from my management position and given 'special projects'.  I was told that senior management does not believe that I will live long enough to be promotable into a new role, no matter how hard i may work .  They tell me this regardless of the fact that I have been stable for 3 years now and am finally having regression. So, in my case, it is the company pushing me out.  Senior management feels uncomfortable having me around.  I feel like I have become a persona non grata.  I made the mistake of giving time and energy to an employer who is afraid of death and afraid of cancer.  The employees support me 100%, but not management, BTW, a company who knows I have cancer has just offered me a job. So, I guess my point is: know your employer, make sure that they will support you, regardless of the decision you make. Good luck. ",

At the time of diagnosis, my mets were so extensive that the PET scan report was 3 pages long. My onc told me I looked like I had been in a radioactive accident. Mets included axilla nodes, neck nodes, hilar and mediastinal nodes, lungs, biliary tract, spleen, pericardial sac, pancreas,spine, muscles and soft tissue. I started treatment with Xeloda/Gemzar for 8 months. Initially there was some response but then eventually progression. I was switched to Caelyx(Doxil?) which failed. I then was switched to Taxol for 16 months. Again, initial response to progression. Then I was switched to Navelbine as a last resort. Navelbine kept me stable for 20 months. Then, quite suddenly, I began to show rapid response which brought me to NED. That was in February 2013. I have been without treatment since. Throughout my treatment, I never took more than a couple of weeks of chemo holiday and was diligent in all health matters. I exercised regularly and continued to work until the day my employer forced me onto disability (that's a whole other story). It has been almost 6 years since my stage 4 diagnosis. I am doing well. Here is a video that I did with the Canadian Breast Cancer Network called \"Living Legacy\". We are 3 participants in the video, 2 of us are stage 4 TN. I am the red head with the Chinese name, which in English means lotus blossom. I hope the link works..... http://www.cbcn.ca/index.php?pageaction=content.pa...  ",

I actually feel like life is 'normal' on Navelbine.  Also, my nurses tell me that when it works, it works for a long time. I met one woman wo has been stable on it for 5 years! My youngest was 5 when I got my diagnosis in 2009.  I was stunned, since I felt fine.  Since diagnosis, I have continued to be very busy: work, exercise and trying to be the best Mom possible.  My onc calls me the Eveready bunny!  He thinks that my activity is what makes the difference for me.  Since diagnosis, I have had mostly stability or regression (knock on wood).  My onc keeps on telling me to say busy and not stop. So, I think you are right when you say that your exercise and eating well has made a difference. Don't stop!!! We need to put all our chances on our side!! Good luck with the Navelbine!  I hope it kicks those mets to the curb!",
