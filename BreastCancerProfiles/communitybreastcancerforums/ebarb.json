My microcalc is 3 cm located on the upper outer quadrant at 10:00.  Now I have to go for an MRI on Tuesday (has to be during a certain time in the menstrual cycle) and they expedited my biopsy so instead of hearing Friday I may hear as early as tomorrow or Thursday.  Regardless if it is benign or malignant I have to see a surgeon and have it removed.  I am scared out of my mind.  If I didn't already think the result was going to be cancer, I certainly think it now.  3cm is large!  I read the stages and the size alone would be either stage 2 or stage 3 cancer.  Is there any way that it could be stage 1 or 0 still?  Then it might not be DCIS?  I thought if anything it would be DCIS because of the microcalcs.   Any guidance or words of encouragement?  Now I am thinking it could be worse than I orignally thought.  PS What does it mean when they say the lump is broad, other than the obvious?  IDC, 5/26/2010 Dx 5/26/2010, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 3/16 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I'm 30 years old and have been going to the gyn since I was 20 FAITHFULLY every 6 months for BE and gyn check ups.  My very first dr. in 2000 told me I was cystic.  I've told every doctor I've had since that I am cystic.  They told me not to worry about anything.  I've told them that my Aunt (mom's sister) had BC and survived over 10 years ago.  They told me not to worry. I found a lump and ran to the dr.  She almost blew me off until I said \"feel it when I sit up... it's there\" and she sent me for an ultra and a mammo.  The ultra lady said \"I see nothing\" and the mammo found suspicious clusters.  I am scared out of my mind.  I've always been cautious and went to the dr. more than I went to church.  Why is it they found something now that can't even be seen?  If I didn't feel something and insist that there was a lump she never would have sent me.  PS- I was only at the gyn 5 mos. ago and there was no lump that I could feel. What I felt and what the mammo picked up are 2 different things.  Thank god I insisted.  Do these take a long time to form?  Could this be new or something I've had for years??
