      "Content": "Sinsin wrote: So I am seriously debating having my ovaries removed before I start rads. I am currently in menopause from the chemo and am 34 so it is likely that I will not remain in menopause when done with treatment.Â  I am NOT BRCA positive but I currently have a chemical imbalance that causes me to be on a roller coaster of depression especially when I menstruate. Since being in menopause I have balanced out and my antidepressants are able to work. So that is a pro. Also, my mother went through menopause early and by 42 had a hysterectomy due to severe menopausal symptoms. So it is likely that I may undergo menopause early as well and I do not wish to suffer as bad as she did.Â  I have discussed this option with my oncologist and she is on board with it and is of the opinion that post menopausal women have possibly better success with Tamoxifen and minimizing recurrence. There is a study currently being done to see if this is true that should have it's results posted at the end of the year. However, I would prefer to not wait as when I am done with treatment, I'd like to focus on recovery and not more surgery.Â  I was wondering if any of you had undergone an Oophorectomy and what your thoughts on it were. Was it worth it? Or was it not? Thanks in advance for your input!

I have just been diagnosed with IDC and in fact, am 6 days out on recovery from my mastectomy. And from day 1, I have have never been able to align myself with the \"Save the Ta-Tas\", or the whole pink thing period (makes me require pepto bismol but then I'd really be sick by the pink redundancy) nor when my loved ones tell me \"we'll get through this\", etc. All I can think is \"you don't know that for sure, you can't make promises you're not 100% sure of.\" And I think it's because the truth is, people really don't know. Â Most people aren't familiar with breast cancer, or aware that there are different types, the stages or even all the treatments and their effects. What most people do know is what Susan G. Komen has put out there, and that's all the pink warrior stuff and the many survivors and their stories they use to obtain funding. Not that there is anything wrong with that but because of it, I think it has lead people to believe that it isn't as deadly as other cancers and that women are still dying from it. So when people say these things, we need to try and take it with a grain of salt and know that they mean well. Then, set 'em right! ðŸ˜‰ And good luck to all of you lovely ladies and f*** cancer!",
