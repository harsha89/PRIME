I was afraid mine would be like that, because I have very low pain tolerance and locals don't always work. I've had a lot of other procedures that were supposed to be nearly painless, and I always scream and cry. I was lucky, the women's center where I had mine done always uses IV sedation for biopsies. When I told them my concern, they gave me just enough to make me sleep through it. However, I was awake for the mammogram afterward, and left blood all over the machine. They had trouble getting my bleeding stopped, too. They put a binder on me afterward and gave me an ice pack to use, which made it feel much better whenever it hurt. I do hope you get good news.",
