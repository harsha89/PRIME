This site has some good educational materials regarding advanced or metastatic breast cancer as well as information regarding the various sub-types of breast cancer.  There are many, and each has different recommended treatments.  If you are up for something a little more detailed, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has guidelines for cancer treatment.  They publish 2 versions, one for patients, and one for doctors.  Go to their site (www.nccn.org) and look around to find the download page.  They don't check to see if you are a doctor, so you can download the physician guidelines for breast cancer treatment if you want to. There are MANY different treatments available to treat breast cancer; it's a bit of an art.  Reasonable doctors can differ in their treatment recommendations.  I felt better after looking at them because it helped me understand that despite progression, there are still many options for treatment. If you feel that it may make you anxious, just avoid it.   Many people prefer to find a doctor they trust and let him or her worry about the treatment plan.",

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2010 09:43PM 33skidoo wrote: I am ER+/PR- stage IV from the get-go.  Initial treatment was Tamoxifen, radiation, and surgical reconstruction of my back.  I have bone-only mets. Got to remission/NED.  Was switched to Aromasin after I became post-menopausal.  Evenually had some progression, got radiation and switched to faslodex.  Tumor markers are back down to normal range.  So I have to say that hormonals have been working for me.  My status has never been reported in percentages (and I have asked). I have tried to research the whole PR- issue and have found very little.  I did find a research article that said that lapatinib improves event-free survival for ER+PR-Her2- patients. In MBC, lapatinib improved EFS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors and also in those with tumors that were HER2 negative, ER positive, and PR weak. In MBC, lapatinib improved EFS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors and also in those with tumors that were HER2 negative, ER positive, and PR weak. Up to 25% of women with breast cancer have amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a finding that is associated with a poor prognosis. Identification of HER2 as a target for therapy has been validated by the use of trastuzumab and lapatinib. In contrast, agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have not shown significant activity in breast cancer. The role that EGFR plays in the pathogenesis of breast cancer is not clear. Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of both EGFR and HER2. Prior studies have suggested that a relationship exists between loss of progesterone receptor (PR) in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive disease and higher expression of HER2 and/or EGFR. In addition, some data suggest that patients who have triple-negative breast cancer, (tumors that lack ER, PR, and HER2 amplification) have higher EGFR levels and enhanced sensitivity to EGFR-targeted agents. The present study was a retrospective analysis of patients from EGF30001, a phase III study investigating the use of lapatinib plus paclitaxel as first-line therapy for patients with HER2-negative or HER2-status-unknown metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate ER, PR, HER2, and EGFR expression and correlate the expression with benefit from lapatinib. Of the 579 patients enrolled in EGF30001, 493 patients provided tissue available for testing. Among these, 86 patients had tumors showing HER2 amplification and 407 patients did not. Lapatinib was found to improve median event-free survival (EFS) in HER2-amplified disease and in patients with either ER- or PR-positive disease. However, the improvement was greater in the group with hormone receptor-negative disease. In the patients without HER2 amplification, lapatinib showed no benefit based solely on that biomarker. Subgroup analysis of patients with HER2-nonamplified, ER-positive breast cancer showed that median EFS improved based on expression of PR. For the group classified as PR-strong, there was no improvement of EFS. Some improvement was noted for the group classified as PR-weak, and there was possible antagonism for the PR-negative group. The subgroup of patients with triple-negative breast cancer did not show improvement of EFS with the addition of lapatinib. Overall, EGFR expression did not predict for improved median EFS with the addition of lapatinib. In the use of targeted agents, patient selection is of critical importance. This study provides additional evidence supporting the existence of a relationship between the HER family and hormone-receptor signaling.",

I was stage IV from the get go.  Went to the doctor after ignoring what I thought was garden variety back pain for some time.  It got to the point where I could no longer ignore it.  An MRI revealed metastatic bone tumors to T11 and T12.  T12 was almost completely gone as well as collapsed and the tumor was wrapped around my spinal cord.  No wonder it hurt ;^).  It took a good while to determine where the cancer had originated as my mammograms had been clear and we could not feel a tumor in my extremely dense breasts.  But the consulting surgeon thought he could feel something, and sure enough was able to locate a tumor deep in the tissue. I had major reconstructive surgery to my back which necessitated a seven level spinal fusion with pedicle screws and rods.  The surgery was a piece of cake compared to what I had been through prior to the MRI and I was walking soon with the help of physical therapy.  Staging studies showed more tumors in hip and ribs.  Went on Tamoxifen which was working well on the cancer but caused a crazy-big ovarian cyst which along with adhesions compressed my ureters and caused kidney problems.  Cured that problem with total abdominal hysterectomy and had ovaries removed while I was at it.  The gyn onc insisted on doing the large incision to reduce the chance of spilling the contents of the ovarian cyst (which was extremely hot on the PET scan and it was suspicious for mets).  Due to the adhesions, he popped it anyway and ended up doing a bowel resection to boot.  Good thing the pathology was all benign! I went back to work after that, working as a public defender of sorts.   I was able to do that for a little over 3 years before it got to be too much in light of my various physical issues and need for ongoing medical treatment.   Retirement was a bit of an adjustment but I no longer miss it.  The removal of that stress actually helped my overall condition and I feel better even though things appear to be a bit worse on paper. I'm more than 5 years out from the stage IV diagnosis and feel hopeful that I'll be around for a good while longer.  Since my diagnosis I have been able to travel to visit my family members that live out of state and went to a fabulous B&B in New Mexico with one of my sisters.  I still plan to see the aurora borealis, but have been scandalized over the expense.   This site has saved my sanity.  I love it and the people I've met here.  Thanks a lot!!!",

I have had spinal mets AND garden-variety back problems.  Believe me when I say that garden-variety back problems hurt AND you can get referred pain to the hips and pelvis from pinched nerves in your back.  IF it turns out you have cancer, it is NOT an emergency.  Take your time to get the information you need to make informed decisions.  I know, I know, my first reaction was to jump up and down waving my hands and wailing \"get it out get it out get it out RIGHT NOW.  That was then, this is now.  Take time to make decisions after panic mode fades.

Go in armed with your list of questions, don't bad mouth your current doctor, tell the new doc that you are crawling out of your hole of shock and doom and are ready to hear about your options.  ",

I did see a story once about a young woman whose mother had died when she was young and who had prepared letters and keepsakes to be given to her at big life events like graduation and marriage.  The daughter had such an ambivalent attitude towards them.  On the one hand she treasured them but on the other hand she dreaded the obligation of opening them.  So hard to know what to do.    ETA:  I find myself trying to duck out of photos because I don't like the way I look with my steroid moonface and fuzzy head.  But I think I should try harder so that someone can have those photos later. ",

Had radiation, surgery, tamoxifen and zometa.  Got to hear the R word. Tamoxifen caused huge endometrioma (ovarian cyst).  Surgery to remove it revealed extreme endometriosis.  Neutered. Now switched to Aromasin because of side effects of tamoxifen and post-menopausal status. Currently doing well. I've been wondering if the endometriosis caused the breast cancer.

Please follow through with finding the best meds for you to get your pain under control.  Pain saps the soul.  I was undergoing treatment for depression when I got my stage IV cancer diagnosis.  I knew I was in pain, but didn't quite realize the effect it was having on me until my pain came under control.  Depression gone.  Completely.  Oddly, I am so much happier despite the cancer diagnosis. A wise older nurse once told me that it is much easier to keep pain at bay than it is to get it under control once it has flared.  Others on this site have compared it to a fire... easy to put out in its early stages, but a raging forest fire takes a lot of time and effort to bring under control.  Do whatever it takes to get your pain under control, and take pain meds EARLY when it seems to flare back up.  You can thank us later. ;^)",

Pain is significantly better, but not gone.  If you are still having nerve compression you might look into a surgical fix.  I think kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty can only done when it is a fresh injury. Certainly that would be far less complicated than what I had done if it is still possible.  My surgery was done by a neurosurgeon at a cancer center.  The local doctors were reluctant to do it as they figured I would die soon.  Five years later, I'm having the last laugh.",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2010 11:09AM - edited Apr 2, 2010 11:15AM by 33skidoo Jenny, I had extensive mets in my spine, along with others in my pelvis, ribs and femur.  I was diagnosed when I ended up in the hospital with collapsed vertebrae and tumor wrapped completely around my spinal cord.  At the time, I honestly believed that I would not leave the hospital.  A sister-in-law is an oncology nurse and frankly thought the same.  The consulting neurosurgeon did not wantn to do any surgery beyond a biopsy.  But my onc was GREAT.  He told me that although stage IV breast cancer is considered to be \"incurable\", there were many effective treatments that could push back the disease, and that some people did indeed achieve remission.  He explained to me that \"palliative\" does not mean pain meds only and wait for death.  Palliative care is ANY treatment that does not have curative intent.  It includes reconstructive surgery, bone stabilization surgery, radiation to knock back the disease and/or for pain relief, systematic treatment for sympton relief, etc.  As my cancer was hormonal, my treatment plan was to have reconstructive surgery and radiation on my back, removed the primary from my breast (that's how we got the initial pathology), and hormonal treatment for the systematic disease.  After an initial scary \"flare\" when treatment first started, I achieved \"remission\" within several months.  I'm 2 1/2 years out from my initial stage IV diagnosis and living a normal life.  I do still need pain meds as the extensive bone mets have left a lasting impression, but it is quite manageable. Don't feel stupid.  I did too.  How could I be stage IV from the get go when I lived a healthy lifestyle and got my mammograms?  Remeber that any symptoms that you may have had were NONSPECIFIC.  It could have been anything.  Sure, I had back pain, but that can be very normal for a middle-aged woman with a family history of back problems.  Sure, my mammograms were normal, but I didn't know that mammograms, while better than nothing, miss a lot of stuff, especially if one has dense breasts.  I didn't have a \"lump\" that I could feel in my breast.  My primary was relatively small and BURIED deep within my dense breasts.  I did have a problem with lymph node in my armpit flaring up from time to time, but I had asked about it and was told that it was normal for them to pop up from time to time, it was probably a reaction to some infection and would go away (and did).  The vast majority of breast lumps are benign. We don't know all that much about cancer.  Who knows what caused it to appear?  Did I not wash my fruits and veggies enough?  Did I eat meat from animals that had been treated by hormones?  Did I not properly handle a pesticide I applied to the garden?  Was it just plain bad luck and I got my cancer due to a sporadic genetic mutation?  Who knows?  All we can do is get by the best we can. Please follow the advice of the other compassionate and experienced women in our forum.  They have learned their lessons the hard way and you can benefit from their wisdom.  A stage IV diagnosis is a very hard thing to get your head wrapped around, and it will take some time.  Give yourself a break.  Pick yourself up, get another opinion, interview doctors and find one you like and trust.  Get some antianxiety and/or antidepressant meds.  You will feel  much better once your treatment plan is in place. Hugs. Claire",

The shots DID help temporarilly (for several weeks each).  Having completed the series, insurance will not pay for another series for at least 6 months.  My back is somewhat improved, but I'm nowhere near pain free.  If I could guarantee success with surgery, looking back I think that I probably should have had the surgery.  However, since there is no guarantee of success and because I have already had extensive back surgery (7-level fusion), I am content with my choice. YMMV.",

Later had PET/CT which revealed highly metabolic lesion near a ginormous ovarian cyst.  Referred to an oncologic gyncologist due to possibility of mets in that area.  Had abdominal hysterectomy with the vertical incision 8^(! to make sure that the cyst be removed without popping it and spreading potentially cancerous cells throughout abdomen.  Fat chance, he popped it anyway!!!  Turned out to not be cancerous but crazy bloom of endometriosis probably due to the Tamoxifen.  Surgeon cleaned it out, got rid of numerous adhesions and I made another good recovery.  I have had progression of bone mets from time to time, more radiation and later developed \"innumerable\" lung mets.  Did a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins for vaccine.  First chemo for lung mets (Cytoxan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) didn't work, but next chemo (Abraxane) has been working.  Lung mets are fewer and smaller!  This time last year I thought I was on the downhill slide, but have been doing well after chemo change.  Thinking the vaccine may have helped. Feeling good and hope to live awhile longer.  Thanks to this site, have kept my mental health on an even keel.  Thanks for all your support and advice.  Edited for spelling, punctuation & grammar.

Later had PET/CT which revealed highly metabolic lesion near a ginormous ovarian cyst.  Referred to an oncologic gyncologist due to possibility of mets in that area.  Had abdominal hysterectomy with the vertical incision 8^(! to make sure that the cyst be removed without popping it and spreading potentially cancerous cells throughout abdomen.  Fat chance, he popped it anyway!!!  Turned out to not be cancerous but crazy bloom of endometriosis probably due to the Tamoxifen.  Surgeon cleaned it out, got rid of numerous adhesions and I made another good recovery.  I have had progression of bone mets from time to time, more radiation and later developed \"innumerable\" lung mets.  Did a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins for vaccine.  First chemo for lung mets (Cytoxan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) didn't work, but next chemo (Abraxane) has been working.  Lung mets are fewer and smaller!  This time last year I thought I was on the downhill slide, but have been doing well after chemo change.  Thinking the vaccine may have helped. Feeling good and hope to live awhile longer.  Thanks to this site, have kept my mental health on an even keel.  Thanks for all your support and advice.  Edited for spelling, punctuation & grammar.

Even afterward, have had problems with the regular gynecologist, so went to the gyn-onc instead. I'm hopeful that you will be able to find someone to help you.  ",

Helical tomotherapy is an emerging highly conformal radiation delivery method which provides megavoltage CT localization and may provide superior conformality and localization compared to other dynamic intensity modulated radiation therapy techniques. We have recently obtained a helical tomotherapy unit in our department and would like to establish a program for treating metastatic disease with highly conformal therapies. Metastatic disease is often treated to less than ablative doses due to its proximity to critical structures and concern for inducing toxicity. Newer conformal therapies offer the ability to escalate radiation dose delivered to oligometastases while minimizing both dose delivered to normal tissue and toxicity.\" Eligibility up to 4 metastases, the largest no more than 5 cm.  The study treats ALL the metastases, up to a limit of 4.  They won't take you if you have mre than 4 mets.  I tried to get in on this study, but was rejected because my largest met is more than 5 cm.  Maybe someone here can put my research to good use. Dx 8/2007, IDC, 1cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 1/1 nodes, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Talked to my brother today who congratulated me on being cancer-free for 3 years.  What the heck has he been smoking?  And he's a nurse, to boot.  So, dear friends, it isn't only our spouses and children who are in denial.... The shoes shopping advice has been a hoot.  Several years ago I inherited a zillion pairs of shoes from my neighbor who was a shoe-a-holic also.  Most of them were new in the box.  At the time I joked that maybe I shouldn't wear them because she had breast cancer and I might catch it.  IT WAS A JOKE!!!!  I'm feeling like I've got a few more years left in me. ",
