I just yesterday went to a new doctor who said that he does not suggest a biopsy. He did however have me take another ultrasound. Should i be more assertive and push for a biopsy or should i get a second opinion?? so many emotions going through my mind. Log in to post a reply",

This is why my first doctor wanted to biopsy it. The second doctor didnt even think twice. right off the bat he came in, didnt even feel it and said i was too young. he sent me for the second ultra sound and a radiologist was there with me saying that although the edges are not rounded he said hes siding with the doctor not to biopsy because of my age",

So ill be a little more specific. I found the lump and reported it to my OBGYN. he referred me to an ultrasound at a breast center. The breast center rated it BIRADS 5. after talking to my OBGYN about my options, he gave me a list of surgeons to do a biopsy for me. I couldnt get an appointment before I moved. So when I got here, I went to the breast center of the nearest hospital, I had my original ultrasound screens and reports faxed over to them. The surgeon didnt even feel my breast!! he said he believed that the original breast center that did my first ultrasound labeled it a BIRADS 5 for insurance reasons.. and he said im too young to be worried. He also said that if I wanted to ease my mind he'll send me for another ultra sound. So I went, radiologist present. He said the shape was abnormal, (the sides were rigid, not smooth) but it was most likely a fibroadenoma. Well, I've had enough!!! I was scheduled yesterday for a consultation and next week I will finally be getting my biopsy. thank you for all your support everyone! i will definitely keep you guys posted on my results. it feels good to have a support system and makes this whole situation a little easier",
