      "Content": "Psychehun wrote: I am freakin out. Last night I took off my bra and felt the sudden urge to scratch an itch under my breasts. After scratching their itch got worse and the redness and warmness spread to my armpit and my back behind the breast. It is extremely itchy and hot to touch. I am really concerned. I have applied Neosporin and hydrocortisone but it has not gotten better. Does inflammatory breast cancer appear suddenly? I have to wait until. Monday morning to call and make an appointment.
