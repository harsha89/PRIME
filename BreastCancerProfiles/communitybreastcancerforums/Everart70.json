    "Content": "Everart70 wrote: Hello friends, My journey has been so frustrating and my brain is so overwhelmed after my follow up appt. Going back to the beginning, in early June I discovered bloody and clear fluid coming from the nipple of my left breast. After a long mammogram appt they discover a cluster of suspicious microcalcifications under my nipple. I went to see a surgeon and he agreed that I needed a lumpectomy to remove the area and biopsy. On August 27th I underwent the lumpectomy. Not a comfortable recovery but after 5 days I was feeling ok. I went in for the results but the it was inconclusive. The pathology discovered atypical cells, possible invasive ductal carcinoma but possibly atypical hyperplasia. Unfortunately they have decided I need another lumpectomy to remove more tissue and this time we are removing a few lymphnodes to biopsy just in case. I'm so frustrated, scared, and exhausted. I'm 35 years old and I have 3 boys. This of course is less than ideal. I absolutely understand that my health is number one and if I'm in fact dealing with cancer then we need to know. I'm so frustrated that I need a second more invasive surgery to get more answers. I wish we could have known the answers with the first surgery. This entire thing feels so surreal. I could use words of encouragement. Log in to post a reply",
