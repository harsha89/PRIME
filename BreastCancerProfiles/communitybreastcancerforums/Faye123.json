Well, i went for my ultrasound & mammo today.  The results came back ok!!!   1st off, they couldnt find anything on the ultrasound. the tech said that she saw what looked like a little cluster of fiberous tissue, but that was normal for a girl my age.  She sent the dr in to double check.  Then i went for my mammo.. about 10min later they told me everything appeared normal.. She said all they saw was a clump of fatty tissue, and that was probably the little lump that i felt.  She said nothing appeared unusual or abnormal about it, and that i should come back in 6mo just to make sure everything is still the same.  Does anyone know anything about fatty tissue? is it something that can appear and then go away..because the lump def felt smaller today than it did in the beginning.. i could hardly even find it when the nurse asked me to point it out to her.  ::sigh:: i'm SoO relieved!!! i feel like i can continue on with my normal life..before it was taken over by worry and stress!  I just want to say thank you to everyone who replied to my previous post! You are all such wonderful and strong women here!  I reaally appreciate the care and support!  <3 Faye  Log in to post a reply",
