I'm sure the docs would say no if I asked. the tumor will be out Monday, so it will be interesting to see if I feel a change once I recover from the surgery",

I'll probably be in bed moaning on my day 7 PFC. I ended up deciding not to go on full time leave - too much trouble and loss of income when I only have one infusion left. I am getting so much support from my department and my school-they are taking things off my plate, so I can manage. So now, I have been working two days a week. My FMLA ends Jan.2. I found out that once that ends, I can stop working altogether, continue towork two days a week, or be full time for the rest of the school year. I am not allowed to increase my hours to anything but full time (I wanted to go to four days a week starting in January). This is what HR says, though. My principal said that there are ways around that.....we'll see. Pretty dumb rules when there is a shortage of school psychologists.  ",

I don't usually drink soda or sports drinks because of the taste/calories, but the Nuun is great. My docs are not automatically giving me Neulasta, which I thought was a given.

Woke up nauseous, had to eat saltines in bed to take my steroids, and, while it helped, I was still nauseous and took another anti nausea med. Tired, but not wiped, but definitely not flying like the last two days. I did do an 18 block walk to take my daughter to/from summer school, and got some groceries and carried them home.

I am pretty wobbly when I walk more than a couple of blocks, even if I'm not tired, so it keeps my husband on his toes.

No hair loss yet, acne from steroids gone, just feet peeling a little. I think I'm going to have 'baby feet' pretty soon!

      "Content": "Sep 9, 2017 12:14AM - edited Sep 9, 2017 12:15AM by Leatherette I think I was itchy because the steroids are supposed to suppress allergic-type reactions, which I haven't had because I never missed the dose before. But I was also anxious and panicky about it, which can also make me itchy. Luckily I had my Zofran with me- puking on top of everything else, in an art museum, would not have been fun. I had a crazy, long busy day at work today. Being on the steroids helped, but I was definitely foggier than usual. I can still do everything, I just have to work to focus much more than usual. And it is definitely harder to keep my food and water intake up at work. It's just non-stop fires to put out and interruptions at work. But I am so glad to have it, and hope I can keep doing it - I'm kind of nuts like that. And my colleagues have been wonderful about everything. I'm lucky to have my second family at work! So, I think I have another good day or two in me, then I'll be \"back in the shit\" days 4-7 to 4-10, depending on how lucky I am this time. Please, please, I need a break from the mouth sores this round! Pink, sorry about the low RBC, bone pain, and appointment mixup. I hope things are better soon, and you don't need a transfusion. \"Fun times\" is right!  ",

Also, when I went into urgent care last week, the staff accessed my port to get blood (after assuring me that they were trained to and did it all the time)and they were able to inject heparin and take a tiny bit of blood, but couldn't get enough for the tests they had to run.

The sores aren't as big as last time, just the location being the tip of my tongue is what's brutal. I had to go in today for my eyes (tearing, gummy, glued shut when I wake up), but ended up leaving with vicodin for the mouth pain. Apparently it is all mucositis. Nothing is infected, which is good. The vicodin is making life a little liveable again. Paulette, I do feel that the L-glutamate helped with neuropathy symptoms. I am not having tingling or numbness in my toes or fingers this time like I did with the first round. It alsomay have helped by giving me the five extra mouth sore-free days this round. I'd say it's worth a try, but check with your oncologist to make sure it's okay with your treatment plan. In some cases, they don't want you to take it. Freya, the Vegemite idea is interesting, but I really don't like Vegemite. I'll keep it in mind as a last resort.",

The little hairs were driving me nuts, And the showers were not relaxing with all that hair all over me. It actually feels really good. I thought it would make my scalp more tender, but it didn't. It feels better. It feels better with the wig, and it looks better than the \" mangy look \" I was rocking. m I happy to have cancer and be bald? No, but taking control of this hair loss thing is better than prolonging the process to me. My husband and my daughter have seen it (well, my husband helped me do it)",

Under both I wear a bamboo wig cap, which is great for keeping my stubble comfy. I walked 4 miles today, because I feel like my normal self and I started the steroids for my second infusion tomorrow. That, I wore a cap for, as the wig would have been way too hot and itched when I sweat. The ponytail sounds great, but my sideburn hairline is really low, and is dark stubble right now, which would blow the ponytail's cover. I may try it when my hair is 100% gone. I hope everyone is ok- this thread is getting a little less active. I think people may be posting more on the August start thread. Or maybe everyone is feeling great and living their lives with minimal side effects! ",

I don't eat any meat, but the thing I have been craving most whenever my taste buds work is saag from a Himalayan place near our house, which is essentially pure spinach. I'm hoping my mouth continues to behave with no sores, and maybe I'll have it tonight. I started using Aveda scalp remedy, and sadly, I can't smell it (love the smell of Aveda products), but my scalp looks and feels better, and my fuzz looks longer. At night I look at my little fuzz halo in the mirror and try not to get too attached to it! It could still go. As far as neuropathy, the L-Glutamine makes it a lot better in about a half hour for me, massage and warm/hot shower help, too. Sunnyjay-I lost my insulated 34 oz cup for a day a while back, and it was totally like losing a security blanket! It cost 20$, so I only have one. Hope everyone has a good weekend.

I wish I could be as cognizant of who is doing what when as some others are, but I am thinking about all of you, wherever you are in the process, appreciating your bravery, humor and willingness to share. My umx was on Monday, was discharged Tuesday, and was able to attend a reconstruction support group Tuesday night with the help of my sister. It was super helpful, and I hope they exist elsewhere. A group of about 15 women were there, told their reconstruction (or no reconstruction) stories, and showed the group their results. I was even offered a feel by a woman who had diep flap, like I plan to get. I got props for being there 1 day post mx (I wasn't trying to be brave - if I didn't go that night, I'd have to wait another month-they meet once a month), but I did start to feel a little woozy at the end, so did not stay to chat. Anyway, that group and having my sister here made it so much better. I had bad side effects from oxycodone (itching all night, all over), so just took ibuprofen. I haven't even taken any today and feel no pain. I never had much pain, but did try the painkillers prophylactically. My mx was skin sparing, and I have to say, the results are hard to look at (puckering, dimpling, visible hair follicles-due to slackness?). I was expecting it, though. The first two days, I only looked at the surgical site, to make sure there weren't problems. When I looked at it next to my remaining breast, it was definitely stark, sad, etc., but I was okay. I am waiting for my coobie bras to arrive, because I'd like to go out more. My remaining breast is a 36DD, and still needs support! There's some chafing as well. Wish I'd thought to get the coobies earlier, but I thought Id just wear my normal bras (underwire!) with padding on the mx side, and even my sports bras are too heavy duty to be gentle to my tender side. Live and learn. So anyways, for those who have not had their mx yet, an example with not a lot of pain, the drain is not a problem, and surviving \"the reveal\". Could not be getting through this without my family andthe thoughtful and generous members of BCO. Next up: Dependent on pathology results- expanders will be placed on July 5, then scheduling diep flap. I am supposed to find out pathology results today or Monday. Feeling hopeful/cautiously optimistic.  L",

I was supposed to call them when my drain output was less than 30 cc's for two days straight, and got it out two days later. Until it was out, I did not realize how much of the problem with discomfort and range of movement was due to the drain! I am practically normal since getting that sucker out. Just no hailing cabs with my left arm! And I empathize with you on the husband thing. Mine, however, wants to help, but sometimes that comes out as questioning doctors a little too aggressively, to the point of talking over me in appointments, and sometimes trying to be funny and saying something hurtful unintentionally. As in, there are some jokes I'm allowed to make, but if your boob hasn't been lopped off, you don't get to. I try not to require mind reading though, just give him my teacher look and say, \"Too soon.\" He's my guy, though, and a good one. Just not always properly filtered. Ask friends for help! They want to help. I also have a mother that is so unhelpful that I can't even talk to her about any aspect of my bc. She would make it about herself. Find the love where you can. I think local breast cancer groups have volunteers that will do things for people- maybe look into that? My kids are 13 and 16, so they are pretty self-managing, and the 16 year old will do things if I ask him to, but isn't naturally empathetic. The 13 year old is a girl who is pretty self centered at this point. But as long as I don't fret about their diets or the amount of screen time they have, they are at least not extra work. I can't imagine having little ones right now, and kudos to those who do and are going through this! My husband 's fever broke today, which is great, but he is still pretty weak and wobbly.

I know JenRuns has to go in to renew, and I don't know about CA, but it may be an option for you, Paulette. Also, third round of chemo today, and it took 5 hours! Then I was out and about and didn't have my dexamethosone with me, so I got that dose late, and started to get itchy all over. I'm sitting here waiting for the steroid to kick in. I'm mad at myself for doing that. I have to get up early for work tomorrow, and hope taking the steroids late won't keep me awake tonight. Arrrgh!  ",

I'm neutropenic and there was no infection to be found, so the theory is that the sore throat is just mucositis. So if this happens again, it will hopefully be during the day when I can talk to oncology staff, because the consulting nurses will always send me to urgent care if my temp is 100.5 or higher. I did call oncology today, and they are not worried. We just found out today that my mother in law's liver is failing and she probably has less than a week to live. My poor husband is getting a lot thrown at him right now. And I am closer to my mother in law than I am to my own mother, by a long shot. It's not a surprise, and we started the grieving process a while ago, but it is still hard. Dang it! Thanks for checking in and worrying about me-I need all the support I can get right now. You all rock. And I am so happy to hear that some of us are getting close to done with chemo!  L.  ",

She had a very interesting life. She grew up in Holland during WWII. Her house was occupied by Nazis, and the kids spent lots of time trying to trick and annoy them. Her best friend at that time was Audrey Hepburn, pre-fame. She went on to become an artist, painting beautiful still lifes, portraits and lots of birds, especially chickens. Her house was always artfully decorated, and she loved hosting dinner parties. And she was always great to me (don't think she liked any other of my husband's girlfriends!).

There was an amazing volunteer there who spent an hour with me. You are limited to what's there, so if you really want it to look like your hair, you may be out of luck. The volunteer told me I can always come back, look, and exchange if they get something new that is closer to what I want. I am pretty happy with that wig- it's a lot like my hair, but black instead of brown. It is synthetic. For some reason, all of the Pantene Great lengths human hair wigs were blonde.  I got a second wig at my treatment center, which has an exchange, so you can use a wig, return when done. This wig looks a lot like my hair does when it is long. It was pretty tangled and damaged, but after a couple of hours of work, conditioning, detangling and trimming, it looks really good. If you like close work, it's do-able, and I have a lot of experience detangling tightly curled hair, but it could have been terribly frustrating.  On other things: It took a while for my stomach to settle this a.m., so I could not walk my daughter to school, which was sad. That has been \"our time\" lately. Runnermum, I love your Monopoly game story. I have definitely been going out of my way to find special time with each kid, and it has been really nice. Definitely blessings to count. They are being so great thru this.  I made a smoothie with banana, peaches, blueberries, yogurt and orange juice, and it tasted good, and I think it will stay happy in my stomach. I made zucchini parmesan last night, which also had flavor. Weird but good SE: my skin feels super soft, don't know why. Maybe all the extra water I am drinking",

And since I didn't get the taxotere this last round, I actually feel much better physically. I think I have \"being strong\" fatigue. Paulette, I agree we have to look forward-it's just that looking forward is a little scary, too. We will never be the same as we were pre-bc, but we can still be pretty great, right? I also feel like there is some wisdom I am supposed to have, to take better advantage of what I have, live in the moment more, attitude of gratitude, etc., but that hasn't presented itself at all! I'm just impatient. I just spent a week trying to get physically un-constipated, now I am just mentally so. So glad we have each other to work through this with.

My old hair grew really fast, was so thick that I had to have it thinned with razors, and I complained about it all the time. I think now I will grow it really long, never thin it, and look like I did in my college/deadhead days! Well, maybe not exactly, but with a lot of wild hair!

Post-chemo is enough on its own, as far as I'm concerned. I have a lingering cough from my flu, but feel fine. Less fatigued. It doesn't make my leg muscles sore to walk up one flight of stairs. The big C is lingering, and my feet hurt in most places and are numb in the others. Hair looking a little thicker/longer each day. You know who popped into my mind when thinking about my hair? Susan Powter, 90's health guru/media personality........committed to \"stopping the insanity!!!\" Her hair could be measured in mm, and she looked good!  ",

I'm obsessing a little over avoiding constipation. Food does not have much flavor, and my mouth and throat are a little tingly. Nausea very bad when I first woke up, but ate some saltines and took an odansetron, and haven't been nauseous the rest of the day. Noticed some red spots on my forehead. Other than that, okay. Walked 24 blocks and drove my daughter to a sleepover. Glad to hear most everyone is doing okay. I groomed one of my wigs today, a free one that needed some love, still looks a little off, but my other one is very good. Now I have two creepy styrofoam heads looking at me",

Last night was like three a.m. at a frat party for me. Woo hoo! Took turns between sitting on the toilet, throwing up, and curling up in a fetal position on the bathroom floor just to be horizontal. That lasted about 3 hours, then I slept for three more, just getting up now. Waiting for peppermint tea to cool off. I sure hope that was a one time thing. That sucked!",

I did not take my antinausea meds that night because i was \"doing so well\" and that was the only time I have thrown up (once). Keep taking your antinausea meds! I got bad acne on day 5 of the first round,but that has not happened again. After day 11 of round one, I had no nausea, and felt fine except for very painful mouth sores (worst side effect IMO), which I had on both rounds one and two. In general, some stomach upset the first few days/loose stools, then trying to ward off constipation the rest of the round, fatigue between days 3 and 12, no sense of taste most of that time, either. I started to lose my hair on day 16 of the first round. The most surprising side effect for me has been eyes that tear constantly, causing dried up tear crust on my face and eyes almost glued shut in the morning. I get a lot of cold waves running through my body, and my hands and feet are often cold, and many days, there is an \"otherworldly \" feeling that isn't quite nausea or dizzyness, but isn't normal, either. I was definitely weaker by the second round. This round, the sense of taste seems to be hanging on more, so I am eating more than I did the first two rounds. I lost about 15 pounds. Starting 8/29, I have been back to work 2days/16 hrs a week. I have been working about 1/3 of the time at home. Alright, enough for now. I hope this helps, but everyone's side effects are different. I feel that I have been doing pretty well compared to what I was expecting. It still sucks, but everything's relative!  ",

I am getting my 5th infusion as I type, and know I can still lose all of it, but I at least think the follicles are still alive! I knew I wouldn't follow through on cold capping, so didn't want to set myself up to fail. Some people have great success with it. I was premenopausal, 45, and had thick dark curly hair withmaybe 5% gray.  ",

If anything, having a real problem has pushed the things I used to be upset about to the background. I do get depressed during the times that I can't do anything for days, but I think that is a normal human response, and once I can do things again, it dissipates. Fortunately, my conditions were well-controlled with meds (wellbutrin, concerta)when bc hit.  ",

Dr. was pretty against that idea, so I stuck it out. I have not gotten the acne again, and the steroids have not made me gain weight. I'm not bipolar, but have anxiety and depression, and if anything, I feel happier on steroids because I can do more. It may trigger mania, but I don't know.    ",
