I wonder if I have the right to refuse Taxol and ask for the Abraxane?  I will be calling tomorrow and hope to get results, why take the chance of all the serious SE and the added pre-meds!  Anyone have any info on this subject? I heard it's more $$$ and insurance requires to try Taxol first but I refuse to allow my insurance co. dictate my treatment... UGH! ok I'm done venting :) Thanks :)))",

Well I met with the BRCA test lady yesterday and decided to do the test, due to my age and lack of medical hx from my fathers side. Today I get to go for a pap-smear and a teeth cleaning! Lucky me  I think I have all I will need in what I call my chemo-carry-on bag, tissues, mints, biotene, lemon drops, gum, advil, tylenol, hand sanitizer etc...even got 2 free wigs which I will most def name if I wear them, also got a beanie, scarf and a book on how to tie a scarf... with chemo starting Monday I was happy to hear from the chemo nurse about the meds and all. I have decided that Sunday is a day for the beach! I am in Oregon and our weather has been beautiful the past few days so time to dip my toes on the sand before I am possibly too ill to do it!  Still very nervous about starting chemo, but I have gotten a lot of info here and a few personal messages from ladies who have been there before me which helps so very much! Thank you all! ",

Didn't even think about chemo which is tomorrow... day 1 cycle 1 of TC.  Being an anxious worrying type that I am, I have to say I feel pretty calm and it's from you all! Now I know I will be nervous but I am so happy to have found this page and to be able to follow all of your journeys! Please speak to your angels, god and spirits for an easy no SE journey for us all! Below is me with my short hair cut and my hubby and 2 of my kiddos! Here's to a good nights rest and no SE!

Then premeds of dexamethasone and zofran, went fine didn't feel anything, then came the taxotere...nothing, then cytoxin...nothing. Man I tell ya it was more time consuming than anything and I was filled with such anxiety and nerves over this and now I think next time should be good! 1 down and just 3 to go. Now I have to admit I am a but nervous about what may come in the following days. I am also one who does not take meds of any sort so this is very hard for me to ingest all this \"poison\" then add more to counteract it's SE...Ugh! But I will do it and do it as I am instructed to in order to avoid as much of the SE as possible :)   Coldincanada: you are so sweet, thanks! Mmtagirl: looks like we are :) I hope I have helped calm you if you needed it, and I will post daily on how I fair. ",

I was angry that day...the day I expected to see my MO then my RO and set up radiation, but still awaiting the final pathology report my MO says lets send off for the Oncotype test...more waiting! UGH!  My journey so far... I am 44 now(had a bday but didn't really celebrate since BC) 1 mammy at 42 found 2 nodes that were fine. 2nd mammy 1/30/got the call back again, I thought oh it's just them nodes again... nope! They saw the same 2 nodes and a strange spot on the right then another mass on the left..UGH! So now it was biopsy time and since the spot on the right couldn't be seen by unsound I had to do a streotactic mammy which I had to do the upright since I can't lay flat on my tummy due to my Chiari malformation... another thing I deal with daily... anyway, biopsies done and yep that spot on the right was IDC and the nodes were clear as well as the mass on the left but the mass was suspicious of another type of growth that could turn into a cancer, so surgery time...I decided on Lumpectomy's.  After a very long 3 weeks the final path comes in and I am stage 2 grade 2 with 1 micro cell found in one node and this is cause for chemo...? my onco score is 16 which is low so I thought no chemo? but since there's a chance of a cell or so roaming around my MO says chemo 4 rounds of TC each 3 weeks apart then 6 weeks radiation then 5 yrs or so on Tamoxifin... I have not taken meds of any kind for the past 6 years, I have a fear of side effects and now I have to take all this toxic stuff to save my life.  Wow! So I worry about what chemo will do to me and how I will get through, any advice or info is so greatly appreciated!  Hugs and strength to you all!  Chemo for me begins 4/14/14",

I know folks react differently but the SE seem similar and seem to be mostly handled by other meds...I too am not one to take anything at all, not that I am sensitive but my fear of SE for any and all Rx's and even OTC I haven't taken anything but vitamins and naturopathic in over 6 yrs, so this is beyond me to put this toxic med in my body! Oh man where's the DONE button?! ",

I have been reading March chemo 2014 for the last 90minutes trying to follow gals with my same TC doses and getting caught up in others too, so many lives smacked with BC and it's amazing the support from newbies and veterans!
