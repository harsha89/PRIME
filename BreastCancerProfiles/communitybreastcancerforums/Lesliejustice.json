They said I had a large amount of density and they wanted to look closer. I began to read up on bc and discovered there were more signs than just lumps. I feel ignorant I never took my breast more seriously. I've gained a good bit of weight over the last year. I honestly try my best not to look at myself naked. I despise my breast because they are big DD and pushing DDD, I'm 42 years old. I decided to get in the mirror and really examine them. First thing that popped out at me was how dented my big breast was. That breast is considerably fuller. My question to the group is how do you know if the indention is from weight gain or a big red flag? Log in to post a reply",
