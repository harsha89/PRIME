    "Content": "JennInspirations wrote: Looking for others who are stage 4 in order to find a support group. Also, I wonder what happens if I do not do treatment? How much time will I have and will that time be diminished or higher quality than with treatment? Chemo is awful and there is no measurable outcome data given to demonstrate it will extend my life or improve my quality of life. I don't know why I am doing this? I went to the doctor and they said 18wks of chemo, double mastectomy, 6wks of daily radiation, 18 months of hormones for a 1-3% of living over 5 years. Wondering if I would rather spend 6 months having fun at the beach, than 2 years being sick, alone, in bed? Log in to post a reply",
