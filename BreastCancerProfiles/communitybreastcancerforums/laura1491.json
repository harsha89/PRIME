I started to read on it and many say that tamoxifen is given for this.  The surgeon said I was fine and there was no carcinoma.  I am also going through gene counselling due to the high amount of breast cancer in my family. Has anyone else ever been in this situation?  Log in to post a reply",

I did not feel comfortable with the answer as I have had two previous lumpectomies they were okay.  However there is breast cancer and ovarian cancer on both sides of the family.  I am the third generation.  I went to my old family doctor and he said no that is a lump he referred me to the surgeon who took out the other two and he gave me two options, a needle biopsy or a masectomy.   I am going for genetic counseling next week and I will have my answer at this point I don't want to wait until a lump shows up that is cancer and I do not know if this one is.  Has anyone faced this head on and just said remove the breast?. ",
