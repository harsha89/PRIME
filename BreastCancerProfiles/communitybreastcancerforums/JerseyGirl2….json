My onc gave me a break to see how I would be feeling after 6 weeks without the drugs and I've turned a corner on health. I'll be stopping the Herceptin, since I've had 9 months of it, and moving forward. This past week, I've had a major turn in feeling \"normal and healthy\" again. That has made a world of difference. I've found that a day can go by without thinking about BC. Laughter has returned to my home, and that is huge. I made a decision NOT to get caught up in statistics, recurrence, etc.. I've found that looking to the future and enjoying life a long the way is huge for me....

DX was in July, had cancerous activity in sentinel node pre-chemo. 5/23 nodes positive after chemo and BMX on Nov. 30th. BS called after path report and declared me cancer free. Saw my MO for post op follow up and asks me what the BS told me, then says, yes, all of that is correct, but we still have to take into consideration the 5 nodes positive (the BS said, tumor shrank with chemo and nodes and tumor were more scar tissue than cancer when removed) So, I was feeling good about the discussion, then she starts saying we have some options to look at here because of the positive nodes...A bit more chemo (she mentioned adriamycin, \"just to be safe\" uh no, the 6 rounds of initial chemo really did a number on my body in the first place. Moving on to the next thing, she mentions Xeloda, if I'd like that. No... Next OK, we continue with the original plan, radiation to mop up anything surgery might have missed, finish the year of Herceptin (I'm Her2+), and add Tamoxifen for a very short period of time to see if my periods come back. If they do, then ovary removal and an AI. If they don't come back in a year, switch to an AI....and 2nd petscan once all treatment is finished after radiation to make sure of all clear. I guess I'm freaking myself out with her mentioning more chemo drugs... I feel like my MO was giving me the \"standard\" discussion to see if I'd do more chemo or something else... then she seemed perfectly happy with my choice to go with the original plan. I'm usually really strong-willed and positive, wanting to push forward and kick this Stage 3 to the curb. This just knocked the wind out of me a bit...

If I don't hydrate well, I get dizzy and feel terrible, just like with chemo. As for the lotions, I can only attest to this... I started using Miaderm a week before and I didn't get pink until the end of week three, which was Friday. On Friday night I looked at myself and realized that I was getting really pink. My mother-in-law had given me this cream called Tri-Derma, and I used it Friday night, twice a day on Saturday and Sunday. Monday morning I got up and my skin looked like it did 3 weeks ago.. no pink, no color, nothing... So, for me... it did something. The techs kept looking at it in disbelief this morning. Anyway, everyone is different, so I guess it depends on the person....",

I'm asking on Monday for her to check my hormone levels. We've briefly talked ovaries out, but not a full convo about it... I'd much rather take an AI, since the studies and trials are showing it works better for ILC patients. Kate, I get dizzy and woozie on the table, too. I think it's dehydration for me, too. However, yes, my mind goes to the dark place whenever it happens. The Ativan question... Mo prescribed it for nausea during chemo. I also was prescribed the other two, but only took Zofran once for an extreme nausea episode. Have only ever take Ativan since. Now I take it to combat the anxiety, and the nausea I get from anxiety and rads... You're not alone... ",

I have my staging for rads on Monday, Jan 4th, then the simulation the following week, so I'll be starting my 6 weeks on Jan. 18th. I'm a bit nervous, but feeling good about moving forward and getting this part done. I've been having anxiety attacks lately, but I think it's just everything hitting me... I had my chem, did BMX, no recon, and now onto rads and Herceptin through July... The surgeons say they got everything, rads will mop up, and soon I'll be on my way... So, my plan is start date Jan. 18th, 5 days/week for 6 weeks... radiation to breast and lymph area, with the final week consisting of boosts to the breast area only. Thank you for being out here!",

They do have these beautiful, low lights that change soft glowing colors throughout treament, which helps a bit, since my head is turned to the left the whole time, at least I can see the pretty colors when I open my eyes... and it's better than chemo! Catfurr, I hear you on the unanswered questions thing... I didn't have a complete response to chemo, and positive lymph nodes at surgery, so I get that they are doing radiation. I was surprised though when they said they were radiating the superclav node... turns out its a good thing, but still, didn't know that going into rads, until they started marking me and I wondered about it out loud. Called the RO on my way home from the appt to ask what that was all about. I hate being my own advocate, and not knowing what to ask sometimes! I hate using the internet to look up stuff about this stupid disease because most times it just makes my anxiety worse.  ",
