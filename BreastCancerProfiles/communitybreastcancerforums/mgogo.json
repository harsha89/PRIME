I had a stereotactic biopsy and a medical assistant called the next morning to ask if the doctor had called to give me the results. The doctor had not called. The MA freaked out that she was the first to talk to me, and said she would have the doctor call me right away. If she was freaked out, it must be bad. The doctor did not call me back until the next day! The results were not that bad - but I was insane with worry. FYI - stereotactic biopsy was not difficult, neither during the procedure nor in the recovery. I had a small bruise and was a little sore, but nothing major. ",
