It kinds looks like the braided lines on the palm of your hand. (the best way I can describe it) It's under the nipple, only in my problem boob. I have no idea how long it's been there because I only recently started using a mirror doing my self checks. Log in to post a reply",

She thinks it's nothing to worry about, but sending me a referral to a breast surgeon anyway. And she gave me copies of the radiologists report from mammo. 1.5 cm axillary lymph node, hypoechoic no increased vascularity, circumscribed margin. 6 cm fibroglandular tissue, no increased vascularity, global asymmetry. The only thing that worries me is I had never felt this lump before, and now it's there. So maybe it's larger now? Idk. I won't get the referral until next week, how long I'll have to wait.
