Did anyone keep some hair on TCH?  Experience with growing back afterward? ",

I am 12 days PFC (woo hoo!) and of course focusing on my hair.  I started taking Biotin supplements a week ago.  I'm wondering about shampoo - I have heard recs for the Nioxin shampoo.  Any other recommendations? I never shaved, and I did not lose 100% of my hair.  I have very (VERY) thin fuzz - mixture of dark/normal-ish hair, white hair and light baby hairs.  Actually, it looks horrific. I probably should have shaved - would have looked better.  At this point I'm not shaving, though. I cut my hair down to 1 inch at the beginning of chemo (my profile pic).  I was very surprised to see my dark hair then.  I have been highlighting my hair for a decade and would describe its former color as honey blonde/light brown.  My roots were so dark (and surprisingly, also hardly any gray).  ",

Hair on my head is growing very sloooooowly.  I have a few wispy hairs that never fell (oh so attractive) and a 5 oclock shadow for the rest.  I hate my wig, but I'm a professional in a corporate/office setting and feel like I have to wear it at work.  I'm afraid I have another 3-4 months of wearing it (as soon as I have a full head covered with hair - even if it is incredibly short - I will go wigless).  I never wear the wig outside of the office.  My preference is for the pre-tied scarves from headcovers.com.  They are really lightweight.  I also have some chemobeanies.  I like the way they look but my head is a little too big for them.  I see a very strong line where the elastic was too tight on my head when I take them off, and I often have to tug at them.",

I have thick hair too, and it's only really started heavily shedding the past couple of days (Day 9/10 post Chemo #2, so Day 30/31 post Chemo #1).  It's very sparse where scarves/wig headband/etc. lie on my skin & rub.  It's actually pretty full on top.  I use the lint roller on my pillow every day, and clean out a drain thing-y in the shower everyday too.  It's itching a lot now but I doubt that buzzing it would help the itching.  I have really sensitive skin so I'm afraid that shaving would lead to all kinds of rashes/problems. It's really helpful to see those growth pictures!  Thanks.",

Wanted to follow up to say that when I saw my oncologist 2 months after completing rads, she thought I looked amazing.  You could hardly tell from looking at it which breast had been radiated. And, more importantly, I have had virtually no limitations/trouble with range of motion in my shoulder/upper arm.  I started with a personal trainer one month ago.  Started easy on the weights and exercises involving my arm/shoulder but have quickly built that up.  I have no swelling, no pain, no limitation on range of motion.  I chalk that up at least partly to the fact that I kept swimming!",

      "Content": "oranje_mama wrote: I just finished 30 rads treatments (25 whole breast and 5 boosts).  I am a swimmer - kept swimming all the way through chemo - and was beside myself at the initial advice of my RO that I should not swim at all in a public pool (chlorinated water) for the duration of rads (common advice).  Working with my RO, we agreed that I could keep swimming, following some preventative measures, until the point that RO advised me to stop.  Well, happy to say that I kept swimming all the way through rads.  And, per my doctor, my skin looked \"fabulous\" at the end.  Thought I'd post my experience here for anyone who wants to keep getting in pool time during rads.  Here's what I did: 1. Do not \"waste\" pool time.  I only went in the pool if I was going to be doing a swim workout.  No \"dips\" to cool off.  Make the pool time count (this meant for me, only swimming 2-3 times per week for about an hour each workout). 2. Use aquaphor generously & be prepared to toss your suit at the end.  From the beginning, I smeared myself with a thick layer of aquaphor in the large square where radiation hits immediately before swimming.  My suit is thoroughly soaked through with the stuff (it is a black, thickish material suit - aquasphere is the brand - so coloration-wise, not really noticeable).   3. Shower immediately following the swim & gently wash the radiated area (I used Eucerin for dry skin wash). 4. General skin care - I followed my RO's instructions religiously all through rads.  For me, this meant using Weleda Calendula cream at night, and immediately following my rads treatment each morning, Calendula lotion (I used Boiron brand) followed by corn starch applied with a makeup brush in the fold under the breast.  (Warning - this is messy - what I would do is bring this stuff with me, and after treatment I would take off my hospital gown, lie it on the bench, and stand over it to apply the corn starch since it tends to fall everywhere). I had redness, a tiny bit of irritation, one spot of folliculitis, and some soreness.  All normal stuff. Never needed any prescription creams of any kind.   So, if you are a swimmer and feeling down in the dumps about being \"beached\" for the duration of rads - I encourage you to talk about this with your doctor and give it a try! :) Dx 11/26/2013, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 12/18/2013 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Chemotherapy 12/18/2013 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 5/7/2014 Lumpectomy: Right Surgery 5/7/2014 Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Radiation Therapy 6/8/2014 Breast Log in to post a reply",

I have a very aggressive (HER2+++) IDC that appears to be small (2cm). MO recommends neoadjuvant (pre-surgery) chemo (with Herceptin and Perjeta - the new \"dual\" HER2 blockade therapy). MO is optimistic that I will have a \"pathologic complete response.\" If this happens, and I choose lumpectomy (as recommended by BS), surgery would mean removing the tumor \"marker\" and a sentinel node biopsy. Cosmetic result should be excellent. Even though I have no family history for BC, MO recommends BRCA genetic testing (because of my age - 42 - and the aggressiveness of the tumor). I am thinking that if the test comes back negative, then I go with the lumpectomy as recommended by the BS. I will be pounding this cancer with: chemo, HER2 dual blockade, lumpectomy, rads & tamoxifen. But I hear of so many that choose BMX. I am wondering if this decision had anything to do with avoiding chemo? Due to the aggressiveness of my cancer, there is no way for me to avoid chemo. Only question on chemo is whether I get it before or after surgery. Before seems like a no-brainer for me because (1) it's the only way I can get Perjeta, the newly approved 2nd HER2 drug, and (2) it should shrink the tumor - possibly completely - and therefore lead to an even better cosmetic result than if I would have the surgery first.",
