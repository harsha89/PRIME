Im really worried I have had fibrocystic in left breast for yrs I had a biopsy in 1999 and it was fine..I went for mamma last wk and then they done a ultrasound. The Dr.told me she thought it was ok but wanted me to see a surgeon for 2nd opinion.I go on Monday but Im so worried because I have had alot of pain in breast and in the armpit area. I did not even ask what she saw just took for granted it was the cyst.",
