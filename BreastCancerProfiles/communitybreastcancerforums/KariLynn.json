It will get better.  The PET is easy - you just lay there.  Is similar to a bone scan - not noisy like an MRI.  They will inject you them you have to sit in a dim room doing nothing (they doesn't want you to read because it makes your brain more active and can attract the dye according to the last nurse I had.) Take whatever you need to to get through the next few days - then it will be done and you can get going with the game plan.  It really will make you feel better to have all of the results in and have a plan. Keeping you in my prayers. Kari",

The next time you'll get to take an easier breath will be when you get your first set of scans that show the treatment is working.  Then you really start thinking, ok, I can live with this. Allow yourself to \"zone out\" for awhile.  It's a normal reaction.  I think it was at least a month from my dx that I found this board and started \"being strong.\"  A lot of that is fake it till you make it!

Hi all, Had my doctor appointment yesterday - did not get good news.  My liver counts are bad and I am starting to get slightly yellow - having liver failure.  Because of this we have to stop chemo as it damages the liver and mine can't take it. Doctor has referred me to Hospice (can give pain treatment but no other medical treatment.)  They provide end-of-life care and try to let me live to the highest quality of life that I can.  I have been assigned an RN who will check on me weekly (more if needed) and help with medical issues (will do blood draws so I don't have to go out  to the hospital.)  There's a social worker who works with patient, caregiver, and family counseling; and an aid who comes three times a week to help with grooming (sounds like I'm a poodle!)  They have delivered a hospital bed, cane, wheelchair and oxygen - I haven't needed that but they said better to have in case we  need it in the middle of the night. Fr. Tom came over last night and helped us talk to the kids about what was going on.  Was tough but he helped a lot and I think it was good. We have a vacation planned July 13-15 to go to El Dorado Lake.  Have rented a cabin that is near the swim area and looks like it will be fun.  My friend Renea and her family live there and I am looking forward to seeing her - haven't been up her way in years!  We've been trying to think of another place to go that the kids might enjoy, will probably just end up in Branson again... Other than this, I'm feeling pretty well - no real pain to speak of.  Tire easily and have no stamina, but have a lot of help so I get to sleep when I need it.  Thanks for all the thoughts and prayers - right now; it's the only medicine I can take!  Hope everyone is enjoying their summer - I hear it's hot out but have been in most of the time and am COLD!  Like the heat whe I get in it. Take care. Love, Kari If you can solve your problem, then what is the need of worrying? If you cannot solve it, then what is the use of worrying?

Did an MRI here Tues and was going to take it to MDA when got a call yesterday confirming the dr appt today. Went ahead and said yes, I'll be there! Anyway, the lesions in the brain are shrinking and are no longer enhancing so she is even more convinced it is not cancer. I was scheduled to do a spinal MRI in KC but not at home and she still wants me to get that - said if it is MS it will show in the spine too. So, I will go to Houston next week and show them this mess then come home and get the spinal MRI and send it to KU. My next head MRI will be in 6 weeks - she says we should still watch the lesions - and we will double the time for the next scan with every stable one. The stuff on the skull is shrinking a little or is stable, I am cautiously optimistic for my PET in Houston. Have really been feeling good lately.

Avoid any infectious people and places and raw fruits.  Day 15-21 relatively good - can come out of seclusion.  Day 22 start again.

Do more than pray for the best - plan for the best.  If you haven't sought out a second opinion from a breast specialist, I suggest you do.  Chances are your dr is doing everything right, but specialists are up on the most current treatment.  This isn't an immediate death sentence but it's nothing to play with either. Take care of yourself, Kari",

Fr. Tom came over last night and helped us talk to the kids about what was going on.  Was tough but he helped a lot and I think it was good. We have a vacation planned July 13-15 to go to El Dorado Lake.  Have rented a cabin that is near the swim area and looks like it will be fun.  My friend Renea and her family live there and I am looking forward to seeing her - haven't been up her way in years!  We've been trying to think of another place to go that the kids might enjoy, will probably just end up in Branson again... Other than this, I'm feeling pretty well - no real pain to speak of.  Tire easily and have no stamina, but have a lot of help so I get to sleep when I need it.  Thanks for all the thoughts and prayers - right now; it's the only medicine I can take!  Hope everyone is enjoying their summer - I hear it's hot out but have been in most of the time and am COLD!  Like the heat whe I get in it. Take care. Love, Kari If you can solve your problem, then what is the need of worrying? If you cannot solve it, then what is the use of worrying?
