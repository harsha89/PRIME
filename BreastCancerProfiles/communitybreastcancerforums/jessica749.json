And yes, if this is bc, which supposedly is one of the easily screened for cancers, imagine ovarian!! All I needed was one pelvic ultrasound at Sloan Kettering to convince me I could never go through it again, let alone every 6 months as they were recommending. Don't get me wrong, I felt the radiologist (who came out and had a look herself after viewing the images she received) did a great job, I was very impressed: it was  much, much more thorough than two others I had done in the last decade (pre bc but under  anxiety attacks) by so called gynecological cancer experts. But yes, because  I know the ability of an ultrasound to pick up an early ovarian cancer is much more limited than a breast mammogram, and I too have my missed bc mammogram story...I just couldn't go through that again, same reason I did the double bmx when cancer was supposedly only in one breast (but no mammogram found it, not palpable)...luckily I was still in stage 1 when it was caught anyway. So yes, very much share your mindset of needing a little bit of peace of mind on the other fronts as we all remain concerned re our IDC.  Good luck to everyone!",

For example, you need a condition such as BRCA, or ADH, or something. Read about it, they list the conditions pretty clearly. I'm not sure that having a fibroadenoma gets you in or qualifies you as a high risk person.  You do not say (unless I missed it) why you are at 'extremely high' risk.  ",

I opted for bmx based on numerous risk factors (ADH, family history) in addition to an IDC (+DCIS) in excess of 2 cm, none of which was palpable or visible on mammogram. I also had been thru lumpectomy in the past for ADH. By the time of my diagnosis, I felt \"done\". I was so relieved that there was an option to put an end to all the drama over margins and screening and breast biopsies. I never wanted to experience any of it again, was in my 40s and didn't care about my breasts. When my surgeon wanted me to get a pre-surgery mammogram, I was bummed. As I walked out of the elevator to the screening facility, I was depressed and anxious and angry to have to be back there and go thru a mammogram again. I never wanted another mammogram, ever. I just was done, as I said. I knew, no matter what I felt about losing my breasts and having reconstruction, I would be filled with greater regret everyday if I kept them. Not having to do radiation was a huge giant bonus. But I admit it didn't factor in as much as a second bc or local recurrence concerns did. Another perhaps smaller factor I considered in addition to those posted above is - if lumpectomy, ask your surgeon how often they need to do a follow up surgery for clean margins. At Sloan I think they cite 20% as the number of cases where margins aren't clear and they need to go back in.",

THis is where informed opinion/informed  JUDGMENT (excuse all caps)  comes in. I just need to emphasize that it's a judgment call. The stats can only guide so far. You must know what is the population studied, from which the stats being quoted, are culled. You must have the ability to know the limits of the study and how far it may / may not apply in a patient's particular case. For example, my MO has routinely rattled of stats to me re particular questions I've had re treatment. At the same time, my MO has said that the stats are based on people whose bc is more advanced than mine. So, the question remains, as my MO will always say, whether there would be the same effect/response etc on \"MY\" bc.  One can PERHAPS reasonably extrapolate \"yes\".  This is where the informed judgment comes in, with regard to what the stats are, the population they are based on/c ulled from, the nature and limits of the particular study. To original poster, MomtoIrishQ\u2026, your bc tagline says P negative, and it also says invasive lobular.  80% of bc as you know is IDC vs ILC.  And hormonal bc usually means (I think) P positive as well as E+  So just beware of the 'internets' in my opinion (which includes these boards, and you might think my opinion!) which may cite stats but they may be based on large populations whose bc profile is quite different from yours.  And  this is why I urge you to seek and spend $ for highly credible second opinion. Okay, I'll try and shut up now. Good luck.",

Just because she only announced this news to the world days before her surgery doesn't mean it was rushed at all. She could have known about - in fact it's kind of likely - she knew about the cancer for several weeks now. It was only announced the other day because she was leaving ABC News for undisclosed amount of time for surgery and as yet to be confirmed/ determined treatment. I'm sure there was no 'rush' and she made her decision with all the deliberateness she needed. It took me just under 3 weeks from diagnosis to bilateral surgery. And two weeks of that was just waiting for the OR appt. I knew pretty soon after diagnosis exactly what I wanted/needed. Was quite deliberate and thoughtful as to the reasons. Have never regretted it or looked back. Why the judgment on Ms Robach as anything less? I do agree though that the line about \"mammogram saving my life' is annoying, particularly because as Dr Love says one really has no idea if that is the case. It's kind of misinformation in the absence of any other information. If only she left out the touting of the mammogram (reminiscent of Andrea Mitchell). In any event, I believe today was Amy Robach's surgery. Hope it went well and the results of testing are all as positive as can be for her.",

So, in response to my prodding, she asked and she was told: it was a 4.  She couldn't believe it, and neither could her not so good gynecologist, who was as surprised as my sister (incredible, right? We both live in major cities, with doctors affiliated with major hospitals, etc.)  So THEN, and only then, did her gynecologist send her for breast ultrasounds, too. I've been thinking about it a bit over the last couple of years, and we've discussed that maybe she should step it up to MRIs.  This thread reminded me.  I emailed her a couple of weeks back, and she said she'd look into it. Today I phoned and basically yelled at her (lovingly!).  Upshot: she just emailed that she is booked for MRI next week and insurance is covering due to \"family history\".  (me, and maternal grandmother pre-menopause;  our mother post menopause/age 70).  I as her sister am so relieved she is doing the MRI screening with her family history/age/density.   Thanks everybody at breastcancer.org for educating/ discussing / provoking thought / reminding me, so someone like my sister who never visits here can still get the benefit of collective, potentially life saving, wisdom.",

What a celeb might be concerned with more than you is a certain cosmetic thing. They may have different real considerations. And obviously, in Angelina Jolie's case, she had a genetic mutation. If you don't have the BRCA gene, then that's that. Angelina got her BMX because of that, and it was a very sound decision. Ms.Robach: we have no idea. There are many, many possibilities that could have led to her decision, but it's useless to speculate about them. One of which could be that she doesn't care about the stats on survival: it may be that the only thing she's thinking is that she never, ever wants to go through a mammogram and breast cancer surgery again insofar as she can control it. Even if her statistical odds of local recurrence or new bc are very low: they are real, they are there, and she might want to assert as much control over the situation as possible. She is young, her life is threatened, she has two small kids, this is entirely reasonable to me. I don't understand why this perfectly understandable reasoning is so discounted by so many. Overall survival is one thing. I understood perfectly well that my overall survival re the bc I was diagnosed with would not be affected in any way by my decision to do a BMX. It was other reasons. There are valid reasons women have BMX w/o BRCA and without 'needing' to. It doesn't mean we don't understand overall survival stats, or that we are rushed or ill informed or operating out of fear, in the most insulting way that is meant. Because of course there are a lot of things we do, and don't do, out of fear, and that's good!",

Is there a way to further research the providers at CC you might meet with? Is it an oncologist first, or a breast surgeon? Find out who they all are, focus in on the ones you might trust most.

The science might be unclear, and my doctors might not be able to know things with certainty or guarantees, but I absolutely look for guidance/confident judgment. I couldn't handle them telling me to go on intuition. Also, I agree with you re diagnostic mammogram. If your breasts are very dense, and if nothing showed before, I'm not sure what could give you and your doc any confidence that anything will show next time! \"Diagnostic\" or not... While I posted elsewhere about how I myself have never sought 2nd opinions, this is a case where I would! Also re ADH- I had such a diagnosis after palpable lump discovered on exam some yrs back. BS offered T, I didn't take it as risk seemed too great. BS had me screened via mammogram every 6 months. Unbeknownst to all my \"experts\" I put blind trust in, and prior to breast density laws enacted in NY which now ensure patients are informed unlike I was, bc grew inside undetected. I had no knowledge of the density issue. Purely by LUCK I got to another expert who told me to get an MRI where my bc was discovered. And it was pure luck. Good for me to remember that - how absolutely lucky I was.... Once i was diagnosed, I decided to get a bmx. I'm not sure if it took me 24 hours or the weekend to decide, but once I decided, there was no going back. It was a decision i have not regretted. I wasn't interested in a lifetime of screening apps -annual mammograms and ultrasounds and MRIs, the biopsies and false alarms that might then accompany, and the elevated risk, btwn bc, ADH, family history, etc , that I'd carry. I also realized how it was by pure luck my bc was discovered at what i hope was an early, curable, stage, and that I may not be so \"lucky\" the next time. (Hoping that I truly did escape it this time- final chapter not yet written!). To me, I weighed solid medical considerations going forward, the screenings, the costs (emotional), the limits, my higher risks of which ADH was now one of several. Of course, your situation is different. I would at least seek second opinions from the most expert people you can manage. And I would absolutely get u/s in addition to mammogram. You express concern that screening didn't show your ADH but that's not so alarming as ADH is a benign condition, and in a sense it doesn't really matter that the condition never showed. Your concern is that screening show when there is cancer or if luckier a pre cancer DCIS. So far, so good, on that front.",

I was entering surgery a Stage 2 when I had had about 4 mammograms at said cancer center in the last 3 yrs, none of which showed anything (the 4th taken just before surgery, confirming that according to mammography, \"nothing\" was there but the biposy, ultrasound, and MRI disagreed).  Mammographically \"occult\" is what I was told I was. When I  asked the radioligist why, if I my breasts were dense, no one ever told me to use another screening modality, she told me I actually wasn't \"that\" dense, i.e. rated 4 dense, but rather  I was merely a 3 on scale of 4 (1-fat 2- fibroglandular or something, and 3 - hetergenous, 4 - dense). Okay, everyone, I'm here to tell you thaf ic you are rated 3, like I was, you are dense enough for 2.2 cm not to show.  When I then asked the BS why the medical community urges mammograms/clinical exams and meanwhile I wasn't the first she's seen for whom there's a large mass not palpable, and not visible on the mammogram. She replied that there is such a substantail number of women who do not get mammograms, for whom mammograms would be effective.  My personal opinion is that the medical establishment for lack of a better word does not want to undermine their own massive public health campaign to get more women in for mammograms. I don't see why honestly informing women with dense breasts about the need for additional screening tools would undermine: why it can't be more informed. I wish it were for me, and I'm certainly doing my bit to inform my friends, family, etc.",

So, perhaps your MO didn't mention it because it doesn't mean very much right now outside of the oncotype--maybe the oncotype info will trump whatever the ki67 is.

So having had ADH, and having later (5 yrs or so, later) developed IDC, here's my \"been there, done that\" rap for you: Ask your doctor if the ADH is all removed. Ask if and by how much your odds are of having it recur, and/or in the other breast. Ask by how much more your risk of breast cancer, in the ADH breast, or the contralateral breast, is increased. Ask how, now that you are at elevated risk by virtue of your ADH, you will monitored in the future, given that you are 51 and mammograms are known to be, in the best of hands at the most advanced #1 rated cancer centers, to be only \"at best\" 80-85% accurate (as per Larry Norton MSKCC public lecture 2 yrs ago-probably available on their website still). If they tell you that your breast density rating is only 3, not the highest 4, and therefore mammograms will pick it up, tell them no, that's not true; you know someone whose breast denisty was rated 3, and who had mammograms at MSKCC, and the 2 plus cm abnormality biopsied as invasive cancer, easily visible on u/s and mri--was NOT visible at all on mammogram up until and through the days before surgery....(that someone would be me). If they suggest that you can take Tamoxifen to cut your risk of developing bc in half, ask them what happens if you are in the other half, ie. if you DO nonetheless develop bc while on the tamoxifen: will your bc be E-/more aggressive/ a bc untreatable by Tamoxifen? What are the ramifications of taking a drug prescribed for cancer when you don't have cancer???? I recall the surgeon cavalierly suggested that I could take tamoxifen after the ADH biopsy, and rattled off the side effects, which were frankly, to my 44 yr old non cancer patient ears, frightening.  Request that you sepak to a MO about it, frankly. I regret I didn't fully examine the question by someone more qualified to answer i.e an MO vs a (however highly qualified) breast surgeon. I also regret that, in ignorance, I didn't insist on greater surveillance, as I naively believed that mammograms were 98% effective as screening and the 1-2% error rate was a technician skill thing.  SO WRONG I was. I have no idea where that ignorance came from.  ",

It is to help guide and another piece of info-arguably superior info - even the testmaker's own corporate website would probably tell you that. Also- I don't know the answer to this but maybe you want to ask your MO about the extent of validation testing that's been done re oncotype on lobular, vs ductal.  And if this is relevant.   (Also keep in mind that the reason oncotype test makers themselves say it is a tool because the test is in and of itself limited- albeit the best we have today. For example, what is the risk beyond 10 yrs particularly if you are diagnosed young?  Oncotype has not been studied that long and I think most studies are based on post menopausal median age 60 type thing...) I would also urge you not to base important treatment decisions for yourself on things like less-than-competent nurses.  If you are unhappy with treatment at this place, by all means, go elsewhere for additional opinion or even treatment but make it a superior second opinion place (nci - ccc).   Chemo sucks - no two ways about it.  But it ends.  And most get through it successfully. If indeed you are the mother of 4 young kids, you owe it to them to do everything best recommended for cure. Heck, even if you had no kids-of course you would owe it to yourself to do everything best recommended for a cure!  It's great you contacted your CA mo for a second opinion but you might want a third opinion and why not get one from MD Anderson if you are not too far from there. Pick someone with some YEARS of experience at a place like Anderson to counter your MO who sounds fine/good but young (and with poor nurses!)",

A friend once indicated that I might now want to go to MSK because it could be a depressing or scary place. Her mother had bc, then had a recurrence years later, and both times avoided MSK. (live in NYC). I felt/feel the opposite. Like you ann, I urge you Janeway and others who are fortunate to live near top centers to take advantage of it by at least getting second opinions there -- if not your treatment. I don't work for MSK but frankly might sound like I do in the sense that I could rave about them: if you think they are scary, let me tell you, I don't think there is a place where receiving your breast cancer care could be more, well, caring, and comfortable. I often say thank you to Evelyn Lauder under my breath when I visit. It is a very nice, very welcoming, very comfortable center (the breast center--named after Lauder--a building exclusively devoted to the care of us). And it's not just a physical thing, it is the people, from the greeters in the lobby door to the ones at reception when you walk off the elevator. Everything, everything, is very patient friendly. They even book all your appts for you when dealing with scheduling your next stuff is overwhelming. You become spoiled, because you are left to fend for yourself in other places. There are so many resources to take advantage of there, or not if you choose not to. Okay. I just don't want you to be scared. Because it's as kind, comfortable, and welcoming a place through its breast center building on 2nd ave and E 66th st as any hospital where you receive treatment can be. I have always felt very fortunate to be able to receive treatment there.  Good luck with everything.",

Your daughter looks gorgeous in that photo!  LIsten, it is so easy to think the worst when you are at the point you are at now, and that is a terrifying point in the journey: where you are led to believe you have something that is cancer, but you know nothing more.   It is also terrifying if this has been in your family and/or your mother had an early death adn you are similarly aged/positioned with young child. Your fears are so understandable for any woman, let alone your particular history.  Please dismiss everyhting the tech said to you.  The tech knows nothiing with regard to diagnosing...projecting their own fears and dramas and those  of others onto you...why are people like that allowed to work in such a field? But the radiologist knows something, and if the radiologist wants it biopsied, it's something that should be  biopsied obviously. Different places operate differently, but I went somewhere where they didn't keep things secret from me only to relay info to my gynecologist who would break it to me. In fact, my gyno was completely out of the loop and good thing she was as she was useless entirely.  Entirely.  Never really returned to the gyno.  See someone else now. My breast screenings were always done at Sloan Kettering, and when there was a question about anything on a mammogram or an ultrasound, absolutely the radiologist came to me and told me and when I did have something 'suspicious', the radiologist did examine with an ultrasound, did comment rightly or wrongly to me about how it looked (something to the effect of questionable/not great/ needs to be biopsied and are you free for us to do this TODAY?????? which of course sent me into a panic that it was so bad looking she wanted me to stick around TODAY until someone was free to biopsy....) I want you to know that even though during this awful waiting period, when I thought my life would soon be over, it all turned out to not be half as bad as it appeared at the beginning. The imaging pre-surgery all turned out to be worse looking than the post surgery pathology.   Please take some reassurance in the fact that you had an ultrasound in December. It is so likely that nothing was there in December, so whatever you have has grown quickly in the interim and you will now take care of it. It is so unlikely that you would go from nothing to stage IV in such a short time. Please try and be calm. You will soon have answers you need. If worst suspicions are confirmed, you will take the steps you need to and, once you have your plan of action, you will be in a much better place than you are now.",

I think it's seen as an 'advance' to remove less of the breast when the results are the same insofar as death from the disease. For some reason it's seen as an advance to remove less of the breast, when it's not like that with other kinds of surgery, especially on parts of the body we don't need. Seems there's lots of 'judgment' around the breast\u2026! No one cares whether I take out my whole thyroid or just the growth on the thyroid. Surgeons don't push one way or the other, at least in my very limited experience they didn't. It was kind of up to you. Sort of like the breast thing was, only I felt TONS of judgment and opinion about that. While breast cancer deaths maybe the same btwn lump. and mast. candidates, I think there have been studies that show that if the left side of the chest is radiated, there is a higher risk of heart issues later?",

I don't think it has anything to do with one being better than the other, just that if you have a recurrence locally you can't , I don't' think, get radiation again-it must be a single mastectomy. This is why pretty much anyone who has a local recurrence or second primary after lumpectomy gets a single (or bi) mastectomy\u2026.And boy hindsight is 20/20 there! Definitely would have gone back in time and done it all mastectomy the first time.",

I had a lump on my thyroid years ago. I was in my early 30s.  The internist said it was probably nothing.  \"Not to worry\". That most of the time - \"95% of the time\" he said, they were nothing, just something viral. But to see an endocrinologist. When I saw the endocrinologist a week later (on a Friday, I remember very well), he scheduled me for a biopsy on Monday morning. I was so worried that he was acting with a sense of slight urgency re diagnosing me.  I remember he told me to come in before the regular patients started, because he was so booked for the week, etc.  That night I had dinner with friends, one a surgeon's daughter. She told me, \"OH don't worry: if they were really worried, they would have biopsied you on the spot.\"  I thought: be he was really worried--his assistant had left early so he was on his own in the office and couldn't biopsy me on the spot, and he's having me come back first thing Monday morning before the rest of his patients arrive, squeezing me in ahead of everything.  She was trying to make me feel  better, but it actually made me feel worse, realizing even more his sense of urgency would have been to do it that afternoon had he not been alone in his office save for the secretaries at that point! Turns out it was all benign. But he was prudent, and he was one of the top endocrinologists in Manhattan.  I can infer a high medical professional standard of care from this, that if  there is a 5% chance-- a prudent, competent doctor isn't going to let that slide--a 5% malignant chance must be ruled out, sooner, not later. So think positive, and don't let the fact that they are checking you out as a priority over others make you think anything other than they are being prudent and know what they're doing. That you are being taken care of as you should be.   Will check back to see how you're doing, post an update.",
