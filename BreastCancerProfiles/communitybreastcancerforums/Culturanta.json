I too am in limbo after an abnormal screening mamm and then another abnormal diagnostic mamm. I have a biopsy next week. We are all in this together. I've simply decided that I am going to be OK no matter what. I have found many, many stories on the different boards from our fellow sisters who are 10, 20 and even 30 years beyond their cancer diagnosis. If I have cancer I am going to be one of them and if you have cancer, so are you!!! So if we're going to make it through anyway, why worry? Something that is very helpful to me is that I allow myself 15 minutes a day to worry myself sick about this situation. I can either use the 15 minutes all at once or use them in smaller increments throughout my day. The rest of my day I just don't think about it. I am very neurotic and a hypochondriac by nature so believe me this is hard to do. But I am managing to do it and I share it with you in the hopes that it may relieve some of your anxiety,  Best of luck and keep us posted!  Lori",
