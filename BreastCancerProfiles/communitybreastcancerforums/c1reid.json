I had a radial hysterectomy followed by 6 weeks of chemo and internal radiation. A few months ago i found a lump in my right breast which when i pressed on, discharged yellow sticky fluid from nipple.Cut a long story short,rather than waiting to see my gp as it was the weekend i went to emergancy clinic where a nurse examined me and said she didnt feel anything (i felt rather stupid) i got her to take a sample of the discharge and that was it. I figured as she said she couldnt feel it and i didnt hear back from the swab results not to worry. However the other night in bed i brushed against my breast and it had gotten bigger,now discharging a brown sticky liquid when pressed.Went to my gp straight away who didnt sugarcoat anything and told me he wasnt going to lie,he thinks its suspicious and now im waiting on a appointment for my referral to the breast cancer clinic....what happens now? Im scared, im angry with myself for not going about it sooner but im a year in remission,i didnt think id be that unlucky and tbh i want to run away from this rther than face it. Is there any other cancer survivors who have went onto have bc? Is there a link? Â Im trying to think positive but i cant think it will be anything other than cancer. My cc was stage 1B but graded 3, no lymph node involvement but as it was aggressive thats why i had furthur treatment. please someone help me. Im crying now, id just had my baby when diagnosed before,he's nearly 2 now,i have my daughter at 8,i dont want to go through this again Log in to post a reply",
