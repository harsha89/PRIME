I am BRCA 2 positive and have a predisposition to ovarian cancer since my biological mother passed from ovarian cancer at an early age . I am approaching her age when she died now . I will be facing removal of my ovaries and tubes as soon as they can come out , trying to complete menopause if I can with careful monitoring . I also fear the lack of detection with the waiting . I am more worried about my ovaries than breasts , but I am considered high risk for breast cancer and have been told that I should have the mastectomy done . With the careful monitoring is it very possible they could miss a cancer if I wait and see ?",
