      "Content": "CodyCat wrote: Okay, so, I have hypochondria and extremely bad anxiety. I googled my symptoms, which I know is a bad thing to do. By the way, I'm 21, and have no family history of breast cancer. Just thought I'd say that before getting in with the other details. I've noticed, under both of my breasts, right under the nipple is a small dimple. They are close to the same location on each, but look a little different. One looks like a straight line, and one you can barely see. Ive taken pics and you can see it more in the camera roll. I don't feel the dimples, but I can see them. One looks like discoloration, like a bruise. I do squeeze there, rather hard, when checking my breasts. The reason why that one freaks me out badly is because I saw a picture of a dimple on a lady's breast that looks a bit like mine on my left. I'm sure all breast dimples looks pretty much the same, but it's a bit different than the one on the right, but maybe because my left breast is a bit bigger and saggier. The thing is I rarely do self breast exams, I haven't paid too close attention to my breasts, until this anxiety. Breast cancer never crossed my mind. So, I don't know if these were there before or not. My aunt says that having some dimples on fat boobs is normal. My boobs are a bit saggy, I am a bit overweight. I assumed, maybe it's cellulite. I do have that around other parts of my body. When I stretch the skin above my chest, and look at those locations, I don't see any dimples, I only see them when taking pictures with the flash of my phone. With my arms raised up. I don't see them standing normally. Is this a good sign? Would a IBC dimple show even when skin is stretched? I do have an appointment July 9th to see an OBGYN (for different reasons, but I'll bring it up when I see her.) Do you think I should be concerned? I heard IBC is EXTREMELY rare, especially with my age group. I just want this anxiety to go away! :( Also, I should inform that I do not have any other symptoms. My breasts aren\u2019t red or swollen, my nipples are normal, they aren\u2019t too hot. No itchiness. I have pimples in my breast,though. I do, however, have this back/shoulder pain that comes and goes. I heard that could be a symptom, too! ðŸ˜° Though back and shoulder pain have MANY other causes that are not cancer related.
