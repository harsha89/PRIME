I am meeting w/ the staff today & have called for info regarding Hospice. I am hoping Hospice will be the bridge I need to get pain management for her, regardless of other guardian. The courts created a nightmare w/ this decision, but I am determined to do my best. We are appealing the co guardian decision....in the mean time, I just do not want her to hurt. Bev was diagnosed with Rett's Syndrom at the age of 2. That makes it much tougher to guage some of her facial features, but I am taking your list & determined to get somone to pay attention to me..... ",

I have a wonderful team attempting to help us deal with the other guardian & this & other issues. I needed to know from people who can communicate if this is painful. You have all beed so helpful. Trust me, we have lawyers, courts, ombudsman & social workers involved & are willing to go to whatever length necessary to make her comfortable. Kathy",

Unfortunately, the court decided instead of removing this guardian, they would add me.....meaning she & I have to agree on issues.....believe me when I say I am doing everything I can to get Bev the help & comfort she needs. I have to do this by dealing w/ a snake. It is all a control issue.....Today I spoke w/ Hospice & am hoping to get agreement to add them to the care plan. Yes, we have appealed the courts decision..... ",

It is stage 4 & is on her skull, her low & mid back, her ribs, her breast tissue & her liver. She has been given 6 months to 2 years to live, depending on how she responds to medication (monthly injections of Faslodex & Anastrozole.) She is 48 yrs old, severely handicapped & unable to communicate. Can someone hear talk to me about pain. I want her to be comfortable & the other guardian is refusing to allow pain meds, other than Tylenol. I don't want to overdo meds, but really don't want her to suffer. She was crying the other day......any information is appreciated...... Log in to post a reply",
