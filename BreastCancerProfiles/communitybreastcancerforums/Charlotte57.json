These tablets are homeopathic & natural, but I know some natural stuff interfers with treatment. After the first bone pain incident I brought them in and got clearance to use them. A life saver for the muscle & bone pain I've had. One night I got up to go to the bathroom and was in screaming agony. My dh brought me 3 of the tablets I dissolved under the tongue & in minutes I could move! All those years of exercise paid off in a big way as I've used these tablets for years! Available on Amazon and health food stores. (Now I'm disabled & can do little exercise, so memory in this case was a healer!",

Having issues with the muscle aches and bone pain I decided to ask my MO if I could use a product I've used for years when muscles were over taxed (like with excercising or yard work). She read the ingredients and gave me a green light to use it! I was hoping for relief of the overall muscle concerns but was very surprised (and happy!) to find it took away the pain in my bones from the Neulasta! A life saver for me! The product is natural and is called \"T-Relief\". I get the tablets online at Amazon, but you can also get them at a health food store. Check with your doctor first! I told mine I'd report back with the results and maybe they can look into it more and offer this treatment idea to others. (Oh - am taking Clariton but that didn't take care of the pain. Continuing it as it's working for my allergies as well!)",

Not really too worried about it as I am not finding any of the chemo effects very fun, though I feel like \"why should I complain?\" I saw friends years ago go through this without some of the drugs we now have (like puking all the time). Then I say heck - I hate this anyway! This plain sucks! Waiting for the hair to go. Lucky the haircut I got to prepare for hair loss is really horrible so I'm hoping that'll help. Chin up all!

Going into chemo I was already not in the best of health, so I'm wondering where are those days \"off\" you're supposed to have between rounds? Today will be my second AC round followed up by Neulasta. For bone & muscle pain my T-Relief tablets have been a God send! I'm so glad my MO cleared me to take them! I don't know how I would have made it without them! Will be trying the yogurt several of you suggested this time. Of course the Clariton! Funny I'd tried \"everything\" for my allergies and the only thing that had worked was Clortrimaton - which was a pain as you have to take it every 4 hours. Started the Clariton for the Nuelasta and it turns out it works on my allergies! I knew I had tried it before & it didn't work - so here's a positive for me out of this journey",
