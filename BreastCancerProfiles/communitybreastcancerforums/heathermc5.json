The onc sent me to my primary care physician. She felt it was allergies, prescribed albutoral and nasal spray. Didn't work, so my onc ordered chest xray and thought it might be acid reflux and sent me home with prilocec.Chest Xray didnt show anthing, good news, but the cough and pressure is getting worse. My last PET showed Thymic Rebound and onc now thinks it could be that or enlarged lymph nodes putting pressure on my chest. Ordering PET so we will see..... Has anyone had any of these symptoms?? Thank you! Heather Log in to post a reply",
