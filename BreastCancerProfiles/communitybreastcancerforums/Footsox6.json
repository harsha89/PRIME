My chest, and underarms still feel totally crappy. My armpits are still numb for the most part. I feel like someone has tied a rope tight around my chest and it is pinching under my arms. Does anyone else's incisions feel like this? Does it ever get better? I have been doing stretching exercises since right after surgery. I have a pretty good ramge of motion in my arms, but when I raise both arms straight over my head there is such a tightness under my arms. I am so fed up with it feeling this way. I am wondering if it is my crummy surgeon (who gave me really bad incisions) or does everyone's incisions feel this way for this long? I am now 8 months after surgery. Please tell me how your incisions feel 8 months or a year or so later. I am very depressed about this. Thanks for your help and telling me how your chest feels months after surgery.

I have now made it through chemo and am hoping to get back to normal now (a little more hair would be nice). I have this tickle in my throat and sometimes a slight tickle cough. I have had it for about 3 months. Could this be a sign of lung cancer? It is definitely not like a cold or flu. It is definitely not a hacking cough or a deep cough. And it only tickles me maybe once a day, but it is definitely there. Has anyone experienced this? I had a CT scan done before the chemo, in July. Wouldn't they have found something then? I will see the doctor next week and will bring it up then. I was just wondering if anyone else has expericned this. Thanks so much for any info or insight. Yolanda Log in to post a reply",

I am hoping someone who has had breast cancer that turned into lung cancer will see this post and reply as to how they found out about their lung cancer. Perhaps it was some scan or maybe they had the same symptoms. I hope someone like that will post here. I know that we are all kind of paranoid about other cancers, but this is a strange cough/tickle thing, so that's why I am figuring it out. Hopefully I will get more replies. Thanks so much! Yolanda",
