Tomorrow is my last treatment and my skin has started to recover since the whole breast radiation discontinued last Fri. and just the boost to the tumor site has been delivered. I would advise you to watch the armpit area -- I got really, really burned there and didn't know until it was too late that the area was in the field.  Use your creams that they recommend on that area too.  It is  a problematic area to deal w/because of the skin chafing w/normal movement.  Good luck.  Karenanne",

Everyone seems happy to answer my questions, so I'm satisfied they are as safe as they can be w/this.  As much as I don't like the potential long term side effects, I like the idea of cancer coming back less!  Karenanne",

Rads start board but actually started late Dec.  I have 12 sessions to go so I'm actually farther a long than most in my Jan. group and I have a question for those who are at my level or ahead.  I have a burned place under my arm and just got the Silvedine cream for it, which helps a lot.  My chest is very red, a slight bit itchy, but not bad.  Is there any hope that I will plateau at this level, or does the worsening ocurr at the same progression as it has up until now?  Will the Silvedine keep the existing spot from getting much worse?  I  really can't take a break from this and I'm afraid my skin is breaking down faster than I'd hoped. I really didn't think I'd be this crispy until next week.  Thanks for any insight.  Karenanne",

I'm pretty raw around my nipple and that is near the incision they'll be boosting so I am worried about it. I'm going to try to concentrate on how much better my other burned places feel not getting the rays anymore!  Thanks. Karenanne",
