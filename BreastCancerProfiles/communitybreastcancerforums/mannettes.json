I am her2 positive and they now want to do 5 weeks radiation with sixth week boost to the tumor site and under my arm. The tumor was on my left side, low and close to the chest wall. I have a heart murmur and high blood pressure. Had chemo before surgery with pertuzamub and herceptin both which can damage the heart. I am scared and don't want to do radiation. I have a hard time trusting the doctors because I know that they're goal is just to kill the cancer whether they over treat you or not. Any lasting side effects, they are really not concerned with, such as neuropathy from chemo. I have read one article that seems to hint at herceptin causing her2 cells to be more sensitive to radiation, to put it simply. But there really haven't been extensive studies about her2 and radiation treatments effectiveness against this cancer. I am terrified of radiation and the side effects, which are numerous. They are different than chemo side effects in that many of radiations side effects don't go away after treatment. They want me to have a mammogram three weeks after lumpectomy but this is 18 days after and I am still sore and have swelling. I can't imagine getting a mammogram with swelling and soreness. Sometimes I feel as if they are so insensitive to how tender the breast area can be even when things are normal.Â ",
