After years of \"clean\" 3D mammograms and letters saying come back next year for your annual, I made an appointment with a breast surgeon and described to her my concerns. I had markedly different fatigue for the past year and my left breast felt off somehow. Heavy was the only way I could describe it. No one could find my tumor as my small breasts were very dense and the mass was close to my chest wall. I think as well that when my cancer moved from DCIS to IDC, my body was fighting fiercely to contain it. I live on a farm and do a lot of physical work at times. I would literally work for an hour then have to come inside and lay down for 15 minutes to recharge. I knew something was seriously wrong. This newer level of fatigue was occurring the two months leading up to my diagnosis. That little voice inside my head was screaming at me to do something! I am so thankful that I found a cautious doctor who listened to me and reacted by setting me up for an MRI. My recovery from the BMX has been longer than I thought it would be. My energy levels I am happy to report are beginning to crank up again. I am doing (gently) work outside and painting in the house. Tasks that I couldn't have done last year. The anti hormonal meds definitely slow me down. I would say I am running about 70% of my old energy level. So I am focusing on nutrition and proper exercise and feel I am making headway. Just remember this is a marathon, not a sprint. There is a lot of emotional upheaval that comes along with this experience and you have to find ways to work through that. I found that yoga with a group of cancer warriors and meditation have been extremely helpful along with some acupuncture. So get the rest you need, when you need it. Be gentle on yourself and allow things to flow. You will be feeling much much better as time goes by. Good luck on the April 22 surgery. It will be here before you know it. ",

So once you get it out of there and get your primary treatment completed, your body will have all that energy that was working so hard for you behind the scenes. For me that recovery has been a little slower than I would like but remember you expend a lot of emotional energy with this diagnosis as well. I know at least I did and sometimes still do. It will get better but you are still in the center of the storm. Take it easy on yourself, you are processing a lot right now.",

I would caution against changing size too much if going direct to implant simply because you don't want to overstretch the skin. Not only do you run the risk of damage, but IMO your recovery is a little more extended because you were so stretched.

I had my BMX in June and still struggle with varying levels of discomfort and tightness. And it always seems to wind up at night. My current challenge is discomfort in the center wall of my chest. Upon dialogue with my PS, found out that my surgery wound up not being a true prepec placement. She cut some of the muscle and put the leading edge of the implant underneath so there would be a prettier transition as I was so thin. So when I lay down at night the foobs try and drop a little to the sides, pulling on that musculature and discomfort! So I have taking to wrapping myself with an ace bandage before bedtime to keep those foobs in place and it helps somewhat. And I sleep propped a little upright. I continue to have massage which helps release my truncal area. And I have also begun acupuncture which helps with the tightness and my hot flashes. My massage therapist also suggested I try a fascia massage tool to use on my own in between treatments and that is helping. Sorry I wish I had some suggestions for you to try. But I do agree with you that it winds up being cyclical. You have your worst symptoms at night, so you begin to dread the odyssey of trying to sleep through the night, which in turn makes everything worse because you tense up. I hope the CBD oil can begin to give you some relief.",

Even though it means more anxious waiting time for you how horrible would it be for someone to tell you one thing, then reverse it two days later (unless it was good news at the end of course)? I would imagine there are some tumors that are obviously malignant upon removal, but even in that instance, your surgeon is wanting to have additional information that is important such as confirmation that margins are clear. I hope you get good news in a few days. Sorry you are having to go through all this.",

You want to make sure you have enough range of motion so do your doctor directed exercises once they clear you to do so. I was only driving myself, however, and I started with shorter distances because I live on a very curvy road so I had to be very careful starting out. Much easier if the area you have to drive (say back and forth to school) is mainly straight roads. I would factor that into the equation. Also be very careful with opening and closing car doors! That counts towards that \"weight limit\" they give you initially. Best of luck on your surgery.",
