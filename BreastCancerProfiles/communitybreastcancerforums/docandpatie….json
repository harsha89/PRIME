My geneticist told me it really was in the research phase and they think that maybe it has to do with a slightly increased chance of ovarian cancer. Thanks to the responses here in this forum, I think I am going to go ahead and get the hysterectomy and oophorectomy early next year. I have a stage 1A breast cancer ER/PR positive Her negative and so lucky it was caught in the early stages. However, I am having ACT chemo to decrease my chance of mets from 20% to 9% which in my book is huge. Now that all my genes are negative except for this one, I want this possibility gone as well. I am in my late 40's and have had my children and the Tamoxifen afterwards will put me in menopause if all this chemo has not already. So what is the point of carrying around these organs that have no purpose except to possibly cause problems in the future. Thanks for sharing the info about the sarcoma because it also says that even if I have all these surgeries I need to be vigilant and keep up with my checkups. Thank you! Any advice from anyone in the forum would be appreciated.",
