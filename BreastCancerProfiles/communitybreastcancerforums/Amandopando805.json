    "Content": "Amandopando805 wrote: I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, grade 3. 7 cm tumor in left breast, with positive cancer found in lymph nodes in neck by my clavicle and under my arm. I go for a pet scan tomorrow to see if it is any farther along, if it is I will be at stage 4. I have a bilateral mastectomy scheduled for the 19th for now unless I am stage 4. No history of breast cancer in my family. Lucky me. I saw a thread about essential oils and I can't find it now, if someone could point me in the right direction. Needless to say, I am pretty terrified. - Amanda Log in to post a reply",
