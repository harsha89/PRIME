      "Content": "May 29, 2015 11:27AM - edited May 29, 2015 11:33AM by Raebrewster1971 I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991 had lump taken out had 34 radiation treatments! After I was on last radiation treatment my surgeon called and said oh we made a mistake the pathologist called me and said you didn't have cancer after all! What I went threw and during the time I was getting radiation treatments my Dad passes away..my son was in Gulf war..I was going threw all this..Now after 24 years later I'm having problems with my liver in enlarging and my ribs are very sore and enlarging also can tell when I lay down the side is higher than the other..now I'm having problems with my ribs hurting in the back now..all because a dam doctor diagnosed me wrong and I'm glad I didn't have breast cancer because my mom did a cousin and aunt did..but now I'm suffering from the radiation treatments they gave me years ago that I didn't need in the first place..They over radiated me also because where I had the lymph nodes removed I was having puss coming out of incision that I had under my arm! All they can say is oh the radiation wont hurt you! right!",
