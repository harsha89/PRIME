Hoping all who have posted here are well into your recovery/healing process. It's been great catching up on what I've missed these past couple months. Looking back, October doesn't seem so long ago, so much has happened since then. Had my 1st mx Oct., 1996 with no reconstruction: my daughter wasn't yet 3 so didn't want to add any extra recovery time. Went thru chemo but no rads. Almost 16 years cancer free, diagnosed with a different bc Sept. 2012. Had 2nd mx with recon/TE's Halloween. Told hospital staff I didn't want to wake up to see angels or devils! No chemo or rads this time. Have been slowly getting fills and my exchange surgery is about 5 weeks away - 4/19. Glad I found this - better late......",

PS had me take naproxen sodium (NSAID) mainly at night to reduce swelling (I'd get Dr's approval) plus zip locks of ice chips over a t-shirt, when it starts to hurt, remove. That helped a bit for me. Hang in there, it does get better!  Edited to add: I didn't put a lot of ice chips in the bag as I wanted to keep it light weight on the swelling",

Do you have a specialty shop that sells mastectomy bras & prostheses? I found a beautiful swim suit a couple years back in Kohls and the owner of the lingerie specialty shop sewed in a pocket for my prosthesis. Such a deal for $10! Lifted my ego that I had a pretty suit off the rack that was both flattering and pretty.",
