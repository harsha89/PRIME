Do I have to put up with this every day of my life?? You guys all have great advice and I appreciate EVERYTHING you guys are telling me. I've learned a lot, butÂ I don't know whether to get a second opinion or demand that it be removed. The technician told me that itÂ could go away and I may get more.

I refuse to take my prognosis from the girl that took my mammogram!!! If I can't find a doctor around here, can I email you for your information on the doctor in Harrisburg?

They would never have tested her if it wasn't because of her mom. She only went in for her yearly mammogram.
