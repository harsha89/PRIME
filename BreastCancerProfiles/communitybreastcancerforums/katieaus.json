It is a 3 stage process for diagnosis - the only way of knowing is to get the cells out and tested by needle biopsy. Take a strong advocate with you to the next appointment. Is there a government funded breastscreening where you are? Im in Australia so we have a great health system. There is some research out now that indicates that breast pain is an early sign of cancer especially in women with dense breast tissue. The australian breast cancer groups and foundations are great and you can get on-line advice from them. If you think its not right demand a biopsy so you know for sure. Good Luck.",
