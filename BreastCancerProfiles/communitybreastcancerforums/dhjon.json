Three years ago when she told me she had found a lump in her breast I couldn't imagine that this could possibly be the outcome.  I thought they'd just remove it and we'd go on about our lives.  I guess we weren't the only ones with plans.  Over the last 3 years you ladies have been a huge support to Kari.  She found much comfort in knowing you, in sharing life with you.  You meant as much to her as she did to you. Ever the planner Kari planned everything.  In February we went to do pre-arrangements with her sisters.  I honestly don't know how I could have gotten through everything without that.  That's just one example of how Kari took care of me, prepared me for what was going to happen, and put me in a position to handle things.  She's still with me, in my heart, in my mind, in my memories.  And hopefully in who I am.  She made me want to be a better person, hopefully I've succeeded in being a little better because of her influence. Faith - not once did she ever lose faith.  I did, thankfully I manged to get it back, but she never did.  From the beginning we accepted God's plan and went with it.  Not that we didn't try to do all that was humanly possible too along the way.  Her rosary was standing room only in our Church.  The same Church we were married in, and baptised all of our babies in.  That speaks to what kind of woman she was.  She could pack a house.  Her funeral mass I'm told was the most beautiful one that anyone I have spoken to has ever attended.  Father Tom told me that Kari was helping him with the Homily.  I believe him, she was there. The kids are doing well.  We all miss Mom, but we all know that we'll see her again someday and know that she isn't sick any more.  Our miracle is that during the entire ordeal Kari never really suffered.  The pain medication worked, and for whatever reason the pain that should have been unsurmountable by looking at scans, just never materialized.  At least not that was shared with us. Anyway, enough rambling for me right now.  Again, I just wanted to let you know how much you meant to Kari, and me for that matter, as we fought the fight. In closing I'd like to share a couple of songs with you that Kari picked out.  Songs that she wanted played, and that really show who she was, and what she believed.  I know she picked them out for me, they make me feel much better.  They were played at the rosary. I'm not sure if I can post links or not but I'll try.  Believe - by Brooks and Dunn and I Believe - by Diamond Rio. Evidently I can't post links, but if you feel like it, you can find them on Youtube. I hope I haven't offended anyone by posting here.  That was not my intention.  Please, if this is offensive in any way, let me know and I'll come back and delete it. Thanks, Jon",
