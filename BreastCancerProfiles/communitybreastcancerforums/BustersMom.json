I had bilateral with SNB & immediate recon. BS said that my primary follow ups would be with the PS.  That made sense, since he \"finished\" the surgery. I was told to call PS when drains reached 15cc ( unless I had signs of infection). Monday I called & went in for drain removal.  The nurse took care of it for me, and didn't even look at the rest of me until I said \"can you please look at my other drain & incisions just to be sure it looks okay\"?  She did, and said I'm fine. I was told to call again when the other drain gets low.  And also to schedule a fill for next week. I dunno - this was major surgery, was it not ?  It seems so weird that nobody wants to see me yet. I am seeing BS in a week though.   Is this all normal ??   BMX 7/7/08 (R was prophy), SNB, immed recon. 1st exchange surgery 10/31/08; revision on 2/6/09; Tamoxifen 9/08. Local Recur DX 12/09.

I'm relatively young (42), BRCA negative, and have multifocal disease (IDC as well) in my left breast.   Since the disease is multi-focal, I am not a candidate for lumpetcomy.  So...  After much contemplation (over the past 5 weeks!) I have decided that I want a bi-lateral mastectomy.  I just decided this 2 days ago.   It's a touch choice to make - and has to be the right, personal decision for you. You'll need to get as much info as you can, and then give yourself a bit of time to make the right decision for you.  Your surgeon/doctor can explain the various options to you.    At first you just wont' know what to do - and then, you will be able to settle down a bit, look at the facts, think about your own peace of mind - and do what's right for YOU. For me, I just don't want to deal with finding another tumor on my right breast.  I found the tumor on my left (mammo missed it).  I dont' want to have MRI's on my right breast every 6 months.  I feel like my right breast is just a time-bomb.  Finally,  I want a symmetrical reconstruction.  Give yourself time to think about it.  I started a thread on the \"Surgery\" board - it's called \"uni-later vs. bi-lasteral - your story?\" and everyone's responses are different & very helpful. By the way, I found it funny that yo named your tumor \"Sid\".  I named mine \"Arnold\" just after I found it.   Take care, Hugs, Julie",
