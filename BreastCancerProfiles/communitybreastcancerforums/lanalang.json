      "Content": "Jun 16, 2012 05:44PM lanalang wrote: I had a duct excision last Tuesday. I had spontaneous bloody nipple discharge coming from my right breast. You most likely have what is called a singular intraductal papilloma. A papilloma is a benign mass that is found inside the duct. What they're going to want to do is remove the duct with the mass and biopsy it to check and see if a) it is a papilloma and b) given it is a papilloma does it present w/ or w/o atypia? If it is a papilloma without atypia-->you're good to go. no increased risk, totally normally. If it presents w/ atypia-->this is still technically benign, however, atypical cells are an increased risk for cancer. They are cells that are changing and may become cancerous. If this is found in your biopsy, your doctor will tell you where you need to go from there. However, even finding a papilloma with atypia is much less likely. There are a few other things this could be, but a singular intraductal papilloma without atypia is the most likely scenario. You're going to want to ask your surgeon how he is going to cut into the breast. Long cuts int the skin of the breast are more likely to leave scars. Cuts around the edge of the areola are less likely to leave scars. My surgeon only cut around the nipple since the mass in question for me was right under the nipple anyway. Discuss cutting options with your doctor. If appearance is important and you're concerned about scarring, tell him/her that and ask him about how he plans on cutting the breast. I'd also ask about stitches--all my stitches are internal and dissolvable. Having them internally probably will reduce your chance of scarring as well. Ask him if he uses any external stitching and discuss the options with him. You may want to ask if he uses local anesthesia with sedation or general. Local + sedation is easier on your stomach. I had that, it's great. You're asleep the whole time and wake up pretty easily. In terms of recovery one word here is key: COMPRESSION. The night I got home I went straight to sleep in my sports bra, but I didn't wrap it in an ace bandage. Boy, was that a big mistake. My breast swelled up with fluid b/c of the inflammation and is still having trouble draining. Ask your doctor if it's okay to wrap it with an ace bandage that first day you get home--if he says it's okay, i'd do it. It might decrease fluid build up. He might not want you to wrap it that much b/c the stitches will still be fresh, so please please please ask him first. Also, you're going to want to ice it on and off--30 min on and 30 min off... this is again to reduce swelling in the breast. In terms of pain I felt no pain the day I got home b/c the local anesthetic was still in my system. The next day I felt a burning pain b/c of all the nerves in there, that's normal, but it wasn't unbearable and I didn't take pain meds. It didn't really after that one day. Also, ask about lifting restrictions. I'm not supposed to lift anything over 5 lbs for the first week. The first night I lifted something not too heavy and my incision oozed. So be careful about that. If you have any more questions feel free to private message me. Good luck and I wish you the best!",

Is tennis your favorite sport?  I'm sorry that you're having emotional problems coping with the changes. I understand that that's really difficult because you were a certain way your whole life and now you look like something different. That's really hard to do deal with. Are you considering doing another reconstruction? Is there a possiblity that as it continues to heal that it will start looking better? I hope that you do get the results you're seeking!! Maybe you could talk to your doctor about a revision? SArah",

I don't know any store around here where I could find it, so I'd probably be better off ordering it in advance I think. Unfortunately, ordering online makes picking out my size a bit more difficult. I'm glad to hear that you're healing well! Is the Vit E oil just for scarring prevention or is it to nourish the entire area? Do you use vit E in combination with mederma? Is it very uncomfortable? I will be honest and say that I hate wearing a bra even, lol, it's the first thing I take off when I get home. I can imagine that a binder is worse! He said that he will try to go around the areola, but I don't know if he will also make a transverse incision to look at other areas in the breast... I'm hoping that he will stick to the radial incision around the areola. How are you coping post-surgery? Do you have any emotional concerns? For me it makes me feel so strange to know I won't be exactly as I am now and a biopsy makes me nervous. It makes me feel sad and concerned. How do you feel? I hope that everything is going well for you and that there is only good news in store for you. Thanks so much!  Sarah",

A duct excision is to take out the milk duct that the mass/blockage is sitting in, in order to a) stop the discharge coming out of my breast and b) to biopsy the mass. So I guess it's kind of a lumpectomy since there is a lump but I don't know if you can call it that if you don't know the pathology of it? I'm not sure if lumpectomy is a term used only if you know it's malignant or not... I'm not a real expert on the terminology  Do you know if all hospitals provide a breast binder to the patients? If that's what the surgeons think is best, I'd happily wear it. Three weeks is a long time, do you wear it day and night and only take it off to shower? Thanks for the brand name tips, and thank you for the well wishes! How are you doing? Are you doing well post surgery? I hope you aren't feeling too much discomfort. I hope the surgery went well for you and that you are getting better. PLease let me know if you want to talk about anything, I'd be happy to listen!  Thank you again for your kind advice. Sarah",

I agree with the other ladies: bring a sports bra with you. Also, try to ice the area after the surgery on and off, 30 min on, 30 off. In addition to that you might want to have an ace bandage to wrap around the sports bra. I got some really bad swelling opposite the site of the incision, because fluid accumulates from inflammation and might have trouble draining. More compression on the breast as provided by the bra + bandage together might help you limit swelling. The pain I felt was a sort of burning pain--they say the burning feeling is because of all the nerves in the area, so if you feel that it's probably normal. Good luck, ladies! I wish you the best and hope everything goes well.  Sarah",

They didn't tell me to wrap it until AFTER the swelling had gotten bad, which wasn't too much help to me at that point, which is why I wanted the ladies to know that tight compression like that beyond the sports bra will save you a lot of pain in the form of swelling later. I also found the compression wrap to be unbearable, I can barely tolerate wearing a bra day and night. Are you continuing to take something for the swelling like advil, or has your swelling pretty much been taken care of at this point?",
