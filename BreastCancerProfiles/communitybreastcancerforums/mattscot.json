(Note I am HER 2 + so Herceptin is thrown into the mix) I recently obtained my first opinion from MSKettering in Basking ridge NJ -- their protocol is AC T  (dose dense every 2 weeks)  plus Herceptin weekly. They recently performed an internal study in which they determined that when Herceptin combined with dose dense chemo reduces the risk of heart problems..   2nd opinion (NJ - local oncologist)-- pretty much the same ...my understanding is is that this is the standard on the east coast  -- this doctor noted in the west coast the trend now is TCH...   He is willing to offer TCH if I feel strongly. The other difference was after 2mos of AC (every 2 weeks 4x) -- He reccomends Taxol +Herceptin weekly (for 2 mos)  -- Which supposedly is very \"doable\" esp. after the AC-- Re the oncotype test my oncologist is interested in the results -- even though we know I will be doing chemo...  The test is supposedly reccomended for node neg, ER + to determine if chemo is necessary... and there is now a trend in the invasive lobular cancers that maybe hormone therapy is enough,... since I am HER 2 + that is all moot -- chemo indicated--    Anyway I am leaning towards the AC T --",

Looking at the test itself I believe it is highly driven by your ER/PR level and Her+ status that seems to have the biggest factor in the scoring..       ",

A has cardiac toxicity issues... it is still considered the gold standard. and is right in certain situations  .. but given your lower Oncoscore TC would make sense.  It is a little odd that your first doctor is telling you either no chemo or AC .  The second doctor sounds wonderful and is an excellent match for you.   The age factor does not seem to be factored into the oncotype test.... nor does the size of the tumor and that historically was a huge factor.  Nor does the type ..ILC versus IDC... What is kind of startling is to see cases of small tumors, low grades with HER- having a high score  ... this must  be connected to a lower ER/PR sensitivity.    ",
