I am so sorry that you are being treated that way.  I will say that if you want to quit you will when you are ready.  As for why we have TE's I can tell you that the reason I have mine is I had a Bi-lat on 2/24 with immediate expanders (also the day I quit smoking), I will have my exchange (they remove expanders and put implants in) approx. August after my rads are over. I stayed in the hospital over night and 40lbs won't happen for quite some time. Although some say no reconstruction after rads my PS said yes they can be done however they do like to expand you before hand but, it can be done after as well but will be at a much slower pace and maybe not as big.  Hair falling out due to chemo usually happens around day 13-18 (mine the 17th day) Could you maybe not lose it?? I suppose so but, not likely and yes it sucks to lose it but, IT DOES GROW BACK.  My last chemo was 1/26 and my hair started growing back during my last chemo TX's  How long you are out of commision after surgery depends on you for me not long, Pain I wouldn't say I was in Pain very uncomfortable for approx. 3 or 4 days then mildly uncomfortable for 3-5 then it gradually got better day by day or at least it did for me.  I hope I have helped in some small way as I remember wanting these same questions answered and some of these very same wonderful ladies helped me out and Lovinmomma made me laugh at a time I wanted to ball so Momma Thank You, I am currently doing rads 2 down 28 more to go and never thought I would make it past Chemo but, I did and partly because of your words of encouragement.

SUN SCREEN!!!! I am by no means attacking either side as I am a tanner myself and have been a manager of a tanning salon in the past and enjoyed it immensely but, I will tell you that if we as humans stopped participating in activities for fear of getting cancer then you would be surprised of just what you  couldn't, shouldn't or wouldn't do any longer like get X-rays, drink a glass of wine or eat certain foods, as well as what you could , should or would do to prevent cancer like eating certain foods you may not find very appetizing or activities that could cause you to fight off the ability of cancer cells from growing as well as if you lived a good clean life with no bad habits or having the perfect metabolism in order to ward off this awful beast however, I don't think it is possible to be perfect or do everything right therefore all we can do is the best we can and hope for the best but, mainly we just have to stay vigilant and become aware of the changes in our bodies. Yes I am a tanner always have been probably always will be however that being said I will just do it wisely as will all they others as I presume like me they do not want any type of cancer and every cancer has its own set nof issues one has to deal with. I truly hope I have not offended others however if I did it was done unintentional. Hugs, Debbi",

I asked about doing reconstruction while doing Rads and his answer was as long as they weren't radiating the breast he could continue with my fills which I mam being told they will radiate the clavicle area only for precautionary purposes, so I guess all is well or as well as can be, also I didnt have to have both breast taken but, chose to as not to have to relive this possibly in 2-5 years as I have seen happen to others I know.  Hope each and everyone is well and If there are any other questions I can ask my doctors let me know cause I go see my BS Monday and will gladly ask any you might have as luckily she is also my friend.

Going topless is wonderful and to be honest I thought I'd be more selfconcious than I am, matter of fact I forget about it, you know I think there is good in everything and every situation and the BC situation has made me realize life is way to fragile and precious to waste time worrying what someone will think or how someone will react to my hair do or lack thereof and that is a good thing that has come from my diagnosis.  Bad things come too however, I like to ignore the LOL. By The way Your daughter looked adorable in your wig.  My great nephew likes to put mine on (Worrisome???? Just a little LOL)when he comes over and the bad thing is he looks better in it than I, My granddaughter who is seven has never asked but, then again I think she tries ti give me normalcy.  Okay will stop going on and on just a little lonely tonight I guess and a little down.
