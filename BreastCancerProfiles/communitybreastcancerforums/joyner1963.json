I've had 4 tretments total and even though they gave me ALL the anti-nausea meds they could give me, nothing worked. I started researching on line and found  a transdermal patch called Sansuco. The medication in the patch is Granisetron, which is also used in IV for nausea.  Anyway, I put the thing on the morning of my chemo and I experienced NO nausea for the first time ever.   None during the week following and have had no queaziness either.  This patch was a life saver for me. The web site is www.sansuco.com.    It  has meant so much for me to be able to recover from treatment so quickly this time.    I hope the above info can help other women as well.
