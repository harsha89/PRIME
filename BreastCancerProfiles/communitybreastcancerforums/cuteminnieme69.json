Just a quicky note of this last year.  I was a cop for 7 years and because of a apprehension of burglary suspect that went horribly wrong,  I now have 6 herniated disk from my neck through to my lower back,  Two days after my birthday last year in June, my husband of 12 years told me he was in love with someone else ( we made it through this with counseling but it was very hard), I also had surgery to repair one disk, surgery for gallbladder, and upper and lower GI test.  I was unemployed for 8 months due to layoff, and so broke I don't know where the next meal is coming from.  Tornado went close to my house and did just enough damage to need repairs, but not enough to claim because deductable is too high.  Many things have happened financially this year to take us from having a home to we will be losing it soon.  I just about want to cry and never stop.  Then 1 1/2 weeks ago I was diagnosed w/cancer and all the above became \"not so bad\". My husband went to an appointment with me 2 days ago, and we were given results of four different test of the tumor they removed.  I'm the lucky winner of an \"aggressive cancer\" that is spreading at a fast rate, I have the hormone receptors that are \"feeding the cancer\", so I get to go through menopause at 39.  Because my mom has had ovarian cancer and grandma had cervical cancer and now i have breast cancer, I now have increased my chances for ovarian cancer from 8% to 85%, and if I have this gene, my girls will more than likely develop breast cancer.  I have had lumpectomy already and now gotta go have more removed along with my lympnoids to get the \"stage\"  As we were getting all this \"wonderful\" news and cracking jokes instead of just \"cracking\" my hubby leans over and with a pen writes on my leg \"you gotta laugh\".  This has stuck with me.  I want to cry, but what good does that do.  I am ready to tackle this like all the other challenges in my life with full force.  I have the best support in the world \"God\". In Him all things are possible.  I have a loving family, but I feel like \"a problem\" to them, not that they think that, I just do.  I am so independant it is hard to lean on others.  I am the one who is usually there for everybody else, but if truth be known \"i am scared!!!!!\" Thanks for listening and keep on smiling Mary Dx 8/13/2008, IDC, 1cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
