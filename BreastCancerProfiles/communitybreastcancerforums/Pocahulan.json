I was diagnosed at 33 w stage II, recurrence 3 years later, recurrence again 3 more years later, then confirmed BRCA 2 gene, removed ovaries, now chronic breast cancer stage IV metastasis into bones and liver, and I've had the boatload of drugs/chemo/radiation which ALL are too familiar. My tumor markers would increase 50% each time I drew blood from 01-2014 thru 06-2015 yet my scans showed nothing. Finally, we did an early scan and my cancer was everywhere with new growth. It was shocking, but my oncologist has many options to continue trying. I just started Afinitor/Aromasin combo 2 days ago and have no idea where I'm going from here. Our liver is a large organ. Ask your Doc if it can be removed, transplanted, every option, every door. Leave no sunner unturned. Although, I have not gotten to point of more chemo, my doc felt that was a viable option, if needed. Go to another oncologist if necessary. If you get to City of Hope in LA or any hospital you're located near that goes outside of the box, try to get that second opinion. Hang in there Sonyarizzo. Your spirit is more powerful than this cancer. There is a point of living, no matter how long or short. Be strong. We will cheer you on.",
