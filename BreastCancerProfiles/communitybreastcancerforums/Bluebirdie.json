I just started chemo on July 2nd. I had my port installed on the 1st, but for the first infusion they used an IV line. I can't wait until the incision settles and heals up. It's still a little sore. I'm getting 6 rounds of taxotere every three weeks (plus herceptin and perjeta indefinitely). So far the nausea has been well controlled, but the dry mouth/sore throat/taste changes have been pretty severe. Also just general achey-ness and fatigue. Luckily, I'm on medical leave so I can sleep and rest as much as possible. I chopped my waist length hair into a pixie and will probably buzz cut it before it falls out. I'll look into getting a wig soon, but I plan on using scarves more (I've picked up a bunch and they seem more comfortable to wear than a wig). Anyhow, I just wanted to say hi and follow this thread. --birdie",

I was trying to decide if I wanted to continue with fertility preservation after my diagnosis moved to stage IV and i was told I would be on herceptin ans perjeta indefinitely and unable to use the eggs myself (I opted not to continue and start treatment right away and focus on getting myself better). But the 5 year survival rates I saw were based on data from years ago and there have been advances in treatment since then. One of my professors has an aunt who was diagnosed with stage IV BC at age 27 and she's still fighting cancer off at 71! She had a recurrance but beat it. Another professor who recently was treated for BC herself and did a ton of research said the drugs doctors have access to now are rewriting many of the stats. I'm trying to keep all that in mind, but am also trying to stay realistic. I might not be a super survivor, but maybe I will be! And I'm gonna do everything in my power to make it possible. I know how overwhelming this all is. Sometimes I have really sad days, too and it's hard to stay positive. Like Rambo50 said, we will beat it, too! (((((Hugs))))",

I'm now 10 days out after my first chemo.  The sore, inflamed mouth has been one of the worst SE I've encountered so far.  I have just started using the baking soda/salt/water rinse and it does seem to provide some relief.  Not sure what else I can do to prevent this from happening next time.  The worst days were probably 3-6.  Just no energy at all.  I've still tried to do a few little things here and there, like walking every night, had a meal out with my boyfriend and nephew on Saturday, made two trips to Target (not driving myself yet, though).  Either I was pushing myself a little too hard or my body is just not as strong as I'd like it to be, but I had to sepend a few hours in the ER on Wednesday evening.  I spiked a temperature (100.4), took 2 tylenol and called the advice nurse.  She said I would have to go the ER for blood work and to be checked out.  They couldn't locate any particular cause of the temperature spike (like, no UTI or ear infection).  They put me on two IV antibiotics and gave me an additonal 10 suppy just to be sure.  When I talked to my own oncologist yesterday she said I have pretty severe neutopenia (low count of the neutrophil type of WBC).  She said to be really careful to avoid infection, rest, stay hydrated for now.  She said that starting on my second cycle they will add the neulasta injections to help prevent this from happening again.  I'd had a headache since then, but it finally seems to be subsiding! I ordered the Brian Joseph's brow gel after seeing it on this thread. I really hope it works.  I know that I've already had one chemo so I'm not starting when I should, but it can still help somewhat, I'm game.  It should arrive today.  I haven't noticed any thinning of my hair yet, but I have really thick hair.  I'm mostly \"okay\" with the fact that my hair will fall out, but if I can try to keep my lashes and brows I think I'll feel a little better (not as scary looking, I guess).  We'll see how it goes.  I hope that everyone is recovering from any of the SEs you may be experiencing.  My port seems to be healing up well, not really as sore anymore, so hang in there ladies with recent ports! I haven't had mine accessed, yet, but I will ask for the cream to help numb the area before my next infusion.  I'm thinking of you all and sending good feeling vibes your way! --bluebirdie",
