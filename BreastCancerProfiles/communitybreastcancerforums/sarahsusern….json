I don't have breast cancer but my mom was diagnosed a few years ago with mets to her bones (her first diagnosis was 20+ years ago). Since then, they have found spots on her liver and more recently, the areas on her bones and liver have shown growth so they have switched her from hormonal treatment to chemo. It is definitely a heartbreaking ordeal and it is hard seeing someone we love and look up to go through it. I spent some good days crying when I found out the cancer progressed, just because I tend to think of the worst. Thank goodness for this community who help me keep realistic but hopeful outlooks in mind. Never give up hope! It's not over til it's over. There are those who live many years with stage IV, and who's to say that your mom won't be one of them. Just continue to encourage her, I know it will mean so much. Sarah",

Family history is serious matter and it sounds like you did an incredibly thorough job and spent a good deal of time thinking over your decisions which is great. Oftentime, especially in a lot of cases dealing with bc, knowledge is power and I know it was not an easy decision but I commend how you've been so proactive. I definitely want to be the same way. I am a bit anxious/excited to meet with this genetic counselor. She is only in a few times a week and there was a bit of delay getting the proper paperwork to her but I am looking forward to getting some real answers (my guesses have run wild) about my true risk. My mom has is in the middle of getting a referral for genetic testing (as i've mentioned, she has texted negative for both BRCA's in the past) and that will give me us more answers, although it would even be great to meet with a counselor for some peace of mind and insight to prepare myself for either kinds of test results. Thanks again for chiming in. All the best and well wishes & a smooth road to recovery!",

It is so unfortunate that bc can be so sneaky and that even with proven or not-proven mutations, it really has know true rhyme or reason. Even with my mom being diagnosed at 37, her first recurrence came ten years later at 47, she was cleared, and then it came back again at 55, first in the bone, now in the liver & surrounding the lungs. Breast cancer wouldn't leave her alone. She recently started the red devil and we're hoping this is the one to kick cancer's butt. Now it's a matter of getting her tested again, hopefully her insurance can cover a larger spectrum of genes as she has only been tested for the BRCA ones and that was decades ago.",

Such a sneaky beast. Her symptoms after taking adriamycin have been tough for sure. After the first week the nausea and pain haven't been bad at all. The thing that's been the worst for her is the shortness of breath and coughing, but that's due to the cancer (pleural effusion) so it's a matter of finding a chemo to help with that. After having successes with hormonal therapy for three years ('11-'14), they stopped working and cancer spread last summer and since then she has been on Gemzar, Taxol & Tacotere -- all of which did not help at all. We are praying hard and holding onto hope that Adriamycin is the one to shrink some of these tumors and dry up this effusion so she can finally breathe easy and actually have an uninterrupted night of sleep (it has literally been months since that's happened).

Due to the effusion, she hasn't been able to have a petscan since January so a lot of the changes in treatment are gauged by her pain, some nodes near her neck (getting larger or same size, etc) and the fluid reaccumulation in her lungs. It is frustrating (to say the least) that we are unable to have any scans to see what is going on inside her body and to decipher if her symptoms are cancer related or treatment related -- to figure out really if she has gotten better or worse. What's interesting though is with the influx of some pain subsiding and some pain getting stronger in certain areas -- the pain in her liver is gone. There was a time a couple of months ago where it crazy painful for her. Is this a good sign? The bloodwork for liver function has come back good. But since we don't have the scans, I just don't know.. Thanks so much for any and all advice! xo, Sarah",

Thank you so much for your kind words and insight from your experience. I am so glad to hear that your mom is cancer free today, but am so sorry for yours and your sister's recent diagnosis. Cancer is synonymous to \"the end is near\" to the outside world, but as we know, this doesn't have to be the case and I am glad that there are strides to better the treatment and chances for those involved. Sending prayers and well wishes to your family. I totally understand your younger sister's concern. Wow, we really do have a lot in common in that there seems to be a lot of girls in our family and the young diagnosis. I can't imagine what a whirlwind of emotion it must have been for you and your family (with a new nephew too, congrats!) this past year. And speaking of girls, my mom is one of four girls, I have five girl cousins, I have three daughters. I don't know how much all of that downplays in risk and genetics, but I do know that the fact that my mom and my cousin were both 37 during their initial diagnosis, doesn't seem to be good sign.. My gut leans to the fact that there is something in our genes, but to be honest, I tend to be an anxious/glass half full when it comes to chances so either way, it will be good if my mom can get tested with the wider spectrum soon. But like you said, even if she is negative, there are still mutations that have yet to be discovered. It's all such a weary experience. I'm sure that meeting with a genetic counselor to discuss our family's history in detail will provide better information and how I can be proactive now and in the future.",

She has been on Gemzar, no luck with that; then Taxotere, no luck there either & now on Taxol, although from the looks of things, it doesn't seem to be working. Needless to say, it is all pretty discouraging. We are in the process of getting a second opinion for her at a prestigious cancer center in our city that also participates in clinical trial. The hit or miss of finding an effective treatment (hopefully there is one!) is frustrating.
