      "Content": "SharonJ1234 wrote: Hi There, Last year I was diagnosed with Stage IV Breast Cancer which was in my adrenal gland. I had abraxan, and Radiotherapy. Previously I was nearly 9 years cancer free). Tumour was also in my arm. On 10/10/16 I got the all clear. Just back from my oncologist today. He has the results of my CT scan. It was basically clear, except for a probable upper renal pole mass on my left kidney or left adrenal gland. Now have to go and have a renal ultrasound. Oncologist didn't seem too concerned as he compared it to previous CT 6 months prior and said it was very hard to see. My question is. Has anyone also had it come back in kidney or adrenal and if so what was your course of treatment? Thanks so much.
