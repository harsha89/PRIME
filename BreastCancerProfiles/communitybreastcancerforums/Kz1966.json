I don't have a lot of control over it. What I do know is that yes it sucks but I also know after a few days I will feel better!

Yesterday was one week after my first treatment and had to go have my blood checked. White blood cell count was very low so Dr. said I cannot return to work. I need to go home and stay away from people. Need to avoid germs. I'm a manager at a call center so of course I'm around tons of people and sick people. He said it usually goes back up on its own. Did a little research on foods to eat to help bring it up. Next Wednesday is treatment day, so they'll check my blood again to see if I can have treatment. Just reading through these posts. I get aggravated at some of the comments made to me. I think people mean well and just don't know what to say. So many people think they know what they are talking about but have no idea. I didn't know lots about cancer until I was diagnosed. People will say you may not lose your hair not everyone does. Based on the treatment I'm getting, yes I will lose my hair. I was told that A/C on a scale of 1 to 10 is an 8 strength wise. I always thought chemo was chemo, I didn't know that there are different treatments based on type of cancer etc. Yesterday when I was waiting for my blood test results, a lady randomly says, so what kinda cancer ya got? I said excuse me? I knew I heard her but who does that?? She goes on to tell me she has liver and some other kind. In the office where I go, you are just in a room with a bunch of other people getting your blood drawn. I really hate that. I don't want to see everyone else getting poked at, let alone people looking at me. I think as I get used to the routine, I won't care but some of the things they talk about, I just don't want to hear it! I forgot to put the numbing cream on my port but guess what? I didn't hurt :) I was given information for groups to attend, but I really love these boards. I'm comfortable here. People check up on others. I'm comfortable saying how I feel. When no one gets what I'm talking about I can come here, because you do. Wishing everyone a great day!! Kathie   ",

Dr. did say the fatigue will hit harder on the next one. I'm taking my claritan to help with Nulesta and so far so good. My BRCA results are in so have an appointment next Tuesday. They had an opening today to go over them but I thought I'd be wiped out today so didn't set that one up. Why they don't just tell me over the phone, is beyond me. I may be thinking the wrong way, but it's just another bill to pay!!. Makes me think it's positive, otherwise why not say it's negative over the phone. I overthink a lot. Sometimes my overthinking has proved me right. I found the lump, and just knew and here I am. Hope everyone has a great day! One day at a time!",

I did the ice chips so hopefully no sores. The only thing I used from my bag was my drink lol. I could tell I was the newbie, no one else brought a bag lol. I sat near a window that had a bird feeder so I had a nice view. My MO said I'll probably feel some SE starting tomorrow night. Mainly fatigue. Came home and took a nap. 1 down 3 to go of A/C.  Thanks for everyone's support!",

My husband was telling me and although I didn't say anything, other than how sad that is, I sure don't want to hear that!! My personal opinion is, it's insensitive. Is it supposed to make me feel lucky? Like I only have BC? It's just like people saying, you'll be fine, stay positive, be strong. I know all that thanks! Hearing it from people here is different than someone who has no clue. We are each other's strength some days. I personally don't feel you're being insensitive at all.  As for the laundry - I'm still waiting for the fun part too. ",

I'm sorry that they scared the crap out of you. I think I've posted this before but I'm going to say it again, a lot of side effects are manageable. You feel sick, they have a pill for that. You feel constipated, there is something for that. You feel tired, sleep. The worst part for me was the achy feeling from the Neulesta shot. For me, it wasn't like I want to cry pain. It was in my neck and back so laying down was tough. Once I was laying down I didn't feel it again until I would turn over. This time I'm going to start my claritan 4 days before treatment, so tomorrow. My white blood cell count is very low so I'm not working until after my next appt. on Wed. I had no problems eating at all. I did the ice chips. I'm going in to my next treatment thinking- okay, it may not be same, Could be easier or could be harder. I'll deal with it either way. I know this is tough but you will be tougher! ",

Just another little hump to get over. No big labor day bbq. Just me and my hubby. Weather here on Ohio has been fantastic so definitely enjoying that.

Only took one pill for nausea. The soreness from neulesta started to feel better last night and woke up this morning much better. I took Aleve pm to help with sleep and only woke up once. Did wake up with a headache but I can deal with that. Hoping today I can get up and move around a bit more. Get my blood checked on Thursday and hoping white cell count is good so I can go to work. Hate being stuck in the house. I can honestly say that having my head shaved isn't bothering me at all. That was the one thing I regretted the most but now that it's done, it's just not that important to me. Wishing everyone a fantastic day! Hugs to all!",

I finished my dose dense A/C treatments and had my 3rd taxol treatment yesterday. So far I can say that the weekly taxol has been so much easier than A/C. My 3rd A/C was the toughest fatigue wise. I wasn't able to work during A/C as my white blood cell count was too low. Had a blood transfusion a few weeks ago due to red blood count too low. Both red and white are still on the low side but okay to go back to work. I went back to work last week. I have taxol weekly and carboplatin and taxol every 4th treatment. As far as side effects. Dry mouth, eyes seem to be dry (using drops), tired but not fatigue, Taste buds seem to be back to normal. Reading on the taxol board, some have side effects that seem to hit later on. So who knows down the road so I'll enjoy feeling decent for now. I have wig but don't wear it. It felt hot and itchy and kept feeling like I had to check to make sure it looked okay. I don't mind the scarves. Eyelashes and eyebrows are still there. Keeping waiting for those to go. I know we've had lots of ups and downs but hang in their ladies, we've got this! I just go one day at time. Hugs to all.  Kathie",
