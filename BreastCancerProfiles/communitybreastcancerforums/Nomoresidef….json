I had horrible swelling in my arm pit. Heart racing and it's been over a year since that procedure. Now I've had several surgery s since then. 3 lumpectomy and then a dble mastectomy node removal on my other side. Interesting enough is I have hardly any pain or issues w the other side... At all . I had 2 different surgeons so..I feel like there is a hook in my armpit and have constant pain at incision site. Doing otherwise helps.. do does not having a manual labor job..which I do.. I'm figuring it out. Good day",
