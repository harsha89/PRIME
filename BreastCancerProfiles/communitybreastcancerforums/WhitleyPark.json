Based on the US/MA, I was diagnosed with a lipoma in my left breast. Birads-2. Because of this B9 result, I declined the visit to the breast surgeon that was covered / the next step. I tend toward the side of - why use vital resources for a something that's nothing. I was told a lipoma is basically no big deal and based on research - this sounds legit. I tend to not worry about something that isn't a thing - so I let it go. Fast forward 4 weeks or so. My left breast still hurts like a mo-fo. Not all the time - but frequently - as it did before the US/MM. Now, today, getting out of the shower, I noticed my nipple is kinda caved in and different than the right nipple. This is new. VERY visibly new. My left breast also has seemed like it's been getting a little smaller lately. I felt this was slightly the case before my MM/US - but I feel like lefty is continuing to deflate. Should I take the appointment with the breast surgeon? I hate to be a hypochondriac and waste resources for those with real issues. I'm a VERY healthy person in all my 49 years. Basal Cell Carcinoma only (which, as we know, doesn't count as a real \"cancer\"). My dad had colon cancer - but he didnt get regular colonoscopies so it most likely could have been avoided if he'd been diligent (not sure if that really matters if you have a \"cancer gene\" - which I don't know if I do...) Anyhoo - I have no idea if I should do anything or not. Again - don't want to be \"that patient\". Not sure who - if anyone - to contact next. Any and all thoughts welcome! TIA EDIT: I just re-read the results from the US/MM and it all feels so definitive as nothing. I think I'll wait a few weeks and see what the breast/nipple does. Just not sure how I'm able to second guess the professional results at this time... Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jun 14, 2018 05:24PM - edited Jun 14, 2018 05:24PM by WhitleyPark Prayers for you, Daring, that your dx is B9. I have my mammo & UA tomorrow and I'd love to know the same. Also - I'm wondering what the general experience is with the mammo/UA - it sounds like most (?) end up having a biopsy but at the UA they give a BI-RAD grade that gives an indication of what they think it might be. Is this correct-ish? Do they ever send you home from the mammo/UA with a hearty pat on the back and a, \"All good. See you in a year\"? I haven't told my DH about all this yet. I'm banking on the 80% change it's B9 and the fact he's in a very stressful time at work - this week in particular. I planned to tell him tomorrow night (Friday) and I'm wondering what level of info I could expect to have for him (roughly speaking). Trying to balance freaking him out (he'll freak more than me, for sure) and keeping important health information from my spouse. Thank you all for this wonderful community!",
