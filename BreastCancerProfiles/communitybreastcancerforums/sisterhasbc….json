She also does not go on these boards as she read sometimes it is better not to do so, so I go on and pick up what advice I can. She was absolutely terrified about having chemo but on the whole tolerated AC pretty well and while it was not easy I do not think it was nearly as dreadful as she imagined and I can remember how relieved both she and I were after her first treatment. She would feel \"ick\" starting a couple of days after and would start to feel better in the days preceding her next treatment but never actually threw up. She did get the fatigue as well but she was able to still go out and do things, particularly in the week preceding her next treatment. They did an echocardiogram before treatment began and one after and there were no changes. She did say she experienced chemo brain but I don't think it was that pronounced and outwardly she did not seem mentally diminished to me. Her blood counts remained pretty stable. Her taste was off and it affected her appetite to some extent but not to the point where she couldn't eat (she actually got strange cravings at times--after the first treatment she kept wanting ham sandwiches). She also had some difficulty swallowing, but again it would pass by the time her next treatment was due. In reading these discussions the common thread I see among those who have had AC is that it is not fun but it is doable. Perhaps if you or your mom can talk to some people who have gone through AC it would help. Best wishes to you and your mom.",

My sister was having significant shortness of breath (even just walking short distances)and initially attributed it to being rundown from treatment and lack of exercise but turned out she had a RARE reaction to either taxol or herceptin which caused inflammation in her lungs, which has gotten much much better a few weeks after both have stopped. She had completed her taxol but her oncologist will be starting her on herceptin again shortly. Again, this is a rare reaction but don't be hesitant about mentioning your shortness of breath to your dr",

Tylenol has been sufficient for pain. Tip about buying button down shirts were helpful and the reason they need to be oversized is to have room for the drains underneath. If you have a belt from a terry cloth robe that is useful to put over you neck and pin the drains to while in the shower or instead of pinning them to your shirt. Also using a long piece of ribbon for the same purpose. No blood transfusions. She is in the recliner during the day, sleeping in a bed but not great. She is able to do her drains herself, has needed some help pinning and unpinning them to change and shower but overall is pretty self sufficient. My sympathy on the taxol, it was not her friend either but she is finally feeling better. Best wishes on your surgery and recovery",

Very relieved that one infusion is done, hoping that any side effects which develop are not too bad. Posting this message to let people know that infusion process was not as scary as we were imagining.

She also had cancer in one lymph node on the side with the tumor. As a result she has undergone chemo and will be having a double mastectomy this month. That being said, had she not had these unexpected issues she would have been happy with the choice as she likes her new breasts and the surgery itself went smoothly.",
