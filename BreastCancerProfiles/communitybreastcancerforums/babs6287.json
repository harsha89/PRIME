My PS wants to go low and slow on the fills since my left side had so much radiation. It will be 50 cc each time. (The PS did a full fill on the right side at the time of the TE) I worked all through chemo-never missed a day! I never wore a mask at work but kept using the hand sanitizer. I chose not to go in close quarters with lots of strangers-so I avoided movie theaters and shows. We did go out for dinners with friends-my thinking was that I was only close to those we went with plus we needed some normalcy during this crazy time. I ate lots of protein, drank tons of water to flush the chemicals out of my body and didn't eat fruit-too hard to clean strawberries and raspberries and I stayed away from sushi and dairy products. I used biotin mouthwash just in case and never had any mouth issues so I guess that worked. I actually found the radiation harder than chemo-it was very tiring for me. It could have been because it was just 3 weeks after chemo ended. Plus, I did radiation daily at 700 AM (in the cold of Jan-March) so I wouldn't be late for work(That meant I woke up and left an hour earlier than normal). The radiation itself just took minutes and you feel nothing. In between the chemo and radiation I took a trip to visit my parents in Florida and wore a mask on the flights to and from. Wrenn-hoping you are getting better and stronger every day Jdayton-how as the radiation treatment today. Use lots of aqua for in the AM and night to help prevent burning. To all-have a good night !

I was told to start chemo before my mastectomy but decided I needed to have the cancer out first and then let chemo work on anything that might be \"left.\" I've never looked back or thought what if. Maybe you should look into fat grafting to fix the deficits from the lumpectomy so you'll feel better about how you look. Poodlemum-sorry you're feeling stagnant Lisa-You're so right about the heartburn-it can be scary the first time! Tomorrow is my second fill.

I saw both my BS and PS today and they both were thrilled that my FG held so well.  We now have a plan.  Another FG in about a month.  If that doesn't give me enough of a foob, then 3-4 months after that he'll do a very small implant on my left side.  If I get another infection then I'm done and will accept being a uni-boober.

Kbee- glad your first chemo went well Lisa I too chewed on ice during the treatments.  I never developed any mouth sores.  I was also told to and did rinse my mouth with Biotene mouth wash.  Foods that I usually loved, tasted like metal.  I never iced my hands or feet.  I found myself cold a lot and couldn't bear being colder than I had to be.  My MO gave me all different meds-to take for nausea, anxiety, etc.  I really don't remember all the names.  All I can say is that I only took the anti-nausea medication once.  I did take Prilosec throughout the whole process based upon our closest friend who's a gastroentorologist's recommendation .  The most important thing I can tell you is to drink as much water as possible-especially while taking adriomycin.  You also should have your husband use a different bathroom for the first 24 hours after your treatment.  The AC is very toxic and you don;t want him  to have any contact with it.  Also, eat protein and green leafy cooked vegetables.  I didn't eat any sushi or fresh friut (my favorite thing to eat)  I stayed away from dairy foods.  Since this worked for me and I really did NOT have a hard time with the chemo these  are my suggestions for you. I had really bad SE's after my first Neulatsa shot so after that  I took claritin before and after all of my other neulasta shots which worked like a charm, I'll probably be very busy the next few days so PM me any other questions you have! Everyone be well!!!!!!! Babs ",

I have been very lucky thus far- my surgeries, my chemo and my radiation all went well and I've had very few issues. But, I live everyday knowing that I had Stage IIIC bc with lots of lymph node involvement. I need to be on this thread to be with those who are in the same battle that I am because no one else knows what we go through. If I can help those that are having issues that is a major bonus.

He knows me well and understands how anxious/crazy I can get. So, he went down to the lab and made them read my pet scan. The preliminary reading shows nothing to worry about.

Since the right was a skin sparing MX I am not feeling as much pressure.    I haven't looked at the recon from the front yet-will do that when I shower.  What were you told about care? Such as dressings?  Once again, I wasn't told anything.  When they put the TE's in they filled my right to 300 cc (which might end up being my final size-the PS said I should look at it and try on some tank tops to see if that's the size I want to be or a little bigger) and 200 on the right.  I think I remember the PS saying they start fills after all the drains are out.  I've been told fills are uncomfortable but manageable.  My PS leaves the TE's in for 4 mos after the last fill.

My daughter ( who is single) worked at a job that entailed lots of travel to Europe.  Once I got my chemo schedule she advised her company that she had to be in the US and in NY every other weekend for me.  Unfortunately she moved to Europe this past June so could not be here for my most recent surgery but she did come home this past Wed to be here for me.   She is one of my blessings-her, my husband, my sister, my parents and so many great friends! I also have a son who is married, has 2 sweet little girls, 2 1/2 and 6 mos old, and lives 5 min away.  We don't have the best relationship since he got married and throughout this year he has been more MIA than anything else.  He even called and asked me not to \"spit or lick\" his children while I was undergoing chemo since that would be dangerous for them!  Like I ever did that before my illness!  It's amazing to me to raise 2 children and for them to be so different.  Throughout this past year his wife has never asked me once how I'm doing nor has she called me.  I guess that's because I'm the horrible \"mother-in-law\"  I just don't get it.  As a human being how could you be so cold?  Whatever!!! As I said I have my wonderful blessings so I have never let my son and his wife bring me down.  I am getting stronger every day and can't wait to be finished with this journey and to have beaten Ca ! All of us need to find the positives in our life and to enjoy the life we have!  We, better than most, know how fragile life can be.  Remember we are all here for each other!!!! Babs",

No chemo, no radiation no surgeries just management-scary!!!! Went to MSKCC this week and what a world of difference. First of all, the MO was happy that my Ca took 2 1/2 years to come back, happy that the ca lymph nodes are very small and thrilled that I was the perfect candidate for the Ibrance/Femara combo (my MO thought I was NOT a candidate!) I am also going into a study called the Impact Assay study where they single out over 400 genomes so they can target therapies specifically for me Plus, if need be, she did not rule out chemo in the future. She is going to biopsy my rt axilla lymph node to make sure my recurrence is regional and not widespread. I walked out of there 100 lbs lighter. Even my daughter said that I sound like myself again! I am so very happy I went to Sloane. ( I did go to them the last time but they said the same exact thing as my MO so the Dr at Sloane said I should stay with my MO since she was closer to home and it would be easier on my body. I am still nervous but much more optimistic that I will beat the shit out of this damned cancer. Babs ",

Rest after each treatment so you can keep your strength up.  Remember to find whatever works best for you! Lili- thanks for your words of encouragement about my son.  My expectation level is 0 and anything more I see as a plus.  I didn't let him bring me down this year.  I had great support from so many.  He will feel guilty one day-as he should. KBee- I thought my son would have come around when I was first diagnosed but that didn't happen.  I think he is so self-absorbed and has soooo much on his plate because he married a woman who can't deal with anything-his choice of course.  He needed to feel \"large and in charge\" and she gives him that.  However, she pulls all of his strings.  Again, his choice.  When I started radiation he called to ask me how my radiation would effect his daughter and would it be better for me not to see her during this period. I know he knows better but had to answer to somebody else. But------ It is my New Year today so I wish everyone only good results from any and all tests and a very HEALTHY New Year.  Remember, when you are down just come to this web site for the support we all need and deserve!",

My daughter made sure she was here for it as did my niece who lives in San Francisco.

I think I'm probably an A now -was going for a B but oh well! Yes, my daughter returned home 2 weeks ago-actually she will now be based here and in Milan. After my fill yesterday we spent the day-lunch and shopping. Although I was very uncomfortable, it was a great day. My daughter is just the best person to be with-she lifts me up like no other person can. KBDayton- Looks like you're doing your treatments in the same order that I did. I waited a year from my BC dx and UMX to do the reconstruction. I think it gives one more time to breath and to make a more informed decision. If I had done a BMX and immediate recon in the beginning when my world had just been turned upside down and I had to do something quickly, I might have done things differently. Do all your research, meet with lots of PS's and you'll then be able to pick wisely. Let me know if you have any questions along the way!!! Vintage Gal I would have jumped right to the Blood Builde-liver makes me gag!!! Always has!!!!! Ndgrrl See, even a bad experience has an upside-it makes all of us laugh!

My mother died at the age of 42 from BC so I've always been diligent about by Bcare.  I had a few benign lumps on my left side about 14-16 years ago.  My sister is a 14 year Ovarian survivor-thankfully!!!! In July 2012 I felt pain in my left breast.  But, because I was always told that BC doesn't hurt, I didn't do anything.  Then, I popped a lymph node in my neck on the same side.  I work for derms so I asked one to look at it.  He told me to go to my GP in 2 weeks if it didn't go away.  When it didn't, and I still had pain in my left breast with what I thought was swelling due to a bruise (I tend to walk into things all the time and bruise)  I decided to go for a mammogram before seeing my BS-thinking the mammo would be clear and my BS would tell me not to walk into walls anymore!  Well, you can just imagine my shock when the radiologist called me into his office and told me I had BC-even before taking a biopsy!  He immediately called my BS and right after my core biopsy I went to see my BS who told me the tumor was over 4 cm by over 4 cm and they were sure the ca had spread to my lymph nodes.  He was as shocked as I was.  He had just examined me in April and my GP had examined me mid May-how could this happen????  I was so diligent -I had taken evista for a few years, nursed my children, ate healthy, exercised, didn't drink or smoke and had a prophylactic hysterectomy 14 years prior to avoid this diagnosis, but here I was!   My way to deal was to just march forward, determined to TRY to live my life normally and to conquer this thing.  One week after the mammo, many tests later, and with a confirmed biopsy report I had a UMX.   I wanted to do a BMX but the drs felt the key for me was to have chemo quickly so they only wanted me to do the one side.  My Sx (full mastectomy with full lymph node dissection) was on a Friday and crazy me was back at work the Tues right after.  I find work my saving grace.  It gives me something to focus on.  Exactly 3 weeks after my sx, I began dose dense AC followed by T.  That was followed by 26 radiation treatments and then 6 boosts.  I never missed a day of work.  My boss thinks I'm amazing!!  My family thinks I'm nuts and push myself too much.  When I lost my hair, I rocked scaves wrapped around my head to look like stylish turbans-or so I thought!  I finished  all treatments in March 2013.   Since then, my focus has been on a PMX on my right done with bilateral TE's.  After meeting with many Drs I found a team that I feel good about.  My sx is August 29th and, for the first time in this crazy process, I am getting nervous,  I have been so busy going forward that I really haven't stopped to think of all that has happenend until now.  So reading the positives with my type of diagnosis has been a godsend.  Thank you all!!!!!  We all need to hear the success stories!!!

It's supposed to be done when you've been taking the pills for 2 weeks but since I already had a trip to Israel planned for this coming Tuesday they made the decision to move it up so I could be a part of the study and still take my trip. Will update as I have more to share! Babs",

I find that so many of us don't speak up because we're \"captive audiences\". I think it's up to us to make them accountable or this will keep happening Bab ",

Remember that! Z as I always say you amaze me. Your knowledge is astounding and your positivity is catchy. Since we haveno where to be this Thanksgiving ( My bf who made Thanksgiving every yr moved to Fla) we decided to fly over to Paris to surprise our DD for her 40 th.

For some reason I do better on chemo than rads. Weird! Wishing all a good weekend Babs",

They were actually easy for me-thank god! For the first time since I was dx with MBC, I am really having issues. Throughout everything I've been very lucky-no symptoms until the numbness in my rt ankle, back of my rt thigh, and rt buttock. Yesterday I finished rads (10) which I found very hard-exhausting plus now I have really bad pain in my rt lower back, hip and rt shoulder area. I've taken my first pain pill since my radical mastectomy. This is hard!! I am also bloated-probably due to constipation. I am getting some stomach cramps-again I'm assuming from the constipation. This week I had blood tests and my liver numbers are up. ALT went from 33 to 49 and AST went from 27 to 36 Due to rads I've been off all other treatment but before I went off them, my CEA and CA15-3 shot up. I'm getting scans on Tuesday and leaving for my DD bday in Paris the next day. I go back on the GDC 0077 this Monday. I already spoke with my MO in case the scans are not good and if that be the case then I go back on Halaven. Not happy about that but what bothers me most is how I'm feeling. What are some symptoms other have had from the liver mets? Babs",

I'd have to be off all meds for 2 weeks which isn't bad. The SE's are foggy brain with memory issues and also sight issues. Thus far almost everyone in this study has experienced these SE's. I would have to be at MSKCC for about 1/2 day every other week. Decided this wasn't for me. I work and love to work and need to have my full marbles while there. I can't see the time commitment for a drug with these SE's. My MO agreed that if possible I should have another biopsy so they can get enough of a sample to do the Impact testing. She is looking into this and also immunotherapy for me. In the meantime, since it takes so long to get those test results back, I DO NOT want to be w/o a therapy so she suggested CMF IV chemo. The SE's are minimal and it would be done every 3 weeks at the end of the day. Once they get the Impact results, they can change my treatment if necessary. She didn't think that I should jump to any of the other IV chemo since the SE's are much more harsh. Crazy thing is that I just got back my TM's and they did go up-albeit VERY little and are still w/i normal. So Weird!!!!!! I'm scheduled for CMF next Thursday. Thoughts? Input? Babs",

So I had my brows micro bladed and they looked better than my own. I went to have false eyelashes done professionally but there was nothing for them to adhere the individual lashes to. I was soooo upset. Someone suggested I go to Sephora and the lovely make up person there sold me and put on lashes for me. As she advised they barely lasted the night but that's all I wanted. The hair was the hardest for me. I do have a great wig thanks to my boss ( he's the number 1 hair transplant dr in NYC) I hate how I look in it. I think I look like a religious person. But the bottom line is that I was there to enjoy her wedding. I got to share this special day with her. And she has the memory of my being there ( My mom died of bc one year before I got married). Whatever you look like all she wants us you there. And that's all you really want too. Enjoy all the planning with her. These are the important memories she and you need to have.

(yes, it was a different kind of cancer but this story applies to any and all cancers) None of us have a crystal ball. We could get hit by a car tomorrow. But, being stage iv makes us way more aware of our mortality. So, live and enjoy your life. Try not to get bogged down with what's going on with you. Find what you love and make sure to do/enjoy it. For me, spending time with those I love is what brings me the most joy. To that end, I moved closer to my DD and visit my parents in Fla more often. I try to live my life as \"normally\" as I can. I'm working f/t and enjoying living in NYC now. Years ago, stage iv was a death sentence-it no longer is. Now, with all the therapies and treatments out there we can live our lives. Some txts will work and others won't. A good friend who's in ca research tells me that every year new treatments come out and because of this hopefully, I'll live long enough to get the txtment that will knock my mets to NED for a very long time. Make sure you have a great support system. You'll find the women here a great source of support and information. There will be those who say stupid things to you- mainly out of fear (Mary K I think that's why your love said what he did) You need to educate them and to tell them how what they said makes you feel because the last thing anyone really wants to do is to hurt or to upset you. You will have times when your mind goes to that \"dark\" place-it does with all of us. But, let it out and then get into your fight mode to deal with the next situation that comes up. I wish your treatments bring you to to NED sooner rather than later! Babs ",

Went yesterday for the study again-temp, blood pressure glucose, weight and 4 vials of blood and then meeting with the study nurses. Monday is the liver biopsy and then Tuesday another appointment- so much time for this! Babs",

They\u2019re doing 10 whole brain radiation treatments and at the same time they\u2019ll be doing spinal rads. Afterwards I go back on chemo. I think it will be back to Halaven which I tolerate ok. Will lose what Hair I have and will prob have some short term memory loss. The dr was very optimistic about the brain rads. She claims they have great success when the Mets are extensive but small. I pray she\u2019s right. I\u2019m still working FT. I had the \u201ctalk\u201d with my boss. He\u2019s willing to accommodate me in any way he can. He only wants me as his office manager. He made me cry he\u2019s just the best! My Dd and Anton are still staying with me until 9:17 and I\u2019m making Rosh Hashanah. My DD wanted to do the holiday as did my brother but as long as I can i want to keep things as they\u2019ve always been done. I\u2019m crazy. Of course I\u2019ve made adjustments- bringing in all sides which I usually make. Oh well As long as we\u2019re all together! I\u2019m having some major difficulties. I have trouble walking ( I must hold on to something) and cant stand for more than 2-3 minutes. I\u2019m still coughing due to the lung mets and sometimes have difficulty talking. I have shortness of breath from walking just a few feet. I can\u2019t pick up my grandson. I walk like a drunk and easily get very tipsy. I feel old and worn out all the time. It\u2019s really rough. My hemmoroids are ablaze and out and I\u2019m soooo constipated it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m getting terrible leg and hand cramps. I hate to complain and don\u2019t to anyone at home or at work but with my bc sisters I can be real. I\u2019m really not so sure how much more I can push myself. I\u2019m hoping I stay around until my DD has baby #2. ( I think they\u2019re trying but I haven\u2019t been told for sure). I start rads on Wednesday Just hope they work!

Two of the pills have to be refrigerated. So I brought a freezer pack with me on the flight thinking they would take the medication, put it in their refrig and put the ice pack in their freezer. NO! They would not be responsible for a customer's meds. While I did understand it was disappointing. My drugs were still cold after the flight (I kept them with me in the freezing flight cabin all the time- slightly narcotic about losing them!) Once we got to the hotel, they were put into the mini-frog. We gave the ice pack to the concierge who when we left found out that they didn't understand that it needed to be in a freezer-they kept it in their refrain so then we just asked them for a big bag of ice which we then traveled with to other hotels. Thank god all the other hotels understood about keeping n ice pack in a freezer!!!!! After two weeks away and lots of walking I can report that I managed to do almost everything I wanted. I did get tired but it was also sooooo hot. Not sure if my being tired was a function of the meds or the heat to be honest. We had a great time and truly enjoyed without the worry of missing a chemo treatment. This Thursday as my second (and thankfully last) 8 hour day at MSKCC. Got to MSKCC w/o eating or drinking as required Here's my day 8:30 appointment time 9:15 finally taken-weight, temp, O2 levels, blood pressure, finger stick for glucose level and eKG. They tried to get an IV line in due to all the blood draws needed but alas my veins didn't want to cooperate. I guess 2 weeks away wasn't enough! After 3 tries and two different nurses they called in a Sr. nurse who has been successful with me before and yes, the line got in. They did have trouble getting the 10 vials needed but finally it was done at 10:15. My poor arm! The study nurse gave me my pills to take at 10:20. 10:50-another blood drawer -only 2 vials and vitals. Blood was VERY slow to come out-really an issue 11:20 another blood drawer-again an issue getting the 2 vials. Vitals done and EKG 12:20-another blood drawer- getting even harder to get 2 vials. Vitals done 1:20 I could eat (3 hours after taking the meds) 2:20 vitals, EKG and major issue getting the 2 vials of blood so they pulled the IV line and did a stick-still hard to get the 2 vials. 6:20 vitals, EKG and stick for the 2 vials of blood. They tried a new spot altogether and no issue. Thank god! In between the 12:20 and 2:20 I went home to rest and to eat at 1:20. I also went home and took a nap in-between the 2:20 and 6:20. Actually I played down to watch TV and passed out and woke up just in time to get back for the 620 . At the end of the day I went home and basically vegged out- soon very tired. Friday- 8:20 appointment for vitals, EKG and 2 vials of blood- no issue today. FYI Woke up in the middle of the night-actually Friday early AM and went on the MSKCC portal to see that my CA 15-3 went from 590 down to 380!!!! Yes so we think this is really working. Will know for sure when I get my scan in 30 days. Babs",

Went to MSKCC without eating or drinking anything since the night before 8:30. Took weight, finger stick, EKG, temp and blood pressure 9:00 Met with my MO then study nurse. Took my GDC0077 and Letrozole at 9:48. Nurse went over all the protocol, gave me a diary to keep, and gave me a cold pack for the GDC0077. It must be refrigerated. Am not allowed to eat until 3 hrs after taking the meds. 1018. Must have many vials of blood taken about 1/2 hr after taking the pills. Of course my veins had an issue so I'm a little black and blue now. Also took temp and blood pressure. 11:48 ekg 12:48 temp blood pressure and lots more blood drawn I can eat now. I was soooo hungry and thirsty. Lucky for me I live 1 1/2 blocks from Mskcc so I went home. I actually fell asleep! Guess I didn't sleep that well last night due to being anxious about today. 3:48 temp blood pressure and more blood taken. Glad the needle is finally out of my arm! 5:48 ekg. And all leads removed Long day but unlike most I can go home in between so it's easier for me Tomorrow I report at anywhere from 9:18-10:18. on an empty stomach again There is a 1/2 hr window before or after the initial time pills are taken for every part of the day The worst part of the day for me was the blood draws. Even though they left everything in all day they did have trouble getting the blood to flow so they had to manipulate the needle. Ouch!!! Will report on tomorrow! Babs ",
