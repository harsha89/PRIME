    "Content": "traver03 wrote: Hi Everyone: Had my appointment with the surgeon today. Believe it or not, he felt a lump on my OTHER breast, as well. He ultrasounded both masses, both are solid, but he says he feels confident that they will be fibroadenomas....that they don't look \"ugly\" on ultrasound. I have breast implants so based on where they are located, he wants to go straight to excisional biopsy instead of doing the core biopsy and possibly rupturing an implant. They've scheduled this for Monday, which is a good thing, but I'm always terrified of anesthesia, etc., although I'm glad that I will know something next week. He made me feel a little better but I'm still wondering, \"what if\" and very stressed out that I am dealing now with both breasts instead of just the one that I thought. I'm thankful that he did find it instead of doing surgery on one and then finding out about the other and having to go right back in. Still in the waiting and wondering mode but I'm hoping to know next week...Has anyone else out there had bilateral breast excisional biopsies....I'm wondering how sore I am going to be??
