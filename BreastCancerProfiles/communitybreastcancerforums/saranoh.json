The chemo she is on now makes her pretty sick for like a week after treatment. She doesn't like to share a lot of information, and I try to respect what she wants to share, and to be there for her in any way I can, including listening to her and talking to her when she is struggling with her down days and being excited for her when she has her good days. I hope this question doesn't come across as selfish, because what I'm wondering is if it's still ok to talk to my mom about my problems. She was always my person, we talked every day and she gave me advice and supported me through everything in my life. Since being diagnosed, we talk less because she doesn't feel well. I live far away from her. I had some relationship stuff happen and I really want to talk to her about it now, but I don't want to burden her with my problems when she is going through so much. Basically, I guess my question is, is it still ok to talk to my mom about what's going on with me, or is it too much of a burden with everything she is going through with her cancer?",
