One big hard lump on the left and one smaller on the right near my nipple. When I went to see a doctor he was able to feel a total of 3 hard lumps on my right beast. When I went to take an ultrasound only one lump was seen and it was the one I felt first on my right as I have mentioned earlier. I've been feeling breast pain even before I discovered the lump on my left breast but not to often as last december. I also had a back pain on The upper part for almost a week even when I tried stretching it didn't workand now I noticed that my left breast differ in size from my right breast. What should i do?
