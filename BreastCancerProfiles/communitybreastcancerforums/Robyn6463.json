They say a partial on Tuesday, and if I need any reconstruction I can have it done in a year. One of the blessings of large breasts I guess, there's some tissue to spare?  Haven't had the genetic testing yet, but PS (out of her league here maybe) suggested that I consider a total hysterectomy as I've had cervical cancer also. Anybody have any thoughts or suggestions here? It's not like I'm using the ovaries/uterus. The cancer drugs will cause all the same side effects anyway, right? Is there any reason not to do this...aside from another surgery? I think my instinct says wait for the genetic testing...but I'd just as soon get rid of any spare parts I'm not using that have the potential to do me harm. ",

It's rainy and dreary here today, and it would have been really easy to stay in bed after everybody left this morning. But alas, 17 yo son missed his school bus, so I had to get up, showered, dressed, and drive him to school. It might have been a good thing, or I'd still be in bed with the TV! I stopped at my friends' store for a coffee on the way back, and caught up with them... These friends have offered me a golden retriever puppy, to be born next week...ready for adoption about 8 weeks later. I already have 2 dogs, a 9 yo pug/boston terrier mix, and some kind of stupid, giant hound that's 3 years old and out of control (my son's dog). I REALLY don't need another dog, but I would love one. Especially a golden retriever. Free. Hubby says no, but he's manageable. Part of me says no, too, but part of me feels like this could be part of my recovery, my own affirmation that I think I'll live the 15 or so years I need to take care of it. Very undecided at the moment....well, not undecided, I make up my mind firmly, and then change it every hour. Hmmm... ",

Every time she tries it we mess around for 2 1/2-3 hours, but two other nurses have managed to access it immediately. She's very nice, knowledgeable, and otherwise very professional, so I feel funny saying something, but could this really be a coincidence?  I can't wait for this to be over!

Mary's correct. The Tamoxifen is if you are premenopausal, Femara for post. My original plan was 2 years of Tamo, then 5 Femara (I think, it might have been 5 +2), until we decided to remove my ovaries as well. Now I've got a prescription for Femara which I'll take for 5 years. I've gained about 4 pounds through treatment. My weight is stressing me, I've got about40 lbs I'd like to lose. Recovery this time is taking a bit! Sore toes this morning! Funny taste in my mouth! I only got out of bed long enough to shower yesterday! But this is it!

I didn't initially realize it was a picture of a wig, and thought, wow, I'd be upset at the idea of losing all that beautiful hair too! It looks awesome on you!  Madismommy-I had benadryl during my first infusion, and keep some on hand for emergencies all the time. (My son is allergic to everything). No claritin though. Probably because I've taken zyrtec every day for years for my own allergies. I think it made me REALLY sleepy the first week or so that I took it, but it's been so long.... Leighsa - Oncotype 15 isn't bad. Mine was 21, and I spent a long time thinking about chemo. Still having second thoughts, but the docs support it, and that makes me more confident that I've made the right choice. While all my test results have been good, they've had these little caveats attached...my excision did not have clear margins the first time, so she scraped more tissue...my lymph node was initially positive, then negative at final pathology. They found a second, apparently unrelated tumor in the additional tissue excision. I just worried that one stupid cell would be floating around in my lymphatic system and come back and kill me 7 years from now. Just like it did to my aunt. This is my second cancer. So chemo it is. Here I am.  Welcome Taylor. I'm worried about my port placement also. I had my first treatment, and they had trouble with my veins, so the nurses asked for it. I see the surgeon on Monday, placement on 8/30, next treatment on 9/2. Wish I could have skipped this step with only 3 treatments to go.  Chrys - I agree. The aches are horrible! My husband says I'm still moaning in my sleep! My nauseau hasn't been too bad. Very irregular digestive tract though. From D to constipated then back to D...wish it would make up it's mind!  Koalakid - That must have been a tough surgery decision. I'll go through the genetic testing and counseling in October. I can easily decide to do a prophylcatic hysterectomy, (wanted it done when they took the lump) but I'll have a harder time giving up my breasts. The docs have done such a nice job so far, not perfect, but I'm not going to change another thing cosmetically. Unless I've got the stupid gene. Then it's decision time.   Okay - wig decision. There's no place local for me to go try one on, so I've been putting it off. (I sympathize with those of you who live a long way from your treatment centers). All your comments about the ones you've bought on-line aren't very reassuring! I've got another week+ before I need it, cut my hair really short already. I really can't decide. Maybe I'll do some on-line searching for providers... It's another beautiful day in Southern Vermont. Baby shower for my best friend this afternoon. Her c-section is scheduled for 9/2, the same time as my next treatment. I need to go shopping! Hope everyone feels well today! ",

I really didn't want to have one, but when I went it on Tuesday, it took them 5 sticks to get blood, so I lost the argument instantly! I get my port on Tuesday - hubby is bringing me.  vtellen - Maybe it's a Vermont thing again - I haven't had any other scans or tests either. When I've asked I've been told it's not necessary, although I'll probably have a bone scan at some point because of the osteoporosis risks. Hmm. Maybe I'll talk to my GP. He's a bit more aggressive.  Madismommy - wow, 9 hours! I'm so worried about running out of sick time, I keep pushing myself, but I'm feeling so unproductive. It probably isn't worth the effort. I've got a call in to HR to see how much time is in the donated sick bank. I've got lots of work to do today, and a big day Monday, then some admin stuff for a while.  Have a great weekend everybody.

On another note, I got to watch the Red Cross land a couple of helicopters outside the window. They're delivering cases of water bottles to the hospital, town water main is broken.

For a rural community, it's a very nice hospital. With free parking! And I love all of my docs so far! The cancer center hasn't been there all that long, when my Mom was sick in 1989 we had to travel between Latham, NY, and Dartmouth, NH for her surgeries and treatments. I have a fat face (okay I'm a little overweight everywhere), so I thought the pixie cut would make me look fatter, but it's actually pretty flattering. My 17 yo son seems to like it! The ultimate compliment! But alas, it'll be a short-lived style (no pun intended). At least I'll know what to do when it starts to grow back. ",

I got the burning sinus thing from the Cytoxin a little at the end, and she had to slow down the Taxotere because I got all flushed and felt kind of a head rush, and of course, they had to switch my IV over halfway through - they're making me an appointment for a port after all because they had too much trouble with my veins today. But I had a good day, saw some old friends, and now I'm ready for my nap! Hope everyone else is well!!!!! I'm feeling so much better than I expected, just really tired!  ",

I'm dreading it, because the bone pain was excruciating just from the taxotere - even without the neulasta. Vicodin didn't touch it. She suggested one vicodin and 2 ibuprofen for the pain next time.  I've still got a couple of mouth sores, really scratchy throat, but no fever. My stomach isn't normal yet, but nothing to really complain about. So - to work I go! Have a great day everybody! I hope you all are feeling well!",

My surgeon went back and \"scraped\" additional tissue two more times, and felt confident that she had all of the tumor in the end. The pathologist agreed, but in that scraped tissue, they discovered a second tumor, apparently unrelated to the first. I didn't find that good news, but they assure me that radiation will take care of any thing that could possibly have been left behind. Whew. Good luck today to Chrys, Grimbol and everybody else having infusions today! My second one is Friday, the halfway mark! 44 days to go for me! Then rads!  Port placement yesterday was not so much fun. The small incision on my neck is very painful, can't turn my head, really sore throat. Just spoke with nurse, I might need to run in and get checked out. Ugh. One thing after another.  I haven't done anything to my hair either, since that first pixie cut. It's coming up by itself, pretty drastically, I've got about 15% of it left. Scalp is a little pink, but no tingling or anything. I'm hoping some of it will stay, that's why I can't bring myself to shave it!  Glad things went well VTEllen. I'm not looking forward to days 4-7 either. The bone pain was horrible. I'm also dreading the neulasta shot that they've threatened me with, but still hoping to avoid it! I also had one brief \"tingly\" episode. It lasted about 45 minutes and hasn't come back at all. Hoping that stays away!  Taylor, I hope all went well. My kids are all wearing charms, bracelets, stickers, etc., but I'm not yet. Not really. I've got an \"I love boobies\" pink rubber bracelet that my 17 yo son and I take turns wearing for luck on transfusion days, surgeries, appointments,etc. Madismommy, I'm so sorry your little girl is scared. I think my 6 yo grandson is, too. He hasn't spoken up yet, and I've asked a couple of times because he just looks a little lost, but we've been pretty honest with him. My prognosis is excellent, so we've got lots of confidence when we talk to him and I think that helps. He loves my new red wig!  Happy Anniversary Grimbol! I'm having the genetic testing done in October, so I'll be waiting for results at that point. I'd love to have those behind me too!  Have a great day, no s/e's everybody! Vermont is drying out, the sun is shining, but it'll be a long time before we're all back to normal here! ",

Had a thermal ablation in 1998, so no periods since then, but I still have my ovaries and uterus. I was, indeed, post-menopausal, no estrogen at 48, but have never had a hot flash. Onco thought she'd mix the two meds, just because of my age, 3-5 years of one, and then 2 more of another. I forget if the tamoxifen comes first, or the other one. Note to ask that question on Friday. My follow up with the breast surgeon is in January, but I'll have to see her to get the port removed. Hopefully sooner rather than later. I'm up for my last treatment on Friday, and can't wait to have it over with! Not looking forward to the recovery, as this last one was so much worse than the first 2! But it's the last one!  I was just thinking about the return mammo. They said every 6 months for a while, and I'm at 4 months now! Does that mean December? Of course, they did an MRI in July, and they'll do a CT next week, so they should show stuff too, right? I'm going to be so paranoid about stuff growing in me from now on!  I see the genetic counselors on Monday, to do the BRCA test and go over family history.  So Chrys and Ellen, since you guys are the first ones done, you'll have to let us know about your hair.

I know I'm about to feel cruddy for the next few weeks, but this time I don't have to cry and find the courage to do it again, so I think maybe a more positive attitude will help me deal with it all. On Monday, which will probably be my worst day, I meet with the genetic counselors. MO and I decided today on an oopherectomy in January, regardless of the genetic testing. That test will now simply determine if the uterus goes with the ovaries or not. She wants me to get rid of the estrogen production completely, and I agree. It makes a difference on my meds, too, 5 years instead of 7. And less of a risk of bone loss. I don't know what I'll do about my breasts if I've got the gene yet. I'd like to keep them, but it depends on my risk I guess. Thursday I have the simulation, tattoos, CT scan, etc., and my friend Susan showed me the room and machine and told me it really isn't all that scary. I shouldn't need anti-anxiety meds, but I can take them if I want, and she'll make sure I get home safely one way or another. She REALLY helped alleviate some of my fear! She's AWESOME! (My oldest daughter's MIL happens to be the receptionist at the radiation cener), Hmm..what else. Port out in 3-4 weeks. Thank God! I can see the eye doc in December, my eyes should be back to \"normal\" by then.  Doc actually wrote me the presciption for the drugs I'll start taking in January, to help me use up my flexible spending plan balance for this year, I've got stuck with almost $800 left in there, so this might help. So will the glasses.  Flowers from my oldest daughter today, and the flower delivery store just called for directions, so more on the way. I got an awesome book in the mail from a co-worker, a couple of cards. It's really been an awesome day overall. It's a good thing, 'cause my husband's still being A HUGE JERK!

I'm much more concerned financially about running out of sick time. I've got about three weeks left, so I'm trying to work when I can, but I'm so overwhelmed by everything I don't feel terribly productive.My kids and friends are taking me to treatments, so my husband can keep putting in some overtime... I'm really sorry about the hair loss, too ladies. Kasi and Madismommy you do both have awesome hair! Mine's not nearly as pretty, it's thin, but I'm still very upset. It's been shoulder length for years, and I just had a pixie cut this afternoon. I'm actually enjoying it...for a week or so! But I'm really afraid I'll look like Uncle Chester before this is all through. I can't wait for it to grow back and it hasn't even fallen out yet!   Up for first treatment in the morning!

Completely unrelated:-) Spoke with doc about vision. She suggested lubricating drops. Evidently the dry eye thing interferes with vision. She also suggested NOT getting new glasses until this is all over. So, I'm using Systane drops.  My GP suggested medical marijuana, whihch I didn't know is legal in Vermont. But the staff at the cancer center laughed when I mentioned it. Haven't gone there yet...but after this last treatment it's sounding more intriguing!  Got my appointment shedule yesterday to begin - AND FINISH - radiation.

We have breast cancer, and while that is not nearly as terrifying as it was a couple of decades ago, we have very good reasons to be down! When this is all over, we'll be ourselves again! If not, then we can talk about anti-depressants. I read some advice in the paper last week by a breast cancer survivor, and she instructs us to allow ourselves to have bad days. It's okay! This sucks and we're supposed to have bad days! When all this is behind us, the bad days will be too! And we're getting there! We are the AUGUST group, and it's OCTOBER now. We're making progress!!!!

I am so lucky, and grateful, to have my cancer center only about 6 miles from home. They've actually got an accredited breast health program, and they're incredible.

It was pretty fun, and there are so many of us in the northeast. I'm hoping that's just a weird phenomena and we aren't suffering from some kind of environmental fluke???? But wherever...maybe someplace warm and tropical would be nicer than Nova Scotia!  VtEllen - When I first talked to my GP about my diagnosis, I tried to laugh it off by saying I'd get nice perky new breasts out of this, and he cut me off quick and said \"this is no laughing matter. You could die from this.\" Duh! That's what I was afraid of, and why I was trying to make it a little lighter! Ah well, I really do love him, he's just so male...sometimes even good guys don't say the right thing, despite good intentions. My husband had his own biopsy this morning, he's had melanoma, (and colon cancer), and in his own anxiety my first chemo treatment actually slipped his mind. I couldn't decided whether to be hurt or sympathetic.  Kasi - thanks for easing my mind about the port. Not crazy about it, but they really have been struggling with my veins, three tries for the surgery, twice today...I'm pretty tough, and the sticks don't bother me too bad, but they don't like to mess around that much.  Sandi - I got a pixie cut yesterday, they took about 10\" off. It's the shortest my hair has been since I was 7! And I love it! I'm sad that this will fall out too, but at least I know I can live with the short style when it starts to grow back! I'm adjusting in stages....",

I'm feeling better today - MUCH better today. Worked a little bit this morning, and promised more for the rest of the week. My first T/C was on Friday. I had diarrhea at first, then the dreaded constipation, indigestion...stomach pain, but not much nausea. But the muscle aches are horrible! My husband says I keep moaning in my sleep! Finally took a Vicodin last night, and I think it helped! Haven't really had the bad taste in my mouth, so I can't weigh in on the great Biotene debate yet!  I had to ask specifically for the Oncotype Dx test. My insurance did cover it after review. But my score was 21. In the mid-range. I could have skipped the chemo, but my oncologist said she thought that she would do chemo if it was her...and I figure she's the smart one here. My GP agreed, he was voting for chemo even before the test. He believe you should buy whatever extra insurance you can with this stuff!!! So, chemo it is. And now that I've committed, I needed to be talked back into it after the 1st treatment! Had some trouble with the IVs during the infusion, and the nurses are insisting I get a port. With only 3 treatments left. Part of me thinks that the nurses just don't want to mess with my veins, which aren't all that bad I don't think. I don't think my onco nurses are very good at it...maybe they don't get a lot of IV practice because of ports? At any rate, port placement is scheduled for 8/30, next treatment 9/2. And the happy news, my best friend has her C-section scheduled at the same time as my infusion! The new baby will be exciting happy news in the middle of this!  I have two wonderful dogs, also, as well as two kitties and my son's pet turtle! They are awesome company on the rare days that I'm home alone. Hope you all are feeling well. Welcome new people! Sorry we have to get together here! ",

The machine does get pretty close to my face, and the angles are pretty close to my chin, so that's probably why I'm moving my head to the side. Other than the fatigue, probably still left over from chemo, and the warm breast, I've had no other radiation s/e's so far.  Off to get the puppy today!!!!! ",

I'm feeling almost normal. My onco calls it \"the new normal\" but it's pretty good to feel like myself again. Working full time, growing my hair back, walking off some of the weight. Some trouble with lymphedema, but compared to others, it's not too bad. Taylor, it sounds like you're doing well,too!",
