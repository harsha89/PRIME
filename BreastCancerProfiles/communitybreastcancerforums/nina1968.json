I found a lump on the side of my breast last oct, I went to my family dr she sent me for tests and sent me to a surgen, He also sent me for test n said he was not concerned i just have lumpy breasts which i knew. I should tell you my mom had brest cancer. When i went to see my gyn she found the lump on her own n said it felt a little hard in the midddle about half to 3/4 of a cen. Went to see a diff surgen n said she thinks everything will be ok but since my mom had brest cancer we should boipsy. I am really nervous about the biopsy, Just wanted someone to talk to Iam 38 almost 39. Iam really hoping it is nothing. Sorry this is so long Log in to post a reply",
