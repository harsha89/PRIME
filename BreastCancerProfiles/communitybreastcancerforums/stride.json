A few people on this discussion board and another have mentioned concerns about Benadryl injections. I'm getting Benadryl injections with my chemo, which is TAC. I really don't mind it. It is relaxing and puts me to sleep right away, and that's kind of a blessing in the chemo chair. But between the Benadryl and the Ativan, I'm a couch potato for the first four days after chemo. I really admire those of you who keep up with your normal routines after chemo. I have been missing about a week of work with each treatment. I am extremely grateful to have had virtually no bone pain with the Neulasta. I hope the same for everyone starting Taxol. I'd love to hear from anyone doing TAC. I had my fourth treatment last Wednesday, two more to go. I am beginning to have some muscle weakness in my thighs, but oddly enough I feel it more when I am relaxing than when I am exercising. The chemo knocks me back too much to do anything strenuous, but I walk every day and do some light calisthenics. My worst symptoms are digestive, but I started taking Prilosec and they have gotten more manageable. ",

I'm mostly just walking and doing some easy calisthenics. My chemo is neoadjuvant too, and the tumor has already shrunk by more than half.  Your work schedule sounds really good. How did you work that out with your employer? Do you have to take unpaid leave for those 11 days? I'm burning through sick and vacation time pretty quickly, and I'm probably going to have to request unpaid FMLA leave if this fatigue continues. I get chemo on Wednesdays and take the Wednesday-Friday off. I try to work from home the following Monday-Wednesday, but those days are rough and I'm not very productive. Occasionally I have to hand stuff off to coworkers, which I feel really bad about. Today I went to work in the morning and just hit a wall. It was surprising and frustrating because I'm mid-cycle. But I was so tired, sore and drippy I thought I might be coming down with a cold or flu. So I came home at lunch, napped for two hours and then worked from home. My bosses will give me that flexibility every once in awhile, but this cannot be a regular pattern. In the very first week I went to work on the Friday after chemo, day 3 in the cycle. I can't imagine trying that now. How the heck do some people have chemo and then just go to work later that day? I can't even relate to that. Maddie57, thanks for the vaseline tip. I'm going to have to try that. These allergies, or whatever they are, tend to be worst in the middle and end of each cycle, which I don't understand. There must be something in the chemo, or maybe the steroids, that treats the allergies, and then the symptoms return. Ann, do they take a lot of blood? For me the blood tests are just a pinprick in the finger. They shouldn't need much for a blood cell count. ",

Open-heart surgeries, now that's a big deal! Recovering from that must have been a real challenge. Soltantio, what supplements do you use? I am taking B-complex and magnesium for the neuropathy, as recommended by my oncology nurse. I am also taking fish oil and sprinking ground flaxseed into my food, just for kicks. I eat good Greek yogurt daily, or nearly daily, so I get some probiotics through that. I also use protein powder in the hope that will help rebuild muscle. I have read that Vitamin C may inhibit the effectiveness of Adriamycin, which works by creating free radicals, but it can also limit the risk of heart damage. I have been taking an occasional multivitamin, but not megadoses, to kind of hedge my bets.",

I started chemo on June 27 and not July, but hopefully you'll all forgive me. ;-) I have finished three of six TAC treatments. My worst problem has been this feeling in my stomach I could not describe that made it nearly impossible to eat just about any kind of solid food. Last Friday my doctor told me I should be taking Prilosec. ALL her patients take Prilosec. Well, I didn't know! HUGE difference. I am eating normal food again. Wanted to pass this along in case anyone else is having the same problem. Other than that, I'm wondering if anyone else is having eye issues. My eye is kind of watery, but the lids kind of stick together when I blink. I wake up in the morning with gross crusty stuff on the sides of my eyes. I don't think they are infected. I had the same problem toward the end of my last chemo cycle, and it cleared up when I had chemo treatment. Now in the third week of the cycle, and it has started again. I'm using eyedrops, but wondering what is causing this. Have a good night! ",

Add to that Prilosec, anti-nausea pills, steroid pill, Gas-X and fluids, followed by more fluids. It's like walking a tightrope.  Here are some things that worked for me the last three days: peanut butter crackers; banana; prune juice; Smooth Move Tea; peach-ginger tea; Greek yogurt with a sprinkle of ground flaxseed for fiber; chicken broth with brown rice; rice cake with tuna and a few dried cranberries for fiber; quesadilla made with whole wheat tortilla, chicken pieces, avocado and a little cheese; applesauce sprinkled with chopped walnuts. Gas-X three or four times per day, Senakot tablets once a day and either prune juice or Smooth Move tea at some other point in the day. A little bit of Metamucil or a fiber bar if I think I'm not getting enough fiber.  Actually, writing this made me feel a whole lot better. I have managed pretty well!  But I'm with you, Ann.

Melanieb, this is a good, caring board to be on. I second everyone who says seek out support services. You are certainly not alone. I have read a lot about survivors experiencing depression after treatment. Skimommi, the ability to work during chemo is really dependent on the individual, the work environment and the response to chemo and Neulasta/Neupogen. I am in awe of the women who were able to work all the way through chemo. I had three week cycles of TAC, and took the first few days to about a week-and-a-half off. Somebody on here had not taken a sick day in 11 years. I find that simply amazing.  Maddie57 sent me a message, which I really appreciated. I had surgery on November 7, right mastectomy and left lumpectomy. Compared to chemo, it was a piece of cake! Still waiting for pathology report, but my surgeon took out five nodes and all looked clear. So things are definitely looking up!",

My surgeon took off as much skin as she could while still being able to close the wound, and she took off a slice of the pectoral muscle. So I'm hopeful she got it all. Last time I talked to my onco, she wanted me to have genetic testing and consider a clinical trial of Halaven.

I left my tumor size out of my diagnosis because I do not really know what to say. I am an A cup, and easily discovered a large, fast-growing lump in April. It was a roughly 2cm tumor, and had an attached cyst about the same size that collapsed during a later needle biopsy. My BS put the tumor at 4.5cm by ultrasound measurement a couple of weeks later. By the time I started neoadjuvant TAC in June, my MO said the tumor was 7.5cm, but that was not an ultrasound measurement. The tumor shrunk significantly during my first 2 rounds of chemo. My BS and MO examined me after the third round and pegged it at 2.5cm. I told them I thought it had stopped shrinking by then and might even be growing, but my BS was pleased by the response to the chemo and thought it would shrink more. So I am scheduled for a lumpectomy and radiaion. I am having an MRI later this week and will meet with my BS next week. I think the tumor is at least 2.5cm still, probably more. I am so small-breasted that the tumor is large enough to be somewhat disfiguring, and I am constantly aware of it. I think I will probably need some sort of reconstruction even with a lumpectomy, and am trying to figure out my options. I am also questioning whether I should just have a mastectomy and skip radiation, but the lumpectomy has been scheduled for weeks and I am reluctant to change paths mid-stream. My MO said the BS would not be planning a lumpectomy if she did not think she could get it, which makes sense.  Anyway, that was long-winded. But I'm hoping more people will post to this thread, because I think it's a good one to keep going.",

I started carboplatin/gemzar and completed whole brain radiation. It was difficult doing chemo and WBR at the same time, but doable. The cancer appears to be a mixed type--some tumors are moderately PR+ and some tumors are TN. I am in my third cycle of carbo/gemzar, and will have a follow-up CT scan in a couple of weeks. I know it has been effective on a tumor in my neck muscle, which was quite painful before. And I also suspect it has knocked back my lung tumors. I don't think it has touched the bones, and I'm not sure about the liver and other organs. Chemo has not stopped the development of new, palpable tumors on my chest, back and abdomen. My prognosis is poor, and I have accepted that (most of the time, anyway). My goal is to live a relatively symptom-free and side-effect-free life for as long as I can. I have been quite lucky that the effects of the cancer have been fairly minimal so far. I was hiking and kayaking with my husband only the week before the CT scan that showed the metastases. I hope that gives people some hope--even if cancer becomes ridiculously widespread, it may still be possible to live a good quality of life. Of course I had the advantage of having no clue that the cancer had spread all over. But I think it shows that at least part of this fight is mind over matter. I did not know I was supposed to be too sick to hike and kayak. Deyla, how did the radiation in your T12 cause a compression fracture? I didn't know that could happen. Does the bone compress to fill in the space where the tumor was? I had radiation to a vertebra in my neck at the same time as whole brain radiation. ",

Still, I think the chemo was effective systemically because my lymph nodes have shrunk. And the tumor is about half what it was at peak. I am meeting with the breast surgeon on Monday, but I would imagine I'll have to have a mastectomy now. I'm surprised about FEC-T, haven't run into many people getting that. Do you know why they selected tht regimen? Shells, did you have it before or after surgery?",

For most people, that is just not the case, and I felt deceived. I had taxotere, adriamycin and cytoxan every three weeks for six treatments. It generally took about a week to recover. Side effects really vary from person to person and can get progressively worse as you have more treatments. Can your employer be flexible with you?",

I've been wondering if medical supply stores are really the best place for this kind of thing. I had good luck getting a good shower grip just through Amazon.com. That website has user reviews, which I find helpful. You could try plugging in the brand name on Amazon to see if it comes up with user reviews.",
