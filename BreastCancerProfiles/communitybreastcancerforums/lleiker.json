There's no family history of cancer of any kind.  I have never been diagnosed with anything other than a squamous cell skin cancer on my nose.  I've gotten mammograms the last 2 years and they've looked really good.  I've been exhausted the last few months, but I thought it all had to do with new medication the doc gave me for my broken back. I'm usually a pretty calm, logical person but I'm totally freaking out. Thanks for giving me a place to vent.  I don't want to worry my family for nothing but yikes. Dx 2cm Log in to post a reply",
