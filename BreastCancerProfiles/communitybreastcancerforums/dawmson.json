I am one week out from my lump/SNB and I have a small lump right in my armpit under my SNB incision. When I put my arm close to my body it feels like I have a little ball tucked in there. It doesn't seem hard, so do you think it's fluid? I have a lot of numbness along the back of my arm, across my breast and sometimes down into my forearm. I am NOT liking that and really hope it goes away. My breast is also still swollen - the incision goes vertically along the lateral side of my breast and so the breast from the nipple all the way toward the side of my chest is swollen. The incision looks good, I think - still has the steri strip on top of it. I stopped wearing a sports bra today - I can't stand them and they seemed to make the swollen feeling worse. I get my path results tomorrow and I'm really losing a lot of sleep over it. I've been told that the chances of my diagnosis changing are really slim, but I keep remembering all the docs who told me early on when I was having mammos and U/S and MRI that \"we're just doing this test to rule out cancer; it's probably benign.\" So much for that story! :) ",

Thanks to everyone for your good thoughts about my final pathology. It really does feel like a huge relief to have that final info on what I have.  I'm going next Friday for my radiation-planning session. Not sure what that entails but I assume it's positioning for the radiation machines to do their work. I guess I'll start my treatments (6 weeks, 5x week) in October. The feeling of swelling under my arm is gone and the numbness is either receding or I'm getting used to it. I definitely still don't feel completely normal under there, however. The scar itself doesn't hurt at all but the muscle under my arm feels really tight, as if I need to stretch it. I'm going to see if PT would help.  There's a woman I met here in my same community who was diagnosed the same day as me - she had a UMX two weeks ago and then had to have emergency surgery last week to have a hematoma drained. Today she is getting her TE put in. So much surgery and recovery - I really feel for all of you ladies who have had UMX and BMX and are now getting ready for chemo (or have already done it) since that is such a tough road.  Nanadeb, I'm so sorry for all that you have been through. You are in my thoughts.  ",

I'm trying to get in as much normal life before I start rads in a few weeks.  Dixiebell - thanks so much for the cording info. I came on here to ask about it and was great to see your post and others' posts on dealing with it. I have it under my armpit and extending about halfway down the inside of my arm; it's a tightness/pain when I stretch my arm up over my head or if I extend it straight out with my palm facing out. Really frustrating to have to deal with all these side effects of SNB. I also still have numbness. At 4 weeks post-op I'm wondering if it will ever go away. I have a question about rads and the heart. I went in for a simulation last week at the RO office and afterward I got a message from the RO that I need to come back and get hooked up to a breathing machine that monitors my breathing and heart position. I don't fully get it but it means they had trouble figuring out a way to give me rads w/o hitting my heart. Scary! Has anyone else gone thru a breathing test? I'm freaking myself out about the idea of radiation getting thru to my heart. I also had a scare last week when I realized most of my left breast was a hard lump and that my nipple was starting to retract. It's better now but I'm going to ask the doc about it on Thursday when I go for my followup. Is it scar tissue? Cysts? Funny how my mind works, I immediately went to the \"OMG is it cancer again?\" place.   ",

I read that it can go away spontaneously and that's what happened to me. One day it was really sore to stretch my arm and the next day the tightness is completely gone. I hope it doesn't come back. In the meantime, stretching it gently is what my breast surgeon recommended to me. If it's really bad you can ask for PT sessions. I'm 1 month out from my lump/SNB and waiting on the RO to sign off on my treatment plan. I am so ready to get started on rads and get it over with! ",

That is my biggest nightmare, that I will go into this thinking everything will be smooth and then there will be a roadblock of something unexpected that will send me back out of control again. susanwmcg - Welcome home. Scary about the lack of pain meds but yay for only 2 drains. I'm 6 days away from my lumpectomy surgery and I think my need for control is showing up in weird ways. Our coffee machine has been malfunctioning (it's one of those fancy automatic espresso machines) and I have decided to try to fix it myself rather than schlep it to the repair shop 45 mins away. Good news is I think I fixed it!  I'm also reading Nordies at Noon, which my sister in law gave me. I have to admit it's giving me major anxiety but at the same time I am drawn to it, almost as if something is telling me I NEED to read it now. The way those women faced their breast cancer is so incredibly amazing. If I end up with 1/8 of their spirit and attitude I think I'll be doing OK.  As I think about my surgery I go back and forth between wishing that the docs will discover that my BC diagnosis was wrong, and worrying that they will discover that it is much worse than they expected. To everyone recovering this month - I wish you continued strength and rapid healing!",

It went well, the doc says - but we won't know the pathology til next Wednesday, however, In addition to the tumor they took 3 nodes and he said they were all \"soft\" - I hope that is a good sign. Recovery has been pretty good so far although the rest of my life hasn't been helping much. My daughter came home from the first day of school yesterday with a fever and clogged ears and still has the fever. I'm trying to keep my distance. And then yesterday, we found out the same daughter somehow got lice! We spent the morning getting her treated at a lice \"salon\" where I live- luckily she's the only one in the family to have it, the rest of us are clean. By the time we got home I was tired and really swollen under my arm and my breast. So I got into bed with an icepack for the afternoon. I'm blessed that my mom has been here and she took over everything so I could rest. I also have some numbness behind my arm, which is worrying me. It wasn't there yesterday but started this afternoon. The doc's office said that's probably from the SNB. Have any of you had it? It's not painful but it feels really strange. Well, my husband is telling me to get off the computer and rest my arm, so I better listen. :)  ",

I was practically shaking by the time he walked in. But there was good news - he got clean margins, and the final pathology was unchanged from the initial biopsy. He thought he had taken 3 nodes but the pathology showed 4 nodes, and all were negative. Whew!  The only little surprise was the confirmation that there was also an area of DCIS adjacent to the IDC. The initial biopsy said it was \"borderline\" but the final pathology confirmed it. It was also removed with good margins. I asked about the \"ball\" feeling under my arm and the numbness. He said the sensation of a ball is actually my scar, which is raised and has a ridge under it. Nothing he can do about that except time to heal and hopefully flatten. There's also some fluid, but not enough to draw out. The numbness he said may or may not go away --- which is a bummer, but I'm getting used to it. So, on to the next phase: radiation. I'm meeting with a MO and RO in a couple weeks.  ",

I've known about my cancer for about 2 months now and have spent the time trying to figure out which way I wanted to go. I went as far as signing the consent for a BLM with reconstruction and then had a change of heart and decided on the lumpectomy.  I had my pre-op appointment with my BS today and had a strange exam. He was attempting to find my tumor with ultrasound and said he had difficulty locating it (even though there was a clip in it from my core biopsy) and that it looked different than it did on my earlier U/S and mammograms. By different he meant smaller and much harder to see. He said it's possible that the biopsy removed most of the tumor (it was 9mm to start with). Does that sound plausible? When I go for surgery they'll do a wire localization to pinpoint it. Still, I'm hoping they find the right spot! I was happy to hear that it's only local anesthesia and sedation ... I assumed I'd be going completely under.  Thanks BlondeLawyer for starting this group. I'm in Seattle too. Debbie ",
