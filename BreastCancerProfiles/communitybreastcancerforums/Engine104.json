Hi everyone, My wife's TC protocol starts tomorrow. She seems ok with it, but I'm anxious, not so much with the infusion, but with the side effects that will be coming. We went to a chemo class today and, even though we've been through this before (My wife had AML 16 years ago), we learned a lot of new stuff. Anyway, this webpage and everyone here has been so helpful.",

They removed the drain and the PICC (Midline, really) when the IV antibiotics were done, but it started to drain a little from a spot on the incision, so they put off restarting the chemo for another week. If the drainage stops, she will have her second TC infusion next Thursday.

My wife is not really a social media person and she doesn't like to research things related to her treatment or diagnosis. In addition to being my wife's sole caregiver, I'm also dealing with the loss of two relatives this year and an increasingly frail mother (She turns 99 next week!) and an uncle (93) who fell and broke his hip last week. Fortunately, in my uncle's case, he has a daughter with a good-sized family, so I'm not involved in his care. For my mom, though, I am, though she is receiving great care at a board and care home near us. My wife has been doing walks each day with our dog for the last week or so. She has always been tough and had a very positive and humorous attitude through her previous cancer battles, as well as this one. I think attitude is so important to the outcome. For example, at the height of her post-mastectomy infection, she told the nurse, \"I thought I was growing my boob back.\" :)",

I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she had so much chemo 16 years ago when she had AML. It was a lot stronger too. The end result, I think, and one of the doctors mentioned this the other day too, is that her marrow is slow to respond and goes neutropenic pretty quickly, even with the Neupogen. We've been doing some research about 4 x 6 rounds of TC, The onco told us we could stop at 4 if she was having a hard time. I think three hospitalizations, including one for sepsis meets that criteria... But, it is something to discuss with the oncologist. I have some research if anyone is interested. I'm not necessarily advocating this, but it something to consider in her case, I think.",

She has labs today and then an oncologist appointment tomorrow and probably the 4th round of chemo on Thursday. We're going to bring up the drainage again, as well as possibly stopping after this round. I'll ask him what you mentioned as well. I think I'll also ask my brother in law. Thanks.  ",

I'm not one to second guess our doctors, but I do question the wisdom of starting the first round of TC only about two weeks after surgery. The pathology said the tumor was invasive, but not aggressive. I think it would have been ok to wait maybe two weeks longer, but I am not a doctor. 20/20 hindsight, I guess. I am concerned about some bleeding she is having when she urinates. We mentioned it to the doctors and they said we should check it with a GYN after this infection is resolved.

I'd like to think that part of that study was incorporated in changes between when she received radiation and how they do it now (Her previous BC was 22 years ago. They used to routinely do 8-10 weeks of high dose radiation ). Anyway, not once did she feel like a guinea pig or just a test subject. They always treated her with the upmost respect and kindness.

I had no idea when we got married 34 years ago that we'd have to deal with cancer three times, but it was for better or for worse, right :) Seriously, the good times far outnumber the bad. I am only familiar with my wife's chemo protocol (TC), so I'm not sure if your protocol reduces your blood counts to the point that you become very tired and susceptible to infections. I assume it does. If so, and your last chemo was a week ago, your counts would still be down, so it's not wise to be around large crowds right now. I remember you mentioning a while back about your radiation vis-a-vis your planned vacation. I think the vacation would be ok that far out from your chemo. I think this could have more to do with how you are doing emotionally. Believe me, I know about that. I've had an anxiety disorder for many years. Does your oncology office have a social worker? Ours does at Kaiser. They are there to let you talk things out. They are there because what you are feeling is not wrong or unusual. In any case, I'd suggest starting with speaking about this with your oncologist or a nurse coordinator there and see what they say. They may help put your mind at ease. I pray that this helps.",

The rabbi, an old friend of the family, said it was written in the Talmud that a person is excused from the fast on Yom Kippur (And all Jewish fast days) if it would be detrimental to their health. I remember from that time on, every year at Yom Kippur, the rabbi would tell the congregation the same thing he told my father. ",

I just heard back from my friend in FL. He is doing ok. Thankfully, his friends, both in law enforcement and the community, are helping him. I don't know if I mentioned that he suffers from PTSD, which is a result of an office involved shooting he was in last year. He had responded to an armed robbery at a bar and got into a shootout with the robbers. He's been on disability since then, so all of this is not helping that, unfortunately. It sounds like he is doing ok, though. What area does your son live in Chicago? Our son moved there after college. He lives in Palatine. We're planning to visit him Thanksgiving week.

We saw the surgeon today and he said what Janice has is a seroma, which is a collection of fluid within post mastectomy tissue. It happens about 35% of the time. These will heal over time and the surgeon feels this one will as well. It has been delayed by all of the chemo, but he thinks it will resolve on it's own. He said the fact that Janice's hair is starting to come back shows that her body is getting back to normal and that should help heal this. The only option is to reopen the incision and try to clean up the open spaces, but that means we go back to square one with drains, a new incision, etc and there is no guarantee this won't happen again. So, we're going to wait and see for a few months.. Thankfully, the drainage is pretty minimal most of the time.",

I've even thought about taking on a second job so that she might be able to cut back. I'm glad you are helping ladies in the surgery group.

As big a hassle as it is to come to the ER because of a fever, I think it is necessary to start meds right away. With chemo patients, there is always a chance the infection could go into Sepsis, which can be life threatening. On the other hand, I know my wife would have been much happier to have spent Mother's Day at home :)",

The problem was, when she had a lumpectomy on the same breast 22 years ago, they took as many nodes as they could find. That's how they did it back then. They were all negative, but it left nothing to test this time. So, we really don;t know for certain if a node would have been positive, etc. My son was initially very upset that my wife had chosen to do chemo, but when the oncologist explained to him that without it, we are looking at about a 40% chance of recurrence and with it, about 7% or 8%, he agreed with my wife's decision. I also read an article today in the L.A. Times about a woman with Stage 4 BC who had tried several treatments and all failed, but she was put on a new type of immuno-therapy and she is now in remission. It is a new method because previously solid tumors, such as BC and Colon, etc did not respond to that. This shows great promise, but it is probably several years away.",

The chemo, she said, is supposed to get rid of anything outside the area of where the tumor was. The radiation is to make sure nothing is still in the area. She said you probably need a break. I agree with her. My suggestion is to speak with your oncologist and see why he wants to start sooner than September. Blessings, -Larry",

She will meet with our regular OM the week after that. She was able to do labs today. Platelets, MCV and MCH look good, hemoglobin, WBC and RBC are still a little low.",

I explained what our situation has been and she said she will check with her boss and get back to me. We can handle a rate increase. Moving from an Anthem PPO to Kaiser HMO has dropped our monthly costs almost in half and we're much happier with the doctors and care we've been given than before. Janice's nails have come back. She had a mani/peddy yesterday :) Her hair is coming in in small thin strands. I think she'd be worried about scrubbing her scalp too much for fear of them coming out. I'll ask her about the shampoo.

Before this recurrence was found last month, every time my wife had a mammogram or a blood test after her AML, I'd go right back to that dark place of worry. \"Are our lives going to get turned up side down again?\" I believe strongly in the bible, and while it might not be the the way everyone copes, it helps me. Now, I try hard to remember Psalm 46:10, \"Be still and know that I am God.\" In other words, God is saying, \"I got this. Don't worry.\" There are many other verses I rely on that talk about anxiety and worry. Right now, with my wife's mastectomy about a week and a half away, I concentrate on taking this day by day, one thing at a time. If I don't, it will easily overwhelm both of us. \"What if she's unable to work again? What if at some point I am alone? She makes twice my salary, how will we survive?\" I can't dwell on that.

I wanted to ask the Onco about that, but didn't. Now, I wish I did. 20/20 hindsight and all that.. I also wish we'd pushed for the PIC line. My wife's veins are pretty marginal. We asked about it, but the onco's response was, \"Our chemo techs are really good at finding a vein.\" They were, but in all fairness, we weren't planning on all of the sticks they have had to do because of her hospital stay. My wife is getting Neupogen now and I'm told we can do injections at home in the future. I'm going to ask about the patch, but if we have to do shots, I am more than willing to do it if it saves us her from another hospital stay. Her counts are going up slowly, but the doctor said she'll be here until the fevers go away and the counts go higher, probably one or two more days. I want to wish all of you a very Happy Mother's Day! I hope it's a good one.",

Dear Falcon62, I am not going through this as you, my wife and so many other amazing women on here are, so I can't say (nor should I) that I know what you are going through. All I can tell you is my wife is also on TC. She developed thrush and a fever after her first infusion. I would talk to your doctor about this and see if they can make the second round easier with different meds to help with that and make the TC go easier. I know our onco told us that the goal is 6 rounds, but the therapeutic value of four rounds of TC is very similar to six, so if it is too hard, he said we can stop at four without much difference. You might want to ask the doctor about that in your case?",

The oncologist has agreed to let us wait until next week to do the second round of TC.We asked him because we wanted to be sure all of the infection is gone and the fluid has dissipated. We definitely don't want any fluid left behind to become infected once my wife's counts drop again. My brother in law, a retired oncologist and ER doctor, is coming to visit this weekend. What are your feelings about the new (TAILORx) study that states up to 70% of women with breast cancer can avoid chemo? Unfortunately in our case, they were not able to get a lymph node to test, so we don't know if that would have been negative, which, according to the study, is a key element in determining if a woman can avoid chemo.

One of the symptoms was sores like infected paper cuts on her fingers. The oncologist said it was leukemia cells coming through the skin. Within one day of chemo, the sores had almost disappeared. The doctor was very surprised and said it was clear evidence that the chemo was working. He brought the nurses in to look :) Obviously, the same can be said for you with the incredible difference in your scans. ",

Our MO and one of the oncology floor nurses had asked us if we'd done that before when she had a temp and we said no. They said we should try it next time and see if it helps. We'd always thought it might mask a higher fever (>100.4) and one that should be evaluated. I think regardless, if it had gone over 100.4, we would have gone to the ER.

Fortunately, she is not neutropenic, so they sent us home with 10 days worth of Keflex and said to let them know if she doesn't start feeling better in a few days. We're thankful they didn't have to admit her again. It looks like she has a UTI and maybe some infection from her surgical incision again. It started draining a lot again when her counts dropped.",

The drainage has slowed down a lot (Almost stopped), so I hope it stops by then. It may be as he said, that it is just taking a long time to heal because Janice's counts always got so low with the TC chemo and she had the septic infection there as well. Wow. I know that area well. My son's first apartment when he moved was on Rand Rd at about Dundee. He now lives by the nature preserve in Palatine. It's just west of Arlington Park race track. He went to Indiana U and missed all of his friends (They were all from the area and in Buffalo Grove) when he graduated and moved back home, so he looked for teaching and coaching jobs in their area.

Thanks, everyone for the congrats on Janice's incision healing. Unfortunately, the joy over that didn't last. Janice was at a scrapbook retreat on Friday night in Oxnard and fell in the parking lot of a restaurant. She hit her head on the side of her car and separated her shoulder. She was alone and somehow drove back to the hotel (Not a good idea). When she got there, two of the ladies at the retreat who are nurses said she should go to an ER right away. My cousin, who was also at the retreat, drove Janice back to Kaiser Hospital near us and they ran two CT scans and xrays of her shoulder. After four tries, the orthopedist on call was able to get her should back in. Unfortunately, the CT scan showed that there was a small amount of blood inside her skull and they were going to consult a neurological surgeon. He said to rerun the CT and see if there was more blood. There wasn't, so they decided surgery may not be necessary, but they admitted her to ICU. They re-ran the CT last night and saw that the blood was diminishing, so they said she was ok to come home. I'm going to stay home from work the next few days and keep an eye on her. She's pretty tired and wobbly. Anyway, just when we thought we were done....",

She pulled into a McDonald's and could not remember the name of her hotel so she asked someone behind the counter where the hotel near the harbor is. They gave her directions, but did not ask her what happened or if she needed help. Just sent her on her way. :(",

I don't know if you remember me mentioning the lady radio host (Jillian) here that is going through treatment right now. Per her Twitter feed, she is doing well. She has stage 2, but they ran a CT and everything was fine. They saw one nodule on her lung, so they ran a PET scan and determined it was not malignant, which was great news. She was really having a hard time with Taxol. They were double-dosing her so she could be done and get to radiation before her kids get out of school for the summer. The double dose was just too much, so they cut it down to a single dose each session. I don't know how she is able to work as regularly as she does. She goes on the air at 5:00 AM and lives many miles from the station. You ladies (my wife and Jillian included, are all my heroes! ",

Unfortunately, my wife has had both. When she had acute leukemia 16 years ago, the chemo was strong and was designed to take her immune system and her counts down as low as they could go. Because she was so neutropenic, she would have to be infused in the hospital and stay there until her counts rose to safe levels before she could go home. She had three rounds and then a stem cell transplant after the 4th round. She pretty much was in the hospital for six months straight. The doctors feel that because her bone marrow took such a beating at that time, she had a very rough time with her four rounds of CT for breast cancer this past summer. I see on your bio info that you had much the same diagnosis. This was my wife's 2nd go-round with breast cancer. She had a lumpectomy 22 years ago. She is also Stage IIA and ER+, HER 2-.",

If you don't have any of that, it's probably residual pain, but it is something to mention to the doctors and ask them to check it out. Please do so because my wife developed an abscess on her mastectomy site after her first TC infusion. It doesn't sound like you have an infection, but please ask the doctors to check it. My wife is scheduled for her 2nd infusion tomorrow, but the incision is still draining slightly. This has caused two delays to the second induction so far. She is calling her surgeon to day to see if he thinks we should go ahead or postpone again. God bless you.",

I am sure not having the breast will take a lot of getting used to on her part. She's always had such a great attitude with the first two battles, I pray this will be the same, though all she lost the first two times was her hair (It never came back very well after the AML). This is going to be more of a change than the lumpectomy. I hope she does ok with it.. I am so glad I found this site. I wish you all the best.",
