Will the shots for the blue dye hurt? How are they done? If all goes well and I only have to have radiation after this, has anyone had the MammoSite radiation? Do you think my breast could survive 2 surgeries and then a procedure to insert the MammoSite catheter? Thanks for your help. Margaret  Log in to post a reply",
