At that time my breast surgeon recommended 6 month followups and did not mention tamoxifen. I did not get another mammo til 2008. The micro calcs no longer showed up in that breast, and the tests so far have been clean. I had an ultrasound and a MRI. I am having issues now with the other breast and when I met with my new breast surgeon she asked about tamoxifen. We did not really discuss it in much detail, but I am sure I will be discussing it with her during my next appt. I think the decision whether to take tamoxifen is an individual one. I am still in the deciding mode, but probally wont be taking it, cause I am a smoker and have a risk of blood clots etc. I think it is a good idea to get hooked up with a breast specialist. I feel better being monitored by a team that knows there stuff so to speak.",

You will want to take your films (mammo and ultrasound) with you so they can look at them. I wish I could help your panic lessen. I know I was so scared when they called me back for more views and an ultrasound the first time. For me it was helpful to see the images with the doctor or radiologist, and have them explained to me. If you think that might help ask to view the images with the doctor at the breast center. I have had cysts for many years and now when I see one on ultrasound I sigh a huge sigh of relief. My cysts are all over my breasts and ebb and flow. Some are quite large and painful. If it is a simple cyst, they are seeing then I would push for having it drained (aspirated). I have had this done a few times. They can send that fluid off to be tested too. It relieved the discomfort and pain of the cyst. Hugs Cleo",

I went for my MRI today and they said I cannot get one until they ck to see what type of middle ear prosthetic was used in my ear surgery in 2000. Swell I had the surgery in another city. I had some records from my doctor sent to a new ear doctor here in 2006, but I am not sure the make/model of the middle ear prosthetic is out there available in medical record land. I have had enough of the not sure and waiting game. The ear doctor I saw in 2000 is no longer alive and not all of his records are available. I have been very proactive with all this stuff and have a call into the hospital where it was done, and they have to find the surgery records and see if the info is there, and then fax it to my breast surgeon. I may be lucky and have the kind of prosthetic device in my new ear doctor's file.If this is the case I will know tomorrow afternoon sometime. I doubt it. UGH! I just want all of this to be done with!! I dont know if I want to go through all of this every 6months/year. The stress and anxiety will more likely cause cancer than not getting all these freakin tests. Thanks for listening, Cleo Log in to post a reply",

Talk about being a bit over the top proactive. I figured out that the device was spelled wrong and searched the internet for 2 1/2 hours and found the prosthetic and the material it was made of. Looks like it is perfectly safe for an MRI. I am taking my info in to the radiology dept on Mon. Ah what a relief.",

I dont like the idea of having a clip inside of my breast. Any one else feel wierd about this? I am going to pay more attention to my health and try some things to promote breast health.

I somehow relate to some of you here. Don't quite understand the reason. Probablly doesn't matter, but I always am analyizing myself. A character flaw?  Yes too much thinking. Maybe this should be posted on the I Bitch and Moan Anyway thread, but I decided to post here. Does anyone just get fed up with DEATH and the concept of human or living organism mortality? I don't know if this is some lesson from the universe that I am supposed to learn right now in my life, but I am not dealing very healthily(made up word) with it right now. I have this terrible anxiety about death...anyone I am close too, any creature I am close too, this planet....yadda yadda. I don't know how to get to a place of semi-peaceful acceptance of mortality. Today I hit the stress max....well I decided it was the stress max..and got some beer. I haven't tied one on for six months and hearing the news that my basketball coach from jr high and high school just recently died sent me directly to the beer isle. Not good to do, cause I am on a mission to get smashed today. The visitation is tomorrow at the same funeral home in my small hometown where I last attended my Mom's funeral (BC related death in 2004). Has anyone here gotten drunk cause they felt they just needed to escape for a day or two? Geesh I feel shame in asking such a question. I feel... Well isn't that a loaded partial sentence.",

A very slow slow taper might be good if you want to try going off of the medicine. It's really tough to get off them. And it changes our brain chemistry so much.",
