I have a few questions for everyone - how are you managing sleep, and does anyone else feel like they have a singe around their lower part of chest. It feels so tight and uncomfortable. I have read a lot of people are still taking pain meds but I find all they do is knock me out so I've Brenners using Tylenol. Maybe that is why I feel so much discomfort? Also how is everyone's range of motion ? I can't lift my arms very well at this point. I also am experiencing more pain in the arm without the lymph nodes out bc I think They must have hit a nerve. I am very happy to have found a place where people are going through this that can help me feel better about this journey and hopefully i can help someone else",

Yogadedra - the recliner is still my best friend most nights I end up in it! I was also very Naucious at first. I ate very bland the first few days until my appetite came back and now I am fine with everything. What are everyone's restrictions in terms of movement and weight. I just got a prescription for OT and PT but am having a bit of a problem getting in soon to be evaluated. I have those apts the end of the first week of November. The oncologist did tell me I need to wear a sleeve when I travel and I am restricted to 5 lbs first four weeks and 10 pounds second four weeks of lifting, pulling, pushing. I am also restricted to drive now (first two weeks). Anyone else",

For those who had bmx with direct implant, or even without, do you feel like there is a vice or tightness around your chest? That is what is so uncomfortable to me! Well that and trying to sleep. I'm just going with the motto at this point that it's day by day. I still do not know my course of treatment went to the oncologist yesterday (9 days post op) and pathology was not back! So I wait... Has anyone started there next steps in their journey",
