My liver panel is still not OK, so they lowered my dose of T - happy about it, because my body has been screaming for help all over the past three weeks. On the bright side, my cancer markers are on normal levels... they alway were but I forgot to ask on my first visit. This is certainly good news! Drim Hug you back. Congrats on your hair - mine is starting to grow in, so now I look like a baby, some fuzz and no eyebrows and lashes LOL. My parents like to stroke me on my head like I when I was a child :-). Tess For now I'm on high - steroids + the good news I got. I'll try to keep the good mood for as long as I can :-). Sorry to hear about your Mum's attitude...mine made it her strategy to convince herself that there was a mistake somewhere and that they're giving me the treatment \"just in case\". Says it keeps her from going insane. Needless to say she cried yesterday when I told her about my results (my Dad had to go out for a walk to digest it). It just breaks my heart to see them both suffer in silence for me, so I'm trying to do my best so that we all survive this with as little damage as possible. Jersey Good luck with your Mum and your family arrangements. I'm glad she shows a sense of humour - that's always goog :-). I'm sure your son will understand - I suppose he'll be glad to be home, I'd be happy to sleep on the sofa if I were in his place! Patricia You're probable on your way now, so just \"bon voyage\". Don't worry too much about the terrorist attacks... on the other hand they're planning a public transport strike for next week, so I guess you'll have plenty of chance to use your walking training :-). Jenn Oh the innocence of children, I don't wonder you started crying - your little guy made my eyes wet too! So sorry about your friend, but it seems more and more of pregnant/post-partum women get breast cancer. My onc told me about this on one of my visits when I told her I wondered if I hadn't got cancer because I was still childless at 33... she seemed genuinely clueless...Try to help your friend as much as you can, she'll need every support she can get! On the headache issue, I've no idea. I know they want to check everything, but don't worry, you're probably just tired and stressed out from all this! Paxton I agree, we're survivors to life, aren't we. As the saying goes here: \"Life is a fight and those who die are cowards\"! Once I thought it was a funny line, not any more! GolferGirl Great to read about your nathuropath. I'm seing an accupuncturist/homeopath right now and she said we'll start a detox after I'm done with chemo. Moodiness comes from chemo/menopause and from what we've been through. Hang in there, this shall pass! Denise Hope that on loosing weight you'll loose your chin too :-). And I have those when-will-it-end feelings now and then too. We need to be strong! Taxotere has drained me out this last time too, so I'll see if the lowered dose helps. The kind of tats you got for your birthday are probably not what you wanted, but as Barb said, you can have some more fun ones later :-). Leanna Oh those parents... just stay patient, I guess your Mum just wants to help but she doesn't know how to go about... And yes, hot flashes wake me up all the time. I also get breathless even if I sit still... I guess it's chemo combined with my induced menopause, but it sucks, I totally agree with that!  Barb I won't be on tamoxifen, so I can't help really, but I know that some women have no SE's at all, you might be one of them! Hugs to all of you and prayers for happy endings for all of us!",

The conversation IS getting lively lately - seems like we're all getting better and better and we're getting to fully enjoy a good chat :-). So, I went in for my pre-surgery mammogram and sonography. There is a tiny little spot on the mammo, but during the ultrasound, the doc kept looking, and looking, and looking, and couldn't see ANYTHING! Meeting my surgeon tomorrow to see what my surgery will be. Boy, I can't seem to take all this good news in. I'm counting my blessings! Drim Will search your segment on GMA out - I hope I'll be able to see it here. I wish there were cold caps here, but nobody seems to have heard about them... I'll try to spread the word by myself! Denise I feel the same - getting better and better and wondering how I could stand all the fatigue and SE's from chemo... I sometimes itch and was wondering if it is growin hair, but isn't... Maybe it's dry skin from chemo. Daiva I'd say that an onc/gyn would be necessary if you really had cancer on your ovaries, but in your case a good \"ordinary\" surgeon should do. Anyhow, look for several opinions before you cut (if I may say so). Jersey YAY for new hair! Mine is still scarce, but growing (I look like a baldish David Beckham with more growth on top that stands and wont lay down :-) ). Good luck with your recon! Jenn Good luck with your surgery, I'll find out about the date of mine tomorrow! Curious about how they'll proceed, it should just be a lumpectomy, so maybe just local anesthesis...? Leanna YAY for running upstairs :-)! I still can't though my legs hurt a little less and I had relatively little cramps today. Day Great hair indeed! A friend of mine who went through this actually told me that will grow in thick and curly, but I didn't think it could be soo thick :-)! Barb Great to hear it's not chicken pox! Truth is we don't need anymore trouble now... maybe it's just a lingering allergy to chemo that will gradually fade away. Have you considered some kind of detox? I agree with Day, propolis helps a lot of things so you might give it a try (healed many an UTI with me and helps boost the immune system). Packjen Your little girls are so cute :-)! And this is a nice ad! Everybody have a great day (though it's already night here)! Hugs!",

Bone marrow biopsy is for a clinical trial in my case, I was hesitating a little because as Day said, it looked like a bit overkill. But my onc said it was OK to go ahead with it,  that it probably would be negative with me, and that they considered it to be a part of the usual staging process. So I guess I'll help the science to move on :-). Denise YAY for beating your rads tech :-). My fatigue is fading away every day, but I still avoid greater effort, thought I guess it wouldn't be bad to get a little in shape before the surgery. Oh and don't your relatives predict good things too? I usually don't believe that stuff, but it felt kind of pleasant to have someone tell me all will be fine (I prefer to turn to my church though for this kind of things ;-) ).

We brought some fun stuff for the general public - showed people how to calculate the speed of light using slices of bread, margarine and a microwave oven or took their DNA samples for instance. We stayed from 7 am until midnight and were surprised how many people came visiting. The library had a very nice program - apart from universities and us presenting themselves there was a concert of the Academic orchestra, exhibitions and a tea room.

Hope your LE will go away too - yes, hot weather is of no help right now. I don't have it as yet, but my breast and my armpit is sometimes a little swollen, so I'm curious about what will come up next.

As for hair, mine is curlier that ever - the trim I had a month ago made me looked a little more pulled together for a while, but not long.

One of my colleagues also surprised me like that, although we were in touch more than you and your coworker - when I told her about my dx she almost cried, then hugged me and told me she considered me one of her good friends. I was so touched, because we weren't really close like that before! She even invited me to her wedding, though I won't be able to go - it's this Saturday and my Neulasta shot will likely start kicking in, so I want to avoid hurting away from home. Sorry to hear about your uncles though, but as I told Leanna, these things happen, people sometimes just don't know how to react.... Patricia You're definitely right about doing what we really want to do, not what others tell us. These hard times have taught me not to worry about unnecessary things and to reconsider my life. I'll keep my profession and my workplace, but I'll be more relaxed about my relationship to work! Best to all of you!",

I went to a cardiology check-up yesterday, my heart is working 100% but my pulse was 121 bpm after I climbed I flight of stairs to the first floor...  Truth is I'm breathless all the time. The doc said it might be my thyroid so he took yet another blood draw and I'll see next Monday. He said my worsened liver panel might be a consequence to that. Anyhow, with my heart being healthy as it is, he sees it as a minor complication, so I'll gladly believe him :-). Drim/Ditah There's quite a lot of Ditahs in my country as well - in between the two WWs there was a strong Israeli community and the old Jewish Quarter has been getting lively and cheerful these past 20 years again :-). Daiva Oooh, how I'm looking forward to walking again. My legs are achy and swolen now and when I try to walk a little briskier I get cramps. But this will soon pass, I can see light at the end of the tunnel :-) . Jenn You're finally done with chemo, woohoo!!! I'm glad you could enjoy Thanksgiving in spite of all your problems. I hear you on your fatigue - I feel I'll need plenty of rest before my surgery too! I'll be thinking of you on Nov 10!  Leanna  Will say a prayer for you tomorrow! Denise Funny how one keeps bumping into people with similar experience. Before my dx I hardly new anyone with BC, now I know so many women who share what I'm going through... No idea if the stats are increasing, but to me it seems that there are more and more cases... Hope your experience will help the newsmans wife! Jen There's no such commercial here, so I can't say. Instead I got angry at a singer who has recently had BC and who put up a campaign with her bald photo saying \"Want to end up like me? Skip your prevention check-ups!\" As if hair loss was all there was to BC... and I didn't skip anything, there's just no screening for younger women!  BTW she's under 40 too, so WTH... Am I too sensitive or am I right to think she's not being fair to the rest of us? Hugs to all you guys!",

In this regard I was reassured by the cardiologist who does my check-ups - when I went there for the first time, he told me that anthracyclins (the A in AC) might damage the heart, but that the probability was low. However, the tx was so successful now that the patients live longer and healthier lives than before, that they simply had to watch them to see if there isn't any long-term damage.

I don't have TE's, segmentoctomy means the BS took only a small portion of tissue around the original tumour (I had a clip put in so they could find the place). The breast looks great, only a little smaller than before, but then I was uneven before the surgery, so no problem. He moved around some muscle tissue so that the shape was conserved, so I might as well had PS ;-).And yes, I have three brand new sisters and hopefully friends for a longer time than our stay in hospital. Jenn YAY for clear margins! I'll find out about the outcome of my surgery next week, I just hope I won't need to go in for another one... BS is a nice guy, but I prefer to stop seeing him :-).

The margins are very narrow though, (1-2mm and the ideal is 5mm), the tumour didn't disappear completely, but split into four tiny pieces, but the BS said he wouldn't want to re-operate and left the decision to my onc. She wanted to consult first, so talked to him yesterday and was getting ready to consult with other oncs today. So I'll know on Monday what comes next. Ugh... Re-operation is full mastectomy and I don't want it... Funny how a good outcome may go sour so quickly...

As for stupid comments, I heard one the other day too - we were having a Christmas party at work and I was talking to my colleagues about my surgery (sharing funny stories about waking up from anesthesis ;-) ) when a senior colleague asked what my disease has really been. I said I had felt a lump in my breast that turned out to be nasty and he asked: \"so you had no one to feel you up?\" OK, he was a bit drunk, but isn't this gross? Argh! Barb O Holy Night had me crying even before BC, so don't consider it a problem. Let your emotions go. Leanna Good luck with your Mum. Be patient with her, Mum's are just trying to do their best, although it doesn't always seem like that. As for tamox, I started it today, so I'm curious about how it will go.

Hope your PET scan didn't show anything suspicious! Leanna Love your \"bratitude\" LOL! I'll be happy to go braless too, I had always been uneven prior to my surgery, so going braless was a no-no for me. Hopefully rads won't change the shape of my operated boob :-).

I felt very tense ever since my surgery, but I'm probably getting more relaxed now and feel like I could do with a decent holiday. No luck though, I'm starting rads next week, but I hope to be able to get away after that. Like many of you, I so want to be rid of this BC stuff!  On a happier note, as much as I feel unsure about my work, I was able to help a colleague with a thermodynamic problem - it was easy, but it didn't seem that way to him, so I sort of looked like a genius, that made me feel great :-). Big hug to everyone!",

I'm glad you enjoyed your trip to Cambodia, that must have been fascinating! Did you make some photos? Drim Good luck with your refurbs, hope they go on smoothly. And enjoy your time off :-).

As for surgery, I'll have it at soonest three weeks after the last round of chemo, but am not sure what is the longest waiting time - I still am to meet my surgeon. Wellsey, thanks for sharing the funnies thread, I might have some ideas to add into it :-). I hope you'll ride your last chemo bull gracefully ;-). Patricia I was born and live in Prague, capital of Czechia. A lovely historic city, so if any of you ladies plan a getaway to Europe and my hometown, just PM me, I'll be glad to help! As for me, I'm still hesitating where to go - it'll depend on if I have rads or no. If no, I might go somewhere south in December - Tunisia or Egypt, I missed this summer holiday (I usually go to our countryhouse to escape the city but it has no heating, so a winter stay there is out, although I'd love to spend Christmas there...). Tess where in Ireland are you going to? I went to Dublin two years ago on business and enjoyed every minute of it! Did anybody have cold hands and feet after Taxotere? The tingling stopped but I find it hard to keep my feet warm at moments... this bugs me as the weather is going to get cooler now... (((Hugs))) to everyone!",

Packjen - YAY for Hawaii, enjoy yourself! I'm not sure tamoxifen replaces birth control though - you'd better be careful there ;-). I'll ask my onc next week if the biopsy is really necessary. Basically it should be from the breast bone and a smaller sample than with marrow donation, but I'm still reluctant. My Mum had it about fifteen years ago (negative, thank heaven), but I know she said it was very unpleasant. Patricia - you're right about listening to one's body as to excercise.

I guess you'd have to eat tons of tofu every day to make your cancer worse or to cause it. My onc told me one should just not take artificial phytoestrogens, like those \"natural\" remedies against hot flushes.

I actually don't mind waiting for my rads, I'll be more than happy to get a break from everything. In the meantime I'm taking tamox and getting Zoladex shots, so my treatment goes on :-). Hugs to all!",

Does any of you have a similar experience? I'm seing my onc this Thursday, but I'd like to hear from someone other than a doctor too. I'm so happy for each and everyone of you who are getting good news and staying positive. I do hope I'll be too soon - I just don't recognize myself lately. Big hug to all of you Magda",

I don't think I look nearly as good in life as on the photos, so now I'll really have to make sure everything about me is better than perfect LOL! Reiki sounds like a great idea, I might try and find out about it in my neighbourhood. Denise Glad you enjoyed the concert in spite of the discomfort! I didn't realize there was someone aberrant in your daughter's pic though - the pair took all my attention, so don't worry about the baldie ;-). Barb I just can't imagine what you're going through! I pray it's just overkill care and they tell you it's benign!!! Paxton  YAY for feeling good :-)! sharalou In my experience, Lipobase cream is best for chapped hands - helped me at least. Leanna I hear you on how you felt on watching those movies. I incidentally started watching a movie with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman in which they find themselves in hospital, because they both have cancer. I just couldn't stand watching Nicholson with his IV in and sick... Day Never mind about Daiva's mistake, hey, we're in Europe after all ;-). Big hug to all of you!",

I'm finding out I enjoy eating more than anytime before, but what the heck, I'd rather be fat and happy than thin and frustrated! Praying for a good result for you too! Denise Thanks for the compliment, as I said in my previous post, I was having the time of my life during that event, so that probably shows in the pics :-).

Sending a big warm hug to you and lots of prayers again and again. Otherwise it seems I'm bad at keeping up with your posts - partly, as I had said already, because I wanted to move on (I needed some time of not reading and talking about BC) a bit and partly due to lots of work which I'm grateful for. But I will pop in and out to see how you all are doing. Day what great hair. I'm going to the hairdresser's on Tuesday and am curious about the outcome. My curls are difficult to tame so I want to look a little more pulled together, even though originally I didn't want a cut at all too. Patricia This is a hard time for us all and I'm sorry to hear about your breakup. I'm sometimes grateful for being single and childless, as this dx is probably harder on our nearest and dearest than on us (or differently hard, we're fighting, they're just helpless onlookers). I guess you should have your lump checked and possibly removed, just do everything you can. GG Sorry about your friend, I hope she'll get all the help and treatment available! Ditah Yeah, what a year. I had my \"cancerversary\" on May 5 when I had my biopsy and was lucky I spent in on a lecture symposium, although it was on antiviral and antiproliferative drugs, so kind of medical too. Denise I'm having my markers checked in a month and going for a mammo on May 23 and trying to act cool about it for now. After Jenn's posts... I don't know... Summer Hope your blood tests went uneventful! And sorry about your friend, there's too much of it simply! Leanna Will let you know about how my hair looks on Tuesday, maybe I'll get some tips from the hairdresser to share. Jersey Hope you'll be healing quickly from your hip surgery! Are we allowed to straighten our hair so soon? Even if it's with keratine? I've read it somewhere you'd better keep of these things for 6 mos to 1 year after chemo, but YAY for bangs, I want some too LOL! And my hat off to your son!

Leanna9: Nice to meet you, though I'd have preferred better circumstances. It seems it's not unusual to have BC at my age, there are reportedly younger women, some even during their pregnancies or right after... (and I thought I got it because I'm childless!). I'm on Taxotere, they give me premed IV with steroids and degan (the other is for stomach upsets) and I take steroids on the day after. I'll see with my onc next time if we can do anything about it; they are reluctant to prescribe steroids in this part of the world due to possible fluid retention, but my onc is a great woman who is willing to do her best, so that I can finish my treatment as scheduled. Anyway, I have three more T chemos to go, the next one is on Sep. 15 and the last one should be on Oct 27, if everything goes along the plan that is. I'll hang on in here and keep you posted on my progress! I had to go in today, because I still have UTI symptoms and symptoms of a mild cold (went to a social event on Saturday, it was cold outside and the hotel was air-conditioned...), but my regular onc is on holiday, so there was another one to help me and I couldn't really discuss my SE's. She found a mild infection and a deficiency od vit. B and protein (no wonder, I have no taste buds now, so I barely eat). I'm on ciproflaxin for now and have been given nizoral for mouth sores. But, as you say, it's great to see the tumor responding (from 23mm x 19mm to 12mm x 9mm after four rounds of AC)  (((Hugs))) to all of you!",

So I had some with my meals during my AC therapy when I wasn't sick and it didn't hurt me at all. I'm not having any since my first T therapy, partly because I couldn't taste anything until two or three days ago, but mostly because I'm taking antibiotics for infection right now, but I guess that once I'm done with them, I'll give it a go before I loose my taste again. Sacphotomom - I've heard of the marijuana thing too, a friend of a friend of mine actually smoked pot when she was sick and it seemed to helped her... I'm not a smoker though, so that wouldn't have been an option for me... And yes, eating your fave foods during chemo makes you hate them for a long time - I had loved apple pie until it ended down my toilet... As for neo-adjuvant vs. adjuvant chemo, I really prefer it to see my tumor shrinking - there might be more nodes involved, but that's the point of it, to have them cleaned prior to operation. And for me it will hopefully be only a lumpectomy (unless they find I'm BRCA positive, the results are not ready yet). I need to start planning a getaway for after my treatment too! Patricia, your trip to Paris sounds just great!!! Big hugs Magda",

I guess disappointment has a lot to do with my state of mind - after the AC chemos I would always bounce back once the nauseas were gone and then function normally until the next tx; I even felt very upbeat about my treatment and condition. Now I don't feel nauseated, but I do feel tired most of the time, so I probably just need to adjust to the new situation. Hot flushes from Zoladex and the occasional breathlessness from fluid retention (even at night time...) just make things worse... I'll see my accupuncturist on Tuesday and talk about it with my onc on Thursday to see if they can help. Tess You've put what I've been feeling into words so pertinently! You're very right about that BC will probably be a part of our lives forever. Even if we are declared cancer free in the end, there will always be follow-up check ups and a fear of recurrence. A colleague of mine says that I should see this as a momentary disbalance in my body that I am currently setting right and that after that I should see my body as healthy and  balanced and never look back... I wonder if this is possible! On the other hand I realized that going to my Professor's funeral helped me in a way - it was a very peaceful and dignified moment and I was glad to have attended it (if you can ever be glad to go to a funeral). Jen Great hair! Hold on, we all feel tired from all this - many factors combine as I can see for myself right now... As for had or have, I'm all for the past tense as soon as possible - we need to move on! Wellsey Thank you :-). I like the way you're such a fan of bullriding :-). And yes, one jump at a time! Daiva Thanks so much for your prayers. This is an emotional time for us all and being fatigued has always made me feel depressed, which in turn makes me angry against myself (for not coping as I originally wanted, for being such an emotional wreck.... you name it). This is a vicious circle I need and hope to break somehow :-). Enjoy Vegas, you deserve it! Patricia Thank you girlfriend! YAY for being done! This is a moment I'm looking forward to and fearing at the same time, but I guess I'd celebrate to :-). Keeping you all in my prayers!",

Here is my update: diagnosed on 5/11, started chemo on 5/27, had my second to last chemo last week on10/7 and should get the last one on 10/27. During this time my tumor has shrank from 23x19 mm to 9x4 mm and has changed its nature (looked like a ball on sonogram but now looks more like necrotic tissue) and the visible lymph node looks normal. Started Zoladex shots on third chemo and should be having them for two years. After my last chemo, appointment with my cancer team and surgeon. Rads depending on the surgery outcome, no idea if I'll be having Tamoxifen. I won't be able to react to each and every one of you - so good luck to all who are still in treatment and/or awaiting surgery, wishes of less pain and more energy. I feel tired too from Taxotere, even though they lowered my dose last time. Bowels are also a bit loose, but the end is in sight so I'm hanging on. Like Beth I'm going to go for naturopathy after I'm finished - to detox and get in shape and mostly prevent this idiotic disease coming back. Naturopathy might help with the mood swings too as I have been told. Best wishes, hugs and prayers to all you gals :-). Magda (Majdula)",

I'm also a happy-go-lucky kind most of the time and when I felt down during the first weeks of taking tamox, I was hoping that bad mood would go away on its own, I didn't want any more meds and anything that obscures the mind is a no-no for me. My onc shares this opinion (she literally said: \"YOU don't need that\"), so I'll just hope the flushes will gradually fade away (they already do a little, but I'm still clueless as to when they come and go and why, like you I wish there was a pattern, but some nights are just perfect, whereas I bathe in sweat on others... go figure).

I've read it in another thread that vit. B was good too - I'm taking it now for my mouth sores so I'll see if it helps with the tingling too.

Leanna: Hope your chemo went well, the Red Devil can cause havoc with your body, but hold on, I could do it and so do you! It wasn't until the fourth round that my onc found the right medication for me - Aloxi + corticosteroids (I couldn't bear Emend, it was causing me more SE's than it was supposed to prevent...). I was just a little queasy after that, could eat a little and as a result didn't feel so run down. I also went for an acupuncure session on the day before everytime, it helped me to deal with the heartburn and swallowing problems on the week after the chemo. Do you go to check-up sonographs or mammos to see if the chemos work? These check-ups were a great motivation for me, kept me going! My eye-brows are gradually filling in as do my lashes. I didn't loose all of them though, they were just sparser; I was using a l'Oreal serum on my lashes throughout the AC therapy and it seems to work, so I might suggest it as something worth trying.",

But you're a medical worker as I understand, so you know way more about it than I do. I do basic research in thermodynamics (mostly things related to solubility of different compounds, if they mix and how much) in a state research institute. Apart from that I teach postgrads and have a PhD student, although we're not a university - we collaborate with a chemical faculty in Prague and are allowed to have postgrad courses. I really like my work, because I was lucky to be in a lab that allows me to be my own boss to a certain extent :-). However, I tended to worry a lot about the outcome of my research and how it was accepted, which I'm hopefully not going to do anymore, it's not worth it!",

Sorry to hear about your healthcare system, I guess we're quite lucky over here, though we start paying for more and more things, but it's still far less than you do... njbhwgirl So sorry if I have offended you, I can imagine arthritis is horrible, I just thought it was better than bone mets ... me and my big mouth! I pray that you get better soon! Jenn and Daiva Ooooh, I can see now I am lucky. Truth is, I've always been clumsy, I've been hitting doors mostly, and this hasn't gotten worse yet. As for keeping track of things, I must write them down and this still remains the same too (cheers njbhwgirl :-) ). Daiva Meds do add-up in our bodies. What's more, once you're done, your brain is giving a signal \"it's over, you can relax\", so your entire body that has been behaving itself all that time finally lets go. Hopefully you'll be getting better and better. Patricia A baby grand piano? Wow! Enjoy it! Hugs and love to all of you, even those whom I don't know and don't post here anymore :-).",

I was wondering how I'd feel once I'm done and after the first emotional turmoil I really feel relieved. From now I consider myself healthy, even though there might be rads after my surgery too, but if all somes out clear I might avoid them. They told me I  had chemo before the surgery because there was a suspicion of lymph node involvement and this has also become standard for premenopausal women too. The purpose is to get to a breast-conserving surgery (unless I'm BRCA positive that is, about which I'll probably find on Friday). Denise Yeah, I am relieved! My tumour was a slower one - I was hesitating about my lump for about three months and it hardly grew in between, so I wasn't really worried ab out it in my body... though of course I didn't feel too happy neither!

So they're basically taking out only a small amout of tissue around the wire and some sentinel nodes, I genuinely hope that won't be the entire underarm sack. I'll ask my onc for more details next week. Lumpectomy should really be OK, I guess the surgeon just wanted to make sure I understood the risk of possible re-excision (and he wanted to look clever too, he's youngish, into his mid-thirties, just like me, and he looked like he wanted to impress me... at first I thought that was a little annoying, but then I was flattered that after all these chemos and in spite of that I have to make up more heavily to add some features to my face he thought I was attractive ;-) ).

I know it took me some time to keep you posted about my results, but I have checked out of hospital only yesterday. My drain was removing fluids like crazy and they didn't trust me to be able to \"milk\" it by myself (and no nurse would be visiting to do it). Anyway, everything went remarkably well so here is a little summary of what I went through. Thursday, December 2, check-in. Breast surgeon saw me along with three other women undergoing similar surgeries on the same day. We then all went for the radionuclide injection to mark suspicious lymph nodes and made friends quickly. BS then came to see us in our room (we were all four together) to make sure we were alright. He's quite fun actually and we all found we had a slight weakness for him :-). Friday, December 3, surgery. Segmentoctomy and axillary node dissection (so the full sack, contrary to what I've been thinking). I first went for the wire insertion to mark the path to the wire clip inside. After that off to the op-room where a very nice young lady anesthesiologist took care of me. I was concerned about being nauseated after waking up (with chemo SE's still fresh in my mind...), but she said they were using drugs that cause very little nausea. I went to sleep very quickly, I just remember someone saying good night and me replying good night and then I have foggy recolections of saying that I dreamt of something, but couldn't remember what the dream was. As I was waking up in the post-op room I kept asking questions about what went into my IV (glucose, rehydration solution and painkillers), then the anesthesiologist showed up to check that I was fully awake and told me I was very funny on waking up. I apparently kept giving answers to questions that weren't addressed to me, I was interfering in the docs and nurses conversations LOL. However, BS refused to tell me what I was babbling, said it was better that I didn't know :-). I only hope I didn't tell them anything that was embarrassing ;-). They took me to our room afterwards and I luckily threw up only once. Saturday, December 4 BS told me I would check out on Monday... and off he went on holiday... My drain then started giving so much fluid that his stand-in made it Tuesday first, then Wednesday when he was planning to remove it. I checked out on Wednesday, but with my drain still attached. It still gives some fluid, but less and less and I will see my original BS tomorrow about its removal. Histology report is not ready yet, so I'm still waiting to see if I got clear margins and what is Girls, in less than a week I saw more than in one human life. Not only I have learned so many things about breast surgery, but I was in an ob/gyn department of the hospital (no vacancy in the onco dept and the hospital is basically specialised in womens diseases), so I saw had one after another two ladies with hypermenorrhoea, two premature mothers (we baptised one of the babies on Monday and I'm now a godmother to little Claudia), one extra-uterine pregnancy that needed to be terminated (a very sad one, the girl aborted spontaneously six months ago) and one spontaneous abortion. It's been like an onco-gyn internship! I was also surprised at my reaction to everything - I actually managed to get interested in everything that was going on around me. The three ladies that were operated with me were good company and we laughed everything off, our room got quickly known at the department as \"the cheerful room\". The \"girls\" did not undergo any oncological treatment, so we exchanged phone numbers and I'll be happy to help them with any kind of problems that lay ahead of them. Now on to each and everyone of you: Jen: Such great hair! Mine is growing in quickly, as well as my lashes and eyebrows, they're much thicker than before my surgery - woohoo :-). Paxton: I know what it means to chase out rats from the house - we have plenty of them at your country house. Great to hear the problem seems solved. Patricia: Gray is great, it looks noble and distinguished. My Mum has great gray hair and looks fantastic :-). As for the snake we had one in our country house twice, but it was just a small grass snake that went away on its own once and that I caught into a plastic bag and let out the second time. Never ever kill a snake in your house, brings bad luck and snakes are believed to be guardians of the house they visit. Daiva: Good luck with your TE's and DIEP. There was a moment on Saturday when I was thinking \"enough, I've had enough!\" and I guess you have the same feelings sometimes. Keeping you in my prayers! Denise: I'm back to stay, I'm convinced that there are clear margins and that there won't be any more surgery! YAY for your appointment in three months time, that's so great! I also hope your skin is healing quickly. When is your recon? Kim: Who is Edwards? Is she the wife of John Edwards? I heard she had cancer that wasn't curable but treatable... so bad to hear she was unable to go on with hear treatment! Phew, it feels good to be back. Sorry for this long post, but I'm had to get this all out, this WAS great experience! Hugs to all of you, I'm keeping you in my thoughts and prayers :-).",

My hair is so \"long\" now that my wig slips away if I pull a little harder, so I need to be careful now in public. I complained about this in front of the surgeon who saw me today and realized only too late that he was a baldie (that was when he replied: \"At least it's growing back\"... poor guy, he is so nice and quite young, in his mid-thirties, but then he didn't see his hair coming off in handfuls).

BS drained my seroma on Thursday, so I'll see if it forms again.  I hope your infection heals soon, so that you can get to rads and be done with them as soon as possible. How many will you be doing?

We kick-started it last week with a press conference and a networking breakfast Woment Sharing a Chemical Moment in Time, which was in fact a panel debate of five notable women scientists that I hosted. A colleague of mine made some awesome photos, so check them out if you want (I wear a black jacket and a black flower-printed scarf): http://hroch486.icpf.cas.cz/rokchemie/snidane/ . We had some modest media coverage as well, mostly radios, but more importantly, both panellists and the public told me that they were enjoying themselves a lot, which was the best reward for me. This event was exactly what I needed to get me back on track, I had a lot of fun, even though it was hard work to prepare it. Leanna voted for you a couple of times and will again - I hope you win :-)! Daiva Enjoy your holiday, I crave sun and warmth! And I hear you on our physical shape - the other day I was on the subway and the escalator was out of order. It was one of the deepest subway stations in Prague and I felt like I was going to die when I got to the top... Time to get moving! Day I hope you'll be feeling better soon. Praying that your MRI shows just inflammation! Most importantly, that the pain goes away as soon as possible! Drim Good luck with your appt rennovation - this is the time to start everything afresh isn't it? I am thinking of moving house altogether! Beth Black cohosh for hot flushes sounds great, but I was unable to find it here :-(. So I guess I'll try homeopathy instead, hope it works. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you for the mammogram, funny how we stopped trusting our bodies. Wesley/Linda sent me a link to a very interesting article on this: http://www.cancercounselling.org.uk/northsouth/extra4.nsf/WebResClient/1761049276601BD68025735B00604834/$FILE/article3.pdf?openElement. Denise Don't be too afraid to go back to work, just do it. It has done me tons of good, and if I catch a cold, so be it! My toenails are growing back too and I keep my fingernails as short as possible, they were breaking in exactly same way as yours, but they're getting stronger. Try biotine, it's great for them! I hope you enjoyed your concert and left Brandy at home - I still don't go out wigless, but plan to do it soon (I just don't want people that don't know about my dx ask what happened to my hair as yet). As for being misdiagnosed, this is incredible, how many of you could have avoided this... OK, maybe we should try telling ourselves that hope is not thinking that things will turn out the best they can, hope is being convinced that everything that happens to us happens for a reason... I asked my onc about feeling down for some time after starting tamox. I said it felt weird - I was expecting to be happy about the worst part of the treatment behind me, and guess what she replied: \"It's not logical, it's hormonal.\" LOL! We just don't need to tell guys about that, otherwise they'll see it as a confirmation of what they already think about us. Sorry for such a long post and a big hug to everyone!",

Leanna, yes, I've read about the vaccine too - as soon as it's out I'm having it! I went in to schedule my rads today - my dry run is on March 8 and I start rads on March 10. I'll have 25 total + 8 boosts. They want to do brachytherapy for the boosts though - to put the radioactive source right into the breast, which requires a minor surgery, but is gentler to the skin, so I guess I'll go for it. Talked to my onc about it today and she okayed it too. On the other hand she said she wasn't so concerned about a local recurrence with me, she was concerned about possible distant one.... ugh... not a piece of info I really wanted to get :-/. I guess I'll just put it aside and let her worry instead of me :-). Hugs!",
