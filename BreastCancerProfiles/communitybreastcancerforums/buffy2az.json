I was diagnosed in Jan. and had my lumpectomy on 1/23.  I don't need chemo because the tumor was only 6 mm, but my PR was positive so I've started Tamoxifen as of 2/22. I don't know what to expect from Rads either, only what I've read the other women have experienced.  Let's start off together and see how things go.  I'm hoping for the best-case scenario. :-) Good luck!",

I go on Friday for my dry run.  Thanks, Frenchgal, for the explanation on that.  I think it will be nice to have them go through it all before actually doing the radiation so I know what to expect. One of the technicians told me that it was fine to use the aloe vera gel after treatments, that it wouldn't help with the redness, but would make it feel better.  Have to wait and see I guess. I'm fair skinned so I'm sure I'll get pretty red.  I'll get the rest of my questions answered on Friday. Buffy",

Could be why I haven't felt too well yesterday or today.",

I guess that \"dry run\" really did help. I went to work, then to treatment, then back to work. I'm feeling tired right now, but I'm sure that's a reaction to the anticipation of the unknown and getting through the first session. I'm thinking tomorrow should be better. I have been feeling a little sensation in my breast off and on - is it too soon for that? It's only been about 3 hours - maybe I'm just imagining it? It's different from the feeling of the nerves waking up. Pattis - how are you doing? Are you still taking Tamox? 1 down, 32 to go! Buffy",

I came through it all in pretty good form, able to work full-time and minimal burn to the skin thanks to Biafine. I'm fatigued, but I feel outside stress contributed to that. Looking forward to full energy again! Congrats to those who have finished and who are almost finished. I'll check in with the Tamoxifen folks once in a while now. The fun never seems to end! :-) Buffy",

I've also been doing my best to get 7 or 8 hours of sleep a night and that helps.  Doesn't keep me from getting tired later in the day, but I can go a lot longer. I've been using aloe vera gel immediately after my treatment, as soon as I get home I put it on again, then at night before bed I use the aquaphor.  I'm hoping it will help keep me from having too bad a case of burning and soreness. I went to Old Navy and found some cotton camisoles that I will start wearing. I used a cotton bra this first week, but I noticed some tightness from the swelling on Thurs. so it's time to switch over. When I got my tattoos, it was during my mapping session, and the whole thing took about an hour. The tattoos are like small dark freckles...barely noticeable. I'm being lazy today. Didn't feel too well yesterday and decided to take it a little easier today in preparation for tomorrow and the start of another week.  I see my rads doctor on Mondays and I want to ask him what the purpose of the x-ray they take once a week is.  I'm told they will take one every five days, but no one said what they look for.  Anyone know? Best wishes to everyone! Buffy",

I take it before bed because I wanted to reduce the risk of nausea - so far I've only had 3 or 4 mornings when I felt a little bit of nausea, but it went away quickly. I'm already dealing with the hot flashes off and on - trying to work my way into menopause - and I think the Tamoxifen is adding to them. I'm waking up 2 or 3 times in the night with them, and I've noticed them becoming more frequent during the day now. I've only been on it for 10 days, so I'm hoping there won't be any other s/e. Darah - thanks for the suggestions. I was wondering about getting an electric razor and whether it would cause irritation. As for the cream you used, is it messy? My doctor recommended aloe vera gel, but that can be a little messy. I'm planning to work through all this so I'm hoping to keep the fatigue at bay. I'm dealing with some of that already and trust it doesn't get any worse. Still not sure what I'll do about the bra situation. I have my mapping session tomorrow afternoon, so I'll post again after that. Here's to keeping a positive attitude! Buffy",

That's encouraging.  It does seem odd that a nurse couldn't answer your questions, especially since she works in that area. At least you got a couple of them answered. Abbey, I'm with you on wanting to get started!  I have everything done now and am ready to start tx on Monday. I'm armed with my aloe vera gel and Aquaphor. I went looking for cotton camisols today...no luck. Everything is nylon and I'm thinking that would not be as comfortable.  It was suggested to me by one of the therapists that I wear something like that rather than a bra to avoid irritation to the skin. I'll keep looking. I wouldn't think I'd need it right away. 6 1/2 weeks will go by fast, right? :-) Buffy",

For me, I'm sure it's just nerves like Shirlann said. Hang in there and hopefully this will pass for you soon! Buffy",
