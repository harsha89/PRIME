      "Content": "gramof4 wrote: Hi all. I was diagnosed two years ago with grade 3, stage IIB,triple negative BC, micromets to sentinel node, lumpectomy with clean margin, 2.5 cm. I had six rounds of FEC and then 12 weeky Taxol, followed by 35 rads.  PET scan showed something in left lung. Follow up CT scan of the chest shows 8 mm nodule left lung with smaller, vague nodules in both lungs.  Also sclerosis to T spine in three areas.   I should mention that I am a transcriptionist and work for the hospital,  and have read my own report.  Doctor hasn't called me yet with results.  What are your thoughts as to what may be next for me?  Biopsy of lung?  If so, how is that done?  And, what does sclerosis mean....is that mets?  Thanks so much in advance.  I haven't posted for a long long time but do come to this site and read the boards almost daily and am inspired by you all.  Hugs.
