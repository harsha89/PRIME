I have already had chemo so that won't change.  So it's either another surgery or rads on the nodes.  I'm just going to roll with the flow and do what I have to do.  My mom had chemo for a year when I was six and I don't even remember her doing anything different. She's amazing (and still alive).  I'm sure your kids will look at you and think the same thing someday.",
