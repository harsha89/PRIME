My FNA had cloudy yellow serous fluid, left the cyst 'partially resolved.' My diagnosis says: Benign reactive and proliferative ductal epithelial cells, as well as apocrine metaplastic cells, fair amount of reactive macrophages, and blood cell elements in background. Could anything have been missed?? I have NOT spoken to dr because he's on vacation, I obtained these from records. Do any of these other findings increase my risk or raise a flag for second opinion??
