Having a very hard time drinking water or any drink for that matter. Staying on top of my nausea pills, but would like to know what is the average time people take their nausea pills for. If I don't stay on top of them I'm afraid I will be sick because in the morning I always seem to be nauseous. Anyway I have 5 more treatments of TAC every three weeks so at least I have a couple of weeks of feeling good. If anyone out there can let me know about the nausea and for how long you took your meds I would really appreciate it.",
