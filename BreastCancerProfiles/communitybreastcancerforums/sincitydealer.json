This couldn't come at a worse time as I'm in the middle of a move myself.  We sold our house and have to be out by the end of August.  In fact it will be two moves because we have to wait for our tenants to move out of our rental property.  That means moving into a 2 bedroom apartment for about 5 months. How could this old geezer do this to my 83-year-old Mother?  Whatever happened to \"In sickness and in health\"?  This whole thing is making me sick to my stomach.  I'm sorry to be venting here.  I'm in tears as I type this.  I'm crying not for myself, but for her, and all that she has to go through.

Meanwhile, it looks like I might be the one having surgery.  Went to see my orthopedist, and he thinks I've torn the cartilage in my left knee.  He's scheduling me for an MRI.  It's all swollen. Knowing my Mom isn't going to have such major surgery (at least for now), is really a relief.  I was so afraid.  I pray she really is healing. Thanks for reading. Peggy Log in to post a reply",
