I am post-mastectomy, IDC (with widespread DCIS also), Stage IIb, Grade 2, 1 affected node, with an Oncotype score of 14, but some scary prognostic factors on the pathology report (lymph-vascular invasion, nuclear grade 3, extensive necrosis, Extensive Intraductal Component, etc.).  My tumor was small (1.1 cm), but actually my surgical oncologist was discouraged by this, saying that the fact that such a small early cancer had made it into the lymph system at all is a little disconcerting.   My dilemma is that I've now seen four medical oncologists, two of whom have recommended AC→T, and the other two of whom have recommended TC x 4.  My favorite doc among the bunch, who is totally amazing in terms of her thoroughness, attentiveness, expertise, attention to detail (especially regarding some other health/psychiatric issues I have), and just her all-around ability to form mutually respectful and personable doctor-patient relationships, is one who recommends TC x 4.  Since the beginning, I have felt a pull toward the more aggressive AC→T, but she feels that it would be overtreatment in my case, based on my low-risk oncotype score --and will only agree to TC x 4.  I talked with her about TC x 6, and while she agreed that it would be a wonderful solution to this dilemma, she said she can't do it because it's not yet approved by the NCCN for my type of cancer.  She said she was sorry, but she is bound by her practice rules to stay within NCCN Practice Guidelines.  Plus, she said I would run a very high risk of my insurance not covering those last two Tx's.    I'm wondering if anyone out there has faced this same dilemma, and how you made your decision.  I'm also wondering, for those of you who are doing TC x 6, how are you doing it?  Have you had trouble with insurance? How are doc's \"getting away with\" treating patients with a regimen that is not an approved treatment?

Although I sometimes think that for people who don't have rare or hard to treat cancers and aren't interested in clinical trials, the high-ranking, research-focused, cancer centers can be a little over-emphasized. Despite having some tough decisions to make along the way, and conflicting recommendations, I have been very impressed by the quality of care I have received in the community-based hospital where I have received my Tx so far.  Now I'm just ready for the Tx's to start.  Was supposed to be this week, but has been postponed for Monday.  (Because of other health issues, Doc A had to talk to Doc B about medication complications/contraindications, but Doc B has been on vacation.  Yawn!)  I'm six weeks post second surgery, and three months post Dx, and still waiting for my first infusion.  I'm ready for that emotional flip to be switched from, \"there's all this research to do, tests to have, results to wait for, time to heal, and hard decisions to make, etc.\" to \"ok, this may not be how I want to spend my time, and this may be hard, but at least I know that now I am actively fighting this disease.\"  Ya' know?",

I take notes, or record our appt.'s; I get copies of all my test results, including images; I get second or third opinions; I bring in my own research to ask about.  It's not that I want to be a pain in the butt, or that I think they're going to make mistakes.  It's more a matter of how I deal with things and needing to know that everything is being considered.  It is just part of who I am to want to know and understand everything I can about things.  I'm a research junkie, and I like learning about new things, especially when they have to do with my health or the health of someone I care about.   There's no way I could be told I have breast cancer and NOT go out and read every reputable book I can get my hands on about -- in part because it is fascinating, and I want to know more about it, and in part because I need to know enough and get enough feedback from my doctors to feel confident that I (and they) are making the best possible decisions.  If that's a character flaw, then so be it, but I don't think it is.  I am always respectful to my doctors (except for two along the way who treated me like I was in the second grade).  I talk to them with the appropriate amount of humility that being a lay person requires.  I don't go in and say, \"This is what I want to happen...\" I say, \"I've read about such-and-such. What's your opinion of that?\" I'm kind and I pay attention. I don't believe medicine should be a consumer-driven industry. By that I mean that I don't think patients should assume that because they've read Dr. Susan's Breast Book, that they are experts on breast cancer and know better than their doctors, or that because they saw an ad for Fosamax they should march into their doc's office expecting him/her to give it to them (our Canadian friends might point out here that it is illegal in Canada for pharmaceutical companies to advertise their products).  I believe medicine is as much art as it is science, and we need to begin from a place of trust with our doctors, and I do not presume to have the expertise that comes from their years of experience in treating patients with these drugs/tests whatever and seeing how things worked out, etc. But I do believe that our relationships with our doctors ought to be partnerships in which both parties bring equally important things to the table, in which both parties are responsible for their own and each other's education.  Patients, I think, in this time of easily accessible information, should do all that they can to educate themselves, so that they can take what they understand, combined with what they possess in the way of values, needs, their own goals for their health and well being (because these goals may not be the same as their doctors' goals), and what they understand about their own body (i.e. how it reacts to medication, stress, trauma, healing, etc.).  Patients are responsible for these things, and doctors should be responsible to their patients to listen respectfully to these elements of their patients' lives and do their best to incorporate them into the overall care plan.  Okay, so I went on a little rant there, and got way off track, but something struck a nerve. I will add one more thing though.  In my experience so far, almost all of the doctors I have seen, for this and for the other medical issues I've dealt with, doctors these days tend to appreciate it when their patients are educated and ask insightful and helpful questions or offer suggestions.  Most of my doctors have respect for this partnership model of practicing medicine.  Actually, all of them do, because if I see one who doesn't, s/he doesn't stay my doctor. Anyway, lisaattheshore, I bet the staff there doesn't hate you or don't feel pestered by you.  I bet they respect your intelligence and your thoroughness in handling your own \"case.\"  And I bet if anyone at that office got sick, they'd handle it the same way.  And if I'm wrong, then you just go on doin what you're doin anyway! Okay, I'm done.  I'll let everyone rest now.  :) ",

I tend to get more nauseous in the evenings.  Sometimes, though, I'll go for a day or two with no nausea at all, and then the next day WHAMMO! I still try to avoid taking meds for it though because I have had such a huge problem with constipation. youngmom: I really applaud you for making the decision of discontinue chemo.  Most of us are doing it because we feel it is the best (or only) choice we have to beat the cancer, but your circumstances are different.  It has probably not been an easy decision to make.  It's so easy to get stuck in the one-way rut of thinking \"I have to do chemo. I have no choice.\" But you sat down and thoughtfully looked at your overall experience and options and allowed yourself to make a different choice. So good for you.  Al the same, I will be interested to know how your onc responds. Rachel: Great news on the bone scan! I'm so happy for you. Lizzy: I've actually been a little wary of your moniker, fearless leader. You may be the glue that holds this group together, but that doesn't mean that you don't need to come unglued from time to time.  You are optimistic in the face of your CA; you focus on positive thinking; you have realized how good it is for you (as it is for anyone) to be supportive and encouraging to others. But fearless? Maybe that's setting the bar a little high at the cost of exploring your own emotional turmoil and allowing yourself to be cared for, which you need every bit as much as the rest of us.  I get the strong impression that it is not easy for you to open up and let others in when it comes to your own vulnerabilities (I'm am quite intimately familiar with this issue myself), so I nominate YOU for the next cape, not just for having to deal with all these stalls and waits, and worries over your scans, but also for allowing yourself to shed the fearless leader personae and share with us the painful, rightening parts of your situation as well. A few things on me... I went running this morning, but could go only about a mile before I was sidelined by these darn muscle spasms in my back.  My onc said they are caused by the taxotere, but I keep expecting them to get better as the days go by.  But this time, they're not going away.  The feel like knife blades.  Is anyone else having this? And I was also wondering if anyone knows about any particular vitamin deficiency which could be causing or exasperating  them too? Thanks.  I'd appreciate any wisdom that comes my way. I keep meaning to make these book recommendations to you all.  Both by the same author, both uplifting in an \"I'm gonna kick cancer's butt\" kind of way, funny, and compelling. The earlier one (and the one I liked better out of the two) is Crazy Sexy Cancer Tips, and the second is Crazy Sexy Cancer Survivor.  The author is Kris Carr.  I highly recommend taking a look at either/both of these books. Hope everyone is enjoying their weekends.  We have suddenly received some rather chilly weather in the Chicagoland area.  I love fall, so I'm enjoying this immensely, and even noticing the first few leaves falling from the trees.  We live on a moderately long, not country road, but not well-developed either, which is lined with huge maple trees, and I can scarcely think of anything more beautiful than our street and our yard in the fall. ",

Zachsmom: You go girl! I am very impressed that you'll be running today.  My goal this year was to run in the Chicago marathon, but I wasn't far enough along in training by the time this cancer thing started, so I decided not to, but instead I decided to volunteer at the Breast Cancer Network of strength aid station.  I've never volunteered at a race before, but I decided it would be a good way for me to give something to both the breast cancer cause and to the race I love so much, and I thought it would help me to feel like I'm still connected to running even if I can't do much of it myself right now.  It's been nine years since I ran the Chi marathon, and was really excited about doing it this year, but now I know it will mean even more to me to run it next year after getting through all this.  I usually run with Team in Training (which raises money for the leakemia/lymphoma society, but next year I think I'll run with a breast cancer group and raise money for that instead. Anyway, you probably won't read this before the race, but I wish you the best run of your life anyway! lisasinglem: Wow! I didn't realize the show was starting so soon.  You've been a real trooper! As tired as I feel these days, I can only imagine what stamina it has taken for you to be at all those rehearsals, being on your feet all that time, and having to be \"on\" and, I imagine, having to prove to everyone that you are strong enough to do what needs to be done.  I'm proud of you! I bet you are probably somewhat on cloud nine after such a great show, but how are you holding up physically after all this? I do believe it's true that the more active your are, and the more you manage to live your life the way you usually would, the better you are in fighting the fatigue, but you have gone above and beyond!  I am rooting for you next weekend with your Tx followed by three weekend shows! You have all of our support and confidence behind you!  (But don't forget to come to us if it gets hard.) As for me, I'm just trying to keep my emotional head above water.  I'm not feeling bad about my cancer or Tx's.  I've had a rough time with se's, but I still have a very positive attitude about the whole thing in general and the Tx's in particular.  They're hard, but I've faced worse.  It's other stuff (combined with the drain and discomfort of cancer Tx I suppose) going on that is making things particularly difficult for me.  I find inspiration by thinking about all the millions of people in the world (and I think particularly of stories I've been told about my family and all my ancestors had to go through just to survive) who have had to deal with exponentially more difficult things.  For example, my husband's grandfather was in Germany during WWI, and his troops were very close to the Russian front line.  A battle broke out, and suddenly he found himself behind enemy lines with a bullet in his back after his troops had pulled back.  He hid out with no food or water and a bullet in a pile of concrete from a fallen building.  He hid there in a crevice for three days and nights before the Russian soldiers had pulled out, then set out walking by himself.  He ended up making his way on foot all the the way to Poland where a farm woman found him and nursed him back to health over a few months time.  Then I think of my grandmother whose husband suffered a stroke in the early fifties which paralyzed him almost completely from the neck down.  At that time, there were no good options for long-term care, especially since she had only a very small pension from the railroad where my grandfather worked. So she took care of him almost single-handedly in their home for seven years before he finally died. Can you imagine? So I think of people like them, and so many more, and I say to myself, \"If those people were strong enough to get through those things, then there's no reason why I can't be strong enough to get through this!\" Anyway, that's how I keep going, even now, when I'm not doing particularly well. Best wishes to all for a good day!",

And good luck to everyone getting Tx's this week.  My Tx is tomorrow, but I'm a little afraid that my psychiatrist is going to want to delay it.  I see him this afternoon, so I'll keep you posted. I wish I had another week before Tx anyway, because my se's were much more prolonged this last time, and I didn't get very many days of feeling relatively normal.  Oh well, the quicker it's over with, the better, right? Zenith: Happy belated birthday! I'm sorry you were feeling so crappy, and I hope you're feeling better today.  The upper body pain sounds pretty incapacitating.   Lizzy: Okay, not a GWB fan, so I begrudgingly thank you for pointing out the ways he helped us! Yes, I lost eyebrows and lashes about 2 1/2 weeks after first Tx.  Yes, dexamethazone (Decadron) can make you wired.  It can also cause mood fluctuations, so if you are prone to depression or any other mental illness be sure and discuss this with your doc (like in my case, I only get half the usual dose and for a shorter period of time, and I don't believe it has made se's any worse).  It can also cause weight gain/water retention., so don't be surprised if your weight goes up a little.  Statistics say that a majority of women undergoing brca chemo will gain between 5-10 pounds due to several factors - chemo drugs that increase appetite, esp. for bad carbs and sugar; steroids; lower activity level; induced menopause that causes changes in body composition; and water retention.  If you notice a lot of water retention (if you gain 5 or more lbs in a week, if your feet/ankles/hands are swollen and/or cold all the time, if you press on your skin and it leaves an indentation) you might want to talk to your doc about it, because they might recommend diuretics.  Otherwise, the usual steps - drink lots of water and lower salt intake.  Just remember, the water retention will go away after Tx.  It seems cruel, with all the other stuff we're dealing with to add weight gain to the mix! Onemonga: I don't have any answers on the liver issue, but I did want to clarify some of the language that's been used.  Liver enzymes can be abnormal for a variety of reasons (usually quite resolvable), but that DOES NOT mean you have liver damage! Hope it gets figured out soon. IowaSue: I'm sorry to hear about the headaches. Hope that gets figured out soon too! As for the alcohol question.  I often enjoy about 1/2 to 1 glass of wine in the evening (I'm a lightweight, but enjoy good wine). I never talked to my onc about it, but I've all but stopped, especially during first 2 weeks, because I noticed that it really drained my energy, even when I drank only a little.  I would point out, though, that while there is no link between smoking and breast cancer, there is strong scientific evidence that alcohol IS linked to breast cancer.   My quote for the day: \"Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work.  It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart.\" Yours truly. Good luck to everyone today! ",

Yes, it is a Godsend that we have Marlow.  We always have more than one dog so they can keep each other company.  Since Marlow is having so much trouble since Bixby's death, we're probably looking at getting a new puppy sooner than we might otherwise.  Dogs can get really, legitimately depressed, and I don't want this to scar him.  When Bixby was younger, we had two other dogs (this was before Marlow), and one of them, Juju, was his best friend in the world.  They were completely attached to each other.  Well, Juju died young, and Bixby became extremely depressed, so much so that his whole personality changed.  He was never the same dog after that, became much more withdrawn, less playful.  Not sulky or ill-tempered, but not ever as happy as he was when he had his friend.  We don't want that to happen to Marlow. (Thanks for letting me talk about my dog problems here.  I know they aren't cancer-related, but they're very much a part of my reality right now.) shiramg: I too am very thin, and it is worrisome sometimes, and makes some things harder.  For instance my bs told me I would not be a good candidate for a port because I have no fatty tissue up there, and the port would probably be pretty painful.  My onc told me at the beginning of chemo that if she saw any weight loss, she would suspend tx, but that hasn't been an issue.  Instead I've gained a little weight.  As for advice: first I would ask if your onc's practice/center has a nutritionist on staff that can help you plan out meals that would maximize nutrients and calories (I meet with one between each Tx) ; drink Boost or Ensure High Protein drinks (protein is a high priority during chemo -- you'll need more of it than usual; and like someone else said, carry hand sanitizer everywhere you go, and I would add, get used to things like using your elbows or sleeves to open doors, not touching things like the railings on escalators, you know, common sense stuff like that.  It's not much, but hope it helps. Adey: Have you had the Chicken Pox, because if you've had them, you cannot catch Shingles.  It is the same virus, and once you've had chicken pox, the virus stays in you, just lying dormant.  People develop shingles when for whatever reason (illness, trauma, stress, etc.) their immune systems are weakened and can't keep the virus dormant, so it becomes active again (that's why it's such a common occurrence among cancer patients).  But if you've had chicken pox, you already have the virus anyway.  Now, if you haven't had the chicken pox, then you can catch them from someone with shingles (although I've heard only if you come into contact with the liquid inside the blisters, but not certain about that).  And let me tell you, if you didn't have chicken pox as a child, you DO NOT want them as an adult.  Chicken pox hits adults much harder than children and can be quite dangerous.  There, that is my two cents on shingles! Jsw: You look absolutely adorable!! Onemonga: Congratulations on your labs having improved.  Glad you're getting the go-ahead.  Sending big virtual hugs to all of you!",

I was just wondering about something and thought y'all might indulge me.  It's too much to go back and look at everybody's diagnosis stories, but I am wondering out of all of us, how many were diagnosed by way of a routine mammogram.  I was.  I was thinking about it, because I was thinking about how lucky I am to have even had a routine mammogram at my age.  It was just after my 39th birthday, but I've been getting them since I was 33 because I had an autoimmune disease which caused my ovaries to fail and put me in premature menopause (hence the no children).  The whole thing made my getting cancer more rare than usual, especially at a relatively young age, because first, having an autoimmune disease (and I have three of them) means that your immune system is working in overdrive, so it should have actually provided me with more protection against cancer, and second because my body was producing so little estrogen from such a young age (and mine is ER+ 98%), that too should have given extra protection.  But that's all beside the point.  I suppose I could research the question and find statistics on how breast cancers are diagnosed, but I was just interested in doing a little survey among us.  Thanks in advance for indulging me, if you don't mind. Another question.... Does anybody else experience this?  Sometimes, I'll be doing fine, nausea-wise, feeling normal, and then suddenly, kind of like the way a hot flash happens, I'll just get this huge wave of nausea that comes over me, sometimes causing me to vomit, sometimes not, and then it goes away.  It's different from those times when I just have that low to mid-level constant nausea.  Anybody else have this, and if so, have you been able to link it to anything? Happened to me just a few minutes ago while I was reading posts, had to throw up, but feel back to normal now.  Weird. I have a dilemma I could use your advice on.  This evening in Chicago, there is a huge event with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.  My hubby and I are regular goers, and I follow the progress and news of the CSO and am a huge fan.  This season we (the CSO, that is) have a new and very promising maestro, Riccardo Mutti.  There has been much excitement about his taking over the symphony, and tonight is his debut concert, preceded by a performance of the Chicago Children's Chorus of which I am also a fan.  It is a free concert to be given at Millennium Park (formerly Grant Park), which is a beautiful, huge park right off the loop looking out onto Lake Michigan.  An outdoor venue, obviously with a wonderful stage and surprisingly good acoustics.  You take your lawn chairs and blankets and picnic baskets or whatever, and sit on the lawn to enjoy the concert with friends and lots of people, families around you.  I've been looking forward to this concert for a long time, as I have been eager to get a feel for Mutti, and love the idea of being at his inaugural performance.  Here's the but... I have a sore throat and thrush, with some indications that mouth sores are on their way.  I'm not concerned about the thrush, but the sore throat? And mouth sores that could indicate an infection brewing?  I haven't checked my temperature yet today because I started drinking hot coffee before it occurred to me to take it. Last night it was only 99.1, and I have run a low-grade fever between 99.1 and 99.9 all throughout chemo so far.  So, obviously, I will monitor how I feel and my temperature as the day goes on, but do y'all think I would be crazy to go (the weather will likely be chilly and moist), or is this no more risky than going to the grocery store with a sore throat and mild fever?  Maybe less risky than that, come to think of it, because grocery stores are full of germs and sick people! Anyway, I'd appreciate your input. Thanks.",

A very \"Chicago\" event.  Everybody had these little white flags that said \"Welcome, Muti!\" on them (Muti is the new maestro, and this was his debut performance with the CSO), and when he came to the stage, EVERYBODY stood up and clapped and cheered and waved their flags.  Millennium Park was absolutely crammed, standing room only around the outside borders of the lawn, and there was such an intimate, shared feeling of excitement and pride.  It really felt like an historic even, and it was.  I am actually proud of myself that I made it.  We've had to cancel so many things we had planned because I was too sick to go -- just last month we had to miss a Renee Fleming concert, the tickets for which I had paid dearly! And it really felt good that I was able to make it to this. I had been looking forward to it for a long time. I paid for it a little the next day, but it was totally worth it.  I hope that my experience may motivate others to take some risks once in a while and make themselves do the things they really want to do -- so long as it's possible and safe -- because, even if you have to turn around and come home ten minutes after you get there, you'll still be glad you went.",

As you probably remember, I recently lost my dog too, and it was also horrific, sudden, and traumatic.  I know exactly what you mean about the flashbacks.  I had them for weeks, and still do sometimes.   You WILL get through them and eventually your mind will be filled with happy memories.  It will take time, of course, but try, even now as much as you can to replace those horrible pictures in your mind with good ones.  I think it helps heal from the trauma a little faster.  You didn't mention guilt in your post, but I know, even though my Bixby was going to die no matter what I did, I still felt guilty.  It's because we feel so responsible for our pets, and if anything goes wrong we, or I, couldn't help but go back and \"woulda\" \"shoulda\" myself into craziness.  I hope you are not struggling with  this, or your husband.  And as Lisa said, it is perfectly normal to be angry at God.  It is in fact, psychologically speaking, one of the first steps in the grieving process.  It doesn't mean your faith is weakened, or that there's anything wrong with your relationship with God.  It just means your hurting and angry.  It's natural.  My faith is different than yours, but even so, just think of all the biblical stories of God's people crying out in anger and desperation, shaking their fists at God.  You will come to peace with God again, but, and I don't mean to be presumptious about your belief system, but I'm guessing that it is part of your faith to be honest with God, and now is one of those times. Anyway, I'm sorry to go on.  I know when this happened to me and my husband, the wound was just too deep for a while for any words of consolation to do much good.  It just hurt.  Period. But know that I am thinking about you, your husband, and your grandson, and that I am so so sorry you had to go through this especially now.  Take what comfort you can from knowing that you were a good mommy to Pup, and even though his death was unfair and untimely, you gave him the best gifts any dog can ever receive, you love and companionship, your devotion and protection. {{{{HUGS}}}} Whitney Oh, and if you would like to talk more in depth about this, please post as much as you want.  Everybody was very understanding about my need to talk about it when it happened to me.  And please feel free to PM me if you'd like. ",

It may not seem like much, but it's pretty darn good for me! And the best part is that when I did wake up at 4, I wasn't even sweaty!  That was an enormous treat! LadyinBama: I am so sorry to hear that you're in the hospital, especially on your anniversary.

Onemonga: Good luck with your newly retired hubby.  I have forgotten, are you working? Jsw19: Ouch! sorry about the lousy chemo experience! I hope they do better next time.  Also, one trick, if you didn't know, is drink lots of water right before your Tx. It helps plump up the veins. Calamtykel: I too am amazed. If you handed me a bag of wheat grains I wouldn't know whether to grind them under my shoe or make little bean bag animals out of them.  You should write a cookbook! Lizzy: Thanks for remembering about my appointment (are you sure you have chemo brain??). It went well. My doc did an ultrasound and said that what's happening is that I have a major chemo-induced inflammatory process going on with all my innards, essentially, and all the inflammation is causing my uterus to be smooshed over.  So no tumors!  And thanks for the cape.  To tell you the truth, this week has been one of those weeks when I felt like I really did earn it.  ",

Plus, I have lymphedema in my left arm, and the infection in my nails has cause a major flare-up of that.  My left arm is about a third bigger than my left arm and very sore.  All from my fingernails.  I'm telling you all this not to scare you or bum you out, but to stress how important it is that you keep a close eye on them, and report to your onc and of those signs of infection. Like any other infection during chemo, it can get bad quickly. My onc's nurse told me they may or may not fall off, but that if I have two more treatments she said they probably will fall off.  Fortunately, my nails aren't growing so I don't have to clip them, because that would hurt more than I can imagine.  Be careful.  Also, I found out that this tends to happen at the end of treatment or even after it's over.

Yesterday I was at a store paying, and the poor cashier girl didn't know what to say because I was blowing my nose every six seconds and wiping my eyes.  She was just really quite.  I didn't explain because I didn't know which would be harder for her, thinking I was crying my eyes out or being told I'm in chemo.  Anyway, it's not just from lack of nose hair/eyelashes, thought that probably doesn't help.  It is a common side effect of taxotere (at least), and it's one of those cumulative se's, so it gets worse with every Tx.  It is weird though, how your nose is either running like crazy or completely dried out.  I know that when I am outside my eyes and nose run more, like in the wind or if it's chilly.  And it's weird how sometimes it's just one eye and other times it's both. Another cumulative se: migraines.  Anyone else having those.  I've been getting them since my second Tx, but now, after the fourth, they're coming more frequently and more painfully.  This morning, when I woke up, I couldn't even move my head or anything else for about twenty minutes.  So I got up and took 1000 mg of Tylenol and started drinking coffee (migraine meds are just pain killers with caffeine), and the coffee seems to be helping a little.  I've never really had migraines until chemo, but I know that's what they are because I get auras and it hurts to move my head or look into lights, and they make me nauseous.  I feel bad for people who get regular migraines.  Anybody having this?  Know any particular goo solutions? As for my nails, even though I'm on antibiotics, they continue to hurt more each day, and I can see them filling up more with pus under the nail beds.  I worried the antibiotics aren't doing the trick, even though they're high dose.  And I asked a nurse if she thought they were going to fall off, and she said, \"You've just had your fourth treatment right?  They may or may not fall off, but if you have two more treatments still, they probably will.\"  I'm using tea tree oil on them, as I've heard that can help with the cracking and peeling, though none of the nurses have mentioned this.   Now, my appointment with the oncologist yesterday.  I am going to go forward with more treatment with him.  First of all, I found out the onc I've been with lied to me about two things.  First she told me she couldn't give me TC x 6 because it's not in NCCN guidelines, Like I've mentioned.  But two of her nurses told me that they DO give TC x 6.  They weren't outing her for lying. It just came up.  Like during my first TX (after my onc had told me she couldn't give TC x 6, when the nurse was going over all the chemo basics, she asked how many TX's I was getting, and I said four.  She said okay, and I just casually asked, \"Do you also treat patients with TC X 6?\" and she said, \"Yes, we do sometimes.\"  Then last week when I was talking to my onc's personal nurse about my nails and she said, if you still have two more Tx's, then they probably will fall off, I asked again, \"Do you do TC x 6 in this practice?\" (she didn't know anything about the conversations I'd had with the onc about it), she said, \"Oh sure, depending on the patient, but yeah, we do six Tx's for some patients.\"  So it appears that my onc was not truthful about \"not being allowed\" to give me 6 Tx's.  Then the other lie was about insurance, which I think I've mentioned.  At the beginning of all this, when I was asking her about TC x 6, she said, \"Even if I wanted to give you six, your insurance wouldn't cover the last two.\" Since then I have asked around with a lot of women getting TC x 6, and found out that not one of them has had trouble getting insurance coverage for it.  So she lied to me twice.  I've even spoken to several women who are getting TC x 6 and have Illinois BC/BS, which is what I have. And if they are going to cover it, then I suspect most other ins. companies would too. So my trust in my onc dropped dramatically.   So I went to see the other onc, whom I had seen in the beginning for a second opinion.  He was very surprised when I told him what she had said about the NCCN Guidelines, and about the insurance thing, and he looked very surprised and said, \"Well, I don't know why she would have told you all that.\"  Anyway, he said, that while there are no studies proving additional benefits to 6 Tx's, or for stopping at 4 for that matter, he looked over my path report and said, he can see good reasons for getting the two additional Tx's, even though there are no studies yet proving this to be more beneficial.  He said four might be just fine, and that as a rule he doesn't like to expose his patients to any more chemo than necessary, but given the particularities of my case, he could see good reason for maximizing chemo.  More importantly, he said, \"It's really up to you.  Your are very smart.  You've done your homework.  You know the possible risks as well as possible benefits, and the bottom line is you have to do whatever it takes to feel confident in the treatment you get so that, psychologically you can move on, and put this behind you without second-guessing your care.  If you feel you need to be more aggressive in order to  know that you and your team have done everything possible to better your chances, then I am more than willing to give you six tx's.\" He said, \"I know you don't want to be in a position where, God forbid, four years from now you have a recurrence or metastisis, and have to look back, and second-guess your treatment, or blame yourself for not pushing to get the treatment you feel you need.\" So that sealed the deal, and I am switching to his care, his practice, and I get my next Tx next Wed.  I have mixed feelings because it just feels backwards to be pushing for more of the Tx that's kicking my ass every single day, but I am relieved two, because now I will not have to carry any doubts with me into the future.  I will be able to feel that I did everything I could.  And I simply would not be able to continue being cared for by a doctor who out and out lied to me twice, in order to protect her ego.  I think two things factored in to how she handled this whole thing.  First I just don't think she liked her authority or her decision being questioned.  (She got testy each time I brought it up.) And second, in the beginning she was advocating for ACT, but then consulted some colleagues, a few of whom recommended TC x 4, and I don't think she wanted to risk going against their advice, or risking criticism from her colleagues.   Anyway, it is settled now, and I am much more at peace, even though it means more chemo. Any feedback? One of the disappointing things about my appt. with this onc (Dr. Kash), is that he was recommending that I consult with a radiation onc, because he said, my case is borderline in terms of whether to get rads or not. But then I told him I have moderately serious Lymphedema on my left side, and he said, \"Well forget that then.  Radiation would definitely complicate your lymphedema, and radiation is not worth the risk, since you already have LE.\"  So that was kind of frustrating.  To tell you the truth, I am very depressed about this LE.  It doesn't seem like it's going to be easily managed, and I'm really scared of it. And the thought that radiation might help me, but is not an option, kind of gets me down a little.  But I'm going to not worry about it and look ahead to finishing chemo and then get to the aromatase inhibitors.  Just trying to focus on the grateful side for not having to undergo rads.  Anyway, after all the drama from the very beginning about the peculiarities of my case and deciding about chemo Tx, I finally feel like the right decision has been made, and I can put doubts and second-guessing behind me.  So whew! Thank you all for all your support and feedback throughout this tiresome process!  Texas: Congratulations on the apartment!!! That sounds like a great gift. And congratulations to your husband for making SWAT.  My sister and brother-in-law are cops in Ft. Worth, and my sis just got promoted a few months ago to Corporal Detective. Are you in the Ft. Worth area? Lady: How are you doing? Any news about getting to go home? Best to all. Here's hoping for an easy day for everybody! ",

HOWEVER, you should not take more than 4000 mg of acetominophen within 24 hours.  Also, if your are on any other pain medications, read what's in it, because a lot of pain meds have acetominophen in them, like Vicodin, Lortab, Tylox, and Percocet, and I believe Tramadol. Also over the counter meds like allergy meds and cold remedies. So if you take any of those, don't take Tylenol. Hope that helps. Cal: SO sorry about your horrible blood draw.  Did it make you feel light-headed at all? Maybe next time you can specifically ask for that guy.  ",

I'm sure I'm a blast from the past, but lately I've really been missing you, and felt the need to check in, see how folks are doing, and also get a little support for myself.  I've read a lot of posts, but obviously don't know everything that's going on.  It sounds as if cancer-wise most are basically doing okay.  There have been a few posts from the last month or so that I thought I would chime in on.   Rachel: I'm very impressed that you're running in a race next month.  Which race, and where? Also, I'm curious, When did you start training again, and how was it? I've been a runner all my life, love running marathons, and I have had the hardest time with itever since about my third or fourth chemo Tx. My bocy is still extremely weak, and my cardio health very depleted.  Any advise? Hot flashes: What a joy! A few things, if you don't already know... Yes, food can definitely trigger hf's, but the thing is, it's not necessarily the same food for eveybody.  You have to figure out which foods are affecting you. Next, you all may know this already, but the antidepressant Effexor works very well for most of the women who use it for hf's.  Also, as far as psychiatric drugs go (somethings I have A LOT of experience with), there are relatively few side effects.  Happily, one of them is increased energy and alertness.  Also, the drug gabapentin (generic for Neurontin), has also been shown to be very usefull with hot flashes and body temperature regularity in general.  You may have heard of this drug during or after Tx, because it's primary use is to treat neuropathic pain, such as peripheral neuropathy.  I've heard from a few sources that it's success rate in terms of hot flashes is above 30%.  Sorry if y'all knew all this already.   Sweeney and others, I am not on Tamox myself. but I did research it before beginning my aromatase inhibitors, and yes, mood swings occur frequently. Now for my check-in.  The months since Tx ended have been in some ways harder to endure than chemo was.  A big part of that was how much my body changed.  Like most, I had gained weight during chemo, but I gained even more post-chemo, i.e. during AI treatment.  A little caveat here; I have struggled with anorexia nervosa all of my life since I was 12, so while no one wants to gain weight, for me, I actually have to make a choice between my eating disorder and my cancer treatment.  I cannot begin to explain to you just how torturous the weight gain has been.  I am 5' 7\", and when I began Tx, I weighed 98 pounds.  I was told by my then oncologist that if I didn't gain weight, or if during Tx I ever lost any weight, she would discontinue chemo.  Ao I did what I had to do.  I ate.  And since that day, in this way, every week has brought me psychologically down just a little bit.  Now, after chem and approximately 8 months of aromatase inhibitors I weigh 166.  That is a number I NEVER thought I would get to, and if I did, well, it would be very bad.  So weight, and with it, losing my formerly athletic, running, strong body, and melding into this spare-tired, weak, old, painful body has been far worse than the disease or the treatment itself. Also, you may or may not remember, that I came out of my surgeries with a serious case of lymphedema.  Well, it didn't get any better.  Instead, worse,  I have been giving myself manual drainage massage every day since sometime lastAugust.  I have been through seven custom-fitted compression garments, and when those weren't enough, would carefully wrap my hand and arm, according to very specific directions with about two-inch thick layers of different kinds of bandages., and, finally, I have been seeing an occupational therapist since last July sometimes five times a week, and when I was lucky, only two or three times.  I feel like my occupational therapist is like my best friend now! Because of these things, I never got to feel like I was done with treatment.  And of course, now I am in hormonal Tx, which doesn't seem to be working out.  I've already switched from Arimidex to Aromasin because I was in so much pain on Arimidex that I literally could not climb stairs or even lift myself out of a chair without something firm to hold onto. I haven't been on Aromasin very long, but the same side effects are already beginning.  I'm not sure I will be able to continue hormonal Tx. I'm sorry to dump all this on you, especially since I haven't even been around for so long. But I haven't yet told you the worst part.  Some recent tests have revealed a very real possibility that my bc has metastesized to my liver.  And I'm scared to death.  I don't know yet if it's even true, but my liver enzymes are elevated along with my monocytes (which are often linked to liver diseas or damage), and I have most of the symptoms of liver-related cancer.  Now, I take a lot of medications because I am also bipolar, and that requires a cocktail of several classes of drugs. And I've had other health issues lately.  So there could be a hundred other reason for the labs and the symptoms.  Still, I'm scared to death.  Don't worry, I'm not panicking.  I haven't made up my mind that the news will be bad and that I'll be dead in two months! I am handling it, and taking care of myself through the inevitable waiting that seems to be inherent in any disease diagnosis.  I'm doing everything I can to keep myself busy and distracted so that my mind doesn't go crazy with horrible scenarios.  In fact, that kind of reaction really isn't a part of my personality.  I tend to be pretty mellow about things. And to tell you the God's honest truth, even when I was first diagnosed I can't say I ever actually experienced fear.  My only fear, I think, was worrying about my husband. But this time I'm scared.  Metestatic bc is a whole new ball game, as you know.  And any cancer that involves the liver never has a good prognosis, if there is a prognosis at all!  So, I truly apologize for going on so long, and for showing up on your doorsteps in the shape I'm in.  I hope you can believe, that while I did think of this group as a good way to get some support through this, I also still care about each of you deeply, have never forgotten any of you, and want to be here for you too. Thanks for letting me go on (not that you really had a choice). Whitney ",

      "Content": "Oct 7, 2011 01:45PM wherria wrote: Kel: Sorry about the meno symptoms. (And by the way, I have come TO HATE THE WORD SYMPTOM!) Anyway, Kel, the answer to your question about peri vs menopause is that when your ovaries finally stop producing eggs you are menopausal.  What I don't know is What's the difference between menopause and postmenopause?? As I have mentioned before I entered menopause when I was 33 -- right about the time my dh and I were wanting to start a family.  But seven years later I still have night sweats and hot flashes.  The memory stuff is hard to sort out for me, because I have had so many psychiatric medications that can cause memory loss, and about 60+ electroconvulsive therapy treatments.  Add menopause, especially at a young age to that, and who knows what all is contributing to memory loss.  Kel, I hear you about being somewhat relieved, but also somewhat saddened by it.  I can identify with the sadness part instantly. My fervent hope for you is that you have built the family you wanted and are consoled by that. For all of us: let us not forget that stress can be a major cause of memory loss, particularly short term memory loss (Lizzy, like leaving cash laying around graocery stores!) I imagine it must be very difficult for those of you whose menopause was either brought about because of chemotherapy, or at least has changed your hormonal needs, productions, and receptions.  It must be hard to figure out what *SYMPTOMS* ARE COMING FROM WHERE.  I have that problem too, but not related to menopause.  My mother is 72.  She had a hysterectomy when she was about 37 because of suspicious looking fibroids.  They took her ovaries too (not sure why) and so she was catapulted into a menopause that was pretty much the worst menopause I could imagine. Her two sisters were the same way.  Strangely their mother wasn't. But given that I'm 7 years out, I'm starting to worry that I'm going to step right into my mother's footprints.  Of course my mother never exercises.  She was a professional woman, very high up on the corporate ladder, giving presentations too various boards, etc.  Anyway, not too long ago, I asked her what the worst part of menopause has been for her, and she very quickly replied that she was often embarrassed in from of her colleagues.  She was at the front end of the feminists' climb into positions of upper management, and still had to struggle against the old boys network, yada, yada.  I'm sure you get the picture.  But, she said that one day she just decided screw this.  I'm a woman who is undergoing a very physically demanding, and for that matter, revealing natural change. So she told me about a time when she was adressing the combined boards of directors from all of their international locations, and she's trying to pitch some idea.  But in the middle of her presentation, which was about 90 minutes long, she felt a hot flash coming on.  She started to get nervous, and as she became hotter, and the redness of her face and the sweat running down her face, taking mascara with it, she became really embarassed.  Mostly, though, she worried a lot about whether this groups of old white men would take her seriously. So, like the stong woman she is, she stopped her presentation, said, \"I'm sorry for interupting the flow of our meeting time but I will be right back.  She left the board room, went to her office and picked up a magazine.  Back in the board room, she stto up at the podium again, and said, these days, my body seems to have a mind of its own, and it was making me hot.  With that, she resumed her lecture, but this time waving herself with the magazine.  And the best partis that no one seemed phased by it.  There were no comments.  She was overwhelmingly successful with her multi-million dollar proposal.  I have great admiration for my mother, and I believe what she did that day, given the infancy of feminism at that time, was extremely brave, and perhaps was one small part in helping other women in the company advance and be taken seriously. However, I think things might have happened very differently, and perhaps the outcome had been much less favorible if she hadn't stood there with the confidence and strength that are simply inherant characteristics of hers. Self confidence goes a long way.  It won't make menopausal symptoms go away, but it might help in dealing with them. but here she is at 72 still having severe nightsweats and hot flashes, and so am I. My husband siezes this as an opprotunity both to push at me a little and at my mom at the same time.  When I tell him i fear my post-menopausal life is going to be just like Mom's, he screams, \"No!! You promised!  You said when we got married -- it was practically in our wedding vows, that you would NEVER turn into your mother! Lol.  Well, once again, I am out of time.  I'm on my way to the hospital for a 10:45 CT scan. Bleck! Goodnight, friends ",

Or something like that.  And just to go a little further, I would then take it to the principle or superintendent or whoever, maybe with a critical mass of other parents, and request/demand that all teachers be required to watch it.  Just my 4 cents. Oh, also congratulations on being done with herceptin!!! Lizzy: I'm sorry that things are so difficult with your friend.  It sounds like he is in a lot of pain.  Maybe you could tell him that if he believes God will cure him, then maybe God plans to cure him throught the use of modern medicine. And how could he know?  After all, if God chooses who to save and who not to save, then it wouldn't matter whether s/he took medicine or not.  And also, in a way, he is claiming god-like power by saying that the power of his prayer is such that it can change the will of God. I believe there are many many wonderful things about prayer, and I mean in all faiths.  Prayer can be healing, perhaps even physically healing; prayer can strengthen your relationship with the holy, however you define that; and it can play a big role in helping you to become a better, kinder, stronger person; and praying for others helps us build compassion and love for those we care about.  But I do not believe prayer has the power to determine the mind of the holy (in fact, I personally don't believe the holy has a mind per se, but that's not the point). Nor do I believe that prayer has the power to determine life's course of events.  I pray, but I don't pray to change God.  I pray to change me.",

I'm thinking this weekend.  As for the heartburn, my nurse told me to take Prilosec (olmeprazole) would work better than Pepto. Lisa: I'm right there with you! Neulast... bone pain... mack truck.  I did take the Claritin, but I don't know if it helped or not, because there's definitely been, and still is, pain.  Same for me - days 3 and 4 very hard.  I was also hesitant to mention it, but like you, I figured maybe it will get better from here.  Are you having muscle pain too?  I am, especially in my back. Tylenol has helped enough that I've been able to get out some, but I'm disappointed that I haven't felt up for running.  Just reminding myself that this will only last a few days, and then I can try to run again.  Anybody doing any massage?  I'm thinking it may help, but I still have fluid retention and swelling from surgeries, and regular massage can be very counter-productive if you're trying to prevent Lymphedema, and Lymphedema massage is a very unique specialty, so going for a massage has me worried. Anybody else still doing occupational or physical therapy post-mastectomy, and if so, how are you doing with that at the same time as chemo? Good luck with your shave today, Lisa.  I look forward to hearing how it went. LadyinBama: I'm just thinking about this issue that several of us seem to be having with our dh's and how much and what to talk to them about, etc. You didn't ask for my advice, but I have a few thoughts if that's okay.  Do you think it might help to ask him, at a time when he seems at his best in terms of communication and sensitivity, why he has such a strong reaction to the things you're reading about?  Do you think it would help to explain to him, that, for you, the place you are in now, and have been for such a long time, is a place with too many unknowns, and that learning about other peoples' experiences helps you deal with how emotionally difficult it is to have all these unknowns hanging over your head?  That for you, knowing about the possibilities is easier than having to be afraid of surprises.  That in fact, you think the unknowns may be harder, emotionally at least, than dealing with whatever se's may eventually come your way.   I'd hate for you to have to give up talking to him about this stuff altogether.  I know that when I did basically this with my dh it helped us both.  I was able to tell him clearly that I was not obsessing or assuming that everything I read about was going to happen to me, but that hearing about the things that, some of which anyway, could happen actually helped me reign in my own imagination about the worst possible scnario. And I was able to tell him clearly what I needed from him, namely to be able to talk to him about all this stuff without feeling judged.  And it helped him too (I just asked him to tell me how it helped, so this is from him), because by asking him why he was responding the way he was helped him realize that it was because of his own difficulty imagining these se's happening to me, and that he actually needed to voice, or at least realize, what his specific fears were. He agreed that talking about how he was reacting and being asked to help me in a specific way really opened things up for both of us.  You can explain to him, that you know all he really wants is to help you, and that it would be a big help if you could go on sharing with him what you're learning, and that it might in fact help you not to dwell on the scary stuff because things that remain hidden or secret or unspoken so often take on so much more power than if they were just out in the open. My husband also told me that it was a revelation to him until I brought this up how lonely and isolated I felt in all my wondering about what was going to happen to me, and that it was actually a relief for him to know that here was something he could actually do to make this a little easier for me.  He says, \"I needed to be told that you were feeling lonely and isolated in this, and, I know it's a guy thing to say, but guys understand this, I needed to 'man up' and do what I could to help my wife.\"  He just told me (I hope you don't mind that I've brought him into this conversation), that he has felt better since we talked about it, and has actually felt better himself in terms of his own fears of se's.  Anyway, sorry if I'm barging in with unsolicited advice, but it seemed like an important thing, and I wanted to share how it worked out for me.",

I want to thank all of your who have responded so sympathetically about my dog.  It has meant a lot to me that you all have understood what a big deal this is to me.  I know that many of your are having to figure out how to handle br ca with your children, and I can only imagine how hard that must be, but I don't have children, can't, and I know it's not near the same, but my dogs are like my babies.  And especially Bixby.  We got him as our tenth anniversary present (we get a new dog every fifth anniversary), and he and I have always had a really special bond.  I don't go anywhere without him, and he isn't nearly as attached to anyone as he is to me.  Anyway, that was good news, and a relief, but the day got worse from there.   After the vet, I had an appt. with my therapist, but I couldn't get there in time, so I just talked to her on the phone, and it was kind of intense.  Then I just went home to rest, as I was starting to feel pretty bad.  The bone pain from the Neulasta shot has really stayed with me, all my long bones, femurs, shins, and all my ribs, front and back.  And I was developing a major headache, which is rare for me.  As I was on my way home, I started having more trouble swallowing because my mouth sores started to get really bad.  I'd had them since Wed., but yesterday for some reason, they started getting much worse, and started moving down into my esophagus.  I had to pull over at two different stores on the way home to use their bathrooms (diarrhea), was getting nauseous, and the muscles in my back which have been hurting from the taxotere, started really cramping up.  I don't know why it all seemed to get worse on day 5 five around the same time (an infection maybe?), but by the time I got home, I was in so much pain I was almost vomiting.  So I took some anti-nausea meds and some Tylenol and lay down for a while.  It helped a little, so I went out again, can't remember where, but it all started coming back.  So I went home again, called my onc's office and told them what was going on, especially about the leper's colony that was growing in my mouth by that point.  I was told a nurse would call me back \"shortly.\"  Almost two hours later, she called.  I described everything.  She wanted to know if I had a fever and I said no, but that I had been taking two extra strength Tylenol every four hours, so who knows if I would have had a fever or not.  She asked if I could come in at 2:30 for the nurse practitioner to look at my mouth.  So I did.  Turned out, at the doc's office, I did have a fever, despite just taking my last dose of Tylenol about an hour before.  She said my mouth was severe, but didn't look infected.  She did a blood count, and said my WBC's and platelets were low, but not alarmingly so, even though it was a little bit early for them to have dropped even as much as they did.  So a little leukopenic, but she didn't seem worried.  She gave me a scrip for Miracle Mouthwash and a relatively mild pain reliever (Tramadol), or at least a low dose of is, for my muscle and back pain. And she said that my onc. is on call this weekend and if the Miracle Mouthwash wasn't enough to page her, and that there are other things they can give me -- I wondered why she didn't just do that then because she said my mouth looked so severe! So I had to drive back to the pharmacy to get the scripts filled, which  made me kind of cranky, because I really didn't feel up for doing it, but, my husband is working is Chicago on a movie set, and my best friend who would have bee happy to help was also in the city. We have a lot of friends, but very few of them are local, so that just left me.  I was miserable driving to and from the pharmacy, and think I even got a little weepy while I was waiting for my scripts.   Well since pain meds always make me nauseous, I went home and took a Kytril, waited a few minutes the took the Tramadol, rinsed my mouth out (I don't know about others who have tried the Miracle Mouthwash, but it didn't do much more for me than the baking soda/saltwater rinse they recommend.  But I did it a few times.  She had told me to swallow it since the sores were growing down into my throat, which I did once, but it didn't help a lot, and I didn't want to be zonked out by the Benadryl that's in the mouthwash, so mostly I just swished.   I should have eaten something, but my mouth hurt too badly to open it wide enough to get food in there, so I sipped on an Ensure after it got to be room temperature (easier on the sores that way). It felt like a very lonely day.  The sores didn't get much better, but I kept swishing with the two rinses )I had also tried Biotene -- that's what I've been using for years due to dry mouth from other meds -- but it the nurse had told me the baking soda/saltwater rinse would do a better job neutralizing the ph balance in my mouth, and I agree that it helped more yesterday at least than the Biotene. Fortunately, my husaband got home not long after I did (a rare occurrence, as most of the time when he is working  -- he is a free-lance Art Director and Production Designer in Chicago's film industry -- he usually gets home around the time I go to bed), so that was good.  He brought flowers with him too.  He says a fresh bouquet each week or every several days throughout chemo!   But by the time he got home, I could tell the Tramadol  wasn't working.  It may have helped with the bone pain, but I couldn't see straight my back was hurting so bad.  I've always been an athlete, and someone who is very physically active, not afraid to lift, carry, or anything else really, but I have never experienced muscle pain like this before.  It brought tears to my eyes.  Had to take another anti-nausea pill (Compazine), and just lie still.  I managed to get down a little bit of mashed potatoes (a good, though not protein-rich food, soft, easy to tolerate food I recommend for those times when you just can't figure out what to eat.)  I was starting to feel a little better, mostly from lying absolutely flat in my bed, but I still had aches all over and started feeling around them.  That when I discovered about a nickel-sized, palpable lump under my right arm, (the good side).  I have felt soreness there before , but have never been able to feel it, until last night.  It's strange, since this whole CA Dx started, I have not really felt scared.  Just about a few possible side effect, but never about the cancer actually having the potential to kill me, even when my docs were cautioning me that my cancer has some ominous features.  I still haven't really been scared about the disease itself.  But I felt this lump, and my dh was lying next to me messing around on his computer, and I just started to cry (first time that's happened except when I've cried fro him or for my parents).  All the sudden, it struck me, \"I know this CA's in my lymph system; I know my onc has told me she's not seeking for a cure, and that I will always carry a risk of recurrence or mets, above and beyond the general population; I know that she's told me we're aiming for remission here, and I've handled all that news fine, but this time ladies, I got scared.   I know a swollen lymph node can mean a multitude of things, and given how badly I felt yesterday, it could just be my body dealing with whatever is going on inside it, but I'm scared anyway.   One of the things that has been an issue for me is weight loss.  I've lost a fair amount of weight since this all started, and just the other day, my surgeon told me that a recurrence or a new CA site would be easy for me to feel because of my thinness, so part of me is wondering, has this lump been there all along and is now palpable because I've lost more weight? I had a PET scan, but I don't know how reliable that is since it didn't pick up the lymph involvement on the original brca side.  No one ever did an ultrasound of the right side.  So,  I could go on, but the bottom line is I'm alarmed.  My dh wants to page my onc this weekend, but I told him that nothing would happen until Mon. anyway when she would have a chance to examine me. This morning, my mouth is ever so slightly better, but the back pain came back once I started getting up and moving around.  I've just taken an anti-nausea pill and pain pill.  I hope they work. On the up side, if I can get out and about, I'm getting my head shaved today.  A little nervous, but mostly feeling pretty darn good about it. ",

I got so caught up in telling my motorcycle story, I forgot to tell y'all that finally, after begging all of my doctors, and getting nowhere, I finally talked to my onc and not his nurse, last night, and he agreed to run a liver panel.  I kind of had to talk him into it. At first he said that his approach would be to repeat the labs in about a month or more.  I said, \"I understand that, and I know that my levels are not seriously high, but I am really nervous about this.\" (One thing I have learned is that when it is metastatic cancer affecting the liver, the enzymes might or might not be raised, and if they are, it tends to be only mildly, which is part of why this has been troubling me.  That and that my symptoms are common symptoms of live disease.) Anyway, I said, \"I don't usually walk around in fear of recurrence all the time, but this one has me scared.  Would you mind doing a liver panel instead of just repeating the chemistry?\" He said, \"Well we could do that.\" Then he described how \"this is the problem with these kind of tests.  They're a little bit off, and then we end up doing all kinds of tests and scans, only to find out in the end, that it is all okay after all.\" This makes sense to me and at the same time infuriates me.  So I didn't give up.  I new that I was not going to feel resolved until I knew what the other liver values were, and I knew that I was going to have to advocate fiercely to get it. Then I just expressed again that I was really scared, and he said, \"Okay, let's go ahead and repeat the labs next week.\"  Errrr! And I said, thinking this might work ( and it did), \"Do you meana liver panel or just a repeat chemistry?\" And he said, \"Well, okay, we'll do a liver panel.  Do you want to do it tomorrow?\"  \"YES.\" So, whew, Im getting the labs today.  It is still a mystery to me why my doctors have been so casual and dismissive about the lab results I already have, especially since I am also symptomatic. But, oh well, I'll just take what I can get at this point. Along these lines, I'd like to ask y'all to describe what kind of regular tests or screenings your oncs are ordering.  For instance, how often are you supposed to get bone density tests? Does your onc test for tumor markers? How often do you see your onc? What kinds of labs do you get, and how frequently? Etc.  I would really appreciate hearing about these things from you, because I'm not comfortable with how my onc is treating the post-chemo testing/screening.  Thank you. ",

The stuff you drink before (starts with an F but I don't remember the rest. Sorry.) the scan is picked up by the cell and sort of enters it. Every cell stays alive by metabolizing glucose, and this stuff kind of labels the glucose inside the cell, or makes it visible to the machine (that's the positron emission part.). you wait for about half an hour I think, giving the solution time to enter the cells and begin metabolizing. Then they put you in the scanner and watch as they cells do their thing. Normal cells metabolize the sugar gradually, but cancer cells, because the are such restless little things changing and dividing all the time, \"eat up\" the glucose at a much faster rate. The image from the scanner lights up where there is cancer, and that's how the docs can tell where you have cancer in your body. The stuff you drink has a very short half-life and is excreted in your urine within hours. So really, the risk or possible damage really is about the same as one x-ray. The PET scan is not 100% reliable though. It sees a lot, but it is not as clear as an MRI would be, for example. So it gives a very good diagnosis of where there is cancer, but without much detail. Sorry folks. Here I go, going on again, but I have to say one more thing The PETscan is not very effective for detecting cancer cells in the liver. I don't understand it all too well, but it has something to do with the fact the the liver is not a \"hollow\" organ. It has other little organs and tissues within it which makes it very dense and not very revealing on a PET scan. Also, I think the live, for some reason is covered on the outside by a thin layer of these strange little cells that are resistant to glucose, so watching as cells metabolizes sugar isn't really relevant with the liver.",

Texas: Thank you very much for the info about both the bottled water industry (I had no idea, and am a little bit more pissed at corporate America/the rest of the world than I already was), and about your follow-up care.  I'd still appreciate it if others could chime in too, with specificity if possible.  Thanks. Yes, we all seem to be fired up about how little attention our docs give us once chemo is over, and I'm right on board. Have y'all noticed that everything you read about cancer says that after chemo your doctor will do regular labs and bone scans (that's actually what I meant, Tex), physical exams, AND other tests to make sure other organs have not been damaged.  For instance, I've been reading a lot lately about mets to the liver, as you know, and everywhere it says that if you have been treated for a primary cancer in another part of your body, your doctor will want to follow- up with regular liver panels to screen for metastesis.  Well, how many of us have gotten that?  I couldn't even get one when my chemistry showed elevated liver enzymes, AND I was/am symptomatic.  Crazy.  And one of the reasons I have asked you all about what your oncs are doing with you now is that about three months ago, I mentioned to my onc that it had been about a year and a half since I'd had a bone scan, and should we be doing another.  He shrugged and said, \"Naw, I only do those every other year.\" Also Tex and Lizzy, what is Redbox? Lady: As you know, I was away from the group for quite awhile, and missed a lot.  I am so sorry to hear that you have had to face ovarian cancer too!  I am so sorry! But very glad to hear about your clean scan! You asked about Arimidex. I was on it for about six months, and I have to say, it was not pleasant.  There were some minor things that didn't concern me much, but three things REALLY did. 1 - terrible joint and muscle pain. Mostly joint pain, and mostly in my hips, back and knees.  The knees were the worst. 2 - weakness, even more than the weakness I had during chemo.  3 - lots of weight gain.  I'm sorry to have to report this stuff, and you know as well as I do, that we all react differently, but I figured you would want to hear the truth.  And just to re-enforce the point, I have read in many places that someone can have a terrible reaction to one AI, and do splendidly on another; and someone can have a terrible reaction to one, while someone else does splendidly.  I had to stop the Arimidex, because the pain got too great for me to handle, and I couldn't stop the weight gain.  Of course, my onc said the weight gain was not at all related to the AI, but I will never believe him on that.  I have known way too many women, both on these boards, and in my non-cyber life who had the same reaction, to the same extent. Anyway, now I am on Aromasin, and so far doing better than I did on Arimidex.  I haven't been on it very long, so the jury's still out.  So far, I have had a little joint pain, but nothing compared to the last, some brain fog/confusion (there's a funny story there too).  My bipolar disorder has not been very stable lately, and I have had to go back to electroconvulsive therapy (which works miracles somtimes and is not spooky or barbaric like most people think it is).  I'm telling you this because Aromasin is a steroidal-based drug (one of the other two are too, but I don't remember which), and steroidal drugs have the potential to dramatically affect mood in people with mental illness.  They can have a similar effect in healthy people, but not to the same extreme, so that's another thing I and my docs are waiting and watching for.  Hope that wasn't too much information, and best of luck on the Arimidex. Let's just assume it will be the right drug for you, and maybe it will be! Lizzy: Thank you so much for telling us about the Diane Sawyer report! I had never heard of this specialty and will definitely look into it.  I have had QT prolongation in the past, which is why my onc didn't use Adriamiasin on me, so I've been a little concerned about my heart, especially since it has been an uphill and largely unsuccessful battle to regain and cardiovascular/aerobic strength. Thank you! Also wanted to mention that if you are a Mac woman, you could try iTunes.  They let you my movies, TV shows, etc., but they also let you rent them, usually for $3.99. Just a thought. Also, you said you still don't have any answers about the dryness of your skin.  One possibility, as I'm sure you know, is medication or even supplements. And I'm just going to mention one, that may be really off the wall.  Sjogren's Syndrome. It's an autoimmune disease that attacks the exocrine glands that secrete fluids, such as salivary glands, tear glands, resulting in dry mouth and dry eyes and several other things. Some people get a dry cough because of the limited saliva; sensitivity to light, air or smoke, dry, itchy skin, dry, cracking lips. And also some other things that you wouldn't really think of for a disease that is basically about dryness, like nausea, joint pain, morning stiffness, yeast infections, bladder infections, cold sores and stomach pain.  There's more, but I don't remember.  Oh, but one of the big symptoms is increased thirst and drinking large amounts of water.  Oh, and teeth problems, most especially more frequent cavities, but not limited to that.  This may be totally out of the ball park, but I couldn't help thinking about it as you've been describing some of the things that have been going on for you lately.  It might just be worth asking about, especially if you have any personal or familial history of autoimmune problems.  And sorry to say it, but some cancer researchers believe that chemotherapy can disrupt the immune system enough to cause autoimmune problems. One other thing, Lizzy, I have a lip treatment that I get from a medical supply store/ compound pharmacy.  After trying what feels like every lip balm on the regular market, I have fallen in love with this stuff. The place is about 30 minutes from my house, but I will do the drive to get it. It's made by Medline, and it's just called \"Remedy\". Or maybe the whole name is \"Remedy Phytoplex Lip Balm\". I don't know what's different about it except that it is petroleum-free. You could check online for it, or call around to medical supply places or compound pharmacies. Or if you can't find it, I will get you some and mail it to you! Offer stands for anybody! I'm off to the bank now, because yesterday I found just under a thousand dollars in fraudulent charges from someplace called \"foreclosurefrees.com.\" Never been there, never heard of it, never visited any sites whatsoever about forclosures.  But now I have to go close our account, open a new one, and re-establish all of my automatic debits and internet bill pays.  One thing I learned when I was there yesterday is about online bill paying that I didn't know.  They said if you pay, let's say your car loan online, and you signed up for automatic debit with your lender. So once a month they debit your checking account for the amount of your monthly payment.  Well, my bankers told me that is a dangerous thing to do.  However safe your lender might be, you have put your account information in cyber-world.  The lender might enforce all kinds of privacy/security tools, but your info is still out there for anyone to find (if they're smarter than I am). So my bankers said the better wayf to do it, and the only safe way, is to set up your automatic payments through your bank, so that your lender never has your info, nor does anyone in cyberspace. Istead, your bank automatically pays your lender your monthly payment.  It is sent from your bank, rather than pulled from the lender.  Just thought y'all might want to know. BTW, my goal for tomorrow, or maybe later today is to write a post that is actually shorter than my dissertation! ",

Debbi: I think meditation is a great idea.  Rachel mentioned mindful meditation, and I would recommend that.  There are many, many kinds of meditation.  Some religious in nature, some to focus the mind, some, to relax the body, some to remuinate on problems, etc.  Mindful meditation seeks to empty your mind, to try not to think at all.  As thoughts do pass through your mind, you just acknowledge them, and let them go.  Or if there is a sensory change in you or around you, for, example, you would again just acknowledge it, \"Yes, there is a breeze I can feel on my skin\" And then let it go.  It might sound very strange, but it can be very helpful.  The idea is to go in with no expectations.  Yes, you try to relax, but the goal is to mindful, which is to take note of your experiences, physical and mental, acknowledge them, one at a time, with no one thought having any more power over another (you can see how that might be helpful). Being mindful of what is going on in your head and in the world around you, and rather than reacting emotionally, you let your mind see it, be mindful of it, and then let it go. Tex: So sorry about your pain! And so sorry for you and me and everyon here, that when we are bothered by anything physical, we will, at some point or in some way, inevitably need to worry about it, get scared by it, and eventually, make sure it's not cancer.  That said, I'm glad your pain isn't cancer!   As for the lifting, I think its great.  There are certainly people here with more experience with lifting than I have, but please make sure to work on strengthening your core muscles before or as you work specifically on your back muscles.  Sometimes back pain is actually caused by weak core muscles. Lizzy: yep, same stuff.  Forgetting things from my keys to my birthday! Doing things differently, not by conscious choice, but by accident.  I spell things wrong or forget how to spell (a lot of times when i'm writing, I switch letters around and put thim in different order). I often can't think of words. And I HATE when other woemn say to me, \"Well it's all just part of getting older.  I kmow when I went through menopause...\" I don't need to say any more, because I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. Well, I just ran out of time.  Love to you all! ",

Omaz: I'm very happy to hear that your friend is doing better.  Especially glad to hear that they're going to start weaning her off the respirator, because, based on my limited knowledge of the disease, it is usually usually either dysautonomia or pulmonary complications that can be fatal, so I take it as a good sign that they believe it is safe for her to start breathing on her own again.  That's good news! Do they have any idea how her sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous systems are working, or if there is damage there?  I also know that the paralysis or semi-paralysis of the autonomic nervous system can and often is reversible.  I am hoping and praying for the best. Sptmm: Sorry if I sounded too abrasive or nasty.  My friends aren't the ones that say things like that, and I do understand that people are well-meaning; it's just hard to hear sometimes.  I guess I was just venting a little, but I'll be more careful about how I say thingsI really don't mean to offend. Oh, and just FYI, I'm not in menopause now, and it wasn't brought on by chemo.  I've been post menopausal since I was 33. As for the truncal lymphedema, you're right that your doctor is wrong.  There is most definitely such a thing as truncal lymphedema.  And, please, if you think you have it, get yourself to a physical or occupational therapist who specializes in LE.  If LE is treated early, it stands a much lower chance of getting worse. And remember, LE can occur or flare up from something as innocuous as a mosquito bite, so if you do everything you can now, you will thank yourself later.   Good luck with the meditation. Tex: I too am very glad you're getting a second opinion.  Clearly you know that the fusion surgeries and \"filler\" approaches can end up putting the patient in more pain than they were already in.  One of the problems with seeing OS's is that they are surgeons.  Very good surgeons, but still surgeons, which all too often means they look for surgical treatments where non-surgical treatments might be better for the patient.  I might even consult a chiropractor or a physical therapist who specializes in back/neck injuries.  I've known people who have had surgery for ruptured disks and done fine, some who have been worse off for it, and some who sought other kinds of treatments and did well.   Yeah for you on the bio tes!! Rachel: I don't know what your son looks like, but I can just see him sprinting happily past all the \"old people\" and still being able to run home! Pretty cool! Lizzy: Thanks for the info on lifting.  I'm going to keep ahold of that for myself.  To tell you the truth, I've never really done any serious lifting, but I'd like to.  Mostly to help my running.  Running is much better and safer if you have a strong core and back. Also I'd just like to be leaner, and stronger. It seems like chemo has taken so much muscle tissue and muscle strength.  I want to get it back.  I've always prided myself on being strong for my size.  I remember one time about two years ago, when I was at work with my husband on some film shoot, and he and two of his assistants were trying to lift this very heavy treadmill that they use basically to move props smoothly across some backdrop or something, onto the back of my dh's truck.  My dh is a big guy, strong, one of the other two guys was pretty slight, and the other was pretty normal, probably fairly strong.  Anyway, they couldn't lift it high enough to get it over the bump on the inside of the lift gate.  Brian said they needed to quit because he is very careful not to let anyone on his crew get injured.  So they went away, and I went up to Bubba (that's what we call each other), and asked him to let me give it a try.  He said he thought it was too heavy and he didn't want me to hurt myself.  I told him that I know how to lift things to avoid injury, and that if it did feel too heavy I would quit.  So, guess what, the two of us had it in the truck in less that a minute.  Sorry for the long story.  I'm not trying to show off. I guess I'm just kind of reminiscing about what my body used to be capable of, not to mention running marathons.  Anyway, my point ir really just that I want to do everything I can to get that strength and endurance back.  I know it may not ever be the way it was, but I plan on getting as strong and as fit as I can. Lizzy, thanks too for asking about how I'm doing and about the LE. The answer to the first is not very well, really.  But I'll fill you in later when I haven't already gone on so long.  LE is still a daily struggle.  Hope everyone has a great day!    ",

On the day of my first Tx, I went to fill my meds, and my insurance wouldn't cover Emend without pre-approval from my onc.  Of course, by the time I got to my pharmacy, it was late in the day, so it took another day until I could get it settled.  My insurance has very good drug coverage, and despite all the meds I'm always on for various things, this had never happened to me before.  So it might be worthwhile to check it out.",

I want to say thank you again for all the support you all have given me throughout my dog's illness and eventual death. It has been hard for me to talk on the phone with friends and family about it, because I just get too upset, but I have found myself coming here, to my cancer support group, for words of compassion and understanding about the loss of my sweet Bixby.  Bet y'all didn't know you'd be offering pet grief therapy when you signed onto this list.  But you all seem to understand how this loss and my cancer experience have become intwined, each one making the other one harder.   I am doing a little better today.  At least I've been able to keep my crying to only when I am at home, and not at the checkout line in a store or at the library.  Also able to get together with a friend for coffee.  (Well I guess I cried a little then. Oh well. ) But, although my chemo Tx yesterday went fine, I've been surprised to begin feeling side effects so soon after.  I am experiencing more nausea, more diarrhea, more muscle pain, and more headaches today,  on Day 2 than last time.  Last time, all I felt was tired all day, a backache, and about six hours after the Neulasta shot, I began to feel the bone pain.  So this has me scared about that whole cumulative thing we keep referring to and reading about.  I guess I had just assumed it would just be a little harder each time; now I'm beginning to fear that it will be a lot harder each time.  Someone please say something to help me stay in the present, and not the unknown future! BTW, I was at a store this afternoon, with a small cap on, and some kind-of-neutral-kind-of-feminine-looking clothes.  As I passed through the sensors on my way out the alarm went off, and the employee who was watching the registers (it was a self checkout line) and the doors, called out, \"Excuse me sir, could you come this way?\"  Then, once I'd turned around to face her, she stared for about five seconds, then said, \"You're okay. Have a nice day.\" and I went back through the doorway, with the alarm still sounding, and headed toward my car, just kind of chuckling to myself. Best wishes to all. ",

I did manage to take my dog for a walk today.  As you all know our other dog, Bixby, died recently, and Marlow, our other one, has been acting very depressed since then.  He doesn't want to play.  He's afraid of our backyard.  He's not eating.  And he vacillates between sticking to me like glue and hiding out in an unoccupied room staring out the window.  He's usually a high-energy, attention-seeking, youthful pup, but he's obviously in distress.  We don't usually walk our dogs b/c they get plenty of exercise in our backyard, but I've started walking Marlow every day since Bixby died to give him extra fun and attention and distract him from his sorrow, so I don't care how bad I feel, I consider this an extremely important responsibility. Good vibes to everyone! ",

Made my weekend a lot easier.  My best friend had a seizure on Friday (probably from a medication she's on), so it's been busy.  At the hospital with her all day Friday (I actually beat the ambulance there), keeping in touch with her family members, and since she can't drive, taking her places.  She's doing ok, though. I have a question for the group that's really important for me.  As you know, I've been trying to decide between 4 and 6 tx's of TC, and my onc isn't being very helpful.  She gets irritated when I ask to talk to her about it.  Last week, when I brought up the issue, she pretty much said, \"I thought we'd already been through this.\" She says that because TC x 6 isn't on the NCCN Practice Guidelines, she won't give TC times six, that it is a rule in her practice, but two of her nurses have told me that sometimes they do give TC x 6.  And when this first came up, before I started chemo, my onc had said that six Tx's would be a good solution for me, but that she was still recommending 4 tx's.  So my questions are: have any of you been given a choice between 4 and 6 tx's of TC (not TCH)? and have you had any trouble getting insurance to pay for six tx's?  My onc told me that because TC x 6 isn't on NCCN Guidelines, she doubted if my insurance would cover it, but I don't see how that can be true since so many women get six tx's.  My onc has a bit of an ego, and doesn't really like to be questioned, and I'm wondering if she's being totally straight with me.  She gets irritated if I bring it up, and last week pretty uch told me, \"I thought we'd been over this already.\" For instance, if her nurses are right and she does give TC x 6 in some cases, why lie about it? Or hide it from me?  Why not tell me that, yes in some cases they do use tc x 6, but explain to me why she doesn't think it would be appropriate in my case (even though in the beginning she said she did think it was appropriate)?  And why tell me insurance probably wouldn't pay for it, when other onc's prescribe it for their patients, and I haven't heard of those patients having insurance problems with it. Anyway, I just am not comfortable with the responses I've gotten from my onc about this, and while my tumor wasn't that big, my pathology report contained some pretty ominous prognostic features (that everyone has agreed on), so I want to do whatever makes me feel the most comfortable with the treatment I get, so that down the road if I have a recurrence, I won't look back and wonder if it could have been avoided if I'd had those two extra Tx's.  And I don't want this doubt hanging over my head. I know at some point we have to trust our doctors, but that's hard to do when your doc tells you she thinks this at one point, and then denies it later, and when she tells you one thing and her nurses tell you another. So if any of you have been given the choice, could you please tell me about that? And those of you getting TC x 6, how did that get decided, and have you had any insurance issues around it? I would really appreciate hearing about your experiences and any advice as soon as possible since, if I'm going to do anything about this, it will have to be soon.  Thank you, dear friends. ",

Lizzy: I have been post-menopausal for six years now, so I don't have pain association with a cycle, but I can tell you that a few weeks ago, I was having pain in the ovarian area on my right side, where I have in the past had ovarian cysts.  Fortunately, I was scheduled that same week for my yearly pap test, and my gyne did an ultrasound because she said upon examination my uterus was very deviated to the left side.  She said that would usually be caused by a tumor or possibly a cysts. Actually, I had to come back a few days later for the ultrasound, which was a little nerve-wracking, but in the end, it was nothing bad.  She said she didn't see any signs of a tumor, and not even a cysts.  What she saw instead was a lot of inflammation spread throughout the whole area, bowels, etc.  No blockages or anything, just inflammation.  She said she was sure it was the chemo causing the inflammation, thereby causing the pain.  She said it was not unusual and would resolve on its own once chemo was over.  May not apply to your situation, but, on the other hand, it may.  I would strongly encourage you to see your gyne, not just your onc, about it so s/he can do an ultrasound and hopefully put the issue to rest. Zachsmom: I'm glad to hear you started on Effexor.  I just wanted to let you know, though, that Effexor (based on many experiences with it) does not necessarily act quickly.  It may take a few weeks and a few dose increases before you feel the full effects.  I've been on Effexor before several times for my Bipolar Disorder, and it has been a good drug for me, very few side effects.  But you doc, no doubt, started you on a low dose because it has to be titrated up somewhat slowly, and you may very well need more than just a low dose to bring you real relief.  I don't know if part of the reason for choosing Effexor was to help deal with nightsweats, which it does very effectively, but especially for nightsweats, you may need a larger dose.  I am now on 300mg, and yes, it has helped my mood and energy level (Effexor has a stimulant effect), it is just now at this dose really making a difference with hot flashes and nightsweats.  So be patient, but know that you are on the right track! Just my two cents. Calamty: Have you tried the cucumbers in your water yet? Found out yesterday that I have a virus (or maybe I told y'all this already), and my pain and nausea are off the charts.  Plus, the taxotere tends to give me diarrhea, but with all the anti-emetics I'm having to take, I'm swinging back toward the constipated side. UUUGGGHHHH! And my husband, who you may remember, has been on a very long commercial shoot in Indianapolis (I'm in Chicago) for three weeks now was planning on coming home this weekend, but now he can't.  There is a bad cold floating around the whole crew.  He says, it seems like three out of four people around him seem to have it, and while he is very vigilant about using hand sanitizer and other precautions, it's just not worth the risk of his coming home and giving it to me.  Oddly enough, the commercial he is working on (he's and Art Director and Set Designer), is for a huge hospital system in Indiana, and they're using actual medical personnel instead of actors, so he's sought the advice of docs and oncs who have unanimously said, don't go home.  Heavy sigh.  My house is out of control, and my dog, Marlow, who is still heavily grieving the loss of our other dog, Bixby, is not getting the attention or exercise from me that I am usually able to give him.  I was so looking forward to having Brian (or Bubba, as we call each other -- being from Oklahoma and all) around to help pick up some of the slack for a few days.  Alas, no such luck.  And of course my best friend is still in the hospital, so I don't really have much in the way of help.  Also my therapist, whom I see twice weekly, left town last week for a conference until next Friday.  So I'm pretty bummed.  I'm considering getting some in-house help, at least for cleaning, because a good friend of ours is visiting next weekend, and though I know he would understand the house being in such disarray, it would horrify me to have any guest right now.  My hesitation is that there is just so much clutter, and so much that needs to be done, I don't know if someone from the outside would be able to do it.  Don't they usually just come in to do the more superficial stuff like cleaning bathrooms and dusting and doing floors?  I'd welcome any advice.  I just wish we had more friends close by.  We don't have children, so we don't have that automatic circle of friends that comes with kids, and while we have a lot of friends, and very dear friends, they are spread out across the country.  No family in the area.  Suggestions? On a positive note, my immediate family lives in Texas now, and have become huge Texas Rangers fans.  My dad is 77, not in very good health, but still very clear-headed and as funny as the day is long, and just a wonderful, cheerful, makes-everybody-happy kind of guy.  He used to play ball when he was younger, and his first career was as a high school teacher and baseball coach.  But he's never been to a World Series game.  When he was a boy, he and his brothers and sisters would help his Papa in the cotton fields after school, and then Papa would practice baseball with my dad (none of the other brothers were interested).  It was a very special bonding experience for them.  Papa taught him how to hit, field, how to through a curve ball.  Dad was a great pitcher. And every evening, as they were finishing up, Papa would put his arm around my dad's shoulder and say, \"If the Cardinals ever make it to the world series, we'll be there!'  I don't know why the Cardinals were his team, and I don't know how he ever thought he could afford it, because he was basically a sharecropper/farmer, but it was his mantra.  Anyway, the night before last, my sister and I while she was driving around at work and I was on my computer at home, bought World Series tickets for San Francisco at Texas Rangers, for her, my brother-in-law, my niece, and my dad.  It will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for him.  I wish I could go, but obviously can't.  But I am thrilled beyond words for my dad.  When my sis stopped by his and my mom's house that night to tell him, at first he was completely speechless.  Leslie said, \"Now Dad, there not the best seats. They're pretty high, but they have a good view of first base.\"  My Dad said, \"Les, I would take a phone book and sit on a flagpole to watch this game!\" Then he got very tearful as he told her stories about him and Papa playing baseball on the farm as a boy.  I'm crying now just thinking about it.  My sis was nervous about spending so much money, but I told her I would split it, and I said, in a few months you'll forget about the money, but you'll remember this game and how much it meant to Dad for the rest of your life. Just thought I'd bring a happy, though poignant story to our thread. Hugs to all. Whitney ",

And the majority of women with bc don't get Lymphedema, but I just want you to look into it a little while your thinking through this rad thing, because radiation does increase the risk of LE.  And doctors tend not to understand how much LE affects your life, in my experience.  Not that they don't care about it, but it's kind of like, well, it's not cancer, and it's not going to kill you, so... Anyway, I'm sorry to fill your head with more negative stuff than you already have to deal with.  I feel bad about even telling you all this. And I'm NOT saying this will happen to you if you do the rads in the axillary, but I just don't want you to make the decision without being informed of the risk.  I truly hope this is helpful.",

      "Content": "Nov 5, 2010 05:27AM wherria wrote: Good morning Chemosabes.  I wish I could say it was bright and early, but alas, these days I'm sleeping until about 3:00, and it is dark and early. sptmm: Yes, absolutely there are preventative exercises, and I'm surprised your surgeon didn't either go over some of them with you or send you to a therapist to do them.  As soon as my incision was healed my breast surgeon sent me to an occupational therapist, not just for LE prevention, but also to regain range of motion and strength.  Now I had a mastectomy, so maybe if you had a lumpectomy (I can't remember), you might not have needed this.  Either way, if you've lost any range of motion or strength you could use some occupational therapy, and especially if you had a bx, you could use some therapy to help you prevent LE.  You will need a doc's order for it (for ins.), so yes, I would definitely ask your surgeon or onc (I think it would usually come from your surgeon, but I suppose your onc would do it too) to refer you.  In my experience occupational therapists are better suited for LE prevention.  Some physical therapists do it, but PT's usually are shorter term and tend to treat more toward strengthening, regaining a certain range of motion and then discharging, whereas OT's will do more things like teaching you prevention skills, lymphatic drainage massage, and fitting you for compression garments.  Plus, they help you learn appropriate skills for getting on with activities of daily living taking LE risk or actual LE into consideration.  If you've had a mastectomy, you need to have at least a compression sleeve FITTED AND ORDERED BY A PROFESSIONAL NOT BOUGHT OFF THE SHELF, because even if you don't have lymphedema now, you still need a sleeve to wear when doing even mild to moderate exercise, to wear on airplanes, etc. in order to prevent LE.  An OT can do this (and some PT's) for you.  One thing it is very important to know (and again I don't mean to scare anyone, just giving facts) is that just because you show no signs of LE now, doesn't mean you're not still at risk for it.  It's an unfortunate fact for anyone who's had a mastectomy or rads to the axillary area (much less risk if all you've had is a lumpectomy, but it all depends on how much of the lymph system was removed or got disturbed during surgery or radiation).  LE actually doesn't tend to show up in the first few months after surgery or radiation.  It tends to show up a little further down the line.  This is why they warn us about protecting our affected limbs from cuts, scrapes, or burns; why they tell us to wear gloves while cleaning or gardening; and also why they tell us not to lift heavy objects with the affected arm.  It's all to prevent lymphedema.  Because, the sad fact is you could be doing fine for two years post-op, and then get a mosquito bite, or a little cut on your affected arm which might get infected, which could trigger lymphedema.  It sounds scary, and I'm sure 90 times out of a hundred a mospquito bite will not lead to lymphedema, but the risk is there that something like that could trigger it even years down the road. I've read that some patients can go ten years without it, and then have something trigger it even that much later. I'm saying all this because I have been profoundly affected by my LE, and I don't mind being the voice of caution, because I don't want any of you to have to deal with this.  Which means I hope everyone willl take the necessary precautions now in order to ward it off in the future.  Studies have  shown (now I sound like a commercial) that early intervention or treatment has profound effects on a person's likelihood to remain LE-free in the long run, or if LE is already present, to keep it manageable and prevent it from becoming a serious, chronic issue.  A big part of this is learning the techniques for prevention.  So even if you ask your doc, and for some reason s/he says, \"You don't need therapy -- you don't have lymphedema,\" I would say that you have heard and read that there is a lot to learn from therapists about preventing LE, that you understand that just because you don't have it now doesn't mean you're not at risk for getting it, and you want to do everything possible to prevent it.  That's probably way more than you wanted to hear on the subject, but, as you can probably tell, I'm pretty upset about what is happening to my body because of this, so I can get a little passionate about it.  So I hope I don't sound overbearing or hypochondriacal, just meaning to help. Texas: This will be over-simplified, but what usually determines if a person gets rads or not is whether they've had a lumpectomy or a mastectomy.  For the most part if you've had a lumpectomy, your doc will probably recommend radiation to make sure that there isn't any cancer left behind, or to kill off any pre-cancerous cells that might be hiding there.  If you've had a mastectomy, in most cases you won't need radiation.  There are some exceptions to that, however, like how close the cancer was to the chest wall, how many lymph nodes were involved, how aggressive the cancer was, and if there was any muscular invasion. In cases where those things are issues, rads might also be prescribed even after mastectomy.  There's probably more to it, but those are the basic guidelines. In my case, while my tumor wasn't in a particularly bad position, it did show signs of aggressiveness, and my onc told me it would be worth my while to get a radiation oncologist's opinion about rads, but when he saw my lymphedema, he said, \"never mind, you won't be a good candidate for radiation.\" I guess I've spilled enough for now. One last thing though.  Since you all were so supportive of me when my dog, Bixby, dies, I wanted to let you know that I have started looking for and talking to breeders about finding a new puppy.  We were hoping to have one by Christmas, but so far I've only found two breeders who will have litters ready to go to new homes in Feb., and one in March.  Still looking though, and I'll keep you updated.  We're only looking at one breed -- Bearded Collies. That seems to be our breed of choice, and they're rarer than most breeds. We're willing to travel, but only so far.  When we live in New York and got Bixby, we drove into Canada to get him, and when we got our second Beardie, Marlow, we were living here in the Chicago area and drove to Wisconsin.  Anyway, I wanted you all to know, that while I still miss Bixby horribly, as does my dh, we do feel ready to open our home to a new puppy, and to get a new little brother or sister for Marlow.

I've gained fifteen pounds since the beginning of chemo.  Everyone on my team is happy about it, because I was underweight to start with, but I'm not happy.  And with my lymphedema causing so much swelling, I feel like the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man.  And to top it off, I'm not allowed to do any kind of aerobic exercise at all because of the lymphedema.  I hate it!  I was determined to keep up my running -- knowing, of course, that it wouldn't be very much running, and much slower than usual -- throughout my treatments.  I was able to do it for a while, but then my arm started swelling, the my back, then my side, then my hand, then my boobless (that's what my dh and I call my mx side), so no ore running or even walking at anything other than a slow, leisurely pace.  My doc and my OT keep telling me that a lot of this is water, and that it will slowly go away once Tx is over, but I have three weeks in between Tx's and none of it even starts to go away in that time frame, so I'm skeptical. Had an out-of-town house guest this weekend.  We had a nice time, and it was wonderful to see her.  But she's going through a divorce and I wasn't feeling at my best, so it was a little low key.  But the really good news is that she accepted my invitation to come spend Christmas with us!  Yay!  I've invited my parents, but know yet if they are coming.  Either way it will be nice to have Terasa, and even nicer if we have my parents too! Final Tx is Wed. I'm definitely happy about that.  Hope everyone is having a nice weekend.  I know we're not all feeling that great, but even so, it's still possible to have some nice days.  Hugs to all.",

      "Content": "Aug 10, 2010 09:03PM - edited Aug 10, 2010 09:14PM by wherria Good morning ladies.  I hope everyone is going to wake up to a good day!   I'm not really sure how I'm feeling today.  I'm on Day 9 today, and to be honest, it's been pretty bad since Day 3.  I've told you all about the mouth sores, bone pain, muscle pain, diarrhea/constipation, yada, yada.  Did I mention I had a rash start several days ago?  Didn't think too much about it until yesterday when it started getting worse.  What was also getting worse were the muscle spams.  Not just muscle pain, but spasms that could really bring me down, literally.  The night before last I was walking up the stairs in my house with a plate of food in my hands.  Got about halfway up and my back started to spasm.  I didn't fall down the stairs, but sort of slowly down onto the step I was on.  I yelled for my husband, who came and grabbed the dish out of my hand and helped me the rest of the way up the steps.  It was just like my legs gave out because these spasms were making me sort of curl up.  So anyway, I called the onc's office yesterday, and they said to come in.  And...Voila! Shingles! They think.  Maybe.  They're not too sure.  Could be.  Maybe not, but take this anti-viral (Valtrex) and call if it doesn't get better.  Who knows, it might even help your mouth sores.  Okay, but what about this pain? I only got to see the nurse practitioner, but of course she talked to my onc about it while I was there.  I said, how about a muscle relaxant, like the one I was on last month when I had bronchitis?  Nope, onc isn't comfortable prescribing that for me because of the psych meds I'm on (I'm bipolar), but if I wanted to call my psychiatrist I could do that... He's out of town? Oh, shoot. Okay, how about a different pain med than the one you gave me last week, because it isn't helping? How about the one my surgeon gave me after my mx? Nope, onc's not comfortable with that either because of my other meds... you know without talking to my psychiatrist. But I was on the same meds.  And, oh yeah, did I mention my psychiatrist was out of town?  Shrug. It'll be okay. Just try this anti-viral and call us if it gets worse.   So, okay, I appreciate the fact that my onc. wants to stay on top of all of my meds, but surely there was more she could do than that.   I am not a pill seeker.  Don't like pain meds.  Don't like what they do to me.  But I was practically falling down the stairs for Pete's sake!  So I stopped at the pharmacy and got the Valtrex (the anti-viral), came home and took aforementioned pain med that I still had from the surgery, and got some relief, finally.  I don't like doing that.  I never want to go \"behind my physician's back.\"  I like to follow my physician's instructions.  I don't take meds that were prescribed for someone else or something else.  I don't recommend that anyone else do it either. I believe my physician(s) should know and approve of what I'm taking.  But I didn't know what else to do. I think my onc. is super cautious about prescribing things to me because I'm on other meds that she's not as familiar with.  And I get that.  I even appreciate that.  I just didn't know what else to do.  Anybody out there have shingles before?  Shingles hurt!  And when the nurse practitioner looked at the inside of my mouth she actually gasped and said, \"Good Lord, that's really severe!\" (Hand to God, that's what she said.) Anyway, enough complaining.  The good news is, I got some relief, got some sleep, discovered that Orajel and Anbesol work in my mouth as well as or better than the Magic mouthwash and the other gel stuff they gave me last week (It's called Gelclair, BTW, and it works fairly well, just too temporarily.).  So right now, my back hurts, but not as bad; the rash hurts; but my mouth feels a little better, enough that I am actually enjoying my lukewarm morning coffee with vanilla Ensure mixed in!  So, I don't know, I say, \"Yea for me.  Things are looking up.\"  Shingles or no shingles! What would you all have done? ",

I'm on Cytoxan and Taxotere.  The other option that I was given was AC→T (Adriamycin/Cytoxan followed by Taxol or Taxotere).  This one was ruled out in my case because I have a history of cardiac problems (mild though they were). If you're interested in learning about other Tx regimens, I would again recommend going to nccn.org to look at the Clinical Oncology Practice Guidelines. Calamtykel and Lizzy: Thanks for asking about the sores.  Yes, they are getting better. I have used all the rinses: the baking soda/saltwater rinse which I use very regularly (though that is more for overall oral hygiene than it is mouth sores, biotene which helps some, but doesn't have any analgesic, the Miracle Mouthwash which requires a prescription, and the GelClair which also requires Rx.  Each of these has helped a little, but they are not very long-lasting at all.  When it was at its worst and I felt like I had razor blades in my mouth and couldn't even talk, I tried regular old orajel and anbesol, and to my surprise they helped more than all the rest.  Took the pain away more completely.  Anbesol hurts going on, but then you are numb enough to swallow and drink. Lizzy: As for being thrown into menopause, I am already post-menopausal, so I will not be coming out of it after Tx, but from what I've read many women who are pre-menopausal before Tx do get their periods/fertility back afterwards.  However, the closer you are to being menopausal/peri-menopausal, the less likely you will come out of it post-Tx.  I am hoping for the best for all you ladies who are struggling and wondering about this issue.  I had to come to terms with my own infertility when I was 33, and I don't think that grief/sadness/loss will ever go away for me.  I never wanted anything more than to be a mother (and I am not a candidate for adoption because of a psychiatric history). So I am keeping not only your health and wellbeing in my prayers for you ladies, but your fertility as well. For those going through hot flashes, I can offer a few suggestions.  First, I would recommend asking your docs about taking a small dose of either Effexor or Paxil.  Both are anti-depressants (which many people find helpful as they go through CA Tx anyway), but beyond that, they have both been found to ease hot flashes.  Some other anti-depressants in the SSRI class may also be options -- these just happen to be the two that are generally the most helpful with hot flashes.  Also, watch what you eat before going to bed if you're having night sweats.  I found, and I've read of it also, that eating spicy foods or sweet foods or drinking alcohol in the evening can lead to more night sweats.  Nothing is more frustrating than having to wake up and change your clothes three times a night, or in the winter go stand outside three or four times a night, just to get some sleep! Jsw: I will echo everyone else's sympathy for how your Tx went (or didn't!).  I do hope that your doc can find a way to keep you on track and on schedule with your chemo regimen. Rachel: PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE do not be afraid to page whichever oncologist is on call over the weekend regarding your nausea.  It is what s/he is there for.  It is NOT a small matter.  It is a VERY legitimate reason to page the onc. All s/he would have to do is phone in another script for you, and your docs don't want you throwing up and becoming dehydrated and weak any more than you do.  Please get the help you need now, and don't wait until Monday.  There is no reason to wait.  There is someone available to help you, and that is his/her job!",

So not only am I heavier, but I'm shaped differently, and I am more fat than muscle for the first time in my life.  Anyway, I don't want to go on too much about it, but if you are struggling with the same thing, could you please let me know, and tell me how you're dealing with it. I am still giving my all to approach this disease and its fallout with positivity and gratitude that I am alive to deal with it.  I allow in the good moods, and fight against any negative thoughts (though the weight thing/body image is usually stronger than I am).  I am grateful to my doctors, my family, my friends, and to you, my chemosabes, even though I haven't been around for a while. I'd like to be back in the fold, though, and I have always continued to think about each of you. ",

Went to my GP today, because my onc wasn't very responsive when I told him about the liver enzymes being elevated, and the symptoms.  Well, actually, he didn't say anything, because he didn't call me back. His nurse did.  GP also did not order a complete liver panel, just a CMP, chest x-ray (??), head CT (??). I don't get it.  I have elevated liver enzymes AND symptoms that match liver disease/cancer.  Why am I having such a hard time getting someone to order a liver panel???? Lizzy: I'm a little frustrated with you, to be honest.  You are a warrior too, and we want to be supportive to you too, just as much as you want to be supportive to us.  I know I don't want to have a superficial relationship with you just because you are the one who started this group, and it would feel superficial if I knew that you were listening to me (us), but not telling me (us) about you.  If there are other reasons that you don't want to share your maladies, then that's a different story, and we will respect that, but what is the point of this group if we aren't ALL honest with each other?  That is, in fact, the commitment we have all made to each other.  Personally, I hate the thought, for example, that you might be writing strong, happy, supportive posts when, really, you aren't feeling strong or happy, or when you happen to be going through your own hell. So please, give this some thought, and give us the truth.  We love you, and you can't change that!!!",

Of course it was my doctor's office saying they had some results to give me.  That's when I started to shake.  You may remember that I saw my GP yesterday about all the symptoms I've been having and about the liver enzymes that were elevated according to labs my psychiatrist did last week.  (And Lizzy I am right with you on there needing to be an \"after chemo doctor\" who happens to know something about the shit we go through after chemo.  My onc also became very dismissive when chemo ended.) So I couldn't call back right away.  I needed to be more awake. I took the dogs outside, took a shower, and had a cup of coffee while staring at the old lab report.  Finally I got up the courage to call the doc's office back.  The first nurse I talked to, when I told her who I was, started looking for my report, then said, \"Okay I found it.  Um, Can you hold on for just a minute?\" Sure. The next nurse came on the line and said, \"Whitney.  We got your x-rays back, and they're clear.  There's no pneumonia.\"  Now, that might sound like nothing, a little good news.  But THEY HAD GIVEN ME THOSE RESULTS YESTERDAY! I am waiting on the lab results, which will indicate whether there really is something going on in my liver that needs to be explored! THAT\"S what I'm waiting on.  So I'm trembling, and more nervous than ever all becuase they called to give me news I already knew! What a way to start the day! It seems like we're all going through the same pain-in-the-ass thing.  All kinds of stuff wrong with us, weird things happening to our bodies, and doctors that either don't care about what's going on because it's not clinically interesting anymore, or don't understand how devastating their precious chemo is.  Maybe I sound a little over-rought, but come on! I have liver enzyme tests indicating that something  is going on in my liver; I have symptoms that very closely match the symptoms of liver mets, and I can't get any of my doctors to draw a liver panel to check it out! And in the meantime, I'm scared to death, partly because I am pretty darn educated when it comes to the body and medicine. No, I don't think I know more than my doctors do, but I know what liver enzyme tests mean; I know what the specific symtoms of breast CA mets to the liver are, and I also know what symptoms call for further testing! I'm spent! It doesn't make sense. Anyway thus ends my rant for the day. (Well, more might come later. I can't promise anything.:) Lizzy, I'm so glad you seem to have figured out what's causing all the dry skin and cramps and charlie horses, etc. I feel very relieved, and I'm sure you do too. By the way, you're right that AI's are used more often than Tamox for post-menopausal women, but I just want to mention that Tamox is used too.  There can be a variety of medical reasons for this, but of course, having a dismissive oncologist can be a reason too! Another thing, you're scaring me a little when you say you're drinking that much water and nothing else.  You could really be hurting yourself by doing that.  Not that water's not good for you, of course, but too much water can dilute your circulatory system so that the concentration of electrolytes in your blood will drop relative to the concentration of electrolytes in the cells.  This can cause hyponatremia and/or hypokalemia, which essentially means that all the water you're excreting through your kidneys is taking with it vital stores of sodium and potassium.  Sorry to go on if you already know all this, but it's very dangerous, because it can disrupt the electrical signals that your muscles and your neurological system need.  When this happens your body tries to find a balance between the two, and water will seep into your cells from your blood, cause your cells to swell.  Eventually, this sweeling affects your brain causing elevated intracranial pressure.  Okay, Okay, I'll stop.  Except for one last thing.  Hyponatremia (low sodium levels) can also cause musle cramping.  Nope, one more thing, and I don't mean to sound lecturey here, but drinking more water than your body needs also increases your total blood volume which puts extra strain on your circulatory system, including your heart and blood vessels, and also on your kidneys because they then have to work harder which can cause damage to the capillary beds that are responsible for filtering fluids through the kidneys.   Sorry folks.  When I get started talking about physiology stuff I can't stop myself.  The point, Lizzy, is please don't just drink water.  Drink Gatorade or Pedialyte.  That's all. Lizzy, I shouldn't have said that you were frustrating me.  I was just trying to get across how strongly I felt that it's important for you to share your stuff, feelings and all, with us.  I understand you and Tex, when you say you don't feel comfortable being that open, but I hope you both will try, because it helps.  And we want to know that you are getting all the benefits of this group that the rest of us are.  Of course I don't want you to feel uncomfortable, but neither do I want for you to hold back just because you are our leader.  We can take it! And think for a moment.  Hasn't it actually done you some good lately to share your frustration and your fears with us?   Okay folks, I gotta go, and I hope I haven't frustrated you all with my rambling! Have a godd day, everyone.  I love you all! ",

Lizzy, It's probably too late, and you've gotten lots of good advice about your poison oak, but I'll just reiterate that my husband really had good results with calomine lotion, although I think Omaz's idea about benadry spray is a good one.  At least until you can get a cortisone shot.  Good luck1 It's funny.  I don't have the same reaction about the pink ribbons.  The breast cancer awareness and product contributions have made breast cancer the most researched type of cancer, and even though I know a lot of it is just crap to persuade people to buy the yogurt with the pink ribbon on it instead of the other kind, I also think that without this \"movement\" we wouldn't have had the anti-emetics during chemo that our mothers didn't have, or the aromatase inhibitors for post-menopausal women that our mothers didn't have or the neulasta shots (damn those things!). I definitely see your point, and I hesitate to wear the pink hats and the shirts with ribbons, but that's because I don't necessarily want to go around announcing that I have cancer, any more that I would want to go around wearing a shirt that says, \"I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.\" Anyway, just my take on things.  Still, I do understand the frustration. The ones I feel sorry for are the ones with rare blood cancers, or pancreatic cancer, stc. whose diseases are virtual death sentences partly because they have not been researched as much and don't have have many treatment options. The point about the pharmaceutical companies profitting off of the illnesses they are supposedly interested in treating is definitely not lost on me.  Sure they need to profit in order to stay in business, but we all know how excessive their income is, and their bonuses, etc.  And we all know how they manipulate the population with advertising that makes people think that becaue threy saw an ad for Abilify in Good Housekeeping, it must be the answer to all their problems, so they go to their doctors and say, \"I'd like you to prescribe me some Abilify!\" Which is why I so strongly I can't even find words, that direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals should absolutely be illegal, as well as the incentives from pharma reps to doctors to use their drugs, and the fact that docs get their required continuing medical education credits from the companies that stand to profit from these doctors, and the fact that these CME's, you know, just happen to be scheduled it Hawaii or aboard Alaskan cruise ships!  Actually, I better stop here, because I could go on for a very long time about Big Pharma, and all the unethical, and sometimes illegal problems in our health care system, the American one anyway. Thanks, Lizzy, for the cheers about my own devious navigation of the health care system.  And yesterday it worked.  I went back to medical records and requested my most recent labs.  Got them no problem.  A good thing too, since none of my doctors bothered to call me with the results.  But here's the kicker.  Remember how I talked to my onc and told him that even though they were only slight elevations, I was also having symtoms, and was scared about whatever might be going one, and asked him repeatedly to run a complete liver panel? And remember that he said yes, he would order a liver panel.  Well, the f***er didn't order a liver panel.  He ordred the same chem 7 that my GP had ordered, and the same chem 7 that my psychiatrist had ordered. So after begging my doctors for 2 weeks now to order a simple, inexpensive, run-of-the-ill blood test, and being out and out lied to by my onc, I am going to find a GI specialist and call on Monday and beg them to get me in as quickly as possible.  I am beyond frustrated. I am beyond trust. And I am most definitely beyond this oncologist!!",

This is the fourth doctor visit I've had with basically the same symptoms.  The only thing that's different is that it has gotten harder yo breathe.  Anyway, he ordered an ultrasound of pancreas, gall bladder and liver.  I've had three chest/abdomen x-rays, a head ct, an abdominal ct, and countless labs in the last month and a half, and its still a mystery.  Well, its not a total mystery.  We know that the problem is either in one of those three organs, or it's pleurisy that, for some reason, is not showing up well on the images.  But my doc today said that I'm to the point where he doesn't want to expose me to anymore radiation.   I asked him if he was thinking cancer, and he said, \"I'm looking for it.\" He said that with my history it's got to be the first thing to look for, but he just doesn't know yet.  It's kind of weird to say this, but the best-case scenario is a gall bladder attack or gallstones.  Oh well.  Too many things happening this week from my head to my liver.  Husband out of town now for two weeks, and will be for another two weeks.  Can't really handle this.  ",

First of all, you have to meet my Dad.  He is the kindest man you will ever meet, funny, and everybody loves him.  Makes friends wherever he goes. (For instance, in Ft. Worth, where my family lives, my mother, who is also wonderful, but a total couch potato, lives on fountain drinks from the local Qhuick Trip, so Dad goes about four times a day to get them for her.  The employees at Quick Trip never charge him for the Cokes, or anything else he buys there either, just because they love him so much.  In return, every month or so, Dad brings them a pizza.) Anyway, the other thing about my dad is that he is very laid back.  Takes things as they come, mellow. So the evening my sister and my ex-boyfirend, who also rode a bike, decided to teach me to drive. I was about fifteen.  So we're outside on our street, and they tell me what's what, how to start, shift, break, everything.  I already knew how to drive a standard car, so the idea of shifting wasn't new to me.  (I learned how to drive at about 9 or 10, and was driving myself around town to choir, soccor, etc. by 13.) So it's time for me to give it a try.  Their encouraging words did not conceal the anxiety I could see in their eyes.  Meanwhile, Dad is standing farther back on the porch with a drink in his hand, not participating, or saying a word, just watching. So, I stir up my courage, although I was much more confident about my abilities than anyone else in the scene! I start 'er up, with helmet of course, and start down the street.  But when I say start, what I really mean is I stepped on it, cannonballed, ripped, flew, with no cognitive ability to remember that a bike had breaks!  My sis and boyfirned are running down the street behind me, screaming, \"STEP ON THE BREAK! STEP ON THE BREAK!\" Finally, after about ten or fifteen seconds of my life flashing before my eyes, I remembered how to slow down, and miraculously came to a safe stop.  After walking the bike back to our house, and after a few minutes of catching our breath and eventually laughing about what a great biker I was, we looked to the porch to see if Dad was okay.  He said nothing, had clearly not moved from his spot, seemed unmoved.  Then he nodded his head, turned silently and walked back into the house. That was it! That was my first day of driving a motorcycle.   I did eventually learn to drive, and enjoyed it after that. But everyone agreed that my first try, given my dubious talents at other, similar tasks, was not a surprise, just one more for the books!",

Secondly, I might just take you up on your offer for investment advice.  I have a very small retirement fund through my former jobs in the ministry with TIAA-CREF and would love to borrow some of your wisdom.  My husband is in some kind of pension plan and annuity plan with his work.  But he works freelance, and his stuff is through his union, and we don't even know if he is fully vetted yet, and frankly, I don't even understand how the plan works (unions can be complicated!). Thirdly, a long time ago, when you first got your surgery date, I put it in my iphone calendar, which is the one I live by, with an alarm and everything to wake me up at 4:00 a.m. and spend some time \"with you\" in my heart.  BTW, I have done this for each of you, with every scan, surgery, significant appointments, etc.  I do this early in the morning, especially for surgeries because so often you are already in pre-op by 4:00 or 5:00, and also because it helps keep you (all) in my thoughts all day.  So, Lizzy, tomorrow, if you are lying on a bed or gurney that early in the morning, know that I will be awake and with you, inasmuch as I am able. (And if you know more about your schedule, please let us know). At any rate, I am very happy for you that you have finally arrived at this, well, benchmark, I guess.  I am keeping my hopes high, not just for tomorrow, but also that this surgery will, in fact, mark the turning point in your cancer experience that you are hoping for.  Good luck, my friend! You have a huge community of people who care about you, and tomorrow, you will occupy many many thoughts and prayers! We all love you! Omaz: I am so happy to hear that your friend (what is her name, by the way?) is making such strong progress! She does indeed sound like she is a very determined woman.  As you have related her story here, I expected her time in rehab (inpatient) to be much longer.  I don't know if I was just wrong about that or if she has thankfully surprised everybody at her (relatively) speedy progress.  At any rate, I am happy for her, for you, and everyone else who has been affected by this.  I understand that she has a long way to go, though, and am glad she has your strength and friendship to continue to count on! Ginger: It was so nice to hear from you.  I have been wondering about you and how you've been doing. I hope you continue to stick around or at least pop in from time to time.  I too was away for quite a while, but I have found in coming back, that this group is every bit as important and meaningful to me as it has always been. Sweeney: Whew! What a whirlwind, huh? I hope you're having a good time with your travels and aren't too exhausted.  I can't imagine the jetlag! I was thinking about you a few weeks ago because I discovered, by pure chance, The Children of Agape.  If you haven't heard of them, they are a group of South African children who live at the Agape House, which is an orphanage in S. Africa, home primarily to children who have been orphaned by AIDS.  You all may have heard of them because Paul Simon, Bono, and others made a documentary about the children there who had formed an utterly amazing choir, all through the inspiration of one little girl named, Slindile.  They have produced two amazing CDs, the best and most known being, \"We Are Together\" which is also the name of the documentary.  I have gotten completely enchanted with these children AND their music.  I have always been a huge fan of children's choirs from all around the world.  I have also always loved African music (the folk, native, gospel mostly), and while my husband has been in Indiana for about a month, I have used their music -- played very loudly, by the way -- to cheer me through some pretty rough days.  Anyway, I was just thinking about you since you were in Africa, and wondered if you were getting to experience much of the music there. Oh, also, I'm so sorry about your experience with Dr. Whatever in Winfield, but it jumped out at me because I LIVE in Winfield, less than a mile from the hospital.  I went there for half of my chemo Tx's before switching to the hospital system I go to now.  CDH is a great hospital, but I am sorry you got that quack.  Just out of curiosity, who was the surgeon who said she would have a \"conversation\" with him? Rachel: I wish you good luck with returning to full time work (officially).  You said you feel like you've been fulltime for a while already, and forgive me if I have missed the details of what your work schedule has been, but how much different is this change, and how is it going so far? Debbi: When I read about your uterine biopsy, I just shook my head, because, yes, this does seem like one of those medical procedures endured by women and under-estimated, in terms of how painful, scary and awful it is, by the medical community.  I am so sorry you had to have that done.  I haven't experienced exactly that procedure, which sounds like something out of Dante's third or fourth circle of hell, but I did have to have a uterine biopsy of the kind that Ginger described, and I can tell you that that was probably the most painful procedure I've ever experienced.  I was given no analgesic, and my doctor went in with this instrument that hurt just to look at it, and did what Ginger said.  It was kind of like this explosive hole punch that penetrated the uterine walls ( and in my case, beyond), to get a plug of tissue.  My doc had said that she was really sorrow to have to do it; that it was going to hurt A LOT, but that it would be over quickly. She was right, except it didn't work on the first try, or the second, or the third... I had been post-menopausal for a long time, and I barely had any lining left in my uterus.  It was so thin, that her instrument went right through the lining into the muscle, and still didn't come back with enough endometrial tissue for a proper biopsy.  So after four tries, she finally said she thought she had gotten enough tissue. I have a VERY high threshold for pain, and before that day, had never been scared of or all that affected by any medical procedure, but that was an indescribable ouch, multiplied.  I thought I was okay afterward.  She told me to stay lying on the table for a while, just in case.  The pain went away as soon as the \"hole punch\" was done; it wasn't a lingering pain, and this is what was weird about it, because, even though the pain was passed, my body was kind of in shock from it.  I lay there for a few minutes, then got up and got dressed.  I was very shaky, but I thought I was okay.  So I checked out and said goodbye. left the building, and before I got into the parking lot, I suddenly and violently threw up in the bushes outside the front door (yes, with people around to see).  I stood there to breathe for a second, then continued to my car.  Sat down in the driver's seat, and turned quickly to throw up again on the ground. Sat there for a long while, surprised that I was having this response, and finally started for home.  About ten minutes later, on a major highway, I had to pull to the side of the road to throw up again! Sorry for the long description, but, man! was it a bad experience.  The vacuum thing, well, I don't even know how to think about that! More later (if you can believe I still have more to say!).  Wishing you all a great day! And oh, by the way, GO RANGERS!!!!!!! ",

Cost a few bucks but I got my results! ",

Anyway, Texas, great point about how research findings from one cancer can end up helping with other cancers, and you're right about one drug tried on another cancer ending up being used for bc.  I wish I could remember which one, but I can't come up with it, and maybe there are more than one.  But I do know that during WWII, officers, I think Navy, who where exposed to musturd gas were found to have changes in their bone marrow, and around the same time, the US Army was experimenting with chemicals very similar to musturd gas, obviously to create \"better\" agents for war.  And in the process, they discovered nitrogen gas that eventually was found to be very effective against lymphoma.  That discovery developed into the creation of more effective cancer treatments called alkylating agents, from which most of us benefitted (cytoxan, F-5U, carboplatin, cisplatin).  So even instruments of war can end up leading to cancer treatments!   I highly recommend the book The Emperor of Maladies. Hope everyone has a good day! I'ts going to be rainy here, but it isn't yet.  It's just cloudy, so I'm going out to this forest preserve that has a wonderful array of different kinds of birds.  I've been learning about photography, and I'm getting a little better. Under cloudy skies, I should be able to get some really nice opportunities.",

Not to beat a dead horse (oh, God, what an aweful expression!), but I am pretty obsessed with the running thing. (Thanks for all the comments!) Lizzy, You're right that I tend to be a goal-oriented person.  I am, however, also realist.  One of the reasons I have to be goal-oriented is that with my bipolar, I can very easily, when I'm in a manic phase, take on way too many projects at one time, thinking that each one is the most important thing that's ever been done, and could possibly save the world.  I'm not really even exhaggerating (sp), and then when I'm in a depressive episode I tend to get very very low, like to the point of hospitalization (about 40 times), and my plans and their possible importance completey shatter.  So I feel like I must fiercely hang onto the goals that are truly important to me, or someone.  Running has always meant so much to me, and it is usually as important as or more important to my mental health as my medications.  Running has truly helped me grow as a person, recognize my own strengths and accomplishments, which is something I've never allowed myself.  It has provided a large and varied community.  Etc., etc. So, yes, I am very frustrated, and, I'll admit, angry with myself.  Cal, I admire your ability and strength to keep up your running during chemo.  I tried and tried, but I just couldn't breathe well enough.  I kept telling myself that the more I tried to run, the better my breathing would be, but it just didn't work out that way.   But, I have at least done a few healthy things recently.  I have started again without expecting too much out of myself.  I am not usually good with the patience thing, can't stand it when I am told, \"It's going to take time.\" It's kind of funny actually, and paradoxical.  Usually, when people talk about pushing themselves (in this context), they mean physically, making their bodies go just a little bit past what feels comfortable or doable.  For me, right now, pushing myself means forcing myself not to expect too much; forcing myself to allow my body time to regain its strength and readiness.  So that's a healthy thing. So I am running again, but I'm doing the run/walk technique -- I'll run for 3 minutes, then walk for 1, then run for 3 and walk for 1, etc.  Also, to satisfy my running obsession, I am doing other things, like reading running mags and blogs,etc, listening to running podcasts, looking aroung in running stores.  Doing those things helps me feel like I am still part of the running community; it helps me be hopeful and optimistic about what the future will hold, God willing. Adey, and Rachel: I like Lizzy's idea.  We can encourage and support each other.  In fact, Lizzy, you have led me to wonder if there would be any interest in a \"BC Rnners\" forum.  What do y'all think.  Im am starting a blog that will kind of chronical (sp?) my process of \"getting my body back\". There are a lot of people out there who are just beginning to run and having difficulty staying with it until it becomes enjoyable rather than just hard work, and people like me who are trying to return to running after a long layoff.  So this will be for them. BTW, as someone mentioned, there are other chemo drugs that can cause heart problems. In fact, if you read the small print, pretty much all of them have some amount of risk of heart damage.  Also, it is not just congestive heart failure that can happen.  There is also a high risk for cardiac aryhthmia, such as prolongated QT.  Much of the time these aryhthmias don't cause harm, but if they last lond enough or are severe enough, they can lead to a condition called Torsade de Pointes, which can lead to sudden death.   One last thing, and I will release you from the wherria prose prison! Adey, which Friday are the IL girls getting together, and thanks for the invitation.",

But, I'm staying motivated.  I'm staying positive, at least in terms of knowing I can do this.  And despite the tone of my last post, I really do like and respect my treatment team.  I feel lucky to have found my oncologist.  I think she is wonderful.  I just think she and her nurse practitioner could have handled the situation better yesterday, that's all. Oh and the other good news fro yesterday is that my counts were a little higher than they were on Fri.!  So... Gatineau: How are you doing with your first Tx? Se's okay? Zenith: Hooray for the good news!  English Teacher: I am holding out a lot of hope for you that you'll be able to train and do the races you signed up for! And if you have to walk some, it will still probably be one of your greatest victories! (BTW, what do you have to do to qualify for Nike Women's Marathon?  Is it like qualifying for Boston?) Janice: So I couldn't quite tell from your posts, do you still plan o doing the 1/2 marathon?  Which one is it? As far as keeping up with my running, what I have decided to do, is to do the best I can to be on some sort of training program while in Tx and once Tx is done, start the real training for my next marathon.  When I was diagnosed I put together \"My Treatment Book.\"  It's kind of like a scrapbook, with pictures, journal pages, stickers, affirmations, as well as medical/treatment info.  It's a fun project.  I recommend trying it for you creative types out there.  You can put as much or as little into it as you want.  Anyway, the back inside cover of mine has marathon pictures and slogans, etc. on it with a big arrow pointing out and the words \"Ready, Set, Go\" under it.) In the meantime, I volunteered through Network of Strength to be an aid station volunteer at this year's Chicago marathon in Oct.  That will be my marathon \"fix\" for this year, keeping me \"on course\" until I can get back into the race myself! Mmahle: You're on, what Day 5 now?  How is the muscle/bone pain? Sohard: You mentioned new side effects, but what are they?  Are you doing okay? lisaattheshore, AliceJean, Rachel, CindyRN, and JSW: How are you feeling as your Tx day approaches?  I will be thinking of you and hoping that all goes well.  calamtykel: Thank you for your prayers (and those from others as well -- you are all in mine too).  I guess you are still awaiting results of several tests, and I know you are struggling with a lot of anxiety. I'm very sorry.  The waiting Please let us know when you know something. Out of curiosity, what tumor marker test are they doing?  Lisasinglem: You said you've been trying to be positive but that you just needed to say that cancer sucks!  I don't think those two things are mutually exclusive.  Cancer does suck, and I think we can know that and be honest and real about how it sucks and still have positive attitudes.  And you know what, who says we have to have a positive attitude all the time?  It's okay to have bad moments, even to wallow a little bit, as long as we don't let it take control of us or how we think about our lives.  Cancer is a scary, grueling thing to go through, and you wouldn't be being honest with yourself or with us if you didn't allow yourself to experience the reality of that.  You're still doing a fantastic job of being strong and willing-to-take-this-on woman! Tina, I would say the same to you.  You're not being a downer when you tell us about the honest, painful struggle of this disease.  You are simply telling the truth.  There's a big difference between being truthful and open about that and being fatalistic or pessimistic.  You said that we all seem so confident and positive, and I do think that is what each of us is trying to do, and trying to help each other do, but that doesn't mean that we shouldn't talk about how painful or scary this is.  Talking about what you're going through and admitting to being scared isn't the same thing as giving up or not being willing to fight and do what it takes to survive.  It may be right and appropriate for us to encourage and support each other in this struggle, even gently to challenge each other a little bit in order to help each other be stronger, to be survivors, but we would do each other a huge disservice if we all put on fake smiles and pretended that everything was okay, or pretended that we aren't scared and sad.  I think that real courage and real strength come not from avoiding the truth of our situations out of some self-imposed guilt that tells us we shouldn't complain, or that by being open about what makes us tremble somehow makes us weak, or that it would sound like we have a negative attitude. Instead I think real courage and strength come from the ability to face our fears openly and honestly, talking about them, admitting to ourselves and others just how deeply they run, and then, armed with that truth and with the support we gain by doing that, turning our faces toward this disease and saying,\" I may be afraid, but I can still fight!\"  Maybe it sounds overly dramatic when I say it like that, but I am a strong believer that fear does not equal weakness.  And being real is not the same thing as being negative.   There's a great quote by the ancient Greek philosopher, Seneca, that, for me, makes the difference clear: \"It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare.  It is because we do not dare that things are difficult.\"  In this group, and in countless other similar groups, we are daring to take on this disease, to fight, to stay alive.  We may be afraid of this disease or this treatment, but that doesn't mean we are being cowardly or weak.  On the contrary, it just shows how much strength we really do have because, to borrow an earlier quote, we are showing up, and fighting the good fight.   Okay.  Enough pep talk.  Good luck to everyone for a good, hopeful day!",

I know what you mean about being careful not to assume every little slip of the mind or whatever is a result of chemo brain, and I will heed your warning, but part of my concern is because it was my friends and dh (Lisbeth, that stand for dear husband, just in case you didn't know that one), who started pointing it out to me, and they had never heard of chemo brain (I wish there was a different name for this!).  A few days ago, my best friend said she'd been noticing that I was forgetting the strangest things, and the kinds of things that wouldn't ordinarily be easy to forget, like when we met for coffee the other day at noon and she asked what I'd done all morning and I couldn't remember.  And my dh and other friends have said similar things.  I think there is a real brain thing going on here (not that you said there wasn't).  And I don't want to over-react, but I am a little nervous that it could become a problem in terms of day-to-day functioning.  I talked to my psychiatrist about it, and he was concerned because I'm on several meds, and have had some other treatments, that impair memory also.  So memory loss is already a medical issue for me.  He said it's not worth the risk yet of taking me off any of my meds, but he told me he wanted to keep a close eye on it.  And he said that because of my particular circumstances, I might be more prone to chemo brain and/or if I do experience short-term memory loss, it could potentially become a permanent problem for me.  I was relieved that he took it seriously since some docs don't even agree that this is a real phenomenon, but I wasn't consoled by how concerned he was.  He's not usually this open or explicitly cautious about things.  Before I started chemo, while I was reading about se's and stuff, I admit, I kind of blew that one off, thinking that if the medical community couldn't even agree if it was real or not, then maybe at the very least it couldn't be that bad.  But it's got my attention now.  ",

Anyway, I hope you can take hope from that and go into your Tx's feeling confident and as unafraid as possible.  Really, the infusion is the easy part, though, because it is a first and there are so many unknowns, it certainly can produce a lot of anxiety.  I tried to go in simply expecting that everything would be fine, that everything would make sense to me, that everyone there would be nice.  And it all turned out that way. Welcome to Thisishowilive! I'm sure you've heard this a million times, and will a million times more, so sorry if it's getting old, but I am sorry you are having to deal with this at such a young and important age.  There is so much going on in the life of any 18-yr-old, it's gotta be extremely rough to \"take time out of your life\" right now to deal with cancer.  I wonder if, even though you're taking some leave time from school, if they would allow you to, for instance go there on the days you were feeling up for it, and say, have lunch with your friends, or just stop by and say hi to your favorite teachers, or anything like that.  It might help you feel less lonely and more connected to your friends.  The hardest part, I think, of taking time off, whether it's school or work, is the isolation.  I'd say whatever you can do to stay connected and involved with your usual group of friends and supporters, the happier you will be.  No doubt, though, that we will be here for you! Re. second opinions.  I got second and third opinions.  As I told you all very early on in this thread, my treatment decisions -- well not the surgery decisions, those were pretty straightforward, whereas my chemo decisions were anything but straightforward.  I actually ended up getting four opinions.  First I went to the onc. that my surgeon, whom I loved and respected immeasurably, and she made two preliminary recommendations, one more preferred than the other, but said that there were some challenging aspects to my cancer that made the decision less than clear cut and that she wanted to do some thinking and consulting about it.  I hadn't had the Oncotype test done yet then either, so she ordered that.  So, while she was consulting with some of my other docs (for other med. issues), I went to a very high-ranking cancer center to hear their recommendations.  I won't bore you with the story, but for a variety of reasons I ended up seeing two different onc's there at different times, one before and one after the Oncotype results were in.  They both recommended the same Tx (without having consulted each other).  Went back to the first onc., who now had the Oncotype score, and she gave me the same two recommendations she had in the first place only switched in order of preference.  But she was willing to use either, and left the decision up to me. I chose the more aggressive one.  She still had concerns though, and said she would be presenting my case to a tumor board along with my surgeon the following week.  After that happened, she came back only recommending one option, and it was not the option that I had preferred or that we had spoken the most about.  So I was flummoxed. I really loved this doctor for a number of reasons and wanted to work with her, but I because of how things had unfolded, I really had my mind trained on the Tx option she had now rejected. So I told her I would take a few days to think about it and get back to her.  (She was very patient and understanding, and she recommended that I visit another oncologist, saying, \"This is what I'm recommending, but you are the one who has to feel confident about the Tx you're getting.  Do what you have to do to get that confidence.\" So I did go to another doc.  I felt lucky to be able to get in with someone so quickly, but really I think if you are in a similar situation and explain that to them, as long as you can get your records/reports etc. to them, they most onc's will get you in quickly.  Anyway, this fourth onc had the same two Tx recommendations, expressed a slight preference for my first onc's preferred choice, but said that either would be appropriate and that there were good reasons for going with the one I had sort of been planning on also.  Thank God I had done A LOT of research and understood the differences between the two (outcomes, stats, side effects, both short- and long-term, NCCN guidelines, etc.). I gave it a little thought and decided, in the end to go back to the first onc. and go with her recommendation.  It was a real marathon, and getting a second opinion doesn't usually lead to all that I went through, but I'm not sorry for any of it.  I feel like I had four highly skilled oncologists examine my case, each of them coming back with similar recommendations, and in the end I felt comfortable with the Tx I decided on.  It was not what I had initially hoped for, but I am at peace with it now.  It was difficult having all these doctors say, \"Well you could do A or B, either would be fine, pros and cons to both, so which one would you like to do?\" In some ways I felt educated enough to make a decision for myself, but in some ways, I just wanted it to be clear-cut and uncontentious. I will say that the doctor-patient relationship as well as my impressions of the doctors strengths and weaknesses did enter into my final decision.  The onc. I went with just scored a lot higher.  But I did not want that to be the highest priority in making my decision, because what I fundamentally need from my onc. is the best possible CA Tx, not warm and fuzzies.  The relationship is important and I'm relieved that I ended up with the doc who made me feel the best, but knowing that I was getting the best Tx was more important to me. So that's my two cents on the second opinion question. A word on affording medications.  ASK FOR SAMPLES if you don't think your insurance will cover them.  I ended up taking samples home for two meds and I didn't even ask for them.   Also make sure ahead of time that you have what you need for your ins. co. to pay for them -- when I went to fill the Emend script the first day, my pharmacist said my ins. had not agreed to pay for it because they wanted pre-approval from the doc's office.  I had never heard of this being necessary to get a medication before, but it was.  So make sure.  I wanted to express my sympathy to all of you ladies who are premenopausal and possibly still wanting to have children.  This has got to be especially worrisome and frightening for you.  I am only 39, but post-menopausal (I went through menopause when I was 33). I had not had children yet and was hoping too very soon when menopause hit.  So I have been through the horrible experience of infertility, just not because of cancer, and I can sympathize with the fears you must have.  I know that many if not most women who have chemo before menopause regain their fertility once Tx is finished, but I realize that you all must be scared anyway.  Just wanted to say that. ",

Hope you are having a good day.  I am sorry for those of you who are feeling so crummy right now.   I can't remember who asked about age (sorry), but I'm 39, though not by much.   I also can't remember who asked about the Neulasta shot (sorry again), but I thought I'd tell you about my experience with it, even though my doc said I had a severe reaction.  She keeps telling me that my weight being low has caused my side effects to be harsher and longer lasting.  Anyway, I went in for it on Day 2. But the end of the day I was having back pain.  Then, for about the next five days I had intense bone pain.  It happens in your long bones, like femurs, tibia, fibula, ribs.  I had it most in my ribs, all the way around from front to back, and in my shins. It hurt.  They had given me Tramadol and Darvocet for it, but neither was strong enough, and Darvocet makes me sick anyway (which I told the nurse to no avail), so I finally ended up taking Dilaudid (a much more powerful narcotic) that I had left from post-surgery.  Didn't quite make it go away, but it did help a lot.  After about Day 6 or 7 (don't remember), it stopped.  The hardest part was that at the same time, the taxotere was causing really intense muscle spasms, especially in my back, so for a handful of days I felt pretty incapacitated.  I generally have a very high pain threshold, but the combo bone and muscle pain was , well, really bad.  I was still able to get out some and do some light walking, though, so I wasn't bed-bound the whole time.  Keep in mind, though, that my onc said Neulasta shots are usually tolerated more easily than this.    I'm on Day 17, and have been feeling better, but last night and today, I've been running a fever and feeling like I'm coming down with something.  Glands sore, headache, pressure in my ears, kind of stuffy.  It's not enough to make me say that I'm sick exactly, more like I feel as if I'm getting sick.  Gonna take it easy today, skip occupational therapy, and monitor my fever.   I'd like your opinions on something else too, if you don't mind.  About a week and a half ago I noticed a palpable lump under my arm on the non-affected side.  I was scared when I found it.  More scared than I was when all this started.  But, rationally, I thought that with everything going on in my body -- healing from two surgeries, chemo, etc., and what my doc still thinks was the shingles after my first Tx -- it would be very typical to have swollen lymph nodes that don't mean cancer.  But it was still scary.  My husband paged my doc the next morning (I wasn't really able to talk because of the mouth sores), and she said that \"they\" don't usually worry about swollen lymph nodes.  But I kept thinking of those of you and others I've known who have felt things, been told they're nothing to worry about, and later found you/they had cancer all along.   Yesterday I saw my onc for a routine visit, and she could feel it, but still was not concerned.  I explained that I can't help but be concerned because of these experiences of other people that I know about.  She was very understanding of this, and said, \"Okay.  I understand how you feel, so what we'll do is get an ultrasound of it.  But we will need to wait until chemo is over.\" Being a dummy, I didn't think to ask why wait, but I am at least relieved that she's going to take it seriously.  So my questions are, would you wait? Have any of you had this issue come up? And I would be very appreciative of any other thoughts or advice you might have. Thanks all.  Good luck today for those who have Tx's and for everyone else just trying to get through the day.  Be brave and smile as much as you can!",

Calamtykel: I'm sorry to scare you about ITC pain killers, but let me just say again that different drug cocktails require different things.  Advil may be fine with the regimen you're on, even though it's not fine for the regimen I'm on.  My point was just to encourage everyone to make sure they've talked about it with their docs, so that everyone knows what kinds of OTC drugs are or are not safe.  Still... sorry. mlv: You were asking about the Decadron (brand name for dexamethasone).  It helps on several fronts, mostly nausea and inflammation that causes pain.  I have wondered about those of you who have said your onc's are choosing not to use it, because from my reading it is a first-line defense/prophylactic against the more severe nausea that can happen immediately following chemo and in the first few days afterwards.  I would be interested to know why these particular onc's are against using it.  It does have side effects (many possible ones in fact, as with any drug -- you might look at drugs.com or rxlist.com, both reputable sites if you want more info).  One is certainly a feeling of being wired (this is true with any steroid) and possible insomnia.  Others can include depression, weight gain, muscle weakness/discomfort, acne, headaches, and sweating.  Keep in mind that many of these (and other) se's happen when people are taking it consistently over time, not for a few days every few weeks.  Still it effects people in different ways.  I had no insomnia from it, nor any feeling of fatigue when I stopped it (the fatigue had already set in!).  Then again, I am only on half of what is usually prescribed because of other health problems.  So, maybe, what do I know?  I think the most important thing to keep in mind is that you should closely monitor any se's and let your onc know about them, because if you're having se's that are related to the Decadron, a dosage adjustment might need to be made. I was feeling better for a few days, but starting yesterday and throughout today (Day 17) I have not felt well.  Very fatigued, a little nauseous, with swollen glands in my neck, an earache, a mild fever... I don't fell exactly sick, more like I'm getting sick. It's disappointing because I was hoping for a nice week or so of feeling better before next Tx.  Now I'm worried about having a fever, and worried that if I do really get sick I won't be able to have my next Tx as scheduled.  Oh well, just gotta wait and see.  I'm still feeling much better than I was days 3-10, so I am entirely grateful for that, and not wanting to worry needlessly.  What happens will happen.  I will just take good care of myself, and assume the best! Good luck to those of you starting tomorrow, and for everyone else, one more day down!  May it be a good one!",

Anyway, being wired, and having nothing else to do, I went shopping.  A few small things for myself and a birthday present for my sister.  I love buying gifts for people, so having that to do helped me distract myself from the seemingly ever-present thoughts of Bixby, my dog.  Aside from that though, I have just been crying for three days straight.  I'm really worried about the combination or this deep loss,  the se's I expect to begin tomorrow, the Neulasta shot (had a miserable time with that last time), and my already less-than-stable bipolar disorder.  Also, when Bixby was so weak, I had to carry him around a lot (about 56 pounds), in and out of cars, up and down stairs.  I had no choice.  Dh never seemed to be home at the right times.  Anyway, in all of that lifting and carrying his weight around, I really pulled or strained a muscle in my upper back.  And I remember from my first round that the taxotere gave me VERY intense muscles spasms, on top of the bone pain from the Neulasta.  So I'm scared of how much pain I might be in for.  I'm going to call my onc tomorrow and ask about getting a scrip for a muscle relaxant like Flexeril or something.  The pain meds, or at least the ones they gave me last time, just didn't cut it, and now I have a back injury to boot!  Blah. Blah. Blah.  Sorry to be so negative.  I'm just really struggling.  I have been so obsessed and pre-occupied by Bixby's illness, and his death, that it didn't even really occur to me until this morning that it was an infusion day.  Not completely -- I took the meds I was supposed to take and all that, though I forgot completely about drinking lots of water until this morning. Hope that doesn't hurt anything. I feel sad, angry, frustrated, and overwhelmed by Bixby's death, that I don't know how well I am going to be able to take care of myself through this round.  And my psychiatric Tx team is extremely concerned. But my psychiatrist isn't willing to do anything different with my meds until chemo is over, with the exception of adding Ativan at my onc's request (and I already take 5 mg of Xanax every day! Anyway, I'm feeling pretty hopeless right now, and the se's haven't even begun.  Not hopeless like, \"I know this cancer is going to kill me\" or anything, just not very optimistic about  having the strength to fight the cancer to the best of my ability and at the same time avoiding a bipolar crash, which could end me in the hospital (a psych. hospital), while I'm trying to get through the rough parts of my Tx's.  They wouldn't know how to take care of a cancer patient actively in Tx there.  I know, I'm probably borrowing anxiety, but I am just so much more down now than I have been through this whole cancer process.  Since I was diagnosed, I have succeeded at having a very positive and optimistic attitude, but I feel like the rugs been pulled from under my feet (so much more so than I did even when I was diagnosed. Well, I will stop the pity party, and do this instead: Thank you all for just being here, for embracing the spirit of camaraderie .  I continue to be amazed and humbled by the caring, support, advice, gentle nudging, and just plain affection that we have developed.  Thank you Lizzy.",

My next Tx date is Sept. 14.  Don't know after that. SOMANYBLESSINGS: Welcome to our group.  I hope you find it as helpful and supportive as I have.  And it sounds like you could use all the support, care and concern as possible.  I am so sorry you have been so sick.  I hope that your next Tx is easier on you and your kids! Gingerbrew: I was scheduled for a routine mammogram and bone density scan on April 22. I pretty much knew that day that I had cancer. They took the usual pictures, and then called me back into the room for a \"diagnostic mammogram\" (that's just when they take a thousand more pictures).  They looked again, then took more pictures. The next day I flew to and from Oklahoma for an uncle's funeral. Four days later, April 27, my gynecologist (who orders my mamm's) called me in the evening to tell me the results of the mammogram and referring me to a breast care specialist/surgeon.  Her office had already made the appt. for me. That took place the following Monday, May 3rd. At that appt., my surgeon reviewed all my films, chest x-rays, which had been taken the previous week because I had a bad case of bronchitis, did an ultrasound, and an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. Two days later, May 5, she called, also in the evening, me with the results -- the official Dx. So not quite two weeks between first Mamm. and Dx. Then there was a lot of testing, as we're all familiar with, a few second opinion appointments, then finally on June 8, lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  (I could have had this done sooner, but I wanted time to get second opinion and do some research.) Got the pathology report from that three days later, June 11, at my surgeon's office. Report was worse than the biopsy report had been, and there was lymph node involvement and no clear margins. We could have tried another wide excision, but my breast size was so small (esp. relative to the cancer site) that I had to do Mx.  That was done on June 22.  After that there was a long wait until chemo began.  Surgical healing of course, but also a fair amount of disagreement/discussion among my physicians (including two second opinion onc's.). So Tx regimen was not decided for several weeks, and I finally began chemo on Aug. 2. Summary:   Mammogram/diagnostic mammogram - 4/22                    Notification of results - 4/27 (five days)                    Appt. w/ surgeon/ultrasound/needle biopsy - 5/3 (6 days)                    First Pathology report - 5/5 (2 days)                    First surgery - 6/8 (34 days)                    Second pathology report - 6/11 (3 days)                    Second surgery - 6/22  (14 days)                    First chemo - 8/2 (41 days) All totaled: 14 1/2 weeks between finding out about the CA and first chemo.  I feel that in the beginning, things happened at a quick pace. Didn't have to wait long between doc appts.; tests were scheduled very quickly; pathology reports came back speedily, etc. My first surgery could have been sooner, but I wanted to slow down and think things through, etc. Same could be said about chemo.  By the time my I had settled on which onc/facility to get my Tx, six weeks had passed, and I had been to four medical oncologists.  I didn't have to see all those onc's, but my case was \"unusual\" for a number of reasons, and I was getting conflicting recommendations, so it took ME a while to decide for myself.  I could have gone with the first or second onc and started sooner, but, like I said, there were some complicating factors regarding what kind of chemo regimen (my current health status, my history of cardiac complications, psychiatric Tx that had to be coordinated,  and differing interpretations of diagnostic indicators). That's probably way more than you wanted to know! sorry. ",

Day 8 of Tx #2.  Still dealing with se's, some are the same as last time, some are different, some better, some worse.   Have loved reading about folks (thanks Sweeney), and will contribute something about myself soon, just at a moment when I have a little more energy than I have presently.  For now... Sweeney: Yes on the headaches and memory loss! Headaches have been much worse with 2nd Tx, memory loss about the same, but definitely a thing. On that note, if anybody doubts that chemo brain is a real thing, try this experience... A normal day, you got up made the coffee, went through your morning routine of showering, dressing, taking care of the pets, reading the paper, checking your email -- whatever you do.  Not in any rush to get to anything. Nothing particularly stressful about the day.  Okay, maybe not feeling all that well because you're being treated for cancer, but otherwise, you're you, and you're going about your day not realizing that anything is different or out of whack. You've been up an hour or two.  Your morning coffee or juice kicks in and you have to pee.  Walk into the bathroom, unzip, unbutton, look down, and lo and behold, you're wearing not one, not two, but three pair of underwear!  Now, I've been through many inordinately stressful times in my life.  I've been distracted by a wide variety of circumstances.  I've dealt with many illnesses, including mental illnesses.  I've been on multiple medications in my adult life that have affected memory as well as cognitive functioning.  I had my adolescent/young adult experiences of experimentation and humor (as Lizzymack called them).  AND I've been through menopause.  So please, nobody try to persuade me that unknowingly outfitting myself with three pair of panties at the same time, and not even realizing that anything was off, is ANYTHING other than chemo brain! If you tell me it's NOT, that it's just me and my emotionally-stretched-too-thin current existence, you might just break my heart.   That's my story for today.  Hope it gives everyone a much-needed laugh.",

Zachsmom: You go girl! I am very impressed that you'll be running today.  My goal this year was to run in the Chicago marathon, but I wasn't far enough along in training by the time this cancer thing started, so I decided not to, but instead I decided to volunteer at the Breast Cancer Network of strength aid station.  I've never volunteered at a race before, but I decided it would be a good way for me to give something to both the breast cancer cause and to the race I love so much, and I thought it would help me to feel like I'm still connected to running even if I can't do much of it myself right now.  It's been nine years since I ran the Chi marathon, and was really excited about doing it this year, but now I know it will mean even more to me to run it next year after getting through all this.  I usually run with Team in Training (which raises money for the leakemia/lymphoma society, but next year I think I'll run with a breast cancer group and raise money for that instead. Anyway, you probably won't read this before the race, but I wish you the best run of your life anyway! lisasinglem: Wow! I didn't realize the show was starting so soon.  You've been a real trooper! As tired as I feel these days, I can only imagine what stamina it has taken for you to be at all those rehearsals, being on your feet all that time, and having to be \"on\" and, I imagine, having to prove to everyone that you are strong enough to do what needs to be done.  I'm proud of you! I bet you are probably somewhat on cloud nine after such a great show, but how are you holding up physically after all this? I do believe it's true that the more active your are, and the more you manage to live your life the way you usually would, the better you are in fighting the fatigue, but you have gone above and beyond!  I am rooting for you next weekend with your Tx followed by three weekend shows! You have all of our support and confidence behind you!  (But don't forget to come to us if it gets hard.) As for me, I'm just trying to keep my emotional head above water.  I'm not feeling bad about my cancer or Tx's.  I've had a rough time with se's, but I still have a very positive attitude about the whole thing in general and the Tx's in particular.  They're hard, but I've faced worse.  It's other stuff (combined with the drain and discomfort of cancer Tx I suppose) going on that is making things particularly difficult for me.  I find inspiration by thinking about all the millions of people in the world (and I think particularly of stories I've been told about my family and all my ancestors had to go through just to survive) who have had to deal with exponentially more difficult things.  For example, my husband's grandfather was in Germany during WWI, and his troops were very close to the Russian front line.  A battle broke out, and suddenly he found himself behind enemy lines with a bullet in his back after his troops had pulled back.  He hid out with no food or water and a bullet in a pile of concrete from a fallen building.  He hid there in a crevice for three days and nights before the Russian soldiers had pulled out, then set out walking by himself.  He ended up making his way on foot all the the way to Poland where a farm woman found him and nursed him back to health over a few months time.  Then I think of my grandmother whose husband suffered a stroke in the early fifties which paralyzed him almost completely from the neck down.  At that time, there were no good options for long-term care, especially since she had only a very small pension from the railroad where my grandfather worked. So she took care of him almost single-handedly in their home for seven years before he finally died. Can you imagine? So I think of people like them, and so many more, and I say to myself, \"If those people were strong enough to get through those things, then there's no reason why I can't be strong enough to get through this!\" Anyway, that's how I keep going, even now, when I'm not doing particularly well.

Thank you. And thank you to everyone who expressed sympathy and concern.  I'm using every kind of meditation and visualization I know of to stay in a positive frame of mind, because I know that when things start to go badly, it's very easy for our minds to sort of resign themselves to the fact that the se's will be bad, and I think that can result in actually having worse side effects than we might otherwise.  I don't want to create a reality in my mind that doesn't have to be.  Some people have mentioned having chest tightness early in the Tx cycle.  I absolutely think that if you have any question at all about it, you should contact your onc, but I will share my experience.  I have had terrible chest tightness each time, but we figured out that it was from the bone pain in my ribs from the Neulasta shot.  This is a very common place to have bone pain, because it is primarily in your long bones where bone marrow does its thing.  It can make breathing deeply VERY painful, and it seems like there's no comfortable position to lie in.  Just my two cents.

Boost and Ensure have high protein drinks, they are always helpful for when your throat's on fire, or when food doesn't taste right, or when you're too nauseous to eat real food.  And Gatorade, Gatorade, Gatorade for hydration -- it's got the electrolytes you need like salt and potassium.  There's even a low sugar kind called G2 if you're worried about that or empty calories.  Pedialyte is another good option, less sugar, and not as strong a flavor, if you prefer.  If you're vomiting or having diarrhea, you can't drink too much Gatorade.  You can, however, drink too much water, as others have discussed.  If you drink TOO much water, you end up with lower concentrations of sodium and potassium. Couldn't sleep last night.  Been up since three.  Took an Ativan to try and sleep some more, but it didn't help.  Having too many racing thoughts.  The good news is that I don't feel nauseous at the moment, though it often starts a little later in the day, and the bad news is, I think my mouth is getting all messed up again.  I have that pre-mouth sore, scalded feeling. :(  Please no more mouth sores!!! Please!!! Hope everyone wakes up to a bright and cheery morning.  For some reason I'm about to break out in song from the musical Oklahoma! so I'll sign off and spare y'all! Hugs {{{ }}}} ",

What you must be going through is beyond me.  I can't imagine how hurt and angry and betrayed and demoralized you must be feeling.  I hope, like Ginger said, that your onc gave them a piece of his mind.  Did he?  I'm really curious.  Have your friends, the ones who really did come to the BBQ to show their love and support for you, reaching out to you?  Do they realize what a shit storm this lunatic has dredged up? How is your mother-in-law reacting to this?  How is Daniel reacting to this? And how are your poor poor nerves holding up? Is there anything we can do? I would love to be able to get in on this Facebook \"conversation\" and say a few things myself!   My sister and brother-in-law are both cops in Ft.

Then help you hire a lawyer and sue the bitch for slander, among other things! Give me the word, and I'll be there throwin' a little shit around myself!  This is beyond cruel, and I can't stand the thought of it happening to someone as kind and wonderful as you, or really, anyone for that matter.   Is there anything we can do to help you through this? Because this is life or death stuff we're talking about, and your whole system, body and spirit need to be nurtured and strengthened now, not compromised because of anyone else's spite or jealousy or whatever is motivating her.  Definitely, what everybody has said about keeping your distance is right on, which you know already.  But, even though I would want to keep my head and my morality above all this garbage, I can also imagine wanting to expose to everyone who knows her, just how rotten a person she must be to do all this.  Sigh. Again, I am so so sorry, and I sincerely hope you are getting the support you need to remove yourself from all this unhealthy stress and focus on getting better.  Please let the people who love you take good care of you through this. And know that we are among them! Whitney ",

Adey: Welcome to chemoland! I'm wishing you few side effects and lost of humor.  I totally agree with Lizzy that there is a lot of humor to be found here.  Last night, I was sitting in the kitchen with dh, and did one of those big, arms over your head stretches, and my dh just started chuckling.  I looked down, with my arms still over my head, and saw my one little boob (and I do mean little!) on the right side and my boobless (that's what we call it, the \"boobless\") on the left, and we both just broke out laughing.  He said, \"Well, there's one little boob there!\"  I know, it sounds like nothing, but it was funny.  I didn't bother with reconstruction because I am so small-chested anyway.  I don't wear a prosthesis of any kind either, and, to be honest, with my sports bra on, you can barely tell a difference between one side and the other. But we've always joked about my \"little boobies\" anyway.  I might opt for reconstruction at some point, but I just don't really care that much now.  Then there's the pharmacy of prescription mouth rinses on my bathroom counter, each with their little measuring spoons.  I gave up trying to fit them all in my medicine cabinet long ago.  And then, of course, there's the baldness.  We've taken a bunch of pictures and sent them to friends and family, and I'll tell you what, I've never gotten this many compliments about any haircut I've ever had!  Everyone seems to like me bald.  My husband can't stop telling me how adorable he thinks I look.  He also says it's hot!  So maybe I'll just stay bald.  Besides, it's soooo much easier!  And it makes hot flashes pass much quicker when you can just rip off your hat or scarf and feel cool air on your head! (God, men have it so easy!) Hot flashes and nightsweats are less funny, I have to admit, especially when you're having a deep, meaningful conversation with someone, or in some professional setting, and all the sudden you're aware that your face is on fire, and you're sweating, and the person you're talking to is probably either thinking you're having a heart attack, or that you're really embarrassed about something.  Then thinking that, you do become embarrassed, and that just makes your face turn redder.  Also very little is funny when you're up three times a night ripping off your pajamas and sitting in the middle of the room under the ceiling fan to cool down enough to go back to sleep.  But things are funny.  As much as I hate having these problems, we even joke about the diarrhea and constipation!  I'm like you too Lizzy, always making conversation and joking with the people at the hospital.  I made my surgeon laugh when I told her that if I do ever do reconstruction, I will ot want a regular areola tattoo. I want a tattoo front and center of a yellow smily face with sunglasses giving a thumbs-up sign.  I mean it too! You gotta have a little fun with this. You might think this is a little gross, but my dh is due for a baseline colonoscopy, and we've decided the night before he goes in, we're going to magic marker a big bulls-eye to mark the spot.  We'll do it too! Anyway, enough about that.  Yesterday I had to go see my doc because the condition of the inside of my mouth just keeps getting worse.  Turns out, it's infected, so now I have another bottle of prescription, this time antibiotic, mouth rinse to add to my growing collection.  I have to swallow it too, because it's in my throat as well.  I HATE MOUTH SORES!! Before I started chemo, and was reading about possible side effects, I wasn't too alarmed, but the one thing I kept saying to everyone was, \"I really hope I don't get the mouth sores.\" And lo and behold, I've had them every time! Oh well, I least I've learned I can handle it. Joystars: I smiled reading your post, thinking about you holding your little baby! Texas: I hope you're still with us, and that you will stay with us.  I know this is \"just\" an online community, but it is a real community of friends -- good friends.  And our love and concern for you is real!  {{{{HUGS}}}} to everybody.  Let's laugh today! Through our nausea and constipation and acne and weight gain and mouth sores and stinky pits and heartburn and headaches, LET\"S LAUGH!!! ",

      "Content": "Sep 23, 2010 08:40AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:47AM by wherria Good morning Chemosabes! Jsw19: On the knitting, I love to knit afghans and give them away as gifts.  That's probably my favorite thing.  I also knit hats, and I love to knit and then felt  purses and bags, have even sold several.  (I'm pretty good at felting.) They also make great gifts.  Another thing I like to do is little Christmas tree ornaments (miniature sweaters, stockings, trees, etc.).  They're very cute.  My dh and I have six nieces and nephews, and each year we give a Christamas tree ornament to each of them, so that when they start they're lives as adults with their own trees, they'll have a stock of handpicked, unique, and often hand'-made ornaments to put on them.  They really love it.  My sisters girls in particular, maybe because they're a lot older than the rest, can't wait each year to get their ornaments and see what they are.  My sister says that when they decorate their tree, both girls (one is 19, the other 16) take out all their ornaments from the year they were born and lay them out in order, then open their new ones and start decorating.  She says the ornaments we've given them pretty much fill up the tree.  It's a really cool tradition, and quite heartening to know how special it has become to them.  Anyway, I do love to knit (and quilt).  It's a great thing to do with some Chopin in the background, or if you prefer, a book on tape (was it you who said you were trying those? can't remember).  Right now I'm working on a very complicated afghan for my Aunt Bugs -- yes, that's what we call her.  Her name is Clara Joyce, but when she was a child, her grandfather nicknamed her Bugs (who knows?) and it has stuck.  She lost her husband, my uncle, this year, and so she gets an afghan! Lizzy: You're absolutely right about the nurses (and docs sometimes) who have never heard of the remedies that we all read about, and not just on these sights but in seemingly reliable books and websites.  My first Tx, I asked the nurse about shewing on ice chips to help prevent mouth sores (personally, I'm not at all convinced that this works, but still, it is advised by so many people), and she looked at me like I was from Jupiter.  I also asked her about Claritin, and she still didn't seem to know what I was talking about.  Then when I left, I looked at the little booklet my onc's office gives on coping with side effects, and there was the suggestion to take Claritin! About the red sauce, I'm sure heartburn is part of it, but I was told by my onc's office that the caution was regarding mouth sores.  Because it is acidic, it can irritate your mouth, cause an irritated mouth to turn into a mouth full of sores, or make mouth sores worse.  I can tell you from my experience, since I have had such a problem with mouth sores, that they are right about avoiding the tomato sauce.  BUT if you're not having an issue with mouth irritation/sores, I doubt there would be any harm. So enjoy! And when this is over, and my mouth no longer feels like it's full of razor blades, I'm looking forward to a big helping of your homemade lasagna! Deal? Lisasinglem: Congratulations on your return to the stage! Sounds like it wasn't the easiest night of your life, but YOU DID IT!  Way to go, girl! Kimmie: I too have had a major problem with tooth sensitivity (or should that be teeth sensitivity?). I have to eat things at room temperature.  The mention of a cold drink makes me shudder! And having the mouth sores, anything hot is out of the question, so room temp it is.  I will say (and my onc concurs), that Sensodyne toothpaste helps.  It's not magic, but it helps, especially if you use it three or four times a day for at least a minute.  It can take a few days for it to start to make a difference, but it has at least for me.  My teeth aren't just sensitive when I eat cold things either.  It's all of the time, like when I breath in.  It isn't excruciating or anything like I've got an exposed nerve, but it's bad enough to get your attention, and keep you uncomfortable.  At first I was scared that I had cavities or something, which of course I wouldn't be able to do anything about until after chemo, but my onc told me it's not an uncommon se.  The constipation thing: Everyone is so different, and some side effects come and go, so I wouldn't say it's number one on my list of se's -- there are too many competing for number one :( -- but it's definitely near the top of the list.  My chemo regimen tends to cause more diarrhea, which I've also had, but I'm on non-cancer related meds that cause constipation, and then add the pain meds and anti-emetics which are hugely constipating, and I end up swinging back and forth between const. and dia., more on the const. side since I keep having to take the meds. Neither of which helps my poor little bottom!  Ouch is right! My onc gave me a protocol for dealing with the const.  It basically boils down to senna or senekot or senekot-s, beginning with two at night and two in the morning.  If that doesn't work go to three in the am and three pm.  If after two days, this produces no bowel movement, call doc.  If it does, then the idea is to wean off, like back to three at night, two in the am; two pm, two am, one pm, one am.  The problem is I never get to the point where I'm actually regular and can start weaning off, before I have to take more of the meds that cause the constipation, so I've practically been staying on three am and three pm.  My onc says this is okay and that (this was my worry) my system WILL NOT become dependent on them in the time I'll be needing to take them.  BTW, when I get to the point that three pm and three am still don't work (in addition to dietary/exercise stuff too of course) I don't call the doc, I take a slightly larger than recommended dose of milk of magnesia at night, and that works for me, without cramping.  There, that's my two cents on constipation.  I felt lucky that I didn't have to take any anti-emetics at all yesterday.  A nausea-free day! Yay! Today, so far so good.  But, darn it if my mouth doesn't hurt!  Fortunately coffee still tastes like coffee to me, so I can enjoy my morning two cups. Now I'm using high protein vanilla boost in my coffee.  Not bad. And it cools the coffee down enough for me to drink it. For those coffee drinkers, you might want to try it.  I don't like drinking Boost/Ensure, but I need to, so this is a way I can get one in. Good day to all! ",

They lay out in a pretty easy to understand way, in a flow-chart kind of format, their recommendations for appropriate treatments (including the preferred chemotherapy regimens) for all types of breast cancer.  Most oncologist follow these Practice Guidelines pretty closely.  In my case, my oncologist's practice requires that they follow NCCN guidelines and not provide treatments that are outside those Guidelines, but other oncs will provide some treatment variations that follow the intent if not the letter of the Guidelines.  You can find them through two websites that I know of: nccn.org and asco.org.  Good luck! LadyinBama: I just wanted you to know that I am on Taxotere, and have been experiencing a fair amount of peripheral neuropathy, so it's not just Taxol. In fact, mine has been getting progressively worse with each treatment.  Now, it may be the case that with Taxol the chances of it becoming a permanent condition are greater.  I don't know. Lisaattheshore: Diuretics was the word you were looking for, and you're right that when shortness of breath becomes an issues an onc might then consider prescribing a diuretic, because it could indicate that there is water collecting around the lungs (pleural effusion, or pulmonary effusion).  Worst case scenario is that pleural effusion can lead (over time) to congestive heart failure, so it is important to get it checked out, though the worst case may be unlikely to happen.  One issue with taking diuretics during chemo is that if you're having trouble getting food/water, or are having vomiting/diarrhea you can become dehydrated more easily.  All questions to ask the doc! To all my dear friends: Have a wonderful day; enjoy these first days of autumn/last days of summer,; get some sunshine on your faces, and if you're not feeling well, hypnotize yourself into believing that you do!  {{{HUGS}}} Whitney ",

My dh left yesterday for Indianapolis for 3 1/2 weeks.  I'm going to have to be very vigilant  about keeping my emotional head above water.  I have some friends around here, but most of our friends don't live that close by, and so since I don't work, I am going to have to stay as active as I can to keep from getting too depressed and lonely.  Of course, this fourth chemo has completely knocked my on my butt, and I can't do very much for any length of time without getting extremely short of breath and dizzy and weak.  Yesterday I invited a friend to go shopping with me to celebrate the news that I'm done with chemo (decided not to go for the six TC treatments and stay with four), and we went to one store, bought a few pieces of clothing, and then I asked her if we could just go sit in our booth at our favorite diner and have coffee, because I was starting to feel dangerously weak.  That's all I could do.  Of course sitting in a diner and talking is just as good as walking around a mall, so no complaints. My 71-yr-old mom had to have a stress test two about two and a half weeks ago, and still has not gotten to talk to her pain-in-the-ass cardiologist about the results.  Last week she called her PCP and his PA got the results sent to their office.  The results said that my mom has had an \"old\" heart attack (we have no clue about this), and \"the doctor will speak with her about it at her appointment on Oct. 25th.\"  How ridiculous is that??!!!  She's tried calling, paging, and begging to get in sooner or to talk to him on the phone, but nobody will budge.  She's beside herself, frustrated and scared.  My dad and I are champing at the bit for her to allow us to call and raise a stink, but she's been so anxious about the whole thing, she told me last night that it will just be better for her nerves if she just tries not to think about it and waits until her appointment.  I respect that.  All the phone calls and waiting for return phone calls can be very depressing and anxiety-producing, but it's driving me crazy.  She probably needs to be on a new medication or something, and this cardiologist is just letting her hang there.  Mind you, this is a woman who has already had two strokes, but has never had heart problems (other than high blood pressure), so this is all a shock and very scary.  She is not in good overall health, and because of a chronic pain problem can't really do much physically.  She also has severe depression, but she is doing the best she can.  I told my dad I wish I could go down to Texas myself and just walk into that cardiologist's office and not leave until I had her an appointment this week.  I've tried to find a way for her to get a referral to another cardio, and she talked to the PA at her PCP's about it, but she said it would take just as long or longer than she already has to wait.  It seems so ridiculous.  I've always been able to get squeezed in with specialists when I've needed them in similar situations.  I'm wondering if it has to do with her age as the elderly are not always given the attention they need or maybe their insurance.  I don't know.  I guess I'll stop ranting, but I'm just overloaded emotionally, and I'm having trouble dealing with this news about my mom.  I worry a lot about my parents. Neither is in good health, and they don't have much money or the best insurance, and they don't get treated by the medical system very well, and I feel so powerless to help.  I do help in whatever way I can.  I make phone calls for them.  I research doctors online.  Sometimes I talk to their doctors for them, because they are not very medically savvy.  And I help pay for things when I can.  But I guess there isn't anything more I can do about this one except help comfort and support my mom emotionally.  She just doesn't deserve this.  Even the PA at her PCP's was outraged, and said this cardio has opened himself to a huge liability.  I almost want to call him and play that card and see what happens.  Anyway, I'm still in SE land.  The cold is better mostly, still coughing and SOB easily, but my sore throat has gone away.  My last complaint, and then I'll shut up: I HATE THIS WATER RETENTION!!!!! Love and hugs to all my dear friends here. I truly hope everyone starts feeling better after all these colds and things.  And Lizzy, you are right.  We have a wonderful group here (and I say this despite my last few minutes of complaining), of strong, positive and forward-looking women.  How did we get so lucky as to find one another? I am grateful to each and every one of you, and I'm sorry to sound like such a bummer today.  I'm just scared, I guess. ",

That did more to help them heal (the Miracle Mouthwash doesn't actually help clear them up: it's a mixture of benadryl, lidocaine, and maalox of all things -- you do not swallow it).  But the Gel Clear also didn't help much with the pain, so I went on using it.  Then she prescribed an antibiotic wash, the name of which I can't remember -- something \"statin\" -- because they were getting infected.  That helped my tongue feel better, but I continued using anbesol, and she said that was okay. The important thing is that you have your once look at your mouth, especially if you have any fever, because they can get infected.  Good luck with them, and I'm sorry your having this problem.  It can be really painful.  Also, don't eat anything hot or anything too cold.  Stay with soft, cloe to room temperature foods.   My latest problem is my fingernails. The thumbs and first two fingers on both hands really feel like they've been crushed I was out for coffee yesterday with dg and a friend, and I couldn't even open a sugar packet they hurt so bad.  They're really dark in the nail bed with white splotches which indicates infection.  And the cuticles around them are all red and swollen.  My onc put me on yet another antibiotic.  Who would have thought I would need antibiotics for my fingers??

I'm supposed to go see my compression garment fitter today because after receiving a new sleeve and glove from her on Tues. everything swelled up worse than before.  I am REALLY scared about this Lymphedema thing.  It just keeps getting worse instead of better.  I know the chemo is making it worse (onc told me), so maybe it will get a little better after it's all done, but in the meantime, if it keeps getting worse I will graduate to a higher stage, and once you do, it doesn't go back down again.  It hurts and is so swollen.  I terrified I'm gonna live like this forever.  There is no cure.  Also my best friend is in the hospital, and I really wanted to go visit her today before my counts start dropping (she is in a very dangerous situation with severe neutropenia, is in isolation, and neither of us should be around the other once my counts drop), but I don't know if I'm going to make it.  It's really sad, because she's been stuck in isolation for almost two weeks now, very lonely and depressed.  I'd love to be able to go keep her company, but I just feel too crappy right now, and besides, I'm having diarrhea and don't even know if I could make the drive up there.  Sigh. Is anyone else battling Lymphedema? It really sucks. That's all I guess. Thanks for letting me vent.  I sure am catching on to what they mean when they say it is cumulative.  Don't mean to scare anyone.  I've had, according to my onc, worse than usual SE's all the way through, so don't assume it will be like this for everybody.  I've always reacted this way to medications -- getting the unusual SE's and reactions.  My psychiatrist teases me about always being the exception to the medical rule.  Quite a dubious honor! The stupid thing I did this morning is I took all my psych meds, half of which have a stimulant effect, so I won't be able to sleep this off!  Dumb.  I hope y'all have relatively SE-free day today.  Sweeney, I hope your little stray is okay this morning.   Good luck today and hugs to you all.  Thanks for letting me vent!

About Dilaudid, it's always been the best for me because it's stronger than oxycodone or hydrocodone, and for me at least, carries fewer side effects.  Less constipation than codeine derivatives and I hardly ever have nausea with it, which I always get with codeine drugs.  But docs do seem to be less likely to prescribe it, probably because it's stronger.  I have been able to get it though by telling my docs that anything with codeine makes me sick. And you don't have to take it as often. Back to the question of house cleaning.  I am so wiped out, sick and weak right now, I just don't have the energy to clean, but my friend is coming to visit soon, and my dh won't be home to help.  The problem, as I said before is that there is just so much clutter.  Do you think a cleaning service could help? Anybody used cleaning services before? How clean does it have to be before they come? I talked to my dad yesterday about the World Series game, and he was just so delighted!  He started to get really choked up talking about his Papa, and said, \"You know who I'll be thinking of tomorrow night!\" I got him telling stories, and it turns out my dad, pitched a winning game while he was playing American Legion ball against one of the Cardinal's farm teams!  (Farm teams were different back then, circa 1956. Not as organized, and not considered professional, but still!).  Also found out that my uncle on my Mom's side pitched against Mickey Mantle.  My mom's family lived in Miami (pronounced Miama), Oklahoma, and Mantle was from a town about 20 miles away.  Isn't that cool!!  Lizzy, I'm thinking of you in particular! Anyway, everyone is so excited.  I try not to think about how much I wish I could be there.  My dad is 77, and not in very good health, and this could well be his last opportunity like this.  Although, I told him, if the Cubbies make it to the series next year, then he should count on being there too! Sigh, my poor Cubbies. Any White Sox fans out there?  If so, remind me to tell you about my husband's commercial he did a few weeks ago with Ozzie Guillen! Okay, enough baseball talk.  Hope y'all have a good day!  ",

And as someone who has struggled with an eating disorder my whole life and body image, it is even more devastating.   Ann97: First of all ask all of your docs, not just your PCP.  I think breast surgeons probably have the widest knowledge about LE and who to go to for help, but I would ask all of your docs and see what you come up with.  It is very important to go to a very highly qualified OT or PT.  I've been to three and I can tell you they are not all the same.  The other two things I would do are check out the lymphedema.net site (I believe they have a search engine for finding therapists in your area, and their recommendation would be trustworthy), and I would also go to the websites of hospitals you like in your area, look for their rehabilitation services section and read about the services they offer and the staff members.  You will probably find a few who specialize in lymphedema.  Then based on all that, start making calls.  Now one of your docs may say, \"I know a therapist who specializes in LE and is really great.\"  If so, good, start there and see what you think.  In the meantime, read up about it to make sure you're getting what you think you need from whatever therapist you see.   As I said, I've seen three.  I didn't intend to do that or \"try out\" different therapists, but the first one I saw, who was excellent and who I was referred to by my breast surgeon had to have surgery on her elbow after I'd been seeing her for about three weeks.  So she referred me to her colleague in the same office, who was not nearly as good.  After seeing her for almost three weeks, I got a call saying she had fallen down some stairs and broken her wrist, and they would refer me to someone at a different hospital.  That person was okay, but discharged me too soon saying she had given me the tools I needed to self-manage.  So I thought, \"Great,\" and went about on my own doing the exercises and massage and wearing the compression garments she recommended, but my swelling has continued to get worse anyway.  So yesterday I called the first place again and asked if the OT I saw first was back yet, and lo and behold she had started back the day before! So I have an appointment to see her on Monday.  I am really excited, because I think she can help me, and she was so much better than the other two, much more knowledgeable and more talented. So that's why I've seen three different therapists.  A kind of sad chain of events.  I started to feel like I was dangerous to therapists!  Like a curse or something! You won't have to go through all that.  Chances are, your surgeon (that's the doc I would start with) can give you a good recommendation and will give you an order for the therapy. Hope that's helpful. ",

I have read several pages of the most recent posts, and it seems that everyone is pretty much movin' along. So Glad!  I miss everyone here, and wonder how all of you are, and thin about this group often.  I don't understand it, but soething has blocked me from being more present.  Not just fear, I think, but maybe just cancer fatigue. I don't know, but please don't take it as a sign that I don't care anymore, or don't love you all still. Question: What do you all consider your \"cancer anniversary\" date - diagnosis, beginning of Tx, end of Tx? As for me, I am almost always dealing with one health (ill-health) or another. Not all of it related to BC; there are several other life-long conditions too.  Its ok though. I am used to it, and I don't get scared easily because of it. BC-wise, I have not been very responsible about maintaining a relationship with an oncologist.  By the end of my chemo, and well into hormone TX, I had become pretty fed up with my oncologist stopped seeing him.  Earlier this year, I began the process of lining up a new oncologist at Loyola, but got distracted by a suspicious-looking thyroid mass, that is still undiagnosed. (I've had four biopsies, all without anything conclusive in either direction.) My thryroid doc says it would be appropriate to continue watching it, and it would also be appropriate to do a thyroidectomy. I've been hospitalized three times for very severe and scary cellulitis in my lymphedema arm, several bronchitis/pneumonia spells (which has to do with a primary immunodeficiency, not bc, stress fractures from aromatase inhibitors, which I decided about 6 months ago were impacting my life and level of functioning, so much that I stopped taking them. I will never know, of course, whether that decision will have made a difference in whatever may come, but I'm not looking back.  I tried all of them, and felt like I had less of a life on them than I had during chemo. Anyway, I recently discovered an axillary lump on the side opposite my original tumor, so again I am working on getting in with my new onco. I will keep you posted.  As I'm sure all of you have also had to deal with multiple scares and probably have adapted well enough to be less frightened by them than they once were, I would say they have almost become commonplace for me.  BUT, for some reason, I'm scared this time. So, hello to all my dear friends. I hope you are all doing well. I will love to hear more about what's up with y'all. And finally, thank you to those who have been faithful to this group and kept it going!",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2016 05:25AM wherria wrote: Oh my dear chemosabes, hello to you all! First of all, I DEEPLY apologize for not posting any follow-up after my last post. Thank you all for keeping me in your thoughts and maintaining my presence here in this group, even when I wasn't. You mean so much to me, I am ashamed that I left you all hanging like that. Second of all, today is the sixth anniversary of my original diagnosis. How do you all mark your anniversary -- by diagnosis date or last treatment date? It's kind of funny. I don't have many things on my calendar these days, as I am not working, and just don't have a lot of \"engagements\". So it is not unusual for me to not know what the date is. And I haven't thought much about this anniversary, but this morning, when I woke up, after taking the dogs out, breakfast, etc., as I was thinking about what I needed/wanted to do next, I thought, \"I want to check in on my support group. So I read up on a good chunk of past entries, and when I was thinking about what to write about myself, I looked at the date on my computer and discovered that it was my anniversary! I hadn't known the date! So, my last few posts were about a scare after a mammogram. There were \"architectural abnormalities\" in my remaining breast. My surgical onc said she wasn't too concerned and didn't see a reason for a biopsy. I didn't know what to think, but I sure wasn't comfortable with leaving it at that. So I talked to my PCP again. He's the kind of doctor who's not really very authoritative or directive, and kind of lets the patient take the lead. I am well enough educated medically that it usually doesn't bother me. In fact I think that may be why he is like that with me, because my best friend sees him too and says he's not like that with her. Anyway, he agreed with my inclination to go ahead with a biopsy, but suggested we scan it first. He ordered a CT (or maybe it was an MRI. I don't remember.) To be honest, I don't remember exactly what the CT showed, but whatever it was, it wasn't conclusive, and not very helpful diagnostically. So I went to see my medical onc, whom I hadn't seen for a very long time, and to tell you the truth I don't like very much. She did an ultrasound, and said she saw what the radiologist who interpreted the mammogram had seen, but she didn't think it was suspicious enough to biopsy. At this point, I started to doubt myself, thinking my PCP's opinion didn't mean that much because he usually just agrees with my thinking on things, and that the experts were telling me I didn't need a biopsy. So I stopped pursuing it. Then a week or so later, I thought, you know maybe I should talk to my surgeon about doing a prophylactic mastectomy. I made an appointment, but I was feeling kind of embarrassed, like I must be over-reacting. Anyway, I went, and she said that she understood my concern, and that she would agree to do the surgery, but still said she didn't think there was anything to worry about. First, though, she said let's do an MRI. (All of these appointments and scans took place over a span of about three weeks.) I did the MRI, and afterwards, the technician told me to wait because the radiologist wanted to talk to me. After ten or twenty minutes, the radiologist came and got me. He said he had asked a few other radiologists to take a look at the MRI, and they all agreed that this didn't look serious. He was very understanding and kind, saying he sympathized with how difficult it is to live with cancer and how complicated the choices regarding treatment can be. He said, the highest priority was for me to know that I, my situation, had been given the attention it deserved, and that I not walk away feeling that no one was taking me seriously. Still... he said something like, \"You have the opinions of three radiologists, and your oncologists, who all agree that a biopsy is not necessary, much less a mastectomy, but this is your body, and you are the one who has to live with whatever decision you make.\" Frankly, I was impressed. He didn't have to do that. But, I still didn't feel like this was nothing, so I told my surgeon that even if it was just prophylactic, I wanted to go through with the mastectomy. She said fine, and we scheduled it. Post-surgery... they found cancer. Very small, but there. Everyone agreed that all indications were that they had gotten it all, and that I didn't need more treatment. So that's where it ended. I have been fine since then, though surgical recovery was really hard this time. Sorry for the long story, but it seemed important to tell it in detail, because it's a good example of the complexity of living with BC and of valuing our own opinions, our own expertise and our own knowledge of our bodies and what we need for our overall wellbeing. Life is ok now. I am grateful for so many things. And I didn't think I would make it this far. But my life is still not what I want it to be, anc a good part of that has to do with the ways in which cancer, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy changed my life. Yes, Lizzie, there is a silver lining, several in fact, and there are ways in which this experience has changed me, but six years post diagnosis, I am definitely not \"over it\". There have also been some other medical conditions that have made life hard, maybe even harder than cancer. I might talk more about this in future posts, but for now I want to focus on how wonderful this group is and how much it has helped us all! I thank God for you all. Lizzie, you have been and continue to be one of the silver linings you asked about! Thank you so much for keeping us together. I can't even express how much that means to me, and I know to the others as well. Love and blessings to you all. I plan to stay in better touch from now on.",

ANd one last thing, I think you've told us this before, but is there a website where I can view your dolls? ckptry: Sorry you have so much stress going on right now, but good luck with your son's school and with your exercising.  I have to admit I'm a little jealous of all you girls who can exercise.  WIth my Lymphedema, I've been strictly told not to do any aerobic exercise at all -- for now, at least.   DebJ: Even though it is most likely a chemo thing, and most likely will go away, this blood sugar thing concerns me.  Having a diabetic husband, you obviously know the potential dangers of hyperglycemia.  As far as going to the doc, if it were I, I would monitor it myself for a little while, but when I say monitor it, I mean VERY regularly throughout each day.  You know, I'm sure that the most accurate read is when you wake up in the morning.  But I would monitor it at other times as well, and I would record each reading in a notebook along with time of day, and when and what you'd eaten. That way, if it does continue to run high, or if it starts to get way too high, you will have a record to show your doc.  Also about the doc question, I wouldn't go to this primary care doc that you hardly ever see.  An internal medicine person would be good, but for me, it would depend on the readings I was getting.  If I felt like my glucose was running way to high, or spiking at inappropriate times, I would go straight to an endocrinologist.  I just think that an endo would have more to offer in terms of managing your glucose while you're on chemotherapy than an internist would. I know mine does. Zenith: Yes my eyes are teary most of the time.  It's a known side effect of chemo, and having no or few eyelashes makes it worse, particularly when you're outside.  And then I too have dry gritty eyes at other times, usually toward the end of the day.  I also use Blink.  No prescription necessary.  It's OTC with all the other eye drops. Sweeney: Congratulations on selling your little critters? I've almost got the same thing going on.  There's a woman near me who runs a shop for cancer patients with things like hats, scarves, skin-care products, and cancer-related clothing and jewelry.  Since chemo started I have knitted a ton of hats, and she told me last time I saw her to bring her some, and she would sell them.  Just haven't gotten around to doing it yet.  But I'm a pretty good knitter, and I think if I want to, I could go on making hats and having her sell them for as long as I want.  Cool deal! Happy weekend everybody! ",

      "Content": "Nov 21, 2010 08:08AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 06:14AM by wherria Hi Chemosabes.  Boy, don't get me started on healthcare!  But Lizzy, you have gotten me started on the TSA scans!  There is another way, the old way, the more precise way, the cheaper way, the safer way -- dogs!  It has been shown that they can smell out bombs, liquids, powers, drugs, better than these X-ray machines can, and they only sniff crotches, they don't pat them down!!  It is unthinkable to me, that because the corporate Midases want to privatize the security industry (that's what's behind this, btw), that they will put people through known, and and not insignificant health risks, just to increase their income which is already so large that they won't even notice a difference! I keep thinking of all the people whose work depends on daily/weekly/ whatever travel, going through that much radiation, when some well-trained dogs could keep them safe just as well. Okay, enough.  I'm on day 4 of last Tx, and though I haven't been feeling great, it hasn't been as bad as I was afraid it would be... until this morning.  Yesterday, I was kind of manic, and managed to get a lot of things done at home -- for God's sake not cleaning!, but organizing bills, mail, computerizing ALL of our bill payments, cleaning out old files, stuff like that.  You see, my dh has hadnled the bills and related stuff for several years, since I became unable to work, and bless him, he's gotten it done.  But since he's been out of town so much these past few months, I've had to take it over, and have become horrified by how disorganized everything was.  So I bought the latest version of Quicken, proceeded to clean out files, sort out things that needed to be dealt with but weren't, and streamline our system.  Already, our home office has about half the paperwork in it than before (a big recycling week next week!), because he was holding on to every darn piece of mail that ever came here.  Anyway, I feel pretty proud of myself that I've been able to do this at all.  Just six or eight months ago, when Brian was away he asked me to take care of the bills while he was gone, and I messed them all up - forgot to put stamps on them, sent a few carbons along with the checks, forgot to put account numbers on checks, things like that.  My mental status just wasn't clear enough, and not b/c of bc, just Bipolar stuff. So I never thought I could do this well this time around, but look at me go!  I'm turning our whole operation into one tight little ship.  And now that I'm getting things so organized, I think I might not be so emotionally overwhelmed by what it takes to do it all, and I've told Brian that I'm going to take over all the bill paying and banking, insurance etc, for him again.  He's thrilled.  And I'm kind of encouraged. But back to the subject.  I started on all this a few days ago, but yesterday, aside from an hour-long trip to a yarn store, I worked all day of this stuff.  And I think I wasn't feeling well, but was so manic that I didn't really notice, until I stopped, and then realized I could just barely carry myself up the stairs because my muscles were so weak and burning so much, and that I had been coughing all day and evening, and that my mouth and throat sores were coming back...  Oh, and I had completely forgotten to do any of my Lymphedema exercises or bandaging, so my arm, hand, back, boobless and side were all completely swollen.  Blah.  Now this morning I feel really sick again.  But my brain is still very manic, so I plan to continue my work today.   I'm sorry I haven't been posting much.  I just got caught up this morning, and everyone seems to have a lot going on.  Positives and negatives.  I want to congratulate those who need it and say I'm so sorry to those who need that, but I've missed so much.  I feel like a deadbeat poster! I'm sorry.  But I hope you all know, that I am thinking about all of you and celebrating with you and sympathizing with you, even if I haven't mentioned it lately.  My moods, as you might be able to tell, haven't been that stable lately, and I just haven't been myself. But I'll echo what someone already said so nicely: \"I am eternally grateful for BCO and for each and every one of you! HUGS! ",

(and Calamty, no I haven't had rads).  I know it takes a long time for us to get over the chemo and for our bodies to feel better, but I guess the thing that concerns me most is that I feel worse.  I told my husband last night, that aside from the nausea, I felt the worst I've felt since chemo started.  The muscle pain and weakness and the neuropathy are all worse than they ever were even in the middle of chemo.  I know the effects are cumulative, and it would be no surprise if the last chemo hit me the hardest, but the muscle stuff didn't get this bad until about a week ago which would have been exactly three weeks since my last tx.  Doesn't that sound strange to y'all?   I see my onc tomorrow, so I'll see what he has to say. Cal, I hope you can get your port out, and I'm sorry it's bothering you so much.  The drainage doesn't surprise me though, because my uneducated guess is that it's probably just draining the fluid that your immune system is sending to the area as it would even without the tube there.  And it's probably also lymph that your system is sending in response to a foreign body, and since that foreign body happens to be an open tube, the fluid just drains out.  I don't know if that even made sense. momof2, how long ago were you in Winfield??  Hope everyone has a good day. ",

Headaches - gone. spasms - gone.  Hair - still gone.  Shortness of breath - mostly gone. Neuropathy - worse.  Lymphedema - worse and continuing to get worse :(. Muscle pain - worse. fatigue - worse.  Dry skin/eyes - same.  The neuropathy and lymphedema worry me the most. My occupational therapist no longer says she is optimistic about the swelling going down.  Instead she just says, \"We;re doing everything we can, and we'll just have to wait and see.\" I know am wearing layers of bandages over layers of cotton and layers of foam.  So I look like half of a linebacker (with pads on!). I have about three shirts that will fit over this monstrosity, and my arm is all but useless to me now.  And the neuropathy has gotten worse in my hands, and quite a bit worse in my feet, and now I'm feeling it up my lower legs some of the times.  The other thing that is far worse than when I was in the middle of chemo is the pain and fatigue I feel in my muscles - leg muscles mostly.  Just a short walk to the mailbox makes me need to sit down. And stretching exercises are excruciating.  I had hoped I would feel better by now, and I certainly didn't anticipate that some things would feel worse, but I am still hanging in there! On a more cheerful side, we were visited by my sister and brother-in-law for five days and had a marvelous time.  We laughed A LOT and talked about everything under the sun.  We targeted difference Chicago-style restaurants which they loved, did touristy kinds of things which they also loved.  (I paced myself.) But most of all we just enjoyed being together. I will read up on what's been going on for all of you, but in the meantime, I hope you are doing well, those finishing chemo, those who've gone on to rads and anyone in between. It's good to be back, my dear friends! ",

After my last chemo (3 1/2 weeks ago) I had the usual low energy level, shortness of breath, etc.  But it starting getting worse instead of better. Now I am at an all-time low.  I seem to need a lot of naps, though while I was in the middle of chemo I was never able to fall asleep for naps.  And now I feel even more tired than I did while chemo was still going on, and that's saying a lot! Also my muscles ache and burn much more than they did during chemo.  Like in the last week and a half, it's gotten to the point where I can barely climb my stairs at all, and even just getting up out of bed makes my legs burn and get very week.  Many times, I have almost fallen down from my legs just giving out under me.  The same is true in my arms, it's just less noticeable because I don't do as much with them.  Have any of you who have finished chemo noticed your fatigue and/or muscle pain and weakness getting worse?  I read somewhere that post-chemo fatigue can be worse than what you experience during chemo.  Has anyone heard of or experienced this? I'd appreciate any responses.  I see my onc on Wed. and will of course ask about it.  But it's really frustrating.  I was expecting to feel better, but in some ways I feel sicker than I did, or at least much weaker than I did during chemo.

I have a few excuses -- some combination of being very busy, having a steady stream of house guests since early December, and, not to be too obscure, some other \"stuff\" to deal with.  But things have settled down a lot now and I'm ready to be back in the fold!  I still have a lot of catching up to do to know what's been going on with each of you, but I'll at least give you a little update on what's been going on for me, cancer-wise.  I guess I can't complain.  Finished chemo in late Nov. and only recently beginning to feel like the side effects are really wearing off.  Except the fatigue; I think that's gonna take a long time.  As I said, I haven't read all the posts I missed, but have y'all experienced more muscle pain after chemo than you did during?  That's how it's been for me.  It started with my last treatment, but it actually seemed to get worse for weeks and weeks after that.  There were times when I could barely walk. Anyway, just in the past week have I started to notice the muscle pain getting better.  I've had chronic bronchitis since a few days before my last Tx, and you know how bronchitis can be -- it lingers, goes away, comes back... It's definitely better, but it's still hanging on a bit, but it's really not a big deal.  It's great to be able to taste food again.  It's great not to be nauseous anymore.  I don't walk around with tears running down my face nearly as much.  I still have weepy eyes once in a while but not like before! The mouth sores were memorable, that's for sure, but we have a way of forgetting pain, and I'm happy to say that the horribleness of it is fading into the past. My hair is starting to come back in, though it's still pretty patchy.  I'd say it's about 1/8th of an inch long, at least at it's longest. It's very soft and fluffy, and, strangely, darker on one side of my head than the other!?  I have exactly three baby eyebrow hairs! And my eyelashes are coming in a little too, but the weird thing is that the new eyelashes are blonde, and I mean yellow blonde!   My main battle, that just keeps getting worse is with the lymphedema.  I'm still seeing an occupational therapist at least three times a week -- that's since Sept.; we've tried several types of compression, taping and bandaging; and now I am waiting for my spankin' new, in-home, $6,000 pneumatic pump to help keep the swelling down, and maybe, hopefully, don't-want-to-expect-too-much-or-too-little, actually improve my situation.  It's a very new kind of pump, made specifically for LE.  Theoretically it's supposed to do more than just temporarily push fluid out of the affected areas, only for them to fill back up again.  It's supposed to mimic what the therapist does, Lymphatic Drainage Massage.  A rep from the company that makes these things came to one of my OT sessions and hooked me up to the pump (there are these wide straps connected to the machine by four big hoses that go around my left leg, around my waist, my chest, up over my left shoulder, and down to my fingertips) and gave me the hour-long treatment.  It doesn't hurt; it's kind of relaxing. My arm volume did go down a little by the time the hour was up, but by the next day it was just as swollen as before.  BUT I was clothed when she did it.  She said it didn't matter, but my OT said she thinks it will work much better when I use it on bare skin.  I hope she's right. My dh and I are on the verge of getting a new puppy!  We're working with the same breeder who sold us our dog, Marlow.  In fact, the mom of the litter we're waiting on is actually Marlow's sister! But there are show people who are interested in these puppies, and they get first priority.  So what we're waiting on is for the pups to reach about 8 weeks old, at which time they'll be evaluated for show quality.  If one of the pups does not go to a show home, then we'll get him/her.  In the meantime, the breeder keeps sending me pictures of the puppies as they're getting older, and I fall in love with them more and more each time.  I'm gonna be so upset if we don't get one.  I know of a few other breeders somewhat close to us who are expecting litters soon, but we're tired of waiting. Anyway, that's a not-so-brief update on me.  I love you guys and have missed you, and can't wait to read more about how you all have been and are. Thanks for being patient with me. Whitney ",

Michelle: I'm very happy to hear that your first Tx has gone ok basically and that you're beginning to  feel better than you were before day 6.   calamtykel: The way two of my doctors have talked to me about their concerns with my case is that the Oncotype test is very reliable, reliable enough to heavily influence Tx decisions.  However, it looks at the cancer in one way, while the pathology/cytology findings look at it in a different way.  My cancer was actually over one cm, but the system lists it as 1.  Not a huge difference, I realize.   And though my stage is still a IIa, there are some ominous findings on the path. reports (I've had 3) that would indicate a poorer recurrence risk.  I don't mean to bore anyone with details, but since you asked... There was only one affected node, but it was relatively far away from the tumor site, and the tumor inside the lymph node was on the large side, so a macroinvasion not microinvasion.  My surgical oncologist was surprised by both of these things, saying \"It often means the CA is sneakier than it would first appear when a small early CA like yours has somehow move this far away and to this extent.\"  Docs are also concerned about some other things on path. report: extent of vascular invasion; extensive intraductal component (BTW, all the grades of the DCIS which was spread throughout the breast were 3's.); in terms of the invasive part of the cancer, it was poorly differentiated, with nuclear pleomorphism  score of 3 -- in short each of my docs explained that if my mitotic count had been just one point higher, the overall grade of my tumor would be a 3, not a 2.  They were also surprised at how much the comedo necrosis they found, again saying surprising for this size tumor.  So docs have told me that mine is a tricky case in terms of prognosis and Tx options.  I guess that's the best way I can explain it. Don't get me wrong, I am very optimistic about my prognosis, and feel fortunate that we found the CA so early, and that it is a very treatable type.  It's just these are the things that made deciding on a Tx regimen rather complicated, for my docs and for me.Even the tumor board where my case was studied was mixed. The other interesting things (which no one really knows how to interpret) are that I have several autoimmune diseases, which indicates that my immune system is overactive.  And one of my autoimmune diseases struck when I was 33 and caused my ovaries to fail putting me instantly into menopause, so for a woman of my age (39), I have had very little estrogen in my system for a long time (postmenopausal now for 4+ years), and yet my estrogen receptor number was 98%. So as the genetics counselor and my onc have said to me, I should have been protected from developing this kind of cancer, or at least I had extra protection than most women of my age for the type of cancer that I have.   Anyway, enough about all that stuff.  The bottom line is I have a very treatable cancer and a positive attitude about my future and about getting through treatment.  Now that the decisions are all made, it doesn't matter anymore if my case is an \"interesting\" one or not. (Hope you're not sorry you asked calamtykel!)",

Getting the start date scheduled was a long arduous process, and almost got stalled again yesterday.  First there had been disagreement among onc.'s about which Tx regimen, then there had been a host of intensive cardiac testing under the care of a cardiologist because I have a history of cardiac problems (not severe though, just enough to make my doctors, and by extension me, concerned about whether I am healthy enough to withstand this Tx at all.  But tests came back good enough to go forward.  Then a week went by while my onc. was trying to reach my psychiatrist about med interactions, what steroids and at what dosages she could give me without  jeopardizing my mental stability, which is usually tenuous at best.  My psych., who has treated me for more than four years now is an excellent doc, top of his field, yada yada, but sucks at returning phone calls.  I've know this about him for a long time, but when I and my onc (the first time) talked to him about being an active participant in my Tx, he was so enthusiastic, said whatever he could do to help, gave her all of his numbers, even his private cell, that I got my hopes up that maybe if it were another physician trying to reach him, then he would be more responsive and return her calls.  But alas, the week went by with her leaving several messages for him (obviously this is a matter of some importance), and getting no return calls.  I was very concerned that my onc wouldn't schedule the Tx until she had a chance to talk to him.  Well, she never did talk to him (as of yesterday at 4:40).  In the meantime, her office had called me Thurs. to tell me that my Tx for Mon. was by no means a sure thing because my ins. co. was playing hardball and kept requesting more and more information before they would approve.  AAAHHH!  I was really upset and nervous.  I've known about my CA since April 22.  That's more than enough time hanging in Limbo Land to drive a person crazy. Plus, more and more, I've been starting to think, \"I have this cancer inside me and it's not waiting for my doctors or my tests, or my insurance company to make up their minds.  It's doing its thing!\"  (Of course, I know that we actually have more time to move through this process than we think or feel, but more than three months?!  Anyway, yesterday, I left a message early afternoon at my onc.'s office asking for the latest.  Got one call that they were still waiting, and doc was still making decisions about the Decadron, and they would call me as soon as something was certain.  So at 4:46, I finally got the call saying I am on for Monday!  Yea!!!.  It was such a relief, because this is the third start date I've been given, and I was ready to shoot someone if this one didn't stand!   My psych. never did get back to my onc. about the med issues (she also wanted to talk to him about a few other things), and I also know that he is going on vacation this week.  I have a really hard time getting angry with my doctors, but I think I'm pretty close on this one. The great news is that my husband is home from his job in Indy and will be able to go with me to my infusion.  Won't be around on Tues. for the Neulasta shot, which has me a little nervous, but I'll make do. So that's my update.  Feeling lucky and relieved to get the show on the road! wherria ",

He ordered an MRI with no contrast, and it is scheduled for Monday, not a moment too soon. My question is about the no contrast part. Can you all think of why he might not have ordered with and without contrast? Is one more effective as a diagnostic test? I would really appreciate any of your advice and wisdom. Thank you so much, and thank you for doing this thread at all! It is a wonderfully generous thing to do. Whitney",

She couldn't even tell me where those signs of degenerative disease were or how extensive or severe. All she said was, \"Dr. Born says to watch it for a while, and if you need to, you can see an orthopedist.\" So I said, \"Well, this pain has been here for at least three months and is getting worse not better.\" So she said, \"Oh, well then maybe you should see someone now. I can give you the number of the ortho's we refer to.\" That was it. As far as the location, as I said, she couldn't tell me, but I'm a little iffy about it anyway, because the pain is not directly on my spine. It's to the right in the sacroiliac area. So not (I don't think) where a disc would be. You know how hard it can be sometimes to pin down the location of pain, but this doesn't feel like it's on my spine. One thing all of this has made me do - and I should have done it long ago - is make an appointment with an MO. I haven't seen my MO for a few years at least, and I wasn't his biggest fan then, so I made an appointment with someone new on Friday. Hopefully he can help me either settle this or feel settled about it.",

I have a couple of questions for the group.  Have any of you experienced tooth/teeth sensitivity since beginning chemo.  I haven't read anything about this, but I have a few teeth that just hurt a little.  I'm not sure if I'm having toothaches from like a cavity or loose filling or something, or if it's just more sensitivity.  Or maybe it's really my guilty conscience getting me back for not having gone to the dentist before chemo started!  Well, okay, I guess that was just one question.  As for the chemo bag thread... I'm not sure if the original question was about what to take on infusion day, or about things to carry with us all the time.  I'll just comment on the latter.  I carry a small make-up bag inside my usual bag.  It contains: toothbrush (extra soft, made for children, so small) and sample-sized toothpaste for when I eat out, anbesol and q-tips for when I need help with mouth sores, hand sanitizer, the smallest size trash bags for vomiting, (I have these planted in my car too), small bottle of Biotene mouth spray for dry mouth, eye drops for dry eyes, sunblock in case it's been too long since I put some on but find myself outside, bandaids and a very small tube of Neosporin in case I get an owie, a small box of animal crackers for nausea, and finally some sanitary wipes for going to the bathroom because when we pee this stuff out, especially with certain drugs, it can irritate the skin down there, even lead to infection.  Oh and of course anti-nausea or any other relevant meds.  The sample section of drug store, and for some reason Bed Bath and Beyond are really good places to look for this stuff.  Hope that helps a little. For those of you struggling with nausea, first of all, I am very sorry.  I don't know what's worse, feeling nauseous and vomiting, or feeling lonely.  I thought I'd mention one drug that hasn't been brought up yet: Kytril.  It's a strong drug, like Emend, stronger than Zofran, much stronger than Compazine. It, like Emend really works best if you \"stay ahead\" of the nausea and take it before you feel nauseous.  I was sent home with Emend, Kytril, Decadron, and Compazine.  I took the Emends for the day or two after Tx they recommend (don't remember how many days), but besides that I found myself taking the Kytril to handle my nausea (and I didn't always \"stay ahead\" of it, but it worked anyway).  For me it worked better and longer than Comp., but didn't make me drowsy or cause se's such as constipation or dizziness nearly as bad as Compazine.  That's not, by the way, to say it didn't make me constipated -- all the anti-emetics and painkillers do, for me anyway, but it wasn't as bad with Kytril as with Compazine.  Anyway, just thought I'd mention it for those of you who are taking all the anti-emetics they've given you but are still having nausea -- might be one to ask your doc about. Lisainglem: I've been using an electric razor, just a cheapy I found at a Walgreens I think, and it works great.  I have lost most of my hair (and as of two days ago my eyebrows and most of my eyelashes too), but some patches are still there.  The electric razor works great to make these unnoticeable. Lizzy: You asked about the length of time for infusions.  I was there for 4 1/2 hrs.  However, I am on different drugs than you, and different regimens take different amounts of time.  Also, I did not meet with my onc that day, and many people do.   Calamtykel: You mentioned in your post that you had had heart \"irregularities\" in the past, but then went on to describe palpitations.  It just made me wonder, because arhythmias and palpitations are very different things.  Did you have both? I have a history of several cardiac issues, but the one that was of particular concern because Adriamycin and some others in that class can cause it too.  I had an arhythmia called a QT prolongation.  It's just what it sounds like the Q wave and the T wave of normal sinus rhythm are too far apart.  There may be other cardiac problems that would affect your eligibility for certain drugs, like an abnormal echo or muga that showed actual muscle or valve problems, but I just thought I'd mention that a Prolonged QT is a big warning flag for certain drugs because the drugs themselves can cause it, and it can lead to a condition called Toursades de Pointes which can be fatal.  Not saying this to scare anybody, just to share what I know based on my own experience.  I had to settle for a less aggressive regimen because my cardiac history is so sketchy, and it makes me very nervous.  Really scared, in fact, that I'm not doing enough to treat the bc adequately.  There were a number of reasons why my onc wanted to put me on a more aggressive plan, but she just couldn't.  My only really helpful way of dealing with this fear is to tell myself that being bc free for the next 40 years isn't going to do me any good if I drop dead of a heart attack in 5! Lizzy: This isn't really what you are talking about with LIfetime Fitness, because I know your goal is to keep exercising, but I thought Id let folks know about something I learned from my gym (Lifetime).  If you are not feeling up for exercising, or want to do lighter exercise from your home, but you have a membership with Lifetime (and I would suggest that anyone in this situation ask whatever gym they belong to about it), you can put your membership on a temporary hold, but once you are better, you can re-activate your membership without paying any of the start-up fees.  It's a good way to save money if you're not planning on using your gym for however many months.  This arrangement does require a letter from your doc.  I would actually suggest that folks ask their gyms if there is a special rate for people suffering from an illness that, under a doc's advisement, would benefit from exercise.  Who knows, maybe it's time to use the Cancer Card.  Better than Visa! Omaz: You were asking about studies pertaining to length/number of Tx's.  I can't point to a specific study, but I will tell you about a website that is very useful for finding studies on anything cancer-related under the sun.  It's the website for the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (asco.org) You may get to it also through cancer.net -- that is their patient site.  Hope that helps.  Good luck to everyone starting tomorrow, and for everyone else, my fingers are crossed that you all have se-easy days! ",

Zachsmom: You go girl! I am very impressed that you'll be running today.  My goal this year was to run in the Chicago marathon, but I wasn't far enough along in training by the time this cancer thing started, so I decided not to, but instead I decided to volunteer at the Breast Cancer Network of strength aid station.  I've never volunteered at a race before, but I decided it would be a good way for me to give something to both the breast cancer cause and to the race I love so much, and I thought it would help me to feel like I'm still connected to running even if I can't do much of it myself right now.  It's been nine years since I ran the Chi marathon, and was really excited about doing it this year, but now I know it will mean even more to me to run it next year after getting through all this.  I usually run with Team in Training (which raises money for the leakemia/lymphoma society, but next year I think I'll run with a breast cancer group and raise money for that instead. Anyway, you probably won't read this before the race, but I wish you the best run of your life anyway! lisasinglem: Wow! I didn't realize the show was starting so soon.  You've been a real trooper! As tired as I feel these days, I can only imagine what stamina it has taken for you to be at all those rehearsals, being on your feet all that time, and having to be \"on\" and, I imagine, having to prove to everyone that you are strong enough to do what needs to be done.  I'm proud of you! I bet you are probably somewhat on cloud nine after such a great show, but how are you holding up physically after all this? I do believe it's true that the more active your are, and the more you manage to live your life the way you usually would, the better you are in fighting the fatigue, but you have gone above and beyond!  I am rooting for you next weekend with your Tx followed by three weekend shows! You have all of our support and confidence behind you!  (But don't forget to come to us if it gets hard.) As for me, I'm just trying to keep my emotional head above water.  I'm not feeling bad about my cancer or Tx's.  I've had a rough time with se's, but I still have a very positive attitude about the whole thing in general and the Tx's in particular.  They're hard, but I've faced worse.  It's other stuff (combined with the drain and discomfort of cancer Tx I suppose) going on that is making things particularly difficult for me.  I find inspiration by thinking about all the millions of people in the world (and I think particularly of stories I've been told about my family and all my ancestors had to go through just to survive) who have had to deal with exponentially more difficult things.  For example, my husband's grandfather was in Germany during WWI, and his troops were very close to the Russian front line.  A battle broke out, and suddenly he found himself behind enemy lines with a bullet in his back after his troops had pulled back.  He hid out with no food or water and a bullet in a pile of concrete from a fallen building.  He hid there in a crevice for three days and nights before the Russian soldiers had pulled out, then set out walking by himself.  He ended up making his way on foot all the the way to Poland where a farm woman found him and nursed him back to health over a few months time.  Then I think of my grandmother whose husband suffered a stroke in the early fifties which paralyzed him almost completely from the neck down.  At that time, there were no good options for long-term care, especially since she had only a very small pension from the railroad where my grandfather worked. So she took care of him almost single-handedly in their home for seven years before he finally died. Can you imagine? So I think of people like them, and so many more, and I say to myself, \"If those people were strong enough to get through those things, then there's no reason why I can't be strong enough to get through this!\" Anyway, that's how I keep going, even now, when I'm not doing particularly well. Best wishes to all for a good day!",

I had to leave my job I loved (as a minister of a large congregation) six years ago when the worst of the bipolar began to manifest.  Fortunately I had been wise enough and able to invest in disability insurance while I was working, because my disease has definitely been disabling.  I've been in and out of hospitals, have been on practically every med in the PDR, but I tend to be medication resistant, and I tend to get the rarest of side effects (been true about chemo too), and I have had 40+ electroconvulsive therapy treatments, all to keep me alive and safe. I see a therapist twice a week (used to be five, but had to ease off for financial reasons) and my psychiatrist once a week.  Twice during chemo, my psychiatrist has put me on the schedule for ECT's, but both times I ended up being too sick from chemo to be in the hospital! Many things can trigger a bipolar episode, including physical trauma (like two surgeries and chemo), situational things, like having cancer or having your beloved dog die in the middle of it all, poor sleep (like the kind you get when you wake up four or five times a night with nights sweats), porr nutrition (like when you can barely eat from chemotherapy), and others. Oddly enough, my mental status has not been very affected at all by having cancer.  My dog's death did, however, begin a downward spiral of depression which my psychiatrist is on top of to the best of his ability, and the fatigue of treatments have triggered both depressive and manic episodes, because perhaps the best weapon I have in my mental health arsenal is staying active and out of the house.  Treatment has made that harder, and sometimes I cycle into depression, and sometimes into a very agitated, racing mania.  I'm lucky that my oncologist, psychiatrist and therapist are all working closely together, watching my weight, my moods, even coordinating together what drugs are safe and which ones would be riskier to my mental status.  That is why I don't take the steroids.  Anyway, that's enough about my history, more than you all probably ever wanted to know. Suffice it to say, I am very steeped in and intimate with the world of mental illness and the medicine that used to treat it.  In large part by way of my (and my family's) experience with it, but also because, as with everything else, I always research the hell out of everything. The posts about depression and medication made me nervous as I read them, because I didn't know what was coming.  However, Gingerbrew, I have to say that I agree that there is a point to be made about the not-too-rare cases of over-diagnosis of depression, particularly in children.  Research supports this. Research also suggests that because in the United States pharmaceutical companies are allowed to advertise (unlike in other countries), many people are receiving psychiatric medications (which often have serious side effects) who would benefit just as well from \"talk therapy.\" There is a lot of discussion about these issues in the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association -- not just in magazines like O, or Health or Psychology Today (which really has nothing to do with psychology anyway!  Anyway, my point is that I am very glad you posted about your hurt and angry feelings, and I share you sensitivity to uneducated comments about mental illness or its treatment, but also that I think there are some problematic issues that culturally need to be addressed in terms of how to diagnose clinical depression, how to determine who needs what kind of treatment, etc.  My case is clear.  Your case sounds very clear, but there is a population out there which is less clear, which, I believe was the population to which lisainglem was referring.   As for whether this is an appropriate site to discuss these issues, I feel mixed.  No this forum does not  exist to discuss psycological or psychiatric illnesses.  However, a fair number of our sisters here are dealing, many for the first time, with depression, and some have required medication for it.  So I would hate for the topic to become taboo on this forum.  So my suggestion would be that we all just be wise enough to understand that there are varying degrees of mental illness, a wide range of experience with and understanding of it (including some who have struggled mightily with it for much of their lives, and some who are encountering it for the first time because of bc and what it does to their bodes, including disrupting brain chemistry), and that we be open to learning more about it as it pertains to everything else we are going through right now.  Above all, it is an issue which needs to be addressed with respect and understanding.  I have every faith that this group of amazing, intelligent, and compassionate women have the ability to do all of that and to be carefully supportive of each other. There.  Sorry if that sounded too much like I lecture.  I just had to respond because I I share Gingerbrew's sensitivity around this issue and was somewhat relieved to read her post, but also because I don't want us to create a climate in this forum which means so much to us all in which there are relevant topics that no one is comfortable to talk about. Love and hugs to all my Chemosabes. ",

And if you're still having pain from all the coughing, ask for Flexeril or something like it to relax those muscles.  Every time I get bronchitis (fairly regularly), they give me flexeril (a muscle relaxant) to ease the pain from all the coughing and spasms.  I do hope you feel better soon.  Just remember, no question is too small for your onc; no question should go unanswered.  It's what they're there for. Better safe than sorry. Rachel: Congratulations to you on the Run/Walk for the Cure, and Happy Thanksgiving! beau: While the Decadron \"crash\" can be very difficult, it sounds to me like this is more than just a crash.  In my amateur  opinion, like these symptoms are being caused by the Decadron itself, not the withdrawal from it.  Decadron can have powerful effects on mood - everything from depression to mania, irritability, agitation, apathy, paranoia.  You might want to consider calling your onc (I would definitely do this) and tell him/her what happened, and even talk about a smaller dose next time, or increasing anti-anxiety meds, or even skipping the steroids altogether.  I don't take the Decadron at all (not even in the infusion) because of my bipolar disorder, and I do fine without it.  I took it the first Tx, and realized it was too dangerous for me, so asked to be taken off it.  My onc and psychiatrist agreed.  Since then, I have found all the other support meds take care of me just as well without it. Above all, lay out in detail for your onc what you experienced, and tell him/her that you are concerned about it happening again, ESPECIALLY if you have a history of depression or anxiety.  Hope that helps and that you're feeling better. As for me, had my 4th Tx on Tues., and it went fine, although, like so many others have said, I'm sure starting to understand the whole cumulative effect thing!  And here's a question: has anyone lost nails or had fingernail pain?  I haven't with the first 3 Tx's, but this time, I woke up Wed. morning feeling like my nails had been smashed with a hammer, and they're just getting worse.  I'm afriad I'm going to lose them.  I've used ice and tea tree oil (heard about that somewhere), but my onc nurse told me that the ice doesn't actually help and that if it's going to happen, it's going to happen. Has anyone had this kind of pain? Any advice? Info?  Another thing, I saw my gyne on Friday for my regular pap test, and she was very concerned because my uterus was severely deviated to the left side.  I've had gynecological problems before, and have had to have three biopsies (OUCH!), but not this.  She said, could be a cyst, could be a tumor, could be a bowel thing, although, she did a rectal (my best day ever!), and didn't seem to think that was it.  She didn't have time in that appt. to do an ultrasound, so scheduled me for this Fri to do one.  Another thing to worry about. Also, as I've mentioned before, I have a lump under my arm, on the non-affected side, and the other day, my physical therapist discovered two more lumps on my arm on the affected side, and said they need to be checked out.  So I'm seeing my onc on Tues. for that.  One more thing, has anyone else been diagnosed with lymphedema.  I have, and it sucks! My left arm is about a third bigger than my right.  I haven't been able to wear my wedding ring since my first surgery at the beginning of June, and it just seems to be getting worse.  I wear a compression sleeve already, but my PT has ordered a new one that will go all the way down my hand, and also this nighttime garment that looks like a giant oven mitt that goes from fingers to shoulder. Fun days! Sorry to dump so much, but I'm having a hard time.  And on top of that, both of my parents are having pretty serious health issues, and I'm in Chicago, and they are in Texas.  I wish I could be there, but I just can't. On the brighter side, the Chicago Marathon is this weekend.  Early this year I had planned and begun to train for it, but then got sick and realized this wasn't going to be my year.  So instead I'm going to join a group of volunteers with Network of Strength at one of the aid stations handing out drinks and food to the runners, and helping whomever might need it.  I figured it would be a good way for me to feel useful and still feel connecting to my running life and to this marathon, which is a particular love of mine.  Wish me luck that I am feeling up for it.  It's a long day, and I'll be on Day 6 which is typically a se-heavy day for me.  I have to be there before 6:00 am, and they ask that you stay til at least 12:00 to help with clean-up, although I'm sure they would understand if I needed to leave early.  Also it will be cold and probably kind of windy and moist.  I will bundle up, and if I can manage it, I know it will be a blast.  If I can't I will be totally bummed, so please do wish me luck! Thanks. Whitney ",

My very close friend whom I see almost every day, who has been very involved with my cancer career, from reading about it, talking about it, to going to doctor appt.'s -- all of which makes me very grateful -- is driving me crazy with this one little thing.  Keep in mind I'm venting here. I've been very committed throughout this whole thing not to complain too much.  And I don't mean that in a martyrish way.  I'm not trying to just keep a smile on my face to make people think that I'm some kind of Cancer Superwoman, or to pretend that this isn't hard.  I try to stay positive when I talk to people for a few reasons.  One, I think that the more positive I can be on the outside (as long as it is genuine), the more positive I will be on the inside. Two, even though this is very hard, and my body is traumatized, sick, and hurting in two dozen different ways, I know that, big picture, compared to what it could be, it's not THAT horrible, and if I talk about it like it is, then I will start to feel and act like it is.  I know I feel crappy, but I don't want to create this world in my head wherein this crappiness is the worst crappiness ever, and no one has ever felt this bad... You know what I mean.  I don't want the sickness to take over -- in how I feel about my life, how I feel about others, what I feel I am capable of, etc. So my goal has been to be honest, but in a humble and positive way that both does justice to what I'm feeling and recognizes and affirms all that I have to be grateful for, including the strength I have to get through this.  Okay, that said... As the chemo has taken its toll, and my body has had its occasional ups and frequent downs, when my friend calls and asks how I'm doing, I have to say, more and more \"I'm not feeling very well\" or something like it.  No big deal right?  My friend, who has been through this with me every step of the way should understand that cancer and chemo make you feel unwell.  And she does understand that. I know she does.  But she ALWAYS responds with, \"Why? What's the matter?\"  Now, understand, it's not with a tone in her voice like, \"Uh-oh, something's wrong or worse\" or anything like that.  Her tone has this lilt to it, like \"Why whatever could you mean?\" I know it's just a thing she says.  I know she knows I am sick.  But it is so confounding and irritating, to have to tell her EVERY time she asks how I'm doing, WHY I don't feel well.  Okay, I could go on, but I think you get the picture.  Basically, when she does this, I want to grab her by the neck and shake her and scream, \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT'S WRONG??? I HAVE CANCER, REMEMBER??  I'M IN CHEMO!! REMEMBER THAT FROM OUR LAST CONVERSATION???? AND MY BODY IS UNDER ATTACK, AND IT MAKES ME NOT FEEL WELL!!! DO YOU GET IT???\" Whew! That felt good.  Thanks.",

Among other things, I wish this thrush would clear up.  Don't y'all just hate that?! Anyway, very little nausea left to speak of, still having pain in muscles, and muscle spasms that literally cause me to crumple to the floor on occasion, and of course the fatigue and shortness of breath, but other than that, I'm feeling better.   And my dh came home from Indianapolis Sunday night.  Of course he started a new commercial on Monday and just got done last night.  So I really haven't seen him for more than a few hours since he got home (when he's on a shoot it starts early and goes late).  But, and here's the kicker, he's turning around and going back to Indianapolis tomorrow for another two week shoot! And I have my last chemo next Wednesday I was hoping he could go to.  :( Brian has a very good reputation in Chicago as an Art Director, and now I guess he's getting to be well-known in Indy because a lot of producers there have been calling for him more and more.  Most of the commercials you see on TV with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning he art directed in Indy, and now a bunch of other types of shoots too.  So, I'm wondering, is he going to traveling there even more? He can't ignore his producers and directors in Chicago who hire him, because if he does, they'll start to look for someone else, but when there's a good job offer, in this business, you just can't say no.  And the winter months tend to be slow, so he can't afford to say no when there's work.  It's a very fickle business -- sometimes booming, sometimes very slow.  Anyway, I will miss him, and am not looking forward to going through another chemo cycle all by myself again. Boo hoo, poor me.   On the up side, my girlfriend is out of the hospital, and we will have to be careful about not getting sick from each other (she has neutropenia), at least I'll get to see her more.   And after having a very good time with my friend, Justin, who was in town this past weekend, another dear friend, Terasa, is coming for a day and a night this weekend, so that should be fun, and it's before my next treatment, so I won't be too sick and oogey to enjoy our time together. My biggest concern right now is my lymphedema.  I've been upgraded to 5-day-a-week therapy because things have been getting worse, but the good news is that I get to go to my first therapist again.  She had to take time off work in order to have elbow surgery, but she's back as of this week.  Yay!  She is so much better than the other two therapists I've seen. Well, I hope all who are having treatments have an easy time, and all who are fighting se's get some relief and comfort, and basically just hugs and good wishes to us all.",

But about a year ago, my annual mammogram showed \"architectural distortions.\" I went to my BS, who did not think a biopsy was necessary. I didn't feel settled with that, so I got a second opinion. She was an MO, and she agreed with my BS. But on the report, the radiologist had said that further investigation was advised. So I kept pushing, ended up talking to two oncologists, three radiologists and my GP, my GP being the only one who thought a biopsy was called for. Everybody else said no. So I went back to my BS and told her that I didn't feels comfortable, and that I was thinking about having a prophylactic BMX. Oh, this was on the other breast, by the way, from my initial cancer. So she did the BMX, and told me afterward that they had found extensive DCIS, what she called pre-cancer. I was pretty fed up with her by that time and didn't ask a lot of questions, which is not like me at all! There was a lot going on in my life right then, including a few other serious medical problems, so I just kind of let it slide by. My question is this: would that have been considered a recurrence (local?)? Would that change my stage at all? I feel silly that I don't know those basic things about my own cancer, but there it is. Thank you to anybody who can weigh in on this. Whitney",

Second, maybe I was in a little denial and wasn't as scared as I might've been. Third, though, is I'm not sure if I should consider this test conclusive. I don't know how significant the contrast issue is. And we all know that bc mets can sneak past any imaging test. All of this adds up to my feeling that there's more to this to explore. What do y'all think? Whitney",

(That's not an official holiday, just my name for my first Tx Day -- feel free to apply it to any day you like!) Well, I woke up in a better mood today than I have tasted in a long time.  Two reasons: finally, I get to start my chemo after more than three months of having it hanging over my head -- finally the unknown will become known and finally, with no more decisions to be made, I can feel like I am actively fighting this disease.  And second, because (it's funny you mentioned it calamtykel), I decided a few days ago that I wanted to go for a run on my first day.  I used to run marathons, then had a long hiatus from running due to injuries and other things, have started and stopped a few times in the last year, but I have really longed to get back to it seriously, but have let myself feel sidelined by the BC and two surgeries.  Almost talked myself out of it last night because my Tx team is worried about my weight being too low, and didn't want to dehydrate myself.  But I woke up at 5:00 this morning and said, \"Phooey on all that, I want this fight to be on my terms!\"  So I drove to a lovely forest preserve and ran for a little over a mile, not that much I know, but not bad for not having run in so long, came back, took a cool shower, pampered myself with nice oils and lotions, now sitting down to a little coffee, lots of water, and I feel great!  I highly recommend finding some way to make our Tx days belong to us and not to cancer. On another topic, I'm interested in hearing more about how everyone is thinking about how to decide when to shave the fur.  I'm really considering doing it early (again, I want things on my terms, and I'm tired of having it hanging over my head), but there's some voice in my head telling me that this would be a weird thing for me to do, or maybe I think other people wouldn't understand why I would want to go bald even a minute before I had to.  I don't know.  My husband thinks it's a great idea, proactive, strong.  So does my best friend.  I know it's my thing and shouldn't depend on what other people think, but I still feel stuck. Anyway, I'd love to get your thoughts on this and to know how y'all are coming along with it.  Thanks.  Good luck to everyone today, whether it's your first Tx, 3rd, or any day in between.  And thanks also to Lizzymack for being our committed, fearless leader.  I'm so grateful that you're doing what you're doing. wherria If anyone needs a motto for the day, try this one: \"The earth is crammed with heaven.\"  Elizabeth Barrett Browning ",

Zachsmom: I hope you are able to get bak to exercising soon.  And I totally get your image of being, \"strong, muscular, and well, bald.\" It resonates with me too.   Rachel: Thanks for letting us know that you're going to shave around the day of your first Tx.  I have to say, I'm leaning more and more toward getting my hair shaved this week.  It felt so good to get my first Tx out of the way (My Terms and all) and not have it hanging over my head, I think embracing my baldness now instead of having it hanging over my head, pardon the pun, would be a good thing. Calamtykel: Good for you for not giving up your running.  Especially since you're fairly new to it and in that \"this is great; I love it; it's making my life better\" stage of the running experience.  It's an important time for you to keep it in your life. Thanks also for the M.J. Fox quote.  It's a great one. As for the baldness/hat thing, I highly recommend taking a few fun-day hat/scarf shopping sprees with your dh and/or close friend. It helped me to frame it as a fun thing to do to get ready to have fun with all the hat/scarf possibilities there are.  Pretty, fun, simple, flashy, grungy, young, sophisticated, silly, elegant -- you can find whatever you're looking for.  BTW, I have found that dept. stores don't have the best selection, but a lot of the other smaller stores in any given mall will have more selections than you might think, and often, especially in store for younger people, less expensive.  I know there are good websites for this shopping, but I found, for me seeing them and trying them on, helped me think of it all in a more positive and creative way.  Taking someone good along with you is key, though.  Otherwise it could turn lonely and sad.  Besides they're the ones who will look at you when you try them on, and smile like when they first met you and began to discover your beauty and cuteness, and say things like, \"that looks precious on you!\" or \"that would look beautiful with your blue dress!\"or \"you HAVE to buy that hat!\"   BTW all, I also recommend doing a google search for \"cancer boutiques\" or cancer store\" or \"cancer products\"  or similar searches in your area.  I have found several little stores in my area (western suburbs of Chicago) that sell cancer products. My favorite one is called A Woman's Place Inc. located in Naperville, IL.  It is run by a woman who has battled CA four times and decided this is what she wanted to do with her life.  She sells everything from post-mx bras, to prosthetics, to wigs/hats/scarves of all kinds, to jewelry, to lymphedma compression sleeves (although beware of buying one of those without a professional fitting by a doc, or physical or occupational therapist) to CA skin/hair care products, etc.  The last time I was in, I was post-mx and gearing up for chemo and buying hats.  She told me, whenever you're ready to shave your head come back and I'll do it for free.  She said she is trained to do it, has the right products to use, and it's just something she decided she could do to give back.  So that's where I'll go.  She, like most of these stores, does take insurance for things that are covered as long as you bring your info and do'c script or order. Like you, calamtykel, I'm still kind of ambivalent about the wig thing.  I think I would hardly wear one, but my husband do do things like symphony concerts and theatre, etc.  And maybe I would want one for those kinds of things, but I just don't know if it's worth getting one. Lisa: Glad Tx went well.  Thanks for letting me know about getting your head shaved.  I bet your dh will wind up thinking you're cute bald.  You have such an attractive, pleasant face, I can see it looking totally adorable on you!",

I woke up this morning at about 4:45, tee shirt and pajama bottoms thrown to the floor because I was having a doozy of a hot flash, thinking, \"I really would like to sleep some more.\"  But alas, I was wide awake.  So as I pondered whether to laze in my bed for a little longer being frustrated about being awake, or just bite the bullet and get up (where does that phrase come from I wonder... huh), I thought, \"Well, if I get up, at least I will have something nice to do.  I can go online and check in on my cancer buddies.\"  And that's what I did.  So thank you all for being such a unique and valuable source of support and connection.   First of all, good luck CindyRN on your first Tx today!  I think you're the only one starting today, but if there are others, then by all means, good luck to you too!  I know you know this, but don't stop drinking all that water for a few more days at least.  It really will help. Second, Michelle, lisaattheshore, Lisbeth, Zenith, and libraylil (And any others I've missed), how are you all doing leading up to your Tx's tomorrow? Anything we can do to help? My update... I think the nurse practitioner was wrong about my having shingles.  I just don't think I do.  First of all, the pain I'm having in my back (which seems to be subsiding a little each day) is not in the same place as the rash, which is on my shoulder/neck area).  Also, the pain is muscular.  Shingles brings on that unmistakable nerve pain that causes you to pray to any possible deity every time air touches your skin.  This is not nerve pain.  So I don't know what the rash is about.  It's not going away, but I don't think it's getting worse either.  I may call again today.  I'm starting to feel like a pest around there and I'm only on my first Tx!  (I hate feeling like a pest, and I feel that way very easily when it comes to calling my doctors.)  I don't have a fever anymore.  Mouth sores are still there, but I can deal with them now, with the help of my newly designated Oral Care Medicine Cabinet filled with fun-to-taste mouth rinses, analgesics, and a variety of application utensils. So should I call, or just rub dirt in it and wait til my appt. next week? calamtykel: Yea for having no mets!  Ready for chemo on Mon.? Ann97: Just a suggestion about the half marathon, if you decide not to run in it, consider being an aid station volunteer.  It may help you feel that connection to the running community we all love so much, even if you have to push your own training back a little.   Mmahle: Funny how doing housework can feel like such an accomplishment isn't it? I'm looking around me right now and considering flying you in from wherever you are for a few hours in my house! Zenith: I like what you said about adjusting to reality.  I share your philosophy.  I believe that success (at least as we Americans tend to think about it) is getting what you want, while happiness is wanting what you get.  Just my pithy little contribution for the day! Hope everyone has a good day, and, as always, I look forward to reading more... ",

Top picks for lip balm???  Note: I do not want to smell or taste like a strawberry Skittle, nor do I want to look like someone sprayed my face with high gloss enamel.  I just want to keep my lips from cracking open, and if possible, to get rid of this feeling like my lips are as thick as a cow's hide. 2.) Anyone else experiencing chemo brain yet?  Yesterday, after getting my dogs' dinners ready, I put the now half-empty (ok, half-full) can of dog food in the cupboard drawer and the saran wrap I used to seal it up into the refrigerator!  I knew something wasn't right, but it took a minute for me to figure out what that was.  I'm truly afraid of this becoming a serious issue -- like, am I safe to drive? can I be trusted to make sure I've taken all my meds or to remember all my appointments? etc. When a friend called yesterday around 5:00 and asked what I had done all day, I honestly could not remember anything except that I had gone to a bookstore.  The rest of the day was a blank. I've started posting little notes around the house to remind me of things, like to make sure I've turned the oven off, or locked the doors at night, or that I have everything I need with me when I leave the house.  Anyone going through this? Thanks ",

I have not posted in a while -- preoccupied by other stuff I guess -- but I have been silently checking in on y'all and following along.  I have a few comments on some issues that have been raised, and then I'll fill you in on how I'm doing, etc. Adey: You remarked in your post that in this litigious society of ours, recording dr's appointments would never be possible.  That is wrong.  You have every right to record your dr. sessions.  I recorded every appointment I had, especially at first when everything was new and each appt. was packed with new information.  I did it with my bs, my surgeon, the several onc's that I saw, and not one of them had a problem with it, as well they should not.  In fact, they were very encouraging and understanding about it, patiently waiting for me to set up my recorder, etc. You need not be embarrassed or self-conscious about it because you are there to understand critical things about YOUR health, not to be intimidated by a dr's ego or impatience (which I never encountered). If you run across an onc who is uncomfortable being recorded, then first I would ask why, and then explain that you are overloaded/overwhelmed by all the info. and simply want to make sure you can remember and understand what is being said to you.  However, you shouldn't have to explain this at all (I never had to), and if your onc still says no, I would seriously question why and possibly even consider another onc.  If the onc is not confident enough about what s/he is saying to you to be recorded, then this might be a warning flag about his/her competence/confidence as an onc.  My experience with this has been a non-issue.  I think oncs (and docs of all kinds, especially specialists) are used to this by now, and if they aren't I would really wonder why it makes them so uncomfortable. Gingerbrew: a hearty echo of congratulations to you and your family! I am so happy for you!  I am assuming from your post that everything went well , and that everyone is healthy. If you don't mind my asking, what is the new grand baby's name? Sohard: I am sorry you are having such a difficult time with your bleeding. But please don't worry about posting \"personal stuff\" here. We're all going through a lot of personal stuff, physically and emotionally, and being able to talk about it all, seeking and giving advice and empathy is why we are all here.  So I say, \"Let it all come out!\"  What do we have to be embarrassed about anyway? So I promise to talk about my constipation/diarrhea issues if you promise to go on talking about your bleeding or anythings else for that matter!  Deal? (As for the constipation issue, my onc gave me detailed instructions for dealing with this.  It's all laid out in a chart for which I can't replicate here, but in a subsequent post I will do my best to detail the information.)  A few people mentioned not knowing how to tie scarves.  Some places that you order from will send along instructions for this, and some websites even have video/YouTube illustrations.  I know that headcoverings.com is one that sends instructions with your order.  I know there are others too, but can't remember which ones.  Maybe others will know. I am feeling sort of normal by now.  I'm on Day 15.  Days 3-10 were pretty miserable, though even then I was usually still able to get out of the house and tend to some of my regular daily activities.  But since Day 10 or 11 I've been gaining a little more strength, stamina and relief each day.  I've been running a little, and my dh and I even played racquetball yesterday.  (I won one game out of two.) For those of you who have expressed your interest, my dog, Bixby, is hanging in there, but he's had a rough several days.  The meds he is on for this autoimmune disease have caused terrible weakness and muscle atrophy, so there are times when he can't stand up from a lying position because his hind legs are so weak, so we have to lift his hind quarters up for him.  Once he's up, he can walk and is still interested in things, though.  I don't think he's in pain, just weak, which will hopefully improve as we begin to wean him off the meds next week. But we did have to go into the vet for a surprise visit this weekend.  Scared me, but turned out sort of okay.  It's just that it breaks my heart to see him like this. That's about it for me.  Thank you to all who responded about my mouth sores.  They are MUCH better, hardly noticeable, really, and I have another week of enjoying a clear mouth before I have to do it again. Welcome to all the newcomers.  This group has been a tremendously valuable find for me, and I hope it is for you too!  And good luck to everyone beginning their treatments this week.  We will all be thinking of you! ",

I don't mean to feel sorry for myself, I really don't, but Last year, before I was diagnosed I was training to run the 2010 Chicago.  Then cancer things got moving, and despite my best efforts to keep running, I just wasn't able to. So during treatment, I told myself, vehemently I might add, that next year chemo would be over, and I would be able to get back to my training, and I would run in the 2011.  Nobody told me then, that I would continue to fee like roadkill for another year or two.  Nobody told me, I was going to gain a hundred pounds (okay, an overstatement, but it feels that way). And nobody mentioned that my muscles would not only atrophy from lack of use, but that the enzymes would actually be broken down and replaced with fat cells leaving my body weaker, ys, but also in an entirely different shape.  Anyway, here I am, now, maybe able to run two miles. Am I sad about this? Yes.  Disappointed?  Angry and frustrated with myself for not pushing myself more and trying harder? Yes.   However, I am not resigned.  I have continued to have many health problems since my diagnosis last year, some cancer-related, some not, and so I have had to keep telling myself, whether I believe it or not, that I have done the best I could with what I had.  And above all, I need to resist the temptation to look back, and focus on the now and look to the future.  I WILL RUN RUN THE CHICAGO MARATHON IN 2013! But that's not my only goal.  I want to pick a 10k or half marathon to run maybe in April or May.  I'm trying to get my sister to run with me.  She lives in TX and I am, of course, in Chicago, but I've asked her to start training so we can run a race together sometime in the spring.  She used to run and enjoyed it a lot, but had a meniscus injury that has left her unable to do a lot of exercise, except swimming and lifting.  But, I told her that if there is a way, if there is a sugeon, if there is a treatment that will help her rund again, then I will find it!  I have a pretty good grasp of medicine for a lay person, and I have had so many illnesses over the years that I have become an expert at navigating our healthcare system.  So I will do my best to keep that promise.  Wish me luck!! Lizzy, how's the rash?  Yesterday or the day before (I can't remember which) you said the med for the itching was working, but that the rash wasn't really improving.  Still true, or are you seeing some of it shrinking? Tex, I will be thinking of you and praying for you, that you get good news tomorrow.   Cal, are you feeling better? Recovered? Is anyone else out there running, or, as in my case, trying to run?",

It's been very hard that way.  Lonely.  And he hasn't been to doc appointments and stuff so isn't very informed, and I have to explain things to him, and it's tiring and hard not to feel bad about it.  But hopefully that's all over for awhile (though chemo's over).  Maybe he can kind of get caught up on things.  I told him there's a book I wanted him to read about what it's like when cancer treatment ends and what you still have to go through, and what the challenges are in moving on.  He said that sure he would read it.  I hope he does.  Anyway, didn't mean to spill like that.  He is a wonderful, emotionally available and supportive person, and I don't resent any of this.  It's just wonderful to have him back. And since we didn't know when he was going to be home, we didn't invite any guest or take any invitations for Thanksgiving dinner, so I made reservations at a favorite, very nice restaurant for us, and I think I like it better that way.  It's been so long since we've been together for any length of time when he wasn't rushing around getting ready for work or worn out at the end of the day, that it will be fantastic to sit in a luxurious restaurant, eat delicious food, not be in a rush, no pressure, just talking!   I haven't been posting lately because, well, frankly I've been really manic lately and when I am, it's very hard for me to settle down and read and write.  But I've been very productive.  Yesterday, I was pretty sick, but still wired, so I spent hours making Christmas decorations for my house.  I went to Hobby Lobby and just bought a bunch of stuff that I thought I could put together creatively, and made three different table center pieces, one for our dining room, and one each for our two living rooms, and they turned out so beautifully!  I was kind of impressed with myself, actually.  (Mania often brings with it more than usual creative thoughts and energy -- one of the few positives of living with bipolar disorder!).  Anyway, it was fun. Se-wise, I'm one week out of my last Tx, and not feeling well.  All kinds of stuff, but I won't go into it -- we all know what the stuff is! Ginger, I too am having a lot of issues with neuropathy.  My onc was very cautious, and I think a little unsure about doing my last Tx, but I opted for it anyway. But I am worried about it.  My feet are an issue, but my hands are worse.  While I was making decorations yesterday, one of them required me to make little knots with monofilament, and I had to use a needle threader and tweezers to do it, because my fingers were too numb to use them to make the knots.  Also, I am a pianist, and I am VERY worried that I won't be able to play like before.   It's been interesting to witness how we have all gone through this process together, from worrying about losing hair, making treatment decisions, choosing doctors, to discovering side effects, feeling positive and optimistic about how well we were going to get through Tx's with our lives intact (like exercising), to finding out maybe it wasn't going to be that easy, to feeling down, frustrated, impatient with friends/family, enormously grateful for friends/family, to looking forward to things winding down or at least moving on to the next steps, to some of us reaching the end of chemo and having all kinds of mixed feelings about that, worries about and problems with radiation, getting ready for more surgeries, etc.  How much we have been through together!  And I don't know about y'all, but this experience wouldn't have (or wouldn't be) anywhere near as withstandable (is that a word?) without this group.  Even my friends and family have come to rely on their own relief and appreciation that I have this group.  They are always asking, \"What do the women in your group say about that?\" or \"How are your chemosabes doing?\" or \"Have you talked to your group about this?\"  I think they know I get things from you all that I can't get from them.  It has been a true gift, and I plan to continue being part of this group for as long as it stays together, and I hope that's a long time. For those of you having a hard time or feeling sick, I hope you get a reprieve soon! For those of you who have reached the end of chemo, congratulations!  It's a huge accomplishment, even if it is a little anti-climactic!  For those of you having some good days, go for it and enjoy every minute! For everyone, big hugs and love from one woman who's very grateful today FOR YOU!",

Michelle: Very happy for you that your SE's has been relatively mild so far, and thrilled to hear that you are feeling so much better.  May it continue to be so! sptmm: Glad to hear your first Tx went so well, and that so far it's been tolerable.  Sorry about the reaction and the hives, though.  I can imagine that, at the time, aside from being extremely uncomfortable, it must have stirred up a little (or more than a little) fear about what would come next.  Glad it worked itself out! lizzymack: Thinking of you trying on your new hats brough a smile to my face.  I happy that you like them.  I'm sure you are going to look adorable.  I've bought a lot of hats and scarves too, and had some sent to me as gifts. I plan to have fun with them, so I've been shopping in store for teenagers, because they seem to have the most hats and scarves that are fun, cool, and imaginative (and much less expensive) than other stores.  I recommend it!  My husband and I have made several outings to different malls and just wandered through the \"juniors\" stores, and have found a lot of fun things. And for the days I choose to go bald, I'm thinking of writing on my head in bright red bold letters, \"Insert Hair Here!\" with arrows pointing out in four directions! (By the way, I told my surgeon, and I swear on my life that I will do it, if I choose to go back for reconstructive, instead of a fake nipple and tattooed areola, I'm going to forgo the nipple and have my tattoo look like this: .  My dh thinks it's hysterical, and I really want to do it! zenith: I hear what you're saying about not being too comfortable with the war analogies, but I do like yours at the end, that your hair is one of the soldiers being sacrificed.  I would add to that, that when we go through a SE like hair loss, it can serve as a reminder to us that the medicine is doing what it's supposed to do.  It's working. Lisa; I sympathize with both you and your husband regarding the argument you mentioned.  All the unknowns are frustrating for everyone (though, if you, or anyone else is like me, I really wish my dh would do more of his own research so that I don't always have to explain everything to him to make sure he understands what's going on -- they should be going through it with us, and for me, that includes educating themselves the way we have to educate ourselves).  Anyway, you mentioned that you know everyone keeps telling you that \"everyone's different...\" I, myself, am getting tired of hearing MYSELF have to say over and over to people that everyone's different!",

IowaSue: No, not everyone loses their hair.  It all depends on which drugs you're getting.  Your onc should be able to tell you if you will or not.  As for the support meds, I'm taking most of them.  Not sleep meds or anti-anxiety meds, though, because I'm already on them thanks to my psychiatrist.  I'm not taking very many anti-emetics though, partly because I don't think I need them all (I'm on TC and that tends to cause less nausea than some other regimens), and in part because they are very constipating.  I'm only on Day 3, so I figure I still have some figuring out to do about how to balance anti-nausea, anti-diarrhea, and anti-constipation meds.  Funny thing is I tend to be susceptible to all three, so we'll see how this plays out.  When I got my infusion Monday, I asked the nurse, which my particular cocktail tended to cause more, diarrhea or constipation, and she said diarrhea, so I've taken that into account.  I recommend asking your nurse(s) those kinds of questions.  Nurses have a wealth of knowledge about this stuff and see deal with it and hear about it more than the docs do, so sometimes they can give you more specific advice than the docs. Best wishes to everyone for a good day! ",

IowaSue: I understand what you mean about being anti-med.  I've had to be on an assortment of meds for a long time for other things, but I can't say I'e ever liked it!  When it comes to things like the steroids making you gain weight and things like that, I just keep telling myself that this is temporary, and I will get my body back the way I want it once it's all said and done.  But on the subject of the steroids, just FYI, I am only being given half the dose one would regularly be given because of another med. condition, and have done just fine with the other anti-emetics, so if you're worried about the steroid se's, it may be something to talk to your onc about.  I have found that, even being on a low dose of the dexamethasone I've still needed fewer anti-emetics than they prepared me for.  And, by the way, you can NEVER question too much in this process!  This is your body everyone's talking about, your life.  The better educated you are the better off everyone is, including your docs! Do not be intimidated.  Make sure you get all your questions answered, because you're the one who needs to feel confident in the Tx you're getting.  One tool I use, if I feel like I'm running out of time with my doc or whatever (though, I'm lucky that my onc. is very respectful both of the knowledge I bring into the room, and the questions I have), is to just say,\"I have some more questions/things I'd like to cover.  When might be a good time to do that?\"  Usually, if they are feeling in a hurry or thought the appt. was almost over, this question, in my experience, usually makes them stop or slow down, and say, \"Go ahead, what else are you wondering about?\" or they'll give you a time when they will call your or something like that.  Anyway, it's a way to let them know you need more from them without feeling like you're trying to squeeze in your questions as they're walking out the door.  Just a thought. Scrabblelady: I'm sorry your dh's response isn't more empathetic right now.  I had a similar situation with my dh, who is usually as supportive as they come.  He would just kind of send me signals with his body language or vibe, that he didn't really want to hear about se's.  I figured it was just that they were so hard for him to think about.  So I just told him, that that was the vibe I was getting, that I knew it was scary for him to think about, but that I really needed to be able to talk to him about the se's because they scared me, and (not necessarily in these words, but close) that I didn't have the luxury of not having to think about them, and I didn't want to be alone in that.  It worked.  He apologized, said I was right that his response was coming from his own fear of having to see me go through this, and that he agreed that he needed to, in his words, \"toughen up and stand up\" and be available to me in whatever way I needed him.  I hope you can get to a similar place with your dh.  Calamty: I made an appt. with the oncology nutritionist that works in my onc.'s practice.  Do you think you would want to see one that specializes in onc. nut.? ",

I had to call the day after Tx to ask again which meds to take and in what order (their take-home instructions weren't very thorough).  I left there with four anti-nausea meds and didn't know which to take when, other than Emend each morning for two more days. I don't know about y'all, but when it comes to the anti-emetics, my big fear is getting so darn constipated by them, as I tend toward that direction anyway. So I've tried to take as few of them as possible and in the order of the least constipating (not that I really think I know that very well).  I've also been taking stool softeners at night when I've had to take the anti-emetics.  I guess I'm looking for some very delicate balance between se's of chemo (diarrhea and/or constipation)/se's of anti-emetics' (constipation)/not too many stool softeners vs. not enough... AAAUUGGHHH! Anybody else with me? I figure I'm learning this time around and maybe I'll figure out what works for next time.  I'd love any advice! Also, mlv, I'm sorry about how hard it is to get your children through this with you.  Not something I've had to deal with, as I don't have children, but I'm sympathetic! Who knows, maybe the se's will be manageable and your daughter will get to come home sooner than you planned. I hope the best for all of you. As for you questions about se's of AC vs taxotere, when we were considering that regimen, she too said that the se's from the AC would be harder than the taxotere.  And as for doing more rounds, all I can say is that I've read so much about how the medical community has learned that in the history of CA Tx, we have by far tended to over-treat, whether through surgery, radiation, or chemo, and that we've learned, and keep learning, that more Tx doesn't necessarily mean better prognosis or outcome.    mmahle: Yea for clear PET scan and Echo!  I hope tomorrow goes smoothly and easily. Good luck to everyone starting tomorrow, and, for that matter, everyone else getting through one more day!",

This is kind of a different subject, but for me, it's sort of part and parcel of my cancer experience so far.  The same week I was Dx'd, one of my dogs, Bixby, was Dx'd with a dangerous autoimmune disease (though at first everyone thought it was cancer too).  He's been very sick, and in the middle of running around to all of my appointments and figuring things out for my own Tx, I've been taking him back and forth to vets and animal hospitals trying to get him stable.  He's on powerful immunosuppressants that we really want to get him off of, but we can't until his blood counts are stable for several weeks at least. And even then, if we do get him off the meds, we don't know if he'll just relapse or go into remission.  This morning, I have to drag my achey bones to the vet and get his blood drawn.  I'd appreciate your thoughts/prayers for good results for him today too.  I know this isn't what this list is for, but his illness and mine are emotionally linked in some strange way for me.  I can't describe how much my dogs mean to me.  I don't know what I'd do without them, especially since my husband is gone working most of the time.  It's been really hard taking care of all this stuff without my dh around very much, but I really need to hear some good news about Bixby today, cause I'm worried sick.  Thanks. Lisa: Congrats on getting your head shaved.  I'm so glad you like it.  If my husband isn't working this weekend, I'm shooting for Saturday.  Did I tell you that there's a little cancer boutique owner who has offered to shave my head for free.  She is a wonderful lady and even called me the other night to see how my first Tx went (she had jotted the date down the last time I was there and I mentioned it to her).  Very sweet, and not just a sales tactic.  I can tell she really cares and wants to help other survivors.  Best to all for a good day! ",

It is great to be able to come back here, even though not everyone is checking in much. I miss the connections we all shared here. I am doing ok. Still having health issues, but not directly related to BC. I do think my body has just never returned to its pre-cancer, pre-chemo health. Maybe chemo really does age you ten years! I have never been able to lose the weight I put on during the aromatase inhibitors years. Blah!! But I am not giving up !! Lizzy, congratulations on being in school!! What kind of nursing are you thinking of? Ladyinbama and Gingerbrew, great to hear you are doing well! Would love to hear from others! Does anybody know how Timothea is??  Love you all!",
