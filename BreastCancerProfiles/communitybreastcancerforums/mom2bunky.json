I will always remember you as the very first post where I could try to be useful to someone in all this. Great advice above. I just wanted you to know why I chose this because all the options above with respect to waiting on reconstruction etc are valid. Firstly, I too had massive doubts about the lumpectomy vs bmx, but I was talked down by the breast surgeon that in my case it was a 50/50 choice and that in some studies they're seeing a slight benefit to lumpectomy/radiation over bmx for women in my situation. I got a second opinion, same. It's normal to second guess and worry there's a better choice. Ask questions, don't be shy, and listen. As to the plastics, yes they can wait. Absolutely. I didn't wait because I had never had surgery before in my life and wanted to minimize them. Doctors concurred so fine. I also am older than your wife, nursed a child for two years and wanted something nice to come out of this and vanity prevailed. Bear in mind that symmetry isn't the end goal here. I'll likely have some assymetry especially after radiation they told me. But I wasn't symmetrical to begin with so it's okay. Keep asking questions of your doctors, get that second opinion. Whatever you need so you feel you've made the best, most informed decision for you. You will get there",

      "Content": "May 31, 2019 07:10AM - edited May 31, 2019 07:14AM by mom2bunky I am so happy to find this thread. I am only three weeks out from my lumpectomy and oncoplastic surgery. I'm still sore in the breasts. I suppose it isn't bad, but I feel them. What IS bad are the sharp stabbing pains I get from time to time. They actually seem to be getting more numerous and worse in recent days. I spoke to the breast surgeon about it yesterday and she reminded me that this was normal, nerve endings growing back. They had warned me about the sharp pains, but not the general soreness. Although some soreness makes sense of course, I was just hoping it was temporary. I am dealing with it without any pain killers for the most part, but every once in awhile, like last night, I'll pop an advil or something. It seems to work okay. It's not the end of the world I know, and hopefully it will get better. A friend who is six years out from similar experience says she still gets the stabbing pains once in awhile, but it's not bad. Thank goodness it lasts only seconds because it is stop me in my tracks and let out an uncontrollable \"ouch!\" bad. But how on earth do you ladies handle your mammograms? There is no way in the world I could have one now. The breast surgeon is recommending six months after radiation, which hasn't even started yet. Please tell me the soreness gets better enough to be able to withstand a mammogram. I'm a little freaked out, please tell me the soreness gets better!",

Pain was a half Percocet the first night, mostly to sleep, then Tylenol for two days. I had full arm movement in two days and the drains came out on Monday. I have to say it was easier than I ever imagined. So I am very happy about that. I've not found the courage to look at them yet, but my husband has and is very encouraging that we made the right decision. I can't comment if it's the best way to go for your wife, our diagnoses are different. But I hope my recent experience is helpful to you.  Oh I should add that I was a D/DD depending on the bra, and plastic surgeon told me I\u2019d likely be a B or a small C at most. I\u2019m okay with that, but it\u2019s very personal of course",
