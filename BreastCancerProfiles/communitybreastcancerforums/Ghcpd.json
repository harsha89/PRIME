Still had awful bone pain but at least it fell into the closet to tolerable scale. I can only stand plain water or grape sonic slushes???? Weird! Food is disgusting. But I did find something that had helped me some.. outshine frozen fruit bars and yogurt bars. They are from real fruit and don\u2019t appear to be terrible for you. I really don\u2019t care as long as I get the hydration as a few calories! And I can stand Texas Roadhouse rolls.. just couldn\u2019t eat the rest of the meal! Thankfully only two rounds to go! I may die of the fatigue before then though. Maybe if I had seen the dr in October when I first started being fatigued, it might not be so bad. But that dang 7.2 cm tumor came from nowhere during the busiest time of the year For pharmacists and i got too run down. Good luck all",

I didn\u2019t feel good until today and tomorrow is round 3!! I hate fluphila but it keeps knocking my white count up to 20 so I guess that\u2019s why it hurts so bad. Chickywicky that is awesome news!!!! Also ( I\u2019m knocking on wood!) the b complex and b12 shots have really helped with neuropathy prevention. I already take gabapentin for neuropathy from nerve damage so that may be helping too. Also I hold a cup of ice water all through chemo .. just to keep my finger tips cold. Also I found that taking my probiotic daily and eating ice during chemo has saved my mouth! I hope I\u2019m not jinxing myself for tomorrow!! Good luck! My biggest problem now is I\u2019m really anemic. That just makes the fatigue and breathing so much worse. But my iron, ferritin, b12 and folate were all normal. So the only fix will probably be a blood transfusion but hopefully I can skate by two more rounds! I even choked down chicken livers before we found out iron wasn\u2019t the problem! Yuck! Well good luck everyone ...",

Tuesday had a liter of NS and the Fulphila shot (like Neulsta) and 3:49pm. At 11:49 pm the bone and muscle pain creeped in and I wanted to scream. It lasted days 3-5 and I mean it felt like concrete slabs were dropped on top of me for the elephant parade. Stabbing, jabbing, pulling!!! Not even a glimpse of nausea, a little bit of diarrhea day 3. Day 5 my mouth was completely overtakenwith thrush. I realized I hadn\u2019t taken my mh probiotic in 3 days( too many other pills). I took it last night and This morning it is almost healed. So far today I feel human. Glad I took claritin or I might\u2019ve died! Good luck to all",
