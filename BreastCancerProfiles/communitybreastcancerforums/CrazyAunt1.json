Does anyone have any suggestions as to what I can do while I wait to get an appointment? I have LE in my left breast area and around my side under my arm. It's getting painful under my arm.

There is no infection. It's also hard. My oncologist said it could be lymphedema. Has anyone else had this and what did you do about it? CrazyAunt Log in to post a reply",
