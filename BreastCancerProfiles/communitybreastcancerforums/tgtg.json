Of course, I too hoped I would turn out to be one of the lucky ones whose biopsy turned out negative, but I wasn't! But the diagnosis is not the end of the world, especially when the tumor is small and found early. And being older, as I was too, has its advantages, as things usually move and grow more slowly as we age. So relax as much as you can, live in the present, and if there is a cancer, do what needs to be done to get rid of it. I found that the limbo of not knowing was far harder to deal with than knowing for sure that the tumor would be removed a few weeks later. And as others have said, be careful to avoid unreliable websites that you locate via Google. This is a good source of information, both medical professionals and from other women who have been through what you might be going through. Best wishes to you and your family, TG",

At my breast center/hospital, it is standard procedure that the surgeon (not the radiologist) orders the biopsy and type of biopsy; the nurse navigator at the center actually sets up the appointment with the surgeon for us.) The surgeon reviewed my images and then did a clinical exam to locate the suspicious area manually (he found it); he then ordered the type of biopsy he wanted, an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. The biopsy itself was no big deal, even though it was the first invasive procedure I had ever had till then, and the results were ready 3 days later. The rest is history. So relax, this order of things is not unusual or odd at all. And be glad that they are getting more information about those microcalcs now. If they are benign, your future mammos will be less stressful for you; if they turn out to be cancerous or precancerous (DCIS), they will have been caught early and you will have a much better prognosis than if they had been ignored for another year.

Let me correct something that Lottemarine wrote, too: an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is NOT based on radiation. As its name says, it uses magnetic fields to create images, not x-rays (this is why a wedding ring must be removed). The contrast dye they inject is gadalinium (sp?)--in my case, brand name Gadavist. CAT and PET scans are both based on radiation, but are different from MRI.",

Even with clean nodes, a positive HER2 typically leads to chemotherapy. As for the Oncotype number that others have referred to, that may not be an option for your mother since she is being treated abroad. It isn't available in Australia and Canada (and also, I believe, Japan), so she might not have access to it wherever she is, Your relatives living there would need to find out about its availability there. While a lot of the concern about chemo pertains to immediate side effects (nausea, brain fog, etc.) there are also other factors about chemo that a 65-year-old woman might want to take into consideration, I haven't studied chemo too much since I didn't need it, but I did learn that chemo can damage vital organs, like the heart. For a 65-year-old, this can mean that she will stave off a breast cancer recurrence, but die soon anyway because of cardiac issues created or exacerbated by the chemo! ,I suggest that you do some research on this co-morbidity aspect of chemotherapy, before urging her to go along with the oncologist if she is HER2 negative, and to learn about the co-morbidity effects of the drug being suggested for her if she is HER+. I suggest you have your family members abroad or your mother tell you the name of the drug the oncologist was suggesting (they may have to ask the oncologist if they don't know it) . It is just slightly possible that the oncologist was referring not to chemo but to hormonal therapy after surgery and radiation, and the anti-hormonals are a whole different issue from chemo. Something might have been lost in translation or in the transmission of information to you (oncologists prescribe an supervise both chemo and hormonal therapy). I don't know what kind of health insurance system your mother is part of n her country, but if it is one that allows for a second opinion, seeking advice from another oncologist might be advisable too. Finally, this decision is ultimately your mother's--not yours, not your relatives', not the oncologist's, The oncologist's job is to advisere a patient of his or her best recommend for that patient, but the oncologist cannot force a patient to accept that recommendation, and the family can't either. .Trudi . . .",

While it makes sense to act quickly once you and your doctors know what you are dealing with (which you don't know right now)--it is crucial to have as complete a diagnosis as possible first (which you don't have right now, since the only pathology information you have is skimpy, based on a very limited sample from the needle aspiration). Before rushing headlong into action, do get more information, preferably in consultation with another breast cancer team. Besides, in us older folks, cancers seem to grow fairly slowly (just like everything else that moves slowly in us), so spending a month or so getting fully and adequately informed is likely not going to shorten your mother's life--on the contrary it should produce the best possible treatment plan for her particular stats and tumor presentation, info that you certainly do not have now. As barredowl suggests, unless you live outside the US, you should have been given the paperwork (another red flag about this surgeon, by the way, if you are in the U.S.). Your second opinion doc should shed more light on the various types of biopsies and help you understand what's involved in each. One big advantage of the ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is that the radiologist (or surgeon) attaches a titanium marker on the suspicious mass after taking all the material from it, and that titanium marker then enables the surgeon to locate the tumor during the lumpectomy and help him/her to cut out sufficient tissue around it to get clean (cancer-free) margins all around, which in turn eliminates the need for additional surgery for your mom to get fully clean margins the second time around. And if the mass turns out to be benign, that marker remains in place so that interpreters of future mammograms know that this mass has been evaluated. Lastly, before the surgeon starts the lumpectomy itself, he does an excisional biopsy of the sentinel lymph node (anywhere from 1 to 3 are removed, depending on what the radioactive dye shows) and it undergoes a quick pathology review immediately (the sample later undergoes a full post-surgical path study as well, to be positive that it is clean). So, for example, since the first node (the sentinel one) showed no cancer cells at all in my case, the surgeon left the other two alone--and having only one or 2 removed eliminates a lot of grief later on, by the way.)

I was diagnosed at 71, so I can empathize with her and you, especially about avoiding major surgery if possible. My first reaction to your post, given the details you included, is that you really should get a second opinion, from a team of breast specialists. My second reaction is that I fear that your mother may be a victim of \"ageism\"--i.e., the attitude that \"she's 81, so what we do really won't matter much, so we don't need to do much\"--an attitude that my radiation oncologist told me is, unfortunately, still present among some practitioners when patients are in their 70's and 80's (\"The patient will die soon, anyway, so what we do does't really matter\"). I suggest that you get a second opinion because of the current team's attitudes about biopsy. While I am not a physician, I have read and learned about this disease, and all the literature (plus my own, and others', experiences) have revealed the fact that the ultimate final picture of the tumor is determined by the pathology studies done on the surgically removed tumor and the sentinel lymph node and this pathology report in turn sets the course for future treatment plans. An ultrasound-guided core biopsy (different from a needle aspiration) identifies a host of factors (HR and HER2 status, grade of tumor, type of carcinoma, for example), but the pathology done after surgery adds staging and sometimes identifies different characteristics from the ones in the the core biopsy report as well. Knowing whether your mother's HER2 status is positive or negative before any surgery can determine treatment options too--including pre-surgery treatment for a HER2+ tumor--so, yes, a core biopsy might reveal key information that you don't have now (and it is a simple and non-threatening procedure under local anesthesia). I also suggest a second opinion because of the surgeon's categorical statement that lumpectomy is followed by radiation, which is true in general. BUT in the past few years researchers have shown convincing evidence in the medical journals that ER/PR positive women who are 70 and older do not get much, if any, added benefit from radiation and do just as well as by following a course of anti-hormonal treatment. This research, which comes from such venerable institutions as MD Anderson and Harvard, has been reviewed here on the BCO site--but your guys seem to be unaware of it, and to me that's a red flag about them. Bottom line--I think you need more input from different breast cancer specialists, perhaps at a different facility. You would also be well advised to ask the surgeon who has seen your mother just how many breast cancer surgeries he does in a week, month, year--and how many of those have recurred and what kind of fellowship training he has had in surgery for breast cancer. Good luck to you and your mother on this journey--it is manageable, especially if you continue to ask questions and learn as much as you can. T.",

Like the two of you, I had grown sons and 3 granddaughters at diagnosis, which came 4 days before Christmas, and had a lumpectomy first thing in the new year (but was in active treatment only from early Jan. to early May). Becoming educated about your situation is very helpful, provided you use the right sources--juried sites like BCO and medical journal articles--and not just \"any old thing\" you find on the Web. You want to be an active and informed participant in your treatment planning and implementation. And it can help you evaluate potential members of your medical team, as it did for me, when I dumped the first radiation oncologist I saw, who struck me and my husband as a wet-behind-the-ears schoolboy who \"answered\" my questions by ignoring them and blathering on about something else that I hadn't asked about. I especially want to underscore what MsP suggests about positive thinking--your optimistic attitude is your best ally. Go into this thinking positively and ignore the horror stories that you can find on the Web! Once the shock of my diagnosis wore off, I told myself that my chances for full recovery were really good and I held fast to that idea. Going thru rads with a positive attitude also helps--I told myself that I would not have skin problems and didn't (just followed the rad onc's recommendations for avoiding them), and that I would not experience fatigue and didn't, And 7 weeks really do go by quickly--it's not an eternity! I'll also add that going into this journey in good physical condition also helps. Keep up your fitness regimen (or start one--even just walking briskly every day) before surgery. Your body will be stronger, and you will be able to sleep without help from drugs. I resumed my M-W-F fitness regimen two days after surgery, with the surgeon's blessing, and kept it up all thru rads. Being fit made rads a breeze--it prevented fatigue, even though I went directly from rads to the gym 3 days a week! While this diagnosis is earth-shaking and can upset your center of gravity for a while, it is not the end of the world. Lots of women have survived the diagnosis and the disease and are thriving. I feel as good as before--indeed even better than before most days--ready to take on new adventures and fully enjoy the pleasures of retirement. .Best. TG",

As a bonus, as soon as the surgery was over, I returned to sleeping like a log! Relax.

And being in the care of a woman who is one of our bc \"sisters\" also added a dimension of caring that my other doctors just couldn't provide. I actually had my surgery at Paoli, also in the Main Line Health system and also like Lankenau tied in with Fox Chase CC--but happily opted to take add 15 minutes of driving time to get to Lankenau because of her. And my husband (a retired Penn faculty member) and I both find the atmosphere and staff in MLH hospitals are much more patient-friendly than at UPenn on the whole. Can't speak for chemo services anywhere, though, as I was lucky enough not to need it. Wishing you the best, tgtg",

As for delays, it is wise to include them in your thinking. During 35 rads treatments,I experienced 2 delays--one before I started (the hospital decided to recertify and upgrade its computer system), and the second near the end, when the safety door to the linear accelerator room would not lock, requiring an expert to be flown in to correct the problem.",

He also said that he would take enough tissue surrounding the tumor to give me clean, wide margins, which my surgical pathology report said he had done. And as he promised, the surgery time was short: they wheeled me into the OR at 11:15 and he dictated his report at 12:01, 46 minutes later (that includes his scrub time and my prepping time). No need for re-excision, no more surgery, finished, done! So if you are as fearful of surgery as you say, the shorter, simpler and effective procedure would seem to be the way to go, especially since as we age, the less anesthesia we get, the better off we are. Traditional external radiation was no big deal either--at 71, I had no adverse reactions at all, not even fatigue (but I work out at the gym regularly and walk every day, including during rads). Radiation did cause me to rearrange my schedule a bit, but only on weekdays for 7 weeks--that translates to 35 days out of one year, or less than 10% of a year, no big deal. I tell you all this because not all lumpectomies lead to re-excisions or the need for mastectomy (which, as others have pointed out, is not a silver bullet that aways totally eliminates the need for radiation). In fact, of all the women I know in my area who have had lumpectomies, only one needed a re-excision for one margin (and her tumor presented unusually, as it was tethered to her skin and the surgeon couldn't use a wire to guide him). If you do seek a second opinion, do be sure to ask the surgeon how many lumpectomies he/she does each year, because experience is very important (more important than whether you like or dislike his/her recommended action). And if you don't know how many the first surgeon you saw does a year, give him/her a call and ask! Good luck in the days ahead, and don't feel pressured into immediate action!",
