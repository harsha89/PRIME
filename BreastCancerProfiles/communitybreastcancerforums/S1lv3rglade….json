Unfortunately, it didn't work for me (I got the 404 error message) so I googled the topic under Huffpost and found the following article.: The information here seems to directly contract the facts presented by Cancer Research UK, who claim there's no such thing as a 'superfood' (I.e. Broccoli etc won't stop you from getting cancer) and also that there's no proof that sugar feeds cancer - these are theories hyped up by the press. See link here: (10 cancer myths debunked) Ultimately, I guess it depends who you have more trust & faith in and personally, I trust Cancer Research UK over the Huffington Post - perhaps partly because I'm British I tried submitting the above with the two links but the system informed me that I'm not allowed to submit links at this time",
