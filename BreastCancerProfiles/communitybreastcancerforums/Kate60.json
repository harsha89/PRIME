She is very matter of fact and if I ask her something which she has already told me she will say 'remember I told you....' anyway, she did mention something about someone having to give me a shot the next day and I'm wondering if it is the neulast shots she was referring too. If so, what is it for? It must be after treatment 2 though because I don't have anything at all at the moment.

Yep, I succumbed to a wonderful infection in both breasts post operatively, so I have spent the last 5 days being hooked up to an IV every 6 hours for an infusion of good old antibiotics. Luckily I live near the hospital and they gave me leave passes to come home between treatments during the day, as long as I was back by 6.00pm to stay overnight. I have to say I never stayed out later than 4.00pm because I was whacked by then. They said it was very strange to get identical infections in both breasts. Mine were even steven the whole way. It looked like I had been in a really hot bath, as they were bright pink, to a certain point and then normal colour. Then it turned into cellulitis of the breast tissue. Charming! OMG did my skin hurt. It was just so sensitive that even having the lightest cotton material resting on them hurt. Luckily the infection never got into my system, so I was never ill. They are gradually getting better, but it is very slowly. I have finally received my hormone status and I am triple positive. As far as I understand it, I now have to meet with a medical oncologist to decide if I should take Herceptin with chemo. This is not something that had ever been on the cards before, so it is a real shock to the system. I was told surgery and radiation and that would be that. I need your thoughts please.  If you were me... (and some of your are).... would you throw the book at it and take chemo + herceptin for something that the surgeon was certain was totally removed in surgery (and no lymph node involvement), but the drugs will possibly cause bad side effects and illness,  or, given that it is supposedly all gone, not take preventative and drastic measures, and just have radiation as planned and keep a close eye on things? To be honest, I am S*** scared really for the very first time since the C word was mentioned.",

I'm not sure where to post my reply, so it's on my own link but I hope you see it (I am getting a little lost with so many links here).  I have a query. I have my pathology report but it doens't say anything about the ER/PR or HER status at all. Would this have been done at the biopsy or is it found out after surgery? My report does say basically that it is Malignant and started off as DCIS but has infiltrated into the periductal fat. There are comedo  'nests' and plemorphic large cells and Mitotic activity is brisk.  All of which is just plain old goobledegook to me, but it doesn't sound particulary good I feel. Does anyone know what the heck this all means? Still can't believe I have this - and I guess I'm not alone there. I feel just fine so how can I be sick? I really don't think I'm in denial, I just can't relate to it at all, so I'm just being very pragmatic about it at this stage. Bye for now, Kate ",

I'm either doing too much research and getting overloaded (probably) or I just don't have the knowledge (yet) to understand what I am reading. As I don't have my final results yet and I am having my lumpectomy and SNB done next Friday, what should I be hopeing for? I know no lymph node involvement means it hasn't spread and  clean margins is the gold star to aim for, but what I'm really confused about and need to know is apart from that, what other things are the best indicators that show that I have a good fighting chance.Not that I won't fight regardless, but I read somewhere that being HER+ is a good thing, but elsewhere that it means it is more aggresive. Confused too about the hormones ER/PR. I am menapausal now so is it less common to have hormone receptor cancer if you are in menapause? I think the not knowing is just the worst. I'm sure I'll deal with whatever hand I'm dealt with but at the moment my imagination is in overdrive. I know I'm far from being alone with these feelings.",

The reason I couldn't shower on Friday before the surgery was because the BS had done all the mark up lines and they went from my throat almost down to my belly button. Unfortunately even though he'd used a permanent marker, lots of the lines rubbed off during the night, so he re-drew them on Friday. Today (Weds) I have just had my first shower and washed my hair.  So basically I didn't do any special washing at all. I found that strange, because my mother in law went in to have a cancerous mole removed from her leg and she had to thoroughly wash everything - even her hair - with this medicated solution on the morning of her op. Well I can tell you, that now being day 5 post surgery, so far I haven't got any signs of infection or anything bad happening. I think they give you a pretty big wash down of the chest area in theatre, and you're right. It's not like they are cutting your head open, and yes you do get to wear a very pretty (not) paper cap.",

      "Content": "Dec 23, 2011 05:38AM - edited Dec 23, 2011 05:47AM by Kate60 Hi Maureen. BIGWelcome to you! I have to admit, I know next to zero about radiation. Someone told me (and I now can't think who it was, there have been so many people I've had appointments with)  that each treatment is the equivalent of running a 20mile marathon. Now I have to tell you, I'd be absolutely buggered just doing one marathon, let alone 30 of them. Hence the fatigue, cause it takes a long time for the body to regenerate and fix the cells that get damaged. The healthy (non cancerous) ones do fix themselves, the bad ones kick the bucket.  I have to say that I am so relieved that I don't have to do chemo. Heck I've spent far too much money to lose my luscious locks!!  Great to have you here. I haven't got a fixed date for my first radiation but they said it would be mid January. I had a lumpectomy and snb (all clear) and because I had very large breasts I got a reduction. That has been the silver lining to all of this. Should I be using a moisuriser now? I have heard you can suffer burns/blisters etc, ye-ouch.... Any tips greatfully received. Cheers for now, Kate  ",

Well it seems like the radiation is the last hurdle for you to jump over.... and it's lovely that you are here so we can all support each other. I too will be doing 6 weeks x 5 days of radiation next month. Hey I love your blog. Heck I actually learnt quite a bit about all the medical terminology.  I still don't have all the full facts about my cancer. I am hopeing to get the hormone status in the new year. My cancer was grade 3, a nasty little bugger, but absolutley teeny. I must have just got it in it's infancy. I didn't have any cancer in my sentinal node and as I had a breast reduction at the same time (I had humungous breasts, and apparently they don't handle radiation very well) they took out very wide margins and all was clear. This cancer has given me a lot to think about. I have never had much faith, and what little I did, was blown away with the events of September 11. But....... something or someone conspired to have me working in a hospital, where I was asked to hand out flyers for breast awareness month, and I pretty much rang on the spot figuring I was over 50 and the flyers were targeted at me!. I have to say, I am loathe about looking after myself and doing all the check ups etc you're supposed to do when you reach a certain age. I did have a pap smear last year, but that was only after my doctor made me give him my word that I would because it had been 11 years since my last one. So for me to ring up and make an appointment for a mammogram, without procrastinating and carrying on - on the spot, got the wheels in motion to catch this cancer in it's infancy.  To find out that it was small but aggressive, but was \"caught in time\" has really made me question a lot. Another thing too. My mother passed away over 4 years ago. No matter how much I wanted to really 'feel' her presence, I never did. That is until now..... Is it her doing this? is it God? So many questions for sure, but one thing I know, it has really made me question an awful lot. Anyway, enough about me. Welcome again and it's good to have you share you experiences here with us. Cheers Kate",

My breast surgeon doesn't want to see me until November next year? I forgot to ask if my right breats (the good one) had been checked when they did the reduction. Do you think they would have checked it too for cancer? I feel such a duffus.. You and I have a very similar diagnosis. I did ask him though that if I was HER+ would I do Herceptin. He thought that would be overkill and honestly I am relieved by his response. I had sort of weighed up all the pro's and con's of taking that drug, and for me, I think it would have had more of a detrimental effect on me than the cancer was worth. I've always been very healthy. Strong as an ox, but to be honest I don't deserve to be this healthy. I have not treated this body as a temple, and I greatly fear that any drug that comprises my immunity will make it all come crashing down. Luckily, I am not faced with that now. I hear you about the coincidence factor.  ...... ummmm, more navel gazing from me. Cherrio for now Kate ",

Yep, I'm a bit uncertain about rads too, but from what I can gather, the effects of chemo are much worse, so if you got through that OK hopefully radiation shouldn't be nearly as bad. Yes the fatigue side effect is going to be the kicker I think. But it might only last a couple of weeks. Lets hope anyway.  As you are young and active, probably your heart and lungs will be just fine. I had a lovely Christmas, but I have to say, I'm pleased it is all over for another year.... onto better things next year for all of us. Cheers Kate",

Very hopeful for us ladies about to embark on the treatment. MAUREEN - I think you are very brave to have said No to chemo - before I got my SNB results back in, I was thinking what I would do if I needed Chemo and like you, I was weighing up all th pro's and con's. I figured that I didn't want my immune system compromised unless it was going to be a life saving step -not just a precautionary one. Luckily for me, I got the all clear and my BS is absolutly certain he got al the cancer out so I don't need it. Radiation doesn't phase me much. I figure what's a bit of skin burn and fatigue if its effective and hunts down and kills any other cancer cells lurking about?  Well it sure is going to be interesting having the treatment. Glad you're here with me.  Cheers,Kate",

I've been in hospital for the past 5 days with a post operative infection to both breasts and today I went and saw my RO for the initial pre radiation consult.  I have been thrown a curve ball and so I may not be starting radiation this month as planned. It seems they have at last found out that I am triple positive, which includes HER2. So I now have to meet with a medical oncologist to discuss the posibility of Herceptin and Chemo. This was never something I was planning on and was never discussed as a possibility, so it's all gone a bit belly-up for me. So I may not join you all here in January, but I will pop in from time to time to see how you are all doing. Boy, by the time I get to have rads (which now mightn't be until the end of the year!) You'll be all done and dusted and all in a strong recovery with NED hopefully. Cheers Kate",
