Did anyone have similar results as me? Do you think my lump is leaning more on the benign or malignant side? An input is greatly appreciated. Thank you! Here are what the results say: There is a lobulated hypoechoic solid mass. This mass does show internal vascular flow. The mass measures 2.4 x 1.2 x 1.9 cm. It does show some internal echogenic foci. There is dense shadowing. There is through transmission. Margins are slightly indistinct. BI-RAD category 4 suspicious abnormality.   Log in to post a reply",
