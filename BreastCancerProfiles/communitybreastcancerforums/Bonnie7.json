You may find that it is exactly what you say, a swollen lymph node from your body fighting an infection. Painful lymph nodes is a sign that yr immune system is doing it's job again it could be the aftermath of the infection. I can appreciate this is very worrying but try not to get ahead of yourself (we all do that sometimes, myself included!) perhaps another member can reassure you, regardless of that keep us posted and remember we are all here for you. You are not still breast feeding? Just a thought.... Wishing you and yr family a Merry, Merry Christmas! üéÖüèºüíõ      ",

I had rads 16 yrs ago, skin held up through out and blistered on the second last day, but had a reconstruction 2014 (lat dorsi) followed by a reoccurence (not certain these were related!) chemo over and now expecting to start rads in March - worried re same as I am pretty small, all ribs and bones with implant out and wonder how my skin will hold out this time! Sounds like you need a break, you don't go back out in the sun if you are sun burned and in Scotland they say \"if in doubt, do nought\". Good luck xx ",

It comes and goes, I did see numerous Doctors but honestly started to feel like a hypochondriac as they had no answers, pretty sure hormones play a part! I too will try the soda water, sorry I can't be more helpful! X",
