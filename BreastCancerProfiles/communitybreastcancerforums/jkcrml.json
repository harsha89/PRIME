I will have the port put in on the 11th of March and start chemo on the 12th. I'm doing chemo 18 weeks every 3 weeks and on the herceptin for a year. I teach 2nd grade and am hoping to continue teaching during the chemo.I haven't gone shopping for a wig but did buy some turbans! Denali, what is a Neulasta shot and what is it for?",

I went every month for a year and then 3 years ago my mom (she is 101 and going strong!) moved in with us, she is hard of hearing and didn't enjoy the group so I stopped but am going to start going again. Thanks for the information. Are you still feeling ok from the chemo? Did you eat before you went or during? We went out and looked for hats today- it was a lot of fun- there are some great Greta Garbo styles out there!",

Mine also itched so I'm back on steroids to see if that will help. He also said it can go on like this for a year! Don't know if this helps you but it's nice to know you have company! Karen",
