      "Content": "Corac wrote: I went to the Dr last Tuesday as I was having severe pain in left breast. Dr sent me for ultrasound the next day. When the radiologist came in I knew something was wrong he examined me and kept asking if my pain was on the opposite side of my breast as he had found a nodule that he said should not be there. I have breast implants so he explained to me the risk of my implant be popped during a core needle biopsy and said the risk was much greater not doing it. by Friday morning I had the biopsy and am waiting for the results. My question is there anyone who has had severe pain in their breast and been diagnosed with having breast cancer on the opposite side? I feel like I'm dreaming as all of this is happening so quickly I am 33 years old and have three childeren and can't believe that this happens at my age I guess I am a little naive. My pain is constant and feels like a knife but also burns... Log in to post a reply",

When I asked the radiologist if this was negative if they would remove the lump he said \"If\" it turns out benign and I can't stop thinking about the way he said well \"if\". My lump is 11mm is that considered small or big?",
