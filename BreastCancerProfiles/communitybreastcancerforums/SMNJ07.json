For an update, I getting the results mailed to me and I did get the assistant on the phone again and I explained to her that I've never had a result described to me like that before, so I didn't know if there were extra cells or abnormal cells found, etc.  The last time I was just told that I had fibrocystic breasts and nothing was found.  She said that all it meant was that the sample was made up of ductal cells and not lobular cells and some bloody cells.  The cells from the sample were benign.  She read the results directly from the report and in a way, I think that I would rather have that type of description and not a general \"everything came back normal...\"  I'd rather know exactly what it is that was tested, how and why.  I guess the best advice is to make sure that you truly understand what the results are saying and if you have questions don't be afraid to ask and get a copy of the pathology report ",
