      "Content": "surfette wrote: I had a lumpectomy 3 weeks ago tomorrow. I like my surgeon, he did a great job (I think), he cut around the areola and didn't even leave a scar. He is highly reputed in the community. However his office staff is horrendous!! Chaotic, uncaring, disorganized, etc. At my follow up appointment he gave me the name of an oncologist to go see to determine if I am having chemotherapy before my radiation. He purportedly had all my records sent to her but just to be sure, I got copies and sent them myself. I go to the oncologist yesterday and she says \"Where is your oncotyping report?\" I asked, isn't it in that stack? No, it's not. Well it turnes out, the oncotyping was never ordered by the surgeon or his staff. His office's position is that this is something the oncologist does after your appointment. I asked his office manager what is the point of waiting 3 weeks after my surgery to have the oncologist order the oncotyping when it takes another 3 weeks to get the test results back? She tells me it's because the oncologiest needs to determine if you are a candidate for the oncotype test. That to me seems like a load of BS. I can't imagine that this is a valid reason to wait 3 weeks while my cancer could be metasticizing. I can't start my radiation until this chemotherapy decision is made. So I called the oncologist's office and asked who normally does this? They told me unequivocally that the surgeon orders this at the point of surgery. So now I feel like I have wasted 3 weeks for nothing and the surgeon's office is trying to cover their tracks because they should have ordered the test and they never did, and now they are trying to foist the responsibility on the oncologist. But I could be wrong. So I am asking, if you know, is this correct? You wait to order the oncotyping til several weeks after surgery? Or it's done at the same time?

What upsets me is that my breast surgeon had the final pathology report showing my tumor is ER+/PR +, HER -, and node negative back on October 11, so I don't see why he didn't order it then instead of me having to wait to see the oncologist and have her order it. That is a lot of time wasted and I am concerned about recurrence and/or not zapping all the cancer before it spreads.",

      "Content": "surfette wrote: I had my lumpectomy and node biopsy last Wednesday, the 29th. They discharged me with the instructions \"wear surgical bra\". My post-op is not til Oct 12 and my doctor is away til then. I wore the bra for 2 days and then hand washed it and it promptly shrunk. I tried to squeeze into it, it was very uncomfortable and the velcro is making me itch like crazy. I've tried sports bras but they are no goodas they rub against the incision. The only thing I can handle is a bikini top, but I can't wear that at work because it invites all kinds of questions when they see the tie strings: \"Going to the beach after work today????\" The point is, do I really need to wear anything at all? I have VERY small boobs, like BARELY a B cup. There is not a lot of jiggling around. I would be soooo much more comfortable if I could just let it all hang loose with a baggy top. How long do I really need to wear this contraption? And most importantly, do I really need to wear it when I sleep? I'm going on nine days now since surgery.

And then he refers you out to a radiation and chemo person, and sometimes the records don't get sent, and its a huge hassle. So I want to get everything consolidated.",

I've been on tamoxifen since January 2011 and stopped my periods a few months later. I'm 50 now. I go for regular pelvic ultrasounds and they always show cysts that come and go. My latest one has two 3 cm cysts in one ovary. My gynecologist has strongly suggested I consider getting these ovaries removed prophylactically. Of course I am concerned about ovarian cancer or a recurrence of the breast cancer, but I heard oophorectomy can lead to cardiac problems? I'm not sure what to do. I'm BRCA negative. My mother's aunt on one side of the family had breast cancer as well as her cousin on the other side of the family. So my family/genetic risk is not great however I do keep getting these cysts. If getting the oophorectomy would reduce my risk of cancer I'd do it in a minute but I'm concerned about the downside.
