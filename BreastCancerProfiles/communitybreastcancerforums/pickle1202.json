My husband was so excited, but I am afraid the onc will bust our bubble next week when we go.  I cautioned him against getting so excited, but he is so afraid of my getting even more sick.  I have allergic reactions to everything, and the chemo scares him.  Anyone have any thoughts on what I should expect.  I know each person, each case, and each treatment is different, but any info helps.  thanks Donna",
