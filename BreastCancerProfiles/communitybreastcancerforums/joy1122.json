It's a different scar but it was a shock to see my faceless boob. It was ayear ago 7/24. It's a personal choice but my husband did come in with me. I figured he would see it sooner or later. I wanted to get it over with. He was wonderful about it. We have four boys,my oldest is in the air force. During my surgery he was in Kuwait. My youngestÂ  had open heart surgery and chest wall surgery during my chemo months. Talk about stressfull! He really was angry with God for a long time. We are both slowly coming back. Hang in there. It's a long jurney with alot of ups and downs. Come here often. We are all here for you and we understand. Take Care, Joyce",
