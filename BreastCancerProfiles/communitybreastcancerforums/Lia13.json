It's not the same kind of bandage I would use to wrap the arm for the night (I asked). Since we've just started, he said he prefers to start easy, have the bandages moderately tight (which is subjective I guess) and put on top of them my sleeve for additional pressure and see how the arm reacts. (yeah, the sleeve won't last long...) To me it makes sense, but as I've said before, my experience and understanding of how these things work are limited.  Judging by the result, his overall approach  seems to be working, it's not painful/uncomfortable and afterwards my arm feels normal, which is what I'm aiming for. Now I need to keep track of the changes, as the goal is to keep the arm in good condition for more than 24 hours. As for the salt; the analogy is 1 tablespoon for every bandage soaked, in enough water to barely cover the bandages, but one can adjust the salt depending on how the skin reacts (if dehydrated too much afterwards or not; I put cream afterwards and it's fine). off to rest now! :-)",

So I need to have an ultrasound in the next few days and then meet with said angiologist and a PT to see if there is any truth in that. Also, I was told that could be a reason why when I use the sleeve the armpit/trunk area feels worse afterwards. I shouldn't use the sleeve till we get the u/s next week. She also prescribed magnesium to relax the shoulder muscle (she found it really tense, does that mean it's fibrotic???) and Lymphomyosot (German biomedicine?). I had never heard of that last one before, but she said as long as my thyroid works ok I can take it and it seems to be very helpful in LE. Does anyone have any experience with it? Here is a link, sorry it's in spanish, but you can see the pic: http://www.heel.cl/medicamentos/lymphomyosot.html I've been doing the lebed intro faithfully every morning for the last few days and do gentle stretching and some yoga, things look stable for now :-)",

It took me more than a year to make peace with the fact that my lymph nodes were removed (long story...), but now I'm really looking forward to taking care of my arm in the best way possible. I still have limited ROM 13 months out of surgery, but lately it's getting better by the day, which is just amazing.  I didn't have LE, until I moved with my husband to another country/continent 5 months ago. My physiotherapist back home partly blames the altitude difference in my new home, but in any case the fact is that my arm got swollen, albeit only a bit, and it doesn't go away. I wake up with very slightly swollen fingers and armpit and part of the operated breast as well. I never got information about LE either before or after the surgery, other than vague warnings about infections and blood pressure and I was never measured. Now that I got over my shock and grief over the surgery (for the most part), I really want to start exercising, but I'm afraid I might do something to make it worse and I need guidance from a professional, at least at the beginning.  I shared my concerns with my new onc, who kind of blew me off and insisted I don't need to see a specialist because my case is not substantial. My current physiotherapist for ROM wasn't very helpful either.  I cannot diagnose myself and I don't know if this swelling is only due to the altitude or if indeed is LE. Everybody seems to think I'm overreacting. After I persisted at the onc's office, he gave me a number to call in a rehab center to ask for more information. I don't think he considered my worries legit enough to give me an actual reference. Thanks to this thread I know now of the Lebed method and I'm ordering it tonight, along with a couple of other DVDs about yoga after breast cancer that I found on Amazon. I'm starting to have hope that there are ways I can help my body. Do you think it would be safe to join a soft yoga class or chi kung/tai chi, even without a specialist monitoring me? Am I really overreacting? I thought I was following the latest guidelines on LE, but maybe I'm over thinking it...! Thanks so much for letting me share and sorry if I got a bit carried away.... :-) I'd love to hear your thoughts.",

I thought I had found my gal, so to speak, but after reading all the comments/articles about MLD not hurting, I'll research a bit more and see how it goes. Also got a prescription for a sleeve and the therapist told me in a lower voice it's the colour of the skin (so I didn't worry or be embarrassed I guess) - well, I'm treating myself to a lymphediva gorgeous set, I need more umph in my life...!  Keep warm :-)",

He dissolved salt in water, put it in the fridge and later bandaged my arm for 20 min with the bandages soaked in that water (after MLD). He said something about salt/potassium balance in the cells (?) and how this helps cells actually liberate salt and retained fluids. Also, the low temperature helps not only LE, but also improves the condition of the skin and appearance. Don't know how it will work out, but at least today my arm felt really good after he took the bandages off.... let's see what happens.

I cannot really say anything on the lebed (I haven't even received the dvd yet), but it could be that not all exercise works the same for everybody and lebed is by no means THE tool for LE, but, the way I see it, just that, a tool that appears to be working for some. There are other options, and it's very likely your body may need a different kind of exercise or sequence or speed. Maybe someone here with more experience will have more ideas and advice on this? I think if it makes you feel good enough to continue, it may not have been lebed alone, or your body would alert you (pain, burning sensation, unpleasant feeling, higher temp etc), but as proudtospin says, less might be the trick. How about housework? Could it be that your arms got tired from both exercise AND housework or something else? Just thinking out-loud here, as this happens to me constantly, so much so that if I, say, mop/fold bedsheets etc or even light crochet, I now know I shouldn't exercise. Cudos for being more comfortable talking about LE, and it only goes to show that it is possible to eventually feel better about things. Thank you for sharing that. :-) As for the (now infamous) exercise ball, it's a thing they use for pilates and, yes, it does look scary. I know my movement therapist doesn't know much about LE and, bless her heart, she is trying hard to help me get more confidence in my body. I'll try it, with the help of my husband and I'll have him take a picture if I fall off! :-) :-) :-) hugz4u, nice to hear you're doing well :-) carol57, I'm impressed with your walking! musical, I'll sure be careful. Who 'd have thought using an exercise ball would be like living on the wild side???? :-) I feel like Indiana Jones embarking  on a mission! :-) :-)  proudtospin, how much weight did your trainer start you with? for now my movement therapist has told me to use 1/2 lt water bottles, 3-5 repetitions, a few times throughout the day.

Wearing the sleeve for a bit after the pool I think saved me, cause now it feels ok, meaning it didn't get worse (that's my new definition of ok!). It's incredible how water can trick you, as everything is much easier to do, but I'll be more careful next time :-) The instructor at the pool had of course no idea what LE even is, but she promised to look it up and help me with more specialized exercises, so at least we'll be working together on this. I've found some aqua lymphatic exercises instructions and will share that with her too. Carol, is your knee any better?

      "Content": "Lia13 wrote: Following a discussion on the kicking LE' s butt thread, I'm posting here my experience with wet wrapping. I have mild LE; minor swelling in my hand, arm, armpit, back of armpit and part of treated breast, with a cushion-like feeling under the armpit, heaviness etc. My current massage therapist is admittedly NOT following the standard LE care protocol and for the last part of our session he wraps my arm with elastic bandages soaked in cold salted water.  He dissolves salt into water (abt 1 tablespoon for each bandage), puts in the bandages and puts everything in the fridge before we start the session. Abt 40 min later, he wraps my arm moderately tight and on top we put my sleeve (that's optional, alternatively we could wrap a bit tighter, but the sleeve adds the right compression for me) and leave it for 20min-no more no less. I asked him for more research/articles etc and I'm hoping he'll provide something, but in the meantime the result has been great, even though I cannot know if it's because it's part of his strange treatment plan or if it has any value in itself.  His explanation was that when cells retain fluid, there is an imbalance in their potassium/salt ratio and there is salt trapped inside that can't get out. By providing external salt, it interacts with the potassium and triggers the cell to release the internal salt, releasing fluid as well (it's not the same like when salt is digested). The optimal time is 20 min, and this time limit also helps protect the blood circulation in case it's necessary to wrap tighter (depending on the case). The elastic bandage works better than other garments, because due to texture/compression it releases the salt gradually, thus making the process smoother. Afterwards the skin is dehydrated, which requires moisturizer-he said the water/salt ratio depends on the reaction of the skin too and it may take a few tries till one gets it right. I would guess this might work even better for general edema, but it seems to be working for my LE too. I'm having 2 sessions per week and we'll re-evaluate in 4 weeks.  So far I've had ayurvedic massage abyanga (4 sessions over 4 weeks) and standard MLD followed by 25 min on the compression pump (2 sessions over 2 weeks), which didn't work for me (perhaps I should've tried more frequent sessions). The pump was great, but results didn't last long. With my current treatment the results are not as good as the pump, but they last a lot longer and I'm very excited about it. My arm is clearly a lot happier. My therapist said he is using a combination of lymphatic massage, along with anthroposophical elements and the word Tibet came up once or twice. I know it's not the norm and since I don't have any medical background whatsoever I cannot really tell if it makes sense or not, but I'll give it a try and report back in case somebody is interested.

I'm also drinking LOTS of water (I used to barely drink one glass and now I can go up to 1,8-2 ltrs daily) and the wet bandage thing comes in the end of the treatment, which I hope gives the chance to protein to go on its way and not get stuck behind. Sorry if this sounds too simplistic, it's the only way I can understand it at the moment :-) I've also been encouraged to up my dietary vit C intake, especially with small quantities of cranberries and the therapist uses a natural orange massage oil (for vit C) for part of the massage. I'm continuing with hydration, skin-care and my exercise routine wearing the sleeve, all of which also definitely contribute to my overall well-being.

She told me the clinical edema that does exist is not from LE, but edema (I was also evaluated by the PT she works with and they both suspect muscular issues may be the cause of limited motion/inflammation/edema). I don't know whether they didn't want to charge me for an extra doppler or whether the doppler is not officially used in that context, but the doc gave me that opinion unofficially (without images and/or a diagnosis on paper). I tried to find out some info on line about doppler and LE diagnosis, but there is so little. It is mentioned as a diagnostic test when other reasons of edema are suspected or need to be addressed, but nowhere did I find that it can rule out LE and I sure don't understand how it works. Would anyone have an idea where I could look for more info on this? It's difficult for me to ask medical questions in Spanish and understand the answers, but if I have a general idea of what's going on I'll be able to ask the angiologist for more explanation, if I need any, next time I see her.  At this point, this (a LE misdiagnosis of all things!!!) was so unexpected that I don't know whether to believe it or not... I've been let down by docs before and I'm a bit skeptical...

Is there any link you could provide?  vlnrph, a few months back I was diagnosed with mild LE (arm measurements are slightly different and have been stable) by a physical therapist supposedly specialized in LE, but I wasn't happy with the care I received and didn't go back. The (albeit slight) swelling is clinically evident. My onc refused to give me a referral, the PT who first diagnosed me wasn't of much help, I can't find a national data base (I live in Chile) with certified specialists, language/culture barriers can sometimes be a problem, so I feel I'm pretty much on my own... Which is ok, except that I cannot diagnose myself. For the angiologist to change my first diagnosis from mild LE to non-lymph related edema possibly due to muscular issues, she must be pretty convinced or she wouldn't put me in danger of further LE damage, right?. But are there any similar experiences/data re Doppler to support her conviction or is it a very subjective opinion? She didn't explain anything else about the findings of the Doppler (other than \"everything is ok\"), so I decided to call her office and ask for another appointment, but in the meantime I'm also trying to understand as much as I can, to ask her the right questions. :-) ",

I asked the therapist, supposedly an expert in LE, and she told me the first session is always the worst, because the tissue is still hard. The operated side of the breast is still tender and a bit swollen, as well as the armpit and under it and other points on my arm . I even asked her if I should put something before next session, like an anesthetic cream or something, but she promised it wouldn't be that bad from now on. She told me to drink as much water as I can throughout the day to help the tissue return to normal faster. I only have minor swelling so far, which subtly started after an accident 3 months out of surgery (same side as lumpectomy, result was ruptured tendon-OUCH!-talking about things that make LE worse...), but seems to have settled for good the last few months. She  was the first health care professional I've seen in the past 14 months since surgery that acknowledged that 13 dissected nodes is not a small number and the persistent swelling could be LE and I should try to control it now rather than later. She measured my arms in 8 points and had me put my arms in 3 different positions to observe them. After the MLD she put me on a pressure machine, putting BOTH my arms in huge gloves-like things, up to the shoulder. That was great and after 25 minutes (I napped through it) I could really tell the difference. Why don't you give it a try? IMO you did well to change therapists, since the first one kind of sucked and keep looking till you find someone you makes you feel good and confident (as you noticed, it's the first time I met with a professional so many months out!). I think we should try and do whatever makes us feel better, while trying to control LE and learning to live with it (and hoping to eventually live without it). You have all my respect for going through a double mastectomy, please don't be discouraged, it will get better.",

I find it so annoying (for lack of more appropriate word) when on top of everything else we cannot enjoy a good night's sleep...  Kira, thanks for all the info! I will look more into it (MLD) and the different methods, as my MLD was a bit painful too and I'm really tempted to take up my husband's offer, that he himself learns MLD. If only....  Musical, I hope you find a beige one... pardon my curiosity, is it the colour that gives you a rash or the type of garment? I have a question ladies, about MLD. Would it not be more effective if performed on the whole body and not just the affected arm/area? Isn't the lymph system a System and not just separated parts? Does anyone have any thoughts on this, in case you've heard or read something? I'd like to take it up with my therapist next time...  Also, about docs and risks, as Kira mentions some of us may be more vulnerable for a number of reasons. I recall having swollen hands and ankles before bc, which could or couldn't be related to the lymphatic system, but was never taken in as a factor when discussing risks. Fun things I've heard in the past year from my oncs (just to make you smile, not complaining): I'm too thin to develop LE; they didn't take out so many nodes so my risk is really low; if my arm gets swollen we will see it then; I should see real cases of LE before complaining; my swelling is minor and I shouldn't think about it; it's only a little and it doesn't show; I wouldn't suggest a compression garment because it's really uncomfortable in the summer; you didn't have rads (I refused, a personal decision) so you won't get LE; there is no reason to see a specialist YET (my favorite). So, if I may add something to Coffee's \"things that made my LE worse\" would be me taking advice in the past from non-experts and that includes oncs AND some PTs. Not any more... Coffee, sorry for the long post and I do hope I didn't totally hijack your thread! LE discussion still seems to make me emotional at times. Thanks so much for letting me share here.",

LE is just not in their field and they don't receive much education on it, as it turns out. I feel they may be extremely caring people that just cannot handle the idea that the treatments they offer can have certain kinds of effects, so they kind of ignore it instead of feeling helpless-much like a defense mechanism. Could (probably) be wrong, but this thought has helped me cope with the fact that the medical system, as myself came to know it, felt lacking in so many unexpected ways. I really hope from the bottom of my heart that an LE specialist referral becomes a standard in the treatment/management plan of bc, just like oncs and surgeons and psychologists are. I'm positive we'll see that happening sooner than later, it cannot be ignored for much longer.  Kira, thanks for the additional information. :-) When I see my therapist next time she said she will teach me how to massage my arm and I'll ask her to incorporate more of these sequences both in her practice and mine.

I have some good days and then some bad ones, and it means the world to know that it's ok to have both and to be able to share. Musical, interesting thing about the colour black, no? after my diagnosis and while cleaning out my closets (as a part of getting rid of the old, in with the new), I just couldn't stand myself in the mirror in my black clothes. They felt... heavy. Go figure! So I just gave everything away and haven't been able to even try on something black ever since.
