You basically lie on your stomach and only the breast gets the rads.They say the prone position reduces the chances or rads going near the heart. Radiation onco told me there is VERY little chance of heart damage. I hope he is right, who knows.I also hope that every year the medical field of radiation oncology improves and keeps us living BC free. Did you have rads in the prone position? Wish you the best!",
