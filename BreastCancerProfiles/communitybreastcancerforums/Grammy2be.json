My density is classified as moderate. At my 6 month recheck on 8/31 I had a 3D mammo a spot check and a ultrasound done. The tech showed the radiologist the US and he said it was another cyst, like always...but then an hour after I got home my Dr. called and said I neeeded to schedule a biopsy. I can't see the report as the portal is down for the holiday weekend. I couldn't get scheduled either due to some confusion with the order but hopefully tomorrow I will know more. I too am weary of this almost everytime I have a mammo and am going to ask for a referral to a specialist. Hope we both get good news!!",
