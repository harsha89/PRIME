It manifested itself with redness, warmth, and a slight fever.   I had to have the TE removed and waited 7 months for healing for a replacement.  The Alloderm was infected and had to be removed as well.  We have no idea if the Alloderm was a cause for the infection or if it just became infected along with my skin and TE. I had a second infection scare at replacement time, but this time the heavy duty antibiotics cleared it. We used IV antibiotics for 6 weeks plus an oral one.    We are not sure there was really any infection that time, but no one was taking any chances. I had my exchange and nipple surgery in January and all is going well. There is light at the end of the tunnel! Do you have the redness and imflammation on both sides or just one?  Most people who have an \"infection\" seem to have it on one side.  If it is both, I might suspect some sort of imflammatory reaction. There are a couple of threads under the Breast Reconstruction Forum (Look for Infection in the thread titles) that are discussing this topic also.  Unfortunately this is more common than we would like.  Best of luck to you!",

The first time he assured me everythig was fine.  The second time, I had redness at the incision site and he gave me a course of antibiotices.  Both times the swelling/redness cleared up the next week.  Has anyone else experienced anthing like this with chemo and reconstruction?

      "Content": "Nov 7, 2008 07:04PM - edited Nov 7, 2008 07:06PM by samiam I chose a bilateral mastectomy for multiple reasons. I know we're all different but in my case, it was the \"right thing\". Like encoremom,  I wanted to minimize the risk of recurrance.  Other random reasons included:  1.) I wanted to avoid radiation 2.) I chose expander/implant reconstruction. If I had had radiation and required a mastectomy at a later time, the reconstruction would have been difficult on the radiated breast.  3.) I never wanted to have another mammogram!  4.) My BS told me that with a lumpectomy, he'd go back in once for a clean margin if necessary; but would do a mastectomy if a clean margin was not obtained on round 2.  I didn't want to start with a lumpectomy only to end up with a mastectomy anyway. 5.) The location of my lump was also a factor.  It was just behind and below the aereola and would likely leave a dent. 6.)Finally,  I never liked my real breasts anyway! :) As others have mentioned, it is right for everyone.  For me it was. ",

Has anyone with similar stats decided against chemotherapy? Adjuvant Online shows only a 3-4% benefit in overall survival with chemo. Based on answers to other questions and a lot of reading of the threads, I understand most opt for chemo in this situation. I don't believe I am eligible for Oncotype testing as I'm pre-menopausal with a positive node. I don't mind doing chemo for a reasonable benefit; I'm just not sure a 3-4% absolute benefit is worth it!
