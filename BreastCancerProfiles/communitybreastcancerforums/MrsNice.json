I'm still wearing a maxipad in the side of my bra to catch the little spots of fluid, and I'm almost 3 weeks post-op but there's still a little every now and then.

Also, a person is not defined by their hair.  Allow yourself some time to recover from the shock, and then try to find some scarves, or even a wig, that makes you feel good.  There are some really good wigs these days that, if fitted properly, are nearly undetectable.   Maybe your mom or a friend can go shopping with you today?

Last Wednesday (day 15 after first AC chemo infusion) my hair started coming out in small handfuls by just running my hand through my hair.  I have (had) lots and lots of fine, curly hair so I decided to cut it off because I didn't want to deal with the mess of having it come out in clumps.  Our golden retriever does that enough!!  Jennifer cuts hair for my entire family (me, DH, DD and DS) and offered to come to my house to cut my hair, no charge.  Very sweet!  Anyway, she took the bulk of length off with scissors, and then used her trimmer to buzz it down, first to a level 4, then to a level 2.  It feels like a butch, but having the little tiny hairs fall out is no big deal for me, and at least whatever washes out in the shower won't clog my drains! I don't have a wig yet so I've just been wearing hats or scarves when I go out.  At home, my head is free!  It does feel good in a way, and \"getting ready\" is much easier without having to do my hair.  I ordered wigs on Friday; I have a \"large\" head in terms of wig cap size, so the pickins are slim.  I look forward to having a wig, but probably won't wear it too much until I go back to work in mid-November. Monday I go to the \"Look Good, Feel Better\" class, so I am excited to see what kinds of makeup tips they have for us hairless girls. Eyelashes (which were very scarce to begin with) are starting to come out too, especially when I take off mascara.  I'm hoping I can wear falsies; but if not, then eyeliner will be my new best friend! Have a good week, girls!  Blessings to all!",

I can tell you that so far I have learned that much of what is to be discovered is left up to the patient, so please arm yourself with information, reach out to friends/coworkers/neighbors who have been down this road, and of course use the internet but be careful to read \"authentic\" information in the medical field and not just the 'alternative' info - although much of that can be helpful as well. Don't let fear cripple you - find out as much as you can about your individual diagnosis, find the best doctors available to you, and prepare yourself to kick some ass.  Cancer is not a weak foe - but if you know all the info, you can beat it and live a long, lovely life. I pray that you are not dismayed.  Your faith may be tested, but if you are a woman of faith in Christ you will find that He will carry you through this.  Even if you prayed (as I did) that you would not have cancer - and you do - understand that the path ahead will be peaceful and wrought with love if you rely on Him whom has brought you to it.

Now, I started out with pretty large (DD) breasts, and didn't mind losing some size if necessary.  My main deciding factor was, \"once you take it off, you can't put it back.\"  That's just my approach that I am comfortable with, understanding the risk that more surgery may be required if I get a recurrence.  I'd rather consider that if it comes up than lose a part of my body on the \"what if\" scenario.  Again, just my personal choice.  I've not decided on any reconstruction yet but am leaning toward not.  If I did any, it would be a reduction of my healthy breast so they match, but I may be just as content to wear a partial prostheses on the surgery side to balance it out.  Please ask your surgeon to fully describe what the 12-3 o'clock quadrant involves; if it is a full quadrant that needs to be removed, then depending on your size that may or may not be an acceptable outcome.  I encourage you to take the time to consider your options and make a decision that you are comfortable with.  You can PM me if you like, and I also have a blog that describes my journey so far.  www.kathyinwonderland.wordpress.com Keep visiting here and let us know how you are doing.  This is a wonderful community of women (and a few men) who are very caring and supportive.",

I had a re-excision lumpectomy on Thursday and am home recovering comfortably.  It was a re-excision because I had surgery in May to remove what turned out to be a B9 fibroid, but I also had nip discharge that was bloody, and that area turned out to be cancer, although my surgeon expected it to be a ductal papilloma.  None of the \"suspicious\" spots in my breast were visible on mammo, ultrasound, or MRI.  We just had to get it out to find out what it was. Each relationship is different and only you can decide what is right for your family; I told my husband right away so he would understand my anxiety.  We didn't tell our kids (ages 12 and 16) until my first surgery was scheduled, and of course now they know everything.  Learn as much as you can, but also take several deep breaths and try to enjoy your day-to-day moments with the people you love.  Stressing about it will not change the outcome.

Anyway, I wanted to let you know I'm being treated at UCSD in La Jolla, part of the UC system in California.  If you can get to UCSF and your insurance will cover it, I wholeheartedly endorse the care I've received.  (Although I imagine whatever Stanford has is quite elite as well.)  I went to UCSD for a 2nd opinion after my first surgeon and oncologist told me I had to have a mastectomy.  My primary care doc told me it would be good to get a 2nd opinion, even if I ended up staying with my original surgeon/onco team.  Well, when I met the surgeon at UCSD it was a no-brainer.  She was very positive about preserving as much of my own body as possible, which she did.  She is also a very highly-regarded plastic surgeon so when I'm ready for reconstruction next summer I won't have to find another doc, and all my info is in the same system.  I'm blessed to have excellent insurance through Aetna and feel very fortunate to be able to be treated there. As for the mammo vs. MRI topic, well, my 3 cm tumor never showed on any mammo and wasn't really distinct on the MRI (which was not a breast coil-type MRI, but that's another story).  Even once we knew where it was located, an ultrasound couldn't depict it either.  And yes, better life through pharmaceuticals is one of my mottos!!  If you need help sleeping, calming down, whatever, take the meds.  We need all the help we can get to deal with this beast.

My onco explained it this way -  having micromets in one sentinel node was an indication that the cancer was able to travel from its origin to a sentinel node, AND learned how to duplicate itself there (even though on a very tiny scale).  If it could do that, then chemo would give me a better chance of non-recurrence.  Radiation reduces the chances by another 50%, so I'll be doing that too. So I guess the bottom line is - if you're willing to do chemo anyway, would having the ALND change your mind?  OR, does your onco want to know about the additional nodes in order to determine the appropriate treatment regimen? I know, lots of if/then/what-if scenarios.  I'm just not sure about the radiation issue with tissue expanders. Kathy",

It has been a long while since my last post (Dec. 19th!).  I'm not entirely sure why I've been away, except that for awhile there I really didn't want to chat about cancer anymore, especially during the holidays.  Then I found myself getting into a major funk for quite some time, especially around the topic of depression, changing SSRI meds to work with tamoxifen, and starting radiation in late December.  Sometimes I felt like I was the Debbie downer, and other times I felt myself getting sucked into a pity party, and I didn't like either of those scenarios.  My typical response to uncomfortable situations is to bail out, so that's what I did.   A bit of information overload, crisis responses, and alarming \"what if\" scenarios.  There's only so much a girl can take! I went back to work, part-time, on January 3rd, which was about the end of my 2nd week of radiation.  The fatigue kicked my booty and \"re-entry\" wasn't so good.  One day I went home and took a nap from 4:30pm to 8:00pm, got up and had a bowl of cereal for dinner, then went right back to bed and slept until 9:00am the next morning.  I knew to expect fatigue, but I didn't expect it to be so severe. Having been back to work for a month, I now completely understand \"chemo brain\".  I am nowhere near the sharp-minded gal I used to be and made several mistakes in those first few weeks.  I've been double- and triple-checking my work because I'm so unsure of myself.  Just today I went to a meeting that isn't scheduled until Thursday.  Then, this evening (Tuesday), I thought it WAS Thursday and wanted to be sure to record Grey's Anatomy.  Very disheartening to think I am that checked out. Today was my last regular radiation treatment.  All in all, the 28 radiation treatments over the last 5 ½ weeks were bearable, but somewhat \"trying\" and exhausting.  It took a total of about 2 hours every day, including drive time.  Add to that at least 4 hours at work plus an hour drive time for that commute, and the days are about as full as I can handle for now.  I started out using Miaderm cream on my skin every day during treatment.  As for side effects from the radiation, I developed a 3\" oval black spot (yes, black!) in the lower region of my armpit about the end of the 2nd week.  That spot proceeded to peel, but started to heal up pretty quickly.  By the 3rd week I began to develop more skin \"breakdown\" in two different areas, which quickly became (and remain) quite raw and painful.  My RO gave me Silvadene cream along with a lidocaine gel to mix with it.  That combination certainly brings comfort to my sad skin.  When the pain is strong enough to wake me during sleep, I take Percocet.  The rest of the time I take prescription strength Naprosyn, which is 2½ times the over-the-counter strength of Aleve. I've had a couple episodes of near-meltdown during radiation.  One day, while I lay on the table, I felt like I was sort of floating but also being pushed around the room, which is understandable since the table moves and the machine moves around me.  I guess fatigue and stress can make you sort of hallucinate during those vulnerable times.  I just felt really light-headed and loony.  Another day, my breast was so sore I just did not even want to go to the clinic.  It took every bit of grit I could muster to stay still on the table until the treatment was over.  The techs who handle my treatments are awesome but I just don't want to fall apart on their shift.  They have so many people to take care of. Certainly there has been so much activity on my favorite topics that I have missed, and I hope you all don't think less of me for being away.  I found so many discussions here SO helpful and all you ladies (and a few men!) so supportive; I know that my knowledge resources were vastly improved just for reading all your posts.  I will continue to check in occasionally and will post when I can.  This has been an indescribable year of changes for us all and I pray each of you are coping the best you can, making the best of the life you have ahead of you, and that all of us will increase the numbers of survivors for future statistics in years to come.
