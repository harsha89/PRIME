The breast is composed of a collection of glands and fatty tissue which lies between the skin and chest wall. After the birth of a baby, these glands in a womans breast begin to produce milk to nourish the infant. Each milk gland is composed of 1520 lobes. Special ducts (tubelike structures) serve to transfer the milk from the glands to the nipple. As milk is produced and fills the breast, the glands and ducts enlarge. Fatty tissue in the breast is the primary factor determining the size and shape of the breast. If a tumor is ever found to be growing in the breast, it should be checked by a doctor as it might be cancerous. www.healthy-class.info Log in to post a reply",
