Yes, This type of breast cancer it's very rare. I did post my diagnosis, but I wish I could have another place where DIAGNOSIS are, so I could post it in there. So far, I can't find no one with same diagnosis as mine. And it would be so nice if I could share this with someone else, as I feel very anxious all the time and also would help me to know which treatment they have received or are receiving, medications , etc. Never I thought one day I would be joining THIS club, but I can honestly tell you, the club was the best thing that happened to me in such a difficult time, because I can see so many caring people, it's overwhelming. Lots o love and big hug. xxxxxxx Nilda.",

But the cancerous cells were hormone receptor, so they removed 15 lymph nodes and 2 of them were compromised. My onco and her team decide not to remove the breast, because in case of recurrence it will be very small if detected( i am having follow ups with ultrasound, mammogram every 6 months) and if this is the case( pray to god NOT) then they will have to remove the breast. I've just follow what the specialist decided, without many questions...when I was first diagnosed, my head was spinning, i thought \"no, this is not happening\" and from then on I did everything as I was told, thinking I am in the best hands. That is why I am desperate to communicate with a person that has the same cancer as mine. Yours is similar, not the same because they actually seen it. When I had the MRI I was sure it would show, but it did not!! Frustration after frustration. I've took Femara for 8 months, but 5 month into the treatment I was extremely sick, I was walking like an 90 years old lady, I am 61 and always walking and moving, love to dance! But Femara took everything from my nice life...I started deteriorating, an just now, after 21 days without taking it, I am my old self again. Hope Femara works for you, as many people are on this medication. I am sure your onco told you how much Femara affects the bones,so you can take meds for that too. I will start on Tamoxifen on the 1st of August. See  how I go. Have a good day! hugs.",

The unknown it's the worse, but my family and I feel the treatments I've received were on target. Although your cancer is different than mine,( mine is estrogen and progesterone positive) I identified with you so much....and I like you to know that I am feeling great, I am on remission, and it seems to me all the dark days are over...I know at the moment you must feeling very miserable, it's only normal, but please, keep strong, even if chemo takes all your energy away, it is more than worth it I can see you have a very caring husband, I couldn't have done it without mine either...I was suffering so much during chemo and then 25 sections of radio, and sometimes I didn't want to continue, but because I love my husband and my son so much, I couldn't be selfish and I kept thinking of them, so I was stronger day after day. Thank you for replying and for the link you've sent me. I wish you all the best with your treatment, and I'll be thinking of you. HUGS xxoooxx",

One and half year later, I went again, to a different GP, a lady doctor..as soon as she saw it, asked me to go to her surgery to remove that little lump. The pathology test came-back positive for cancer. Mammogram did not show anything, Ultrasound or MRI..(??????) Because the cancer cells were hormone receptor , and after having every test that were required, I've had an axillary clearance...15 lymph nodes were removed, 2 were compromised. My diagnosis \" Stage 2, Er positive, PR positive,HER2 Negative. The diagnosed was Occult Breast Carcinoma. It's so scary, as I don't have a family history, and I always had a mammogram once a year. I never thought something like this could happen. I've had 4 months of chemo, 25 sections of radio, and I have to take medication for 5 years. I was diagnosed almost 2 years ago, and my wish was to find somebody with the same diagnosis. It will help me a lot. Please HELP! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
