    "Content": "Aug 7, 2017 12:06PM - edited Aug 7, 2017 12:07PM by Gwin This disease is scary, random (at least from my point of view), and highly disruptive. My husband was like you last summer; taking notes, researching, etc. I am very lucky to have him, and it sounds like you are a great support as well. A few pieces of advice/thoughts: take notes at Dr appointments, practice meditation and focused breathing for the scary times, pray if that's your thing, keep a journal, try to stay away from crazy websites, and above all, remember that she will get through this. Treatment is very effective today. When I was newly diagnosed, I kept saying \"I just want things to go back to the way they were.\" Once I truly made a decision to accept my \"new normal\", I was better equipped to mentally move forward. I also tried to ocus on the idea that living in 2017 allows us many different treatment options. I made a conscious effort to view chemo as a lifesaving medicine. Also, surgery was scary, but I had very little pain afterwards. I consider myself the \"luckiest\" cancer patient in the world. I know that sounds bizarre, but I just went with it and was grateful that there were very few side effects. The very best wishes to you both. You can do this",
