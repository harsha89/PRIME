I feel a lot of pain (throbbing and aches) and I have already started turning pink. Being that it gets progressively worse as treatment goes on, I'm really worried about what is to come. Anybody else have early onset symptoms? Plus I was so lucky to have nausea as I started since it was on my left side. This just doesn't seem like it will be as easy as my dr sai when he said I was going to sail on through. Ugh!!!",
