Thanks, Beth Log in to post a reply",

I just had discovered your blog last week and then read your blog and then I went to your Facebook page thinking it would be the more hip and current place to keep up and interact, right? (not a Facebook person per se) and tried to \"friend\" you and curiously, sadly, surprisingly, I saw no posts for a long time, like a couple of years. And I was thinking uh-oh, oh no! Okay...so I'm relieved to see you're here and just posted a couple of days ago. Just wanted to say that. :)",
