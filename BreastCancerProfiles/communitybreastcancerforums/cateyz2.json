Funny story is early on I did try to sleep in the bed, but couldn't get out in the morning thank goodness my husband hadn't left for work yet and helped me get up. Another funny one was about a 2 weeks after BMX I thought I was ready to drive. I figured I was going to get out of the house for a bit and visit my girlfriend you lives a few miles away. So Igot in my jeep and backed out of the garage but then realized I just didn't have the strength and quick response needed to turn the wheel fast and pulled back into the garage albeit quite crooked. When my son got home he asked who the he** drove my jeep as it was parked pretty much in the middle LOL",

From my experience its important to keep ahead of the pain especially the first few days. I personally took them quite regular for the 1st two weeks for a couple of reasons. They helped me sleep and the body heals the best at rest and also by being \"lazy\" I knew I wouldn't over extend myself. Granted saying that be sure to start stool softener the day before surgery. Also as many of us know insurance companies all to often don't want you overnight in hospital if they have any say in the matter. My BS made sure to let me know in an indirect way that if I wanted to stay another night I should complain of pain and ask for more meds in my IV. It is my understanding that they will not release you within so many hours of having morphine. My surgery was on a friday at 4pm, out of recovery and in my room about 930-10pm, BS came to see me Sat around 2 and asked if I was ready to go home and if not then I needed to tell nurse I was in quite of bit of pain which I did and was not released until Sunday about 1pm with no argument with insurance about my 2 night stay. This also worked out to my benefit as my husband and kids would be around sunday to help me",

Surgery went well this is what my PS told my DH while I was still in postop recovery Instuctions: no driving (??? need to call PS office today to find out for how long and if I will need a ride for follow up appointment on Monday) No lifting over 6lbs No showering until bandage/tube top removed Keep gauze bandages on til Friday/ do not remove steri strips Perscriptions for Hydrocodone and Keflex Only discomfort/pain is in the area of my sternum where he released a little more muscle to move implants closer to give me more cleavage. My final implant was allergan smooth round style 20 in 550cc. I was hoping for the style 45 for just a bit more projection but PS decides which one looks the best at time of surgery, and I know he had to clean up the BMX scar a bit.",

I have been dealing with the worst constipation in my life. I even had to reschedule my post op apt with PS from yesterday to tomorrow. After drinking 10oz of magnesium nitrate yesterday morning, things are finally starting to move although very slowly. Its my understanding this is given to people before having colonoscopy to completely clean them out and should do the trick in 1/2 hour to 5 hours. Well its now been 24 hours and Im starting to get some relief. Lets just say Ive been miserable",

Lumpectomy with 6 weeks of radiation 5x per week and tamoxin for 5 yrs or (B) Masectomy. As I did not want to go thru radiation or medication I choose to do Nipple Sparing Bilateral Mastectomy with TE Reconstruction. My surgery was 5/31 and so far everything is going well. Very small amount of tissue necrosis, but looks like it is healing up nicely. As I am out in the country I did choose a different BS( He specializes in NSM and PS closer to city.3 and 1/2 weeks post op and feeling good, still have minimum uncomfort, tightness in chest from TEs, but overall doing well. Been driving for a little over 1 wk and am not taking any pain meds except for the occasional percocet at bed for a good nights sleep. The bestnews I can say is that 0/2 of my SLN had cancer, so no other treatment necessary and I will still have follow up mams just for the VERY small chance of recurrance in the little bit of breast tissue left. Did your Dr say anything to you with regards to radiation if you have lumpectomy?? My understanding is that it is standard protocall for lumpectomy. If you have any specific questions, just ask.",

Not sure what you meant about immediate reconstruction. There are 2 types a. with TEs is considered immedite because it starts at time of masectomy, and b. where permanent implants are placed with alloderm (a type of donor skin). As far as size, search for forum \"Implant sizing 101\" and post your weight, ribbcage measurement and whippetmom will respond with suggested size implant. She is extremely knowledgeable. In addition once you have posted a few times also search for \"picture forum\" and ask nowheregirl to be added and there you can look at pictures that some of us ladies have posted during various stages. It really helps with preparing yourself for this journey we are on.",
