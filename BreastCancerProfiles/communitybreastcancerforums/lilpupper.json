My left nipple also has discharge and flaky/crusty skin, and the skin seems to have thickened considerably. The discharge is not from my actual nipple umm, 'hole' though, its from the injured looking skin of my areola and nipple. I had and ultrasound today and am waiting for the results from my doctor.",

My ultrasound order was somehow lost and it took many calls and nearly a week to get it to the hospital via fax. I guess it's harder than it looks to work a fax machine? I don't blame anyone but it was very frustrating. My ultrasound is also scheduled for tomorrow. I wish you luck and am sending prayers your way.",

I'm 22. I went to my gynecologist, got an ultrasound (all clear) and just today I went to a dermatologist who told me she thinks its exzema of the nipple and prescribed me a steroid cream. Very frustrating since I've already tried steroid creams but I hope it works anyway. Biopsy is the only thing that can definitively rule padget's out but it seems to only be considered when all other options have been exhausted. Pagets is also extremely unlikely but I'm sure you know that and like you I just want this problem gone. You're not alone at least.",

I know it's silly. Thank you so much for the response! I'll make sure to report any updates here after my appt.",

      "Content": "lilpupper wrote: Okay so, Hi. I've been having problems with my left nipple since the start of the year pretty much (5- 6 months ago) It started out as a dry spot on the underside of my nipple, and I really didn't give it a second thought. Fast forward a few months, the dry spot spreads, starts flaking and gets scaly (once it looked like a tortoiseshell!), spreads to a large portion of the areola. I turn to cortisone cream (consistently for around a month) and it seems to moisturize the area, making it look nicer but does not get rid of anything. At the start, the 'situation' would almost seem to disappear sometimes and that encouraged me to think of it as nothing more than a weird skin thing. Now it's always there and recently there have been troubling developments. Little gashes started appearing when flakes came off, like raw skin maybe. I thought I felt a bump/lump/hard-er spot on the underside of my nipple (where it all started) and looking closely there's a gash right in the center of that area. The shape of my left nipple is distorted, elongated (like an oval rather than a circle) and just looks plain weird to me compared to my other nipple. (It's also flat? Like the top of the nipple is flat, not rounded.) My left side has always been my bigger breast, so the nipple as always been slightly larger but never like this. At times the nipple looks squashed/retracted but never inverted. Lately its less flaky and more crusty? In the past week, two distinct sores have formed (one at ground zero lol) and they aren't scabbing over or healing whatsoever and leak a liquid that looks clear but on a band-aid looks yellow/straw colored. It's painful and annoying. I currently have toilet paper stuffed in my sports bra and ugh... It feels like I'm living with an open wound 24/7, it's horrible and painful and humiliating. This whole situation is taking its toll on my mental state. I already suffer from anxiety and depression and lately I can barely manage to get out of the house, or see friends even. This isn't the only thing contributing to that, but it certainly does not help. I have an appointment with my PCP on June 29th but he's, well, a 'he', and I wish that didn't matter to me but it does. So I found a GYNO, who's a woman, and that appointment is July 6th and I'll be bringing this up then. Oh! I almost forgot, my right nipple has recently (within 1 month) developed a dry spot on the underside of the nipple. This seems like the same starting point my left nipple went through. Yay. From what I read this is a positive sign since Paget's is usually unilateral (and I'm only 22 years old!), but I really can't bring myself to feel uplifting. I'm paranoid that I'm over-reacting. But I also fear that when I see the doctor, she'll tell me to try some fungal or steroid cream and it could be a waste of time? I want a punch biopsy (which I've learned from my extensive research on these very forums) because I think that nothing else would quiet my mind. One last thing: steroid creams (and other forms of steroid) cause my face to break out, badly. I am very attentive to my skincare and this causes me significant emotional turmoil. So I was very desperate to try steroid creams for an extended period of time. I felt this was worth mentioning, don't ask me why lol I guess I'm posting for everyone's thoughts and some self comfort. To get this off my chest, ya know? I'd love to hear from anyone! Log in to post a reply",
