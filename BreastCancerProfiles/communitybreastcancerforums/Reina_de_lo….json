I used to hike, and exercise regularly, but my body can't take it anymore. My legs ache so bad-- really painful cramps all up and down. The bottoms of my feet hurt too. I was having joint pain, but I've been taking glucosamine for a month now, and my joints feel better now. I also have the sweats that was mentioned, but I'm pretty sure that's the menopause that was starting when chemo started. Like what I've heard, I take it day by day. I work full time teaching second grade, and that can wear me out sometimes. But I'm grateful that I can work, and enjoy what I do. Also, I don't feel depressed at all. I do have some anxious moments, and can get stressed, but Itry to remain grateful. I figure it could be worse. When I spoke with my oncologist last month about this pain, she suggested a couple of things. I just messaged her to tell her I'm still in pain. So we'll see what she says. Hang in there! I think we're all here for a reason...",

I actually think I look like an old bald man, with the hair texture of a sheep-- baaaaa! After reading, it sounds like I should leave it alone. I'm also going to try some of that hair color recommended. Diana, I sighed when I saw your hair. I would like mine to look like that. I'm 7 weeks out, and feel old and ugly. Wigs make me hot too, so I wear a cap when I'm out. Now the ugly grey hair is starting to show by my ears, so I'm a bit self-conscious. Thanks for posting, Ladies! So nice to know I'm not alone in this. :D",

Reading the other posts, I have the same issues. Mostly trying to find a bra I like (which really has ALWAYS been my issue), but also finding a prosthesis that I like. Swimsuits are the toughest, but I'm still looking. My right side is about a C cup, so it's kind of awkward if I don't wear a bra. The comfortable bra I have doesn't support my foob well, and I'm constantly adjusting it. My silicone breast stays put the best, but sets off the TSA screeners. It's not a big deal, I just say I have a prosthetic breast, they pat me down, and I'm on my way. I'm not usually embarrassed about having one breast. It was my choice not to have reconstructive surgery, and I'm still happy with my decision. I'd say-- you do you, Boo! It's nice to have choices, and this forum to share ideas. Rock that \"I kicked cancer's ass\" scar! But if you find you're too uncomfortable, go for the surgery. :D Dawn",
