But since cancer cells are so fast growing, it makes sense to limit sugars and simple carbs. That's true for good health in general. That said, during chemo I was told the main thing was that I keep my weight up. I'll go back to a healthier diet after I'm done, but right now I eat whatever seems most appealing, including white rice, white pastas and ice cream. I was not told not to drink. MY MO didn't address alcohol at all. I'm having a glass of red wine right now. For several days the thought of wine was a little repulsive to me, but I am not worried about a glass of wine or a beer in the evening. This is hard enough without giving up little pleasures!

Now that you have your start date in early October, I hope you will continue with this thread in addition to the October thread. My chemo started 8/31, so this seemed like the best group for me.

KK - That is a whole lot of appointments to have every week. I have that same feeling about FB memories popping up. It feels like a whole different life. No clue what was waiting around the corner  So I had one of the weirder freak occurrences in this whole process. Backstory: I woke up from my exchange surgery in early August with a completely numb foot and have been stumping around like a pirate ever since. My foot has gradually regained a little movement and feeling, but not entirely, and stays really swollen. Apparently pressure was put on a calcification (which I've had since childhood and has never caused problems before) because of the way I was positioned during that long surgery, and it damaged a nerve at my ankle. But nothing could be done until I was four weeks out of chemo. So yesterday I had surgery to remove the thing, which was identified on my chart as a \u201clesion of unknown behavior.\u201d But it turned out to be more complicated than they were expecting, and they had to move the nerve and cut out part of my tibia. I left with instructions not to be upright for more than five minutes an hour for a full week because the tibia is the bone that supports most of your weight on your lower leg. Between the cut bone and the nerve being moved, my ankle hurts like the dickens. Good times. Still I'm thankful for a kind and skilled surgical team, including an anesthesiologist who fetched me an extra blanket and said, \"We want to take extra special care of you because you're a survivor. And when we're done today, you go back to kicking cancer's butt.\"",

When I had what I thought were mouth sores with TC, the onc prescribed diflucan - he said he thought it was thrush. I don't know, but it helped. Fairchild - I thought the recuperation was much, much easier for the exchange surgery. Mine took almost 4 hours (compared to the 7 hours of the mastectomy), but recovery was so much faster. I was in recovery for 3 hours with the mastectomy (they couldn't get my BP up), and out pretty quickly with the exchange. Not sure of the exact time, but it was day surgery vs. the overnight stay of the BMX. And there wasn't nearly the physical impairment that you get with a mastectomy. But the biggest part was the pure relief of having those expanders, which I hated, out. I woke up from the exchange surgery in a compression bra and there were a couple of layers of plastic stuff over the incision sites. No steri strips. I had to wear that bra for two weeks except for showers. (plus compression undies because I had fat grafting). I took two weeks off work, which was how long it was before I could drive again. And I worked just part-time that first week back. I was sore, but it just didn't feel as overwhelmingly awful as the BMX. beeline - Other groups go on for a long time - I see no reason why we can't. No reason you can't follow different threads. Besides, chemo is only part of this journey. I want to hear how things go for all of us! I sure hope the new onc grows on you and listens to you. That's so important. So, will you be starting on tamoxifen? I've been on the 20 mg for 10 weeks now, with no real side effects.",

It really sounds terribly unpleasant, and I hope you guys heal up soon. So, can I vent for a second? I got a 30 minute massage voucher as part of my integrative care consult and went today. The massage therapists are in the cancer center and work primarily with cancer patients. In fact, the IC doc said breast cancer patients are the majority of their clients. I told the woman I couldn't lie flat on my belly and she rolled up towels to put under me (which helped). But when I commented that I hadn't expected how rigid the implants would be, she said, \"I guess that's the price you pay for perfect breasts.\" I was floored. I said something probably incoherent about how I had had a mastectomy and the implants were so I'd have some sort of breasts, but I didn't like them. She didn't say anything, but by then I was crying. (Face down, and quietly, so she didn't know.) I spent the first ten minutes of the massage telling myself to just let it go. And then she asked what stage I was and when I said one, she laughed and said, \"Then it's all in the rear view mirror for you!\" What?? So I guess I should stop taking my tamoxifan and erase any stories of recurrence I hear from my mind? I just said, \"Not exactly. I had a very aggressive cancer.\" But I shouldn't have to say that. If it had just been some goombah on the street, I could overlook it, but this is someone who is a professional who works in a freaking cancer center. I will never go back, but I haven't decided if I need to tell someone about what happened.",

I have a few friends who bought wigs, wore them a few times and then decided they were too uncomfortable. But I also know another therapist who always wore hers to work.

I'm working on getting gifts together for the kids and planning a Christmas meal.So, I had to pick something up at WalMart today on a break at work and my cashier looked at my headscarf and said, \"Do you have hair?\" I was floored - seemed insanely rude. But I answered politely that no I didn't, because of chemo. She pointed at her own head and said, \"Me, too, this is a wig.\" Oh! So just an awkward way to start a conversation about breast cancer!

Interesting about the different oncotype scores. Tumors vary depending on what bit is sampled. So the score is part of it, but so is the \u201cwhy\u201d of your score. Hormone receptor positivity is on a continuum, so the effectiveness of endocrine therapies depends on how strongly or weakly positive, and on the percentage of cells that are positive. Mine, for instance, was 64% ER+ so the tamoxifen I\u2019m taking has benefit for some of my cells but not others. And on the oncotype, my cancer veered toward the triple negative side on a molecular level. For my situation, chemo made all the sense in the world, even though I was node negative and got clean margins. What does your oncologist say? I ended up consulting with two oncologists and my breast surgeon before deciding to proceed. And remember that after surgery, a subset of people will never get cancer again no matter what they do. It\u2019s just impossible to know which group you\u2019ll fall into when you are looking at the stats.I\u2019d go with expert opinions over what we can tell you here.

I'm trying to drink lots and lots of water to keep flushing the poisons out. @Tigerlily - Was your neulasta injector on your arm or belly? Mine was on my belly and even though I was lying perfectly still, I could feel it after about 10 minutes. Sort of a pinching, but it only lasted another 10-15 minutes. Maybe just the movement of my breathing made it so I could feel it. No bone aches yet. ",

Even though everyone's journey is different, it helps to be able to hear about what the possibilities are and have the support. So thanks, all! I'm starting day 4, with nothing more serious yet than mild stomach cramps and tiredness. I'll admit that when I woke up after a pretty good night's sleep, my husband went off for a bike ride and I just went back to sleep for a while. I've taken regular claritin daily for years so I had a little fear that I'm habituated to it so I'm doubling the dose for the first few days of the neulasta. No bone pain yet. I'd like to be moving more but I had a surgical complication last month that left me with pretty bad neuropathy in one foot and can't walk more than about a block without serious pain. I'm guessing it will require another surgery to fix once the chemo is behind me. Anybody here have a port? Mine is still so sore at the incision sites. I am thinking I might wear something soft like a silk scarf over it when I go back to work Friday so it would be so obvious. @JNKK - let us know how your first round today goes!",

Mouth sores, some bone pain, and an upset stomach and I was up until 4 am, mostly related to neuropathy from my surgery.

Otherwise, node negative, clean margins, and I\u2019m 55. I had a 26% recurrence chance with only tamoxifen, so I dry reluctantly signed on for 4 rounds of TC. But I struggled with the decision even as high as my oncotype was. I had a bilateral mastectomy hoping that would make chemo unnecessary. But I\u2019ve made it through one, so I\u2019m in. Good luck with your decision, and please let us know either way. @pcranky - Ice cream is therapeutic. @hbluv- wonder why the different recommendation on number of TC rounds?

We're on different regimens (Mine's TC). One thing - neulasta doens't guard against bone/joint pain, it causes it. The pain comes from the bones (usually thigh bones and hips) churning out new white blood cells to make up for the ones chemo kills. It sounds like you managed to avoid it, which is great. I'd been advised to use claritin, which helped, but next time I will also take aleve in advance of the nuelasta infusion. Hope your course continues to go pretty smoothly.",

You feel something that feels like the snap of a rubber band when the needle goes in and back out, leaving a tiny plastic cannula in you and you go on home. 27 hours later, it beeps and releases neulasta in for 45 minutes. That really doesn't hurt either, just feels strange. Then you peel it off and discard it. No shot, no going back to the chemo center or doctor's office. Maybe ask if you can have that next round instaad of the 7 shots? That sounds awful to me.",

You know, sometimes I think that what we should be saying when we ring that bell is \"Yay - they're done poisoning me!\" I'm glad the lymphedema massage is helping. That sounds wonderful Brink - I giggled a little at your thought process about your hair/scalp. Yesterday I was cleaning out the bag I take to work and found several hair ties/barrettes in the bottom. Guess I won't be needed those for a long, long time! I think I would be inclined to wear a light cotton cap if I were exercising at a gym. Seems like a scarf would get in the way. beeline - That's hard with sibs who you've been in a sort of parental role with. Same for my youngest brother and sister. Piksie - I know it's scary when it feels like the chemo MUST be causing permanent damage. I have a much milder version of what you're describing - the shooting pains that are worse at night in bed. Like some sort of amped up restless leg syndrome. I really, really hope that eventually resolves as nerves heal post-chemo. sunocean - When will you find out if you can move forward with the chemo? Are they giving you neulasta or anything to get the WBC up? I see my breast surgeon today just for a routine follow-up. It's six months to the day since I had my BMX. It will be nice to go to the hospital and not have anything done to me other than an exam. I really like her, too, so it's comforting to see her. And I'm hoping to get my port removal scheduled while I'm there.",

I saw my breast surgeon yesterday for a follow-up - it had been six months to the day since my mastectomy. She asked how I liked my new breasts and I told her they were uncomfortable but I was getting used to them. She said, \"New normal, huh?\" The other part of my new normal is how frequently I'm sitting in the hospital or some doctor's office. But the visit went well and I don't go back for six months (except to get my port out in February). Oh also, the nurse who I saw first told me to put on the gown \"open at the boobies.\"",

I can only assume its because the tamoxifen has built up in my system? But it's not terrible - very, very mild. Also, tamoxifen has helped bring my cholesterol from 218 to 166!

I'm ready for some warmer weather but it's cool and rainy here. Brink - That chinchilla is both cute and mesmerizing! My mother had told me that when she was in chemo, she would completely lose her appetite the first week, gain it mostly back the second, and then the third eat anything that wasn't nailed down. Turns out, I had the same reaction - that last week I just ate all the time. And it was more true with each round. It was like being pregnant. The mouthwash probably has nystatin in it - I hope it helps! Tigerlily - I sure hope the next zometa round is better. And that you are able to really enjoy the vacation coming up. Bein - What sort of chemo pills? It does seem like a very aggressive approach if you've already done TC. You didn't have lymph node involvement, right? After a couple rounds of telephone tag, I talked with my BS about the bruises on my tongue after my port removal surgery. They're gone now, so at this point I was just curious. She said the anesthesiologist had trouble seating the breathing tube in my mouth and had to maneuver my jaw around by pressing his finger up against my tongue. Mystery solved.  ",

Nothing. Any more than there is anything vain about getting reconstruction after a mastectomy (which I did). This damned cancer takes so much from us. I think it's okay to do whatever you can to minimize that, and if that means a wig, do it! And even though I'm going the cap and scarf route, that doesn't mean I don't stand in front of a mirror looking at my nearly bald head and thinking, \"My God, I look like my Dad!\" I mean, I loved my Dad and I've always looked a lot like him, but I could have gone my whole life without the bald part, you know? pcranky - Is there really such a thing as an easy chemo? I'm skeptical. I think the SEs are different depending on which poisons they put in you, but it's still poison. As for the neck pain, the back of my neck is super sore. I think mine may be muscle pain from holding my neck stiffly with the port. I think it's hard for me to shake the idea that somehow if I move my head too much, I'll yank the port out of my jugular. And die. Because when I worry, I go big. Day 3 after my second round and I feel okay at the moment. But I kept notes the first round and Tuesday was my really bad day. I've been taking claritin and aleve since the day before my chemo, hoping I'll be able to avoid the bone pain this time. We'll see. I had a patient crochet a shawl for me, another bring me some bath stuff, and a third a box of caps she'd used and a heart-shaped pillow she told me to take to each chemo. It was an interesting and wonderful turn-about to have people I've been caring for shower me in love.",

I got all the way through reconstruction before chemo started. I had no node involvement and clean margins, but a very aggressive cancer. And yet, my oncologist doesn\u2019t seem concerned about the delay and we\u2019re proceeding - I\u2019m two rounds down now. I understand your worry - the whole process is crazy-making. But I would encourage you to take some control back and call on Monday to ask where things stand. Sometimes things (like my tumor being sent off) fall between the cracks. Don\u2019t just wait - nudge them. Hell, shove them if you need to. Keep us posted! Elizabeth - I envy your precancer hair - but you look great shaved. I will say several radiologists have told me my extremely dense breasts were a risk factor. I almost always got called back for repeat mammograms and ultrasounds. One radiologist said, \u201cOn a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being the most fatty and 10 being the most dense, you\u2019re an 11.\u201d Still, I thought my healthy lifestyle would protect me. Somehow, an aggressive cancer managed to grow, showing up only as calicifications on my mammogram. It wasn\u2019t until they did a biopsy, just to be safe, that they found IDC. So yeah, women need not only to be told dense tissue is a risk, the need to have it explained how dangerous it really is. I don\u2019t think I really understood the level of risk until I was diagnosed",

My husband said I was so zonked out he almost called a nurse over. But it was a faster round this time, and I didn't mind sleeping through most of it. This round was only about 21/2 hours. I'm feeling okay, although I know now from experience that I'll start to slide after my neulasta onpro goes off tonight. Unfortunately tomorrow night is our neighborhood block party, which I'll be skipping for the first time. My sister-in-law, who has been a rock through my cancer, just had a routine colonoscopy and was diagnosed with colon cancer, with possible liver and spine involvement. She's a lovely person and I hate this for her.

There are definitely times when the nipples have to go because the tumor is too close, but to do it for a better line is inexcusable. It was something my BS and I had discussed in advance. She also let the PS talk her into making the incision in the inframammary fold, which she doesn't generally do because it's more difficult. After the surgery when she stopped by to check in, the BS said, \"Well, you gave me a run for my money!\" And trust me, I'm a work in progress when it comes to defaulting to kindness.

I usually eat \"breakfast\" at 11:15, just because that's the first opportunity for me later in the morning. Most days it's oatmeal with nuts and dried fruit and flax. Eggs and vegetables on the weekends. I drink my coffee black and as long as I have it in the morning, I don't really get hungry before then. Could you make a smoothie and take it to work with you? Tigerlily - So glad the Florida trip is going better than Hawaii. I'm going to be in FL myself at the end of next week. Can't wait! beeline - Oh, no worries! I am on both the August and September threads because my chemo started August 31st. I guess it makes sense that on the chemo thread we're all going to be on board with conventional science-based treatment. But it has been odd to encounter hostility about it. Because exactly - we're just doing what we can to live. As for hair - I have a friend who had light brown hair and when hers came back in, it was white at first then white and gray, then gray, and then brown. So you never know. I think my diet is extremely healthy, but I still have a glass of wine most nights. Or the occasional IPA or whiskey. KK - Oh, good for you! You look like you're having a blast! I went to Tulum a million years ago on my honeymoon (in my first marriage). It's quite a climb.",

She also said, \"Whoever did your breasts did a great job!\" Which made me laugh out loud.",

Also, I signed up at chemoangels.com and they assigned two angels to me. One sends cards (she even sent my husband a birthday card), the other little gifts (I've gotten a word find book, a bracelet with a little breast cancer angel on it, and three packs of ginger chews).

One is that during my exchange surgery something happened (nerve damage/impingement) so that for the last 6 weeks I've had severe neuropathy in one foot. I woke up from surgery and said I couldn't feel my left foot and I was assured it was temporary. Since then my PCP thinks it's damage from the sharp edge of the tool they use when harvesting fat from my groin and my plastic surgeon thinks it's more localized at the tarsal tunnel of my foot. I had been told, unofficially, by my PCP that the hard knot I've always had above my ankle is a ganglion cyst but he's certain that's uninvolved, even though it's right where the pain starts. My PS thinks it could well be pressing on a nerve. At any rate, I was prescribed lyrica for the nerve pain by my PCP and he was setting up a referral to neurosurgery. Two days ago, my ankle started swelling and today the PCP set up an urgent venous ultrasound this morning, fearing DVT. Thankfully, there was no blood clot and I asked the US guy to look at the presumed ganglion cyst. He says it's pretty well calcified because it's been there so long. I saw my PS next and she had discussed my case with a podiatrist and has me set up on Tuesday to see her. And I have to go back this afternoon to followup with the PCP. What a stupid complication from breast surgery! But I can't walk or stand without pain and can't even stand to take a shower. Which means I'm now taking baths with my buzzed hair falling into the water around me. I'm a little worried about this podiatry appointment being set up on what was my worst day the first round, but I'm holding my breath and planning to medicate myself throughly to guard against bone pain and GI issues. Seem slike with any treatment in all this, there's some additional thing that needs treatment. Okay, phew - had to get that rant of despair out there!",

Pre-divorce we started traveling with the kids when my youngest was 6 (and the other 9). They got to see the Serengeti, the rainforest in Costa Rica and sail in the West Indies as well as SF/Yosemite, and after divorce their dad took them to Yellowstone and I took them to Nova Scotia. I think traveling really changes kids. Now that mine are grown, I'm trying to go somewhere every year myself. Robyn - It seems to vary so much by person. And my first round was different from my second. The first one I had bone pain, but I medicated it second time and avoided it, but the second round I had nausea. I think what has struck me is how much more tired I am this time. KK - Travel, food and wine - me, too! BeingPositive - I was already taking claritin daily for allergies and still had bone pain the first round. HATED that, so second round I took claritin twice a day starting the day of chemo through day 7, and also took aleve during those days. Not a hint of bone pain that round. I'm hoping it will work again when I have my next round this Friday. The lumpectomy vs. mastectomy is a tough one. Such a personal decision and my breast surgeon wouldn't even offer an opinion since survival rates are the same. The slightly higher chance of a local recurrence scared me and radiation also scared me, so I went with a mastectomy. But I was most influenced by my mother's history - she had a local recurrence after a lumpectomy, radiation and chemo and ended up having a mastectomy after all. But obviously that doesn't happen to everyone. I wish you luck making a decision that feels comfortable (as much as any of this can feel comfortable) for you. Any one else get more tired the further in they get? I feel like I'm walking through mud by the end of the day.",

Similar to Piksie, I've let everything slide in term eating and activity, feeling just like it didn't matter while I was in chemo. But a few days ago, I had a change of heart. I think it helps to be seeing light at the end of the tunnel. I can't be as active as I'd like until I get my ankle operated on end of November, but I have started walking short distances again and doing some arm weights. Not a lot, but it's a start. And I've been seriously rethinking how I've been eating, trying to move toward more veggies, fruits, whole grains and cutting out processed foods. I'll cut myself a ton of slack the week after chemo, but then get back on track again. I want to start feeling like there will be health after cancer. Tigerlily, I've been reading voraciously, period. Lots more time to read with the time off work. Lots of books about cancer and about health/nutrition, but also lots of novels. I'll have a look at that book. So, I'm on Day 10 after my 3rd TC and thought I was done with all the symptoms (other than general fatigue and bleckiness). I had a brutal mouth sore on my tongue for a couple of days, but that had resolved Yesterday, though, I noticed in the shower that when I rub a washcloth on my skin, it kind of sloughs off. Like I've just done some big exfoliation treatment or something. And last night, I had the worst dry mouth out of the blue. Bad enough that it kept me awake. And here's the weirdest thing: My sister texted me to say she was finally watching the Flight of the Conchords London special on Netflix. I responded that I'd have to find it and watch it, too. I mentioned it to my husband and he stared at me as if I'd lost my mind. He said, \"But we did watch it about a week or so ago! The whole thing! You said you liked it, but not as much as their old stuff!\" I had zero memory of that. I scrolled back through texts to my sister, and saw that on the evening of my last chemo, I had told her we were watching it. And still, it didn't ring a bell. A total memory wipe from that evening. Talk about chemo brain!",

I think taking it off for the last time will really help me feel like I'm on my way out of chemo.

Sunocean - Welcome and I hear you on feeling that chemo is just the beginning of a life-changing road. You're right about that. The chemo ends, but often there are still surgeries or endocrine therapy ahead, and a long road of healing and adjusting to the changes in your body. This is the place to vent about it! BeingPositive - I hope the advil helped. It's an agonizing decision you have to make, to be sure. I had my mastectomy before chemo and had just a couple of weeks to decided. It felt crazy. Tigerlily - I had been married not quite two years before I was diagnosed but I do believe that a marriage can grow stronger with this sort of trial. You find out for sure that you aren't loved just for your body. As for the \"what if\" of it happening before you signed on the dotted line - my husband (who was 49 at the time) had a stroke while we were engaged. I remember thinking as I sat with him in the neuro CCU that whatever happened, it changed absolutely nothing for me - I still very much wanted to get married. Brink - is it an allergic reaction to the skin care products or a chemo skin change? Piksie - Glad your first Taxol went well. Maybe you have time to put in a request for them to install a bell? I think they should be standard in all infusion centers. I can't imagine forgetting all this in 7 yers, either. Or ever. What a great photo! 8 days PFC and I have to echo what Tigerlily said about this last round being both harder and easier. I have a hell of a sore on my tongue (which the diflucan seems to be clearing up) and I still feel like my legs are made of cement. But I think there was a huge psychological boost of knowing it was the last time I'd cycle through all the side effects so they just don't didn't bother me as much. I find myself obsessing a bit about my hair (the little fluffy hairs on my head look so weird to me!) and wondering when I'll ever have to shave my legs again. But all in all, I find myself more hopeful than I've felt in a good long time. Now I just need to get through the surgery where the nerve damage that happened gets fixed.",

She still talks about the chemo nurses and about how tired she used to be when she was teaching while going through treatments. So maybe memory loss is really variable. Or maybe some people don't want to remember and push it from their minds. And thanks about the Tamoxifen - that's encouraging. I start mine on 12/01. I took L-Glutamine throughout myTC infusions and never had any issues with neuropathy.",

I can\u2019t imagine what people think when I open the door looking like that and panting from the effort. I was able to read my surgery report on the patient portal. The calcification in my ankle that got pressed into a nerve during my reconstructionsurgery was attached within the muscle and also attached to the bone and was \"not only significant in size but also directly pressing against the neurovascular bundle\" so they had to use power tools to get it out and send it to pathology in pieces. So glad I was out for all that! The pathology results say it\u2019s benign and even though I knew it was an unlikely site for bone mets, I still breathed a huge sigh of relief. I guess we will just always be under that shadow now.",

And I do the same thing - I look around me when I'm in public and feel very different. As we were sitting in the waiting room at the foot surgeon's, I told my husband I felt more comfortable in the oncology section of the hospital because there were more people like me. I'm glad you were able to reach a decision that fits for you with surgery. I felt the same way when I opted for a BMX - just wanted off the mammogram/biopsies merry-go-round. My oncotype was elevated, too - 38. I was terrified the night before my BMX. But somehow, you just get through it. I know you will - the fact that you got through chemo should tell you you're stronger than you think. Fairchild - I am Her2 negative. I just had taxotere and cytoxan. I hate that you have to continue the HP for a year. :( I got really variable support from my sibs, most of them really absent even though I told them I needed to hear from them. But on FB they had lots of supportive things to say! I finally just shut down my FB temporarily because I decided they didn't get it both ways. My hair grew a little during chemo. I'd have a wave of it falling out, then it would rally a little, then next round fall out again. I never lost 100% of it, but I got pretty darn close to bald. And the growth I'm having now is very feathery. I can only see it if I am close to the mirror.",

I think it is necessary to acknowledge the times when having cancer feels unfair and scary and like you've been cheated. Because that's all true. I have to let myself have those moments to free me up to appreciate what is good in my life still. That's good that you got the baseline bone density test so you can see how any hormone therapy affects your bones. I had mine done coincidentally when I had the mammogram that started this whole mess for me. For the first time today, I found myself able to imagine a life beyond being completely immersed in cancer. I am starting to think about wanting to travel again and imagining projects for this summer - life gardening and cooking, which I totally gave up this year. We went to a Winter Solstice party last night and are going to a Christmas party tonight and it feels really good to want to be around people again.

Sunocean - Why would they do a SNB on the unaffected breast? I had a BMX with cancer only on the left and the surgeon just did the SNB on the left side. Seems like the more nodes you remove, the greater the risk of lymphedema. But maybe she has some reason for offering? It is indeed a tough decision about whether or not to take the non-cancer breast while you're at it. I just wanted to be done, too. Sue - I think lurking is fine when you aren't in a writing place. It's still a way to stay part of the group. Your Christmas dinner sounds delicious to me - I love seafood of all kinds! I was feeding my son's girlfriend as part of ours and she eats no seafood, so I made game hens instead. So you'll finish up late January? A patient was telling me that she had some memory/concentration issues from having four surgeries in ten months, totaling 4.5 hours under general anesthesia. I found myself totaling in my head and realized I'd had four surgeries in 6 months, totaling 12.5 hours under anesthesia. Plus chemo! No wonder I can't remember a damn thing!

And also glad you can get your port out. My MO had originally wanted me to keep mine 6-12 months, but my feeling is that if there isn't an immediate need, I want it gone. I don't want to live as if I'm waiting for more treatment. I actually was going through my closet today and off-loading somethings I don't like all that much. I am planning to do some serious simplifying over the coming year. You have an amazing attitude and I am so impressed with your commitment to healthy living. BeingPositive - I don't know about RBC, but my MO had told me to wait until four weeks after chemo to have my ankle surgery done. (I waited 27 days - seems close enough). They didn't even do more bloodwork on me, just used the labs from the last chemo. I went for my first long walk post ankle surgery. My foot is still partially numb but the scar is thoroughly healed and I'm ready to be active again. I'm getting ready to make a big pot of seafood stew and visit with my younger son.",

My labs came back good - liver enzymes okay and cholesterol has actually dropped significantly from 218 last January to 166 now. I am guessing having switched to a mostly plant-based diet is largely responsible for that change. When the oncologist came in, I saw he'd grown a beard and he said, \"You've grown some hair!\" and I replied, \"So have you!\" I'm going topless all the time these days, even at work.
