I was sent for a sonogram, given a Bi-Rads score of 4 (suspicious abnormality), then sent to a breast specialist who told me to get a new sonogram in 6 months. So I thought, wow it must not be a big deal. However the lump doubled in size over the course of those 6 months and I started to get worried. When I went for my 2nd sonogram they actually asked the radiologist to come in and \"speak to me\" which they hadn't done before. Turns out I had 2 lumps now, and the original lump was indeed much bigger. The radiologist told me I had to see my breast specialist right away and get this all taken care of. I saw him, scheduled an open excisional biopsy, and had the original lump removed within 2 weeks.  I was very nervous because I kept thinking \"I'm too young for all of this\" but really age is on your side when it comes to breast changes. It is pretty uncommon for breast cancer to develop at your age without a family history at least. After all my worries my lump turned out to be a benign fibroadenoma. The other lump is most likely the same thing and I will continue to monitor it for growth. I'm not saying that you shouldn't be concerned because obviously you never know until you get your results but try not to be too worried about it until then. No matter what they tell you or how nervous all the terminology makes you feel, save the worry for later.  Also, I too had some random pains near my underarms here and there and had pain whenever I got a breast exam and they pushed too hard on the area near the lump. I have pretty noticable veins in that breast and I get soreness during my period sometimes. Apparently all of these symptoms I have are normal. Good luck with your sonogram!",
