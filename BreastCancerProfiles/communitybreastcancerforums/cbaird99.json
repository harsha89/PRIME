I have been reading about this thing called cording and I definitely have it, have been wondering what it was. I will get a referral to a LE therapist so I can learn how to get rid of that. I get the results of my onco dx test next Tuesday so that will determine the next step I guess, hopefully it will be low:)",

About a week after the surgery, I developed a seroma at the armpit incision site. I have had it drained twice so far, 350cc the first time and 70 cc today. Is this lymphedema, or does it make it more likely that I will get it? I am also concerned that radiation will make the drainage situation worse, not sure if I can prevent that or reduce likelihood. I am also going nuts as I am used to exercising 6 days a week and am having to hold off on it for now. Any input?
