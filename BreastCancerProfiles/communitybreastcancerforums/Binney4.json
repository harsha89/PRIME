Keep a close eye on that irritation, check for the signs of infection, and get help immediately if you suspect it might be an early indication of cellulitis. Keep us posted! Hugs, Binney",

For those using cornstarch, you can dump some into the toe of a clean cotton sock, close the top with a rubber band, and pat it on just where you want it. Keeps it from puffing all over and from spilling on the floor, where it's awfully slippery. If you're using any of the solid crystal products, do be watchful for sharp edges from dropping it or banging it on something. It can chip off and leave really sharp places, which are a risk for nasty little nicks -- something you want to avoid even after rads because of the lymphedema risk. If you chip it, you may be able to smooth it again with pumice. Otherwise, toss it and get a new one. Be well! Binney ",

It's always a good idea to hook up with a well-trained lymphedema therapist BEFORE surgery, for baseline arm measurements, personalized tips on reducing your lymphedema risk, and to learn a gentle self-massage for reducing swelling. And to help determine what's up with the swelling! If this is your left arm that's swelling, and your port is on the left side, then it's possible the port is pressing against the main lymphatic vessel and reducing lymph flow to that area. It is rare, and can affect both legs as well, since that vessel drains the left arm and the legs. If so, it will resolve when the port is removed. Lymphedema is also possible when cancer blocks lymph flow, but since you are being treated for that, we'll look forward with you to that resolving as well. As buttons points out, chemo itself can sometimes cause swelling, but that is not usually restricted to one arm only. Best bet is to get any doctor on your team to refer you to a qualified lymphedema therapist. In the meantime, we're all rooting for your smooth sailing through the rest of your treatment. Please let us know what you discover, and tell us how we can help! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Isn't it funny that nurses aren't routinely taught to do this? I have mine done on my calf. You have to be lying flat for at least five minutes before they do it to assure an accurate reading. Even so, it'll be higher than an arm bp, so you need to have them do it in a consistent way every time so you can get an idea of relative bp. The paramedics at my fire department know how to do this and will do it for free when they have time -- maybe yours do to, and they can teach you so you can instruct the nurses (hmmmm -- what's wrong with this picture?!) And, hey! the paramedics are cute! My onc's nurses won't do leg bp lying down, I guess because it takes so much time. So I don't let them do it at all -- what's the point of writing down nonsense in my medical record? Sheila, thanks for the article. We do need to disregard the next-to-last line, though: \"For those patients who have had a mastectomy without lymph node dissection (ie, prophylactic mastectomy), blood pressure can be obtained in either arm.\" That's a no-no! Prophylactic mastectomy is a risk for LE, so don't do it! Hmmm. Can you tell I got LE in one of my arms from a blood pressure cuff?! Be well! Binney",

At present there's no way to do that without the collateral damage, unfortunately. But even rads to the axilla doesn't guarantee LE. And refusing the rads doesn't give you a LE pass either. So the decision is not, \"Should I treat the cancer and get LE, or not treat the cancer at all.\" It's \"Should I risk not killing off the cancer that has the potential to kill me, or should I do everything I can and gamble on a less-than-50% chance of LE?\" If you add to that equation that you can see a LE specialist right away for baseline measurements and risk-reduction education, and follow a few simple guidelines for using the arm, you have an excellent chance of avoiding it all together, or keeping it easy-to-manage if you should develop it. Consideriing that any surgery puts us at risk already, it's only a matter of degree anyway. Just another way of thinking about it. Be well! Binney",

If your insurance limits you to one set at a time you could try appealing, because most insurance companies will consider two sets of garments necessary so you can wash one and wear the other. Do you have a glove (or gauntlet) that you wear with the sleeve? If not, that's something else to consider. Here's the reasoning on that, from Dr. Andrea Cheville, one of our leading LE doctors: http://lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gauntletandsleeve/ With my insurance I get two sets of garments every six months, but for me they're actually wearable for around nine months, so I have some carry-over that allows me to do the stupid laundry a little less often.

I've done the shower thing, arm straight up in the air, trying to wash one-handed. Definitely an athletic event! You did great with the dishes and dinner -- good for you! Listen, wrapping it yourself can be pretty frustrating, so sit down somewhere where the stupid bandages can't roll away from you (I use the center of my bed), allow yourself plenty of time, and crank up your sense of humor. It really does get easier, but right at first it can bring you to your knees. But it truly is possible, and you can do this! The therapist did the Manual Lymph Drainage massage, yes? And she'll be seeing you regularly for awhile? The standard course of therapy to bring the swelling completely down (or as down as it'll go for now) and encourage your lymph system to develop some alternate routes is at least a couple of weeks, and during that time you wrap all the time (except when showering and applying lotion).  THEN you get fitted for the sleeve and glove when the swelling is all reduced. The sleeve and glove can only maintain loss, they won't help you reduce it. It's the therapy and wrapping both that will reduce the swelling. Does that make sense? I will sure be thinking of you tomorrow, shower and rads and wrapping and all. Hang in there, tomatojuice! Big hugs, and chocolate wishes, Binney",

You need to protect yourself from sunburn, and if the surf is rough you have to be careful not to get your arm skinned while body surfing. But aside from that, the water's good for LE. Stand about chest deep and move your arms around in the water, swim a bit (any stroke except maybe butterfly). Breast stroke is especially nice.  The only real contraindication would be if you've recently had cellulitis, or if you're subject to repeat bouts of it. Then you want to be super careful about the cleanliness of whatever body of water you're swimming in.  Of course, like everything else with LE, we need to plan ahead. Be sure to take along your usual antiseptic wipes and bandaids in case of cuts or scrapes, sun protection, and lotion to use after rinsing off from your swim. Then don your garments whenever you're going to be out of the water for awhile. Are you planning a beach get-away? Enjoy! Binney",

This wasn't a study to find out if weight training helped leg LE, but to find out if people with leg LE from cancer surgery (prostate, gynecologic, melanoma all come to mind as possibilities for leg LE) could be expected to follow through on the weight-training protocols for the full five months. They found out they COULD follow through, but also noted that there was a surprising rate of cellulitis and that the exercise didn't help the swelling or improve their quality of life. This is in contrast to this researcher's previous (widely trumpeted) study which showed that under some restricted circumstances women with arm LE from bc treatment who did supervised weight-training didn't have a lot of trouble with infections, and by their own report their quality of life improved.  So, what's the difference? Really an interesting question. Since the sample was so small the rate of cellulitis may be just a quirk, but it's surprising to me that this intervention didn't improve their quality of life like it did for the women with bc-related LE. When I read Dr. Schmitz's initial study with bc-LE patients I assumed the quality of life boost had to do with these women getting so much positive attention and encouragement for their LE, which is otherwise so off the medical radar. Yet the patients with other kinds of cancers and LE didn't seem to get that boost from being part of the study. Their legs did get stronger, which is no surprise. But that alone didn't improve their outlook. Odd, yes? Binney",

The point of reducing the swelling through therapy is not cosmetic (though that sure helps!), but to lower your risk of infection. Lymph fluid is warm and protein-rich, so when it sits stagnant in our tissues it's like an incubator for bacteria. A well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist will be able to get the lymph flowing out of the area, and teach you to keep it that way. After that you can cautiously consider (with your doctor's help) how you can work toward getting off the antibiotics. On the other hand, those of us with lymphedema do run a life-long risk of infection from even tiny skin cracks. So vigilance (and a prescription of antibiotics to have on hand) will always be needed. But proper self Manual Lymph Drainage massage, excellent skin care, and gentle exercise should help you improve your outcome considerably.

And in France, are there controls on how much of a supplement is actually in the OTC product? We seem to have a problem with that here. (Actually, there's also a problem here with the word pycnogenol, which usually refers to the ingredient you mention in both grape seed extract and the French pine bark extract, but with a capital, to a specific product name which apparently contains neither of those. But I think we have a problem with drug names across the board...) By the way, on a recent trip to our desert arboretum I learned that the outer skin of the ocotillo plant, which is a particularly imposing cactus with hugh, wicked spines covering every inch of its length, was used in times past to \"stimulate the lymphatics.\" Just the thought of trying to harvest it certainly stimulated mine!

You must be so discouraged with the swelling -- and that pain is no fun either! If your sleeve is causing indents in your arm you'd be better off not wearing it until you can get some therapy for your hand and arm. Indents indicate that it's too tight now, and that'll just make the swelling worse. Until you can get help, try elevating your arm as much as possible (on the back of the couch or car seat during the day, on a pillow at night). Instead of the too-tight compression sleeve, try a long-sleeved tight sport-shirt (like bike racers wear, y'know - some are called something like Body Armor) or a leo, in a size smaller than you'd normally wear. Wear it inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin. It won't reduce the swelling, but it might keep it from progressing for now. Drink plenty of water, and avoid heat (hot tub, hot shower, dish water ). Because the stagnent lymph fluid is warm and protein-rich, bacteria love it. So use a good lotion to keep your skin from cracking and be extra careful to avoid injuring your hand or arm. You don't mention a glove, but once you have some therapy and get your swelling back in control do make sure you get a compression glove as well as sleeve, and wear them together to avoid more hand swelling. My therapist saw me four days a week for five weeks, but some women don't take that long to get their LE back in control, so it depends. Each time I saw her she did complete Manual Lymph Drainage massage and wrapped my hand and arm. Sally, I hear you on not being able to work wrapped, and I agree it's a real bear. But unfortunately wrapping is the route to regaining control. Are there accomodations you and your employer can make to keep you productively engaged while you complete the Therapy Intensive that you need? Doing it now will definitely save you considerable grief down the road, including those rotten hospital stays for IV antibiotics when everything's out of control. So please do see if there's some way to make room in your life to take good care of you -- you're worth every minute of it! Okay, I agree with Bobbie that a 60-mile trip is a bad idea. But I absolutely believe you need a well-trained LE therapist to help you get this down as quickly as possible, give you the skills and resources you need to keep it that way, and be available to you for occasional re-measuring and consults. So I hopped on over to the Therapist Locator (www.mylymphedema.com, then click on the Therapist Locator) and looked at just one of the links (for Klose School) and they have 52 LE therapists listed in Indiana. Maybe one is nearer than 60 miles to you. Vodder School, which I was also able to check for Indiana as a whole, has only three therapists in the state, but maybe one of those might be near you as well. There are two other therapist schools listed on that site that ask you to enter your zip code and they email you a list of their fully-qualified therapists in your area, so try those too and see what you come up with, and what your insurance will cover. Please take care of yourself, Sally -- this LE stuff is rotten, and you just can't let it get the best of you. Get a therapist you can team up with and you'll soon have your life back. Be well! Binney  Okay, Bobbie, how'd I do?  ",

Here's what LindaLou said: Just a few comments up front to be clear. LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted.  Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however... Treating lymphedema at the earliest stage (even before any of these indications can be seen) greatly improves the outcome and future management. Do request a referral for evaluation by a well-qualified lymphedema therapist at the earliest indication of heaviness, fullness, aching, or just plain feeling \"funny.\" Be well! Binney",

If you're not familiar with them, use the links at the bottom of this StepUp-SpeakOut page to see what's out there: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Keep us posted on your progress!

If the doctors have cleared you to begin lymphedema therapy, that would be a good next step. Treating lymphedema promptly can mean an easier time controling it, and that's a very good thing. Since it appears that you have some lymphedema in your arm, wearing a well-fitted sleeve and glove or gauntlet (fingerless glove) would be important. If you're also experiencing chest lymphedema you'll also want to consider some kind of chest compression. Here's information about chest/breast lymphedema (it's called truncal lymphedema).

The point of lymphedema therapy is to return our arms to usable condition and teach us how to keep them that way. While waiting for treatment, though, I found it easy to avoid over-using my right arm, because I was so worried about it. You can certainly use it, even while waiting -- just be careful about straining it. Most of us are careless of simple body mechanics, like holding heavier loads with both hands and keeping them close to our bodies instead of extended outward where they strain our arms more. So just being thoughtful about those things is usually enough to get you through until you can find your way to a good lymphedema therapist. If you're doing something that is repetitive (knitting, say) just plan to take a break now and then and do something else for a while, then return to it later. If in the long term you find you need to modify your right-arm use, there are loads of simple and effective ways to do that, but for now it shouldn't be an issue. And hopefully never! Hugs, Binney",

Do please keep a very close watch for any signs of infection: warmth to the touch, redness, increased pain or swelling, or a temp. (If there's redness, circle the area with a permanent marker so any progression can be followed.) If any of those symptoms start, go right away to critical care or the ER and be sure to tell them about the lymphedema, and that you suspect cellulitis. Sherry, I'm sure your onc's office and his PA are excellent at what the do, but most onc's don't \"do\" lymphedema. The suggestion that you be fitted for a sleeve and see what happens is completely backwards. Especially if there may be infection brewing, a sleeve is not a good thing. Also, I can see where the doc might want to rule out other causes for your symptoms, but those other causes (blood clot, for instance) should NOT wait two weeks to be investigated.  On a strictly practical level, if you need lymphedema therapy, then the sleeve you order on Tuesday will no longer fit once any swelling is reversed.  But even more to the point, if what you're dealing with is, in fact, lymphedema, then the quicker you get help with it the better your outcome, the lower your risk for serious systemic infection, and the easier it is to control over time. My suggestion would be first, that you go directly for emergency help at any further sign of infection. DON'T WAIT!!! And second, if your arm is stable, on Tuesday skip the fitting and find a doctor on your team who will move forward with helping you get the proper treatment. But that's JMHO. Here's a page with information about cellulitis: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm Please keep us posted, Sherry. Gentle hugs, Binney",

Mine considers it Durable Medical Equipment and covers it the same as crutches and such. But here's the problem: they will only cover so many a year (commonly, since they need to be replaced every six months at least, they'll cover one or two changes every six months). If you go out and get a sleeve and glove now, then go into lymphedema therapy, the garments won't fit after the swelling has been reduced, and your insurance won't necessarily pay for more until the six months are up. The medical professionals who evaluate and treat lymphedema are well-trained lymphedema therapists. It's their specialty. Here's information about how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm The process of lymphedema treatment is to reduce the swelling first through an intensive phase of therapy that includes Manual Lymph Drainage massage, wrapping with layered short-stretch bandages, specific exercises, and careful skin care. When the swelling is reduced to normal or plateaus, then you're fitted for garments to maintain the reduction (garments will not reduce the swelling, only maintain the loss, so wearing them now will not solve the underlying problem). Most of us need to continue to wrap our arms at night or wear special night garments that are designed to maintain reduction or even help reduce it while you're not moving around or exercising. This whole thing is very confusing to all of us, Sherry. It's a very steep learning curve that is not helped by the fact that doctors and nurses are not generally well-informed about diagnosis or treatment. I am not a medical professional and certainly wouldn't urge you to ignore your doctors and PA, but you sure might try a dialogue with them about getting a prompt evaluation from a lymphedema therapist.

In the meantime, elevating your affected arm will help -- on the back of the couch while watching TV, on pillows at night, and whenever else you can. Drink PLENTY of water (it helps dilute the lymph fluid) and pause from time to time to take deep abdominal breaths (it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies). A light sports bra or cami that comes up high in the axilla might help provide some comfort and support without adding too much compression. A Maidenform Control It cami, for instance. I take it your doctor is treating the thrombosis, yes? Until s/he gives you the green light to go ahead with lymphedema therapy, do try to take it easy and not overdo with activity, lifting or exercise, as that can make the swelling worse. Avoid hot showers or baths, as heat can cause swelling as well. Treat any nicks, scratches, burns, cuts, insect bites or hangnails with topical antibiotics promptly, and keep your skin well moisturized with a low-PH lotion (Eucerin or Vanicream, for instance).

My doctors took a \"wait-and-see\" approach instead of sending me for prompt treatment.

Far from reducing my truncal lymphedema, she was responsible for it's spreading to my right arm and hand. Still without adequate help, it eventually developed in my left hand and arm as well. Recent research shows that prompt treatment can prevent progression (not to mention reducing the risk of serious infection). I wish I had known that, because if it had not progressed I would not have lost the ability to type and crochet with my right hand. Yours does NOT need to get to that point. Get GOOD help SOON.

They normally see patients whose lymphedema is problematical for one reason or another. Evaluation and treatment of lymphedema is normally done by well-qualified lymphedema therapists, not by doctors who specialize in conditions of the lymph system. There's a project going forward in the U.S. (and separately in Canada) called the Lymphedema Framework Project that intends to draw together specialists in many medical fields to determine protocols for the best treatment of lymphedema and other lymphatic disorders. Perhaps once that happens a specialty in Lymphology will be recognized here, but currently doctors interested in lymphedema specialize in other fields.  Be well, Binney",

If you already have it, then wrapping with your short-stretch bandages is recommended. If you're trying to prevent it you can stay REALLY well hydrated, do some gentle arm stretches at intervals, do some deep abdominal breathing at intervals, and if you wear a sleeve be sure to wear some hand protection as well, either a glove or gauntlet (fingerless glove). Also, compression garments should be well fitted. Be careful about lugging suitcases or jerking them off the carousels or out of the overhead bins. I have never heard that blood clots are more common with lymphedema, though they are more common with some of our breast cancer treatments. Bon voyage! Binney",

My experience is that most nurses get into the business because they want to make things better, not worse, but they aren't well taught about LE. So if their patients (us) don't tell them what's up, they're not likely to know. We really can help the bc Sisters who come along behind us if we're willing to gently help our health professionals learn the realities. Just a thought. Any ideas, you ask? The first one that comes to mind is decking the therapist for her tree-trunk comment. Oops, sorry! Don't know how that managed to slip out! Seriously, though, I am wondering about your therapist's qualifications. Do you know if she's had the requisite 135 hours of specifically LE training from a reputable institution? Does she have at least a year's experience treating LE? And, well hey, even if she does, she sure didn't follow treatment protocol for your LE in the first place. Here's the National Lymphedema Network web site, where you can find and copy their Position Papers on Therapist training and on Therapy: www.lymphnet.org. If you like and trust this therapist (or conversely, if she's the only one within a hundred-mile radius so you're stuck with her), you can take the Therapy paper in with you and tell her you'd like her to follow that protocol. Because short of that you're going to continue to have trouble. The machine you're describing sounds like a pump, which some therapists use in conjunction with their own hands-on massage and wrapping of your entire hand and arm. (Other therapists use it INSTEAD OF hands-on massage, but that's not okay). The blockage causing your hand to swell was caused at your axilla, so even if your arm does not appear to be swelling yet, it's not just your hand that is struggling here. The entire arm needs to be treated. In fact, where the massage is concerned, your entire neck, chest, and back need to treated. Okay, one other thought (are you still with me? I do tend to run on, sorry! ) The idea in treating LE is NOT just to get the swelling down so it's tolerable, but to get as much of the fluid out of your entire hand and arm as possible and to keep it that way. Stagnant lymph fluid invites serious systemic infection, and it also continues to do internal damage that may eventually reduce hand and arm strength and range of motion. Obviously, the DoughBoy look is bad, but so is any fluid accumulation that has not been treated adequately. If your hand is still visibly bigger than the other hand, you need and deserve complete LE therapy. And besides having the therapist massage and wrap you daily for a couple of weeks or however long it takes, you should also be taught self-massage and how to wrap your own arm (the wrapping, by the way, is what you'll use at night after all the swelling is gone, to help keep it that way.) Those are your tools, and you need them. Hmmm. Guess that hit a nerve. Can't help it -- I had a short-cut therapist myself at first. I didn't know any better, of course. And she did a lot of damage. So be it. But I don't like to see it happen to anyone else. Harley, get good help -- you're worth it! Binney ",

In this story you'll note that she gives specific warnings: It is recommended that women start with a slowly progressive program, supervised by a certified fitness professional, in order to learn how to do these types of exercises properly. Women with lymphedema should also wear a well-fitting compression garment during all exercise sessions. We might reasonably ask who's got that sort of LE-savvy supervision available. But aside from that, the real problem here is that this is a \"myth-buster\" study, and the tendency with myth-busting is to go way overboard. The myth in this case involves the fact that for many years the standard medical recommendation was to NOT exercise the arm at all and to not lift anything more than five pounds. There are still doctors telling some women that routinely, even though it's been known for years that muscle movement is the primary lymphatic pump. I've been both looking forward to Schmidt's results and dreading them, because the PR is bound to be all about \"get out there and lift those weights!\" and not about knowledgeable supervision, slow progression, and well-fitted garments. So I'm afraid you're right -- the next wave of serious LE misinformation will be about dashing out to the gym and going for the gusto. When really it's all about doing what's right for YOU. Hopefully a reasonable balance will soon prevail. Good topic, Doe. Thanks for bringing it up. Be well! Binney",

Just got my new garments today and, though they all fit really well (took me a loooong time to find the company and measurements that work best for me, but now we've got it down to a science--whew!) I still find compression garments disgusting! My fitter (who is a darling) came dancing into the fitting room with all my stuff today and said, \"New garments -- exciting and suspence-filled!\" True, but also utterly unwanted! Don't wear the darn thing anymore, and tomorrow take it back and kindly-but-firmly demand a fix. We need compression; we don't need pain and aggravation. It's their job to get it right or eat it.  On the other hand, do I remember correctly that yours are coming from Germany and it takes them weeks to swim here? If so, consider ordering from a closer company -- say, Gottfried, which gets them to you within a week or two and if they're not right manages to fix them. Nice people to work with, professional. On the other hand, if the bigger size works, that'd be great news. The point is, it takes a couple of days (at least) to tell if new garments are going to work or not, so even a glance in the mirror isn't enough to assure you of a good fit (although that sure does seem like a basic start!) Next time, only wear new garments an hour or two before removing them. If all's well, move up to three hours the next time. Then maybe six. But DO NOT wear them for a whole day straight right off the bat, for reasons you now understand all too clearly.  :-(   Night garment sizes don't necessarily coordinate with day garment sizes, sadly enough. At all. But night garments are a different sort of compression altogether and are less likely to cause you grief (just my experience!)  Still, best to wear them for a few hours in the evening the first day, working up to a whole night with them. And of course you also have to work out any possible skin reaction issues too, so go real easy. There are night garments that are adjustable -- Circaid is a nice one. You might want to look into that, since it gives you the freedom to adjust and readjust as needed.  I'm so sorry that this is such an ordeal. Trial by compression! It DOES get better with time and experience. Hang in there! Hugs, Binney",

They're reasonably comfortable and last about two years. I'm not sure a tank would be real comfortable. Mine tend to end up wrapped around my waist even during the day, so I don't know how well they'd stay in place at night. On the other hand, if by \"compression tank\" you mean something like an Underarmor tank top, that probably wouldn't shift and bind as you flop around in your sleep. But how you'd keep Swell Spots in place with a tank I don't know. JoviPak has a couple of new \"swell spots\" that are for armpit swelling. One of them might work for you, but again, I don't know how you'd keep it in place. Did they say anything about that? Maybe ask about ordering night garments -- a sleeve/glove and vest. Anyplace you'd get lymphedema garments from would have to be a \"specialty store,\" but if this one can't fit you for a night garment to address your needs, you need to find one that can.

I think what has alarmed me the most is my recent discovery that there is no requirement on the part of the surgeons doing these surgeries to demonstrate either the effectiveness or safety of the procedures, and there's no one looking for the long-term complications, much less making them known. It's all based on an agreement between patient and surgeon, so when I see doctors advertising it sure makes me worry about the protections that are not in place to assure full disclosure of the risks and potential. There are not even any standards regarding who is most likely to benefit from the surgeries and who might be most likely to be further damaged by it. It's all up to each individual surgeon to decide for himself--based on no research and sketchy lymphatic science (and let's face it--a hefty surgery fee). I'd like to think the women undergoing these surgeries are brave pioneers making a cure possible for all of us, but without the research backing up the work, it's a lot more about their vulnerability than anything else.  FIRST transparency and full disclosure, not to mention actual on-going research of a high quality. THEN we can talk about who are the brave ones willing to give it a try. As it is, we're all at risk, hoping against hope for relief and a cure, and being offered ads instead of studies.  WE NEED TO STAND UP TOGETHER AND SHOUT WITH ONE VOICE FOR RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH AND REPORTING!!!

      "Content": "Oct 10, 2009 11:41AM - edited Oct 10, 2009 11:47AM by Binney4 Oooh, Virginia, great question! This is a favorite subject of mine, because I believe we bc Sisters are in a position to bring awareness not only to our bc-related lymphedema, but to those with other forms of lymphedema as well -- all of whom have an even harder time than we do getting diagnosis and treatment. As Otter explained, there's \"Primary lymphedema,\" which can be either hereditary (which means the genes that control it are passed down from generation to generation -- it's usually present at birth or develops in early childhood), or congenital (which means some damage occurs to the lymph system in utero -- it commonly shows up either at puberty or in middle age). Hereditary LE is of course very hard on moms and dads, who have to massage, wrap, and struggle garments onto busy little bodies -- and the little ones have to go without garments for periods of time throughout the day or their sensory systems fail to develop properly. Congenital LE that shows up at puberty can do tremendous emotional damage, especially because it's rarely diagnosed properly and young teens are told they need to diet because they're \"fat.\" Many, many people with congenital LE go for a decade or more without a proper diagnosis, during which time they can develop incredible fibrosis, infections, and skin that weeps caustic lymph fluid. Growing up in this manner wreaks havoc, to say the least. Our own brand of LE is Secondary, which as Otter points out is \"secondary\" to other causes. It includes the largest group of lymphers in the world -- those infected with filariasis. They are generally in developing (tropical) countries and have limited medical resources, so they become completely disabled by their disease, unable to work at their subsistence-level jobs. The result is, of course, devastating -- their circumstances make our LE look like a romp in the park. A 2008 study of Dominican women with this brand of LE has a title that tells it all: \"Can It Be That God Does Not Remember Me?\": A Qualitative Study on the Psychological Distress, Suffering and Coping of Dominican Women With Chronic Filarial Lymphedema. Other causes of Secondary LE include LE from trauma (auto accidents, orthopedic surgeries, contact sports, etc.) and other kinds of cancer surgeries: melanoma, head and neck cancers, prostate cancer, and all the gynecologic cancers. These folks have a MUCH harder time getting a diagnosis than we do, since the medical community is even more dismissive of their risk than of ours. All of this just to say that WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE for EVERY form of lymphedema if we are willing to keep these others in mind as we advocate for our own needs. There's another thread here about the Women's Health & Cancer Treatment Act that forces insurance to help out those of us treated for bc. Our sisters with ovarian cancer have no such protection, and primary lymphers have even less than that. Nearly all the LE research being done concerns upper extremity LE in women treated for bc, leaving the moms and dads of the wee ones with little or no new information to help them cope. Even the study we've been discussing here has no application at all to any other lymphers than those of us with bc. Believe it or not, we're the lucky ones. So...that was my rallying cry. We've got our work cut out for us, Binney",

Just guessing, but I'd say it's not a problem, since I know some therapists who use very wide ACE bandages for the chest/breast. In fact some of the LE supply places sell them for that purpose. You don't want to put something like that around your arm because it interferes with the lymph pathways out of your hand and arm. But your chest is another matter because the lymph can go up to the neck and axilla nodes, or down toward the groin. JMHO, anyway. To be safe, do pay attention to any irritation in the axilla area, and any tingling or heaviness in your arm. Well, and of course any swelling in your arm or hand. Let your PS know at once if you have problems like that. But otherwise I'd say it's worth it to get the benefits you're hoping for from it. Keep us posted and let us know how it works out.

Which part(s) of Complete Decongestive Therapy are essential and which may not be? How can we predict who's most likely to develop lymphedema following bc treatment and who isn't? Why didn't Pitanga develop lymphedema with 22 nodes removed, and why did I with only one node removed? Why do some of us have more trouble than others controlling their lymphedema? The list of urgent questions is endless (and the research is still in its infancy!) But the issue here is Susan Love's \"analysis\" of Schmitz's study. Perhaps the fact that she is not in practice explains why she doesn't realize that the number of weight trainers in this country who know anything about lymphedema is far less than even the number of qualified lymphedema therapists. She suggests we can go to our YMCA and get help like that the women in the study received, but that's ludicrous. In the real world, even finding an adequate lymphedema therapist is often a real trick. But how many patients know that? And for that matter, how many doctors know that? There are a number of other such \"unrealities\" in Schmitz's study, but that doesn't diminish the lovely news that for some women with lymphedema, and given expert garment-fitting and oversight, weightlifting may not be any more hazardous to their condition than not weightlifting, and it'll for sure make them stronger. My question for nsykes, though, is, if Dr. Love is so receptive and responsive and available, how come she hasn't answered my email to the address posted? It was not angry or argumentative, and it offered both a question and a suggestion for tracking down the information she's missing from professionals in the lymphedema field. Of course Dr. Love is busy, but then, so am I. And I consider that the cavalier manner in which Dr. Love's article encouraged women to question current risk reduction precautions (based on zero research) is going to cause some women to develop or exacerbate lymphedema. If that happens to even one, it's one too many. That is not a small thing. The article needs to be removed promptly, period. Then again, that assumes that women are listening to Dr. Love, and perhaps they aren't. In this case, that's a good thing. Lisa-e, are you familiar with the Lymphatic Research Foundation? Excellent organization, lots going on. They're here: http://lymphaticresearch.org If you visit their site you can sign up for their newsletter, which is helpful for keeping up with progress in finding some of the answers we need. And Lisa/Pitanga, there is some very interesting research being done in the UK by Stanton, et. al. that suggests there are some physiologic considerations that may lead to one woman developing lymphedema while another does not. If we knew that, and if we could then develop a pre-test to determine which of us are physiologically prone to lymphedema, there might be a better basis for suggesting targeted risk reduction practices. That's one study direction I'm really anxious to see developed. Until then, though, risk reduction has to be generalized to everyone who's potentially at risk, and naturally there will be some for whom it's overkill. As for your flying, garments MUST be well-fitted, and anyone who wears a sleeve should also have a hand garment (for the reason you explained). Again, in the real world, finding a garment fitter who knows how to fit sleeves and gloves properly is often a real dilemma.  I am so very sorry about the mets, and especially that the research to guarantee a cure for that is still to be done. That's certainly on a whole 'nother scale of importance! Be well, Lisa! Hugs all around -- you too, nsykes. Do please carry our message to Dr. Love -- we'd be gratified if she'd take seriously the experience of those of us who deal with this condition. Thanks! Binney",

But I am worried about the many women who are looking for a reason NOT to worry about their risk, and who will believe Susan Love is an expert on lymphedema. If you're in a position to influence people concerning their own health, then you owe it to all of them to be extremely careful what you say, and even what you imply. She and nsykes both have now heard from us that we're unhappy with the way she is using her influence to endanger our Sisters, so hopefully she'll take the message to heart. Fortunately we'll know that when we see some careful revisions to her article. The emphasis should rightly be on the need for further research, but in the meantime the meaning -- and the limitations -- of the air travel and weight-lifting studies should be crystal clear and not muddied with unfounded speculations. I'm really hopeful on this one -- an influential former doctor taking up an informed and heartfelt cry for adequate LE research, based on a clear-eyed understanding of what the stakes are for all of us, would be a real encouragement. Hopefully she's entirely sincere about learning to be that person! Binney",

And to think we have Susan Love to thank for launching this discussion!  Happy29, I wanted to acknowledge your comments about the usefulness of Susan Love's book to you along your breast cancer journey. Your experience has certainly been shared by many, many women, and I don't think anyone here is discounting that. I'm really glad you found her book at the time you needed it. The issue here, though, is not whether Dr. Love is an acknowledged voice of breast cancer treatment and cure, but whether her opinions about lymphedema are responsibly expressed -- and the discussion has even moved on to the question of whether she has any real expertise in lymphology. Even if she were currently a practicing surgeon there's certainly no guarantee she would be a reliable resource regarding lymphedema, because it is definitely the abandoned step-child of oncology, cancer surgery, and the medical field in general. THAT, at least, has been shown to be the case by research conducted by Stanley Rockson at Stanford. So...no particular reflection on Dr. Love if she is not savvy about lymphedema. In fact she unfortunately has plenty of company! The rest of this discussion veers in a lot of different directions, much of it \"apples and oranges.\" Prevention is different from treating a diagnosed condition. Pre-clinical lymphedema is different from advanced lymphedema. Research-based evidence is different from anecdotal experience. Well-fitted garments are vastly different from poorly-fitted ones, just as short-stretch bandaging done by a well-trained therapist or patient is vastly different from any application of an ACE bandage to an arm either with lymphedema or at risk for it. And a careless statement by someone who is not likely to be listened to anyway is a whole lot less of a problem than the same statement when it's made by someone with influence in the breast cancer community. Whew! Anyhow, for what it's worth, all we currently have (or are likely to have in the next many years or forever) is the advise of experts in lymphology -- all of whom agree, by the way, that poorly-fitted garments are not a good thing for anyone. Beyond that THEY all agree exercise is good for people with lymphedema, and that it should be done very gradually and preferably with expert supervision. The only ones who don't agree with that are lymphedema-uninformed doctors who didn't learn it straight in med school and haven't looked into it since -- a category that sadly includes some of the best breast surgeons and oncologists, in some of our finest cancer treatment centers. That is not a matter of settling controversies, but of education of medical personnel -- a very different matter than encouraging women to ignore risk reduction practices. Dr. Love's rather cavalier treatment of the subject (and let's give her due credit for treating the subject at all!) illustrates some of the worst fears of those of us with lymphedema: a dismissal of our condition and its treatment by the doctors who are supposed to be overseeing our care. Few of us fit the criteria of the women in this study, so this cheerful news of \"myth-bashing\" truly does not apply to us. We will not ever be able to lift weights (or even our children/grandchildren) with impunity again. Kathryn Schmitz's study does nothing to change our reality, but it does have the potential to make our doctors even less understanding of our very real limitations. Love's article careens back and forth between ideas of prevention and of the possibility that for some women with lymphedema weight lifting may not be worse than not weight lifting. That is unfortunately typical of the broad generalizations OUR doctors are likely to draw about OUR lymphedema. This was not in any way a study about risk (that one is still to come). It's about one specific form of exercise for a very narrow range of women who already have lymphedema, and who are not in any form of cancer treatment at the time and are attended by expert therapists, trainers and garment fitters. It's good news, but it's sure not big news. Not nearly as big as Dr. Love implies, nor as big as so many women at risk for lymphedema would like to make it. In fact, it doesn't have a single thing to do with women at risk for lymphedema, and certainly not with blood pressure cuffs or IVs. Dr. Love's conjuction of those topics is truly unfortunate, and very probably, for some of us at least, dangerous. Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to make sure Happy29 was not slighted as the discussion rolled on. As your Sisters in this crazy bc diagnosis, Happy, we're really glad for this resource that strengthened your hand. Be well! Binney",

Hard to do when you're of on an adventure and concentrating on other things, so make it a priority. The difference between Debbie's kayaking and your white water trip is probably conditioning. And possibly jerking. A steady and well-practiced paddling is different from holding on for dear life and having your arm jerked. So two things: strengthen your arm as much as comfortably possible (no strain!), and use your unaffected arm in preference to your at-risk arm for hanging on. In any case don't use the at-risk arm alone at all. Traveling itself means lugging gear too, so be mindful of that arm and lift carefully. Other than that, go out there and make beautiful memories!

When you have new compression garments you wear them the first time no more than an hour, increasing the time gradually until you know how they affect you over time. Since you don't mention a glove or gauntlet (fingerless glove), I just wanted to comment also that wearing a sleeve without hand protection can cause any swelling to become trapped in the hand, where it's harder to deal with.

I've had problems with prostheses too because of lymphedema (LE), but it's chest LE and I couldn't find a bra I could wear over my chest compression vest. It sure is frustrating, especially after you've already gone to the trouble of being carefully fitted for a bra and prosthesis, and then...stupid LE! But I'm willing to bet there's a reasonable solution. Do you have a good and experienced bra/prosthesis fitter? There are styles out there that have very wide straps to help distribute the weight and keep it from cutting into your shoulder, and wide, supportive sides and bottom band to spread out the job of supporting and take some of the stress off the shoulder. These might also stay in place better, and perhaps make it possible for you to switch to a lighter-weight prosthesis (such as whipped silicone).  If you're going to go without your prosthesis all day at home you're still going to have the problem of counterbalancing the weight of the single breast. I had the same situation and developed shoulder and posture problems. I wish someone had warned me to see a PT for help with strengthening exercises to avoid those problems. It takes some hard work to be a single-breasted woman warrior! (I eventually had to have a second mastectomy because of repeated surgical biopsies, which at least solved the unbalance problem!) The Bellisse bra (www.bellisse.com) is made for breast/chest LE, but it might provide you with the support you need, and it doesn't shift. (However it does tend to mash the breasts together into a sort of \"uni-boob.\" Sigh!) Also, you could check out the Breast Free web site for other resource ideas (http://breastfree.org). Has your LE therapist suggested any solutions?  Please keep us posted. I sure hope you can find a quick and comfortable way to handle this. Hugs! Binney ",

So you want to plan as many ways as possible to stay cooler. Stay really well hydrated -- don't wait until you feel thirsty. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages, which tend to dehydrate. Consider using one of those cooling bandanas on your neck; keep your wrists cool by rubbing them with your cup of ice water. Wear a sun hat (or carry a pretty parasol); stay out of the direct sun; duck indoors to the AC often. Look for any outdoor fans or misters and stick close to them. Pay attention to how you're feeling and if necessary call it quits early. In some ways it's easier for those of us who already have lymphedema to make these judgements -- we've already dealt with the diagnosis after all, and we know how to get things back in control if we push it too far. We can also judge how much effort we're willing to make to do that, and what it's worth to us to have to spend a few days (or more) regaining control. But trying to avoid LE when you don't already have it is a one-shot deal, where if you push it too far you could go from no diagnosis to LE-for-life. So let me remind you that no matter what they do, MOST women who have been treated for breast cancer will never develop it. And that if you are unlucky enough to be one of those who do, we're here for you. Go, enjoy, be wise! Binney",

It's not just the infection risk (since after treatment there may be excess lymph fluid in the tissues even without visible swelling, and lymph fluid is very bacteria-friendly), but the fact that our bodies react to the insult of needles or other pain-producing trauma by sending lots of lymph fluid to the site -- which can overwhelm an already compromised lymph system. Other sites than that quadrant are safer, at least from the standpoint of lymphedema. Trust me, she doesn't want to deal with lymphedema. Be well, Binney",

So how about if we all pitch in with suggestions for: 1. this study she's proposing that will include LE development as an add-on What questions should she be asking? 2. the lymphedema section of her breast book. What do you wish you'd known about LE before you even started bc treatment? How did you get a diagnosis, find a therapist, get well-fitting garments? I have some thoughts about the study, starting with the fact that from her comments it appears she's considering LE development as an afterthought. Very little will be learned that way, even from a study on a million women. There are some built-in problems, like, how will LE be measured and quantified -- circumferencial measurements, volume measurement, water displacement, lymphoscintigrapry, perometry, bioimpedance, self-reporting? Who will diagnose it -- doctors (surgeons, oncs, rad oncs, PCPs) who have real training in LE, well-qualified LE therapists, the patients themselves? What about breast/chest (truncal) LE, which goes undiagnosed sometimes for years? Will they include measures of skin breakdown, infection rates, days of work lost, quality of life? And apparently this is not just a study of people with breast cancer, so what about lower extremity LE from prostate and gynecologic cancers, or from melanoma. Head and neck cancers? What about pre-clinical LE (which some LE experts are now beginning to believe describes every woman and man treated for breast cancer)? If they're looking at the effectiveness of various risk reduction techniques, how will they know how compliant the individuals are, who moved a whole case of books last weekend, or who developed arm swelling only after their 15th flight? If women are wearing arm protection for exercise or travel, are they protecting their hand as well? Who is judging the proper fit of the garments, or the proper use of them, or how heavy their suitcase was and how many times they jerked it off a luggage carousel? How much water they drank, how religious they were about keeping their arm exercised? How fit they were before the the LE, how much they weighed and how rapidly they gained weight? Whether any doctor on their team was even willing to diagnose it?  What other medical conditions they have, previous surgeries or trama to the area, the drugs they're currently taking, what their treatment plan was, how their surgeon went about the surgery, what they did (or did not do) with their arms (or legs) in the days and weeks immediately following surgery? Seroma and hematomy development, post-op infections, Axillary Web Syndrome? Any study that fails to take in all the suspected factors will only give us more of the self-experimentation that Lisa-e so rightly finds frustrating (not to mention the dangerous oversimplifications that have resulted even from Dr. Schmitz's much more focused study).   And as far as revising the book is concerned, I'd strongly encourage Dr. Love to attend the next National Lymphedema Network international conference for medical professionals, which is less than a year away. The opportunity to mingle with and learn from researchers and lymphologists from all over the world will provide her with the foundation she needs to write an accurate, up-to-date and safe section on LE. Other suggestions, gals? You're all a wealth of information on this very important subject, and a terrific resource for Dr. Love to draw on. Thanks, hugs, Binny ",

I too have gotten emails today telling me all will be well if I just go out and lift weights. Personally, I can't even begin to tell you how incredibly frustrating that is to me. As a person with lymphedema, I am already humiliated by the lack of understanding of well-meaning friends and relatives, and this interpretation -- which is certainly and without question what's coming across in the media -- is not making my life any more dignified. In fact, it's humiliating. But that's just me. The implications are actually much broader. Rockysmom has already hinted here at the possible job-related problems that this particular media blitz is likely to produce. If she can lift weights, then doggone it she should be pulling \"her share\" at work -- no more of that whimpering about what you can't lift! And how far will this misunderstanding of LE work limitations go? MANY women lose their careers with this diagnosis. Think musicians whose arms swell when they play their violin. Artists who can no longer build clay pottery. Nurses who can't wear their gloves at work in sterile conditions. Women who do fine motor tasks not possible with compression gloves. And on and on. These women often need to apply for disability, which is ALWAYS a battle with LE because nobody's ever heard of it, or they think it's \"just a fat arm.\" How will this perception affect their disability applications and appeals? If you can lift weights with impunity then, woman, you're not disabled! Then there are the surgeons and oncologists and PCPs. They've \"known\" all along that we swell gals are making a mountain out of a molehill, and now they have \"proof.\" Just get out there and quit being a couch potato and your LE problems will disappear! Or they've pooh-poohed our insistence on taking precautions with our arms and rolled their eyes when we try to tell them all our bc Sisters need LE education for risk reduction. What the articles are saying is that, just like past major medical misunderstandings, risk reduction for LE is senseless. If we get out there and lift those puppies we'll all feel lots better and quit our fussing. I've been cruising the bc boards today, and I'm truly shaken by what I'm seeing. One woman says she's not sure how to start exercising again after bc surgery because she's afraid of LE, and another responds that she just read today that if you lift weights you won't get LE, so just go ahead to the gym and get your life back. That kind of post is popping up all over the web. There is no sense in my pointing out that the article refers to women with \"stable LE\" (whatever that may be) wearing expertly fitted compression garments and being supervised by a fleet of fully trained LE therapists and several of the few trainers in the country who have been made aware of LE, because doggone if they didn't read it in the news that weight training will keep them from getting LE. MOTC, none of that is what the study was supposed to be about. But all of that is what is happening already because of it. All of us already knew we could exercise, using careful attention to our arms, help from a LE therapist, compression of one kind or another. So this study has \"liberated\" no one. What it's done is expose many more women to the nasty surprise of new LE because they were once again misinformed about their risk. It's made our fight to get safe medical care far harder than it already was. And it's set our advocacy efforts for disability coverage back at a time when we sure as heck didn't need any more barriers. I have to add that what Linda said a few posts up is SOOOO true. To be accurate and careful the reporting should add that women with LE feel a whole lot better when someone is taking the time to encourage, direct and talk to them, to check up on them when they don't show up or follow through, to simply acknowledge that, indeed, they do have a serious chronic condition that is sapping the life out of them and that no one -- friends, relatives, employers, doctors -- is even acknowledging. At the NLN conference last year there were several researchers who commented on the effect Linda mentions -- that when this unacknowledged and unsupported LE population experiences the support and sense of recognition that a LE study involves, that alone positively influences their perceptions of their symptoms and their quality of life. The full study does not list that as one of the possible problems with their study outcome, but it's obvious to anyone who has felt the sense of abandonment that LE creates in us. So, yeah there's a kernel, at least, of good news in here. But it's very small, and it's not even new since we all knew it anyway. What concerns me is the bc Sisters who are being misled, and the life-long consequences for them -- and the sense that even the researchers, in their eagerness to be seen as liberating myth-busters, are throwing us under the bus. I hope that helps, MOTC. Basically we all need to understand the issues here, because our job of increasing accurate LE awareness and educating new bc patients about their choices for risk reduction practices just got a little bit harder.

Gotta find a way to get the word out to them! But, hey, MOTC! The good news is there IS some research in process regarding prevention. Mostly they're looking at prevention by educating patients early -- in other words, essentially risk reduction once the damage has been done. What we need is for surgeons and rads oncs to begin looking at measures to prevent the damage in the first place. Did you notice on the new post my \"MomsDaughter\" on the EnCourage thread <community.breastcancer.org/for... that the surgeons were aware that using a blade for surgery does less damage to the lymphatics? Several years ago, when I was first diagnosed, I read a small study in a surgery journal about that being the case, but I haven't seen it mentioned since. So there are things that could be researched that might lead to preventing the damage in the first place, and that's not being done to my knowledge. We all need to use every opportunity to increase awareness of LE at every level.  Okay, climbing down off my soapbox! Keep getting carried away... Be well! Binney",

And I agree, if it's doing that, for goodness sake don't wear it again. But there are still a LOT of things to try that'll help bring the swelling down. For starters, it's possible the glove is a bad fit, or if it was a good fit at first it's a bad fit now. I had the same problem, though, of my hand and fingers swelling, and the fit was great. But it turned out the fabric was wrong. (Who knew?)  Besides compression, there's another factor involved in making our garments, called \"containment,\" and most LE garment fabrics have way more of the containment factor than my vasculature can deal with. This is a rare problem, but not unheard of, for sure. I have to have my garments made of a fabric normally used for infants and the very old (sigh!). The point is, the compression is the same, but the \"containment\" is much lighter. I don't pretend to understand that, but being able to say it gets me the right fabric every time! And of course the opposite may be true: you may need MORE containment, and there are garments for that too. Same compression, more containment. Elvarex is one, and Juzo makes another but I don't remember what it's called. If you need to know I can find out (or hopefully somebody'll come along and tell us both) Anyway, another hand-swelling problem some of the gals here have had seems to be sheer stubbornness on the part of the lymph system. Either a part of the hand or the whole hand just won't reduce. Therapists get vigorous about using chip bags and with a bit of trial and error they come up with a workable solution so the women haven't been reduced to wrapping for the rest of their lives. (Aaaaaugh! ) When an area around the base of my thumb wouldn't reduce, my therapist got creative with the wrapping and got the swelling down in a few days, after which it's been much easier to keep that way. Harley, there's no way any of us can go on doing the massage or the exercises day after day when it isn't even working, so for goodness sake don't beat yourself up over that! The point of all these idiot therapies is to reduce the swelling, when they don't accomplish that there's nothing to be gained from doing them. Please go easy on you, because the LE is bad enough without having to feel defeated and guilty. But hopefully we can at least encourage you that there ARE ways to get the swelling down, and if you and your therapist can work together to find them, then it WILL be worth doing whatever steps you need to in order to have your own hand back. (If your onc nurse tells you different come back and let's talk about it.) As Sharon said, Harley, we hear ya'! Hang in there, and let us know how we can help. Sharon, congrats on a drama-free night! May there be many, many more! Hug all around! Binney ",

Cellulitis usually looks red or splotchy or streaky, usually warm to the touch, sometimes itchy, eventually becomes quite painful. If you anticipate a wait at Urgent Care, take a good book along. If it's not an infection you go home relieved, and if it is you start an antibiotic before it gets out of hand so the rest of the week is a breeze instead of a nightmare. If, on the other hand, you decide not to do that, at least take a permanent marker and draw around the redddened area so you can judge whether it grows or shrinks overnight. If you wake up in the night with pain, go get help. Cellulitis spreads quickly and it's nasty. Nipping it in the bud is not only less stressful, but it makes lymphedema control easier too.

How to the rest of you feel about that? Binney",

Here's a page about how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Lymphedema is more than a bothersome arm -- it's staged, just like breast cancer is, and without treatment it will progress. The progression isn't necessarily in the size of the arm, which may not change much or may go up and down. Progression actually involves what's going on INSIDE your arm: hardening of the tissues, inflammation, fat deposition, skin changes, and very high risk for cellulitis (a fast-spreading infection).  Prompt treatment is also key to ease of managing the lymphedema over time, so please don't be put off by any doctor who wants to take a \"wait-and-see\" approach. The medical professionals who evaluate and treat lymphedema are the well-trained lymphedema therapists, not our surgeons or oncologists, so you want to get in for evaluation as soon as possible. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this -- one thing after another! But with good care you'll soon be on top of it and moving forward again. Please do keep us posted. Gentle hugs, Binney",

So it's certainly your call, but it's worth looking into yourself before you decide how much risk is too much for you individually. I, too, believed what my doctors told me, and I developed lymphedema in my left arm and chest (only one node removed) after a blood pressure on that arm, more than three years after my surgery. If it happens to you, the risk is 100%, and it's for the rest of your life. Here's an information page addressed specifically to doctors and nurses about this issue of mythologizing the reality of our risk: www.stepup-speakout.org/essent...

Some people who have had bilateral surgeries and want to continue to use their arm instead of a foot or leg, offer the arm with the fewest number of nodes removed; others offer their non-dominant arm (since lymphedema in a dominant arm is harder to deal with and more limiting). It's a tough choice. The current thinking by researchers in the field is that about 40% of women who have been treated for breast cancer will eventually develop lymphedema. (Because more women are surviving breast cancer these days, more of them are developing lymphedema, which can show up at any time post-treatment, even years later.) So I guess what I'm saying is, it's your call. With bilateral surgeries both arms are at risk, the one with more nodes removed probably at more risk (though other factors affect risk as well). You can insist on their not using either arm, but they're likely to roll their eyes and tell you it's not a \"real\" risk. But in fact the risk is yours, not theirs. Best suggestion available is to ask any doctor on your team for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for base-line arm measurements for future reference, personalized risk-reduction assessment, and possibly fitting for compression sleeves and gloves to use prophylactically for travel, exercise, or any unusual activities.

Maybe I should take up gambling... Seriously, this doesn't take into account anything but \"external\" issues -- the things that happen to us in treating our bc. But a lot of very serious researchers consider that there may be an inborn component to our risk -- a lymph system with only a limited capacity, say. No way this chart can take that into account. It would be interesting if he included things like whether we're prone to our hands swelling when we hike even before any surgery. In other words, for this to be more accurate we need to know what indicators there may be that our lymph system is less than optimal to begin with. This is also not taking into account previous trauma to the area, and we know from other situations (like LE in football players) that repeated trauma may play a part in developing LE. There are also other pre-conditions that have been implicated: diabetes, other vascular problems -- that are not touched on in this survey model So, interesting, and a promising start. But if anyone tried to use this as a way of steering bc patients into special risk-reduction practices, I'd still be in the \"no-worries\" group, and we know that's not the case! Take-home thought, at least from my point of view: risk reduction education and referrals should be standard procedure for ALL bc patients, starting from before surgery even happens. Dream on!

Your regular massage therapist should NOT work on your affected quadrant (that'd be your arm, shoulder, chest/breast, back and side above the waist on your affected side -- or sides, if you had bilateral surgeries) unless s/he is completely familiar with the risks and able to be very gentle with these areas. The lymph vessels are just below the skin and easily affected by regular massage, which can overload an already-compromised lymph system. The rest of you is fine, of course. The sort of massage that is okay, and may even be prophylactic in helping reduce your risk of lymphedema is called Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). It has to be performed ( and taught to you so that you can do it yourself) by someone fully trained in lymphedema treatment, and certainly not every PT or OT is qualified. To understand the necessary education level and to find one near you, check out this page: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm There are lots of other simple risk reduction actions you can take. Here's a page about it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Hope that helps, and that you never have to join our \"swell\" sorority! Coco, hello! 1/1 means one node was tested, and that node was positive for breast cancer.  Phooey!

Briefly, many women find the electric shavers are as likely to chafe and nick as a regular razor, since the area is so uneven and lumpy. So, many use razors with multiple blades, as they're less likely to cause problems. If you choose to do that be very careful, and if you reuse the razor you can sterilize it first in your dishwasher on HOT. Whichever you use, do keep a careful watch on the area for nicks or abrasions. Treat them with a topical antibiotic and get help at the first suspicion of infection.  Here's a \"coping\" page section about shaving under arms: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#Shaving_under_our_arms There's lots you can do to reduce your lymphedema risk.

Sure hope you never have to join our \"swell\" sisterhood, but really happy you're being so proactive about this. If you were fitted for a day sleeve before surgery, it's understandable that it would be too tight this soon after surgery. Normal post-surgical swelling changes the fit of a compression garment, and a too-tight sleeve is likely to do more damage than good. The night sleeve's a better bet for now, for sure, especially since you're no doubt still resting a lot during the day. You don't mention a compression glove or gauntlet, but it's best always to wear one with a sleeve to prevent any fluid build-up from getting \"stuck\" in your hand. Here's an short article that explains why: http://www.lymphedivas.com/handprotection.asp Be careful of lifting your arm above shoulder level for the first 10-14 days after surgery, as that's the time frame for the tender lymph vessels to repair themselves so you don't want to stress them.

Buy it in a size smaller than you'd normally wear, and be sure to turn it inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin. Another option would be to order a compression vest with short sleeves from any of the custom compression garment makes. That'd provide excellent compression, but my own experience is that it's not real comfortable -- I had trouble breathing with that much compression on my torso. Actually wrapping a shoulder has some real built-in problems that probably can't be overcome unless you sit stone-still after wrapping -- which sure wouldn't be any good for your lymph system (or your state of mind either!)

In Haiti after the earthquake there have been a great number of people with lymphedema caused by the crush injuries to their limbs and chest from falling debris. And lymphedema happens to football players as a result of repeated blows to their chests. The lymph vessels are relatively delicate, they mostly lie close to the skin, and their function can be slowed not only by missing nodes, but by injury and/or scar blockage as well.

They really aggravate the arthritis, so I've had to find out how to adjust them so they work with both conditions. There ARE glove-things made specifically for arthritis (my LE therapist is also a hand therapist so she's shown me the sort they use for that), or you can get finger-stub gauntlets for hand stress in craft or knitting shops. Lymphedema gloves, though, are another animal entirely. It's really a trick to get LE compression gloves to fit well. With the sleeves, since our arms are roughly cylinders, the pressure gets distributed evenly around the circumference of our arm. But our hands are boxier, so when the glove is on it's naturally exerting more pressure sideways against the sides of our hands. For me, unless the measurement around the palm has a bit of leeway in it, it squeezes my hand together toward my palm. That's hard on the knuckles just below where my fingers begin, and it's hard on the base of my thumb too. With too-tight gloves my hand at rest is all squinched together, and I have to really stretch all those joints hard to use my hand -- which makes for a lot of pain after a couple of hours. The other thing that does is to leave the palm itself without any compression, because when my hand is cupped like that the fabric is loose on my palm. So I've found that a slightly adjusted fit actually makes the glove fit better across my palm as well. Which, oddly enough, means that compression is also better on the back of my hand (which is a problem area for some people) because it's not thrown off by the loose fit of my cupped palm. That was hard to explain, so I hope it makes sense. If not, I'll try again. We are all different, so what works for me won't necessarily work for anyone else. That's why I'm hoping others will come along and tell us how they solve their glove problems. It's taken me a lot of trial and error to figure out what I need to control the LE without creating other problems, and it's very hard to be patient with the ordering, re-ordering, fussing with fitters and garment-makers -- aaaaaugh! DON'T settle for a poor fit! These are pricey little \"accessories\" and we need them to fit well in order to do the job they're made for.  Smile nicely and make them listen to you! Whew! Binney",

Cellulitis can \"percolate\" like this for some time before it becomes full-blown. And once it's in there percolating it apparently doesn't need any outside trauma to make it flare again. I'm not a doctor, but I'd guess it'd be a whole lot better to treat the \"percolating\" stage than to wait for it to really get out of hand. People with chronic cellulitis (which in most cases is not like this, but is just many repeat blazing infections) often get relief from low doses of antibiotic over a long period of time. So perhaps that would be a workable approach for \"percolating\" cellulitis, too. What have they tried already, Terri? Have you used a broad-spectrum antibiotic when it's flaring? What tests did they do to determine it's NOT cellulitis? At what stage in this cycle were the tests done? I saw your post last week on the ACOR list and you mentioned the ID doc was stumped and was going to get back with you -- did he, and if so, what was his conclusion? Have they ruled out any underlying bone infection as well? Curiouser and curioser!

      "Content": "Binney4 wrote: Zorrospouse asked on another thread about brands of compression gloves we would recommend, particularly since she already has arthritis in her hand. I do too, and have had some problems with fitting because of it. I've never had a fitter (even my very good one) ask me about arthritis before they measured me for garments, but it'd sure be smart if they did. Not long ago Kira found us a study that showed that with compression for LE, extra-tight is not necessarily better. If the wrapping hurts, it's too tight. And by extension, if the garments hurt they're too tight, too. (Kira, might you post the abstract for us, please, if you still have it?) Or on the other hand, maybe if they're bothering your hands they're just not the best fabric for you. For a while I had a fitter who insisted on tight, and it really bothered my arthritic knuckles. When I convinced her I didn't want it that tight she was able to get me really comfortable gloves that don't irritate my hand. (Geesh!)  For me, the biggest problem is the fit of the gloves across my palm, because if they squeeze my knuckles there it's really a killer by mid-morning. So now my fitter measures that dimension accurately and then gives it a bit more room -- I can tell her when the tape is too tight and how much wiggle-room I want. The looser fit has not worsened my lymphedema. In fact, it's made it better, probably because the pain is no longer drawing lymph fluid to the area. (Well, duh!) There are only a couple brands of gloves I can wear, because I'm also very sensitive to the \"containment\" factor of the fabrics they use (how \"tough\" the fabric is). Bio-Concepts has a fabric they call \"Soft\" that they normally use for very old people and neo-nates (think that one over for a minute: newborns with LE -- breaks my heart!) Anyhow, it feels like heaven, but it doesn't hold up well, because it runs easily. So when I have Bio-Concepts gloves I use Fray-Chek, which is a liquid you can drop onto a run and stop it without making the fabric hard or inflexible, and it doesn't stain or wash out either. You can buy it at Jo-Ann's or a WalMart crafts section. My current favorite brand of garments is Gottfried, because the fabric is not rough or heavy and yet it wears well, the fit is really good, and they actually ship in four days, if you can believe that. My fitter also tells me the company is very nice to work with, so she's as happy as I am. Both Gottfried and Bio-Concepts come in a range of colors, which is another bonus. Black is nice -- goes with most things, even dressy things, and it looks like you're wearing them on purpose instead of because your limb will puff up like a balloon if you don't. I've had people ask me what boutique I bought them from. (I feel like telling them nevermind, they could never afford them.) For nighttime, or any time my arthritis is acting up, the night garments by JoviPak or Solaris work really well to ease the pain and contain the swelling. They're soft and comfortable. I wear them around the house when I'm not planning to go anywhere and love the extra comfort and the fact that, unlike day garments, they actually help reduce the swelling. Okay, sorry for rambling! Anybody else have tips or brands or experiences to offer? Thanks! Binney Log in to post a reply",

It's something I discovered by accident several months ago. I'll try to explain. I developed LE on my left side and arm/hand two years ago. But since developing bilateral LE over a year ago (either wrapping or compression sleeves and gloves on both arms, both hands, and full upper-body vest) I've been weepy and sort of confused -- couldn't always identify what made me cry, but did know my daughter was following me through life with a kleenex box in her hand, which should tell you something. Eventually I also found my mind was sort of drifting off at times, trouble concentrating, and sometimes I just went blank. I thought it must be brain mets. Then four months ago I got an issue of the NLN newsletter that was about pediatric LE. In one article they pointed out that young children with LE have to spend a couple hours a day without compression whether it makes them swell or not, because otherwise they would have a hard time experiencing and learning about the world. When I read that I started to cry (again!) and was confused about whether I was crying for the children or what. All I could think was, \"What about ME!\" So I started researching the sort of thing they were talking about -- sensory stimulation and its effect on children's learning. Eventually I found myself looking into sensory deprivation. I don't recommend googling that, because the bulk of the sites have to do with torture -- sensory deprivation is used at Guantanamo, for instance, to \"soften\" prisoners for interrogation. Their hands and arms are covered in padding so they can't feel anything, and their eyes are covered. So, okay, I can still see. But the effects of sensory deprivation were eerily like my \"symptoms\" -- weeping, confusion, drifting in and out of reality. The other sites about sensory deprivation were equally depressing, in that some people use it to achieve an altered mental state on purpose -- something like an LSD trip. I decided on an experiment, which I started about 3 months ago. I remove my sleeves and gloves for a few hours every evening. I can't do much, because I start to swell very quickly with any exertion, but I can type a little, and I rub my arms across the arms of my chair and generally just enjoy the stimulation of air and textures on my hands and arms. The change has been dramatic, and it happened within a few days. I no longer weep, my concentration has improved considerably, and I don't drift in and out anymore, or experience those blank moments where I couldn't think. So even though this is weird , I'm passing it along in case there are others who are dealing with the bilateral thing and missing out on sensory stimulation. It is apparently not just children who need to remain in touch with their world! Binney Log in to post a reply",

I'm only dropping by here to give you a heads-up on a site where you can access reliable information on lowering your lymphedema risk (and finding treatment help if you should need it! ) It's the National Lymphedema Network web site at www.lymphnet.org, where you can print out their Position Papers on subjects like Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise. Please, please avail yourself of this resource, educate yourself about your lymphedema risk, and take the simple steps to help assure that you won't ever have to deal with it.

      "Content": "Nov 13, 2010 08:24AM - edited Nov 13, 2010 08:30AM by Binney4 KC, I was lying in bed this morning doing a Flexi run and thinking of things to add to this post. I hope other women who use it will come along and add some information and tips too. 1. Lymphedema pumps have a history, and it ain't pretty. The older pumps were literally PUMPS -- they squeezed the limb in an effort to WRING OUT the lymph fluid. As we all know, lymph vessels are delicate and close to the skin, so the way to move lymph is a gentle massage, definitely not a wringing process. The pumps that wring out fluid with a firm pumping action DID get the water out -- but not the larger protein molecules that lymph fluid contains. So the protein remained behind, where it promptly drew the fluid back into the limb as soon as the pumping stopped. The protein also causes the formation of fibrosis, so rings of tough tissue typically formed at the top of the arm and axilla, making the lymphedema worse or even spreading it to the trunk. Newer pumps (like Flexi) don't \"wring\"; they attempt to mimic the gentle movements of Manual Lymph Drainage massage. They include extra steps that are designed to prepare the trunk to receive the fluid that will be moved out of the arm, to prevent back-up of lymph fluid and protein retention. They're not nearly as good at that as a well-trained lymphedema therapist, but they're better than the old-style pumps, and in some cases they're helpful to us in maintaining our self-care. 2.  Words, words, words! We patients call the Flexi a \"pump,\" but Flexi doesn't, and neither do the therapists. They use strings of words like \"sequential\" and \"pneumatic\" and \"device\" because those words better describe it to minds steeped in the horrors of pump history. [And while we're at it, lymphedema therapists are taught not to use the word \"massage\" for Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) either. They prefer to explain MLD with words like \"manipulation\" and tend to direct us to the Greek origins of the word, which is the word for \"knead.\" Since they don't knead us, they don't like the word massage. But unless you speak Greek, that argument doesn't hold a lot of water. The Miriam Webster definition of massage --\"manipulation of tissues (as by rubbing, kneading, or tapping) with the hand or an instrument for therapeutic purposes\" -- works for me. And probably for you. Just be aware it probably doesn't work for your therapist.] 3. There's new research out in the last few months that shows that Flexitouch is effective at moving lymph fluid. It's a very small sample and it was apparently commissioned by Flexitouch, so it's hardly a landmark study. But it's causing some tremors in the lymphedema therapist community. Here's why: there are no studies showing that Manual Lymph Drainage massage by a therapist moves fluid. We all know it does, and it's the gold standard for lymphedema treatment. But nobody's ever funded a really good study to show that it does. (Partly, that's because until recently there wasn't a good way to image lymph flow, but new imaging techniques can follow lymph flow in real time, and that's what the Flexi study used. And partly that's because it's hard to come up with funding for lymphedema studies.) So therapists who used to be enthusiastic about Flexitouch are now worried that Flexi may be preparing to claim MLD isn't necessary and all you need is a Flexi. I haven't heard that from the Flexi folks I've met, but you can almost see why the therapists would be running scared. It's not just their job security either -- it's their genuine belief that the Flexi is no substitute for Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) performed by a well-trained lymphedema therapist, which is absolutely true. So, bottom line, if Flexi ever starts claiming it's a replacement for CDT, then we patients need to raise an outcry about it. But at the moment that's not what they're saying. 4. Medicare (and a lot of other insurance) will cover lymphedema pumps, but not Flexi, because it's more expensive and only sold through the company. Other pumps are not the same, so if your therapist prescribes a Flexi, call the rep and ask her/him to check out what your insurance will pay. If s/he isn't doing their job on that, call the company -- they have people whose job it is to get insurance to pay for it, and they're good at it. If you're turned down they'll even help you appeal (or do it for you). Therapists have relationships with suppliers, so whichever pump your therapist may suggest (even if it's a Flexi), ask WHY that particular brand and make sure the answer makes sense to you and is the best brand FOR YOU. The lymphedema product business is a business, with all that entails. Not unlike, say, the used car business. There are wonderful people in the business with the aim of making our lives better, and there are people in it with the aim of making a living -- but either way they do have to makes ends meet. 5. Here are a few tips from my Flexi rep. For travel, easier for me just to do some self-MLD than to lug it around. But if you're inclined to take it with you, Flexi has a flyer with travel tips -- call them and request it. I have truncal swelling right in front of the axilla and a bit under the arm. The Flexi garment just wasn't getting that area too well. My rep sent me a special padded strap to put over top of the shoulder area that tightens the whole side of it and makes the truncal massage much more effective. It measures about 2-1/2\" by 10\" and has velcro at each end so it attaches easily to front and back of the shoulder and pulls it together closer. Maybe they sell them, I don't know, but if you need one call them up and ask for one, because they really ought to provide it, don't you think? Before hooking up, get a drink and go to the bathroom. Clear your nodes the way your therapist showed you. Because I use it in the morning, I set it all up the night before with the garments stacked on top of the machine in the order I'm going to put them on. That way I don't have to think in order to get started! I wear scrub pants, a cotton undershirt, and a length of stockinette on my arm so I can wash those often, since the garments themselves can't be washed. I live in the desert, and this summer the Flexi trainer expressed surprise that I'd use stockinette -- she wondered if it would be hot. (Hmmm. Well, no hotter than the garments!) I explained that BECAUSE it was hot I needed the stockinette to help absorb the sweat and still be washable. The cycle takes about an hour and getting into the gear takes more time. My rep showed me that I can put on the leg part and start the machine. It pumps the lower body while I put on the jacket, climb into bed and attach the sleeve. I'm all settled down well before the upper-body stuff starts. Do some deep breathing at intervals throughout the cycle. And it helps to consciously relax whatever part of the body is being worked on. If your measurements change or you're uncomfortable with the fit, either make adjustments yourself or call the trainer to come back and help -- they're pretty much obliged to help us make the most of this.  I'm looking forward to other tips from other pump users. Be well! Binney",

On the positive side, it's been temporary for me, and goes away when I'm no longer having to wrap. The night garments (Solaris, Jovi, Telesto) are MUCH lighter and make a big difference, so once therapy's over do look into that for night use.

Of course try your darnedest to avoid nicks, but if you get a nick or scratch treat it promptly with antibiotic cream and keep a close eye on it for redness, swelling or other signs of infection. Clean your shaver on the super-hot cycle in your dishwasher between uses. Hope some of that helps. Be well! Bonnie",

      "Content": "May 16, 2008 11:13AM Binney4 wrote: Hi, swmmom, I'm so sorry for all this worry and confusion. It sure is hard to get the straight story on lymphedema (LE). You must be so frustrated! I have to say that LE therapy is very time-intensive, and a lot of LE therapists are overwhelmed with patients and really have to scramble to find the time to do them all justice. So to some extent it then falls to us to make sure that the treatment we receive is right for our needs. So you're definitely right-on in raising all these questions. From what you've described here, it may be all is well. It would have been better if she'd waited until she'd done a clinical exam to pronounce a diagnosis, but then it may be she works with your doctor a lot and knows she can trust his diagnosis (that is not the case with every doctor!) And it would have been a whole lot better if she'd talk to you about the measurements she took without your having to ask, but that may be more of a personality issue than one of proper technique. As for wrapping without massage, that's maybe a bit odd, but if she had not scheduled sufficient time for massage today (because the first appointment is usually just an evaluation), then the wrapping alone was better than nothing. In fact, wrapping is an extremely effective treatment, and it will also give both you and her some idea of how your LE is likely to respond, and what adjustments may need to be made as treatment progresses. As for wrapping from fingers to shoulder, that's standard, especially if she measured and found problems around your elbow. (If the only measurable swelling was above your elbow, you could reasonably expect her not to wrap your fingers, but they do try to wrap BELOW where your problem areas are to prevent developing new swelling in those areas.) As you noted, the compression garments are more comfortable than the wrapping, and more functional for sure. But the two don't have the same effect. Wrapping can actually reduce swelling, but the compression sleeve and glove will usually only help maintain the size of your arm, not reduce it. So the wrapping is therapeutic - it solves the problem. But the garments are for maintenance, and she won't fit you for them until the therapy is over. When I went to therapy I knew I had swelling in my chest, but didn't know my arm was also involved. The measuring is done because it's impossible to gauge this by eyes alone. The difference between your arms is enough to treat, and the early treatment will definitely make a difference in how easy it is to treat and how successful the therapy will be. It's sort of like pregnancy - there's no such thing as being \"a little\" pregnant. And there's no such thing as \"a little\" LE either. Before any swelling at all can be measured, there can be as much as 30% more lymph fluid stagnating in your tissues than is normal. So LE is present even BEFORE it's measurable. (It used to be that insurance wouldn't pay for treatment until a large amount of swelling could be measured, but thankfully that standard no longer exists, and you can receive treatment as soon as possible, making your outcome better.) Foam for your breast: first let me say that at your next visit, when she does the massage, she will start with your neck and will massage your chest/breast before massaging your arm. Since she's said she'll teach you this, that's great. If you can, bring someone with you next time to take notes, as it's a steep learning curve and may seem confusing at first. The foam is used to break up the fibrosis (hardness) and it's quite effective. If she wrapped your chest/breast like she does your arm, you wouldn't be able to breathe. So instead, they use chipped foam pieces in a cloth covering, or textured sheet foam, to cover the areas that need softening. Your muscle movements as you go about your daily activities help to move the lymph, because the foam adds pressure from the outside. I wouldn't say it's uncomfortable, exactly, but it's bulky and pesty. And frankly it always makes me sad, because it's a constant reminder of everything I'd rather forget. But on the other hand, it works, and eventually you can move on to finding a bra that works to control the LE for you (along with the massage you're going to learn). Since you're just beginning the wrapping, what she said about doing whatever you can with your arm as long as it isn't painful is good advice. As you get used to it you'll want some gentle exercises to do while wrapped, as that helps move fluid. So ask her next time for specifics. Or get the book by Burt and White called \"Lymphedema: A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing,\" which has a section on exercises. And is a good reference book to have at any rate. (And by the way, be sure to learn to do the wrapping yourself too -- there will be times when your LE acts up and you'll want to know how to bring it back under control yourself.) All that to say, she sounds like she's doing okay. But I want to add this: our relationship with our therapists is long-term, and we do better when it's someone we trust and respect and don't dread talking to or seeing. That's a really individual thing. So if you continue to have not-good feelings about her, it'd be fine to look around for a second opinion. We hire these people, not the other way around. Swmmom, I just gotta say you're at a really hard point right now. You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed. Or angry. Or super sad. It's no easy matter to get through all the bc garbage only to find yourself faced with this demanding, distressing condition. But at least with the bc we've all had to learn how to take this one day at a time, and LE is the same. Onward! It gets better, honest! Big (((((hugs!))))) and prayers, Binney Oh, a couple of P.S.'s: 1. If you haven't already read them, you might be interested in the Position Papers on LE Therapy and on Therapist Training at the National Lymphedema Network: www.lymphnet.org 2. If your screen name indicates a love for swimming, you'll be happy to know that as soon as you're past the wrapping stage, swimming is one of the best exercises there is for LE.",

Definitely an emotional time. It is normal (and good news!) for the wrapping to be loose now, because the arm is reducing. I know it wasn't real big before, but apparently there was fluid there, and the wrapping has helped. Good for you for making it through the night! I hope you also got some sleep, though for me it took awhile to get used to actually sleeping in my Michelin-man costume -- I did a lot of fancy flopping around in bed instead. I take it your next appointment is not until after the weekend? In that case, when you're ready to take off the bandages and shower, don't try to re-wrap yourself until you've been taught a bit more. It's too easy to wrap too tight or just not get the pressure graduated enough, and that can cause you more trouble than going without. My first weekend she told me to just leave it off, and the following weekend it was time for me to try it myself. (If you're like me, better allow plenty of time for that, as I had to pick up and re-roll all the bandages I heaved around the room in frustration!) It gets easier, so hang in! When the swelling comes down you \"graduate\" to a compression sleeve and glove for daytime use, but most of us need to wrap at night to keep control. There's an alternative to that. It's a special night sleeve that's two fabric layers with foam quilted in between. It's bulky but comfortable, and a lot easier to put on and take off than the bandages. But that's a problem for another day. For now, I'm with you in hoping the chemistry is better with Therapist #2. (In Germany, where they're waaaaay ahead of us in LE care, they try to have different therapists work on you throughout the therapy time, because each one does things a bit differently, and each little bit helps.) Your daughter sounds like fun! Hope the price of learning to swim is not too steep! How about a water aerobics class at the local pool? Might be less pricey! swmmom, you'll be fit again. Takes time but it's definitely doable, and the fact that you were fit before treatment has already made a difference to your healing and will continue to stand you in good stead. And as a bonus, as you lose that extra weight the LE will become easier to control. Use your good arm to pat yourself on the back for your bright spirit and determination. It'll be good! Let us know how #2 goes, Binney  ",

But lymph fluid is not just water, it's partly protein molecules, which are comparatively large. If they're not well diluted they tend to get sluggish and \"stuck.\" So keeping your body extra-well hydrated helps the lymph fluid flow. One problem that we lymphers sometimes have is a misdiagnosis, when a doctor doesn't realize it's lymphedema that's causing the swelling. They'll prescribe a diuretic, which drains out the smaller, watery molecules and leaves the protein molecules behind. Actually makes the LE worse and makes the tissues hard. Who knew?! If you're at risk for lymphedema but don't have it yet, staying well-hydrated helps keep your compromised lymph system healthy. Especially important in summer and on airplanes, where the cabin air is dry.  LE doesn't make any sense! Patti, hello! lvtwoqlt really covered it. The only thing I could add would be to consider being fitted for a compression sleeve and glove to use when you're exercising, traveling, or doing any physical work like lifting or shoveling.

You've been really patient! See if she can teach you more about wrapping it yourself, and ask her what she wants you to do next time it loosens and starts to fall apart. Will they set up a more regular schedule (several days a week) after your next scheduled visit? If not, you might want to see what other resources you might have nearby. At the moment, though, they're sounding reasonable about working to keep you safe and progressing until they can schedule things better. There are not enough LE therapists in this country, so waits such as yours are not unusual. Cardio is fine, but maybe take it a bit easier until you have things under better control. How about a few 15-minute stints on the treadmill at intervals throughout the day, so you can gauge how it's affecting you arm before proceeding? And I'd sure stay away from the weight lifting for now. Any exercise is more beneficial if the bandages are tighter rather than unravelling. Don't worry, you'll get back to it -- gradually! -- as you get regular wrapping done and start massaging to open more lymph pathways. Tonight, keep your arm elevated as much as you can -- maybe a pillow arrangement in bed for the night. This is all quite messy, yes? It gets better! Hugs, prayers, Binney ",

(You might talk to your therapist about wearing a sleeve and glove for exercising or strenuous activity too -- like moving the couch or packing up a box of books or shoveling the snow...) Here are some web sites for the quilted night garments: www.jovipak.com www.solaris-tribute.com http://www.telesto-medtech.com These kinds of garments are often very helpful (I use them for chest and both arms), and they're actually fairly comfortable. They're custom made for any part of you that you need it for. Usually they're covered by insurance at the same rate as day garments -- but make sure, because they're pricey. There are some therapists who can help patients with them, and some therapists who have never used them. (Which as far as I'm concerned is one reason why I love these boards - no other way to get some information!) For day use, bygrace uses abdominal garments made for plastic surgery by a Brazilian company called Annette, which I think you can find here: http://www.laurensilva.com/annette_international_s/1011.htm Hope some of that helps! Binney ",

I was only saying that using diuretics to treat LE is the wrong thing to do. There are other reasons why diuretics are needed, and then you have to take them, but it becomes a balancing act. You should make your prescribing doctor aware of the problem of diuretics affecting your LE, so he can monitor everything and help you use the least amount necessary. It also helps to limit salt intake, but you're no doubt doing that already. As to wearing your garments only when exercising or otherwise using your arm, if you already have LE that may not work. (It's a good strategy for preventing LE if you don't already have it but are at risk.) But why not ask your therapist if you can do some experimenting? As long as your arm is in good control you can try leaving the garments off for a couple of hours when you're not doing anything with that arm. See how that works before trying anything else. If the swelling remains in good control you can try extending the time. Once you determine what works for you, you can try experimenting with not wrapping one night. If that works, you can extend it to every-other-night for a bit and see what happens. Don't try both of those things at once, though, or you won't know which one is working and which isn't. Just keep very careful watch and, if you have swelling, back off on the experiment and add some extra massage throughout the day until things are back in control. Do keep your therapist aware of what you're doing in case you have questions along the way. Some of the women here do get away with only wrapping occasionally at night, or not using their day garments full time. But for myself it's a constant battle. Because I have bilateral LE and both arms and hands (and upper body) in compression garments all the time, I started to have some sensory deprivation problems, so I now remove my gloves and sleeves for a couple of hours most evenings, but I can't do anything or they swell right up. My chest starts to swell within about 20 minutes if I remove the compression (and it hurts too!), so thats never an option for me. But the evening breaks from compression are delightful and much-needed. (With children who have LE they find they have to remove the compression for a couple of hours at least every day, even if there's some swelling, because otherwise they don't have enough sensory contact with their environment. Interesting, yes?) By the way, wrapping at night is the absolute best deal for night, but frankly I haven't got the patience for it (maybe because it's both arms, and that's a lot of very awkward wrapping!) So I use special night garments, which are made by companies like Solaris-Tribute, JoviPak, Telesto Medtech, and Peninsula Medical. It's another option you could talk to your therapist about if you're interested. Does that help any? Hope so! (((((Hugs!))))) ",

There's gotta be other attractions at the resort that you can both enjoy besides the hot tub, no?

One thing to watch out for is cold fingers -- no extremes of temperatures for LE.

Don't know what brand you have, but a couple of manufacturers make them in colors. If you don't need custom-made garments, Lymphedivas are classy, and for either off-the-shelf or custom garments, Bio-Concepts offers about 40 different colors (or combinations of colors, if you're a sports fan.) You don't say whether you've done LE Therapy, but if not that's an important starting place, and it gives you the tools you need (massage, bandadging, exercise, and skin care essentials) to regain control if it gets out of hand. (Hmmm. That was not a pun...) Here's an article about recent research about weight loss and LE, which matches Neat's experience: http://www.upmccancercenters.com/news/reuters/reuters.cfm?article=11290 And here's a link to an article about medical tax deductions that points out how you can deduct expenses for weight-loss programs : http://www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/tips/20010323a.asp Hope some of that helps. I'm really sorry you've joined the ranks of us \"swell\" ladies, but glad you found us.  Be well! Binney ",

I developed lymphedema on a flight to a small town in Alaska, which made for a mighty unhappy trip. It's a controversial subject, and our doctors often offer little knowledgeable guidance. A couple of precautions: If you get compression garments, make sure they fit well. Poorly fitting garments can cause more problems than they solve. Here's a page to give you an idea of how they ought to fit/feel. Try them out a couple of times BEFORE you need them on a flight. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm Always wear hand protection (a compression glove or gauntlet -- which is a fingerless glove) when you wear a sleeve so any swelling does not get trapped in your hand. If you decide not to wear compression garments for travel (or exercise, or any strenuous or unusual activity) you might want to get them anyway, and carry them with you in your carry-on luggage. That way, if you develop problems you have a way to deal with it, even in a strange town far away from your medical team. When you travel, use wheeled luggage (and be careful about hefting suitcases around the house as you pack, into overhead bins, and off luggage carousels). Stay VERY well hydrated -- it dilutes the lymph fluid and helps keep it flowing. Stop often to take a few deep abdominal breaths -- it stimulates the largest, central lymph vessel in our bodies. Do frequent arm stretches and gentle exercises -- with arm as high as is comfortable over your head, open and close your fist slowly several times; pretend you're a cat and \"claw\" at the air; extend your arms in front of you and bend at the elbow to touch your nose. More lymphedema risk reduction ideas here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Bon voyage, and no \"swell\" trips ever! Binney",

A long-sleeved leotard or \"body armor\"-type sport shirt in a size smaller than you'd normally wear can help. Wear it inside out so the seams don't irritate. Stay VERY well hydrated, avoid salty foods, take deep abdominal breaths several times a day. Stay out of the heat (yeah, right! In the Valley of the Sun?) and keep your hand and arm out of hot water.

She may be a LANA therapist (and that's a good thing!), but she can't feel the pressure like you can, so she needs your input to adjust it. Also, have her spend enough time to help YOU learn how to adjust it. Now that you've used it awhile that skill will be easier--right at first it's just sort of impossible to take in! I hate to say this, but sleeping in it is really NOT a good idea. When it's working it's mimicking a message, but when it's turned off it sure isn't mimicking compression garments. Any wrinkles or squashed places could easily create a tourniquiet effect and make things worse instead of better.  When the machine shuts off, take off the garments. (Hint from personal experience: do not just dump them off the bed onto the floor, because if you get up later in the dark you could, uh, trip over the hoses, which is not a graceful move.) I'm sorry about the guilt-trip from the former therapist. Most unhelpful! Life continues to happen, and you need help finding great, workable solutions, not being tsk'ed at for what's impossible to do. Bottom line is, are you managing to keep the swelling in control. If so, that's the point. If not, we could all brainstorm with you if you'd like--there's a wealth of experience on this board! Be well! Binney",

Actually, there are researchers who are trying to stimulate the regrowth of the lymphatics. They're using something our bodies make called VEGF that makes new lymph vessels. There are serious problems with it. First of all, there's no way to control how many new lymph vessels it makes, so in the rabbits and pigs it's been tried in there's a whole glut of new vessels, and they grow all crazy, like weeds. The other problem is scarier, especially for those of us who have had BC. Cancer tumors need blood vessels AND LYMPH VESSELS in order to grow, the more the merrier (for the tumor, not for us!) So if we introduce a factor that causes vigorous lymph vessel growth into an area where there may be stray cancer cells remaining, it may well encourage tumor growth. So far it's only been tried in animals, where the lymphedema was created by purposely destroying the lymph vessels, and the critters had no cancer to start with. And what happened in some of these experiments was that lots of (apparently benign) tumors grew there too. Which is not exactly reassuring as far as safety is concerned. And here's an even more alarming thing: the researchers doing this are in the U.S., but since the FDA would not allow research with VEGF on humans at this point (too risky), they're planning to start Phase I experiments on post-bc women in another country. Not surprisingly, it's planned for the country where the drug to do this with has been developed. Big pharma, big money--and in this case, big risks for our Sistahs of Swell in other parts of the world.  So--there's hope for your idea, Mini! But it's not quite as safe and simple as we wish. Lymphedema never is! Be well! Binney",

Navygirl, I'm sorry I don't remember this, but do you have a lymphedema therapist? If not, it would make sense to get a referral to one pronto. Here's a web page about finding a well-trained one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm ACE bandages are really not a good idea for an arm with lymphedema or at risk for it. The bandages used for lymphedema have much less stretch to them and are applied with a gradiant compression, so they promote lymph flow. ACE bandages are too stretchy and can bind in some places, especially with the exertion of shoveling, with the same effect as a blood pressure cuff of cutting off lymph flow instead of encouraging it. If you have a long-sleeved sport shirt (like Under Armour) or a leotard, wear that instead, only turn it inside out so the seams don't press into your skin. Isotoner therapetic gloves under your mittens can help control hand swelling until you can be fitted for a glove or gauntlet. Stay very well hydrated -- drink plenty of water as you work. Warm it up and stick it in a thermos and keep it handy. Stop and rest your arm often. Try some gentle stretches over your head and out to the side, make a fist one finger at a time and open it slowly) Keep your hands warm. Even with no lymphedema our hands swell as they \"thaw out\" after winter outdoor activities. For someone at risk of lymphedema, this normal swelling can really overtax the system, so keep your hands from the extreme cold. Elevate your arm when you come inside, and on pillows at night. I don't have to tell you to take deep abdominal breaths to help stimulate lymph flow, because shoveling will have you breathing deeply! If your arm or hand starts to ache or tingle, STOP AT ONCE and go inside and elevate it. Not, \"just a couple more shovelfuls.\" Not, \"just to the end of the drive.\" Just, STOP. It's not worth it. Good idea for using that snow, btw -- just stay away from the yellow snow! Be well, Binney",

What you might do about it is to insist on a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist (that'd be a PT or OT with an additional 135 hours in specifically lymphedema training BEYOND her PT or OT certification -- be sure to call and ask before you go, as adequate training is especially important with chest lymphedema). She can evaluate your situation by simple physical exam. If she finds lymph fluid in the tissues she can teach you a gentle massage and exercise routine to drain it and improve the skin texture and, best of all, help you reduce the serious infection risk that comes with lymphedema. Lymphedema can be present BEFORE any swelling appears, and if you start treating it then you can hope for great results. Do it! Either way, you'll be glad you did!

When I overdid it I did know my fingers were stressing, but I kept on because I had a \"deadline\" in my head. No deadline's that important, but I still find it difficult to stop when I sense something I'm doing is probably going to give me grief. Instead (duh!)

Gottfried, for instance, has a four-day turn-around time, which is worth gold if you ask me. Still, if it has to be Elvarex there aren't a lot of options. (Juzo makes an Elvarex-tough fabric, can't remember the name of it right now -- but that might be faster, don't know. Your fitter could find out.) One thing you might try is washing them and hanging them to dry with a fat magic marker in the offending finger (capped tightly, of course!) -- sometimes that gives it some room and corrects simple problems. If it's been measured too small, though, that isn't going to work in the end. Maybe worth a try... Moogie, I sure hope this gets solved promptly.

There is research that supports the fact that overweight people are at higher risk for developing lymphedema after breast cancer treatment.

(For that matter, lymphedema is very common in obese people even without cancer, and for them it frequently goes away if they lose the excess weight.) There are other (admittedly small) studies that indicate that weight loss in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema makes lymphedema control easier and reduces both swelling and discomfort.

The studies have nothing to say about NOT getting LE if you're thin, just about your risk being considerably higher if you aren't. It's amazing to me how many doctors have then assumed it meant \"if you're not overweight you won't get LE.\" Nuts to that! Other factors generally accepted as increasing risk are treatment on your dominant side, post-surgical infection and seromas. None of those--or even all of those at once--\"guarantee\" you'll get LE. Just that the risk is higher when those conditions are present. AND\u2026we have to factor in that there's a lot that scientists still don't know. Some contend there are genetic factors involved as well. Seems likely to me too, but there's no way currently to identify those at risk because of genetics. Me, apparently, if we go by how unlikely I was otherwise to end up with this! There's some really good research in progress right now to try to understand the actual physiology of the lymph system--information that's still sadly lacking. I'm holding out great hopes that solid research like that will eventually help us understand--and maybe even prevent and cure--lymphedema. Onward! Binney",

Kira and I were talking yesterday about how, if you have diabetes and want to control it, the patient educators always tell you to \"think like a pancreas.\" We lymphers who want to keep our LE in control have to learn as much as we can about it so we can \"think like a whole lymph system.\"  I have a great therapist (she's never brought me muffins, but we've gone out for pie together, and she treated -- does that count, Kira?!) Following my initial therapy intensive (5 weeks) back in 2004, I see her every six months or so for complete re-measuring and to ask my gazillion new questions. And I fill her in on new LE products that the gals here have recommended. We have a symbiotic relationship! Suzy, those \"horrid cancer things from lymphedema\" are called lymphangiosarcomas. They're very rare, and don't happen until after the first decade with LE, and are related to long-standing out-of-control LE. Just another reason to do our best to keep things in control and as best we can. Suzy, my hand inflates when I wrap anything too tight. You're right about being careful with the \"gradient\" business, but it's also possible to wrap the hand too tight too. Wrapping too tight can result in \"rebound\" swelling. Just wanted to note how grateful I am that there are A LOT more LE products available now than there were six years ago, and that makes fine-tuning our control world's easier (still NOT easy!) Especially with truncal LE, it used to be there was literally NOTHING out there to help control swelling, and now there's a wide range of choices. Same with colored and patterned day sleeves, a choice of night garments, new donning aids, and lots of new technologies for dealing with this. And even better: there are more products being developed, much more research, and (this you will find it hard to believe, but trust me, it's true!) loads more LE awareness. In just six years!

I'm doing battle with it now too, wrapping off and on and also using a DVD exercise program called The Lebed Method: http://www.gohealthysteps.com/Store I use the first two sections (opening exercises and leg stretches) daily, and it really helps. There are also youtube videos of the exercises that are free and easy to access if she'd like to give it a try. I agree with floaton that water therapy might be helpful as well. If you have access to a pool you know is scrupulously clean she can enjoy just cooling off and moving gently through the water. A regular water aerobics class would probably be too strenuous to start with, but standing shoulder-deep in the water and moving her arms about, or doing a few laps of a gentle stroke might really improve both the swelling and the pain. Something to check out with the PT, for sure. Finally, I've had problems with \"rebound swelling,\" which happens when I've been wrapped too tightly. For some of us lower compression is less aggravating than higher compression, which can cause the lymph system to react by introducing more fluid into the area. Worth experimenting with, perhaps--just try wrapping less tightly and see if her arm responds better. Doesn't work for everyone, but when it does it indicates we're \"compression sensitive.\" As for whether the shoulder inflammation is causing more blockages, it's more likely that the inflammation is triggering her body to send in more lymph fluid. Any pain or injury causes our bodies to rush lymph fluid to the site so that any \"bad actors\" can be carried away to the lymph nodes and destroyed. So, yes, the inflammation could be causing the lymphedema to be harder to manage, but not because of new blockages. Give your mom a hug for me. Hugs and prayers for both you amazing women! Binney ",

Glad you had the antibiotic with you and could start right away. My doctor says to use the oral only if I see signs of infection, but I think in your situation (street dirt, no local doctor handy) I'd start it too. Only other thing I can think of is to do gentle massage as often as possible to help clear the swelling. It is lymph fluid that rushes to injury sites and makes them swell, but the LE will make it harder for the lymph to do its job (garbage collection, basically) and get out. So do the node clearing often throughout the day and the full massage as far as it's comfortable. And of course no massage or compression if you note any signs of infection. I'd avoid as much pain as possible (yeeks! no more alcohol on open wounds!) by using pain killers of whatever sort works for you, because pain draws more lymph fluid. In the Netherlands, huh? I believe Dutch chocolate by mouth is very effective for this kind of problem. Worth a try, anyway. ((((((Hugs!))))))  Binney ",

I hear you on not wanting to worry from now on about nicks and bites and who-knows-what. That is, for sure, not easy to face. Here's the thing: bad as lymphedema is, it's not even in the same class as the breast cancer beast. And it's treatable. Not convenient, not fun, but definitely manageable. Those of us who have it already have learned to deal with the threat of infection by keeping wet-wipes and antibiotic handy for those scrapes and nicks. It's doable. Bad news first: with the surgery you've already had, you are already at risk for lymphedema (LE). Whether your surgeon is aware of it or not (many are not) any surgery to our chests puts us at risk regardless of the number nodes removed. Many of us here have had only one node removed and have developed LE, or we've developed it following prophylactic mastectomies. Yes, more nodes removed increases the statistical risk, but the risk is there already and you'll want to know how to reduce that risk, recognize possible problems, and get help if you should ever need it.  The good news: there are simple steps you can take to reduce your risk. You can find them at the National Lymphedema Network website in their Position Papers. The ones on \"Risk Reduction,\" \"Exercise,\" and \"Air Travel\" are especially helpful. All here: www.lymphnet.org Please, fight the beast first, with everything you've got. And throughout your journey, do let us know how we can help you deal with your lymphedema risk AND get your life back at the same time. You can do this! ((((Hugs!)))) and best wishes for a smooth and succesful journey through treatment, Binney ",

There's still beauty, joy and gratitude yet to come, but you'll have to trust me on that, because the learning curve on the LE is a steep one. (I love your tag line about the gratitude-joy-prayer-gratitude connection. The joy part is where the strength comes from, so watch for those moments of joy each day and hang on to them.) If your fingers are swelling you need a glove, not a gauntlet, but it sure is possible you're just mixed up on the terminology. A gauntlet has no fingers, just a palm and a thumb; a glove has fingers, but the tops are cut off so we can still feel things with our finger pads. I'm not sure what you mean by an adjustable garment, but there are some sleeves with velcro straps that can be adjusted up the arm. They're a bit bulkier that a regular daytime compression sleeve, and I personally don't find them as comfortable, but give it a try and see if it works well for you. Most of us have had to experiment around to find what works best for us, so don't be afraid to speak up if it isn't a workable solution for you (don't be too discouraged either--it comes with the territory!) The good news is there are lots of options for LE control out there, and you'll land on the right one sooner than you think. It's great that you're learning self-MLD and bandaging. The wrapping is awkward, but it's the quickest way to reduction, and it's also a skill that's good to know for those times when you overdo and might experience a flare in the swelling. Have you seen some overall improvement in the swelling? Usually the response is pretty quick and you see progress within days. Three or four weeks is the usual first course of treatment, and for some the swelling is reduced by then. For others it may take another course of a few weeks later on to get full reduction. After treatment it's controlled by careful exercise, self-MLD, and compression garments. Some women need to wear them 24/7, others only in the daytime or only at night, and a lucky few only when exercising or traveling. An adjustable garment can be used either in the day or at night. Regular compression sleeves and gloves or gauntlets are only for daytime wear, when you're active and awake. Wrapping or special quilted, foam-filled night garments can be used for sleep. But you don't need all of that now. Just concentrate on trying out the garments that have been ordered for you and there will be time later to make changes as they're needed. Simple things can help. Elevate your arm whenever you can--on the back of the couch while you read or watch TV, on pillows at night. Stay REALLY well hydrated (it helps dilute the lymph fluid and keep it moving). Take a minute or two at intervals throughout the day for a few deep abdominal breaths (it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies). I sure do hear you about the roller-coaster emotions. Dealing with a new chronic condition is a grieving process, and grief is hard work. Give yourself all the room you need. You can do this! Chocolate helps! Warm hugs, Binney",

Lymphapress is a fairly forceful pumping system, usually recommended for those with advanced (and most often long-term) LE. The company is also fairly forceful, though, and their sales tactics sometimes result in their being sold more or less indiscriminately. So there may be a specific reason why your therapist recommended this for you, or it may just be it's the brand s/he is used to promoting. Pumps are not a standard lymphedema treatment; they're a substitute for self-Manual Lymphatic Drainage done at home by us women ourselves. Some people find them useful, most prefer the ease of self-MLD. A pump is helpful in circumstances where self-MLD can't be done by the patient herself or is burdensome (like someone with arthritis or shoulder problems, or someone with several limbs involved). Self-MLD may also be less likely to cause you exhaustion problems. It's also quicker and more convenient, as it doesn't tie you down for an hour at a time. At any rate, using the pump twice a day is certainly excessive, unless there's a specific reason why your LE is especially hard to manage. Even so, I would think the twice-a-day regimen might be suggested for a very short period of time--perhaps a week or two at most, followed by a professional re-assessment of the progress made. If you weren't taught self-MLD, give your therapist a call and arrange for her/him to teach you. Or see another therapist for a second opinion and help arranging a self-care program that's more practical and less of a time burden. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm That said, LE really is a full-time consideration, even if it's not a part-time job! Remembering to stop and do some deep breathing several times a day, staying really well-hydrated, and finding the right compression garments to do the job are all on our minds constantly. The good news is, it gets easier--honest! Gentle hugs, Binney",

But if I detach it to do something active with my arm, the area around my elbow swells, so that makes no sense that I can see. One thing I can say for sure about it is that nobody stares at it or asks me questions about it--I think it looks like a normal arm support for tennis elbow or whatever. I rarely use it at night because the Solaris or JoviPak foam-filled are more comfortable for sleep, but I'll use mine in the daytime when I'm dealing with a flare and don't want to wrap. Sometimes it works just fine for that, other times wrapping is necessary. I'm glad I have it as a tool I can use, but I wouldn't be happy with it as my only resource. JMHO, Binney",

I'm sorry, but I can't remember whether you've been taught to wrap your own arm or not. If so, the Juxtafit needs to be applied with the same kind of care as wrapping, making sure the pressure is lowest near your axilla and very gradually more toward your hand. Swelling in the upper arm probably means that EITHER the upper arm was too loose, or the lower arm to tight (or maybe both). Swelling in the wrist might result from too tight compression further up on your arm, or too loose lower down. You might take the whole arrangement in to your therapist and ask her to watch you put it on, watching for compression errors that could cause you grief and helping you figure out the best way to use it. Then again, if you need nighttime compression, you might just want to order a night garment from Solaris or JoviPak--no tricky adjustments needed! (Whew!) Big hugs, Binney",

The time is NOW to see a lymphedema therapist. You can ask for a referral from any member of your team. The sleeve you describe doesn't sound like a good fit, so probably best just to start over with an evaluation and therapy, then get new garments that fit properly. (But in answer to your question, wearing a well-fitting garment with cording won't cause Lymphedema problems.) You might want to remove your rings for now so that an unexpected flare-up doesn't result in having to have them cut off. Besides what the Moderators posted, there's lots and lots of information here:http://www.stepup-speakout.org And for specific ideas of what you can do until you can see a therapist: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#while%20waiting The best news of all is that catching these symptoms early and getting prompt treatment will make therapy quicker and easier, and on-going self-care much more manageable. YES! Cording, BTW, can return, so that's not an impossibility.

Here's an article (written by a real LE expert/researcher) about when you need hand protection (a gauntlet or glove) with a compression sleeve (of course if you already have swelling in your hand or fingers, a glove is a given): http://www.lymphedivas.com/comprehensivecompression.asp Wrapping is an important tool in self-care. For air travel (or even long car trips) and dealing with flares it's really the gold standard. It's a steep learning curve, but so worth the effort, because knowing how to do it gives you so much more control going forward. If your therapist will teach you and your SO will video it, have him stand behind you and shoot over your shoulder, so when you view it it's from your perspective--makes it easier to follow. Do ask for a refresher course for you and your SO on MLD. Even therapists who do this multiple times every day need refresher courses (Vodder therapists get together every two years for them) in order to keep their skills up-dated. There's lots to it, so it takes plenty of repetition to get the hang of it and feel confidant doing it on your own. Go for it! Hugs, Binney",

Keep an eye on the uncovered portion and remove it if any swelling starts to happen there. Do run it by your therapist so she can spot any potential problems (some of the gals here take pictures and email them to their therapists, but an in-person visit is better if it's possible). You DO sound like you're coping well--brava! Better break out the chocolate to celebrate. The manufacturer should have some mention in the material you got with it about lotion. Some brands aren't a bit fussy, others don't like lanolin, so check with them. Don't wear them too long at a time the first day. Take 'em off and check out your skin, lotion, give it a rest, then try it again for a bit longer. Elbow crease and web between thumb and pointer can get red and irritated at first. A bit of cornstarch or pure baby powder can help in those areas while the skin gets used to the insult of compression. I put powder in the toe of a clean cotton sock, close the top with a sturdy rubber band, and use that to pat it on just where I need it--saves on the bathroom floor mess. Keep us posted! Binney",

Usually done initially by your therapist, then by you as needed to control swelling--once the swelling is reduced you use the garments to keep it that way. Yeah, creative colors aren't a good thing, so it does sound like, for the time being, the fit it okay for containing the swelling that's currently there. Onward to wrapping!

There are women here who have had reactions to various kinds of sleeves, and I hope they'll be along soon to share their experiences. Has she tried the non-elastic garments, like the Circaid Juxta-fit? They're comfortable (I tried one and was pleasantly surprised at both the fit and the feel) and can be used for both day and night wear. I'm thinking of ordering one for my next go-round with new garments. Here's specific information on Juxta-fit fiber content from the StepUp-SpeakOut website: \"Circaid's Juxta-Fit garments are made of a Breath-O-Prene and lined with SilverTec to fight odors; it is anti-microbial. (NO LATEX!) Juxtafit comes in standard sizes but can also be custom sized for individual patients.\" I believe Breath-O-Prene is a lycra/nylon/foam construction, but not specifically spandex, but you could check with Circaid before ordering, or ask them for a sample to test on her skin. (On the other hand, according to Lymphedivas, their fiber is also 81% nylon and 19% lycra, but with aloe and a wicking agent added, so if she hasn't tolerated the Lymphedivas there may be more to this than spandex.) You might also want to check with Juzo, Miro, and Lymphededivas for their fiber content so you can come up with what they have in common (besides spandex) that could be causing the problem. Then you can query other manufacturers to see who can offer something without the offending fiber. Here's a garment page index that might help you organize a search: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema_garments.htm Looking forward to learning what others here have to contribute from their experiences.

My veins just don't need that kind of experimentation, so I thank them but decline.) The biggest problem I have with colonoscopies and LE is that, with both arms wrapped, none of the hospital ID bracelets fit . Once they used my ankle for those, but last time some very inventive woman at the intake desk came up with a solution by linking two bracelets together somehow. Whatever! When it's a matter of two at-risk arms I have heard arguments about using the one with the fewest nodes removed, but my own experience with being bilateral is that LE is a lot harder to deal with in your dominant arm, so I think going for the non-dominant arm is a legitimate consideration. But I've never heard of anyone suggesting using an arm that already has LE for any of that, especially not an IV. It doesn't even make sense to be putting fluid into an arm that's already having trouble handling fluid -- you'd have to wonder if the delivery of the IV meds would be affected as well. Just a thought. I always take educational materials along with me and pass them out to everyone and anyone. Jobst makes a free booklet you can order in whatever quantity that's great for medical professionals. Maybe it's a stretch to think of a colonoscopy as a \"teaching moment,\" but hey! Works for me!

We've actually mentioned your product before on this thread, Carolyn, along with the tatto-pattern oversleeves from www.mysassysleeve.com. Take a look a little higher up on the thread and you'll see it there. Adding an elastic-type oversleeve runs the possibility of increasing the compression of the sleeve, without increasing the compression of the glove -- NOT a good combination. Constriction danger would also exist if they were tighter at one place along your arm than at another (which of course depends on the shape of our individual arms), or if you bought a size that was tight all up your arm and added compression. Checking the fit with your therapist before wearing them is the best bet for safety, and that's especially true if you're wearing garments to prevent lymphedema, because extra compression at one place along your arm could have the same nasty effect as a blood pressure cuff. As we've mentioned elsewhere, Carolyn, LympheDivas had pictures of women wearing sleeves without any hand protection -- a very risky image to use in advertising any lymphedema product. When we approached them about it they put into action a plan to reverse that image, including an excellent article on their site about hand protection and a promise to change their advertising with the next season's pictures to assure that they do not encourage any woman to neglect hand protection. The SassySleeve site is not trying to be a fashion statement and they do not sell their oversleeves specifically for lymphedema, so they're not the same kind of problem. But the picture on your site, like that at LympheDivas, is not medically correct. Have you thought about correcting that impression for the safety of women at risk for lymphedema? Be well, Binney",

That's because an ACE has a lot of stretch, and when you move it will not give your skin the support it needs to help move lymph fluid, the way a short-stretch bandage will. In fact, it can easily do the same kind of damage as a blood pressure cuff. Learning to wrap with short-stretch bandages takes time and practice because the compression has to be graduated as it goes up your arm. Too tight or too loose will give you problems too. It sounds like you need some massage and wrapping from your therapist before you're ready to be fitted for garments. That will reduce you arm as much as possible, and learning to wrap it yourself with a combination of gauze, proper padding, and layered short-stretch bandages will give you the tools you need to deal with your LE even on these MISERABLE summer days.

(Except maybe in Germany, where so much of our knowledge of lymphedema treatment has come from.) It IS important that a compression sleeve and glove (or gauntlet) fits you well. A poor fit that binds or sags can do more harm than good. BUT it usually isn't necessary for prevention to have custom-made garments, as the companies that make them have a range of sizes and shapes to fit most people. That said, it's best to have an experienced fitter do the measurements and make recommendations on a brand or fabric choice. The compression level for someone who does not yet have lymphedema is usually 20-30 or lower (NOT 30-40 -- more compression is not better!)  Maura, I do hope by now you've found the help you need from an experienced fitter. Ralu, your choices seem to be even fewer than Maura's, but there are some options. If there are therapists in your area who are doing lymphedema treatment, they may have experience in fitting garments, or be able to steer you to someone who can. If you aren't sure about the therapist's training, ask them. The internationally recognized standards for therapist training involve at least 135 hours full time, with one-third of the time spent in the classroom learning about the lymph system, and two-thirds in the clinic doing hands-on supervised treatment. Just to fit you for a sleeve and glove, though, takes far less training. It's possible to order on the internet. I just spoke to BandagesPlus (www.bandagesplus.com) about that, and they can take international orders, and even help you with the measurements if you call them (Toll-Free: 1-800-770-1032, M-F, 9am-6pm EST). But I'd bet Germany would have web sites able to help you as well, and the postage would no doubt be a lot less. When you find one and order it, do come back and ask if you have any questions about using them or adjusting to them, as there are lots of us here who have been through the fitting-and-adjusting process. Please let us know what you discover, both of you, as the things you experience can always be of help to the rest of us! Gentle (((hugs!))) and very happy travels! Binney ",

And now huge decisions to try to make, and more treatment to deal with. Suze, this really does end and you get your life back -- even though it sure doesn't look like it at the moment. Just like everything else you've already been through, if this is lymphedema then you have to live it one step at a time, one day at a time. Today is not the day to worry about another attempt at reconstruction, or to worry that it won't be possible either. Just for the record, and hopefully to allow you to set that whole question aside for now, surgery is possible in an area with lymphedema, but it won't cure the lymphedema. Special preparations and precautions need to be made before surgery to assure quick recovery and infection-free results, but you can deal with that when the time comes. Today's problem is to heal! Works best if you're able to relax and rest (yeah, right!), so do concentrate on taking care of you -- you're worth the time and patience it takes to move through all this at whatever pace works best for your healing (both the physical and emotional sort!) If you're suspecting truncal lymphedema, the next professional you'll want to see is a well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist. S/he'll do an evaluation by history and physical exam, take baseline measurements, answer your questions about lymphedema treatment, and help you get the immediate and long-term help you need to reduce the swelling and pain (!) and get your life back. Here's the good news: lymphedema evaluation and treatment are gentle and non-invasive. Whew!!! Here's a site for helping you find a good therapist near you. When you get names and numbers, give them a call and ask about their experience treating truncal lymphedema -- that'll give you an idea of their experience, but also of how well you can work with this person: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And in the meantime, even just temporarily so you can quickly make yourself as comfortable as possible in spite of the implant loss, here's a very friendly website developed by one of our bc.org sisters for women who are \"breastless\" by choice or by implant disaster: http://www.breastfree.org There are stories posted there by women who have gone through what you're going through, and others who decided against reconstruction from the start. There are also pages of reviews of bras and prostheses, lingerie and swimwear. And plenty of coping ideas for all the problems we're likely to encounter. Let us know how we can help, please! Plenty of (((((hugs!))))) and prayers, Binney",

But it does sound like there are lots of things going on, and they may not all be compatible. (For instance, if your shoulder problem is treated in part by applications of moist heat, that could be worsening the lymphedema that's already present.) As far as I can tell from your description, you haven't had a lymphedema Therapy Intensive, which involves daily (4 or 5 days a week) MLD and wrapping for (usually) 3 to 5 weeks. Have you been self-wrapping daily as part of your treatment? If not, it sounds like it's time to do that. Here's the National Lymphedema Network's Position Paper on Treatment, which could serve as a talking point at your next appointment: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntreatment.pdf Two other thoughts: when I was diagnosed with truncal LE it was not visible to me. My therapist felt it under my skin, and I was feeling it in terms of pain, but it was not readily visible or measurable. There can be as much as 30% more fluid in the tissues than normal before lymphedema is visible or measurable. And the other thought, which relates to that, is that some of our lymphedma research heroes, who have been using bioimpedence as well as several other diagnostic measures concurrently to measure new lymphedema in study subjects, are finding that the bioimpedence is especially unreliable. Many times even visible swelling goes undetected by bioimpedence, and other inaccuracies are occurring also. In other words, to the extent that their hesitation about your lymphedema diagnosis is based on bioimpedence measurements, they may have been misled. At any rate, don't give up now -- there's plenty of hope for relief, and hopefully it will begin very soon! Big gentle hugs and prayers for real answers! Binney",

I don't know if there are any percentage figures on lymphedema risk following prophylactic mastectomy, with or without recon.  Presumably it's low, but of course if it happens to you it's 100%. The National Lymphedema Network Risk Reduction Position Paper is here: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnriskreduction.pdf However low your risk might be, it isn't zero, so their Paper applies. That said, though, it's up to you what precautions you're want to take. Some women choose to use their prophy side because the risk is lower, particularly if it's not their dominant arm. (Lymphedema rots in either arm, but in practical terms it's harder to handle on the dominant side.) Another reason to use the prophy-side arm would be if you have a history of blood clots, in which case you might not want to use your leg for an IV. Hopefully others will be along to add information. Whatever you choose to do, I'm looking forward with you smooth sailing and quick recovery -- and no \"swell\" days ever! Binney ",

Really surprised me (in fact I tried to talk her out of it), because I knew I had chest swelling but couldn't see any arm/hard problems (there was a slight difference from my other arm, but it was my dominant side so that was expected), but she felt that the two were tied together and it would respond better to treating the arm as well. And it did, which is all I know about it. I do have LE in that arm, but it took me some time to realize it because I couldn't see it (well, and because I didn't want it, either). Her idea was that the entire quadrant (arm, hand, side, back and chest/breast on the affected side) is a single unit, for purposes of lymph drainage. So you treat it all at once in order to encourage lymph flow. Kayleigh, the arm sensations (especially aching and fullness, but really any \"funny\" feeling) can be indications of lymphedema all by themselves, without any other measurable symptoms (of course they could also possibly be your individual reaction to the chemo). Recent research evidence points toward treating women before any swelling occurs when they experience such sensations. Your PTs explanation sounds right -- when they have to break up fibrosis they do some really firm (ouchy!) massage, then do MLD to redirect the fluid. Hugs all around! Binney",

AWS can run from the axilla clear into the thumb, and on your torso down from your chest to your waist, but it doesn't necessarily run all that way, and it can't always be felt along its entire length either. Doing gentle stretching exercises in a warm (not hot!) shower may help. It usually fades out completely in a couple of months (if not sooner), but some women have repeat bouts of it. The \"cords\" you feel in AWS are made up at least partly of lymphatic tissue. Some women find PT helpful and others seem to do just fine with stretching exercises done on their own. (Some PTs \"snap\" the cord with a single motion and relieve the condition instantly, but personally I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not because of the lymphatic tissue involved.

Binney  Okay, just found this and will add it: \"Toxicity Symptoms What are toxicity symptoms for selenium? Nausea, vomiting, hair loss, skin lesions, abnormalities in the beds of the fingernails, and fingernail loss can all be symptomatic of selenium toxicity. Levels of selenium necessary to trigger these toxicity symptoms aren't usually obtained from food, since selenium-rich foods contain about 30-50 micrograms of selenium per serving. (Brazil nuts would be an exception here, since they average about 70-90 micrograms per nut). Selenium supplementation would be a more likely case of selenium toxicity than food ingestion. In light of potential toxicity risks, the National Academy of Sciences (in the year 2000) set a tolerable upper limit (UL) for selenium of 400 micrograms per day for men and women 19 years and older.\"",

You put it well.  Even at the conference, listening to enthusiastic presentations by these exercise researchers, I couldn't help thinking that they were missing something here. Yes exercise is good for us, and yes it can help prevent LE and keep it under control. But I think they're all going a bit overboard in an attempt to counteract the earlier restrictions against moving at-risk arms or lifting anything over 5 pounds or whatever (which was clearly a bad idea and needs correcting). I think there's a happy medium somewhere, though, where we're aware enough of our body that we don't overtax our arm or stress it, but that we take into account our general fitness and our own body mechanics, and move ahead carefully and safely. As an example, one of the researchers was saying that medical professionals should tell their patients to go ahead and play tennis, or whatever else they wanted to do after BC treatment. But another corrected her with the warning that if you were an avid tennis player before treatment, you should proceed very slowly to regain your earlier activity level. But if you were just taking up the sport you'd be better advised to start out slowly in the gym strenghening those muscles gently and see how that goes before tackling the tennis courts. We'll get a balance to this sooner or later -- hopefully sooner! Be well! Binney",

Actually, compression IS an option, at least at night (and during the day when you're at home). Usually, though, the kind of compression is not like the sleeves and gloves you usually see. It's a soft, stretchy fabric, doubled and stuffed with small foam chips, then \"quilted\" with special directional stitching that helps move the fluid out of the neck. Here's one example, the \"cervical collar\": http://solarismed.com/store/cart.php?m=product_list&c=10  A special, very gentle Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) massage is also possible. My therapist did the neck/face MLD massage on me once and it was heavenly -- so relaxing it almost made me weep (I'm not kidding!) I've used it sometimes on my autistic son because it calms him down so thoroughly. You'll be able to learn to do it to yourself too. It moves fluid out of the head and neck and directs it to other working nodes. Daytime compression of the head and neck is usually not needed if you're doing some MLD too, as gravity is a help to draining those areas during the day. jrb, prayers for just the right therapist and quick relief -- and real healing.

Instead, mine says: \"No needles, no BP, either arm.\" (My lymphedema is bilateral, so I wear a necklace instead of a bracelet.) There are other medical reasons to avoid arms besides lymphedema that medical folks are more likely to be careful of, so I don't want to give them any leeway for deciding for themselves how important my lymphedema is. Before I developed lymphedema, and when I had it only in one arm, I always wore my bracelet to remind ME not to offer the wrong arm. Now it's so ingrained I snarl immedately if anyone even looks at my arm when they have a needle or BP cuff in their hand. (I never seem to have an ink pen handy to poke their eyes out like Suzy does. So much for \"Be prepared\"!) Be well! Binney",

If new doc doesn't work out, the fact is most of us manage just fine with our regular medical team -- you just have to find the one who's sympathetic and either willing to learn about LE, or willing to write whatever you ask her for. My onc's office couldn't write a passable LE script to save their lives (much less mine!), so I offered them an patient-led in-service, which they graciously accepted. I wrote to every garment company I could find (day and night garments both) and told them what I was doing and asked for samples, fabric swatches, and brochures. Got loads of \"show and tell\" materials and made up packets for all the staff. I took in my own garments as well, so they finally had a realistic idea of what I deal with. They honestly had never seen a night garment (when you think about it, why would they?), had no clue there were so many options, got excited about the various fabrics, and (probably predictably) fell in love with the LympheDivas. Magically, I can now get a script written flawlessly, and when anyone has to fight their insurance for LE supplies, the staff there already know why they need a certain item. It is A LOT OF WORK, and we shouldn't have to do this, but I learned a lot and it's saved me a world of hassle. It was scary to suggest it to them, but the garment companies are very helpful (it's to their advantage, obviously!), so it worked out really well As far as wrapping goes, if your fingers are wrapped it can be frustrating to use door knobs or handle things like jelly jars, because your hand slips. When the wrap first goes on it's dismaying, but as you work at bending and using your arm it does loosen up enough so you can function nearly normally (given some adjustments like rubber gloves around water). Here's the StepUp-SpeakOut section on coping while wrapped: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/How_You_Can_Cope_with_Lymphedema.htm#Wrapped_Arm Keep us posted! Binney",

Other points to remember are to wear warm mittens to avoid swollen hands from chilling and then thawing them; stay well hydrated all the time you're exercising (hard to remember on the slopes, but extremely important); and STOP at once if your arm feels tired or stressed. That last point is SO HARD to do, but with a compromised lymph system we really need to pay attention to clues like that in order to stay well. Getting towed uphill by your arm is NOT a good idea, so if there's another way up, take it. Afterward, avoid the hot tub or sauna and opt for a cup of cocoa instead! A good overview of risk reduction ideas is available in the Position Paper section of the National Lymphedema Network web site, here: www.lymphnet.org There's one about Risk Reduction, another about Exercise, and still another on Plane Travel.

I use them for flares but find I don't wear them regularly. The glove rots--just my opinion--so I ordered regular day-time gloves in black to wear with it (the oversleeve on the Juxtafit is black). I sure wouldn't recommend them to anyone who wasn't experienced in wrapping, but that's a no-brainer for you. Every time you don them you adjust the fit, so if you don't have a good grasp of what gradient compression is and what it feels like this just seems like an accident waiting to happen. I don't exercise in them because they're not easily washable. If your elbow area is a particular swelling problem that could be an issue. They have a removable strap at the elbow that provides extra flexibility, but of course if you remove it there's a gap there. Haven't been able to figure that one out. I don't have elbow swelling, but I don't want any either, so I wear the strap over the elbow area. On the other hand, I find them fairly comfortable, and the adjustability is a major advantage in a flare or when my arm hurts. So I'm really glad I have them, I suspect they'll last really well, and even if they're bulkier than a regular daytime sleeve they're fairly flexible and very supportive. For women with a dependent arm or problems donning a regular sleeve they're a real prize. They can be day or night garments, which is a plus as well. And finally, oddly enough I don't get funny looks or questions when I wear them like I sometimes do with regular day garments. I have no idea why. Maybe because they look more like a tennis elbow or carpal tunnel brace and less like a disastrous fashion mistake. If you get one I'll be interested to know how you like it!  Be well! Binney",

Unfortunately nurses (and doctors) aren't well trained about lymphedema, so lots of us have gotten misinformation. Lymphedema can occur at any time following bc treatment, and once it shows up it's for life. Considering all you're dealing with, and the loved ones who depend on you for their care (not to mention the sport you love), you sure don't need to add this risk to what you're already facing. But it's not easy to protect your arms when you're in a hospital. Our major problems involve the recovery area (some of us warned all the surgery staff off our arms only to awaken in recovery with a bp cuff pumping away on our arm) and being in a hospital room. Nurses tend to grab whichever arm is handy, even if there's a sign posted over your bed (which there should be, by the way!), and the lab folks come through in the dark of night while you're zonked on pain killers and miss the sign altogether. One thing that works fairly well is to write  all over your arms with a permanent marker (it comes off later with alcohol). I write RESTRICTED EXTREMITY all up my arms, then NO BP HERE on my upper arm and NO IV on the back of my hands and crook of my elbow. If you can get your surgeon to sign your arm after you write it, that's even better. (Although breast surgeons and plastic surgeons are not always well-informed about the risk of lymphedema, strange as that may seem). Toward the bottom of the following web page there are sections about standing up to medical personnel, what to do if your lymphedema risk is bilateral, and guidelines for surgery in an area with lymphedema (or at risk for lymphedema): http://stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm And here's a page you can copy off to give to your doctors/nurses to help them understand the risk: http://stepup-speakout.org/what_we_need_healthcare_providers_to_know_about_lymphedema.htm After your surgery you might insist on a referral (from any doctor on your team) to a lymphedema therapist. S/he will do an evaluation, measure both arms for future reference, give you some personalized risk-reduction tips, and fit you for sleeves and gloves you can wear for traveling and exercise. S/he can also guide your return to full use of your arm in a way that protects it, important when your sport is so arm-dependent. Here's a page about finding a well-qualified lymphedema therapist near you: http://stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And here are two good references for actions you can take to reduce your lymphedema risk: http://www.lymphnet.org  (see their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel) http://stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm More information than you wanted, yes? So, short answer: don't let them near either arm! I'll be thinking of you on Monday -- please come let us know how it goes as soon as you're able.

Even if it turns out to be something much simpler than lymphedema, it's really a bummer to have to even think about it after all this time. Lymphedema in the hand and arm isn't usually outright painful, though it sure as heck doesn't feel good! Could you be dealing with a sprain or fracture? On the other hand, it sure could be lymphedema, and a well-trained lymphedema therapist would be able to evaluate this for you, hopefully very soon. Any doctor on your team will do for a referral, even your PCP. So if you can get in to any of them sooner than that, it'd sure help. In the meantime, elevation should help, for sure. Drink plenty, keep your hand out of hot water (a long soaky bath, a spa, dishwater), and try not to use it much until you can get help. Keep a close eye on it for any sign of infection (redness, warmth to the touch, fever, itching) and get help immediately if you any of those develop. Phooey! Do keep us posted.

To qualify, a therapist must have taken at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond their PT, OT, MT, RN, DO, or MD certification, one-third of that time in bookwork and two-thirds hands-on, and have a least a year's experience treating LE, and pass the LANA written test (and pay the fee to do that.) It's great. Every LE therapist should have to do this. But no state in the U.S. requires it. Yet. I hope they will soon, but laws to that effect are opposed by the PT and OT unions and their very influential lobbyists (sigh!). The LANA website is here: www.clt-lana.org, and it has a listing of all LANA certified therapists, so that's a list worth checking too. But because the states don't require LANA certification, neither do the insurance companies, SO there's no particular motivation for even well-qualified therapists to sit for the test (and pay for it, see?) My own therapist is well-trained, does educational up-grades regularly, and has years of experience. But she won't register with LANA because she's already swamped with patients and doesn't want to be listed on their web site because she doesn't want any more patients on her waiting list (which is currently three months long). I argue with her about that, because I think it's only fair we should be able to find good therapists easily, but I can see her point. (Kind of.) All of which is why I always end up typing out the requirements for us lymphers to insist on (the 135 hours, etc.) instead of just being able to send everyone who needs a therapist to the LANA site.  I just can't seem to answer a simple question with a simple answer! But I hope it helps, anyway, Binney ",

In fact, you can have early-stage lymphedema with no visible or measurable swelling (it's called pre-clinical lymphedema). That's because there can be 30% more fluid than normal in your arm (or other area) before it becomes measurable. Early signs of lymphedema might include heaviness or aching or just a \"funny\" feeling in the arm. So, really good that you've caught this early! Carpal tunnel could certainly be a risk factor for lymphedema. Any pain draws lymph fluid to the area--it's part of your body's emergency response to any pain or injury. With a lymph system compromised by surgery and node removal, the extra fluid can trigger lymphedema as the damaged system struggles (unsuccessfully!) with the increased fluid accumulation. Having carpal tunnel may make lymphedema worse, depending on the pain level and how much energy you're willing to put in to control it. But that's probably an individual issue, as we're all different. Do get help soon. Here's information on lymphedema treatment: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/treatments_for_lymp... Please tell us how we can help! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Compression sleeves are usually not necessary when you're swimming, and may create problems as they tighten when wet, so if you're going to try using old sleeves do be mindful of that too as a potential issue. Old sleeves can really vary in how stretched out they are, so they can easily become too restrictive in water (especially with motion). Some strokes are more of a problem than others--you might do some experimenting to see which affect you and in what ways. A lot of this is trial and error, so keeping notes about exercise, diet, and weather might be helpful in tracking down exactly what's causing you grief. Keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Jogging is fairly mindless, so I can think about other things while I'm doing it (or even talk on the phone, as Kira can tell you, since I was puffing a bit during our last call), and since I'm doing this in the house lots of things get picked up and put away as I jog by, that I'd otherwise not get around to. Also, one of our dogs loves jogging along with me, so he gets some exercise too (this is not convenient, especially in the narrow hallway where he tends to run me into the wall. Ah, well!)

It's the order, pace and precision of that routine that affects the lymph flow, which in turn helps reduce swelling and pain. Which is why it's hard for me to figure out why I balk at doing it. It's more effective for me than self-mld, which is too easy to rush or to apply too much pressure. Hope that helps! Binney",

After that most have to wrap at night (or wear equally bulky but much more managable night garments). Most of us also have to wrap when something sets off more swelling, or to prevent new swelling when we're travelling or doing heavier work. That's why learning how to do it ourselves is an important skill, not to mention a major accomplishment. I think we should get a diploma or something!

For some, it recruits more than it moves out, and in that case you have to re-figure what you're doing. So exercise is never out of the picture for anyone, but how much and what kind (and maybe even when) will differ from person to person. Most of the women who started the PAL study were able to finish it. But those whose LE was hard to keep stable never even started it, and some of those who started dropped out because they couldn't handle it without flaring. All of those can benefit from exercise, but it might be walking, jogging, tai chi, modified yoga, bike riding, swimming--or several of the sections of Lebed. Starting slow, monitoring, and working up slowly are key to any kind of exercise for us lymphers. And then, as Dawne-Hope points out, maybe once in a while we choose to break out of our usual precautions and just plan to regroup later. We all have lives to live, and we need to do what makes that worthwhile. JMHO, Binney",

On the other hand, we also have a compelling reason to learn it, so...onward anyhow! It gets easier, honest, Bonnie",

My fitter, who works for Bio-Concepts, says I can put the sleeves and gloves in the dryer on a cool setting, but they're so easy to hang out I don't bother. The short-stretch bandages I roll up wet, just to get them smoothed out, then I unroll them over the shower bar and let them hang dry. The gauze is more trouble. I smooth it inch by inch over the rounded metal back bar of a kitchen stool then hang them nice and straight over the shower bar. I've heard of women ironing the gauze with a coolish iron, but that's way above and beyond for me! Otter, it'll be good! Binney ",

There are a number of pneumatic pumps on the market, and several of the women here on the boards have them and use them successfully. Flexitouch on Lymphapress are two of the companies. But the machine won't do all the work for you -- just help with the self-massage. You'll still need to do part of the massage yourself, wrap and wear compression garments as needed, exercise, and all the other things you mentioned. It can be hard to find a fitter who knows what they're doing! Here's a page with information on how to know if the fit (and the fitter!) is right: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm It really sounds like you're doing lots for yourself. When your arm feels heavy try to elevate it as much as you can, even on a pillow at night if you can do that. It can also help then to do the wrapping you learned. Stay well hydrated -- it's especially hard to remember to drink enough throughout the day when the weather is cool, so you have to find ways to remind yourself. Another thing that helps is stopping to take a few deep abdominal breaths throughout the day, as that stimulates the lymph system and keeps things moving. Please keep us posted on how it goes with the machine. The companies are supposed to train you to use it correctly, so insist on getting the help you need with it. I hope you find it both helpful with the lymphedema, and wonderfully relaxing! (((((Hugs!))))), Binney",

When I shortcut, I tend to concentrate on whichever arm is acting up at the moment. But Darleen and I went to a support group meeting last week where a U. of A. LE reseacher was speaking. One of the things they're studying is the effectiveness of massage, and all the parts of the massage. They did find that the full massage (neck and groin nodes, body, then arm) is the most effective way to do it. Then they looked at whether just doing the arm would work. It did practically nothing. Finally, they looked at just doing the neck/groin/body part without the arm and --ta-da! -- that was almost (but not quite) as effective as the full massage. Sooooo -- looks like if the time is short, the part to do is the node clearing and chest/side/back whatever, rather than the stupid swollen limb. Conclusion: nothing about LE makes any sense at all. Aren't we lucky to have researchers to uncover this craziness for us?! Other research news: In Belgium they're working on determining if there are genetic links to the development of post-bc LE. That would help explain why somebody has 67 nodes removed does cartwheels with her grandkids and never gets LE, while someone else has a single node removed, sits on silk cushions all day and watches her arm blow up like a blimp. Maybe some day those at extra genetic risk will even have preventive measures they can use to avoid LE entirely. (YES!!!) Also, one of their therapists down in Tucson is using custom compression garments (plus massage therapy of course) instead of bandaging (which no one in the Tucson desert cares to do from about May to October). She teaches her patients how to take in the seam on their sleeve every two weeks, which increases the compression gradually and compensates for the stretching that comes from wear. So there you go -- all the research results that are fit to print! Or at least that I remember. Darleen, have you got anything you can add? Binney Log in to post a reply",

The reason I like the Lebed is because you can do it sitting down and still get good effect from it. And it's slow, too -- all good. You can start with the first section of the DVD or the first video online and work up from there, so it's also an easy way to get back into some therapeutic movement. Tina, goodness, I hurt for you! Five hours, huh? That translates into about 20-25 times re-rolling the lousy bandages, yes? Do you have a bandage roller? I'd have been crying and flinging bandages long before that--you qualify for sainthood! I sure hope you're doing something soothing for yourself today--LE means we have to care for our emotional well-being right along with the physical. Do something chocolate, yes? Carol, that \"little voice of LE reason\" is indeed very little, especially when I'm engaged in a project. I find myself not stopping, but instead rushing to get it done before that \"little voice\" gets any louder. Later on, of course, it's screaming, but by then it's too late. If somebody wants to develop a little-voice-of-LE-reason amplifier I'd love to buy one. Name your price! <sigh!> Binney",

But you're sure wise to be asking these questions.  Best bet is to get a referral now to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for evaluation, baseline arm measurements, and personalized risk reduction tips. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Here are some general risk reduction guidelines you'll want to know about if you don't already: http://www.lymphnet.org  (See their Position Papers) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm I hope there are other MTs who can respond to your concerns, though I don't recall any who have mentioned it. We do have a lot of women with careers that involve their affected arms though -- artists, musicians, factory workers, hair-dressers, nurses, doctors, ranchers, moms with small kids. So there will be many who can share your concerns and hopefully offer suggestions. Especially with kids you want to do all you can to fight the bc beast right from the start. The good news is that with proper care and oversight you can do that and also do the best possible to protect your arm. Tell us how we can help! Binney",

Compression garments can help you keep the swelling down, but the massage and wrapping are important for reducing it in the first place (and later on in case of flares). When you're ready for compression garments, here's a page about proper fitting of them, as many of us have had problems getting good help with that aspect. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm Aly, this really is hard to get your mind around, and it takes time and patience. If your therapist is well-qualified s/he can really help you get it under control and learn the self-care you need to keep it that way. Once you have the skills you need, you really will feel back in control of your life. In the meantime, please do keep us posted on your progress, and feel free to come rant as necessary.

Many malls offer that time for walkers. It's safe, cool, no traffic stops, and you can window browse before the crowds hit. We've made a lot of casual friends among the people who walk there regularly, and for the last several years we've all had a monthly get-together in the food court where we recognize birthdays and anniversaries, have a sing-along and some refreshments. Nice! Our mall is all on one level, but if yours has stairs that's even better. Another plus: because we get there before the crowds we can park in one of those few spaces that offer some shade, so when we come out to the car it's not blazing hot. They frown on jogging in the mall, but we have several speed walkers, and that's fine. Just a thought, Binney",

That's the standard protocol. The National Lymphedema Network has Position Papers, one of which describes treatment. You might copy that off and take it with you next time and ask her to clarify with you why she's not doing the wrapping. It is extremely effective, and the idea is for the therapist to do it for you during treatment, so the fact that you can't do it yourself is beside the point. And I'm with you: wasting time (and money, and PT visits) trying out some lesser treatment seems like a frustration just waiting to happen. Here's the NLN site -- their Position Papers are listed on the right-hand side of the page near the bottom: http://www.lymphnet.org On the other hand, if you talk to her about this variation from the standard and her reasoning makes sense to you, then by all means go with it. She's trained, presumably she's experienced, and there may be great reasons for her plan. But the plan and goals of therapy should always be something YOU agree with, not something foisted on you, so it's best to be clear about it from the start. Yes! to the night garment!

Looking at it, I can tell you that treatment options will likely include chemo and possibly radiation, and you need to know right off the bat that these are doable. Recent advances in treating side effects make the whole process more managable than it used to be. Again, the women here will help you and your friend at every step.

Okay, what I was trying to say earlier without actually saying it is: before you order a custom chest compression garment, do check in here, because the general run of experiences with the custom chest stuff is, uh, not real positive. If you ask me, it would not be an insurmountable problem for some compression garment company to come up with great design ideas in a lovely fabric that can address the various problem areas we have with truncal LE. (But then, nobody's asking me, are they?!) The issue you're talking about where the panel between the cups forms a bridge is, cleverly enough, actually called \"bridging.\" It's difficult to address, but it shouldn't be impossible, and smooshing everything together into one unattractive \"loaf\" shouldn't be necessary either. Cleavage, you garment designer people!!! Nevermind, they'll get around to it one of these days, if only because we all keep after them. Together we can make a difference!

You could ask your therapist about other options as well, that you can cut to shape yourself from a sheet. I use \"chocolate bars\" sometimes, when I need something more aggressive than a Swell Spot. There's \"spaghetti foam\" too. The sheets of these products are expensive, but since you cut smallish pieces of them one sheet could last years.  You can buy everything online. Look over the Solaris site (and you could check the JoviPak site too, if you don't mind searching through their stupid \"bubble\" homepage) and decide what you want and then go comparison shopping at the various LE suppliers.

Anything made of foam can cause skin irritation if it's directly on the skin, so I wrap my foam shape thingys in a bit of stockinette.  Swell Spots (and night garments) are stuffed with medical grade chipped foam pieces, which you can buy by the bag at places like Bandages Plus: http://www.bandagesplus.com/prd/152/783/Foam-Chip-Bag.html Lots of therapists stitch up their own swell-spot-like items for specific applications. (And appropriately enough, they call them \"chip bags\".) So can you. Faux doe-skin fabric is nice, or any fabric that feels soft and very pliable against your skin (and since we're talking about very small quantities needed, the price-per-yard isn't much of an issue). You might want to check your design with your therapist so you're certain the directional stitching goes in the right direction for the intended area. Do let us know what you come up with! Binney",

That makes sense, because if compression works to reduce swelling, and it reduces the swelling inside the bandages, then the compression is going to be less. None of us wrap every 8 hours, usually (I've done it when I had a flare and was in panic mode, but it's really not necessary.) Most of us do a 24-hour wrap, take a shower, lotion, MLD and re-wrap. IF you and your husband are good at wrapping, by all means do that. If you're not, talk to your therapist about scheduling four or five days a week (which is standard protocol, by the way). Carol, there are lymphedema hospitals in Germany and Austria that have just about everything you've mentioned. There they DO massage and wrap every eight hours, everyone eats healthy meals together, and there are both exercise rooms and planned outdoor activities. They're in absolutely gorgeous settings and the facilities are resort-like. You can bring a friend or spouse to learn and enjoy the experience along with you. It's not free. Nitocris corresponds with the folks at this one (isn't that right, Nitocris?): http://www.lymphedema-clinic.com/ We could all just meet there, yes? No, huh? <sigh!> Binney",

The good news is that if the cortisone works it'll be good for your LE, because pain draws more lymph fluid and makes things harder to control. So, yeah! Stop that pain! In the same way, if you wear your compression garments and it hurts, take it off. If not, it should help, because excess lymph fluid sitting around stagnating is not a natural thing and does not promote healing.  The danger with a shot into an area with LE is partly the added pain drawing more lymph fluid, and partly the opportunity for infection, even in a medical setting. So if you're wearing garments, do remove them every few hours and check the skin on your entire arm and hand (use a mirror) to be sure there's no unexplained redness. Sure hope this does the trick to deal with the pain. Get well quick! Binney",

So I turn the little temp dial to low and turn it on. For two sleeves and a full vest, and assorted Swell Spots, It takes about an hour and a half. The inside always has a spot or two of still-damp areas, so I do this early in the day and then turn them partly inside out and let that part air dry. I keep three clean tennis balls to toss in with them and with a few towels, and the balls help fluff them up. I've gone much longer than a week without washing them, but that's not a good idea, since washing them restores the firm compression. On the other hand, I hate the first night after they're washed because they feel so much tighter, so I always try to wash them when the next day isn't going to depend on me being really well rested. It is important to do a double rinse to get all the soap residue out -- that (they tell me) can extend the life of the garment. And since all mine have zippers, I have to make sure those are closed and the sleeve top is folded down to cover the moving parts. (Why zippers? I have a vest and two sleeve/gloves that attach to the vest with snaps. So in case of a middle of the night bathroom run, the only way to get my hand out without completely undressing is to have a zipper. It is also much better for other, uh, nighttime activities. As an added bonus, putting them on with a zipper does not involve bashing myself in the mouth. So, why don't they make all night garments with zippers? I have no idea.) Hope that makes sense.

At all. First off, is just your arm wrapped, or did she wrap your hand as well? If your hand is NOT wrapped, and if it is starting to hurt, DO remove the wrap now before it pushes fluid into your hand, and either call and tell her, or (better yet) look around for another LE-trained therapist for a \"second opinion.\" If your hand IS wrapped and it's starting to hurt, call the therapist and tell her that. You really don't want to risk fluid trapped in your hand. The point of wrapping is to provide an external pressure in order to promote lymph movement WHEN YOU'RE USING YOUR MUSCLES. In other words, exercise is ESSENTIAL when you're wrapped. There are many therapists who don't teach self-MLD (massage), because they believe we won't do it correctly or consistently, but there are many others who will, and it's a great skill to have. Another reason to look for that \"second opinion.\" As for asking your doctors what to do about blood draws, injections, blood pressure and such, that's a good place to start, but do remember that your arms are yours, LE is for life, and the final (educated, of course) decision about how best to use them is yours. I have no idea why she's telling you there will be no improvement, especially since you see improvement when you swim so you know it's possible. Also, the restriction on lifting is certainly not the current understanding about LE management, though working up to lifting very S-L-O-W-L-Y is important, and it would be helpful (understatement!) if you had a therapist who was able to assist you with that. Brava for your careful research and self-advocacy! Hang in there! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Today, though, DD was baking brownies, so my jogs through the kitchen too often involved taste-testing. Gotta come up with an alternate route... Binney",

I gave up crocheting because I HATED stopping after 10 minutes, but other activities work out okay. Like gardening, for instance--I can work at weeding for awhile, switch to watering or potting, then go back to weeding. Some projects, though, aren't as easy to switch, and crocheting is unfortunately one of those. Heat is a trigger for me, for sure, so working like that outside would be problematic. I get up early in the summer so I can work outside comfortably (or at least relatively comfortably!) and plan indoor activities for later in the day. I'd say dealing with LE is more a matter of strategizing than giving everything up. Not all bad, at that, since it means being better organized. But it sure is a huge life adjustment, and brava to you for the efforts you're making to take good care of YOU!!! Gentle hugs, Binney ",

Hugs, chocolate, and lots more good wishes coming your way! Here's a page about surgery (or other invasive procedures) in an area with LE. Not much there you don't already know, but it might be reassuring (scroll to the very bottom of the page): http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm If you're not sure of your garment fit it's best not to wear them for this procedure -- you won't be awake or alert enough to notice if they're causing you trouble. Instead make sure everybody knows NOT to use that arm for anything (write that on it with a permanent marker -- comes off later with alcohol) and have your doctor write it in the orders as well. There's a free neon-pink alert band available here: http://www.lymphedema.com  (Make a note to them that you need this ASAP, and they're usually extremely helpful and responsive.) Instead of garments, stay as well hydrated as they'll let you before the procedure, and for several days after. Keep your arm elevated (pillows) for the day following and until you feel like it's under reasonable control. Pause from time to time to take deep abdominal breaths (stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies). Do whatever you can to get good sleep (easier said than done!) For now, gentle head and neck stretches may help. Do you have the Lebed exercise DVD? That one has slow opening exercises that are wonderful for the shoulder-to-ear connection that we all know too well. Very ouch! Please keep us posted, and tell us how we can help.

But the good news is if it's lymphedema (LE), it's early stage and will be much easier to treat and keep in control. The specialist you want to see is a fully-trained LE therapist. That means at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond his/her PT or OT certification, and preferably a year's experience treating LE. (Call and make sure before you go, because there are no state laws yet enforcing any training standards for LE therapists.) Here's a web site with a Therapist Locator for finding a well-qualified therapist near you: www.mylymphedema.com   For information on Therapist Training and on what you can expect from Therapy, see the Position Papers at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org  Any member of your medical team can write a referral, so if one wants you to wait until your arm is as big as a tree trunk, go to another. Even if it turns out that it's not LE, a therapist can measure your arms for a baseline for future reference, teach you a gentle lymph massage you can use prophylactically to help prevent it, and give you tips about skin care and risk reduction. Altogether a very good thing. Please let us know what you discover. And let us know how we can help! Be well, Binney ",

While your friend is sitting there next to you (probably eating her heart out about the massage, yes?), have her take some notes and then try doing it for you with the therapist's guidance. With back swelling it really helps to have someone knowledgeable to help with the massage. I'm sure curious about the new sort of sleeve you mentioned and hope others will come along who are using one. You're talking about a day garment, right, not a night sleeve? Do you know who the maker is? The only over-the-shoulder sleeves I've ever tried are the sort made with thin straps that cross your chest and back. They're strictly a way to keep the sleeve up instead of using a silicone band. Because you adjust them and fasten them yourself, they don't have any set compression, and if you fastened them tight enough to make a difference in compressing the shoulder, you'd risk cutting off the lymph flow on your back, chest and opposite side. Not real helpful! Until now, the only way to add compression for the shoulder has been with a full vest (which I hate) that has short sleeves. So I'm anxious to hear what this one is like and how it works out for you. And by the way, I love your cheery spirit. You rock! Joanne, that's a great service the hospital offers, and it's always so good to hear that someone has noticed our needs and done something about it. Thanks for posting that. Be well, all! Binney ",

The treatment of LE in Thailand is similar in some ways, with compression applied for shorter periods of time during the therapy session itself, though there's no salt water involved. But in the Western world what you're describing is a looooong way from standard treatment.

That sounds like a good idea, but what we know about cancer tumors is that they require both blood vessels and lymph vessels in order to grow and thrive. So encouraging new vessel growth may help with LE, but it may also encourage tumor growth. We just don't know that yet. There's other research being proposed with a different lymphangiogenesis agent called Lymfactin (it too has been studied on mouse tails and rabbit ears, but not on humans), but the FDA will not allow that study to happen in the U.S. because of that risk.  Just a thought.

An experienced LE therapist can usually diagnose it by med history and physical exam, as they know what it feels like under the skin. Some docs want to do doppler or other imaging of the arm first, to rule out a blood clot or other blockage, but generally an evaluation by the therapist is the way you reach both the diagnosis and the stage. So you want a referral soon, and you want a well-trained therapist. You may have no trouble getting the referral, but if you do, you can always insist. Nicely, of course ! Yeah, cancer treatment is pretty dramatic, isn't it? No-holds-barred! But then, bc is a formidable foe... So glad you're moving forward, Joanne. It'll be good! Binney ",

Call up any and all therapists who are on your plan and claim to do LE therapy, and ask them: Where they were trained How many hours of specifically LE training they received How long they've been practicing If they're LANA certified  Then if any of them meet the 135-hour requirement but were trained at another school, that's your best bet. If none of them have the requisite training, consider appealing your insurance. It takes a few weeks and some paperwork, but it may well be worth the effort, since a therapist is a long-term relationship, and you want one you can trust. Let us know what you discover and how it goes! Hello, Laura! LE can start in just your thumb, but there are other possibilities too. AIs can cause joint problems that can result in swelling, for one thing. It's a good idea to keep LE in mind as a possibility when you're talking to your doc about your thumb swelling, but I'm hoping it's something much more easily managed! Be well! Binney ",

Because lymphedema is not treated with drugs or surgery, our doctors and nurses are often not real familiar with it, and sometimes they're slow to act.

Althea, there's no clinical evidence that rebounding helps upper extremity LE, but lots of anecdotal evidence that it helps leg LE. On the other hand, there are a lot of perfectly reliable women here with arm and chest LE who swear by it, and I can vouch for the fact that even aerobic dance on the floor helps my LE. So I'm inclined to believe that, since the whole lymph system basically works together, it's reasonable to believe rebounding on a regular basis would be good for you. (Assuming of course that you don't fall off and hit the floor!) I believe LindaLou does something or other with her arms as she bounces, and hopefully she'll be along soon to tell us what that is, exactly. It's possible that leaving them hanging while you bounce wouldn't be a real good idea. In answer to your question, bottom line is, with no research available most therapists stay away from recommending it for upper body LE. I sure wish I could do it -- sounds like fun! Binney ",

Hmmm, it that reminds me I have some Trader Joe's dark chocolate-covered blueberries in the cupboard. I remain bummed (or should that be \"bugged\") over this new area flare, but I'm back to walking and dog training (lots of exercise there!) and Lebed. No jogging yet because I wonder how much that may have contributed to this (of couse the cracked rib and lying around with the flu didn't help any). What's causing me despair is the fact that this is my left chest, and ever since this flare started it hurts when I type, even though most of the swelling is down now. I have a left-hand-only keyboard that I had to learn to use because when I type right-handed my arm/hand/chest swell on that side. Does this mean I have to start looking for a toe-only keyboard?!!

The bc (which was diagnosed in 2001) was a long haul to get through, but while doing so I couldn't handle bc.org -- just didn't want to hear anyone else's woes, I guess. I had a good team of docs and trusted them, they listened to me and got me all the information I needed. But when the LE hit they were clueless, and I found myself amazingly alone with a serious chronic medical condition and no help at all. So I came here looking for other women who might have answers. Just to show you how upset I was, when I first signed in I was Binney1, but somehow I got signed out, forgot my password and ended up re-registering as Binney2. That time I carefully wrote my password down, lost the paper I wrote it on, and soon became Binney3. And so on. I have been Binney4 for many years, mainly because I never sign out anymore. Otherwise by this time I'd be Binney5687. But of course any day I could morph into Binney5 -- watch for it! When I joined there were only a few forums here, and you could easily read every post on the entire bc.org site every day. (Hard to imagine now!) I started asking about LE and, though there was no one else diagnosed with it, there were several other women with \"mysteriously\" swollen arms who were as amazed as I was that the swelling had a name, much less a way to treat it. Outrageous! We asked for our own forum and the mods gave it to us, and it's appalling to find that almost eight years later there are STILL women elsewhere on these boards who have no idea why their arm or breast is swollen. But now they have this safe place to land, because all of you are here to catch them -- and to catch them up on what they need to know! THANK YOU, ALL for being here for me! Binney",

I got up with my chest still hurting (both sides) and for some reason wrapping my arm seemed like a good idea. I thought about it and couldn't think of a single reason why wrapping my ARM would make my CHEST feel better, but it still seemed good, so I did it. The relief was almost instant, and I've been typing all morning with no further pain. (Except on my right side, which is not unusual. So I just went and wrapped that arm too and am hoping it'll help. We'll see.) I'm wearing a Solaris night vest with a chocolate bar (the foam kind) stuffed under the right side, and have both arms wrapped, so I haven't been doing much activity. But of course exercising while wrapped is especially helpful for the swelling, so I'm going to quit typing and go for a walk. Maybe I'll even jog, but not real likely. Slow and easy! I have to keep reminding myself the tortoise won. Stupid LE! Binney Edited to add: Oh, wait! I almost forgot! I get credit for doing Lebed this morning too -- and I need all the credit I can get.",

Purple, the explanation is probably lost several pages back--since I seem to destroy pedometers with alarming (and expensive) frequency, I gave up on them. Instead I counted the steps in a loop around my house (70, to be exact), and I keep a bowl of corks at one end of this indoor route so I can drop them into another bowl one by one with each round. I have 70 corks, which adds up to almost 5,000 steps, so if I do it twice it gets me just about to 10,000 and they all end up back in the original container. Keeps me honest. Very primitive pedometer, for people prone to drop, lose, dunk or otherwise destroy modern technology. Corks bounce, float, and even throwing them into the washer doesn't hurt them. If you lose one, you can replace it next time there's an empty wine bottle. What's not to like?! Be well, Binney",

But as for MLD, I haven't been doing it for some time because I developed LE in my right leg and was then unsure of where to \"send\" the fluid from the upper quadrants. SO! I finally started a therapy intensive for my leg this week with my amazing Therapist Jane, and though I find it, uh, constraining to be back in treatment, I have to say it's a huge relief, and Therapist Jane assures me this will be a relatively easy fix. Fortunately she's both experienced and inventive, so she's come up with my very own \"designer MLD pattern.\" Between frustration and relief I feel like an emotional yo-yo, so the jogging and corking continues to be a big help. I am SO GRATEFUL for Therapist Jane, and just want to encourage everyone again to land somewhere with a therapist they trust, because you never know when you'll need an arm to lean on. <sigh!> Binney",

So depending on how your own body handles that balance, certain exercises can be either helpful or troublesome. Some women here have reported recently that being sick in bed, they were surprised to find they didn't swell even though they weren't wearing compression. So their lack of exercise made their LE easy to control. So is lack of exercise good for you? Of course not. Finding the kind of exercise your own body can handle is, though. Some media releases about the PAL weight-lifting trials made it sound like all of us should be out there lifting weights. In fact, Katie Schmitz discovered that there are some women who flared from weight lifting no matter how gradually they started and how well they were supervised, and she wisely dropped them from her study. Which sure doesn't mean those women should go home and become rooted. It means they need to look further to find what works for them. Bottom line, we all need exercise. And the good news is, there's something for everyone, even if you have to do a bit of searching to find it. Hmmm, you could always try cork tossing.... Be well! Binney",

Call the company and see what their time limit is so you don't miss out. Can you move the therapist appointment up? Meet her on her lunch hour (sometimes they'd rather not schedule for a brief consult because there's so much paperwork involved for a full appointment)? If not, at least call the company and tell them you have an unavoidable delay in assessing the fit of your garment. I hate be the one to say this, but that up-and-down that goes on with the day garment/wrapping really is not ideal (but you already knew that). Anytime there's excess fluid in the arm/hand it increases both the infection risk and the mess-up of tissue inside (fat deposition, fibrosis, inflammation). So the quicker you can get the adjustments made the better. It obviously isn't right for you now, so needs a remake. Bummer! Binney",

      "Content": "May 6, 2013 01:31PM - edited May 6, 2013 01:32PM by Binney4 fgm, hello! A few things to think about: The arms need to be IN the water--doesn't work to stand in the water and keep your shoulders out. Water sets up extra resistance, so hard and repetitious pulling through the water can really stress your arm and exacerbate the LE. You'll want to be gentle with your arms and build up very gradually to more vigorous activity. One of our gals here was advised by her doctor to use water exercise for her LE. She got in the pool and treaded water for half an hour and her arm ballooned. Water's great for LE, but we still have to be gentle as we build endurance and strength. Your swim suit may be restricting lymph flow, either at the axilla or under the breast area. Too narrow a shoulder strap can be a problem also. Swim suit fit is critical, especially for breast/chest LE, because you're using your arm in a wider range than you do in ordinary activities, but we don't always think about it. Staying hydrated whenever we exercise is really important, but easy to forget when you're wallowing in the water. Keep a supply of drinking water handy and remind yourself to drink often. Exercise is good! Water exercise is excellent! Do talk to your instructor about the personal adjustments you need to make to her routines. You might want to share the exercise guidelines with her: stepup-speakout.org/Trainer%20... stepup-speakout.org/Handout%20... Do let us know how it goes! Binney",

This page has some suggestion for surgery on an area with LE--scroll down to the very last section on the page: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Med... If your MIL has a good LE therapist, you might request that your surgeon consult with her/him before surgery. The brachial plexopathy does complicate things a bit because it's harder to clear the fluid from a dependent arm, as muscle action is the prime mover of lymph fluid, but it shouldn't interfere with the surgery.

I'm an in-house walker, so I counted the steps it takes me to cover my \"route\" from library to dining room to kitchen to hallway to bedroom and around my bed to the far corner and back again. And at one end of the route I placed a plastic mixing bowl and a bag full of old wine corks I've been saving for a few years (to make a bulletin board out of, actually, but of course I've never gotten around to it). Every time I finish a circuit of my route I toss a cork into the bowl, and at the end of the day count them, multiply by the number of steps (70) and ta-da! I have a (very rough) idea of how many steps I've taken. Or at least how many in relation to a baseline, which is what I need to move forward. Yesterday I managed to get my entire bag of corks into the bowl! I'm way behind today, but determined to transfer all my corks again before bedtime. (Hmmmm, that was a very strange sentence). Which brings me to a dilemma of how to improve if I'm already using all my corks. Maybe tomorrow I'll toss in my clothespin supply.... Binney",

Then I cool them quickly with a couple of changes of cold water. Peeling them is easy--actually it's fun--because when they're cooked the skins slip off in your fingers. (Don't forget to toss those skins into the compost pile). The beet itself is still deliciously firm, but not hard. I cut them into thick slices and put them in a refrigerator dish so they're easy to get at.  ;-)   Just keep in mind when you go to the bathroom that beets can tint \"things\" pinkish--alarming until you remember that you feasted on beets. The beet greens are for dinner today. A bit of turkey bacon for flavor in a dab of olive oil, with some onions, garlic and just a touch of crushed red chili. When the onion's just getting soft, add the greens, cover the pot and turn down the heat; water clinging to the leaves is usually enough to steam them. Sometimes I add a dash of cider vinegar. Good eats! Enjoy! Binney",

Of course, the more wine you drink, the more corks you end up with, and the further you have to jog, so it's also a limiting factor for over-indulgence, in case that should be a problem. But then the more corks you cut up and sprinkle on your houseplants, the fewer laps you have to run. So there's a lot of strategy to this sport as well. Keeps the brain healthy.  Binney",

Like arm lymphedema, it is caused by damage to the lymph nodes in the axilla, or by damage to the lymph vessels in the area and blockage of lymph flow by scar tissue or fibrosis. It's actually fairly common, especially in the breast following lumpectomy with SNB and rads, but doctors are slow to recognize or diagnose it, and often they don't know it can be treated by well-qualified lymphedema therapists. The reason it can occur in the chest/breast as well as the arm is because the lymph vessels of that entire quadrant of our bodies drains into the nodes in the axilla, so when the nodes there are disturbed it can affect the entire quadrant.  Bummer! At any rate, it really can be reduced and controlled, but the sooner it's treated the easier it is to do that. Here's a page about finding a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm That was probably more than you wanted to know, Nette -- sorry!

Yes, to maybe you held your finger funny, but then maybe that part is just wrapped too tight for you. And yes, the bandages could have slipped at the wrist (and that might be an indication that they're loosening due to reduction of the swelling), but then again that too may just be too tight, or you may need to get more used to the extra effort involved in moving your fingers and hand when you're wrapped. If you can rest and it isn't irritating you, fine. If not, do remove it, but make notes of all the areas of concern and your specific questions so you can ask tomorrow. At the top, if it's uncomfortable you can for sure try loosening the top wrap, just on the upper arm. Rewrap a bit lighter and smooth everything carefully. You don't want bunching at the top in particular, because that's where it should have the least compression.  My therapist didn't do a lot of explaining my first day either -- or if she did I sure didn't take it in. The learning curve is very steep and these things just take time. Besides, she needs some feedback on this initial wrapping experience in order to adjust her technique to your specific needs before she can teach you how to do it yourself. Between now any your appointment tomorrow, if it causes you pain or feels like it may be chafing or restricting, take it off, roll everything up, and take it in with you. Tomorrow when she wraps you can you have someone with you to help to learn along with you? Most of us find that helps a lot, as we're perhaps a bit too...uh...emotionally involved to take it all in. It gets better, honest! Binney",

Sorry you had to join us, but glad you found us and trust you'll feel the warmth and support here that so many of us do. Just wanted to mention the possibility of breast lymphedema, which can occur at any time following treatment. If the aching and burning are a recent development and haven't been there always since treatment, then lymphedema is a possibility. Other possible sites for lymphedema to develop are underarms, side, and back on the affected side. Doctors are slow to recognize or diagnose it, and a surprising number don't even realize it's a possibility. The medical professionals who can offer both definitive diagnosis and treatment are specially-trained lymphedema therapists (OTs or PTs with at least 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training beyond their OT or PT certification). To find one near you, check out the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. I hope your problem is not lymphedema, but wanted you to know it's a possibility, that it's treatable, and that treatment can end the pain. Be well! Binney ",

It's going to be miserably hot here before long, so I'm trying to brace myself for that and plan out my hot-wearther exercise and self-care accomodations. Lots to think about, review, and get ready for. Like a new swim suit, for instance -- Becky, I'm with you on finding \"retail therapy\" less than therapeutic! I now have a pedometer -- yes! I've spent a few days testing it out, checking it for accuracy, and trying to get a feel for how many steps I generally walk a day so I can build up to the suggested 10,000. I've been averaging about 7,000, so I'll see if I can come up with some strategies for increasing it.  Like some of you gals here, my budget is limited. At $5 my pedometer is not a precision instrument, but it's accurate enough to get me in the ball park range, and I'm good with that. It doesn't have any sort of safety attachment to keep from losing it so I improved with a piece of yarn and a carabiner. I don't have room or cash, either one, for in-home exercise equipment, but I've found bouncing on my toes to upbeat music to be as helpful as a mini-tramp or a biggish exercise ball -- fun is what you make it, so I get my daughter involved with me and she helps make it lively. Don't have an elliptical or a treadmill, can't do the gym membership, much less a trainer -- but I jog or walk indoors or out and when I need specific help with exercise advice I email my LE therapist or stop by and see her (she's used to my 1,001 questions by now!) Just wanted to note that, in case anyone was feeling LE butt-kicking was out of their price range. It's not! We can do this! Onward! Binney",

Excellent reminder--I always want instant results, and it's so easy to give up when I don't get them. Brava for you, and thanks for the inspiration! There's no law about dogs having to walk on your left side. Train your dog to walk on your right. I know a married couple who are both blind and they each have a guide dog. His leads him from the left, as usual, but hers was trained to lead from the right, so they can walk hand in hand, each with a dog beside them. Or, during the training period, either a Gentle Leader head harness or an EasyWalk harness can help reduce the pull on your arm. Once they get the idea, you can switch gradually back to the collar. There's also an arrangement called a European leash that has several rings and a clip on it for adjusting to different lengths and configurations. You can wear it around your waist or over the unaffected shoulder and just keep your hand on it for guidance--any pull is eased by your waist or opposite shoulder, not your affected arm. Lots of options--go for it! Binney P.S.--if you enjoy training, a large dog can be trained to do several jobs for you to ease your arm, from hauling laundry baskets to opening heavy doors. Fun stuff!",

Especially good because trying to add steps breaks up the time I sit at the computer, and that's a good thing--it's always hard for me to change activities and take a break, but counting steps made it motivating. Also did a lot of dog training (when I don't wear the pedometer because my pedometer pocket is stuffed with dog kibble), so I'm glowing with pride and hope I can repeat the feat today. It's hard to be consistent because...well, life distracts, y'know? Hugs all around, Binney",

Dawne-hope, I can sure identify with your sense of defeat when you do the best you can and the LE acts up anyway, or when something as \"normal\" as somebody grasping at your arm can trigger a rotten flare. It can make me just frantic. The emotional aspects of this can be paralyzing, so when it gets like that I just try to keep putting one foot in front of the other and lower my expectations of myself for a time. It's too easy to try to maintain a \"normal\" schedule when we're actually overwhelmed and need to give ourselves some room. \"Chronic\" means we have to develop strategies that take both the ups and the downs into account.

Sleeves go back to their original shape when they're wet, which is tighter than when you've been wearing them awhile. So it's not that they get heavy--they get tighter. There was an NLN newsletter article about that a several years ago, and they even gave a figure for the percentage increase in pressure. To me it was insignificant (as I say, I wet my sleeves regularly with a spray bottle when out in the heat--but this is desert so they dry quickly), but I can see where it could affect some people. We're all so different with this. We just need to know, then we can do our own experimenting A glove sure sounds more comfortable than a gauntlet for paddling. Do please keep us posted--it's all fascinating. I have decided to take 10 minutes out of every hour to jog and see how that goes. Gives me a break from the computer (or whatever else I'm doing), and I find I think better when I'm jogging. Why is that?!! Anyhow, I'm kinda liking it. I wave my arms around and do some pumping as well, so try to clear nodes every time before I start my jog. Not sure how long I'll keep this up, but it's been several days and it's working nicely. Somebody asked the other day about whether to exercise before or after wrapping, and now I can't find that post, but just wanted to suggest that exercise is very important while wrapped, as it hurries the reduction along. In fact, exercising while wrapped is top-of-the-line for swelling reduction. Go for it! Tina, so glad you're back upright on your six feet (), and equally glad for the brownies--thank you, needed that! Carol, thank goodness all the recon is now in your rear-view mirror!

The exception to that would be people with advanced LE and those who are having problems with repeat bouts of cellulitis. They do need to be wary of swimming in a lake (or the ocean) -- even in a public pool, where the actual safety of the water can vary rapidly depending on who's doing what in the water. But for most of us here, who are keeping our LE in good control and have not had recent cellulitis, showering afterward and making sure we apply plenty of lotion to keep the skin moist should be enough. Of course inspect and apply antibiotic ointment to any cuts and scratches after your shower, and be careful not to get new nicks and scrapes (body surfing into the gravelly shore, for instance--ouch!) And we all know to be careful about sun burn and insect bites. Swimming is GOOD for LE! Enjoy! Hugs, Binney",

Anything you wear beneath compression gets pressed into the skin, so needs to be smooth and the edges flat--that can be hard to do when putting on a compression glove! Once the area is healed you can use cornstarch or cornstarch baby powder patted on the web spaces before donning your glove and see if that helps cut down on the friction. I put mine into the toe end of a clean cotton sock, rubber-band the opening closed, and pat it on with that. Keep a close eye on it throughout the day to be sure it doesn't become infected. Yuck! Lymphedema! Hugz right back at ya', Binney Edited to add: Now that you're a wrapping pro you can wrap your hand for a few days to let that heal!",

If, on the other hand, this has been around awhile, what are your PS and therapist saying about it? If it's irritation from the prosthesis you could ask your therapist to cut you a piece of Artiflex to protect the area from rubbing, but if you've been wearing it this long and the redness is new that's not likely to be the reason. I'd sure insist on an explanation from one or both of them -- there's bound to be a reason, and if so there's also something you need to do about it. Best wishes from me too! Binney",

So if you want to do acupuncture, just have them avoid the entire affected quadrant, not just the arm--it's all at risk.

Becky, I like your idea of running in place to score more corks in a shorter time, and I'll try it tomorrow. But no way I can do two laps per cork because my lymphedema-brain will not allow me to count to two while walking. Is it okay to tell you all that I've been writing about my bc journey online at a literary journal called LiteraryMama, where I have a monthly column? I haven't hit the part about the LE yet but, trust me, it's coming! Here is this month's column: http://www.literarymama.com/columns/seniormama/archives/2012/touched.html If you stop by and read, please feel free to leave a comment. Oh, and tomorrow I'm going to a big First Annual BC Resource Expo which, because I only heard about it two days ago, will likely have next-to-nothing to do with LE. Next year I'll be ready for 'em!

Sometimes I use the cork-bowl point to do a few other exercises (kinda like a par course), and that's added a nice variety to the otherwise boring routine. Another diversion is that our big dog has decided my treks back and forth from one end of the house to the other is a great opportunity to dash around waving his small blanket at me in hopes I'll play tug with him (which you don't do with service dogs, but he keeps hoping!).

Either way, catching it early will make a big difference moving forward. (If you get a sleeve, be sure to get a glove or gaunlet as well, so that any swelling doesn't become trapped in your hand.)

You have suffered enough, none of it is in any way your fault, and you need to demand and expect better treatment (lots easier to say than do!)

Or better yet, someone to call the docs for you and calmly insist on help right now? When I have troubles with docs my DH comes along and, after the doctor enters and closes the door, he calmly parks himself in front of it (standing up, of course) -- slows doctors right down, and they tend to answer my questions much more thoroughly than if they have an easy escape.

      "Content": "Jan 22, 2010 10:12AM Binney4 wrote: Sher, good morning, Several years ago the research group at the U. of Arizona did a small study of MLD and found that the most effective single component was the node clearance. It was not as effective as full MLD, but more effective than JUST doing the arms without clearing the nodes. So they tell patients to do that part several times a day. The effectiveness of MLD, especially as done by patients, is variable: we forget things, or use too much pressure, or skip it for several days in a row, or generally don't have the experience to tell which areas may need more attention than usual like a well-trained therapist would. Norton School-trained therapists don't encourage patient self-MLD because as a group we're sort of undependable. But if you learned it well and do it attentively it can be a huge help with self-management. And once you learn it, it also helps to recheck your routine with your therapist from time to time so she can see if you're still doing it correctly. I too use a somewhat shortened version, but I can't skip chest and side because those are the areas that are hardest for me to control. And I clear nodes before showering or putting on lotion, then gently wash, dry, and apply lotion in the direction and order of the masssage. For me, that's very effective, but we're all different. We do all have to work out a self-care routine that works for us, and I think it's really important to have a therapist you can be honest and straightforward with, and not have her (or him) put you down. A good therapist has to be realistic too -- it's not just us patients who struggle with denial! (In all fairness, of course there are those who simply won't carry out the things they need to do to manage their LE -- also their choice, but no therapist will continue treating someone who doesn't care to do their part.) Just as wearing a sleeve without hand protection can trap swelling in your hand (bummer, Elizabeth! That happened to me too) wearing a gauntlet instead of a glove can trap fluid from your hand in your fingers, so do be careful about that. Oof! Side effect indeed! In terms of self-management, LE is a whole production in itself! Hugs, Binney",

When I asked her what a weighted bra was, she told me to wear one of my old bras with a couple of quarter-rolls in the cup. Yeah, right! A couple of filthy rolls of quarters banging around against my chest is better than a soft, fitted prosthesis!

First, breasts are, if anything, even more susceptible to cellulitis than our arms are (though they're less likely to get the kinds of nicks and scraps our hands and arms get), and it can be a real bear to get rid of in the breast as well. You might want to ask about a prophylactic antibiotic dose if you continue with these treatments. And second, cellulitis can \"brew\" awhile before taking off, so be very watchful for ANY sign of infection: redness, new swelling, itchiness, warmth to the touch, fever, flu-like symptoms. And of course get help at once if you suspect a problem. And finally, you might want to wait until the swelling is resolved from this first injection before proceeding to another treatment. Insults to an area with LE can create new damage, and the way to judge that would be whether the area can be brought into control again. Just curious -- is this glucose that she's injecting? Neuro-prolotherapy has no substantiating research, not even for it's more usual use (which is for healing achilles tendonitis). For LE it's not even on the map, so there's virtually no precedent. Which makes it interesting, but potentially dangerous. Please do keep us posted going forward! Be well! Binney",

Swimming should help, and definitely elevation until you see your therapist again on Friday. Good MLD video here:  Steep learning curve, this, but you'll be on top of it soon--hang in there!

I also learned MLD for the lower body from my therapist and find the abdominal MLD most effective in controlling it. Walking actually helps it, oddly enough, and gentle jogging (on the carpeted floor at home--don't know about jogging on concrete) is the most effective. I do the 15-minute Lebed opening exercises most days, which are designed for the entire system, so they help my leg as well. When it's acting up it aches enough to keep me awake, so I also have a Solaris night garment for my entire leg, which works as well as wrapping. (Only problem being: I hate it, of course!) Those of you out shoveling snow in the early hours, do remember (as Hugz reminds us) to stop at intervals and give the arm a rest. I strongly recommend hot cocoa breaks, but maybe that's just me! HUGZ, GOOD GRIEF! Ankles are a definite weak point, but soooooo discouraging when they decide to limit activity. Especially on a cruise! Keep a lookout for problems with the crutches, as they can cut off lymph drainage unless they're adjusted (and used) just right, so there's minimal pressure in the axilla. But, hey! I'm still rooting for a FANTABULOUS vacation! Can't wait to hear all about it! Hugs and hot chocolate, Binney",

To use it as a way of boosting lymph flow, bounce GENTLY with your feet not leaving the mat, for about 5 minutes at a time. For many of us the gentle bounce seems to stimulate the lymph system. At any rate, definitely worth a try. For extra safety, use the hand rail that comes with some rebounders and provides help with balancing. Well-fitting, fairly sturdy shoes can help to keep you from stressing your ankles; as you bounce the mat tends to turn your ankles inward instead of keeping them straight up and down (hope that made sense!) Since I have arthritis in my ankles I find I can't use a rebounder, but I get the same effect by bouncing gently on my toes on the floor. I use a kitchen floor mat for extra padding. Got my walking in this afternoon during a phone conversation with a daughter-in-law. Makes me feel extra smug to know that I'm doing something productive all the while carrying on a coherent conversation with someone who has no idea what I'm doing!

You ask a difficult question, but one we have to deal with here too often. I'll start by echoing AH's suggestion that this is absolutely up to your doctor to decide. As for what any of us \"swell\" ladies think, our opinions on whether or not to do MLD massage in your situation are totally irrelevant. Go with your doctor. That said, I can tell you what we've discovered in dealing with this question in the past. The standard reference text for LE therapy is called \"Textbook of Lymphology for Physicians and Therapists,\" by Foeldi and Foeldi (who are acknowledged leaders in the LE field). Their answer to the question of whether Complete Decongestive Therapy (massage, bandaging, exercise, skin care) causes metastases in the case of LE that appears after cancer treatment is \"NO.\" The reason they cite is that circulating cancer cells do not automatically cause metastases, and that metastasization is an active process and is not dependent on external forces, but on the biological properties of the cancer calls and the condition of the immune system. BUT, they lay down two procedures to follow in LE treatment with active cancer present: the patient must be in appropriate treatment for the cancer at the time of CDT treatment, and the therapist should not treat the immediate area where the cancer is active. Since IBC involves the skin, then, those areas where the skin is affected would not be areas that should be treated for LE. Then there's this published study: J Soc Integr Oncol. 2006 Winter;4(1):8-12. Godette K, Mondry TE, Johnstone PA. Complete decongestive therapy (CDT; alternatively known as complete decongestive physiotherapy) is a treatment program for patients diagnosed with primary or secondary lymphedema. CDT incorporates manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), a technique involving therapeutic manipulation of the affected limb. There are several contraindications to performing CDT. Relative contraindications include hypertension, paralysis, diabetes, and bronchial asthma. General contraindications include acute infections of any kind and congestive heart failure. Malignant disease is also widely considered a general contraindication; a current vogue concept is that MLD will lead to dissemination and acceleration of cancer. However, cancer research supports the contention that this therapy does not contribute to spread of disease and should not be withheld from patients with metastasis. The intent of this article is to review these data. PMID: 16737666 [PubMed - in process]  All of which is beside the point anyway, since no therapist will treat without the doctor's okay. So I'd suggest you give your doctor the name of the text and ask if he would be willing to look it over. Ask him if gentle compression is also contraindicated, and if not, you might want to consider using a LE night garment for your arm (they can be made with zippers to allow easy donning without damaging vulnerable skin). Here are companies that make them, if he gives you a go-ahead on that: JoviPack http://www.jovipak.com Solaris-Tribute http://www.solaris-tribute.com Telesto http://www.telesto-medtech.com They do move some lymph fluid, so he may not approve them. But they're comfortable and may help relieve the pain you're experiencing. I truly hope some of that helps you deal with all you're going through. Please let us know how we can help. Be well!

      "Content": "Mar 25, 2011 02:24PM Binney4 wrote: Mary, liposuction for LE has been pioneered in Sweden by Dr. Hakan Brorson. He has published some studies, which you can google. This information from the National Lymphedma Network is based on a talk delivered at their conference by Dr. Brorson: \"Q: Recently I read an article in the NY Post about liposuction for lymphedema in the arm after Breast cancer surgery. As you can imagine, after living with this condition for many years, I was very excited, but not sure where to get further information. Is it true that liposuction can reverse and cure the swelling in my arm? Where can I go for surgery? My doctor was not able to help me. Anxious to hear from you, a long time NLN Member. A: Liposuction is not a cure for lymphedema. At the present time, there is NO cure for lymphedema. The information you read about refers to a procedure done in Sweden by a Dr. Brorson. He presented this information at the NLN Conference in Orlando this year. He was clear throughout his presentation that he only performs this procedure on long standing, fibrotic, post-mastectomy lymphedema of the arm. Dr. Brorson emphasized that CDT (combined decongestive therapy), which consists of manual lymph drainage, compression bandaging, skin care, exercise, and self care instruction is still the treatment of choice for lymphedema. He only recommends this liposuction procedure to individuals who could not receive treatment and have developed severe, long-standing, fibrotic lymphedema. He emphasized that after this procedure, the individual must wear compression garments daily and compression bandages nightly, forever. The procedure does not correct the inadequate lymph drainage. It removes large amounts of fibrous tissue from the limb, and necessitates a lengthy operation with extensive scarring. While it may indeed reduce the overall girth of a very large, fibrotic limb a bit more than a course of CDT by virtue of the fact that the surgeon removes large amounts of subcutaneous tissue, the success of the follow-up home program for both therapies is determined by the compliance of the patient with wearing constant compression on the involved limb and doing the recommended exercise/self-massage program. After the surgery, if an individual decides s/he no longer wants to wear the compression garments/bandages, the limb is at extreme risk of swelling and ballooning out of shape due to the removal of the connective tissue structure of the limb with the liposuction. This procedure is not without significant surgical risks posed by anesthesia, risk of fat emboli, and risk of post operative wound infection (in a limb with an impaired immune system due to lymph node dissection/radiation therapy). It is distressing to think that a medical insurance plan would probably be willing to pay large fees for liposuction as a \"surgical correction for lymphedema\" while possibly denying payment for the safer, less expensive course of CDT. Dr. Brorson was the first to say that his first recommendation to an individual with lymphedema post mastectomy, is a course of CDT. Too bad that the reporters who attended the NLN conference chose only to highlight this radical surgical approach to advanced lymphedema. Too bad they missed an opportunity to educate the public about CDT which is safe, non-invasive, and very successful in reducing and managing lymphedema, which to date, has no cure.\" So, yes to both your propositions: yes, it's a procedure that's been seriously considered and studied (in at least a preliminary way). But also yes, this looks very much like a clinic trying to drum up business by jumping on this particular bandwagon. Liposuction is very interesting from a research perspective, and important for us to know about -- thanks for bringing it up! One aspect of progressing LE is inflammation, and one way the body responds to this inflammation appears to be the deposition of an abnormal layer of fat just beneath the skin over time. So the theory is that this special kind of liposuction can reduce that particular side effect of the inflammation caused by the LE. Not a cure, but it does address a real phenomenon of the LE.

Not real common, but with your treatment plan in place you're well on your way to solving that problem! Make sure you bring it to the attention of your doctors right away, as they may want to rule out other causes (like a blood clot).  For now, elevate your arm as much as possible (on the back of the couch while watching TV, on pillows at night), stay really well hydrated (helps dilute lymph fluid and keep it moving) and pause from time to time to take a few deep, abdominal breathes (stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies). Where breast cancer and lymphedema are concerned, there are no silly questions, potentially or otherwise! Good for you for being aware and looking for answers. Do let us know what you discover.

This doesn't sound like lymphedema, because it rarely causes pain when it's in the arm (though it sure does in the breast or chest). Did this pain just come on recently? Can I ask you why you consider it a result of the taxotere rather than of the radiation? Just curious. Did you have more than one field of radiation? Do you have any weakening of your hand or fingers? Damage to the brachial plexus nerve from surgery or radiation can cause symptoms like yours, even several years after treatment, and multiple radiation fields can sometimes be especially damaging.  I hope your doctors will be able to help you sort this out and get proper treatment to control the pain and get you back your life!

So it's worth learning what the risk-reduction strategies are and deciding for yourself what you want to do about it. With no node dissection your risk is low, but it's not zero. And if it happens to you it's 100%. Like you, my doctors told me after my prophylactic mastectomy that I didn't have to worry about it, but I did develop lymphedema. I wish instead he'd told me that I was at risk and offered me guidelines for how to deal with it. Then I could have chosen my own life-style compromises and avoided the nasty surprise that lymphedema is when you don't realize it could happen to you. It might be a good idea to request a referral for evaluation by a well-trained lymphedma therapist. S/he can take baseline measurements for future reference and give you personalized risk reduction tips.

The garments can be a real challenge, that's for sure, and the tamox and hot flashes take it right over the top. For most of us the garments are a \"must\" in order to stop it from progressing, so I hope some of the others will come along with suggestion for staying cool at work. Since you're staying in one place, can you plug in one of those small desk fans close by and direct it toward you? One thing that's helped me is one of those cooling neckbands that are filled with little beads -- you soak them in water and they absorb it and stay cool for hours. Somehow keeping my neck cool makes the rest of me feel better. Drinking LOTS of water is especially helpful when you're hot, and it dilutes the lymph fluid so it flows better too. Keep a glass close by (and then, of course, you have to remember to drink it!) One thing that may help control the swelling on the job is to build up some more strength in your arms, but very gradually. Sometimes that makes even repetitive activities possible. A PT could help you with ways to do that. Even without extra conditioning, though, if you can take frequent brief breaks at work to stretch your arm, that may do the trick to relieve the repetition. While taking deep abdominal breaths, stretch your arm above your head and open and close your fist slowly several times. Or bend your fingers into \"cat claws\" and paw at the air a few times. Your customers may think you've gone nuts, but you'll relieve some of the congestion in your arm. Pabbie, did your therapist teach you the special massage to move lymph fluid out of your hand and arm? If she didn't, do ask her to show you, and then use it daily at home. It's a great tool for controlling this confounded stuff. A lot of the women here have very few restrictions with their lymphedema, but I can't do certain activities anymore because of mine.  I can't crochet at all, and I've had to learn to use a left-hand-only typewriter because my right arm swells if I type with it. There are ways around most anything, but they all take effort and creativity, and sometimes that's hard to come by. I think you're really brave and smart to be looking for solutions, and I hope others will come along with great suggestions to help. Be well! Binney",

Usually when I wrap it feels like good support, but that's it -- it for sure doesn't feel normal. I can identify with that sense of not knowing where to put this huge, awkward bundle of bandages that used to be my arm. I do a lot with pillows. I agree you need help from the therapist with both the knuckle problem and the top of the wrap. No therapist can get it exactly right the first time, because we're all different in what we can tolerate and how it affects us. She needs your feedback, and it needs to be soon so no damage is done. If it's worrisome tonight, undo it and call her tomorrow. Maybe, though, when you support the arm well and aren't trying to to anything much with it, it will feel okay for the night, and if so it's fine. I'm hoping you'll surprise yourself with a good night's sleep in spite of all this, but don't feel you should tough it out if it's chafing or ouchy. Let us know how it goes! Big hugs, Binney",

I did have a Juzo custom truncal garment several years ago (and hated it--we could hope this version is better, but I wouldn't count on it.) The custom truncal garments are very exactingly fitted--think burn garment--so that the compression is even over every dip and curve. If you have one breast, or breasts of two different sizes, the garment fits each exactly. There is also a built-in separation between two breasts, so there's compression in the cleavage area as well. As you all probably have experienced, that's impossible without very careful overall fit. That said, it doesn't (in my opinion anyway) result in a comfortable garment, even if it's an efficient one. I also found it very hard to breathe in, but I'm sensitive to compression so that's probably an individual thing. At any rate, the Helastic is a thick fabric and too agressive for me--my custom vest was a lighter fabric. If anyone tries it (either you're independently wealthy or you have excellent insurance), do please let us know what you think. When we're thinking of a shirt design, we're not talking about exact fit. We're willing to use Swell Spots as needed to help us as individuals work out our own perfect solution. So I don't think there's any comparison between a custom compression vest and an off-the-shelf compression shirt. And for my money, the shirt has a far better chance of being comfortable as well as effective. JMHO Be well, Binney",

Carol, Bellisse compression bra has a symbiotic relationship with JoviPak to make chip pads (the \"official\" name for swell spots) that fit all the pockets in the bra. Without that kind of relationship a pocket would be a hit-or-miss thing, since a company might quit making a given size at any time and leave GO high and dry. If they wanted to pursue that option with Solaris I suspect Kathy-and-company might be interested. We could ask, yes? Glennie, the chances are good your therapist can make you a custom \"swell spot.\" The technology is not impossible, though you need a sturdy sewing machine and needle. Many therapists make chip bags for their patients. Or if you're handy you can make your own. Some of the LE supply stores sell the foam chips, and selecting the fabric yourself would give you some options we don't have with the ready-mades. Several years ago Solaris used a fabric that was as soft as doeskin, not the somewhat coarse fabric they use now. I have no idea why they abandoned that, because it's incredibly soft against my skin and it has worn very well. I'm still using my Kimbe made from that fabric, always choose it over the others I've bought more recently.  Why is this all so difficult?!!  Hugs, Binney",

Besides her years of experience and practice, she gets to use two hands and I have to do it with one -- and when I wrap my right (dominant) arm, I even have to do it with the \"wrong\" hand. Very clumsy -- very maddening. What I didn't know was that I could take my own sweet time, both to learn it and to do it. Arthritis is a (literal!) pain, but as long as you're giving yourself time and room to do this, it's definitely something you can accomplish. Now when I have to wrap I set myself up to succeed by cutting the tape first, arranging everything in order, laying the instructions handy in case I forget something, and doing it seated in the middle of my bed so if I drop a bandage roll it doesn't hit the floor and unroll. I plan plenty of time in case I goof up and have to rewrap a gauze roll of bandage, and I make myself relax before I start so I don't get frustrated and find myself wrapping too tight. It's fine to pause after each step and give your hand a rest -- nobody's timing us! All that sounds like a lot of bother, but it gets to be second nature. A sense of humor helps! I'm sorry about the new therapist, btw. Having trouble getting your questions answered is more than a \"personality thing,\" because this is a long-term relationship and we have LOTS of questions we need to feel comfortable asking.  You can do this, Sher!

Of course you \"forgot\" to mention that there's been real improvement in your arm all the way up, because there's STILL swelling in your hand. Aaaaugh!!! This stuff just has a way of making us all obsess. I have arthritis too, and the wraps can make bad knuckles hurt. Let your therapist know -- she may want to pad it with extra Artiflex or a foam pad, or she may want to wrap a tad looser in that spot. We don't know what's too tight and what's too loose without a bit of trial and error (sometimes heavy on the \"error\"). And even now, if I'm tense or frustrated I may wrap tighter than I should, or if I'm in a hurry I may wrap too loosely. This is a work in progress, and your progress so far sounds good. Hands are a bummer. Always harder to conquer than the nice, cylindrical arm. You and your therapist will get it, just takes a bit longer. Wrapping should feel supportive and snuggy but, as Kira says, never painful (which defeats the purpose because pain draws lymph fluid to the site). It also feels clumsy and bulky and (for me at least) pretty bizarre. It's not something you do and forget about it. We're used to not thinking about our arms at all, but wrapping them in five or six layers of bandaging material makes it difficult not to think about it constantly. I walk through the mall wrapped (or sometimes even with just a sleeve on) and wonder why everybody else's arm is working when mine isn't. Then I wonder how my lymph system could have functioned all these years without a bit of thought on my part. So, annoying, distracting, frustrating, clumsy-making, humiliating? Yes. Painful? No. As Kira points out, the point of wrapping is to apply the most pressure at your hand and less going up. A related but strictly practical point, however, is that if the top is not tight enough the stupid thing will fall down your arm after an hour or so. There's an ideal involved here, and we do the best we can every time to get as close to that as possible, but the principal is: more pressure at the hand and less as you go up. If my hand swells after wrapping it MIGHT be because I wrapped too tight higher up and trapped fluid in it, or it might be because I wrapped my hand too tight (there is nothing simple about LE). If I wrap too tight my lymph system rebels and rebounds with more swelling. So you have to consider all the angles. Only right now (since you're right at the beginning of your therapy intensive) it's your therapist, not you, who has to try to figure it all out. My maintenance wrap is the same as my therapy wrap. Sometimes that's not the case. For instance, if you had a stray area of swelling that had become fibrotic you might need a chip bag (sort of a home-made Swell Spot) over that area until the fibrosis was softened. Later on you might never need a chip-bag there at all. So in that case your maintenance wrap would be different. The degree of compression you'd need for both wouldn't be likely to change, though, unless you started out with extreme swelling, which we bc gals rarely do. I agree that therapists don't get it about how bandages feel, even though all through their training they're constantly practicing wrapping one another. They don't have the same degree of dread about it that we do, and just knowing it's not forever would make it so much less of an insult. On the other hand, there have been times when I've been glad my therapist was not in a position to empathize too closely with me -- I need her matter-of-fact approach to solving my dilemmas. And besides, I have all of you to commiserate with me. THANK YOU, ALL YOU SISTERS OF SWELL! Hugs, Binney",

Here are some pictures of sleeping positions for back and side both: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm#sleeping%20positions And I agree with Lisa about not using the compression garments now -- with new swelling they won't fit correctly and can cause more swelling.  Instead, just use some of the suggestions you were reading from the website. Once you start the gentle MLD massage you'll see good progress on the swelling. I hear you on how difficult this is to accept. It probably won't help to tell you that it gets easier, but I'll tell you anyway: Leah, hang in there, it gets easier, honest! Please do tell us how we can help. Hugs, prayers, Binney",

Glad you found us and hope you'll come and post often -- we'd all feel privileged to offer you our support and love as you muddle through along with us. As a mom of kids with serious and complicated medical problems, I wanted to make a couple of practical suggestions. First, go out today and buy a three-ring binder notebook and: a set of dividers for it a three-hole paper punch some of those donut-shaped sticky things to reinforce the holes you punch a couple of easy-grip pens or pencils one of those clear plastic zippered pockets you can put in a three-ring binder Designate one divider section for medical records and ask for copies of every single test (including bloodwork) and path report from here on out -- punch holes in them, reinforce the holes on the back of the paper, and stick them in that section. One section will be for insurance. Keep all insurance correspondence in order in that section. Add a few sheets of lined paper to that section to, and every time you talk to your insurance people get the date, time, name and title of the person you talk to, and the \"reference number\" of your call, then write down everything YOU agreed to do and everything THEY agreed to do for future reference. Another section is for information that you gather from your doctors or off the web, etc. Add some lined paper there as well and take notes at every doctor appointment. Another section is for your daughter's health information to date: allergies, previous surgeries, immunizations, serious illnesses, etc. Also include a page of all the contact information you'll need in order to fill out doctor intake forms: insurance names and addresses, etc. Another section is for the names, addresses and phone numbers of neighbors and friends and relatives who've offer to help. As time allows jot down what they've done, so later you can remember to thank them -- at some point you'll want to do that, but now is not the time to worry about it. They really do feel helpless so they'll welcome your being specific with them about what you need done, whether it's a meal, a trip to the store, or a load of laundry.  In the clear plastic zippered pouch keep the pens or pencils and all those little business cards you'll be collecting from doctors, labs and such, so you have all that information handy when you need it. Take this notebook with you to every appointment so it's all at your fingertips. At home, keep it near the phone so you can record the details of all conversations with insurance or doctors' offices. My other suggestion is to contact your insurance company and request (or demand, as the case may be) a case manager for your daughter. That's a person who will act as your contact with the insurance company and help smooth the insurance issues that arise. All the companies have case managers, but they can be stingy with them -- they're for patients with complicated health issues. You definitely qualify, so don't let them tell you otherwise.  Sorry to be so mundane when I'd really rather be right there giving you a big hug, but cyber-space is a real limitation that way! Hugs anyway, and prayers too, Binney",

Fits well without prostheses. I've slipped in prostheses too and find the fabric doesn't \"bridge\", so I'm thinking it will work well with pockets. Neckline is nice--low enough without being so low it leaves me swelling at the top of my chest. The raglan design makes it very comfortable, but my one question (when I get a chance to wear it for a long period of time, hopefully this afternoon and evening) is whether it will be snug enough right in front of the axilla where (unfortunately for me but happily for this shirt test) I'm currently having trouble controlling the swelling.

So I'm wondering if you've been diagnosed with lymphedema, or are your doctors still trying to figure out if your swelling is caused by herceptin or other drugs? Have you been to a well-trained lymphedema therapist yet? Lymphedema needs to be brought under control right at the start by a good therapist, and she will teach you all the self-care during that time too. Then the therapist helps you get fitted for garments (both a sleeve and a glove) to wear during the day. Regular day garments should NOT be worn at night. For nighttime you need to order special quilted, foam-filled night garments, or else wrap your arm in very special short-stretch bandages the way your therapist has taught you. Unless you have some other condition that requires water pills, they are not good for treating lymphedema. That's because they remove the water from your arm but leave behind some big, bulky protein molecules from the lymph. Those big molecules act like magnets to draw even more water back into your arm, so it can actually make the swelling worse.  Some kinds of machines (or pumps) can also cause you problems, because they do nothing but \"wring\" the water out of your arm. It leaves, but because your lymph nodes are not there to handle it, it will just come back into your arm later unless you have learned from a good therapist how to move it gently to other areas of your body. When these not-very-good machines pump the water out of your arm, they make it back up at the top of your arm too, and this can cause hardening of the tissue there. So all those reasons are why you need a good therapist to help you with this. I know that's expensive. If you can't afford many visits, make that clear to the therapist at your first appointment so she can help you figure out the best plan for you. Maura, I hope you can get good help with this and get the swelling under control! Gentle hugs! Binney",

Please feel free to print it out and hand it around to everybody on your team: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/essential%20informa... A few years ago Stanley Rockson, a lymphedema researcher at Stanford, did a survey of all the med schools in the US and found that the average amount of time in a doctor's entire education that is spent learning about the lymph system is 15 minutes. Nursing programs are unfortunately much the same. In the past couple of years that figure may have changed some, since more and more is being learned about the critical role played by the (nearly invisible) lymph system. Until the med schools start teaching this, and the medical qualifying exams start including questions about it, our healthcare providers are not likely to know much about it. So, weird as it may seem, educating them is up to us.  Together we can do this! Onward! Binney",

My surgeon told me the same thing -- no precautions necessary. I had one node removed on my left, cancer side, and a prophylactic mastectomy on the right. I'm slim, no other vascular problems, in good physical shape before the surgery, so no additional lymphedema risks. But I now have lymphedema in both arms and in my chest and back as well. The right hand first swelled when I flew to Alaska without the protection of a compression glove, and my left arm developed lymphedema when I let them do a blood pressure on it. I do wish very much that I'd known to take precautions, because lymphedema is for life. For awhile I was angry that my doctors didn't tell me how to protect myself, but then I read a study done by Stanford Universrsity that found that the average amount of instructional time spent on the lymph system in U.S. med schools is 15 minutes. So I realized that my surgeon simply didn't know about it, and it wasn't worth the energy to be angry at him. I do educate my doctors now, though. I give them print-outs of the National Lymphedema Network Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel. You can find them here: http://www.lymphnet.org. Maybe print out copies for yourself as well, and review them from time to time. There are a number of women here on the boards who have lymphedema after prophylactic mastectomies, and others with more extensive surgeries who were also told not to worry about precautions. Any one of them will tell you it's way better to avoid the risks in every way you can, so you're really smart to be asking these questions. Hope you never have a single \"swell\" day! Binney ",

The GOOD NEWS is that MOST of us will NOT ever develop LE. The figures go like this: between 15% and 40% risk for arm LE. The lower number is for women who have had SNB, the higher numbers for women who have had axillary dissection and/or rads, especially to the axilla and supraclavicular area. Besides that risk, there's around a 12% risk for developing BREAST LE if you've had a lumpectomy, SNB, and rads. It is also possible to develop LE in your chest after mastectomy. It's possible to have breast or chest LE without any arm involvement, but not treating the chest/breast LE is an invitation to arm and hand problems. In other words, all of us are at risk. That's the research. An estimate by a surgeon about the rate of LE among his/her patients doesn't have quite the same degree of reliability for a number of reasons. Partly because LE can develop months or years later, but mostly because s/he doesn't see the patients for very long afterward. On top of that, many times it's the oncs or PCPs who diagnose LE, so the surgeons aren't involved in the diagnosis or treatment supervision. And of course, because LE is so little taught to our doctors, there's a lot of misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis, too. Then there's the element of (understandable!) denial -- my own surgeon told me he has NEVER had a patient develop LE, so he refused to refer me to a LE therapist for treatment. Another doctor on my team finally gave me the referral, so even though I've told my surgeon about my experience, as far as he's concerned he still believes no patient of his has ever had LE.  Some of the women on our boards here had their bc surgery 10, 15, even 23 years ago (and they're still dancing with NED--yes!) and just recently developed LE. The idea that the risk of LE disappears after 2 years is only wishful thinking, probably based on anecdotal experience back in the days when women did not generally live much longer than that after their BC treatment. Now that we have a long life to look forward to, taking the simple precautions the National Lymphedema Network (www.lymphnet.org) recommends for the rest of our lives is a small price to pay for avoiding this \"swell\" side effect. Sunkistmi, the sleeve they're talking about is a compression sleeve (and it should always be worn with a compression glove or gauntlet, by the way, to prevent any swelling from settling in your hand.) Yes, they're like compression hose for your arm -- that's a good comparison! They have to be fitted by a LE therapist or an experienced and trained LE fitter, usually at a Durable Medical Equipment provider. As otter points out, they're helpful for reducing your LE risk when you're traveling, exercising, or doing any unusual or strenuous activity. Wishiwere, I had to laugh when I read your post -- yeah, I'm a bit of a lymphedema Crusader Rabbit, for sure, and I'd say the nasty surprise of  it when everybody assured me I didn't have to worry is what lit my fire! Each of you will make your own compromises with the risk you face, as it should be, but at least you can now make informed decisions instead of just hoping in the dark. Be well, all! Binney ",

It's difficult to see truncal swelling, partly because it can be diffuse, and partly because our \"geography\" has changed so much from treatment.

I wear a small in a beige cami, a medium in a black cami. That said, the beige WearEase Slimmer does run true to size, but their compression T-shirt runs smaller.

The Solaris sleeves are cut on the straight of the fabric too, and only the directional stitching curves (not the fabric), leaving the fabric itself straight on your arm. Those have seams too (as opposed to directional stitching) and even on the Solaris the SEAM should be straight up your arm even though the directional stitching curves as it goes up.

In fact, Dr. Marga Massey in NOLA is conducting research on her patients to see what the outcomes will be. Dr. Corinne Becker in France who developed the procedure has reportedly done thousands of these surgeries, but she has only done very limited follow-up and reporting on results. And the studies she has published were of very small numbers of patients whom she chose herself to report on, not even a random sample. Also, there has been no long-term follow-up to determine either the results over time or the safety. Dr. Massey is the first person doing this surgery who has set out to study the results, but it will be some time before those results are published, and no doubt longer before we know what percentage of women go on to develop leg or abdominal lymphedema. Dr. Massey herself is clear that the possiblity of leg lymphedema exists (although she considers it a small risk). Much to her credit, Dr. Massey has herself taken a full lymphedema therapy instruction course, so she's up on what is known about the workings of the lymph system and the interventions to diagnose and treat it. She has her patients measured, both arms and legs, prior to surgery and at intervals following, though I don't know how long she plans to follow these patients, and as we all know lymphedema can develop at any point post-surgery. Dr. R. Stanton in the UK has published recent studies that strongly suggest that post-mastectomy lymphedema is in some cases linked to a congenital lower-functioning lymphatic system. In other words, many of us who develop lymphedema may have an in-born predisposition to this condition. If that's the case, then messing with other lymph nodes is likely to cause more grief somewhere down the line. But the science we need to predict that with any accuracy does not yet exist. At any rate, the results to date seem to be a mixed bag. In many cases it seems to improve the lymphedema and in some cases the swelling appears to be gone, though of course the life-time risk of new swelling continues to exist. In other cases there is little relief. There's way more that we need to learn about the lymph system before we can understand what all the repurcussions may be. Personally, I'm intrigued by this and hope to goodness the doctors and researchers together continue to gain the knowledge they need to make this and other interventions possible -- and safe. We're not there yet, but it's sure worth watching! Do let us know what you decide to do. There are several doctors doing this in the US now, and if you choose to do it you'll want to select the doctor very carefully for your best chance at a positive outcome. Take your time and ask loads of questions. Be well! Binney",

If I were you I'd try to pin down your therapist to give you a definite diagnosis. If she's doing daily massage and wrapping your arm, then it's likely she now considers that you do have LE. Your doctor's reasons for saying it's not LE are frankly not valid, if he's only basing it on the number of nodes you had removed. So don't be confused by that. I'm sorry he keeps on repeating that -- it must be so frustrating for you! Your therapist is the professional best able to give you a definite diagnosis. The wrapping and massage therapy sometimes goes on for longer than four weeks, though generally there's a break for a month or more before re-starting therapy. During that break you would likely wear a sleeve and glove to maintain any loss and keep the swelling from getting worse. Then, after a break, you might start therapy again to reduce it further. If you don't have the indentation when you press on your arm it could mean two different things. Either no LE, or that the LE is no longer Stage I but has progressed to Stage II, which might be the case with you -- again, ask your therapist what she thinks. If you have LE, then it's very likely you will need to wear your garments for the rest of your life. LE does not go away. You can usually keep the swelling away, but only by daily massage, exercise, compression, and careful skin care. The cording may or may not reoccur, but usually it doesn't. Even if it does, it will go away again in about two months, whether you do anything about it or not. Gentle stretches help ease it, as I'm sure your therapist has showed you. The LE, though, is a permanent condition. Does any of that make sense?! The good news is that, with proper treatment by a therapist and good self-care afterwards, you can maintain the size of your arm and hand and help prevent both infection and disability. If I've confused you, please ask again and I'll try to clarify. Betty, I do hope this is not LE, but if it is you're already doing the things that will lead to good results, and besides, we're all here for you. Binney ",

In answer to your specific questions, I suppose you do go through Stage I before you go to Stage II, but lots of women are diagnosed with Stage II before they are even aware they have LE. When LE is cared for you can expect that any hardening in your arm will be softened, especially if it's treated promptly. Sometimes mine flares up and I can feel hard areas in my upper arm. But if I go back to wrapping and step up my massage the hardness goes away again. If you are truly on the \"borderline,\" then doing daily massage may likely help you stay well. And wearing a well-fitted sleeve and glove for any strenuous activity, travel, or exercise can help too. Also, of course, you'll want to follow all the recommendations for reducing your LE risk from the Position Papers here: www.lymphnet.org Do stay in touch and keep us posted on your progress! Be well!

Getting a sleeve wet increases the compression, so you might want to test that out very gradually while you're still home before you do it on a vacation. That way, if your arm reacts badly to the added compression you'll have your therapist's help to keep things back in control. Nevada is likely to be dry, so wet garments will dry quickly. The Arizona desert areas stay extremely hot throughout the summer, but starting in early July the monsoons roll in, bringing humidity but no rain, and garments will take longer to dry. Tennessee will no doubt be downright muggy, so again drying time becomes an issue. If your garments stay wet too long while you're wearing them you risk infections--no good! Lots to consider! Just do your experimenting at home beforehand, so you don't have to deal with any nasty surprises on your trip. Mostly, ENJOY! Binney",

She should stay well hydrated (lots of water, no caffeine) so the lymph will be diluted and move easily. Also, keep her arm elevated as much as possible (on the couch while watching TV, on a pillow at night) to encourage drainage. Gentle exercises help stimulate lymph flow, but strenuous exercise or anything that strains her arm should be avoided. She'll need to keep a careful watch on her arm for any sign of infection -- redness, warmth, fever, itching -- and get help immediately if she suspects any problem (stagnant lymph fluid breeds bacteria, making infection a serious matter). She should use pain relievers if there's discomfort, as pain draws lymph fluid to the site. Please send her our best wishes for quick and uneventful healing! Binney",

It doesn't work for me--I wake up cranky and hurting--but theoretically a brief nap shouldn't be a problem. Day garments work by stimulating lymph flow with muscle movement, so they're not useful when you're not working your arm, but that can happen if you're just sitting reading or watching TV too. Elevating your arm might help, and certainly not lying on that side. Let us know what you discover! Hugs, Binney",

Because of the tenderness of your radiated skin neither compression nor lymphedema massage would be possible until the rads ends and some healing takes place. But you could sure set up an appointment for evaluation and advice with a certified lymphedema therapist even before you're finished. She can give you some guidance on how to prevent further damage while you wait for treatment. Until you can get help from a well-trained therapist there are some things that may help limit the swelling. Like lowering your salt intake, increasing your fluids (helps dilute the lymph fluid and makes it easier to flow), and avoiding overheating (not easy to do in the summer!) Talk to your doctor about prophylactic use of topical or oral antibiotics to prevent infection, since your skin by this time is compromised and lymphedema increases your infection risk.  Here are two web sites for finding well-trained lymphedema therapists near you (you'll need a referral from any doctor on your team): The Therapist Locator is at www.mylymphedema.com. Click on the Locator and follow all the links. The Lymphology Association of North America (LANA, which is a certifying agency for lymphedema therapists) has a listing on their web site at www.clt-lana.org. And for accurate information on all aspects of lymphedema, the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org  Sadly enough, there are a lot of us with chest/breast lymphedema on the Lymphedema After Surgery board, so please feel free to come join us there with questions or rants or whatever we can help each other with. MaryAnn, I really hope your remaining treatment flies by and you're able to get lymphedema treatment and resolution quickly. (((((Hugs))))) and prayers, Binney ",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2008 04:25PM - edited Apr 22, 2008 04:57PM by Binney4 Oof! Jane, I'm so sorry. There aren't words, truly. How can we all help? Just ask, and we'll be here for you. Like they say, lymphedema (LE) is breast cancer's \"dirty little secret,\" and I'm so sorry you hit the secret jackpot this way. Okay, before you proceed, let's talk physiatrists. See, there are two things going on here that you need to know: First, there are currently no training standards in place in any state in the U.S. for Lymphedema Therapists, so anybody with any level of training can hang out their shingle and begin to treat patients with LE. But there ARE standards YOU can enforce. Call and make sure before you see ANYBODY that they have at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond their PT or OT or MT certification and at least a year's experience treating LE. Check out the Position Paper on Therapist Training at the National Lymphedema Network here: www.lymphnet.org Mind you, I'm not suggesting the massage therapist you saw is wrong about the diagnosis: that makes perfect sense to me. But I am suggesting that being trained in Germany doesn't automatically make her a reliable source of LE treatment information. In fact, considering the present state of U.S. lymphedema awareness and treatment, it's unfortunately more likely to be hokey than it is to be helpful. Second, even some of the schools (whether U.S. or European) that train for-real lymphedema therapists also train therapists for the resort market. They do a sort of pop LE massage that's currently in vogue for \"boosting the immune system\" and whatnot. It is relaxing, harmless, and actually moves lymph (as you discovered). But it's not the same thing as a directed and personalized therapeutic Therapy Intensive from a fully trained therapeutic LE therapist. Two different animals. And there's more: there is no research evidence, here or anywhere, that shows that any sort of cream or drops (or drugs, or any number of other interventions) is either effective or even SAFE. But there are LOADS of products out there being touted for treating LE, because of LE's \"for life\" nature, and a lot of them are European. That suggestion alone sure gives me pause, and it should serve as a red flag for you as well. The last thing you need now is further incompetence. If the MD they're sending you to is connected with the LE program they're sending you to, you're going to want to check this out real well. While it's true that the Europeans are way ahead of us in legitimate LE treatment, it's also true there are any number of them here taking adventage of both our current fascination with pop lymph system stimulation and our ignorance of what the condition of lymphedema actually is and what its treatment involves. In short, while it's wise to check out the other possibilities for your swelling (which sadly include blood clots or new tumor growth), these tests are best done by your own med team (even if they've already dropped the ball on this and you have to browbeat them into it). PET or CAT scans or doppler imaging may be suggested. Or if you're already in the clear on these things (and your own docs would know this) than the next step would be to see a fully-trained LE therapist. To find one near you, you might try following the links at the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com, or check out the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA) site at www.clt-lana.org. I do realize your trust in your own med team has been blown apart on this, but the last thing you need now is a wrong turn on treatment, and there are unfortunately many wrong turns out there. Bottom line, of course and always, is that the choice of your care is entirely your own. I wouldn't want it any other way. But I'm not wanting to leave you in the dark on this either. If you'd like, PM me with information on the LE center you're planning to go to and I'll hop around and see what I can find out about them. Same thing with the creams and drops -- I'd be happy to ask around before you use them. This whole subject is just fraught with pitfalls, yes? And it sounds like your med team has a perfect record for falling into all of them. But there's still good news for you: with prompt and proper treatment you'll soon have all involved areas in good shape, and your life back in your own control. Big (((((HUGS!))))), and prayers too, Binney ",

In a life-threatening emergency whatever works to deliver life-saving care to a patient is admissible. Short of that it would be really wonderful if all medical personnel understood the importance of avoiding an area with lymphedema -- we're still working on it! This women has a somewhat better chance of avoiding this situation in the future if she wears a medical alert bracelet on that arm. It should warn against needles, bp and IVs but should not use the word \"lymphedema\" because many medical providers don't understand or adhere to the restrictions associated with this condition but will honor a more general warning. Neon pink hospital alert bands are available free from Peninsula Medical, and many of us keep them in our purses and glove compartments to whip out in case of an emergency. They're somewhat more noticeable than a simple medical alert bracelet, but still no guarantee, especially in a truly life-threatening situation.You can order them here: http://www.lymphedema.com/ I wonder about some of the wording in your post. For instance, I'm not sure what you mean by \"recovering from lymphedema.\" It is a chronic condition, so we never really \"recover,\" just get it under control and have to work to keep it that way. If she is now in more pain or experiencing new swelling this can again be brought under control, as Kira mentioned, with help from her therapist. But do keep an eye out for any sign of infection: redness, rapid new swelling, increasing pain, itching, warmth to the touch, fever or general achiness. If she suspects infection she should get help immediately, as with lymphedema it can spread rapidly. Some women here have experienced cellulitis following injuries such as this without even a skin break, so it's important to be aware of the possibility In case you're asking these questions with an eye to litigation, you should know that no one (to my knowledge) has successfully challenged lymphedema maltreatment. There are no agreed-upon standards for diagnosing lymphedema and as yet no universally-acknowledged best practices for handling it. As you can imagine, it is not possible ethically to do research regarding the safety of taking blood pressure on an arm with (or at risk for) lymphedema, so there is also no evidence-based data. All of which makes malpractice impossible to \"prove\" in court. For what it's worth, I developed lymphedema in my left arm immediately following the use of a blood pressure cuff during a minor emergency, so I'm a believer in not using an at-risk arm for this. But who could prove one followed the other causally? May I suggest that this woman consider meeting with Patient Relations at the facility she went to, and insisting that they better-train their ER personnel regarding lymphedema. She might enlist the help of her therapist in creating an in-service for ER staff to help assure that this doesn't happen to anyone else. I'm really sorry for this set-back, and hope she soon has everything under good control! Binney",

If this link will work, here's an interesting page about it at the ACS site: http://www.cancer.org/docroot/MIT/content/MIT_3_2x_Discrimination_Outside_the_Job_Setting.asp?sitearea=MIT Here's a section of interest: \"Places of public accommodation include places that are generally open to everyone. They include restaurants, hotels, theaters, doctors' offices, drug stores, retail stores, museums, libraries, parks, private schools, and day care centers. The ADA requires the property administrators of these kinds of public places to remove barriers when it is \"readily achievable\" to do so. This means that it must be fairly easy to do without much trouble or expense. Examples of removing barriers would include making a simple ramp over a few steps or other modest adjustments to parts of a public place's physical structure that may impose barriers for people with disabilities.\" Note that doctors' offices are specifically listed here as having to accomodate the ADA. The ACS page before this one (called \"What is the Americans With Disabilities Act\") lists who qualifies for ADA accomodations: \"The Americans with Disabilities Act may apply to you if: You have a physical or mental problem that substantially limits one or more of your \"major life activities\" (see below). You have a record of having had such a problem in the past. Other people think you have such a problem, even if you do not actually have it. Some of the \"major life activities\" covered by ADA include: seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, caring for yourself, and working.\" Note especially the references to performing manual tasks and caring for yourself, both of which are compromised by flare-ups caused by unaccomodating medical practices. Anyhow, there's a gov't phone number there to call for specific information. (\"ADA specialists are available Monday through Friday from 10:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time) except on Thursdays, when the hours are 12:30 p.m. until 4:30 p.m.\") If you do, please let us know what you discover.

I hope someone else has explained it to you by now, but if not I'll give it a try. Please forgive me if I'm going over stuff you already know. You can find Lymphedema (LE) Treatment guidelines in a National Lymphedema Network Position Paper here: www.lymphnet.org Basicly, LE is treated initially by a process of: special massage to move fluid out of the congested area, wrapping in special bandages in such a way that the fluid is directed out of the affected area, careful skin care to prevent infection, deep breathing and exercises to stimulate the lymph flow. This Therapy Intensive, as it's called, can last from two to six weeks (or sometimes longer) until the fluid is reduced as much as it can be. Then the therapist fits you for a sleeve and glove, which will help maintain the loss but will NOT reduce any swelling that's there. Only massage and wrapping (plus exercise) can reduce swelling. In other words, the wrapping and the sleeve-and-glove are not interchangable. They're two different interventions for two different purposes. The therapy (massage, wrapping, etc.) gets the excess fluid out of there. The sleeve and glove help keep it out. You need both, but the therapy part comes first. You're right -- the wrapping is hard to tolerate. We've all had our bandage-throwing fits and shed a whole lot of tears. (Hmmm. I still do from time to time, actually!) Good news is, it works, and you can graduate to sleeve and glove. Other good news: women going through therapy can for sure count on their Sisters of Swell here to cheer them through it! And best news of all: once you've learned the self-massage and the wrapping, you have the tools you need to care for yourself under nearly any circumstances, and you don't have to keep a therapist in your pocket to maintain good LE control. Hope that makes sense and encourages you, because you really will feel better knowing how to care for this rotten stuff, and we really do understand how hard it can be to get to that point. Please let us know how we can help, Binney",

      "Content": "Aug 12, 2008 10:52AM - edited Aug 12, 2008 10:53AM by Binney4 Hi, Luv, Geesh, I'm sorry for this new and crazy \"canceritis\" scare. Hoping (and betting!) it's not going to be anything horrible. But I do trust by now you're checking it out with your favorite doctor. It sounds a bit like cording (Axillary Web Syndrome), though with that most women feel a \"cord\" running down their arm, rather than a row of bumps. But for some of us the \"cord\" can only be felt in certain places along our arm, skipping other areas completely, so possibly it could be felt as separate \"lumps.\" The pain when stretching is very much a part of cording too. Some researchers consider cording to be a form of LE because the hard places are partly composed of lymph tissue. I'm not sure I agree with that, because it goes away after a couple of months. (Rarely, it returns again later, but again it disappears with time). But I do think it's a good wake-up call in terms of using LE risk precautions, because for sure it indicates that your lymph system has been seriously insulted! Good Position Papers on LE Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org Cording is helped by GENTLE stretching. Doing it up the wall in a warm shower (not hot!) is especially helpful, as the moist warmth is best. PT is a possibility if that works for you, but if it's cording it will go away eventually whether you see a therapist or not. Some therapists \"snap\" the cord in a single quick movement, which relieves the issue at once, but the jury's still out on whether or not that's a very smart thing to do. Sooooo - onward! Better to get an expert to look it over, but please relax in the meantime. And do please let us know what you discover. Very gentle (((((hugs!))))), Binney ",

The bristles are designed not to dig in (so as not to make streaks on the wall), and there are enough of them to exert a gentle force that might move the skin very gently in a way that's similar to our hand movements when we do mld.

Stages are one of those things, but here's an article from Lymphnotes that covers the generally-accepted stage descriptions: www.lymphnotes.com/article.php/id/4/  Two things are confusing with this. One is that \"sub-clinical\" actually means that there is already LE present, but it's not yet measurable or visible. That's because there can be as much as 30% more fluid present in your tissues than is normal (because the lymph system is compromised) before it becomes measurable. That's why they're saying anyone who's at risk for LE is stage 0, because it's difficult to determine who may already have unmeasurable LE present. There are, though, some new ways to measure intersticial fluid BEFORE it's visible. When that technology becomes more widely available we may be able to predict who's likely to develop LE, and even treat it before it becomes a problem. The second strange thing is this: when you think of stages of LE you naturally think of more and more swelling. But LE stages are not so much about swelling as they are about internal damage to tissues. So even with limited swelling, untreated LE can cause irreversable damage, including fibrosis, further lymph vessel destruction, more infection risk, limb weakness, and loss of range of motion. Which is prbably more than you wanted to know, right?  Bottom line is we're all at risk for LE, so diagnosis of Stage 0 in some cases may make it possible for your insurance to pay for a visit to a LE therapist for evaluation, baseline measurements, and education on how to avoid further problems, so that's a good thing!  Be well!

When there's swelling in the lymphatic system it's not called lymphedema, it's called lymphangiectasia. Fortunately, that condition is rare. Lymphedema, on the other hand, is swelling of the tissues, not of the lymphatics -- exactly what he's saying you have. If the lymphedema specialist you saw didn't diagnose it as lymphedema, perhaps you might find another one and get a second opinion. In case you'd like to do that, here's a page with suggestions for finding a therapist who is fully trained in lymphedema therapy near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm The reason you want to get help with this soon is because lymphedema is staged, just like breast cancer is. If it isn't treated it progresses through the stages, resulting not only in further swelling, but in hardening of the tissue (fibrosis) that further blocks lymph flow. Left untreated, it also raises your risk of a serious, systemic infection because stagnant lymph fluid is an excellent breeding ground for bacteria. Breast lymphedema (called \"truncal lymphedema\") can be present without any arm or hand lymphedema. But it does indicate a compromised lymph system that can lead to arm lymphedema too. So when you see a lymphedema therapist do also ask to be fitted for a compression sleeve and glove to use prophylactically when traveling or exercising. Did your lymphedema therapist suggest compression for your breast? There are bras made specifically for this purpose, such as the Bellisse: http://www.bellisse.com Most women with breast lymphedema, though, are able to use regular bras or camis that provide extra coverage and support. Scroll down toward the bottom of this page for suggestions for breast compression that can help to relieve the swelling and discomfort: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Itching, by the way, can indicate many things, but one of them is cellulitis, which can \"smoulder\" for awhile before becoming active. If you notice new redness, heat to the touch, or fever, do get help promptly. Sure hope you get some solid answers -- and some relief! -- real soon! Very gentle (((hugs))), Binney  ",

You'll want to talk with you onc about the possibility of lymphedema and ask for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema (LE) therapist. (That'd be somebody with at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond their PT or OT certification and at least a year's experience treating LE - call before you go and make sure.) An LE therapist will be able to evaluate your situation by medical history, physical exam, and arm measurements. In cooperation with your oncologist, she can provide a diagnosis, and if it's not LE she can teach you risk reduction methods, show you prophylactic lymph massage, and fit you for a sleeve and glove to wear when working, exercising or traveling. If it is LE she'll explain the therapy program, which should include daily Manual Lymph Drainage massage (MLD), wrapping with layered bandages, exercise and skin care. That may last two weeks or longer, after which you'll be fitted for sleeve and glove and possibly a bra as well to add compression and support, and you'll have learned the self-care to maintain everything in good control. Hope that's not more information than you wanted. And on the other hand, if you want more please feel free to ask. I too was told my risk of LE was low. A single node removed on one side, prophylactic mx on the other. With LE , anything's possible. I'm still holding out for better results for you, manos. Hope to hear soon that all's well with you.

We grow our gardens through the winter and spring, then let everything lie fallow during the 100+ months ahead. Along about October we'll plant again. Weird, huh? It'd be great to see a LE therapist for an evaluation. She'll do baseline arm measurements so you have a future reference, show you how to do prophylactic massage (very nice!), and fit you for sleeve and glove. She'll check the fit later, too, so you'll be sure everything's in good shape. Here's a website for finding a well-trained LE therapist: www.mylymphedema.com. Click on the Therapist Locator and follow the links. You'll need both a prescription for the sleeve and glove and a referral to the therapist, and you can get those from any member of your medical team. Most of us do best with our oncologists, but you never know. Whoever's willing!  Obviously this is not standard practice or there wouldn't be so many of us completely in the dark about our risk and what to do about it, so it may take some insistence on your part. Insurance doesn't always cooperate, either. In a pinch you can get the prescription and take it to a well-trained and experienced LE fitter (generally at a prosthetics and orthotics supplier, but some of the gals here get them at full-service pharmacies), but you won't know who that is without some phone calls and direct questions about training and experience. They should NOT be selling you just whatever they happen to have on their shelves, y'know? By the way, fully-trained LE therapists ARE the health professionals who deal with LE in this country, though there's been some movement in recent years toward an actual medical specialty in diseases of the lymph system, called Lymphology. That'd be nice! Be well! Binney ",

It does sound like what you're dealing with is LE. The cording is related to LE because the \"cord\" is partly made up of lymph tissue. With only two nodes removed your risk for developing LE was somewhat lower than someone who had more nodes, but there are many of us with only a single node removed, or with a phophylactic mastectomy, who have developed LE, so it's definitely possible. Unless you get treatment for the LE it will progress. It may swell more, but even if it doesn't there will be changes going on INSIDE that are not helpful. For one thing, untreated LE results in hardening of the tissues (fibrosis) that can make the swelling permanent and also make your arm weaker and decrease your range of motion. Besides that it makes infection more likely, and you definitely want to avoid that if you can. So do see a well-qualified LE therapist and get re-evaluated, and start treatment soon if she finds that's necessary. (Only, you have to be sure that the therapist you see has had at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her/his PT or OT certification and at least a year's experience treating LE). By the way, your dominant arm will likely be naturally a little bit larger than your non-dominant arm, so it's important to have this evaluated by a LE therapist - she'll know by physical exam what she's dealing with.

I hope it will be a breezy day so you can stay cooler! Some hot-weather tips that may help are to carry lots of water with you and drink often so you stay well-hydrated. I usually carry a spray bottle as well for spritzing my face and shirt. Because it's dry here in the desert I also spritz my garments to keep my arms cool, but if you live where it's humid and they won't dry out quickly that may not be a good idea. Remember your LE garments won't protect you from sunburn, so use a sun-block or wear something to cover your skin. Wear a broad-brimmed sun hat or carry an umbrella (parasol). You might want one of those special bead-filled neck bands that you soak in water and it stays damp and cool - turn it occasionally to move the heat away from your skin. The American Cancer Society's TLC catalog had them, but I've also seen them at Walgreens. And do stop walking as soon as you sense you're overheating or tiring, so you don't end up regretting an otherwise wonderful occasion. Most of all, enjoy the day! Be well! Binney ",

And knowledge is power--it's what lets us make up our own minds how we want to respond to the risk-reduction information we have, and then put aside our fears as we take action to get on with our lives. Since cording is generally quite painful and limiting, I've never heard of anyone not knowing they had it, but stranger things have happened! Here's more information about it (it's actually called Axillary Web Syndrome, or AWS): http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillar... There is some evidence that the presence of cording can increase the likelihood of developing lymphedema, but I'm not sure whether that is because of the cords themselves or the pain (which can cause lymph fluid to increase in the area) and restricted movement (which limits the pumping action of the lymph system and makes it harder to get excess fluid out). There's also some evidence that some of us have lymph systems that are more limited than others, and one of the indicators of that is that, even before cancer treatment, our hands might swell when we walk and dangle them, or our legs might swell when we sit for a long time. If our lymph system's capacity is already sluggish in these ways, it may indicate we're more prone to lymphedema when our lymph system has suffered trauma from surgery or radiation. None of which is a guarantee that we'll ever develop lymphedema, because there are many more factors involved as well, and as yet we have no way of predicting them (or even of identifying them all.) As to what to do about diabetes blood testing, the issue is not necessarily the \"trauma\" of the lancet prick, but the possibility that creates for infection to enter. And if someone has lymphedema, or is predisposed to lymphedema, then the infection risk from any skin break is higher than normal. And infection also ups your risk of developing lymphedema, or creating a flare if you already have it. An added problem here is that lymphedema can be present before any swelling can be detected, so your infection risk may be heightened in your affected-side hand without your even knowing it. SO! I hear you on being used to using that hand for finger pricks, plus the added issue of playing an instrument for which you want your other hand to remain sensitive to the strings. If, then, you decide to continue testing on your at-risk hand, here are a few suggestions to increase your safety: 1. Take the time to wash your hands well before every test (standard practice, I know, but sometimes we're just in a hurry, right?) Carry some of those individually-wrapped wet wipes with you for away-from-home convenience. 2. Use a new lancet absolutely every time you test (again, standard practice, but...well!) 3. Clean the site afterward, and be alert for any signs of infection. Here's information on what to watch for: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Med... We all have to decide what compromises we'll make to the reality of lymphedema risk, and not wanting to have regrets is an important part of making those decisions. This is all your call, and I'm sure hoping whatever you decide to do, you'll never have to join our \"swell\" sisterhood! Gentle hugs, Binney",

There are a lot of known risk factors, and a lot of theories about others, and no idea which might be most important for any one person. (Just as a disclaimer here, let me admit that I had one node removed with my left-side cancer surgery, and no nodes purposely removed with my right-side prophylactic surgery, and I have lymphedema on both sides.) Here are some of the risk factors we have research evidence for: 1. obesity 2. weight gain, especially after surgery 3. prior trauma to the area 4. diabetes 5. other vascular problems 6. surgery on the dominant side 7. poor previous general fitness (a couch potato) 8. radiation, especially to the axilla and/or supraclavicular area 9. and there's some evidence that tumors on the upper, outer quadrant are more likely to result in lymphedema    And there are current research directions based on these theories of causes: 1. genetic predisposition 2. inflammatory response And last (and definitely least!) are the ideas I personally just sorta think might contribute, but there's absolutely no evidince for: 1. surgical technique (crash-and-slash vs. gentle; zapping tool vs. scalpal, etc.) 2. how many nodes there were in the area to start with (so, the PERCENTAGE of nodes removed or destroyed, rather than just the NUMBER of them--only problem with this is nobody knows how many any individual might start with, because it varies so much from person to person) 3. Avastin and other chemo agents that MAYBE either do direct damage or limit recovery of the lymph system after it's damaged (and on the other hand some women on Avastin find their swelling improves, so who knows?) In other words, as davebobbie so eloquently states, it really doesn't take that much effort to protect yourself...(thanks, davebobbie!) Risk reduction guidelines (also Exercise and Air Travel guidelines) available at the National Lymphedema Network: www.lymphnet.org Wishiwere, I'm sorry we're all at risk for this, and I'm really glad you're giving it some thought, and I truly hope you never, ever have to join this \"swell\" group!

That's because it can develop at any time after any breast cancer surgery, so if it happens to show up during rads it may still be because of the surgery rather than the rads. At present we have no way to know who's most at risk for it either, though certain things do increase your risk, including: number of nodes removed (though a prophylactic mastectomy with no nodes removed is still a risk), whether the surgery is on your dominant side, radiation (especially axillary and supraclavicular), overweight (especially weight gained after surgery), diabetes, prior vascular problems, prior trauma to your chest or axilla (auto accident, playing tackle football ), diabetes. There are other theories as well: an inflammatory response, a genetic predisposition, etc. Fortunately there are lots of easy lifestyle adjustments you can make that will help prevent lymphedema, and they're well worth the effort to learn about and practice. You can find infomation about that in the Position Papers at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org. The papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise are especially useful. Also, bc.org plans an Ask the Expert On-line Conference on lymphedema prevention in April -- yes!  Hoping you remain swell-free! Binney ",

I've run across some brazen fitters who made me cry too (but then, LE is a sensitive subject with me), and I currently drive a LONG way to see a great one. I've had fights with my insurance. But this isn't some once-in-a-lifetime relationship, it's on-going, so it's worth the battle -- and the travel, and the inconvenience -- to find someone who can help you intelligently. Why does this have to be so blasted hard?! I have both Jovi and Solaris. Jovi is beautiful, the fabric is yummy, and it comes in colors. Solaris looks less polished but they fit me better. So I wear Solaris sleeves and a Jovi vest most of the time, but I switch off from time to time just to keep the ol' LE guessing. Like Revkat, my arms and hands are smaller in the morning. I wear them sometimes for traveling as well, especially by car (I wrap for the plane). They're much easier than wrapping, and when I get to my destination I can wait a bit and then change into day garments easily, without having to roll up the bandages. I also use them during the day for flares if I'm going to be hanging out at home. The feel good, they're washable, and they work well. Either company can probably steer you to a fitter within a reasonable distance of you, and you can terrorize your insurance company until they let you go there to get a decent fit without the sick, sick sales pitch. Another thought: I get my garments from Hanger, which is a large prosthetic/orthotic place that's covered by my insurance. I called their area office and asked them if they had a fitter anywhere in their chain of stores in AZ that was an expert at this. Of course they told me they all were, but I persisted and they finally admitted there was one woman (a long way from me but what the heck) who actually knew what she was doing. Those were not their words exactly, but you get the idea. Sure enough, she's a treasure. I send everybody around here to her. At first they refuse to go that far, but after trying a few others closer they eventually decide it's worth the trip. Maybe we should car-pool... Keep us posted! Special, stupid-fitter-recovery hugs!

Interesting about the zipper, Nordy. Solaris puts a zipper in mine what runs from just above the wrist to just below the axilla and does not open at either top or bottom (since my LE is bilateral and I wear a chest garment as well, and they all snap together into a single, grizzly bear-type garment, I have to have zippers in the arms or I'd never be able to get it on -- or to get an arm out to go to the bathroom at night!) Jovi tells me they won't make a full zipper, though they'll put one in either the upper arm or lower arm (?) Since I've never been able to figure out how that would help me at night, I have to order theirs with separate gloves or I'd be stuck in it. (Does that make sense? It's hard to picture this arrangement). So, is your zipper only on half the sleeve? And if so, does it open at the bottom? (Or top, as the case may be). If I only needed one sleeve I wouldn't bother with any zippers, though I think they're great for women with fibromyalgia or trouble donning due to arm strength issues. Okay, I just reread what I wrote and it's not exactly eloquent. Hope you can figure out what I'm talking about! Be well, Binney",

You can always ask your therapist to re-measure so you can judge better what's going on with your arm. You DO need to finish the rads, so whatever has to happen to do that is what you need to do. Since you're so close to being done with the rads, you might talk to your therapist about whether you can just wait a bit so you don't have to stress over both at once. Stay well hydrated, elevate your arm as much as possible -- and do let us know what happened today with rads, and what you decide to do. VERY gentle hugs, and prayers, Bridget, Binney ",

One is where your scars are, because it's hard (or impossible) to get the lymph to flow smoothly past a scar. So some mapping has to be done to take that into consideration. If you have only one side that has been operated on, then the fluid from the affected side can be redirected to the opposite armpit area. But if you've had surgery on both sides (even prophylactic), then the opposite armpit is also at risk if you overload it, so then the direction would be downward to the groin. That means clearing the groin and abdomen well as part of the initial steps of the MLD. Then when you try to move the lymph fluid downward the area is ready to receive it. Clear as mud, right?! In a nutshell, we're all different, which is one reason MLD is not a do-it-yourself learning experience. BUT, if whatever you're doing is causing more swelling (it should NEVER cause bruising!) then your therapist should reassess what she's doing and find a better route. It's possible she's breaking up fibrosis first (which requires a firmer massage and can sometimes be, uh, uncomfortable). But the actual MLD should not end up hurting. (Let me clarify that a bit: early on with MLD some of us experience a deep aching, or even a touch of nausea, as the process begins to work. It can last several days but shouldn't be a regular, on-going feature.) Definitely let your therapist know what's happening and ask her to explain it to you. Communication between you is really important because this is a long-term relationship and you need to be comfortable asking her for info or clarification. Any condition that takes this much continual self-care requires that we understand each step. Let us know what you discover. Hugs, Binney",

      "Content": "Binney4 wrote: Hi, all, As we're all suffering with the Haitians and their towering needs for all life's basics, I just wanted to share with this special \"swell\" group about the LE needs in Haiti. Before the earthquake, Haiti had (by some estimates) nearly a quarter of their population affected by lymphedema -- the kind that is transmitted by filarial parasites through mosquito bites. In 2003, Emory University in Georgia began a program of reducing LE there. This involves distribution of medicines to kill the parasites, distribution of mosquito netting for nighttime use, and, most importantly, eradication of mosquito-breeding standing water. By all reports the program has had substantial results and new LE was becoming far less common. This is important, because without therapists, bandages, and garments, people there with LE became hugely swollen (elephantitis) and disabled as far as employment or subsistence farming. What we have now, though, since the earthquake, is thousands of people sleeping out-of-doors with no mosquito protection, the destruction of the medical supply system, and the rainy season due in a few short weeks -- so, lots and lots of standing water for mosquitoes to breed in. In other words, a LE disaster in the making. Though it's hoped that a whole lot of antibiotics are being flown into Haiti as part of the rescue efforts, it's not clear that there will be sufficient supplies for the cellulitis we could expect with this level of LE. And as if that isn't enough, what the people of Haiti are dealing with in the aftermath of the quake is thousands of crush injuries and consequent amputations. The need for prostheses to assist these amputees is obvious, and hopefully already in the plans of the medical teams. What's less obvious to everyone but us is that crush injuries are a major cause of secondary LE, due to the wholesale destruction of fragile lymph vessels near the surface of the skin. I heard a doctor at a clinic in Haiti on a news report this week mention the swelling in the leg of one of his patients. He said it was permanent and nothing could be done to reduce it. Which, in the absence of both trained therapists and compression supplies, is unfortunately accurate. So these people, too, will find themselves hopelessly handicapped by a condition that in our country can be treated and managed. Again, untreated, their lymphedema will lead to cellulitis and from there... I've written to the National Lymphedema Network, urging them to use their resources to find trainers for new Haitian therapists, and hopefully donated supplies for wrapping and compressing these thousands of new lymphers. I don't know what else to do, but if any of you have suggestions of ways we could influence the provision of personnel and supplies for coping with this, please share your ideas. If you're a praying person, please join me in pleading for help for these folks. We struggle to get what we need here, but for the most part we succeed. Without help, though, these people will soon be dying...of lymphedema. Binney Log in to post a reply",

We can give you some suggestions, and hopefully that'll help you make your own decision. If you already have some lymphedema in your left arm, it is at very high risk for infection, so you definitely want to avoid aggravating it with either blood pressure or any skin breaks at all, no matter how small or \"sterile.\" In terms of IVs, there is also the problem of your adding fluid to the mix with the IV, which your nodes are no longer able to handle, plus the fact that since the lymph circulation is sluggish there it will be hard to predict how you body will handle whatever is being infused. So, left arm's a bad idea. Lymphedema is a distressing condition anywhere, but in your dominant arm and hand it's even worse. How much you want to risk that is up to you, but I can tell you that you sure don't want it in your right hand. Alternatives are a bit of a bother, but not as much of a bother as bilateral lymphedema. You can get blood draws done in your feet and IVs in your feet or neck. It requires that your doctor write \"Draw from foot only\" on the order sheet. (The contraindication to that would be if you have blood clotting problems.) Shortlady, if you already have some lymphedema in the left arm, what you need is not an OT \"with lymphedema experience,\" but a fully-trained lymphedema therapist. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Just like breast cancer, lymphedema is staged, and it will progress without treatment. Even if the swelling is still minor, the accumulation of lymph fluid causes tissue changes inside that can lead to hardening (fibrosis) and serious infection (cellulitis). With prompt and proper therapy, though, you can keep your arm in good shape and lower your risk of permanent tissue distortion. Keep us posted on what you decide to do, and tell us how we can help!

Mine's a looser knit than the one you show. What matters is to get the right size (width), as there are tubes for larger arms and for assorted sizes of legs as well. The soft \"cast padding\" is probably Artiflex. I use a foam roll for wrapping my arms (lasts forever), but I do use pieces of Artiflex to protect places where I may be having irritation -- especially under my arm where a garment may rub against my truncal swelling. Nice stuff. I don't put anything over my bandages and have never had any problem with them getting dirty, with the exception of my hand bandage, across the palm where that tubular arrangement would probably not cover it anyway. My therapist did put a lengh of the stockinette over the bandages of one of her patients, though, because she rode a motorcycle and had problems with her bandages unraveling and flapping along behind her in the wind. For more ordinary folks like me, though, a couple of pieces of tape on the last bandage works fine, with no tubular thingy needed over the top Does that help any? Steep learning curve here! Be well!

We're all anxious to learn more about this, especially in the form of on-going research that can substantiate the effectiveness -- and long-term safety -- of this surgery. Will you be doing this in conjunction with reconstruction? As you're consulting with the surgeons who are doing this in the States now, it would benefit all of us if you'd encourage them to take responsibility for structuring a research arm to this procedure and publishing their outcomes -- at the present time they don't have plans to do the accompanying research, but that could really help us understand if, when and why this surgery works. It would add important information to our understanding of the lymph system that could lead to better treatment and management, as well as help us determine who may or may not be a suitable candidate for this treatment. As Jane mentions, lymphedema research is proceeding in a number of fascinating directions. A recent UK study offers some hope that we may some day have a better way of determining who's most likely to develop lymphedema and who isn't, and it points to reasons why some of us have it and others don't. Very exciting possibilities from that kind of knowledge! Do keep us posted as you learn more about this. Be well! Binney",

I wanted to give you a couple of sites to research if you'd like. The first is a brief article from LymphNotes about carpal tunnel and lymphedema (LE): http://www.lymphnotes.com/article.php/id/324/ And the second is www.lymphedemapeople.com, where you should be able to find information on the subject, usually research-related. A number of women here have dealt with this, and I hope they come along soon to share their experiences with you. There's been some research evidence lately that problems like CTS, rotator cuff problems, trigger finger and tennis elbow may be related to LE. The theory is that pre-clinical LE (that is, excess fluid in the tissues that is not yet measurable as swelling) may put stress on these joints and nerves, actually causing the problem. Some reports suggest that LE therapy (called Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) that involves special manual manipulation, compression, exercise, and skin care) can actually relieve the CTS in some cases. It certainly would be worth a try, at any rate. You'll want a fully-trained LE therapist and a referral from your doctor. Here's a site for finding a well-trained therapist in your area: www.mylymphedema.com. Only such a therapist will be able to tell you if the swelling you're experiencing is LE. It's important to get an LE evaluation, at any rate, since this is an at-risk arm and any treatment for CTS is likely to cause problems with LE (and therefore with infection and further swelling). There's also some evidence that LE itself is an inflammatory response -- your refererence to \"flaming CTS\" made me think of that. As to gabapentin making you feel crazy, I'm sorry I can't help you with that as I haven't ever been on it. But for sure this entire BC journey has made me more than a little crazy, and LE is the craziest part of it. I sure hope you get on top of this soon and get the pain to stop!

      "Content": "Apr 7, 2010 09:28AM - edited Apr 7, 2010 09:29AM by Binney4  KC's question: \"With the arrows pointing to the armpit, and there being one-way valves within the system, it makes no sense to me that any massage would be in the opposite direction of natural flow.\" KC, as I mentioned in a PM, I've never thought about this question of the valves in the vessels stopping the flow when we try to move lymph in the direction opposite to the way it's worked all our lives. So I consulted with a couple of lymph-expert friends. (They thought this was an excellent question, by the way, and one no one had thought to ask them before) First, the excess fluid we're trying to remove is not in the lymph vessels, it's in the tiny spaces between body cells -- the interstitial spaces. It's this fluid we're moving across the watersheds to where it can be picked up by functioning lymph vessels and ferried through functioning nodes, cleansed, and pumped back into the circulatory system. So we're not trying to make the lymph fluid flow backward in the vessels, but to get it to another part of the body where it has a better chance of getting back into the vessels and going on its way. (Which is why, if you've had bilateral surgeries, you don't want to direct the fluid to the non-lymphedema armpit, because you're dumping a lot of extra fluid there for the nodes to process, and they're already compromised.) One of my friends, therapist Tom, added a couple of points that I'll just quote here for you -- just because they're interesting to me and might be to you as well: \"In the upper abdomen (just above the groin) you have numerous collateral lymph vessels that travel in all directions.\" In other words, the groin area can pick up excess fluid from the tissues coming into the area from many different directions. Thank goodness!  And then this: \"Those valves in the lymph vessels are not like the valves in your veins. They can allow fluid to move bi-directionally if forced to do so (hence the problem with lymph reflux when the system becomes overloaded).\" Which is not what your therapist is trying to do, of course, but I thought it was interesting that lymph vessel valves are not quite what we envision. Hope some of that helps. Gentle hugs, Binney ",

In the meantime, if it were me I'd go for the MLD. The general guideline (conservative, because there's no real evidence one way or the other) is not to do MLD directly over an area of active cancer, but this is obviously not the case for you now. In any case cancer spread is far more complex than just encouraging sluggish lymph flow--in fact, if we didn't want to move lymph fluid we'd have to sit perfectly still and not move a muscle! Not real practical, and lymph flow is important to our immune systems anyway. So, guarded opinion is, go with it.

It's not unheard of for LE to start in the thumb, so that's sure a possibility. I'm assuming since you're doing MLD that you already have a LE therapist, yes? If so, did she teach you the entire arm and hand routine, or just the truncal part? And if you're doing the hand massage too, is it helping? If you have a sleeve and glove for travel or strenuous activity, now would be a good time to try them and see if they help to keep the thumb swelling down. Other than that, good interim measures (until you can see a well-qualified LE therapist) would be to avoid using that hand as much as possible, keep it elevated, and drink plenty of water. Also avoid heat and putting it in hot water (like dishwater or a hot bath). If you don't have a LE therapist, here are a few in S. Africa for starters. Don't know where exactly you are so these may not work for you. There are no doubt others. If you need more you can follow the links on the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com.

Really glad you have one already.) I'm not sure what she told you about using your arm (and if she said not to use it more than necessary, that's what you should do), but IF your hand and arm is wrapped it's generally very helpful to move and exercise your arm. That's because the action of your muscles against the compression bandages acts as a pump to move lymph fluid along. So unless she told you otherwise, WHEN YOU'RE WRAPPED, do move your hand and arm often throughout the day. Flex your fingers, then flex and rotate your wrists, then your elbows, and finally stretch your arms from the shoulder in all directions. If you can do this with your hands above your head, so much the better, but if not any movement at all should help. It's summer where you live, yes? That's a bit of a bummer, for sure. I've had to wrap one of my arms the last few days because I've over-used it lately, and just this morning as I re-wrapped I was thinking how glad I was it's winter here (well, as winter as it gets in the Arizona desert!) So I'm feeling your frustration with the wrapping and the heat . Hang in there - it gets better, honest! Tell Rika we're all rooting for her! Hugs and prayers, Binney ",

I'm really sorry I put that so poorly. Here's the thing: it's not a bit good to cut your arm or be stung by a wasp, either. Or a mosquito, for that matter. Any of those events (even a paper cut) can trigger lymphedema. In fact, there's recent research evidence that the effect of these \"insults\" to an at-risk arm is cumulative. That is, even if the first or fourth or fortieth event doesn't trigger it, the next one might. But of course no one knows for sure. MOST of us who are treated for breast cancer won't ever get lymphedema, no matter what we do. We just don't know which ones of us are most at risk. Just want to reiterate that the compromises we each make about our lymphedema risk are ours alone to make. No one should feel guilty either way. The good news is there's treatment available for anyone who develops lymphedema, and by being aware of the possibility we can seek treatment quickly, when it's most effective. Be well! Binney ",

Most of what you're describing does sound like LE rearing its ugly head, though I've never had trouble with taking a deep breath from LE. I HAVE had that problem from costochronditis from rads (I maybe didn't spell that right). It's sort of an inflammation around the ribs and as I understand it, it can come and go for years out (though I haven't had it again since the first time). It made me swear off of barbequed ribs, though! My guess is that if you find the MLD moves it out, then it's most likely LE, and a theapist visit should be helpful in finding strategies to deal with it. What kind of shirt did you try? Have you tried a cami or breast binder? Those might address the problem more thoroughly. Before you pay out for a new therapist, do call and talk to her/him about how much experience they've had with truncal LE, as that can vary. Please let us know how it goes for you.

I'm not sure why it would take longer to heal than it would have before (unless you actually had LE present), but depending on what exactly got injured it sure can take a long time for sports injuries to heal. Pain draws lymph fluid to the site, which can put a strain on your compromised lymph system, so you do want to reduce pain as much as you can. But not with any temperature extremes. WARM is okay, but not hot. If you use cold, be sure to pad the area well so it's not icy, and don't leave it on longer than 15 minutes. (Both heat and cold can cause swelling - sigh!) I'd guess anti-inflammatories would help with the pain and any swelling too -- ask your doctor what's best for pain relief. I'd sure lay off the tennis until this is healed. You don't want to risk increasing the pain or the extent of the injury. Once it's healed do go back to it, but carefully, working back up gradually to full activity. The good news is, exercise is good for reducing LE risk. I sure do agree with Debbie that an appointment with a fully-qualified LE therapist would be a great idea. S/he can take baseline arm measurements, teach you Manual Lymph Drainage massage that can help prevent LE, fit you for compression garments, and give you tips for on-going self-care. (When you get a sleeve for exercise, be sure to get a glove as well, and always wear them together.) You'll need a referral from your doctor, and then you'll need a well-trained therapist. You can use the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com to find one near you if that's a problem.  You'll find other tips for prevention in the Position Papers on Risk Reduction and Exercise on the National Lymphedema Network web site at www.lymphnet.org. Hope the healing goes smoothly and fast. Be well! Binney ",

I have to explain that my Solaris order is a zip-front vest with two full snap-on sleeves (attached gloves with finger spacers). The snap-on feature is important because if I have an arm or two wrapped because of a flare-up I have to be able to remove the sleeves. Also, I sometimes use the vest alone, with both arms wrapped, when traveling. So anyhow, today when I tried on the outfit at the fitters all the snaps popped open. We snapped it all up and tried it again. Same thing. The fitter called Solaris and it seems they've gotten an order of faulty snaps; four other customers have had the same problem (or at least four other customers have told them about it). In fact, one of the snaps would not even snap. But at any rate, the slightest tug unsnapped the whole shebeng. Which of course makes you wonder about quality control before these things go out the door. Interestingly, the person my fitter spoke to at Solaris today was the same one who was less than civil to me, so when the fitter returned to the fitting room she was...uh...steamed. As to the adjustments we'd ordered to the shoulder and armhole so that I can move my arms once I have it on, try as we might (and we tried everything we could think of for about an hour this morning), we couldn't get it to stay together long enough to see if it fit. But I doubt it, because the shoulder is still too short and the cut of the armhole is the same as it was. They've had it for three months, and apparently all that happened was that they installed faulty snaps. Okay, so it's on it's way back to Solaris, and they've sworn to my fitter they'll fix the snaps and have it back to me by -- ta-da!! -- the second week of July. And since I ordered it the second week of July, 2007, maybe we can have a birthday party for the stupid thing when it gets back. Not a happy camper, Binney ",

Lots of things dry it out (for instance, in the summer it'd be sun, wind, swimming--in winter it's cold and the general dryness of the air). The reason that's especially important for us is because of our infection risk. Even micro-cracks in dry skin can allow bacteria to enter and create havoc. Lotion also keeps cuticles from drying out (so they don't cause cracks and pulls) and helps avoid chapping of knuckles and elbows.  Some lotions are greasier and grosser than others, but all of them are supposed to be absorbed by the skin (some quicker, some slower). So waiting a few minutes after applying lotion makes it easier to put the garments on over the lotion. I use Vani-Cream lite from Walgreens, which goes on without that greasy feel and absorbs quickly. But there are lots of choices. Before LE I never used lotion at all. Now it's a couple-times-a-day routine. Can't say I like having to use it, but it saves a lot of potential grief. Lymphedema--BAH! Binney",

A hot-pink hospital-style wrist band that identifies the arm as off limits for sticks or blood pressure, free from: http://www.lymphedema.com (they take awhile to get - if it takes too long send them an email to prod them about it) A pink arm cover that states NO BP/IV, NO BLOOD DRAWS and costs $4.99: http://www.g-sleeve.com BUT, don't count on either alone! As Lisa suggests you can write on your arm with permanent marker (it comes off later with alcohol), and you can even have your doctor sign the arm with your marker. You should have those instructions written on the orders as well. Especially for blood draws, labs won't do a foot draw unless it's written on the order sheet. Before any procedure talk, talk, talk to everyone who comes within range about leaving your arm alone. When you call to make an appointment for something requiring special consideration, do tell them what you'll need so they can have an appropriately skilled person on hand. Hope that helps! Binney ",

If you live someplace dry you might want to use a spray bottle to wet your sleeve down occasionally (allow it to dry in between wettings). If it's humid and the garment takes longer than 15-20 minutes to dry that's not such a good idea, as lingering dampness can create a fungal infection risk. Still, if it's hot/dry enough, the water feels really good. Short of a spray bottle, I've been known to wet my arm down in a drinking fountain. We also use the spray bottle to keep our necks wet, and if it's not enough, even our shirts and shorts. Extreme weather calls for desperate measures! Taking my sleeve off when it's that hot, as attractive as that sounds, really isn't workable for me. Heat causes increased swelling, so my garments are more important than ever in the heat. But other cooling methods are available. Cooling vests like construction workers wear can really help, as they keep the core temperature down. Other cooling items keep head or neck cool, and there are even cooling packs to stuff in your bra. These are NOT ice packs, just cool packs--extreme cold is no better for LE than extreme heat is. Ya' gotta stay hydrated, and that can be hard to remember to do. There are all kinds of tote-along water containers, some with straws. Whatever works. Of course stay in the shade as much as possible, and early morning hours are best to be outdoors. For us that means getting up early -- our current rise-and-shine time is 5:00. Where we live many stores accomodate the temperatures by opening much earlier this time of year. Even our zoo opens around 6:00 in the summer. This stuff sure isn't easy! Stay cool! Binney",

If you don't already have information packets from your insurance, call and ask them to send you complete info for filing both an appeal and a grievance. You'll need a calm and organized statement (outline form helps - you want it clear and easy to reference) stating the problem, the steps you've already taken, the exact action you want the insurance company to take, and all the reasons why they should do that. You also need as much supporting documentation as you can find: anything to do with reconstruction, skin-sparring techniques, usual ps protocol, etc. (assume they're as dumb as stumps and find information on EVERY aspect). Also include a copy of the complete 1998 Women's Health and Cancer Treatment Act (or whatever it's called) that provides for recon or other surgery. Highlight the crucial parts, but include the whole of each document. Also, attach letters from as many of your doctors/therapists/NPs/PAs as you can convince to support you. On your outline, note each document and letter where it's appropriate. THEN take the entire stack of papers, in order and neatly labeled, and HAVE YOUR DOCTOR FAX IT. If you fax or mail it they're not obliged to read the attachments, but if your doc faxes it they must read it all, every page. Good for them! They'll learn something! And one of the things they'll likely learn is not to mess with you again. Win-win! Be sure to also file a grievance at the same time, stating exactly the anguish they are causing you with this delay and the impediment to adequate health care, recovery, and healing that they're causing. State that the action you wish to see is promp approval for the clean-up surgery they owe you. I know this is a lot of work, but it's got its satisfying aspects. When I hand my doc's nurses a thick stack of documents to fax for me I always think they're going to balk, but they hate insurance companies at least as much as I do, and they rub their hands together in glee and chuckle as they retire to their fax machine.

Jeanne46, the choice to continue to use an affected arm is certainly yours to make, but just so the decision you're making is an informed one: anybody can do a blood pressure on your calf, using the pulse near the outside of your ankle. It may register slightly higher, but if you make sure you're laying flat for 5 minutes before they take it that will increase its accuracy. And with planning and determination it's possible to make sure someone who can access your port is available before any appointment where that's necessary (or talk to the nurses at your onc's office). When they say they \"have to\" it's almost always their excuse for not wanting to take the trouble to keep you safe. If you develop lymphedema from it, not only won't they even know about it, but it sure as heck won't be them with the fat arm. So if you'd rather not take that risk, you're entitled to stand your ground. blue16, I do hope your friend's healthcare team will get creative about finding a less risky way to deal with her herceptin. Because of our bc treatments, there can be as much as 30% more fluid in our arm (or chest) tissues than is normal before any swelling is even noticable, so an at-risk arm can already be lymph-compromised well before diagnosis of lymphedema is possible. Besides possibly triggering lymphedema, an infusion can well be inefficient at distributing the infused drugs because of the backed-up lymph flow. So even technically, it's an unsound practice to use that arm for infusions. Which explains, Pam, why even careful disinfecting of an infusion site is not entirely effective -- the infused fluid itself can overwhelm the lymph system just by its sheer volume. It's so cheering to hear so many of you talk about sticking to your guns and educating your sluggish medical teams to be aware of our risk. Hopefully the newbies traveling this road behind us will face less lymphedema risk because of you! Hear! Hear! Binney ",

At the moment, I've gotta say it sounds like a bad sunburn, but you're right that lymphedema may be a concern. Just in case, do try to keep your arm elevated as much as possible (supported, not just holding it up in the air -- and on pillows at night). Also stay REALLY well hydrated, and pause throughout the day to take in a few deep, abdominal breaths (that helps to stimulate the lymph system.) Whether this is lymphedema or not, it would be a great idea to get a referral from anyone on your medical team to a well-trained lymphedema therapist. S/he can evaluate your situation (and yes, BTW, your dominant side would normally be slightly larger than your non-dominant side), give you some risk reduction tips, and fit you for a sleeve and glove you can wear for travel and exercise. [A word of warning, here: strange as it may seem, compression garments DO NOT protect from sunburn, so always protect yourself from sunburn when wearing them!!] Here's a page about finding a well-trained therapist near you: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... Because of the damage a sunburn can cause, do be especially watchful for any signs of infection, like fever, new redness or swelling, increased pain, itching, warmth to the touch.

There was an article published recently regarding IVs and bloodwork on an at-risk arm, from a study done in Sweden, and it showed that there was indeed a risk from those things -- about 6% of women developed some swelling following those procedures. But the researchers (who were nurses) concluded that the risk to a \"few\" women was not enough to justify the clinical inconvenience of having to avoid the arm when they wanted to draw blood or place an IV. They also concluded that women should not be told about their risk because it would make them anxious. That is possibly the study your doctor is referring to. As patients, we're more than entitled to draw very different conclusions: if WE find ourselves in that 6% that have to deal with the distress, disability and disfigurement of lymphedema for the rest of our lives, then the problem of their inconvenience is really not even worth considering.

She now has this new pump business, and she claims there has been research done with it to show its effectiveness, but she has yet to produce the results. I have heard her brag that the engineers she hired to create her pump had never even heard of lymphedema, which she says is an advantage because that way they'd have fresh ideas. Helloooo?!! Lymphedema is a whole lot more than a plumbing problem, so if it were me, I'd want a pump developed by people with a passion for LE and a deep working knowledge of its dynamics. Just by way of balancing this rant, I will say that I have seen a therapist who was trained by her who actually became an excellent practitioner, principally because she's the sort who keeps on learning on her own. All that just to say you might want to do your own research on this. As far as the research is concerned, Flexi has a lot behind it. No pump is standard treatment--they are just a substitute for home self-MLD. Therapists should be doing hands-on MLD during LE treatment appointments, not relying on pumps. We're paying for their skill and experience, which can only be of help to us if they're using their own hands to assess and manipulate our actual skin and tissues. Like I say, JMHO. Binney",

His wife had bc and LE, and he used his skills to come up with a comfortable fix for her. He was also responsible for starting either Solaris or JoviPak (I forget which, but the other of the two broke off from that first one). He left Solaris a few years ago to start Telesto. \"Bygrace\" would know more, because she met him at her LE fashion show awhile ago and has a garment he made for her before this new company was up and running. (If there's ever a TV game show about LE trivia, I might be able to make my fortune, don't you think? Geesh!) I'm hoping to attend the NLN conference in August, where Telesto, Solaris, and JoviPak will all have reps (and booths, and probably a supply of free inkpens or whatever), so I intend to make a study of all of them and see if a direction for my next garment comes clear. It's not like these things are a bargain, after all! I'll go see if I can find bygrace to help us out here.

Unfortunately, lymphedema massage (Manual Lymph Drainage, or MLD) and wrapping are not do-it-yourself. That's because learning the proper pressure, direction, and order of the massage is very critical and it depends on your own individual needs -- for instance, whether there is fibrosis or scarring present, what kind of surgery you've had, and the condition of the skin. Only a therapist can assess your particular needs and help you learn a technique that is workable for you. The point of the wrapping (which must be done with the proper pressure throughout or it will do more harm than good) is to help reduce the swelling by promoting lymph vessel function. Exercising or even just the ordinary movements of daily living help the wrapping work, but it also works well at night. Like Manual Lymph Drainage, this can only be taught in person, one-on-one with a really good therapist. The sleeves and gauntlet that you order are only for use AFTER the initial therapy (regular MLD and wrapping by a well-trained therapist). They don't reduce the swelling but only help maintain the reduction that happens with therapy. When you already have swelling in your hand a gauntlet is a bad idea, because it will cause the lymph fluid to be trapped in your fingers, where it is very difficult to get it out. And any sleeve that does not fit well on ANY PART of your arm will make matters worse, as the compression needs to be greater farther from your axilla and less as it moves up the arm. If it's looser at your wrist and then tighter in your forearm that will trap fluid around your wrist. When the off-the-shelf garments don't fit, it's time to be fitted for custom garments. BUT, again, that is only after you've had the therapy by a well-qualified therapist. Early stage lymphedema does sometimes reduce and then swell again. This is the stage where it is VERY IMPORTANT to begin therapy, because otherwise it will progress and produce fibrosis (hardening of the tissues inside) and more serious skin changes that may then be permanent. Please don't let that happen, as it's discouraging and disabling and will eventually affect your arm strength and range of motion. The achiness and pain are early indications of a need to get help with draining the stagnant lymph fluid and keeping it reduced and healthy. This will not only feel better and be much easier to manage, but it will help prevent the cellulitis infections that are so common in lymphedema. Here's a page of information about how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Hang in there -- there's help for this, and it makes a BIG difference.

I think you'll both be delighted to know that lymphedema is treated without drugs or even surgery, in ways that help our bodies repair damage already done and prevent further stress. That said, I gotta tell you that 22 lymph nodes removed is a lot of lymph nodes, and three surgeries of whatever description also amounts to considerable opportunity for scarring that can block lymph flow. In short, Lynda is indeed at risk for lymphedema of her arm and her chest (called truncal lymphedema). Seeing as how you're both completely serious about researching and receiving the best of care for you, it would seem like a great idea for her to find a well-qualified lymphedema (LE) therapist close by and make an appointment for: an evaluation baseline arm measurements instruction in prophylactic Manual Lymph Drainage massage (MLD) instruction in risk reduction practices measurements for a sleeve and glove that she can live with to use when exercising, traveling, and any strenuous activity The fact that she was in good physical condition before surgery is helpful, but is no guarantee of missing this particular bullet. The risk will remain for life, and there is some evidence that damage to the lymph system is cumulative, so doing something risky without developing LE once, or twice, or fifty times will not assure that it won't develop the next time. Being active and valuing her health, flexibility, and stamina, Lynda DOES NOT want lymphedema, which is distressing, disfiguring, and very often disabling. Doctors do not generally receive training in diagnosing or treating LE, and they often downplay the risk and the reality. Not all therapists who call themselves LE therapists have the training to treat it adequately or even correctly. So you both need to take on that self-advocacy role with LE that you've honed through the bc experience. Here are a couple of places to start: Position Papers of the National Lymphedema Network, www.lymphnet.org A list of links for locating a QUALIFIED LE therapist near you, www.mylymphedema.com If we can help, tell us how.

First, a visit to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for instruction in Manual Lymph Drainage (lymphatic massage) and fitting for a sleeve and glove or gauntlet (for exercise, travel or any strenuous activity) would still be an excellent idea. Then, if you sense any \"funny\" feelings in that arm or notice any new swelling, tingling, heaviness or achiness, you'll have a way to deal with it. And second, there are lots of PTs and OTs out there with \"experience in LE\" that really have not been thoroughly trained. And since it's such a complicated condition and deals with a unique and little-understood body system, that thorough training is important to your future well being. If you're not sure about his/her training, ask. And don't hesitate to get a second opinion if necessary. I'm sure hoping you never again have a moment's worry about LE! Lexislove, what a cute avatar! Who's the adorable little bug? Your very best (safest, happiest) bet is to find a well-qualified lymphedema therapist near you (there's a site mentioned in a post above about how to find one), get a referral, and pop in for a visit and evaluation. S/he'll take baseline arm measurements, teach you some risk reduction practices, and if necessary begin therapy to get it and under control and keep it that way. Please do keep us posted, and let us know how we can help. Gentle hugs to you both, Binney",

Doesn't last as long as the short stretch bandages, obviously, but it does many, many wraps before it gives out. I toss them into a lingerie bag, then run them over the top of a folding chair, smoothing them with my fingers as I go. I hang them, all smoothed out, from the shower curtain rod to dry -- doesn't take long at all.  If you wrap very often and toss out the finger bandages every time it could begin to make a dent in the budget. (I've heard of women ironing them with very low heat after washing, but that seems pretty extreme to me!) When I get new short stretch bandages I write the date on that hard little end with a magic marker (Jennifer gave us that hint a long time ago, and I think of her whenever I do it!) Helps a lot when you have several sets from different times and need to know which ones are ready to be retired. I write the date I get them on the tag of my garments too.

This is not MLD and not intended for a compromised lymph system. We require gradient compression on our arms to move the fluid upward against gravity, otherwise we risk pooling. For those with a fully-operating lymph system pooling isn't the issue it is for us. As we saw in an earlier telecast, Dr. Oz is just about clueless where LE is concerned, so we can be pretty sure he's only referring to this pop phenomenon. Simple compression does help reduce pain in arthritic joints, though, and that's all the advertisers of these shirts are claiming. Be well! Binney",

You put one end of it UP under the ring and leave a short amount sticking out. Then take the OTHER end of the long string and wrap it around your finger just above the ring, moving up your finger with every wrap so the wraps lie right next to each other, hopefully up past the knuckle. Then start gently but firmly (and slowly) pulling the SHORT end. It'll gradually unwrap the string and go around and around your finger, hopefully moving the ring up over the wrapped string. Is that any better? The thing you want to avoid at all costs is irritating the skin, which can become an infection risk. So don't do it if your skin gets bothered. Definitely need to remove the sleeve if you don't have a glove, Brenda, so the sleeve doesn't push more fluid into your hand and fingers. Since finances are a problem, you might try something less expensive until you can afford a glove. An isotoner might help, for instance. Also, try keeping your arm elevated as much as possible, even at night on a pillow. If you can get the finger swelling reduced you can remove the rings. Extreme temperatures (like icing your hand) should be avoided too, as it may reduce the swelling briefly, but then it'll swell worse. We've had a couple of discussions here about wedding rings. Because my swelling is well controlled, I wear mine under my glove, but I take it off when traveling or doing other things that might give me trouble. Other women have them sized larger, have a clasp attached to the back, or wear it on a chain around their neck. Lymphedema's nasty. Be well! Binney",

Usually, though, if five or six weeks of treatment don't solve the problem you're fitted for compression garments to maintain the loss, and treatment is suspended for a few months to give everybody a rest (well, actually to give your lymph system a break, I think, but enough is enough anyhow!) Then after a few months you start in again, and most of the time see real improvement after a rest. (Often, if you use compression garments during the day and wrapping at night after active treatment stops you'll continue to see improvement, even if it's very gradual). The fact that you've seen so much improvement with treatment  is a good sign that you can expect further reduction down the road. Before stopping for a break, be sure you've been taught well how to do self-MLD and wrapping. That way you have some control when you overdo it, or overheat, or the weather changes, or whatever may make your LE flare. Very nice feeling to have all those tools in your own hands! Some of the gals here have talked about some unresolvable swelling that remains after everything has been tried (Jennifer comes to mind). As long as you are careful to maintain your arm as it is and not allow it to continue to swell, that's the best and safest thing to do. All of us with LE are in danger from systemic infection at the slightest provocation (a paper cut, for Pete's sake!), so carry those antiseptic wipes, bandaids and  topical antibiotic with you, and ask your doctor for oral antibiotics to have on hand for quick response to infection. Actually, MLD massage by a well-trained therapist and wrapping are generally more effective at resolving stubborn swelling than a pump. Chip bags or shaped pieces of foam included in the wrapping over those stubborn places can sometimes break up fibrosis and soften the area to promote good lymph drainage. Ask your therapist about trying some option: \"chocolate bars\", \"spaghetti foam\" and shaped grey foam are some of the choices. (I'm not making that up, either!) If you \"graduate\" from wrapping to compression garments, be sure to continue with the wrapping at night and see if the swelling gradually resolves. In other words, you sound like you're doing really well. Congrats on the progress -- hang in there! Be well! Binney",

Most people think of lymphedema as swelling in the arm, but the swelling can be in the breast or chest, back, side, shoulder or axilla as well. Usually (but not always) it's more painful when it's on the trunk than when it's just in the arm. The hardness also goes along with lymphedema sometimes, as the swelling makes the tissues feel hard and full. I hope she can get into the lymphedema clinic for an evaluation soon, as it's helpful and reassuring to get a firm diagnosis and get started on treatment (which is gentle and non-invasive, by the way!) Lynda, being an RN doesn't necessarily make a therapist better qualified, but the LANA after her name means she's had at least 135 hours of specifically LE training. RN's can no longer be paid by insurance for LE therapy so most RN therapists are out of business. You're lucky yours is still working. Let us know how it goes! Just because we all need to know these things, let me explain that a couple of years ago a lobby group sponsored by the PT professional association (APTA) managed to get RNs and MTs disqualified as therapists for insurance purposes, even those who are fully trained to provide LE therapy. This rotten and self-serving move eliminated a great many well-trained therapists and closed many clinics across the country, especially in rural areas, making it harder for patients to find good care. PTs support this sort of destructive legislation because they want to be the only ones who provide this service and because they DON'T want to have to get the additional 135 hours of specifically LE training in order to do it. (The OTs have their own fairly strong lobby, which is why the PTs couldn't get them eliminated as well.) And here's the rub: the PTs have now attacked the new H.R. 4662 legislation that originally contained provisions to reinstate RNs and MTs as therapists and to demand the full135-hour training. Our \"advocates\" who are attempting to push the legislation in D.C. have buckled to their pressure on these points. The new proposals for this legislation have been watered down to suit the PTs, not the patient needs. I'm still in support of the original wording, but it seems to me the watered-down version is potentially more damaging to us than no legislation at all. JMHO, Binney",

You're not jumping the gun! You can wake up from surgery with lymphedema or develop it 15 or 20 years later, so the timing is no issue at all.  As for there being only six nodes removed, several of us here had fewer than that or developed it after prophylactic mastectomy with no axillary nodes removed.  The fact that your arm \"feels funny\" is more than enough reason to request an evaluation by a well-qualified LE therapist (like the one you found). It will either start you on the right foot toward LE risk reduction if you don't have it yet, or get you started on LE treatment promptly, which is the very best way to control it on into the future. Win/win! There aren't any tests to determine if you have these conditions (if you have AWS you may be able to see or feel the \"cords\"), but sometimes doctors do tests to determine it's not something else (doppler to rule out blood clots or imaging to rule out tumors for instance). A well-trained lymphedema therapist will be able to tell you if it is by history and physical exam. I can't think of any questions to ask your onco's nurse, because she's not the medical professional who treats this. But do let us know what she has to say. Be well! Binney",

It takes longer to work up your strength this way, but it can be done safely and effectively. Stay well hydrated too. What's really hard about this is stopping.

It's almost impossible for me to stop, so I go faster and try to get it done before it does any more damage. Which is nuts, of course, but I don't think clearly when I'm in that situation. I'm getting better about it, but that's just because I've caused myself grief enough times that I KNOW I don't want to do that again. Geesh! Does that help any? Hope so! Do enjoy the class! Binney",

The guilt? Well, I truly don't believe that I'm alone out there. I don't think that I'm the only one who feels the guilt that only a caregiver can feel. I'm 28 years old, and I take care of my mother who is 58. She has stage three lymphedema. It's difficult for me to see her the way she is, especially since she was always a rock. She didn't gave in to being sick, always fought everything, and I never seen her cry. I'm angry now; I'm angry because this disease has taken my mother from me, and while she's still here physically, a good part of her has been taken away. I feel guilty for being angry. I feel guilty for wishing that she was different. I'm jealous of my older sister, because my mother was able to play with her children, and now that I have my own one year old child, she cannot play with my son. She can hold him and verbally interact with him, but it's not the same. She can't run after him, or tickle him, or just be with him the way I know she wants to be with him. I'm angry with myself for feeling this way, but I know that it's alright to feel this way. I know that I can feel angry and jealous, because I'm not jealous or angry with her, the person with lymphedema, but rather I'm angry with and jealous of the disease itself. Lymphedema is a selfish, cruel, ugly thing that threatens my mother everyday, daring her to take a faithful step outside. A bug bite, a scratch, a knick of anything can make her world a nightmare. So yes, I do believe that guilt is the perfect title for this article. By Crystal Bass Type of Lymphedema: My mother suffers from Primary Lymphedema Maybe that's helpful. I'm sure the feelings are more complex than that, but it's a good start on understanding. Be well, Binney PS - For those unfamiliar with Primary LE, it's a congenital condition that can appear at birth or at any point in life, often in the teen years but also can show up in later adulthood. It can, and does, sometimes take years or even decades for Primary Lymphers to get a diagnosis and medical help -- and we thought WE had trouble getting a diagnosis!",

      "Content": "Oct 11, 2008 04:46PM Binney4 wrote: Hi, Lorena, Sorry about the \"swell\" hand and fingers! I'm wonderiing if your PT was also a fully qualified LE therapist. That'd be someone with at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her/his PT certification, and a year's experience treating LE. Since no state currently enforces training standards for LE therapists it can be hard for us to find one with the knowledge and experience to treat it adequately. In other words, I'm wondering if you had Complete Decongestive Therapy (massage, wrapping, skin care, exercise, LE care instruction), which would be the protocol for your situation. LE is staged, like bc is, and without proper treatment it will progress to a more advanced stage. That doesn't necessarily mean more swelling, but it does mean internal tissue damage from the presence of too much protein in the lymph fluid, which will result in hardening (fibrosis), further lymph blockage, much higher risk of serious infection, and eventual loss of both strength and range of motion. So \"mild\" LE needs to be treated seriously, even if it doesn't seem to bother you much. As otter notes, that would include (preferably) wrapping of your arm for exercise sessions. Not only will wrapping protect your arm from further swelling, but it will actively reduce the swelling in your hand and fingers as you exercise. Win/win! Recent research is showing that no particular weight limit needs to apply, but as otter says, the progression should be very gradual -- no strain or stress to the arm, backing off at once if the arm feels tired, tingly, or achy. A compression sleeve should not be worn without a glove if you already have some swelling in your hand, as it can cause fluid to be trapped in your hand. As for blood pressure, that can be a real problem (it's how my LE started in my left arm), but you'd know that within a couple of days. When I first got a medic-alert for LE it was to remind MYSELF not to let that arm be used! The habits (and freedoms) of a lifetime can't be changed overnight, for sure. More information in the position papers on Exercise and Therapy (also one on therapist training) at the National Lymphedema Network: www.lymphnet.org Be well! Binney",

The reason is that if you should develop swelling in your arm, the sleeve could push it into your hand, where it's even harder to deal with. Here's an excellent short article about using hand protection along with arm sleeves: http://lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gauntletandsleeve/ And here are the guidelines for air travel from the National Lymphedema Network, an organization of lymphology professionals: http://www.lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlnairtravel.pdf The LymphNet.org site also offers general guidelines for lymphedema risk reduction, and for protecting yourself when exercising. Any compression garments used for lymphedema protection need to be VERY well-fitted. Best bet is to get help with fitting from a well-trained lymphedema therapist (who can also do an evaluation, take baseline arm measurements for future reference, and give you personalized risk reduction tips.) Here's a page with pictures illustrating what to look for in a good garment fit, so you can judge the fit before you buy: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm Happy travels, and may you never have any \"swell\" days, ever!

Having a bit of a problem with them myself at the moment and was thinking of posting to ask if anyone else is, or if it's just me. Here's a brief run-down of my current mess. My fitter says night garments usually last about two years, so since I got mine in October of '05 I decided to order a new one last July, giving us all time to get the new one just right by October of '07. (And, yes, it's the elbows that are giving out on me too , though I find that if move the little foam chips around a bit with my fingers I can get that area puffed up again. Takes a bit of finessing and a lot of patience ). I'll make this real brief: the fitter just called this week to tell me it's finally ready. Nearly a year later. I haven't gone in to get it yet because this'll be the fourth time around trying to get it right and I don't hold out a lot of hope for them. The customer service varies GREATLY depending on who you talk to (Liz is helpful, but, uh...let's just say not everyone there is). There seems to be a lot of disorganization, too, with one person not knowing what the other is doing. We remeasured (of course) when we first ordered it last July, but the item we got back had little resemblance to the specifications. Nearly a year later I'm less than eager to see what they've sent back this time. But I'm going to pick it up tomorrow, and I'm going to ask what the billing date is on this for my insurance, because as soon as decently possible I plan to order a new one from JoviPak or TelestoMedtech. (In all fairness, one delay was on my part, not sending it back right away the third time because I broke my leg and just couldn't deal with it. Not an excuse, exactly, but at least an explanation.) This doesn't even sound like me, does it? Usually I have a lot of patience and respect for the folks that help us by designing garments. And I've worked really happily and successfully with Solaris in years past. But frankly I'm thoroughly exasperated with this. The last time my fitter sent it back to them was in March, and to me three months delay after all this hassle is inexcusable. So tomorrow I'll come tell you how it goes. Maybe they'll redeem themselves and I'll be singing their praises, but at the moment I can only say, either order now and hope for delivery before this time next year, or check out another supplier.

I'm not sure from your post if you've already seen a PT for your arm, or whether you have a glove as well as a sleeve (or perhaps a sleeve with attached glove?) At any rate, if you have no glove, for sure don't wear just the sleeve. There are a few things you can do for relief and to limit further swelling until you can see the therapist for help. Since your arm seems to be involved as well, keeping it elevated as much as possible (at night on pillows, too) may help, but wearing a sleeve that's already aggravating the chest swelling is probably not a good idea. Instead, you might try one of those tight sport shirts like bike racers wear, long sleeved (here in the States they're called something like BodyArmor). Get one a size smaller than you'd normally wear, for gentle compression, and wear it inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin or block lymph flow. If it helps, wear it at night as well. Limit any strenuous activity until you start therapy, but do practice deep abdominal breathing throughout the day, and simple arm exercises like raising your arm and making cat-clawing motions. Avoid heat and hot water (hot showers or baths, dishwater, hot packs, spas), and be extra careful not to damage the skin in any way: burns, hangnails, paper cuts, insect bites, sunburn. Use a good lotion on your arm and chest a couple of times a day to keep the skin moisturized. Watch for any redness on your arm or chest, and warmth to the touch, fever, or itching, as these can indicate infection. If anything like that appears get to the doctor or ER at once, as infection is a big problem with uncontrolled lymphedema, and it spreads quickly. Hopefully others will be along soon with ideas I've forgotten to add. But I just wanted to say that this can be distressing and depressing, and I really want to encourage you that with good therapy you'll soon have all the knowledge and skills you need to take back control over your life. Hang in there! Be well, Alyson! Binney ",

I hope that's encouraging to you rather than alarming. We really shouldn't have to live in pain that limits our activities. Momine, any bc surgery carries some risk for lymphedema -- I have bilateral lymphedema with a single node removed on the cancer side, and a prophylactic mastectomy with no nodes purposely removed on the other.

I'd say about half-way through the day I need to give my Bio-Cons a tug back into place, but we're only talking a fraction of an inch slippage. Otherwise, they stay where I put them. So there's hope, deblem! On the other hand, I still find ripping them off at the end of the day a great and glorious moment. Definitely love/hate here. Thanks for the opportunity to shriek a bit. I feel much better now, and hope you will too when you get this nasty business solved. Keep looking...well...UP! Binney ",

One of the experts is Kathryn Schmitz, a reasearcher who's done a lot with exercise for lymphedema prevention. You'll both find it interesting, I think. I just have to ask about the ACE bandages. Since you've seen a lymphedema therapist I'm assuming she taught your wife the wrapping technique, right? And you're really talking about short-stretch bandages that look like the ACE bandages but aren't? The reason I ask is because when flying, ACE bandages are far more likely to cause lymphedema than to prevent it. They just aren't the right tool for the job. I'm impressed with your combined marathon and triathlon triumphs! Bravo! Here's to no swelling, ever! Binney ",

There's under-layering involved, as well as gradient compression with special short-stretch bandages. These apply the correct kind of pressure to the skin which allows for the muscles below to pump lymph fluid more effectively. (The lymph system, as you probably realize, has a vasculature as extensive as the circulatory system, but without a pump of any sort like the heart. Lymph is \"pumped\" in part by the action of the muscles against the pressure of the skin.) ACE bandages can be useful in preventing or controlling edema after sprains or other injuries, but in LE they can strangle the lymph vessels, which lie directly under the skin. With a compromised lymph system you don't want to do that. A fully-trained LE therapist can teach LE wrapping, and with Lynda's experience it should be fairly easy to learn.",

Just curious, as it's nearly impossible to learn without some hands-on, but there are a lot of therapists out there who are not making the time/effort to do that. If you've had bilateral surgeries (don't know if you have or not), you don't want to move the fluid from the bc side to the \"good\" side, because both are at risk. There are several good lymphedema therapist training schools, and they each have their own unique take on this, though they all do basically the same thing about clearing nodes, then massaging the chest, etc. The differences come in the kind of strokes used (though all have to be very gentle). There is even one very good school that recommends that their patients not do self-mld at all, because we so often get it wrong anyway -- whether we forget a step or two, or we go too fast (the lymph system has a very slow rhythm), or we press too hard when we get frustrated or hurried. The issue really is, which works best for you? Two things to consider: which is more effective at reducing swelling, and which are you more likely to be able to pull off every day on an on-going basis. Keeping up this routine over time is a big part of the challenge, so we do need to be realistic about what we can actually do. There are a number of \"short-cut\" routines that help some women (and not others). For instance, using the first three sections of the Lebed exercise DVD is as effective for me as doing self-mld, but it may not be that way for others. For some, several short versions (that include node clearing and a few key massage strokes and/or some deep breathing or exercises) throughout the day work better than one (or two) whole self-mld routines. And just as an aside, therapists call self-mld \"Simple Manual Lymph Drainage\" or SMLD, but I sorta resent the term -- nothing simple about it! Others will no doubt be along with their own versions of mld coping. Be well! Binney",

The bc.org April on-line conference is about LE and exercise, with Kathryn Schmitz, who has done all that recent exercise research. Should be very helpful to all of us. Water aerobics are the best, but don't do anything that strains your arm. Grace and AZDarleen both swear by the water aerobics, but Darleen tells me she has to modify some of the exercises or work up to them slowly. There's some research going on now to help determine why some people get LE and others don't, and hopefully that will help us to be able to make better risk assessments for each individual. Some researchers are looking at genetic factors, some at ways of assessing the state of the lymphatics even before bc treatment, and some at other possible factors like inflammatory response. Still others are working on better assessment measures (like bioimpedence measures) that can detect the presence of intracellular fluid even before any swelling appears. That would certainly help women keep their LE in managable shape. There's a lot of hope on the horizon. Now all we have to do is educate our docs and nurses...! Be well, Binney ",

Katey, you only mention elevation, so I'm wondering if you've had recent help from a well-trained lymphedema therapist. Unless you've already learned Manual Lymph Drainage, self-bandaging, directed exercises and therapeutic skin care, you need more \"tools\" to deal with your lymphedema than you currently have. It's a progressive condition -- it's staged just like breast cancer is. The stages don't have to do with the size of our arms, but with damage going on inside our bodies -- inflammation, fibrosis formation, abnormal fat deposition, further lymph blockage, loss of strength and range of motion, and greater risk of serious systemic infection. The progression is slow, but in later stages elevation will no longer work to reduce the swelling, and fibrosis will make the needed therapy more strenuous. Good therapy now will save grief down the road. Blood pressure readings from the leg are higher than the arm, but if you do it regularly at first you can establish your own baseline, and then you'll have a way to track your blood pressure. You do need to be lying flat for a few minutes before they take your leg bp, or it's simply a useless exercise. Your call, of course, but the lymphedema in my left arm (one node removed) started with a blood pressure reading on that arm, and all I can tell you is, bilateral LE is a real bear to deal with. If you call the labs they'll invariably tell you they can't do a foot draw. But if you show up with the blood test order sheet in hand and \"Draw from foot only\" written on it by the ordering office, they'll almost always do it. At my lab I have a phlebotomist who does it regularly, and she often has other staff members watch to learn how to do it. The last time, the new tech watched and looked confused. She said, \"But I didn't see you do anything different from the way we do it on an arm. What's different about it?\" To which my tech answered, \"Nothing, except it's a lot easier on the foot because the veins are bigger.\" So -- no mystery there, just ignorance! I do ask to lie down for blood draws -- easier on the tech too so she doesn't have to bend over to get to my feet. Make sure your foot is warm, drink loads of water, and if it's okay with your doctor take an aspirin the day before. Go for it! Be well! Binney",

Sending you hugs, hot cyber cocoa, a box of cyber-kleenex, and maybe a sisterly giggle or two afterward. How do you know if it's too tight -- hmmm. Well, a little pinker may be just fine, but real red, or white, or purple are not good. Tingling, like your fingers are asleep -- not good. If the tips swell, that's also time to re-wrap. Do exercise some while you're wrapped: reaches with your arms, elbow bends, wrist twists, cat-claw motions with your fingers. If your fingernails turn blue, then it's too tight. One other way to judge:  if your arm or hand swells pretty quickly after you remove the wraps, it was probably too tight. Looser next time! Part of the problem is that you have to make the compression less as you go up the arm, so what's too tight in one area may be just right a little further down.  As you so aptly say, this ain't easy. Good news is, it does get easier with practice. And the loneliness and distress get easier with time too. And there IS some satisfaction when you get it right, and you look at it and see it's a great job and you've actually gained the skill you need to take your life back into your own hands. So watch for that golden moment and pause to celebrate it, because we deserve to appreciate the fruits of our struggles! Be well, tj! Binney",

I'm not sure how your therapist does it, but I'll describe how I do, and maybe that'll help. You've got the stockinette and some Artifllex (or foam) on your hand, right? Okay. Put your hand out in front of you with the palm toward the floor. Spread your fingers apart so you don't squish them all together when you wrap them. Take the short-stretch roll in your other hand and begin to unroll it across the top of your wrist TOWARD YOUR BODY, not away from you. Go around your wrist at least twice to make sure that little bugger end stays in there. (Don't yank it tight in an effort to keep the end from unraveling because with the hand wrap it's the LAYERS that create the compression you need, not tugging it tight.) Once it's good and secure, as you come up around your wrist, move the roll up so it unrolls across the back of your hand and goes down between your thumb and first finger. Go slow and remember to keep your fingers spread. Continue across your palm, and when it comes up on the other side of your hand go around your wrist again. Then when it comes up, go around between thumb and first finger again. Then around the wrist. Then around between the thumb and first finger. And on and on... As for going up your arm, I try to imagine there's a line down the center of the short-stretch (actually they do sell them with lines printed on them, but I can't remember where I saw that). As I wrap up my arm I lay each round on the row before it with its edge on that imaginary line. So the overlap of each wrap-around is exactly one-half the width of the bandage. Rolling up bandages makes me crazy, so my husband took pity on me and bought a rechargable electric screw driver. On the base of the Phillips-head attachment he brazed on a length of welding rod so it runs parallel to the screw driver shaft just a fraction of an inch away from it. I insert the end of a bandage between the rod and the shaft and push the on button and it winds up the bandage for me. Saves a few tears of frustration here and there. Clear as mud, right?

Some therapists supply you with the first set, which will last throughout the therapy intensive and a bit beyond. By then you'll be an old hand at it and know how to order on-line and not have to run to the medical supply place. If your fingers are wrapped, the finger gauze doesn't last as long as the arm and hand bandages, but you'll still have enough time to order them on-line before you need to replace them. Most insurance doesn't cover bandages, but it doesn't hurt to check. Everything's washable, but you need a lingerie bag so they don't wrap themselves around the washer thingy. (Does that sound like the voice of experience speaking? Does that sound like \"duh!\"? Well, yes, on both counts.) otter, I was so hoping you wouldn't get LE too! Not ever! I wish we lived close and I could hug you for real, but short of that I really do want to reassure you that once you have things back in control, and the skills you need to keep it that way, it'll be even easier than having to worry that you might get it. The massage is wonderful, so do relax and enjoy it. Learn to do it yourself and do it right, with soft lighting, your favorite music and a peaceful mind and heart. The wrapping is bizarre, but doggone if it doesn't work like a charm. And the precautions really do become second nature. You can do this, otter. It'll be good! Hugs, prayers, Binney",

When cording is on the trunk it's usually called Mondor's Disease rather than Axillary Web Syndrome (when it's in the axilla and arm). It's believed to be a thrombosed vein rather than a lymph vessel, though that's what they thought AWS was too until they actually studied it and found it involved lymph vessels. The literature says it's self-limiting and doesn't need any treatment except simple pain relievers, but I'm wondering if a lymphedema therapist with experience in treating AWS would be able to help bring relief of this as well. Kira, do you know? Bottom line, it appears that it goes away in a month or two. Happens after any breast surgery, even without cancer, so it's not really cancer-related, just surgery-related.

But I'm not quite understanding your question. Are you doing a Therapy Intensive with a lymphedema therapist? That'd mean four or five days a week of therapeutic massage and wrapping for a couple of weeks or longer. If that's what you're doing, then the therapist will be expecting you to wear the wrapping until you shower right before your next appointment. That's the quickest and most effective way to reduce the swelling and get some alternative lymph routes opened up and functioning. After the therapy reduces the swelling as far as it will go, you can be fitted for daytime compression garments and, if you like, with a different kind of night garment to wear instead of the bandages. It's lots more comfortable and convenient. (But the swelling has to be down first before you can be fitted for it). It's perfectly understandable that you wouldn't want to wear the bandages that long, and I can sure identify with that feeling. But if you're not going to do it, then your best bet would be to talk it over with your therapist. Maybe she'd have some ideas on a compromise, like more self-massage, or sleeping with your arm elevated on pillows, or rewrapping twice during the day and only removing the wrapping while you sleep. After all we've been through already it's really hard to take this on too. We sometimes just need some time to get our bearings and make the decisions that are best for US. Patty, this is about YOU, and you are worth a whole lot of effort and inconvenience to make sure you're as well and as safe as you can be. Wrapping is the pits because lymphedema is the pits, but the best way to get your life back in your own hands is to do the therapy as quickly and effectively as you can. And that means wrapping at night. So, grim as this is, Patty, if you've got a good therapist, work with her. The therapy ends, even if it seems like it never will, and you end up with far more convenient and comfortable ways to control the lymphedema and move on with your life. Hang tough!  Binney ",

Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm I have recently developed lymphedema in one leg, with no treatment to the leg at all. The lymph system is divided into quadrants, and generally we experience lymphedema only in the treated quadrant. But recent research is suggesting that a compromised lymph system in one quadrant reduces the transport capacity of the other quadrants as well. Also, it's always possible to develop lymphedema (especially in the leg) at any age, and from any kind of trauma if we have a genetically determined less-than-robust lymphatic system. Researchers are now theorizing that those of us who develop lymphedema after cancer treatment (surgery or rads) were at high risk genetically to begin with. So, very possibly lymphedema, especially since your doctors have gone to the trouble of ruling out other causes. Do keep us posted, and tell us how we can help! Gentle hugs, Binney",

The Act says that lymphedema has to be covered in accordance with the policies of your insurance policy. So if your insurance will pay for x number of PT visits a year you can apply them all to a lymphedema therapist. But if you need more than that your insurance is not obliged by this law to pay for more. The co-pay is also set by your insurance policy, and it can be prohibitively high (until recently mine was $40 per visit for therapy, so a 4-week Intensive would cost me around $800 out-of-pocket). In the same way, as KT points out, it matters how your insurance categorizes your garments. In my case, they're DME, which my policy pays for at 100%, so I sure as heck don't want them to put them in some other category. But this all depends on the individual policy. Medicare generally pays for therapy and (ironically) some LE pumps, but it does not currently cover garments AT ALL. If you need help with appealing for insurance coverage for LE, you can contact the National Lymphedema Network's adviser and advocate, Robert Weiss at: LymphActivist@aol.com There is a new bill in the House that will mandate insurance coverage for lymphedema, as well as provide standards for lymphedema therapists and training for doctors. PLEASE email or write (or call) your Congressman to ask him/her to co-sponsor this bill. We also need a Senator to introduce a Senate version of the bill in the U.S. Senate, so PLEASE also write to your senators and urge them to do that.

Also, gravity plays a role with LE, which is why we always recommend elevating the arm whenever possible instead of letting it hang down. That said, some women can get away with lying a bit over on their side while keeping their arm out from under their body, not pulled up under their side, head, or pillow. Not an easy distinction to make when you're sound asleep! :( So, a couple of thoughts. You can try putting a pillow slightly under that side of you to discourage the urge to roll over on that side in your sleep. Or perhaps you can sleep on your back without trouble if you make sure only your head, not your shoulders, is on the pillow, and put a couple of pillows under your knees as well to ease your lower back. On the StepUp-SpeakOut site there are pictures of ways to prop your arm with pillows as you lie on your \"good\" side. They're here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm#sleeping%20positions Making life-style changes when you're sound asleep can be next to impossible! I hope others will be along with their suggestions. Sigh! Binney",

We do not have the same slant on this (obviously!) and we tend to give \"negative impressions\" that researchers and PTs wouldn't think of mentioning. The fact that the article therefore resonates with patients and makes them feel acknowledged is lost on professionals, who would prefer to keep the picture of LE clean and clinical. A huge THANK YOU to the article author, Ranit Mishori, for her courage in telling our story instead of theirs! And to the Washington Post for letting her do it! Now then -- we need to hear from the NLN's Medical Advisory Board, because the point of all this is to draw these two varying viewpoints together in such a way that it furthers our mutual trust and respect for one another. That is purportedly the NLN's mission as well, so their jumping in here will go a long way toward that goal.

He helps with appeals after a denial, and does not charge for his services (because he's an angel, apparently). Reach him at LymphActivist [at] aol [dot] com  If he's traveling it'll take him a few days to answer, but his help is invaluable.

A workshop at the NLN medical conference I attended was all about making therapists comfortable with treating Stage IV patients, and I was surprised it even had to be addressed, but there it is. You'll need to be a bit more assertive about what you want here. Smile, but be firm and repeat your goals as often as necessary. We've got your back! With a three-day lapse in treatment you can either leave the wrapping on for the three days (not ideal, since with reduction the wraps will loosen), or you might talk to her about a Circaid or FarrowWrap garment up front, because they're easier to don and adjustable. JoviPak makes a \"night garment\" called an Inna Boot that might also work (it's also adjustable) -- have her talk to them about adjusting it as the swelling goes down if that's needed beyond the velcro straps that come with it. If you're unable to elevate your legs comfortably you might try elevating the foot of your bed slightly -- even just a few inches. That way you get the benefit of gravity at night, and that should help make the morning less of a problem. (Offer your DH an extra pillow or two if he feels a bit upside down!) As for self-MLD, it's a great idea to have your DH help, but you and your therapist might also put your heads together and see if you can come up with some sort of reaching devise that would make it possible for you. There are a number or reachers made for assorted disabilities, and there should be some simple way to adjust the technology so it works for you. Maybe, if your therapist is a PT, she needs to consult with an OT on how to make this work for you. LE is nothing if not creative! Keep working on this with her, or consider a second opinion. You're spot-on about your own needs, and I'm sorry you have to stick up for yourself. But I do get the impression you're up for this! Brava! Let us know how we can help. Big hugs, Binney",

      "Content": "Aug 1, 2010 12:04AM - edited Aug 1, 2010 12:08AM by Binney4 Cori, welcome! Glad you found us; sorry you had to. Welcome to your daughter too -- sounds like she'll be a good partner for learning and helping you absorb all the new information and skills.  As for the therapist's plan, it sounds like a good start, though four days is rarely enough to cover all the teaching involved. If the swelling is down in four days, and you've learned self-wrapping, self-massage (it's actually called Manual Lymph Drainage, or MLD), some exercises you can do on-going, and how to care for your skin, then \"graduating\" to self-care and compression garments seems like a reasonable plan. If the swelling is not down, I assume she'll plan another week or two, yes? Also, if you're not sure about your wrapping and self-massage skills after only four days (which is a LOT to cover unless you have some nursing or other medical background), then talk to her about a longer course of treatment. You need to get all your questions asked and answered, and feel confident in all your self-care knowledge, and for me at least that took a lot longer than a week (four weeks, to be exact, followed by a number of frantic emails and phone calls to deal with new worries or unexpected flares). These are life skills, so don't feel rushed. Here's the deal with LANA. It's a certifying organization that requires a therapist to have 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training past their original certification. Then LANA administers a written test and charges a substantial fee, and the therapist can then put \"LANA\" among their string of credentials. Therapists can renew their certification at intervals with no follow-up review of their skills. There is NO test of their hands-on skills, and there is no way for patients to appeal to LANA for help if one of their certified therapists is not following the proper protocols. Many well-trained therapists never take the LANA test or pay the fee because it is not required for insurance authorization and because most of them have a long waiting list of patients anxious to see them, so \"advertising\" with a LANA listing is not helpful to their already-backlogged caseload. The CLT after your therapist's name indicates she has probably had the full 135 hours of training, though, even without the LANA initials. You can always ask her about her training, and she should be happy to tell you where and how long she was trained.  I can't tell from your description what stage your LE is. When you mention skin involvement, that might indicate Stage III LE, but in that case she wouldn't be suggesting a single week of treatment. The short course of treatment would indicate it's Stage I. Cording isn't a skin condition, it's a thrombosed lymph vessel, and though it can precede the development of lymphedema in some cases, it's a separate issue, so not a part of the staging process. Here's a page from the StepUp-SpeakOut site about cording: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm As Kane and Faith indicate, most of us need to wear compression garments daily in order to maintain control. Like you, I found that hard to believe at first. It didn't even make sense to me, like, which is worse, the swelling or the garments?!! But as you start to understand the way the lymph system works -- and what happens as the condition progresses when it isn't controlled -- it all makes sense. As some of our more active ladies tell us, professional athletes have taken to wearing compression sleeves in order to boost their performance. So, it's all part of the \"tools\" we use to stay well. On the other hand, you're right that it IS a gold standard where patient self-management is concerned. Compression garments boost the lymph flow, because they provides the outside pressure that acts with your muscle movements to stimulate the pumping action of the lymph vessels. The lymph system has no \"heart\" to pump the fluid through the vessels, so that stimulation is crucial.  Best thing right now is that you seem to feel comfortable with your therapist. It's a long-term relationship, so it's really important to be confidant with her and able to ask questions comfortably. Also great is that you're starting treatment so early -- that will make a big difference in managing it on-going.  All good, Cori! Please keep us posted. Be well, Binney P.S. - Sorry to be so long-winded -- whew!",

But then I turned them inside out just to see if they're roomier when worn inside-out (they are, but they look a lot stranger). Anyhow, what I discovered is now utterly simple they are to make, both to cut out and stitch. So it occurs to me that once you have a pair you could easily make any number in any color or pattern you'd like. The fabric is a two-way stretch (a 2-inch to 5-inch stretch around the hand and a 2 to 3 stretch lengthwise). A quarter yard would work for the length, and they're each about 7 inches wide. That's gonna be one of my summer projects. Clean hands, with style! Love it! Binney",

Though lymphedema can present as swelling in only a small or restricted area, the rest of your symptoms don't sound a lot like a lymphedema flare. Or maybe not JUST a lymphedema flare. Might you have done some muscle or tendon damage with that hit you kind of remember? (Boy, do I know what you mean by that--I get busy and bang some part of me and the next day when it's black and blue I can vaguely remember hurting it but can't recall how/where. Sigh!) Some pain and some skin sensitivity can also accompany lymphedema, but rarely with the severity you're describing. As for cording, that's conceivable, and the \"cord\" is not always visible or able to be felt. Definitely have this checked out. Any chance you could find a lovelier PCP?

But as you suggested in your first post, the sleeve may not be right for you now that there is swelling, and for sure not without a glove. Once LE is present, the usual procedure is to do the therapy intensive first, then get fitted for a sleeve and glove when the swelling has been reduced. Until you begin your intensive, anything that makes your arm swell or ache or otherwise feel strange is a signal to stop AT ONCE and elevate your arm. (Geesh, is that ever hard to do! You just want to finish what you're doing, you know? Don't risk it!) Some exercise is good, and once you're in good care you'll find your way back to the things you love, but until then it's bound to be a bit frustrating because anything strenuous is going to cause you grief. LE rots that way. Do be sure to read up on the measures to prevent infection, as you'll now need to be extra careful about that.  The good news: with therapy things will get better. Hang in there!

Since you're a passenger, can you keep your arm elevated and supported throughout the trip? I also find that lots of start/stop driving (shopping, crowded freeway driving) is harder on my LE than a smooth trip. Stay really well hydrated, keep up with the deep abdominal breathing and the arm/hand stretches at intervals. And HAVE FUN!! Happy travels! Binney",

If there's any new swelling or the redness or rash spreads or worsens, please high-tail it to the ER and get some help. Did your therapist tell you it was an allergic reaction, and if so, what did she base that on? Did she try using a different lining material (stockinette and/or foam) under the bandages to see if that made a difference? Sorry for all the questions, but it seems strange to me that your therapist didn't take immediate note of this and figure it out conclusively, then correct the problem. If it's an allergic reaction then you need to know what's causing it specifically before you get fitted for garments that might contain the same irritant.

You can also use the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. Just follow the links to the graduate lists of four fully-certified LE therapy schools. (You may find more here who are not listed with LANA. That's because they have to pay to be LANA certified, but the LANA credentials are not required anywhere in the U.S. to practice LE therapy, so not every fully-trained LE therapist is LANA certified, but every LANA therapist is fully-trained. Hope that made sense!) Eventually I hope LANA certification will be legally mandated throughout the U.S. -- sure would make it easier to find a therapist! Do let us know how it goes! Binney ",

Sorry that I don't know which video to recommend, but I'm sure someone with experience on this will be along soon. Just a warning that if you've had a bilateral mastectomy, then neither the massage in the Burt and White book nor any of the videos would be appropriate for you to use, because with bilateral surgery you don't want to move the fluid to the opposite side as they show (which is also at risk and can become overwhelmed). With bilateral it's a whole different direction. If you're bilateral the Burt and White book, pages 73 to 78 in my edition, has good information about massage in general, but when you get to the actual directions (starting on page 78), you only want to do Step 1, clearing the neck nodes. Good news is, that alone will probably help, according to a study at the U of Arizona's LE research unit. If your sleeve is leaving long-lasting impressions on your upper arm or wrist when you take it off, it could be adding to the swelling. Also, pain draws lymph fluid, so any substantial discomfort should be avoided. You don't mention a glove, but if you wear the sleeve do wear a glove with it. All the other prevention and management hints in the Burt and White should help you keep it down. Don't overdo it, stay out of hot water (literally!), and keep your arm elevated as much as possible--on the back of the car seat, or the couch when you watch TV or read, on pillows at night. I hope someone comes along soon to answer your question on videos. (Good idea to take someone with you in November who can film the massage and the wrap procedure as your therapist does it, for later reference...) Sorry you've had to join our \"swell\" group, but glad you found us. (((((Hugs))))))! Binney ",

You have covered all the bases, to be sure, so it comes as no surprise that you've also been communicating with Israel and beyond. Love it!  Here's a thought that I'll just throw out here even though it likely has no relevance. Still, it struck me when I heard it, so I'll pass it on raw to all of you. I attended a round-table discussion with a young surgeon who is just beginning to perform lymph node transplant surgery in the US. I was completely unimpressed with the woman, so I'm not recommending her to anyone (in fact, I think she's dangerous -- careless). BUT, in describing her procedure she said that as preparation for the transplant of groin nodes to the axilla, she removes the scar, radiation and LE fibrosis from the area. When another plastic surgeon asked her how she did that, she said she could see it, and she was able very carefully to scrape it away. I had never heard of that before, but this is microsurgery and it's a fairly new procedure, so perhaps it has something to do with Dr. Rochland's information switch. At the conference there was a huge exhibit hall where LE product venders set up shop, and some items I noted that might (or might not!) be useful to you, so I'll pass along my paltry findings and hope some, at least, will strike a chord with you. First, magnetic sew-on \"buttons.\" These are small magnets with four holes at the edges so they can be sewn in place under a regular botton. They're strong enough to keep our clothes in place even through a big sneeze and they're extremely easy to manage. They're available (and there's a picture) at www.sansu.ca, where they cost $10/Canadian for a set of 6. Which seems mighty steep to me, so I'm ordering one set and hope to be able to determine who makes them and if they can be ordered directly more reasonably. (Let's hope so!) Actually, while you're there do take a look at the purse they make, which has a fabric loop sewn onto the back so you can put your arm into it, sort of like a sling only a whole lot more attractive! If donning sleeves is a problem, High Desert Pharmaceutics makes a liquid called CompressionAssist that you can put on your arm to make it satiny-smooth so the sleeve slides on easily. They discovered this slip-on ease accidentally because the stuff contains something used to treat slow-healing skin wounds in LE patients, and they found it really easy to get the garments on when they were being treated. It's hypo-allergenic, non-greasy, and it's a skin lubricant as well. It doesn't harm garment fabric, either. Maybe worth a try. They're at www.highdesertpharma.com, and since they were giving out neat little samples, I'd try asking them to send you a sample before ordering. JoviPak had a bunch of sample night garments there. They make them all special-order, so there were lots of different ideas on display. One was a night vest (which is like the ones I use for my chest/back/side LE) so I was looking at it closely. It was longer than the one I wear, with a fabric panel (just a single piece of fabric, not quilted like the rest of the vest) that extended well below the waist, so it would keep my tummy warm at night -- nice! No more icy tummy! But it also had a fabric loop attached a little below waist level that was six or seven inches wide. Couldn't figure that one out, so I asked the gal working there. \"Oh, that was a special order,\" she said, \"for a woman with a flaccid arm.\" Of course I asked her if she meant BP,  but she had no idea. So I just pass that along anyway, for whatever it's worth. And finally (and Barbara has probably tried this one too!) there's Kinesio taping. I brought home their advertising DVD for my therapist, but when I watched it yesterday I was surprised to hear that among its many uses was both \"pain relief\" and, more likely,  \"stabilizing subluxed joints.\" So I have an email in to them asking for information about the use of Kinesio tape to stabilize shoulders in BP. I'll let you know what they have to say. If that would turn out to be workable for stabilization, then there's another company that sells the tape already slit and backed with peel-off paper for easy application. That's all I can think of right now. Hope everybody's well, and since I don't know where you all live, I hope no one's in the path of all those hurricanes swirling across the Atlantic at us! Be well, all! Binney",

But you got here automatically apparently, and posted successfully, so no problem with that. Hoping others with RIBP will be better able to find us here. Oddly, I have a friend at that hospital this week for her regular check-up for her son. He was born prematurely and still has some medical issues 6 years later, so she does a semi-annual trek there to monitor his progress. Good hospital, and I'm guardedly hopeful for you -- nah! truth is I'm downright excited! Prayers for good news, or even hints of good news. LOL! I don't have a medical or research background at all, but when I ran into the wall of LE I was simply stunned that it was such an unknown. So for four years I've been turning over every rock trying to find out what's known and what isn't, and who's passionate about it. The RIBP is definitely related to LE in terms of our body's responses, and what we learn about LE on the cellular level will eventually give us information we need about BP, I'm sure of that. At the moment the researchers seem to be stumbling around in the dark on this, as alone and isolated as the BP patients themselves are. As with the LE, I'm hoping that when RIBP patients begin to come together and share their insights and experiences, we can help give direction to the researchers and doctors working in the field and speed up the process of finding workable treatments, prevention, and even cures. Which is why I'm excited about your visit to Cinncinnati. Even if they can't offer you immediate help (though I'm sure hoping they can!), meeting with you and exchanging information will give them valuable clues that they may eventually put together into some new approach. Okay, I'll climb down off the chandelier, where I seem to be swinging this morning. Bet you're sorry you asked about my medical background now! Wow! No kidding on the triple neg?!

Almost had \"cancer of the fingernail\" the other day until I came to my senses and remembered I'd caught my finger in the cupboard door earlier. You're absolutely right about the freedom we can have when we're willing to focus on counting our blessings. Just that is takes some time to get to that point! Thinking of you too, Barbara! Hurry home! Be well! Binney",

But I can just imagine the un-amused response you get when you use it. I was at the mall with one arm wrapped in bandages, the other in compression garments, and a bulky compression vest that works great for the LE but makes me look like a suicide bomber. A feisty elderly man walked up to me and stuck his face in mine and said, \"What happened to you?\" I thought I was very clever when I answered right back with, \"You should see the other guy!\" But then he said, \"I don't see how anybody could look any worse off than you!\" And I decided right there never to use that line again! So the trapeze line works for me too! I really appreciate all your hints for the day-to-day difficulties. It's those small things that seem to be so defeating. I had a beautiful, heavy wool cape that my mother bought for me years ago in Germany that would be perfect for you in the damp cold of the Pacific Northwest. I wonder if it would be possible to find one like it on-line? Silfang, you sound so satisfied with your garments, and that's so cheering! It can take some time to find the garments that work best for you, but it's a relief when you do. Hope it never changes! Barbara, YOU are good company! Hugs all around, Binney",

That's amazing that your rad onc denies the rads had anything to do with your Radiation-Induced BP.  Completely nuts! But then my surgeon STILL says he has never had a patient develop LE after any surgery he did. The fact that I have LE in both arms, my back, chest and side must just be pure cussedness on my part, because HE sure didn't have anything to do with it! You ARE on the LE board, but you're posting on a thread that about BP. The other threads are below this one on the board index here: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64 See if that works. Just scroll down and click on any title that interests you, or start another subject of your own by clicking on the red box near the top that says \"Start new topic.\" Ronimom, I'm sending you a Private Message, and in case you don't know how to find those, do this: Scroll to the top of this page.

I've been talking to my area Flexi rep, and some of the things she says about it made me wonder if it would be a good resource. Among other things, she said that pain relief is one of the best arguments they have for getting insurance approval, because it's gentle enough to help with conditions like fibromyalgia and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Erica, I was thinking about your pain. It's possible to get a free demonstation (on you!) by calling or emailing the company and connecting with your area rep.

I'd asked them in an email if it didn't work for RIBP, why not. And just today I got an explanation, so I'll share it with you: \"...A main limitation in using functional electrical stimulation (FES) to treat this condition stems from the type of paralysis you have.  The radiation essentially caused damage to your peripheral nerves, making them non-responsive to electrical stimulation.  When paralysis is caused by damage to the central nervous system (such as at the spinal cord) without damage to the peripheral nerves (such as the brachial plexus), the peripheral nerves are still intact and respond to stimulation.  This is unfortunately not the case for RIBP....Regarding your question about pain, there is research being conducted at our center looking at blocking nerves that conduct pain.  This research is in very early stages but may someday be an option to reduce the pain experienced by RIBP.\" Erica, if you're still reading here, this made me think of you! Sure hope you're finding the help you need for real pain relief. Thinking of you, keeping you in my prayers, Binney ",

There is a new project underway in the U.S. to develop treatment standards for lymphedema, so that all our medical folks can be on the same page about diagnosis, treatment, therapist training, and reimbursement. The project is called the Americal Lymphedema Framework Program (ALFP), and it just had its first meeting (last Monday in Chicago), inviting professionals, patients, and suppliers to discuss what issues they think should be covered in the new treatment standards. Since RIBP has lymphedema as one of its components, barbaraellen decided it would be a good idea to attend that meeting and bring RIBP to their attention. It was an all-day meeting, and several topics were eventually settled on to be discussed in more detail. Thanks to barbaraellen's efforts, one of those topics was RIBP! Though this was just a preliminary meeting, and we have no idea what the follow-through will be, it was WONDERFUL to make all those people aware of the unique needs and experiences of all those with RIBP-related lymphedema. Below I'll copy the document that barbaraellen's group generated. THANKS, BARBARAELLEN!!! More information about the Framework Project at http://www.alfp.org ALFP STAKEHOLDER'S MEETING Chicago \u2013 March 16, 2009 Working Group Report   Names of people in the Working Group: (barbaraellen and her husband and three professionals) Issue discussed: TREATMENT AND RADIATION WITH RESULTANT LYMPHEDEMA AND BRACHIAL PLEXOPATHY   Related issues that have been identified: 1. Access to treatments. 2. Early diagnosis. 3. \u201cCutting edge\u201d treatment. 4. Long-term consequences of treatment. 5. Qualified therapists   Possible solutions that have been identified: 1. Early patient education 2. Qualified medical personnel to allow patient early diagnosis. 3. Comprehensive standards of care.  4. Research for upcoming interventions.   5. Research on exercise to prevent long-term consequences   Resources needed to implement the Solutions: \u2022 Basic CME courses for edema/lymphedema open to medical personnel to facilitate faster referrals for patient to lymphedema diagnosticians and practitioners \u2022 Funding and research personnel \u2013develop research foundations \u2022 Scholarships for lymph certification courses (possible donations from industry)   Recommendations to American Lymphedema Framework Project: \u2022 Improve awareness of ALFP by LANA (Lymphology Association of North America), NLN (National Lymphedema Network \u2022 Have the stakeholders meeting be a committee on the organization tree \u2022 Explore avenues for scholarships and funding by targeting industries that have received profit from the disease   Actions group members are willing to make:  \u2022 Provide continuing education to non-lymphedema staff (i.e. OT/PT/RN) via staff in services  \u2022 Continue involvement with ALFP  ",

I so hope you all had a peaceful and painfree Thanksgiving. Cellulitis is painful and so in shingles, so that added to the RIBP pain is beyond comprehension. Hopefully the antibiotics have already brought down the pain level from cellulitis, and the lymphedema will soon be back in control. Anita, I agree with you on that \"some are worse off\" argument. Never has done a thing for me, except perhaps to make me feel even more miserable. I think it's often said because people don't know what else to say, but it's no kindness to minimize anyone's suffering with that kind of statement. Have you talked to any of your doctors about a low dose antibiotic while you're actively doing acupuncture, so as to lower the infection risk. Also, acupuncture is something that can affect your involved shoulder and arm even when the needles are placed elsewhere in your body. Do talk to the acupuncturist about using other sites instead.

I sure hope others will be along with their experience and suggestions. We need each other. The only thing I can think of is the shower, which is much safer with a shower chair. They come with or without a supportive back, and they have strategic holes in them so soapy water can flow off you easily. Soap-on-a-rope or in a terry-cloth pouch might be easier to hang onto? How about a bar of soap in a terry-cloth pouch with a wrist strap to keep it handy? Holler if you want one and I'll try designing one for you. Maybe a soft terry wrist strap with elastic in it so it's easy to slip on and off but not so easy that it falls off. As for getting out of the tub, I suspect some leg-strengthening and balance exercises might help. The Lebed exercise DVD has an excellent balance section, but I have no idea about what  leg exersices might help. Maybe a PT would be useful for that? Have to admit I grinned at the image of asking for permission to take your husband with you into the fitting rooms. I can only imagine how rattled that must make the fitting-room supervisors. Our daughter has a service dog, and when we shop we march into fitting rooms with the dog, who then lies down and watches out from under the door with all the tail-wagging, tongue-lolling doggie glee she can muster. Kind of unsettles the other shoppers, for sure. Usually when we emerge there's a small audience standing in front of the door, some with smiles, some with scowls. Too funny! Like you, Barbaraellen, I wish there was worlds more helpful information about RIBP -- like how to fix it, for instance. Gentle hugs, Binney",

I have to say, though, that using therabands makes my hands swell just about as soon as I touch them.  There's no way to regulate how much weight you're pulling with therabands, so it's easy to pull way too much without the proper build-up or conditioning. Especially if you're using them to rehab some other part of your body. A couple of years ago I broke my leg, and after the cast came off the PT wanted me to hold a theraband in both hands and pull with my leg. NOT!!

That would be the problem with any study of RIBP, though, because it does often develop really slowly over time. The issue is, are there women who are being treated TODAY who will eventually develop it, and I think there are, though it's rare. Still, just as with LE, the more improvements they make in BC survival rates and the longer we live, the more of these long-term side effects we'll see.

Yes, doctors advertise such things, and I agree with you that that's unfortunate, to say the least. But patient to patient it's amazing to be able to hear a real-life story in progress. Here's a small study from 2009 regarding nerve transfer surgery, done at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Clearly more research is needed to follow up on these surgeries, and I hope Dr. Wolfe and others doing the surgeries will be providing that for us as they proceed. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_B... If you scroll down from that study you'll see other studies regarding another surgical procedure proposed for RIBP, but this is the first report I've ever heard from a patient perspective about any RIBP surgeries.

The CMS (the board that regulates Medicare benefits) has clarified that IMPROVEMENT is NOT a valid criteria for continuing therapy. Many here have had their therapy ended because improvement could not be shown in the case of RIBP, but it is now established that therapy needed for MAINTENANCE of current condition or to PREVENT OR SLOW DETERIORATION will be covered. The new guidelines, called the Jimmo Settlement, can be seen here: https://www.cms.gov/Center/Special-Topic/Jimmo-Cen... Lower down on that page you'll also find Frequently Asked Questions. Here's an important one, but check them all out: Q7: Can a patient change from an improvement course of care to a maintenance course of care, and vice versa? A7: Yes. The therapy plan of care should indicate the treatment goals based on an individualized assessment or evaluation of the patient. Skilled services would be covered where such skilled services are necessary to maintain the patient's current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration so long as the beneficiary requires skilled care for the services to be safely and effectively provided. The health care provider must continually evaluate the individual's need for skilled care, as well as whether such care meets Medicare's overall requirement for being reasonable and necessary to diagnose or treat the individual's condition, and make such determinations on an ongoing basis, altering \u2013 on a prospective and not a retrospective basis \u2013 the treatment plan and goals when necessary. This new ruling can make lymphedema control and on-going occupational therapy help possible, and I'm hoping this will brighten the outlook for many dealing with the challenges of RIBP. Hugs, Binney",

Brachial plexopathy means the radiation has damaged the brachial nerve, which can result in gradual paralysis of the arm. It's a very rare condition and fortunately not at all what you're describing. What you're describing is lymphedema, which is a result of trauma to the lymph system, either by the surgery itself or the radiation that sometimes follows. Once the lymph system is compromised by the surgery and/or radiation, then it can be triggered by an injury like your fall, or even a more minor event (like an insect bite or hang nail), or anything that might overload the lymph system. Your new lymphedema may not be related to your radiation at all, since you also had surgery that affects the lymph system. The most important thing is to get good help quickly, as lymphedema is easier to get into control and to manage over time if you catch it early. Any member of your healthcare team can write a referral for you to see a well-qualified lymphedema therapist. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified...

Sure hope so, but I know you can read even if you can't post, so I'll post this information here, and please feel free to email me too.) Before I left last week for the LE conference in San Diego I had found a study done by Dr. Shimon Rochkind in Israel regarding laser treatment of BP. The title is listed in the email exchange below, so you can google it, or if you can't find it I'll be happy to go locate it and post it here (it'll have to be later, though -- I'm in the middle of an enormous pile of laundry from the trip!) Anyhow, with Barbara in mind because she's told us (however jokingly I don't know) that she'd go anywhere in the world to get help for her BP, I emailed Dr. Rochkind this note: \"Dear Dr. Rochkind,  I have been looking for answers for a friend who has been suffering from radiation-induced brachial plexopathy for several years. I found your article, Laser Phototherapy (780 nm), a New Modality in Treatment of Long-Term Incomplete Peripheral Nerve Injury: A Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study, and I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for ways my friend might be successfully treated for her condition. She is willing to go anywhere for help.  Thank you for the work you do.\" Just today he sent me this email reply: \"Thank for referring to me with the case of your friend.  According to provided data, your friend suffers from post radiated brachial plexus injury. The result of neurological damage in these cases is slow growth of scar tissue resulting from radiation. The treatment of patient who has slow progressive neurological deficits and pain is microsurgical release and neurolysis of the brachial plexus. From my personal experience with similar cases the results of the treatment in most cases is successful.   In these specific cases I recommend microsurgery and not laser treatment.  If your friend wishes to be treated in Israel he should contact me directly.   With best regards,   Dr. Shimon Rochkind Specialist in Neurosurgery & Microsurgery Director, Division of Peripheral Nerve Reconstruction Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center Tel Aviv University, Israel Member, Peripheral Nerve Committee, WFNS Senior Editor, Photomedicine & Laser Surgery\" If any of you would like to communicate directly with him, please let me know and I'll send you his email address. He may have more research he can share with you, and other information that would help us understand what the surgery involves, how proven it is, and whether or not there's anyone here in the States who might be doing it as well. I certainly can't offer any personal recommendation because this is well out of my knowledge area, but if anyone's seriously interested I'll try and ask around among the LE docs I know and see what they can tell me about this. Dr. Shimon's name was recommended to me by Dr. Neil Piller in Australia, who is a well-respected doctor and researcher into laser use, but clearly Dr. Shimon sees other options in this situation, and they may be worth exploring. The information I could gather at the LE conference was not encouraging -- radiation-induced BP is obviously baffling to them. There were a couple of products I thought might be helpful for management, but not for real help, and I'll post about them as soon as I can catch up on the laundry! I still have some email questions out to one of the presenters at the conference that I didn't manage to button-hole in person, and I'll let you know what she has to say when I hear from her. If anyone looks into Dr. Shimon's proposal or knows more about it, please do post and let us know. Whew! Glad to be back. Hugs all around! Binney ",

Once there's swelling it's a lot harder to fix and control than if you just take the steps you can to prevent it. If you can get anyone on your med team to give you a referral to a well-qualifed lymphedema therapist, that'd be a big help in getting baseline arm measurements, risk reduction tips, instruction in gentle self-massage you can use prophylactically, and advice about your own individual risks. And also a fitting for a compression sleeve and glove (or gauntlet). They'll need to fit really well, which is why \"generic\" self-fitting doesn't work well, especially the first time out. Once you have them and the fit is checked for correctness, you can use them for exercise or strenuous activity, travel, or any time your arm feels heavy or achy. Splints will not work for this, though you can wear them for other conditions over a well-fitted compression garment as long as they don't bind or provide a tourniquet effect. Here are two web sites for finding well-trained therapists near you: www.mylymphedema.com   Click on the therapist locator and follow all the links. www.clt-lana.org   For position papers from the National Lymphedema Network that you can share with your reluctant doctor, see the ones on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise here: www.lymphnet.org Shouldn't have to do our own homework on all this, should we?

First, the \"bra-angel,\" which holds one end of your bra for you so you can hook the other end into it. It's not entirely clear how this works in practice, though the pictures are intriguing, so I'm putting the link here and look forward to hearing from someone as to whether this looks useful or not. It's here: http://www.sammonspreston.com/app.aspx?cmd=get_subsections&id=100826 (Okay, I give up -- this link won't work right, so when you get to the page click on \"Aids to Daily Living\" on the left-hand side of the page and that should give you a page with the Bra-Angel at the top. Click on it and it'll give you a full description and pictures of how it works.) And then -- ta-da!! There's a new workbook out for adults to learn how to write with your non-dominant hand. It was written by two OT/hand therapists and it's called Handwriting for Heroes: Learn to Write with Your Non-Dominant Hand in Six Weeks. I ordered one and I really like the way it's set up, the exercises, the hints all through, the adult slant, and the genuine encouragement.  I'm going to do it, as I can't write much with my right hand or it swells, so nobody got Christmas cards this year and I can't write real snail-mail notes to people either. Next Christmas will be different!   Anyhow, I wrote up a brief review and Jane put it on our website with links so you can find their website and order one if you'd like. It's here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm#WRITTEN_COMMUNICATION:_0 Remember Alicen's mention of the Cleveland FES Clinic that she and I both emailed, and it turned out not to be workable for RIBP? It was one of the therapists there who emailed me with information about this workbook, as she said she'd be keeping an eye out for anything that would be a help to us. Nice! Thanks, Ceveland FES Clinic! Hugs all around, Binney",

I'll keep you all posted on progress with this, and I'm hopeful you'll all participate when we finally get to the active interview stage.

The loss of the hand-work is so difficult. I don't have RIBP, but my bilateral LE is much worse in my right (dominant) hand, so I too had to give up crocheting -- used to have it with me everywhere I went, always working on something. I've taken up loom-knitting, which I can do with my left hand, but it was very frustrating learning to do it that way. I did order a small book from Amazon called \"How to Conquer Hobbies with One Hand: 50 Tips and Tools to Make Things\" by Paul Berger, but unfortunately his main hobby is making model railroads. But it was inspiring, at least. We need to write a book like that for us needle-crafters! I wonder if there are OTs who could help us figure out how to use a sewing machine one-handed? Cutting is still a problem, of course, but I weight the fabric down with books and use a rotary cutter. The hardest part for me is working up the motivation to do these things when it's so much more effort than it used to be... I do have some happy news to report on the handwriting front (well, this week I'm happy about it, but I could be frustrated again tomorrow): I'm practicing with the \"Handwriting for Heroes\" workbook and actually starting to feel good about my growing skill with it. Still looks like elementary school writing but, hey, it's more readable than any of my doctors'! And I'm getting faster all the time. Barbara, I hear you on forgetting what I was writing by the time I can get it written, but I'm hoping I'll continue to improve. It has given me empathy bordering on reverence for the struggle of young children to master handwriting -- who knew?! Watts, have you visited the RIBP information page? It's here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm Barbara, is your family resettled yet?

Some news about SHOULDER SUBLUXATION (which, in plain English means the partial dislocation of the shoulder joint that can happen with progressing RIBP). Hope it's helpful to some. Some time ago I heard that kinesio taping, which is sometimes used to help drain areas of lymphedema, is also used to support joints, and in particular the shoulder. So I've been casting around trying to get information about this and yesterday received an email from one of the foremost experts on kinesio taping. I had asked her if kinesio taping could be used for this situation; here's her reply: \"You are correct in thinking and seeing that Elastic support and Taping could assist with this condition. I have used it with Brachial plexus injuries many times and subluxed shoulders for stabilization of the anterior capsule. In the past had a patient with radiation injury post radical neck tx and it did help with relief of the \"burning parasthesias\" that radiated to the hand. The only concern is the strength/health of the skin of the individual where the tape will be placed.  Each case would also need to be assessed for implementation.  Provide anterior capsule stabilization?  Supporting the weight of the arm?  Relax the antagonist (Latissimus Dorsi)?  Many ways it can be used and in addition the edema in the area will be reduced.\"   Since it's so often difficult (impossible?!) to find therapists who will or can help with this issue, hopefully it will help to at least have this much information to pass along to doctors and therapists.

RIF has been shown to respond to trental and Vitamin E, especially when treated early. But RIBP, unfortunately, doesn't. Here's a section with recent trental/E studies: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm#drugs%20tren It's so hard, but so important, to get a firm diagnosis. I just wish there was enough awareness within the medical community to make it possible to get early and accurate diagnoses for all these radiation-induced complications. Without that basic awareness it's not even possible to get anyone's attention on prevention, treatment, or cure -- and that's what we need! An update from Elise Radina who is doing the interview study on RIBP -- because some people who signed up for the study didn't even have RIBP, they're redesigning the announcement to eliminate people who stumble into it without even understanding what RIBP is, much less being diagnosed with it. So they'll pick up again with the study, probably as soon as August. Onward! Binney",

Thanks for sharing them! Here it is - the first installment of my MSKCC Rehab and Dr. Stubblefield evaluation. Sunday, Aug 14th - Arrive in NYC! Good smooth flight, quick taxi ride to the hotel... raining and 70's - much different than the TX heat we left behind! Monday, Aug 15th - Started with MSKCC Financial Center - to obtain my insurance info and explain benefits - from there I headed to Dr. Michael Stubblefield's office for my initial evaluation/consult. It began with a staff physician and medical student asking many questions regarding my past medical activity, specifically the Hodgkins Disease and related radiation/chemo treatments in the 80's, followed by the additional Breast Cancer radiation/chemo received in 2006. What was refreshing, and encouraging, about this initial discussion was that they understood the damage I have, the related nerve pain, muscle loss, and addition of heart complications. I didn't get the usual \u2018deer in the headlights look, and shrug of the shoulders, of I don't know what to do', response. They then examined me and tested strength tested my fingers, hands, wrists, forearms, biceps, shoulders, neck, legs, and feet. After which, they discussed with Dr Stubblefield. He then came in, introduced himself, and said I believe we need to move to a larger room. OK - wasn't sure why at that moment, but OK just the same. As we walk into the larger examination room, he asks if I mind if his physician and intern staff join us so he can share our discussion and his examination for teaching/learning purposes. I welcome that - the more the merrier! The medical world desperately needs to learn about this virtually unknown, survivor quality of life, problem. So, in came 5 additional Drs. He then asked me questions about pain, numbness, paresthsia and performed some basic strength tests. He physically examined me, discussing out loud his findings for the benefit of the room - and he showed us all MRI graphics of patients with radiation induced brachial plexus involvement, along with photos of neck, back and spine distortions from the radiation nerve damage and related muscle atrophy. He indicated that my severity of nerve damage is mostly from the Hodgkins Disease mantle radiation from the early 80's - the Breast Cancer overlapping radiation of course added to the progression. I am apparently in a 1% population of overall patients he has seen. Interesting indeed. It doesn't make me feel better, or worse, necessarily, as I believe I am in the right hands for diagnosis/help now. The loss of right hand/arm functionality, from nerve damage, is not repairable. The neck, shoulders, and left arm nerve damage, muscle weakness, and overall pain, is attributed to the radiation, and is also not repairable. The numbness, paresthesia, pain in my lower legs, feet and toes, would not be related to the mantle radiation. He has scheduled an EMG for Wednesday, that will be performed in the office. I also have been scheduled for two MRIs next week in the MSKCC hospital locations - one for the brachial plexus, the other for the entire spine. These will rule out any other potential issues, like a tumors - benign or malignant - other nerve disorders, spine problems. Also, they will measure the level of damage done, allowing a full diagnosis and prognosis, followed by a plan of action. Dr Stubblefield is an incredibly personable and knowledgeable MD. He specializes in helping the survivor, surviving the treatments that saved their lives. Bringing back, some of the quality of life those of us have been missing for years. He works closely with the Physical and Occupational Therapy center and directs them to treat the individual needs of each patient. He will also share the plan for PT/OT with my Doctor back in Texas to continue once I return. After my meeting with Dr Stubblefield, I headed to my first Physical Therapy session. There, I received a very detailed examination, and analysis of my physical condition. Measurements and notations made. During the entire time, they explained clearly what they were seeing, doing and documenting, along with why. This allows them to focus on the areas of weakness, which will in turn allow strengthening in core areas. Most of yesterday's time was spent on analysis and planning. Although I did get some homework! Diaphragm breathing while lying down - and learning how to keep the side-stitches under control. ;) I'm already using muscles that have not been used in years. Also, a big change for me - will be practicing, and eventually mastering, sleeping on my back. Very big change - I have been a stomach sleeper for most of my life... and if not on my stomach, I am on my right side... two positions that in the long run do me no good. So, sleep positioning with correct pillow placement is in my future. Apparently, it's not normal to toss and turn all night long... who knew?? Correct positioning equals more restful sleep... :) My first Occupational Therapy is later this afternoon... I'll write more tomorrow, after my EMG and PT/OT sessions.",

Carol57 posted this to another thread, and I'm eager to share it with all of you: Bob Weiss, the wonderful LE advocate who helps with insurance denials of LE and garment coverage, just posted on another forum, giving the link to a news story: www.nytimes.com/2012/10/23/us/... Here's the first part of the story: Tens of thousands of people with chronic conditions and disabilities may find it easier to qualify for Medicare coverage of potentially costly home health care, skilled nursing home stays and outpatient therapy under policy changes planned by the Obama administration. In a proposed settlement of a nationwide class-action lawsuit, the administration has agreed to scrap a decades-old practice that required many beneficiaries to show a likelihood of medical or functional improvement before Medicare would pay for skilled nursing and therapy services. Under the agreement, which amounts to a significant change in Medicare coverage rules, Medicare will pay for such services if they are needed to \u201cmaintain the patient\u2019s current condition or prevent or slow further deterioration,\u201d regardless of whether the patient\u2019s condition is expected to improve. Federal officials agreed to rewrite the Medicare manual to make clear that Medicare coverage of nursing and therapy services \u201cdoes not turn on the presence or absence of an individual\u2019s potential for improvement,\u201d but is based on the beneficiary\u2019s need for skilled care. Yes! Continuing care becomes a possibility again! Be well, Binney",

While you're in therapy the arm/hand compression comes from the wrapping -- short-stretch bandages in the Michelin style. When the swelling is as reduced as it can be for the time being, you get measured for a sleeve and glove that you can wear during the day. At night you wrap again, or you buy a night compression sleeve (Solaris, JoviPak, Telesto Medtech). Breast LE is a bit different because (aside from that arrangement of oranges and old tennis shoe soles you just escaped from) you don't use bandages on your chest. You use massage and compression. The Bellisse bra is not the weapon of choice for everyone, but essentially it's the only one out there made for this purpose (except for custom-made vests by folks like Jobst or Bio-Concepts, but my experience is that these are only for people who have agreed to give up breathing for the duration). So we do a certain amount of fairly expensive experimenting around until we settle on something that works for compression for the specific areas that are driving us nuts. Jane and bygrace are both avid experimenters who have (thankfully!!!) shared their sensational finds with us. (As in Jane's long thread about the Jobst post-surgical bra that she was not pleased with. Yes! Great resource -- thank you again, Jane!) As for the bandages smashing our fragile little lymphatics, well, that can actually happen if it's too tight, but then you'd probably have other symptoms, like tingling blue fingers, that would alert you to the problem. The idea, though, is to create a graduated compression from the hand up to the pit, well enough padded and evenly applied so that it doesn't unduly press in any one place and cause fluid back-up. Our day garments (for arms) do the same thing, graduated pressure and all. If you wear the top folded down, allow a bunch-up of wrinkles to form, or disturb the smooth flow of compression any other way, then you can cause back-up. If you wear the day garments (which are designed strictly to move fluid in combination with your muscle moverments and don't work if you're lying still for hours at a time) when you go to bed at night, you run the risk of the garments causing constriction and fluid stoppage. So you only want to wrap with bandages or wear a foam-chip-filled night garment to bed. (No, let me change that -- nobody WANTS to wear this to bed. What I mean is you HAVE to, not that you want to.) Again, breast LE is different. I wear a Solaris night vest for mine, but again, experimenting will get you what you need. A night vest is actually reasonably comfortable and the compression feels a lot less binding, so deep breathing is still on the agenda and you don't wake up gasping for air. So for night wear the products for breast/chest LE are a whole lot better than daytime. Maybe you could work nights?! I'm not sure, BTW, that too much pressure during the massage will \"damage the lymph nodes.\" What it does do is squish the individual lymph vessels -- temporarily, but you sure don't want to do that even temporarily if you're trying to get fluid to flow through them. The compression garments don't do that because they're graduated and cover the entire area. Geesh! Does any of that even make sense?! Hope so, Binney",

I've written to a number of garment makers, but they're pretty much clueless (some are surprised nobody's asked them that before). So, ladies, we're on our own (why are we not surprised?!) Here's what I've discovered so far: 1.) Wearing plastic gloves over my compression gloves makes my hands sweat instantly and soaks my compression gloves in a matter of minutes -- miserably uncomfortable, and not especially helpful from the standpoint of fungal infections either. 2.) Alcohol applications like Purell will ruin the fabric of our compression garments. 3.) Dry cleansers like dry shampoo give your hair a lift by cutting down on the grease, but they don't actually clean anything. 4.) Dry antiseptics have nasty things in them like boric acid that you wouldn't want on your hands. 5.) I can take my gloves off and wash my hands a lot when I'm doing anything messy or unhygienic (even though with compression garments that's not very easy), but that doesn't prevent them from collecting germs and crud from doorknobs or other innocent-looking surfaces. 6.) I can (and do) just wash my gloves throughout the day while they're still on my hands, using hot water and Ivory or Dove hand soap. I dry them on a thick towel just like I would my hands alone, but of course they're still damp. I can't handle books or papers until they dry (here in the desert that only take 15 or 20 minutes). But if it's cold (think, air conditioning) that doesn't work, because my hands freeze. And if I lived somewhere humid it wouldn't be a good idea to leave my hands damp for long enough for it to dry out. Here are a few tips from a friend who consulted her doctor: Avoid breathing in with your mouth open in a crowd (what about talking?!) If you're only able to wash your fingertips, use hand sanitizer on them frequently (but avoid the fabric). Avoid touching your face (eyes, nose, mouth especially) with your hands. And here's a tip from one of the garment makers (Gottfried, to be exact): For goodness sake wash the things every day! So, gals, what ideas can you add that will help us comply with the spirit of the WHO pronouncements? Thanks!

The ST MC5A device synthesizes 16 different waveforms that resemble action potentials, delivered to the surface receptors of the c-fibers, to send \"non-pain\" information along the damaged pathways to reduce central sensitization. All three had marked (over 75%) and sustained (months) reduction of allodynia, hyperalgesia, and pain. All reported marked improvements in their quality of life and normal function. One woman was able to stop chronic opioid use. No side effects were observed. Scrambler therapy is a promising way to relieve cancer and other types of neuropathic pain, and may be helpful in cPMP. Further prospective trials are warranted. PMID: 28775918 [PubMed]  I would LOVE to see this tested with RIBP pain, so will be watching for further news on this technique. I bit of treatment hope would be wildly welcome here! Hugs, Binney",

It used to be insurance wouldn't cover treatment when healing/progress could not be seen, but now therapy can continue for the purpose of maintaining mobility and function without having to prove improvement. RIBP is kinda lonely, as it's fairly rare, so having on-going professional help and support can be a god-send. Also, do you have any kind of support for your arm that might help with the dislocation and instability? If you're using a night sleeve for lymphedema, the companies that make them can add a sling attached to a chest garment that will support your arm at night and make changing position easier and safer. A dependent arm and hand is a real target for lymphedema, so seeing a well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist regularly can head off problems. I so hear you on being so young to face off with RIBP. It's so hard to need help, and even harder to ask for it. Wishing you courage for that, and joy in the kindnesses that come your way in the process. Gentle hugs, Binney",

You sure don't want a lot of craziness from false positives on an MRI, but the \"not knowing\" is enough to drive anyone nuts. If it were me, I'd be with you in wanting things checked out thoroughly, but different people have different tolerance levels for living with uncertainty, so it really does have to be your decision. It's fairly common for doctors to rule out blood clots or new tumor formation when there's new swelling or pain in an arm with LE. Because lymphedema involves fluid that is scattered all around in the interstitial spaces between cells, it's not something you can see with the usual imaging techniques (you can see a seroma with an ultrasound, because it's a \"pool\" of fluid, but you can't see what's in between the cells), so nothing you're proposing would give you a definite LE diagnosis -- it would just rule out other things. I did not have a lumpectomy, I had a mastectomy without recon, so my chest is obviously different to deal with than yours, but my therapist taught me a massage of the deeper nodes in the chest with a small circular movement with the tip of a single finger between the ribs. It's very helpful to me in easing the painful LE flares I get in my chest. I have no idea how much you could do of that with a breast still there, but I'd think some stimulation of the deeper nodes should still be possible wherever you can feel your ribs. Has your therapist been doing that sort of thing? Sorry I can't be more help! Do please let us know what you decide to do and what you discover. Gentle hugs, Binney",

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2009 08:48PM - edited Jun 9, 2009 08:49PM by Binney4 Hi, 4ward, If you don't already have a well-trained lymphedema therapist, that's definitely where you'll want to start. In fact, if you haven't been treated by a lymphedema therapist, do see if you can stop the garment order before delivery and wait until you get an evaluation by a therapist. The reason is, if there's already swelling there, then fitting a garment for the swelling is not going to reduce it. The only way to reduce it is with therapy, and that needs to be done BEFORE fitting so that the (yes, very expensive!) garments you receive can really help you control the swelling. In case that was confusing, I'll try again. Sorry!  What I'm trying to say is, there are two things that need to be done for lymphedema. The first is to reduce the swelling. The second is to keep it reduced. The garments can only do the second, not the first. You need to start by reducing it, then the garments will help keep it that way. In suggesting a therapist I'm assuming your referring doctor has done the testing to determine this new swelling is not the result of other factors, such as a new blood clot, yes? Important to rule out other possibilities before treating for lymphedema. As Kira says, how much each of us needs to wear our garments is a very individual thing, both because our bodies all react differently and because we all make our own compromises with how much we're willing to do to take optimal care of ourselves. It's worth the effort to me to take very good care of my lymphedema, because uncared for it progresses by doing permanent damage inside my arm, and it also increases my risk of serious infection. But how much has to be done to keep swelling down will be different for each of us. Most likely, though, if your job is an active one, your garments will be especially important there.   Lymphedema isn't ALL bad news, though, and a good therapist will go a long way toward making it all as simple and effective as possible. And we're here too, to cheer you on! Sending very gentle ((((hugs!)))) your way, Binney",

The infiltration can take awhile to resolve. Keep it elevated and don't strain it, and unless your surgeon tells you otherwise, do stay well-hydrated. Sometimes docs suggest hot compresses, but if so, use only WARM, not HOT. Hopefully it will slowly but steadily resolve without further problems, but if it doesn't do request a prompt evaluation by a well-qualified lymphedema therapist.

I also think we all have every right to make whatever compromises we think best with this whole BC journey, and with LE in particular. But what I REALLY find unfair is that few of us are told what the LE options are, so our choices can't be made from the strength of good information. So let me spell out what a Therapy Intensive is, and then you'll have the information you need to make your own choices about it. That's empowering, and I hope it will give you more of a sense that your life is back in your own control again. The problem with LE is that it's not just a big arm. If that were all, we'd all try to ignore it and get on with life. But in fact, LE is staged, just like BC, and untreated it just goes on progressing through the stages until eventually it can't be reversed. When I say it progresses, I don't mean it just keeps on getting bigger. Usually that's not the case at all. It swells to a certain point and stops. But it's what goes on INSIDE that's the problem. (Nobody told you this, right? Makes me crazy!) Here's what goes on inside: the fluid stagnates in the area, which compromises your immune system (because the lymph system is part of the immune system), which exposes that entire arm, chest, and back to the possibility of infection. The risk is made even worse because the lymph fluid is warm and protein-rich, which is just what bacteria need to grow exponentially. So any cut, nick, scratch, burn, hangnail or insect bite can easily result in a systemic infection (because it travels throght the lymph system). Which means a stay of a few days or a week in the hospital on IV antibiotics, further damage to the lymph system, and more damage inside. The inside damage that's caused by LE is fibrosis, hardening of the tissues. In the early stages the fibrosis can be softened by the therapist and then gentle LE massage can move the stagnant fluid out of the tissues. But in later stages the fibrosis becomes permanent. It further blocks and damages the lymph system, and in the arm or chest it eventually results in loss of both strength and range of motion. The skin begins to break down, to form pustules of lymph fluid and/or to leak caustic lymph fluid through the pores. And since the lymph fluid is caustic, this causes further skin break-down and sores that are difficult to heal. If all this happened quickly we'd be a lot more aware of it. But usually these effects take several years to reach the most advanced stages. In the past, when few of us lived that long after a BC diagnosis, later-stage LE wasn't much of a problem. But you and I are hoping to go on into ripe old age, so the long-term complications of LE have become a sobering concern. All that just to explain what the Therapy Intensive is about. You fnd a well-trained LE therapist, and she (or he) sets you up for some daily visits that involve massaging the whole area to both move the lymph fluid out and encourage the lymph system to make new connections for fluid flow. Then she wraps the arm in layered bandages with gradient compression (more pressure at the hand, less as it goes up the arm, so it pushes the fluid out.) Meanwhile, you're learning about LE and how to do the massage and wrapping yourself, so you'll always have these treatment tools in your own hands. You do this for a couple of weeks (or in my case for 5 weeks) until the arm and chest and back are all down to as-close-to-normal-size as they can get (for me it was completely back to normal, and it still is). And then you're fitted for compression garments that you wear to keep the swelling down. With this good start and your own self-care you can then hope to avoid serious infection, keep your arm at a normal size, avoid internal damage and fibrosis, and get on with your life. In your case, you might also find that the CTS goes back into its 20-year remission and that the pain disappears. Or you might find that you still need the surgery, but your self-care will prevent the surgery side effects of infection and spread of swelling into your hands. No secret here! You can tell that to my way of thinking this is a win-win situation. But please let me stress again that this is NOT about my way of thinking -- it's ALL about YOURS. I'm not trying to convince you to do something you see no need for, but only to give you the information you need to make this decision your own way. I just hate it that nobody tells us these things. Chattie, if we can help, we're here. I'm rooting for you to get relief - and soon!- for the pain and frustration you're going through. Enough's enough! Binney    ",

Sorry I don't have any answers about nerve impingement, so hopefully others will be along shortly. The symptoms you mention may relate to nerve issues, but they could also relate to increased fluid in the tissues (which can be present before any swelling becomes visible). Anything that causes you pain will draw lymph fluid to the site, potentially overloading the compromised lymph system. It's there to carry away any invading organisms and deal with damaged cellular matter, but when too much accumulates for the lymph system to deal with, swelling increases. If you've gained or lost weight since last using your garments, check out the fit before using them again.

As you wrap with the short stretch bandages across that area, are you folding the bandage down at that point so it isn't pressing into the joint? I can't leave the bandage flat (unfolded) there or I get that in the web. It's a bit of a trick to fold the bandage there and make sure the fold doesn't continue past that point, but with a bit of patience () I can make it work.

Also, for some reason it's hard to keep the short-stretch from rubbing directly on my skin through there, so that's another reason why the extra bit of Artiflex helps there.

My day gloves also cause this kind of pain, and what worked for me is to have my fitter measure around my palm VERY LOOSELY. That keep my thumb from having to work so hard to stay in a relaxed position -- a tight fit around the palm pulls in at the sides and makes my thumb sort of \"collapse\" into my palm in an unnatural position. If you have a lot of swelling in your palm or the back of your hard you could then use a Swell Spot to help with that instead of trying to get all the compression from a too-tight glove. Did any of that make sense?!! Hugs! Keep us posted, Binney",

Especially if your arm is not visibly swollen, they assume you don't have a problem. In other words, if you leave it off they're more likely to follow the instructions. Because I'm bilateral I wear a necklace instead of a bracelet. It says, \"Either arm: No needles, no BP.\"  Tamlyn, UE stands for \"Upper Extremity\" in medical-speak.

Another good phrase to know, in case you have to write it in permanent marker on your arm before surgery or a test involving IVs, is \"Restricted Extremity,\" which can be roughly translated as \"Touch this arm and you die!\" Medical personnel are familiar with \"restricted extremity\" because even though they don't know diddly about lymphedema, dialysis patients also have restricted extremities. Maybe we need one of those foreign language phrase books for visits to the doctor. Be well, Binney",

A lot of the good US researchers are doctoral-level nurses, and LOTS of good research is being done in other parts of the world, where lymphedema is much better known and treated. (Germany, for instance, treats LE in special in-patient hospitals where intensive therapy and patient education can take place around the clock). LE treatment was brought to this country by European nurses such as Saskia Thiadens, the founder of the National Lymphedema Network, only in fairly recent times. For me, the most promising research into individual risk is being done by Stanton in the UK, who has used imaging techniques to determine that women who develop LE after bc treatment have a lymph system that's already functioning at top capacity before the insults of surgery and rads. Women who don't develop it have lymph systems with greater capacity. So at some point, if this proves to be true in larger studies, it may be possible to do some pre-surgical testing that will help us know our risk better.  There are also studies that have found other risk factors to consider: previous trauma or surgeries to the chest; overweight (especially weight gained after surgery); diabetes or other vascular conditions; certain post-surgical conditions (seroma, infection, cording). Other areas still under investigation are inflammatory response and genetic factors. So, lots of new research, just no way to put it all together yet. Hopefully soon! All of this is recent, and it's been difficult for researchers in the field of lymphology to get published in the mainstream American medical journals (since the people who oversee the journals have the same educational deficits Dr. Rockson found). That's why the exercise study that Kmmd and Kira mentioned above in the New England Journal of Medicine was such a break-through for the whole field of lymphedema. That is also why the doctors who read it (not to mention the media's medical reporters) all got it soooooo wrong. They don't know squat. Ah, well, ONWARD! The women who went before us certainly managed to put breast cancer on the awareness map, and those of us concerned about making this part of BC less of a secret need to band together and do the same. Together we can make a difference! Hug all around! Binney P.S - do you realize that if you have read this entire thread you have already spent more time learning about lymphedema than our doctors spend in their entire medical school training?!!",

      "Content": "Binney4 wrote: Hi, all, Some of our LE newbies are having a hard time finding a therapist they can work with, so how about if those of us who have settled on really good ones talk about what they should be looking for in a therapist? Here are my own personal ideas, gleaned from making a lot of mistakes along the way. How do you find a well-trained therapist?  First off, it's important that any therapist we see for lymphedema (LE) is well trained. No state currently mandates training standards for LE therapists, but that doesn't mean there aren't any. The National Lymphedema Network and the Lymphology Association of North America (and other in-the-know LE organizations) agree that training should involve at least 135 hours of specifically LE instruction (1/3 classroom and 2/3 hands-on) beyond their Physical Therapist or Occupational Therapist certification, and at least a year's experience treating LE. (Doctors, nurses, and therapeutic massage therapists can also take LE training, but their services are not currently covered by Medicare, for some perverse reason.) So, before you see any LE therapist, be sure to ask about their training. (Warning: they may tell you they're \"certified,\" but that may only mean they're certified by their week-long school -- it's not enough! If, on the other hand, they tell you they're \"LANA certified,\" that means they've had the required training.) To learn more about what to look for as far as therapist training, the NLN has a Position Paper on Therapist Training here: www.lymphnet.org More to the point, here are some web sites for locating fully trained therapists near you: The Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. Click on the Locator and follow all the links. Some will give you results online, others ask for your zip code and email and will promptly send you names of nearby therapists. Most of the links provide international listings. The Lymphology Association of North America at www.clt-lana.org. Click on Therapist Listings. In the UK, try www.mlduk.org.uk. What should a therapist do about your LE?  So, okay, I find this therapist, I get the referral from any member of my healthcare team, I make the appointment and...what should I expect? The NLN (www.lymphnet.org) also has a Position Paper on Therapy that tells us what the accepted protocol is. Even for early stage LE, Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) is what we're after. It involves COMPRESSION (bandaging with special short-stretch bandages until the swelling is reduced, then fitting for compression garments to maintain the size of the arm and texture of the skin), MANUAL LYMPH DRAINAGE (a special, gentle, directional massage that moves lymph fluid out and helps encourage it to drain in new channels), EXERCISES (while wrapped, to encourage lymph flow), and SKIN CARE (to protect against breaks that can allow bacteria to start an infection). The massage and wrapping should be done by the therapist, not by you. But in the end s/he needs to teach you to do these yourself as tools to help you maintain the reduction in your arm or breast/chest. Measuring is done at intervals during therapy, and the therapist should be able to tell you the volume reduction (or lack thereof!) What if our therapist isn't doing these things? We hire these people, so we need to feel free to ask about anything we don't understand. If the answers aren't there, it's time to find someone new. Fully-trained therapists operate as free agents in their practice, and like anyone else they can get sloppy, or stubborn, or overworked and take shortcuts. Those shortcuts can put us at risk for LE progression or serious infection, so we can't afford to be afraid to ask tough questions or find a new therapist. The relationship with our LE therapists is a long-term one. We need to feel comfortable calling them in an emergency, picking up with visits if things get out of hand, or checking out new developments in the LE field. If the thought of contacting your therapist makes you anxious or hesitant, consider looking around for someone else. Therapists are people too.  There are things we can do to help them. When I find new research or new LE products, I pass that information on to my therapist. I write her thank you notes for the many extra, generous things she does (she's a gem!) I sent a letter of commendation about her to the local chapter of the OT's professional organization, and they sent her a notice and put it in her file (for whatever that may be worth!) I try not to expect her to solve all my LE problems within 5 minutes (though that's not easy!) And I try not to whine the entire time we're together. I drop her a note from time to time to tell her I'm doing well, or that something she suggested is working, because I want to keep up my end of this relationship. A final disclaimer:  Again, this is my own experience and take on it, but I've tried to note my sources so you can look them up too and make the decisions that are best for you. I'd love to hear what others have discovered along this road and what suggestions you all have for making the patient/therapist relationship a good one. Whew! Binney  Log in to post a reply",

Nanna, have you tried doing the compression (wrapping or garments) all day, even when you're going out? It's rotten, but you need to know if that works for you or not, so you can make your self-treatment decisions more freely. We all make our own compromises with the self-care, but we can't really choose what we want to do about it unless we know for sure what works. If you've given it a fair trial and it isn't working, you definitely need to ask for more help from your therapist, or a second opinion from another one. We all need to leave the cancer behind and move on. With lymphedema that comes from learning all the management tricks we can and staying on top of it, so we can take back control of our lives.You'll get there, Nannajean -- hang in there!

All I can say is, keep a careful watch on this after it heals, see if your doc will give you antibiotics to keep on hand, and if it happens again go see an infectious disease specialist. In some cases a long term low-dose antibiotic regimen is advisable for avoiding future bouts of the rotten stuff. How's the pain level? Please rest up and take good care of you.

Another fairly easy donner is the Ezy-As: http://www.ezyasabc.com/ This one works for arms and legs both (different sizes), and there's an extension that you can use if you can't bend over. It takes a bit of strength to put the stocking over the donner, so not sure how good that would be for doing it herself, but it would be something you could do for her and then she could pull it on herself.

I use a very low compression (15-20mm/Hg) on my lower right leg, and some mornings its all I can do to get them over my heel. I dread the thought of having to go up to even a 20-30 (though if I do I'm getting a \"Doff'n'Donner\" for sure!), but for many people with leg LE the standard compression is even higher than that (the point being that with legs, gravity is a huge factor in making the process of pumping lymph fluid back up to the core really difficult!) If I were trying to put a compression stocking on someone else, my arm and chest LE would definitely object.  I think the hard plastic donner you're talking about is the Ezy-As that I linked above. Once the stocking is on the hard plastic donner it's fairly easy to put on, but someone who has just had delicate eye procedures and is not supposed to strain is not going to be able to get in onto the donner herself. So if Crystal can get there every day to help that's an option, but if she can't, the Doff'n'Donner's a better choice. Crystal, for sick days I wrap--it's a pain when I'm not feeling well, but it works so well and it's so adjustable that I'm way more comfortable. If it gets to feeling too tight or too loose I remove only the top layer and re-wrap, which is much less effort than doing the whole thing. Not ideal, but the best I can do. Be well! Binney",

So be sure to have the therapist not only show you, but watch you do it so she can give you some tips about managing the weight of the leg. Since it's layered, you can rest between layers and do some slow, gentle arm exercises before applying the next layer. My, the learning curves we face with LE!

If you've been treated for breast cancer, you're at risk for lymphedema (LE). Anything that damages your arm (or chest) can lead to LE developing. If you get a sunburn your body will normally send extra lymph to the offended area to haul off dead cells, bacteria, and other debris. If your lymph system is already compromised by bc treatment, then that extra lymph fluid could overwhelm it and -- ka-boom! (Well, maybe not the sound effects, but you get the picture...) Here's another problem. Because your lymph system is already compromised, you may already have stagnant lymph fluid in your arm tissue (because up to 30% more lymph fluid than normal can be present before any swelling can be detected.)  This stuff is protein rich and bacteria love it, so if you compromise your skin with a sunburn you could trigger an infection more easily than you would if your lymph system were entirely healthy. And that infection would also draw more lymph fluid to the area, so ka-boom again.   You might want to know some other risk reduction stategies from the National Lymphedema Network: www.lymphnet.org. Honestly! Ask a simple question and I can ramble on for an hour! Short answer: protect yourself from sunburn  But for goodness sake don't stress! Go out there and enjoy the good ol' summertime!

And yes, we're weary and depleted from all the tests and treatments and terrors of bc. And no, we don't want to think about it anymore, and we for sure don't want our stupid swollen hands and arms (or chests or breasts) reminding us constantly about everything we've been through. And besides all that, wearing garments that we can't hide is humiliating and awkward, and the last thing we need is people staring at us and asking us stupid questions that don't have easy answers. But we are tough women, and we are worth every bit of effort and adjustment it takes to be truly healthy and well. When our arms and hands swell and hurt we are not only put out, we are risking infection, progression of the lymphedema, inflammation, fibrosis, skin changes, and further internal damage. We won't stay well and strong unless we do what we need to now to control this rotten condition. A glove is awkward, but I type all day in one (well, actually in two -- my lymphedema is in both hands). It can be done. I've used both off-the-shelf and custom gloves -- and today, because of a flare, I'm typing this at speed with my hand and arm wrapped in layered bandages. I couldn't do it the first time I tried -- it took a lot of effort and tears and ranting, but in the end it's doable. Ask your therapist for hand-strengthening exercises -- hey! we're going to end up even stronger than we were before! A glove feels embarrassing, but why should we allow ourselves to feel humiliated for taking excellent care of our condition, or for taking charge of a very difficult and distressing situation? There is no way we're to blame for this, and we never need to explain to anyone any more than we're comfortable explaining. But we do need to have the freedom to wear whatever hand compression we NEED, not what we imagine others will approve of. In fact, one thing I have learned in my six stupid years with lymphedema is that other people ALWAYS take their cues from me about what to think about my garments. If I'm comfortable with it (or if I ACT comfortable with it even when I'm cringing inside) they decide it's perfectly acceptable. This goes for everything from shaking hands at a party, to joining friends or new acquaintences for lunch, to taking Communion at church. If I'm uncomfortable, I make others uncomfortable. If I'm cool with it, so are they. It helps to have a range of answers ready depending on the situation and your mood at the time, everything from a 5-minute dissertation on the biology of the lymph system to a simple, \"Trapeze accident.\" But WE control what we wear and what we say about it -- this is not open for social approval to dictate. We are tough women, not controlled by social pressure. We only need to deal with this one day at a time. It is not about forever, it's about doing what we need to do for ourselves today. When we take care of ourselves well today, we have a better chance of staying strong and well to do our jobs and care for our families on-going. Stay strong! Binney",

Before you accept a pump, do be sure it's what YOU want and need. If your therapist is recommending it and you don't trust her on this, find another therapist. All pumps are NOT good for all patients -- consideration of any pump should be a careful decision arrived at by you and your therapist together, preferably only when other more standard forms of self-care have failed.

They might be licensed PTs or OTs, but unfortunately the extent of their lymphedema training can remain a problem, since no state currently legislates standards for them. My first lymphedema therapist had a grand total of four days of training in lymphedema therapy and, like yours, told me I didn't need a glove or gauntlet. My \"vacation\" to Alaska turned into a very worrisome time when my hand swelled on the flight there -- ugh! So you might want to ask your onc for another prescription for a gauntlet. If you decide not to wear it you'll at least have it with you. (Indications of impending problems include achiness or heaviness in your arm, tingling, or just feeling \"funny.\") The important issue with garments is an excellent fit. Here's information about how to know if the fit is right for you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm  I'd think once you'd been in Keystone for awhile your lymph system would adjust so you could do without wearing the garments. But if you're doing any unusual activities while there, they'll be useful for those times as well. Don them again for the trip home. Packing can be a strenuous activity, with all the lifting and lugging, so consider wearing them while you pack as well. Your plans to stay well exercised and hydrated are great. Add some deep breathing as well -- it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies and that helps pump lymph fluid. And for goodness sake have a GREAT time! Be well, Binney",

I'll second Kira's thoughts -- if you're not comfortable, either have an honest chat with her about your  concerns or get a second opinion. Lymphedema therapists are few and unregulated, frequently even unsupervised, so it's not surprising that they might have their quirks and pet passions. I can think of reasons why she might suggest a compression shirt and shorts, but that's not a very usual recommendation. If you've had reconstruction that involves abdominal surgery (DIEP, say, or tram flap), she might be concerned about creating problems with abdominal lymphedema if she's moving the fluid from your chest and arm down to your groin. But that's not very likely, so perhaps she's had a patient in the past who had that problem and is now being extra cautious. Maybe ask her what that's about. As for not wanting to get radiation on her hands, I certainly hope she was joking (though if she was it wasn't real funny). There are some chemo drugs that can cause skin reactions in therapists if they massage within a few hours of infusion (or so they say -- don't know if that's true or not), so perhaps that was the framework for her joke. Either way, you do want to find out how she'll manage skin issues from the radiation as you progress through treatment. The breast/chest area is an important part of Manual Lymphatic Drainage, so you need to understand what the plan is for both protecting that area and controling the lymphedema -- which can be exacerbated by rads. The link Kira posted above about therapists also outlines what to expect from treatment (as does a Position Paper on the National Lymphedema Network site: www.lymphnet.org )  Within the NLN guidelines, the four days a week for three weeks makes sense. Two days a week doesn't generally accomplish much unless by then she's taught you to do self-massage and wrapping so you can maintain the treatment between visits. In other words, go with your gut! This is a person you really need to be comfortable with, since even after therapy ends you'll need someone you can check in with and contact for on-going information and advice. She's raised some flags, but they all may have sensible explanations that she can help you understand and be comfortable with. Let us know what you discover! And be well, Ellen! Binney",

The good news is that it sounds like you've landed with a really smart and on-the-ball LE therapist. Whew! The Velcro wrap alternatives have worked well for most folks, and they're definitely easier to learn to manage. Traditional wrapping is a steep learning curve, but for some of us it's more effective and a good skill to have in our LE toolbox. One thing to do for sure is to have your new therapist go over the Manual Lymph Drainage with you to assure that you're still doing it correctly, as you'll want to do that daily as well. Also, be sure she goes over some personalized cellulitis risk reduction strategies so you can move forward confidently. You're so right--cellulitis is NOT an experience anybody wants to repeat! Do keep us posted, and tell us how we can help! Gentle hugs, Binney",

I also think this varies by fabric. I'm compression-sensitive and need a soft fabric that's normally used for neonates and older people with fragile skin, and it doesn't hold up as well as the tougher fabrics, so I have to replace them a bit before the magic six-month mark. I also think some fabrics will hold up well longer than six months, but no garment maker wants to be responsible for telling you that. Darker garments don't show the grubby ground-in dirt and food stains like lighter garments do, so that could be an issue too as far as when you want to replace them. (Then again maybe you're a lot less piggy than I am!) It's a good idea to be re-measured each time, even if you think they still fit. If you write the date you received them on the tag with a laundry marker it's easier to figure out when to re-order. And if your insurance is paying, you may also need their approval before the order can be processed, so remember to allow time for the whole stupid process. Why do I know that? Because I ordered new garments last month, September 17, and I haven't heard back yet from the DME supplier. So I just called them this morning and they said the insurance hadn't approved it yet. But when I pressed that point, it turned out that -- oops! -- the DME supplier hadn't even gotten around to sending it to my insurance for approval. They apologized all over the place of course, but my gloves are falling apart and we still have a loooooong way to go here! The moral to this story is: call at least weekly and pester people about your garments. (Why is this my job and not theirs?????) Sigh! Binney",

We're all different, and there's no way at present to predict any one individual's risk of developing lymphedema (LE). You may find that, for you, it causes problems. Or you may find it's fine. Starting and proceeding slowly is great advice, but not easy to follow. If you're like me, you want to do all you can, get moving again, \"no pain, no gain.\" But reducing your LE risk means paying attention to your body, knowing the symptoms to look out for, and stopping at once when you sense any stress. Aching, heaviness, or any strain at all are all signs of needing to stop. Rest, elevate your arm if possible, and go back to it another day more cautiously. Bobbie's idea of getting a referral to a well-trained LE therapist for evaluation, baseline measurements, and tips for avoiding LE is a wonderful idea, and I really wish it were standard treatment for all women facing bc treatment. But unfortunately it's not, so you may have to do some insisting. Also important: being fitted by an experienced therapist or fitter for compression sleeves and gloves to wear while exercising or traveling, or even for heavy housework. In the meantime, there's good LE information at the National Lymphedema Network website, especially their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Plane Travel: www.lymphnet.org Be well!

Do you happen to know if it was a Riancorp cool laser, as that's what's FDA approved, and if so, have you contacted them to let them know about this possible \"adverse effect\" (which is apparently the medical term for \"disaster\")? I think it's an important message. I have gotten some interesting responses and will share them with you as soon as I can sort them out. This BP is new to me, and I'm trying hard to get my mind around it. Barbara, am I correct in remembering from your ACOR posts that you have LE therapy once or twice a week, with a therapist who came highly recommended? May I ask why it's once or twice a week, and how you manage the swelling between therapy visits? The reason I'm asking is because I'm running into one consistent assertion from the people I'm talking to who have experience treating LE in combination with BP. They're unanimously hopeful that the swelling can, in fact be reduced and controlled, but the therapy has to be right for your situation. The goals would be to decrease limb weight, offset dependent (hanging down) positions with compression and support, and protect the arm from harm and skin erosion, and those goals are apparently possible with the right interventions. This would decrease the threat of infection as well, which in itself is worth whatever effort it takes to get there. OF COURSE you don't have to answer me if you don't want to. I'm aware I must be coming off as intrusive here, but I'm surprised at how commonplace BP is among some of these therapists, when it seems so \"out there\" from the patient perspective -- lonely and isolating. Shari, I can't use my right (dominant) arm for much either, but just due to the LE. But typing is out, because it causes my hand and arm to swell. So awhile back I bought a left-hand-only keyboard called a FrogPad that is small and easy to use and has all the functions of a full keyboard. It did mean I had to relearn the keyboard (back to Typing 101, which I didn't even like the first time around!), but within a few months my typing speed was back up to what it had been two-handed. Something to think about anyway. It's here, if you'd like to look it over: www.frogpad.com Hugs all around! Binney ",

Goodness! An English major, huh? In that case, typing all lower case must be cruel and unusual punishment for sure! It's the patients of therapists that have BP, but what gets me is that the therapists find it fairly common. So where are all these people? Like you, I never do see them running around, even when I go to the sorts of events where bc verterans hang out. I have to agree, they must be staying home, which is a possibility that really tears me up. I'm assuming you and Shari are shopping for long sleeves to \"hide\" the compression sleeves, yes? Do you know you can get them in a wide variety of colors from Juzo or Bio-Concepts, and in patterns from Lymphedivas?

Let me go contact the RAGE folks and see what they have to say. I'll let you know what I hear. There was another new piece of information I wanted to share with you. In the May 11, 2009 issue of the New Yorker there's an article by John Colapinto called \"Brain Games,\" about a neuroscientist named V. Ramachandran at U.C. San Diego who has done some surprising interventions with limb pain (including phantom pain). His specialty deals with how we perceive pain, and how our brains can be modified (or even fooled) to stop the pain reaction.There are few details on this particular trick in the article, just a mention, but if you're intersted in pursuing it I'll see if he'll give us more guidelines. Here's the quote --Colapinto is listing some items in Ramachandran's lab: \"...several plastic minimizing lenses (Ramachandran has found that viewing a painful arm or leg through a lens that makes the limb look smaller dramatically reduces pain)...\" You can see why that jumped out at me. I googled \"minimizing lens\" and nothing came up, so I'll keep trying other terms and see if I can find where to get one to try. There's no mention of how long it takes to get the pain relief effect or how long it lasts, but his work with phantom pain suggests that 10 minutes twice a day for two weeks can permanently change the brain's perceptions of pain. Of course phantom pain is exactly that: phantom, not really \"there,\" while RIBP pain is a continual process, but in the case of the minimizing lens he wasn't referring to phantom pain, so perhaps it's hopeful. If all else fails we can try contacting him directly and asking for details. Let me know if you'd like me to do that. Two other news items: SOME UNIVERSITIES ARE STARTING TO PUT TEXT BOOKS ON KINDLE. So if anyone is interested in taking a course or two, or even going back for a degree, ask at your local college or university about this option and don't let the awkwardness, weight, (or price!) or the textbooks stand in your way. A PROMINANT LYMPHEDEMA RESEARCHER WILL SOON BE STARTING A PRILIMINARY STUDY ON THE REALITY OF RIBP. This first study wil be a \"phenomenological\" study, which means they'll be needing patients to interview about their personal experiences with RIBP. The information they gather will be put together and shared so that both research and treatment needs can be identified -- and hopefully followed up on. The reason I'm so excited about this is that several years ago there were similar phenomenological studies done about women with post-bc lymphedema, and it really made the research world sit up and take notice. Right now, RIBP is invisible, but with a published study it will start to be addressed by both the researchers (who can look into cures and prevention) and the therapists (who could help develop ways to manage it). Participating in this study would not require you to travel, just to participate in a phone interview. I sure hope you'll all be willing to help with this. I'll post the details as they become available I'm so relieved to see this process starting, even if the steps are maddeningly slow. The amazing thing about this bit of progress is that YOU ARE THE ONES WHO MADE IT POSSIBLE -- you, Erica, by starting this thread, and the rest of you by responding and sharing your experiences. It's this thread that has brought RIBP to the attention of the lymphedema community and its researchers. How crazy is that?!! Chocolate all around! And hugs too, of course, Binney",

Okay, FINALLY! The survey we've talked about in the past is finally on-line and ready for your participation. The first part of it is for any woman who has been treated for breast cancer. That part should only take 10-15 minutes to complete, but following that is a SECTION JUST FOR WOMEN WITH RIBP! It was designed from all the questions you provided, and there are boxes to write about your experience. There is also a box at the end to write anything else you'd like to say about it that wasn't specifically covered by the questions. So the RIBP part will take considerably longer to complete. Please allow lots of time, and if necessary ask someone to help with the typing so you don't tire. Here's why it's important. Obviously, little is known by the medical community about the actual experience of RIBP, whether symptoms, interventions, psycho-social impact, or coping issues. This survey will help doctors and researchers identify needs for both treatment and further study. In the more immediate future, this survey will be used as a basis for an issue of LymphLink, the newsletter of the National Lymphedema Network, that for the first time ever will focus on RIBP. It will also be used in the workshop on RIBP planned for the International Professionals' Conference this September, to acquaint medical professionals with patient needs and experience -- something that's obviously lacking! In other words, by responding to this survey you will be able to make your voice heard within the medical community in ways that have not been possible before. PLEASE make the time to fill out the survey and express your experience and your needs. I'll post the official notice below, which contains a link to the survey site. THANK YOU, ALL! I'm so grateful to know every one of you -- you've made so much difference in my life. Hugs, prayers, Binney Announcing a research study by Dr. Mei Fu of New York University School of Nursing, and StepUp-SpeakOut.org. Please participate! We would value your response to the questions on our on-line survey regarding Breast Cancer and Lymphedema Symptom Experience If you are a female 21 years of age or older and have been diagnosed with and treated surgically for breast cancer, you are invited to share your experience of breast cancer in this online study. The purpose of this study is to examine the reliability and validity of the Breast Cancer and Lymphedema Symptom Experience Index, an instrument to evaluate breast cancer survivors' symptom experience. Your valuable input will help researchers better understand women's experiences of breast cancer, including symptoms, distress, and quality of life. Ultimately, the information obtained from the study will help to gain insights into the needs of women who have survived breast cancer so that more personalized care can be provided. The New York University Institutional Review Board  \"IRB\" (an ethical review board that monitors research involving human subjects) has approved this research study. The study is brief and will take about 10-15 minutes of your time. (Please allow extra time for the RIBP section). You can skip any questions that you might feel uncomfortable answering. Your participation is voluntary and anonymous. We will keep your responses confidential. Your input is valuable. Please take the time to complete this survey. We appreciate your response!

He's also associated with both the International Society of Lymphology and the National Lymphedema Network. So far this entry in his blog is just a description of RIBP, but the next blog entry will deal with treatment, with an emphasis on the lymphedema end of it. It's here: http://www.lymphedemablog.com/2011/01/28/radiation-induced-brachial-plexopathy-and-lymphedema/ I'm so cheered to see it even arise as a subject -- hopefully we can expand the discussion he's begun so that medical professionals will begin to put together some better strategies. Barbara, I had a wonderful talk with Ronimom and wanted to share with you that the Feldekrais has given her ways to control her arm and shoulder, which makes it possible for her to avoid getting her arm \"stuck\" behind (say, on the steering wheel as she exits the car) when she's moving in another direction. It has also given her confidence that she simply didn't have before because it allows her to move with grace. It's a method that increases both our awareness and control over the muscles we still use, to compensate for those we don't. Ronimom's trainer is a real pro, so I've asked her to write about it for our StepUp-SpeakOut RIBP page and to explain how we can find experienced Feldenkrais practitioners nearby. We will be up-dating the RIBP page shortly (hopefully today!) with abstracts of all recent RIBP research, some more tips for gadgets and goodies you've all suggested, and information about kinesio taping for shoulder stabilization. More news soon! You're so right, Barbara -- the world really is waiting for good news, and hopefully some of this will be exactly that! Hugs all around, Binney",

All your questions are real stumpers, so I'll just \"think outloud\" about some of them and hope it might lead you to new answers. First, have any of your doctors checked you out for Raynaud's Syndrome? The earlier issues you had with blue-then-red hands and your current problem with redness post-MLD would seem to hint at the kind of condition that defines Raynaud's. Just a thought. Have you tried loosening up on the wraps and garments? It could be you're compression sensitive, in which case \"less\" compression is \"more.\" You might try a 15-20 mm/Hg instead of 20-30. And look for a garment with a fabric that has a lower containment factor than whatever you've been wearing (Gottfried, for instance, or a Juzo Dream Sleeve). My wrapping has to be very loose compared to what is \"normal,\" or my fingers turn blue and I swell immediately after taking off the wraps. (That swelling is called \"rebound swelling\" and is sort of a snotty lymph system response to being too tightly compressed.) On the other hand, my truncal LE will swell within 15 minutes without compression -- the refill time is very individual. My hands and arms are okay without compression for a couple of hours (as long as I'm not doing anything more strenuous than watching TV or reading a book), but my trunk reswells very quickly. (Fortunately it also reduces fairly quickly with proper compression). Not sure why you need to remove compression for OT? Sounds like a bad idea if there's any way you can avoid it. Maybe remove it for the initial eval, but having some compression on your arm and hand as you're using it is what helps move the lymph fluid, so it would seem like an ideal time to use compression. On the Farrow arm garment I'm assuming you could wrap or use a day glove with it, or even perhaps a night garment glove from Jovi-pac. (Farrow also makes a gauntlet that wraps like that, but I wouldn't recommend it. I tried it last year at a trade show and found it stiff and uncomfortable.) I sure hope you'll find the solutions you need. Do let us know what you discover. Gentle hugs, Binney",

A good LE therapist also needs to be involved, as a dependent or painful arm needs extra help to keep the fluid moving. And an occupational therapist can help with adjustment to specific activities of daily living when one arm is disabled. The real trick is getting your insurance to see it that way, since they want to see progress toward a \"cure\" in order to continue to fund it. So that part might take some appeals in order to get what you need.  Hugs! Binney",

      "Content": "Jul 31, 2008 05:00PM - edited Jul 31, 2008 05:01PM by Binney4 Hi, Shari and Barbara, Shari, are you talking about the BP team at Cincinnati Children's Hospital? I found this quote about the treatment options there (of course they're for infants, but still perhaps there are seeds of hope in there somewhere):  \"Brachial Plexus Treatment Techniques We use a combination of techniques to treat brachial plexus injuries, including family input to determine the best treatment approach for each child. Microsurgical nerve repair may be undertaken as early as 3-6 months of age with the use of EMG and MRI imaging to gather specific evidence of the brachial plexus injury. Our surgeons also perform tendon transfers, orthopaedic procedures and other secondary surgeries. Therapy may include home exercise programming, therapeutic electrical stimulation, orthotic fabrication, aquatic therapy and family education as the most important aspect of treatment.\"  And this web site that has links to a lot of material: http://www.cincinnatichildrens.org/svc/alpha/b/brachial-plexus/resources/default.htm One of the links on the above page led to this page, which has some presentations from a (pediatric) BP conference: http://seraph.cchmc.org/MediasiteEX/Catalog/?cid=20280029-9c4a-42e4-a755-ca55d99f3609 I haven't had a chance to look it all over yet, but thought I'd post it in case you wanted to read it too. Hope the links work! Barbara, I think the LympheDivas attitude is an \"in your face!\" thing, and I personally feel like cheering when I see it. Why should I have to hide out? And how CAN I anyway -- even with long sleeves my gloves are right out there for everyone to see. And who wears gloves in the AZ desert when it's 115 degrees out there? It ain't natural! So it does cause a lot of stares and even a lot of (sometimes really stupid) questions. I've tried joshing. Once when I had one arm wrapped and the other one in garments, with my heavy-duty chest compression vest making me look like a sumo wrestler, a crusty old man came up to me at the mall and said, \"What the heck happened to you?\" To which I smugly replied, \"You should see the other guy!\" and raised my gloved fist for emphasis. Clever, huh? Uh-uh. He says, \"I don't see how anybody could look any worse off than you do!\"  So after that I tried a few other quickies. LympheDivas had a list of good \"explanations\", my favorite being: \"Trapeze accident!\" But in the end I'm just better off telling curious people a few things about it. Their eyes glaze over, they shift their feet in miserable boredom while I explain in grim detail the operation of the lymphatic system and the little-known hazards of bc surgery. They're undoubtedly sorry they asked, but at least I don't think they'll ever forget it. For me, the hardest to deal with are our bc Sisters, our \"fellow-survivors\" as everybody calls them. For the most part they DO know what my garments mean, and they don't want to talk about it. At a gathering of bc veterans (I hate the term \"survivor\"), where all the women are strangers but they're greeting each other like long-lost cousins because of their shared bc experience, they'll take one look at me and say, \"Oh, lymphedema, huh! Man! I'm sure glad I missed that one!\" Not exactly a conversation starter for me! I'm really not complaining here. I even understand them. And in my better moments I actually appreciate the humor in the situations. But I just wanted to bring these things up because I think they affect us a lot and sometimes I forget how much of a strain they are on me and then wonder why I have a melt-down. All that just to say, I finally gave up any attempt at camouflage because it's useless, and I'm happier not feeling like I have to stay out of sight. And I think that's the mind-set the LympheDivas are appealing to, too. So I wear colored sleeves from Bio-Concepts, because then at least the sleeves match the gloves and I don't look like I was patched together. Not sure anything would actually make me feel better out in public except being able to forget about it entirely. But for me, hoping not to be noticed doesn't achieve that oblivian. Better to look confidant, even if I don't always feel that way. Does that make any kind of sense? Hope it's not 115 degrees where you live! Binney P.S. - Sorry this got so LONG!",

      "Content": "Aug 2, 2008 10:11PM Binney4 wrote: Shari, either I'm somewhere in the Twilight Zone, or else you just changed your screen name -- sure hope it's the name change and not my mind givng out completely! I've been trying to sort out the information I've been receiving on BP and LE, but there's a lot of it and it's a lot to take in. First let me say that the LE therapists I've contacted agree that both RIF and BP are something they see fairly frequently (so where ARE these people?!), though the BP was more common a decade or more ago when they used cobalt radiation. Not so common now and pretty much restricted to those who receive two or more fields of rads, especially if they overlap. As for the use of laser treatment, those I talked to consider that to be still a \"fringe\" treatment -- not thoroughly vetted by research for actual efficacy or possible long-term side effects. They made clear that radiation fibrosis is different from lymphostatic fibrosis (fibrosis caused by accumulated lymph fluid due to LE) or surgical scarring. So even if laser treatment were to be proven effective in treating LE and scar tissue from surgery, it would still not be proven to be safe in treating RIF. In other words, they weren't willing to say the laser treatment DID contribute to the BP, but they certainly supported the possibility and encouraged your warnings about it. From the standpoint of getting help for the BP from treatment of the LE, here is what I've learned from them. I'm going to quote one of them directly, and though I don't want to use his name without his permission on this public forum, I'd be happy to let you know who he is and what his credentials are if you Private Message me. Here's what he says: \"BP sets the stage for dependency, lack of control, shoulder subluxation and other problems. If we can reduce the edema, we can decrease limb weight, offset dependent positions with compression and support, protect the arm better from harm and skin erosion and this alone makes a world of difference.\" By \"dependency\" he means the arm hangs down and gets less movement and use than is normal. \"Shoulder subluxation\" means partial dislocation of the joint -- which is painful and further damaging to the nerves. What he's saying (and this is from a wealth of experience) is that it is possible and desirable not only to treat the LE, but to treat it so well that the swelling is reduced as much as it can possibly be. The complete reduction of swelling may well mean less pain, less on-going damage to the nerves, and an increased capacity to raise the arm enough to support it. That in turn will control the LE, so you've set up a cycle of improved control and confidence, instead of the present one of continuing damage and deterioration. BUT, both the men I talked to stressed that the therapist needs to be expert in treating BP. He's talking about really careful control of the LE too, being aggressive and creative about finding ways to get the swelling down and keep it that way. Barbara, I know you like your therapist, and for all I know she's well experienced in treating BP. But according to your posts, your LE is not completely controlled. The opinion of these men is that is CAN be, and that in doing that you may find that you're more comfortable and more in charge of your life again. Shari, I don't remember if it was you or Sherry who was experiencing more tingling in fingers, but excellent LE control might also control that as well, since the weight of any extra fluid in the arm (especially when it's hanging down) is damaging to the nerves. With LE, there's as much as 30% more fluid in the tissue than is normal before any swelling is even noticable, so by the time there's visible swelling we're toting around a LOT of excess fluid. Maybe you can see why that was difficult for me to sort out. I don't know your situations, so I have no idea how any of that hits you. I hope it's helpful, but it's not at all the complete cure we're all wishing for. Still, I think there's hope in it. Anything that lets us take back some of the control in our life is a very good thing. Enough of all that. Barbara, I do have to cope with the curiosity of kids, and to tell you the truth I find their open interest much easier to handle than the fleeting, embarrassed glances of the adults. With young ones who ask about the garments I usually just say something like, \"I like them. Do you?\" When I'm bandaged, though, I tell them it doesn't hurt first, then follow that up with whatever settles their curiosity. Usually just knowing it doesn't hurt is all they really need. Older kids need better answers, but I never tell them more than they ask. \"What happened to you?\" gets the answer, \"I had some surgery and now I need to wear these to get well.\" I had one kid, about 8  or so, who persisted with questions (in a restaurant, no less!) so I told him I'd had a kind of cancer and the treatment was very hard and left me with a swollen arm, and this was a way to keep it from getting more swollen. He proceeded to tell me that he was going to be a scientist when he grew up, and he planned to find a cure for cancer. He said he'd found out that sharks never get cancer, so he was going to figure out just what it was about them that kept them safe, and then he'd make sure people had whatever-it-was too. I hope he does it! Okay, having written a book-length post here I think I'd better quit. Sorry to run on! Have a restful night! Binney ",

When Erica started this thread a long time ago she posted it on several boards besides this one, but this is the one that others started posting on, so this is where it stuck. (Where BC is concerned, being under 40 can make a difference to the treatment plan, and these are the gals that usually have kids still at home, so they have that to share, along with other \"younger\" issues.) I think I mentioned that it was JoviPak that came up with that \"sling\" loop on a night garment for a \"flaccid arm.\" They're an inventive group. I use a night garment made by Solaris-Tribute. (The advantage is you can put it in the dryer.) There's another company that makes night garments too, called Telesto-Medtech. It's a new company, but the owner is the engineer who invented directional stitching and worked with both Jovi and Solaris, so he's an old hand at this. His garments are much less expensive, if you're paying for these out-of-pocket. His wife had LE (he lost her to Stage IV BC), and he has a real heart for those of us who deal with it. (This is not an ad -- just information. I'm a firm believer in comparison shopping!) I sometimes wear my Solaris during the day just because it's more comfortable. I have an oversleeve for added compression that I wear when I'm having a flare-up, or you can wrap over it with short-stretch for added control (but for me the whole idea of the night sleeve is to avoid wrapping) Mine have zippers from the wrist to a few inches below the axilla so they're easy on (and off -- night being not just for sleeping, after all!) Sorry if I'm repeating myself here. I tend to lose track. How long do we get to claim chemo-brain? Is that a life-time perogative? (I hope, I hope!)

Radiation injury is more than just scar tissue. Scar tissue removal from nerves is sometimes part of node transfer surgery for lymphedema (Dr. Marga Massey, for instance, has talked about that) but whether it helps with any aspect of RIBP or not I don't know. Even if it could provide pain relief it might be worth considering, but I've never seen any claims one way or another. Could you ask him if he has any studies he could share with us? I'd be really interested to know what his experience has been. Hugs, Binney ",

It's so hard to make these choices when the possibility of regrets hangs over your head either way. Aaaaugh! Like you, mumayan, I found the rads far more difficult than chemo. Actually made myself a little chart with boxes on it for each treatment, then went out and bought cheery stickers I could put on my chart for every day I completed. I felt like a 4-year-old, having to reward myself with stickers! On the last day of treatment by rads onc couldn't stop telling me, \"I never thought you'd stick it out!\" Hmmm. Not a bit courageous...still, I'm glad I did it. The peace of mind has proven to be valuable to me. Ronimom, I couldn't agree more: \"LE is nasty\"! I hope Barbaraellen and Sharz won't mind if I tell you all that the three of us met last weekend in Phoenix and spent a delightful couple of days together. Sooooo neat to be able to talk and share and ask questions and even make plans. We thought about all the rest of you, wished you were with us in person, and I'd really like to make a quick summary of some of the ground we covered so you can join the discussion. Barbaraellen and Sharz, please correct me if I'm off base with any of it, and make any additions I've left out. I took a few notes, but mostly was too busy yakking to keep good ones, so I'm going a lot on memory here, and the brain is a sieve! 1. Pain is a very serious problem and is not being adequately addressed. Just like with LE, no one doctor \"owns\" or takes responsibility for RIBP management or checks on it consistently -- or even at all. SO we would like make doctors aware of RIBP and its diagnosis and treatment options, and their role in supporting, directing patients to proper resources, and controlling pain. 2. We're understanding from a couple of BP doctors that progression may be slowed by daily stretching and exercising of the arm and shoulder. BUT no one can suggest ways to exercise when control of the arm has been lost. Using the other hand has limitations, especially with the stretching. Therapists seem to be stymied by the complexity of dealing with pain, paralysis and lymphedema all at the same time. SO with the help of some willing and knowledgeable professionals, we would like to develop some exercise interventions and make that information available to other RIBPers and to therapists. 3. These same BP doctors also acknowledge that it's physiologically possible that the use of the low-level laser could trigger RIBP in someone at risk for it. SO we would like further studies to be done on laser use that would clarify the safety issues. 4. There are no guidelines for total RIBP treatment or treatment expectations, SO we would like to generate RIBP information for therapists that will guide them in recommending and carrying out on-going treatment for their patients with RIBP. 5. Because RIBP can lead to subluxation (partial dislocation) of the shoulder, we discussed the possibility that Kinesio taping might provide support for the subluxed shoulder in advancing RIBP. SO we would like to locate professionals who can give us information we can understand about the use of taping to support the shoulder. 6. Because of the psychosocial discomfort associated with swelling, wrapping, garment use, disability, and (as Barbaraellen so vividly puts it) \"club-like\" hanging arms, we're brain-storming ways to generate public awareness of both LE and BP, in particular as a side-effect of breast cancer treatment. SO, ladies!!! Anybody know how we can all go on Oprah and talk about this? ALL other suggestion, ideas, brain-storms, or rants cheerfully welcomed -- let's come up with some ways to get RIBP the attention it needs to make sure that treatment is adequate, prevention is possible, and research moves forward for better interventions and hopefully a cure. What thoughts? If you haven't already, please check out our newly re-arranged RIBP page at StepUp-SpeakOut.org, and let us know your thoughts on making that more helpful too. It's here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm (It's still a work in progress, with a few sections yet to be written but -- you get the idea!) Be well, all, Binney P.S - Our RIBP \"sisters\" in the UK suggested as a resource a book called \"One-Handed in a Two-Handed World\" by Tommye-K. Mayer. Anybody read it?",

So glad to hear you're taking charge of the stupid lymphedema -- keeping that in control should really help you avoid cellulitis, too. I hope the PT you're seeing is fully trained to treat lymphedema (that'd be at least 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training beyond her PT certification, and preferably at least a year's experience treating it). It can be hard to find one with those qualifications, because no state currently mandates training standards for lymphedema (why are we not surprised). The Circaid is helpful, but there are other options that are more flexible and comfortable. JoviPak makes night garments, as does Solaris-Tribute and Telesto-Medtech. All three of those are custom fit, flexible, and soft (but they're also bulky -- sorta like a long oven mitt.)  JoviPak will even make a sleeve/vest with an arm support especially to deal with BP. There's a picture of it here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Radiation_Induced_Brachial_plexopathy.htm#NIGHT%20GARMENTS0 But you'll want to be sure that the therapist has already reduced the swelling by wrapping and Manual Lymph Drainage massage, so that when you order garments they'll fit the \"new you\"! Because my lymphedema is bilateral and involves my chest as well, I use a JoviPak vest with attached sleeves and mitts -- I look like the abominable snowman going to bed, but fortunately my family (even my DH) is understanding and supportive -- they call it my \"mama bear outfit.\" It allows me to sleep relatively comfortably, it's WAAAAAAY easier to deal with than wrapping, and I wake up with my arms and chest in great shape. So for me -- I'm grateful for it! Let us know what you discover. Be well! Binney",

And on the other hand we'll be happy to read your capless posts here anytime, too. Let me try again. What I meant was, what questions do you think will best bring out the things you want to say? One of my thoughts was, \"What treatment options have you already tried (including complimentary or alternative), and how did they work (or not work)?\" Because the answers to that will bring out the issues of how the doctors didn't help and couldn't suggest anything useful. Or, \"How long did it take for you to get a diagnosis, and what did that process involve?\" Because then it will become clear that early diagnosis just isn't happening. I guess I'm asking you to think like they do on Jeopardy (have you ever watched that game show?), where you already know the answer and you have to make a question that asks for it.  Is that any better? Kind of difficult to explain. If you're going to be interviewed about RIBP (which you are!), then what do you want the interviewers to ask you so you'll be able to tell them the important points? You guys are the only experts. Clearly the medical folks don't even know what the issues are, so they need help asking the right questions in order to find out. The better we can direct their questions, the more they'll learn about the things we want them to know.  I don't know how you guys are reaching all the keys! Maybe my hands are just little, but I think I'd strain a muscle trying to get to some of those letters while holding down the cap. I use the FrogPad, which has all the keys in a very small area -- and they're all full-sized keys too. The learning curve was steep, but it's easy on my hand and I'm really glad I put in the time to learn it. Odd, but when I have to use a regular keyboard at the library, I have to stop and think where all the letters are. Shari, go for it all, then hurry home and tell us all about it! Hugs, Binney",

Ronimom, I love your happy news too and am really anxious to hear how it all unfolds for you. Encouragement from any quarter is so welcome. Bet the water exercise was wonderful for the lymphedema too. Barbara, yes, I agree that RIBP needs to be included in the med school learning programs. We do have to remain vigilant with the Lymphedema Framework Project (that you attended in Chicago awhile back) so that they don't fail to include it in the Best Practices documents that they end up with -- because that's going to influence the information taught in our med schools, the specialties that deal with it, and the development of a new medical specialty in conditions of the lymph system (which impacts RIBP as well). I just now discovered there's a Framework meetin in late August, but I haven't discovered where, or who can attend. Since you attended the one in Chicago, you might want to contact them and see what's up with the one in August and whether there's some way the RIBP gals can be represented there. Let me know if you discover anything, and I'll keep you posted as well. Hugs all around! Binney",

I just wanted to share that I spoke to a Chinese doctor last summer at the National Lymphedema Network international conference, who was trying to get started on a study of acupuncture for lymphedema treatment. She told me it has been used for all kinds of swelling in the Orient for centuries so it's an accepted practice there, but there have never been any evidence-based studies such as Western medicine uses to validate treatment effectiveness or safety. She feels that's important, so she's getting it started. She told me that to be effective, acupuncture need not be use in the affected quadrant of the body at all but can be done on the opposite side of the body just as well. (She also had nothing but scorn for American-trained acupuncturists, who she characterized as \"careless!\") I spoke to a LE therapist/friend about the use of a TENS unit on an arm with LE, and he suggested that since it can be used to stimulate muscles, that it be done with the arm either wrapped or in compression garments (same as when you stimulate the muscles by exercise.) He suggested starting off very low and moving up slowly over several days. BUT!! he also suggested that it not be used at all in radiated areas as it might damage unsheathed nerve fibers (since there are no studies to show safety of a TENS unit post-radiation). NOT something any of us want to do! That's my 2 cents, anyway. All just talk -- nothing definitive. (Sound familiar!) Hugs all around, Binney",

There are a number of things that can cause this, including infection, inflammation, a condition called sarcoidosis, cancer, and others. So this is a description of a symptom, but it's not a diagnosis one way or another. It just suggests further testing (a CT scan of the neck and chest) to try and get a definitive diagnosis. Even that may not tell them what the cause of the swollen nodes is, but it might rule out some of the possible causes and reduce the number of possible explanations. As for diagnosing RIBP, that really is a problem. It's rare enough that doctors see little of it and aren't used to making this call. Some of the gals here (barbaraellen and Sharz, for instance) have seen many doctors and done many tests before they were able to get their diagnosis \"for sure.\" It's great that RIBP is rare, but it sure doesn't help anyone with this condition get help. I hope you'll relax and wait out the testing period. Get copies of all reports and tests and organize them in a three-ring binder so that if you need to see another specialist for a second opinion you'll have everything s/he needs to make a determination.  None of which is much help, I'm afraid -- waiting is the most challenging part of this entire rotten process. I'm praying the CT can be scheduled soon, and that you'll find something delightful and absorbing to keep you busy in the meantime (a few funny movies? a new puzzle book? a good mystery? a new pet?).

You might try googling Axillary Web Syndrome, which is the umbrella categary that includes Mondor's. It is also called \"cording\" and can run from the axilla down the arm to the thumb (which makes reaching with your arm extremely painful) or from the axilla to the waist, through the breast or chest (though in both cases you may not be able to feel parts of the \"cord\"). Or both. It supposedly resolves on its own in a few weeks, though it may recur later for a few weeks again. Gentle stretches, especially if you do them in a warm shower, may also help. Or if it's especially troublesome some women find PT helps. If you find this is your problem it may be helpful to know that current research is leaning toward identifying cording with later development of lymphedema, since the \"cord\" is composed partly of lymph tissue. There are simple lifestyle changes you can make to reduce your risk of developing lymphedema. You can find and print these off from the Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise at the National Lymphedema Network web site: http://www.lymphnet.org I can't resist adding here (though I do understand no one wants to hear this ) that we are ALL at risk for lymphedema, both arm and chest/breast. Even those of us who have had SNB or a prophylactic mastectomy. The suggestions at the NLN site can make the rest of your long and healthy lives a whole lot happier!

The following notice from Bob includes a link for further information. I'm so hoping this will enable all of you who have been \"given up on\" by your insurance to receive the therapy that can control the lymphedema and protect the shoulder from damage. If you make use of this provision, please let us know how it goes! CMS Changes Claims Processing Manual to Clarify Non-Existent Improvement Standard In the case of Jimmo v. Sebelius,the Center for Medicare Advocacy (CMA) alleged that Medicare claims involving skilled care were being inappropriately denied by contractors based on a rule-of thumb \"Improvement Standard\" - under which a claim would be summarily denied due to a beneficiary's lack of restoration potential, even though the beneficiary did in fact require a covered level of skilled care inorder to prevent or slow further deterioration in his or her clinical condition. In the Jimmo lawsuit, CMS denied establishing an improper rule-of-thumb \"Improvement Standard.\" The settlement agreement is intended to clarify that when skilled services are required in order to provide care that is reasonable and necessary to prevent or slow further deterioration, coverage cannot be denied based on the absence ofpotential for improvement or restoration. The following are some significant aspects of the manual clarifications now being issued: \u2022Coverage depends not on the beneficiary\u2019s restoration potential, but on whether skilled care is required, along with the underlying reasonableness and necessity of the services themselves; \u2022While the presence of appropriate documentation is not, in and of itself, an element of the definition of a \u201cskilled\u201d service, such documentation serves as the means by which a provider would be able to establish and a Medicare contractor would be able to confirm that skilled care is, in fact, needed and received in a given case; \u2022When skilled services are required in order to provide care that is reasonable and necessary to prevent or slow further deterioration, coverage cannot be denied based on the absence of potential for improvement or restoration.

There's no evidence to support the idea that ALL cancer patients who develop LE are genetically predisposed, but there's no doubt that it's sometimes the case. There are two recent studies (2008, 2009) by Anthony Stanton in the UK that indicate \"a predisposition to BCRL [Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema] in some women.\" The abstract from the latest of those studies goes on to say, \"Further evidence for predisposing abnormalities is the finding of lymphatic abnormalities in the contralateral (nonswollen) arm in women with established BCRL. Such predisposing factors could explain why some women develop BCRL after sentinel node biopsy, whereas others do not after clearance surgery.\" You can find the abstract here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19302022 Unfortunately, even if that proves to be the case, we don't currently have any way of predicting which women are predisposed and which are not. So for now, at least, the risk reduction strategies apply to every one of us who has been treated for breast cancer. Here  are a couple of sites with information on risk reduction: http://www.lymphnet.org  (See their Position Papers on Exercise, Air Travel, and Risk Reduction) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Well, hey!

You don't mention lymphedema, but it is unfortunately a very common adjunct to have with RIBP. If you're getting some occupational therapy or physical therapy, that can help by keeping your arm moving, which helps to keep the lymph system pumping.

Until you can get in for an evaluation by a fully-trained lymphedema therapist (which you want to do promptly to avoid further swelling, fibrosis, and high infection risk), do go real easy on your arm. No strain, only gentle stretches. No hot water or ice packs; avoid cuts, scratches, insect bites. Stay VERY WELL hydrated (helps dilute lymph fluid and move it more easily). Stop throughout the day and take several slow, deep abdominal breathes (stimulates the largest lymph vessel in your body). From time to time, raise your arm above your head as far as is comfortable (no pain!) and slowly open and close your fist several times (the muscle movements help move lymph fluid down and back into circulation in your trunk). Keep your arm elevated as much as possible -- on the back of the couch or car seat, on pillows at night.

What good news that must be for those who have been suffering with it and find themselves relieved of it! Please keep us posted on your experience. Barbara and Sharz, help me here. I'm trying to understand what, exactly, the brachial plexopathy is -- what the mechanism is. Are you all saying that fibrosis is the culprit, and that breaking down the fibrosis would relieve or at least slow the deterioration? Is Sherri's RIF the same thing as brachial plexopathy? And if fibrosis is the problem, have any of you tried the Riancorp low-level laser? It's been recently approved for use in lymphedema treatment to break down fibrosis which is cause either by the initial surgery and/or rads, or by the stagnant lymph fluid itself. It's been quite successful in improving both the pain and the blockage of lymph flow, and so in reducing swelling as well. Barbara, you seem to have been \"around the block\" with just about everything that holds out any hope, so I'm guessing you've already tried it. No help?

As he was obviously assuming I'm a therapist, not a mere patient, it's written in dense \"medicalese\" that is well beyond my comprehension. But perhaps it would be useful to a therapist in treating this, so I'll post it as is and hope it helps someone: \"Please forgive the delay.  I just received this response from one of our instructors.  She mentions our database.  I am not sure if you use this but if not, please see our website for membership to access this.   From Instructor: On the data base, tapings can be found to decrease pectoralis muscle contraction,and  improve cervical and thoracic extension. Marinating neutral cervical spine and upper quarter posture is key to reducing musculoskeletal complications.  After radiation cycle is completed and with physician permission, fascial correction taping can be used to reduce the fibrotic tension in the tissue. One can also apply the tape directly over the plexus from \"one end to the other\" or over inflamed portions of the plexus per the data base (0138-NE-AR). After a professional assessment of pain patterns and  flexibility of the tissues, choose about 3 applications. Remember that the skin is the largest organ of the body. You do not want to overwhelm the patient with tape.

How handy that there's a doctor to consult close by, but how crazy is it to get there by way of Cincinnati?! Since the doc in Ohio suggested hyperbaric treatment I'll post what information I have about the hyperbaric chamber therapy for LE, even though I already emailed it to you. Hopefully it'll help others who might be reading along. It's part of an abstract from the August National Lymphedema Network professionals' conference. I'm afraid the news is not very good on the surface, but you should ask Dr. Foad if he has other information specific to your personal situation that would skew things in favor of trying this at this point. It's authored by Dr. Andrea Cheville, who's compassionate and extremely well-versed in LE -- and she's also having trouble finding patients to try out the hyperbaric therapy because of the time commitment and being inside what looks like a space station (she showed slides!) Here's the abstract: HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY FOR EARLY STAGE LYMPHEDEMA: PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL ANDREA L CHEVILLE, LUKE VELDERS, ANTHONY KILLIAN, STEPHEN THOM Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, U.S.A.; Center for Environmental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, U.S.A. Background: Hypberbaric oxygen (HBO2) attenuates breast edema associated with radiation therapy. However use of HBO2 to treat established breast cancer-related lympedema has yielded disappointing results. We hypothesized that the lack of effi cacy is due to a temporal effect such that HBO2 must be administered within a finite time interval following radiation treatment. Methods:  Twenty five breast cancer patients who developed lymphedema, defi ned by CTC v3.0 criteria, within 24 months of completing radiation and had completed Phase I complex decongestive therapy (CDT) were enrolled. Seventeen patients consented to receive HBO2 therapy while 8 patients who declined HBO2 therapy participated as controls. Twenty HBO2 treatments were delivered over 3-4 weeks. Each treatment involved breathing 100% facemask O2 at 2.4 atmospheres absolute (ATA) for 2 hours. Patients limb volumes were assessed by optoelectric volumetry at baseline, 8 weeks post-HBO2, 6 months, and 12 months. Compliance with Phase II CDT was assessed at each timepoint with a non-validated questionnaire. Primary Outcome Measure: Percent inter-limb volume discrepancy at 12 months. Results:  Baseline demographics and breast cancer treatment characteristics were similar between HBO2 and control groups excepting radiation treatment. Fifty three percent of HBO2 patients and 12.5% of control patients received 4-field radiation. Baseline inter-limb volume differences were not signifi cantly different between the groups. However, at 12 months the HBO2 group\u2019s mean inter-limb volume difference was signifi cantly less than the control group\u2019s despite inferior CDT compliance (p=0.03). Conclusions:  HBO2 offers promise of lymphedema volume reduction and sustained volume control when delivered within 24 months of radiation therapy. I sure do understand your reluctance to undergo surgery with the LE in your arm. But if you want to consider it, the NLN recently published a couple of helpful articles about surgery in a limb with LE. With some precautions beforehand and careful management following, it can be safe and successful. Anyone who's an NLN member can access them in the LymphLink archives. If you're not, let me know and I'll help you find it. Oprah isn't making any friends among lymphers, is she?! Wish we all just had a chance to talk to her, for a few minutes even. Bet we could convince her to take notice!  Shari, for keeping your hands warm, do you mean those gloves with the fingertips missing? Do you use them around the house too? That's a really good tip -- it's hard to keep hands warm and still try to do anything with them. Barbara too, hugs and prayers! Keep us posted, Binney",

I've tried using my left hand before when I've needed to write something or when I'm working sudokus or crosswords, and it's so frustrating. But having exercises in a workbook somehow makes me feel less stressed about my sloppy efforts. And knowing that I'll be doing some of the same exercises over the course of several days makes me feel relaxed when I mess up. It sure isn't easy, but a workbook is for practice, not for perfection, so this is giving me the room I need to do just that. I'm liking this!

Barbaraellen did the research and discovered that the Lymphedema Framework Project is having a meeting of its Steering Committee and Executive Committee in late August in Florida. The LE Framework Project is putting together a concensus document on best practices for the treatment of lymphedema for the U.S. This will determine standards of LE diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. It will also outline what will be taught about LE in our medical schools. Hopefully it will even create the foundation for a recognized physician specialty in lymphology. We're going to want RIBP to be considered in this document (as well as in med school training), so now is our chance to influence the August discussions of these two committees by letting them know we want RIBP to be a part of the Framework Project Document. So, here's your mission, should you choose to accept it! (Theme music, please, from \"Mission Impossible\"): Send an email to the Framework organization and ask them to add RIBP to the discussion at their Florida meetings in August. Tell them how important it is to you to make the medical community aware of the unique challenges of lymphedema when it's part of RIBP. If you can share your own experience with trying to control LE in the presence of RIBP, or even struggling to get a diagnosis, please do so. We want this to be at the front of their minds as they meet to consider what needs to go into this document. Barbaraellen attended the initial planning meeting for the Framework Project, and she really felt that the needs of those with RIBP were pretty much \"shouted down\" by everyone else's agenda. So even though some of the \"movers and shakers\" of the Framework Project are aware of RIBP, it's really up to us to keep it at the front of their minds.   Here are the names of people you can address your email to: Melanie Schneider Project Development Specialist American Lymphedema Framework Project University of Missouri or Jane Armer, PhD, RN, Director University of Missouri Center for Lymphedema Research, Practice and Health Policy The address to send your email to is:  alfp@missouri.edu Let's get out all the drums and bells and whistles we can muster and make sure we're heard!

Ralpha, when I pull up that page there's a whole list of sites. Did you find one in particular that offered on-line typing lessons? Or do you mean you're ordering a set of lessons? Do keep us posted! I use a FrogPad, which is a one-hand keyboard. It required re-learning toch typing, but it's smooth as butter now and I've been very happy with it. Still, if you could learn to use a regular keyboard one-handed, that'd be a real boost, as it would work on everybody's computer! HELP WITH MEDICAL TRAVEL: The National Lymphedema Network newsletter this month had a news item about the National Patient Travel Center, which offeres one free roundtrip flight per year to patients who have had cancer for distant specialized evaluation, diagnosis or treatment of either cancer or its side effects, including both lymphedema and RIBP. I called them this morning just to check out their services. In short, you could travel to another city to see a LE or RIBP doctor (or even therapist if you don't have one near you) for diagnosis or evaluation. They also offer referral to other patient-travel organizationsfor on-going travel needs for continuing therapy. The process involves calling them to start the process. They need statements from any one of your doctors requesting distant service, and they then make arrangements with either Delta or United to fly you where you need to go. The process takes 5 to 7 working days, so planning two weeks in advance gives them the time they need to complete the arrangements. The number to call is 1-800-296-1217. Sounds good to me, and thought it might be useful to some of you who need better help than you have available close by. A New Year full of only good surprises to each of you! Binney",

Also, I haven't heard of it starting with those symptoms -- women report it as starting with weakness and/or pain in their fingers and hands.

When you sign up there's an option to register as wanting a session on RIBP, and they will provide a mentor if there's enough interest. A chance to meet others with RIBP, share issues and strategies, and get guidance from professionals interested in it. The Patient Summit is planned for September 8 and 9 in San Francisco, co-sponsored by the International Society of Lymphology and the National Lymphedema Network. It's an opportunity for patients to learn more about lymphedema: all the latest in treatments, research, new products. Rub shoulders with lymphologists and lymphedema researchers from around the world, listen to lectures tailored to patient interests, and participate in workshops on a variety of subjects. You'll also be able to visit the Exhibit Hall of lymphedema products--booths set up by all the players in this growing field. See, feel, and experience all the garments, talk to the designers and manufacturers, pick up ideas and share your needs with them as well. Meet up with others from this forum who will be attending, and make new friends with lymphers from all over. More information here: http://www.lymphology2015.com/program/patient_summ... Go for it!

Okay, it appears that a rare but possible site-effect of all the NSAID's is fluid retention (from what I can make out, generally in the legs and feet), caused by fluid leakage from the blood vessels (this is a very rough description, you understand!) Which is not LE and is treated with diuretics. So there's the potential for Ibuprofen to cause extra swelling. If it seems to be doing that you might want to stop using it and see if that helps. Stopping is probably better than taking diuretics, which are hard to regulate with LE because you don't want to wring the water out of your tissues and leave the large protein molecules behind to clog up your arm. Our friend Pat O'Connor (LymphedemaPeople), who has LE in his legs, can't use Ibuprofen at all or his legs swell up. Does that help any? Anything to stop the \"Swelling of the Lymph Nodes following Surgical Removal of the Breast,\" right! (Good grief!) I'll keep looking and report back if I find out anything startling. Be well!

Bomber, when you stopped taking it did you notice a difference in LE control? I recall this being mentioned at the NLN Conference, but it wasn't suggested that it was contraindicated, only that it could have the effect of slowing the lymph system. As to there being an inflammatory component to LE, there certainly is. The presence of too much protein in the tissues sets up an inflammatory reaction that leads to fibrosis and the accumulation of fat beneath the skin. But whether this can be controlled by motrin or not hasn't, to my knowledge, been studied. I believe the Lymphatic Research Foundation has an special interest in this subject, but at this time they're not making any recommendations about a type of anti-inflammatory agent, much less a suggested dosage. And obviously if the motrin slows the lymph system, that's not gonna work for everyone. On the other hand, what confuses me about this is that pain results in more swelling, so you'd think reducing the pain would reduce the swelling. And maybe it does for some of us, despite the effect Pat mentioned. Perhaps it's a balancing act, and some of us fall one way, and some the other. Bottom line: know thyself! (Hmmm. I don't believe that was an original line....) If it makes you swell, stop using it. Ruth, I'm really sorry about your rotten new diagnosis, but delighted that you're on your way to getting it under control. Please let us know how we can help! (((((Hugs!!!))))) Be well! Binney",

Staying out of the hospital can start to seem like a full-time career! There are compression garments available, and some of us use regular camis or bras that give fill coverage for the back and underarm. I use a Sassybax Torso Trim to take care of swelling in front and back just below the axilla, with pockets for prostheses that I sew in myself. Bellisse makes a compression bra, and others use Anita brand items. I hope others will come along to post their choices. I've also used custom made compression vests that fit my chest without prostheses, made by Jobst and Bio-Concepts. Mine had short sleeves that helped manage shoulder swelling, and a front zipper for easy donning. \"Bygrace\" recently purchased ready-made compression garments made in Latin America (I forget where) that look really nice. I'll go look for her post, but in case I can't find it, hopefully she'll come post here. Do get well quick, and please keep us posted. Be well! Binney  (Found it!

You're right, there are other products that can be used for wrapping, and other wrapping patterns as well. And different individuals need special padding, wound dressings or other considerations besides. But the pictures illustrate the standard order and \"look\". There's an initial layer (stockinette) to protect the skin, the gauze for the fingers (if the lower arm is involved), then the padding layer which can be thin foam as illustrated or another soft product. This layer is important to help even the compression and protect sensitive areas (elbows, for instance). Then the layered short-stretch bandages, which must be applied with gradient pressure. There may be many more than illustrated, depending on the size of the arm (both length and diameter) or other special needs of each individual woman. These layers can be wrapped in other patterns too, such as the herringbone pattern.  So basically the pictures just help remind us of the order and expectations of our wrapping. Some of us need the prompting because we're new at it, others because we don't do it every day so we need a \"refresher course\" when we have to do it again after a gap of time. But equally important is for new women to be able to visualize the procedure and the look before they begin therapy. It's a shock otherwise, and it's really difficult to describe in words, so pictures can help protect them from the trauma of that initial therapy session. As for supervision the first time around -- Chloe, how about the first half-a-dozen times! This is definitely a skill that needs to be taught in person by a well-trained LE therapist, and practiced with his/her supervision until it can be done safely and effectively every time -- even in an airport lobby with an audience of gawking fellow-passengers! Thanks for clarifying, and welcome to the boards! Be well, Binney ",

Football players develop LE from chest trauma, and anybody who's involved in a car accident or crush injury is at risk for LE as well (think Haitian survivors of the earthquake -- aaaugh!) And that's just for starters. All of that is \"secondary lymphedema,\" which means LE brought on by something like injury or surgery. There's \"primary lymphedema\" as well, which is caused by being born with a defective lymph system. Swelling can be present at birth, or it can emerge in early adolescence or the middle years. Very nasty surprise. We have trouble getting the risk reduction information and treatment we need, but all these others have a much harder time of it than we do. I recently spoke to the oncology nurses at my cancer center, and they were SURPRISED to learn that the swelling they saw so often after prostate and gynecologic cancers was LE. They thought only breast cancer patients got LE. So these patients are going undiagnosed and untreated, trying to disguise their disfigured legs and feet with loose-legged pants and two sizes of shoes -- when there's treatment available if they only knew it! People with primary LE routinely go through ten or twenty years, and as many doctors, (all the time being told they're just FAT) before they even have a name for their condition. Babies born with it (and their frantic parents) get kicked around from children's center to children's center all over the country until someone finally diagnoses it. So you're right: more survivorship means more and more lymphedema. We bc gals have the \"pink\" awareness platform to start making a difference for all the others, so anything we can do to educate our own doctors and the public is definitely going to help move this forward.  Hmmmm...I do get carried away on this subject.

And since I know no one who has ever had their hand zapped, I don't think I've ever even thought about it. RIBP is caused by radiation damage to the brachial plexus, which is a network of nerves that can be radiated during breast cancer treatment. Seems likely similar damage could be done to the nerves in the hand, but I'm not sure what the symptoms of that might be. Obviously the radiation doctor isn't someone you trust, but do you have a neurologist you can ask about this? It's a perfectly legitimate concern, and well worth researching, so please don't hesitate to ask your doctors about it out of embarrassment. Since you're in the UK, I'd sure see if you can connect with the R.A.G.E. group (Radiation Action Group Exposure)--they might have some answers for you, as their concerns go beyond RIBP and cover all manner of radiation damage.

Do let us know how the Trental/Vitamin E works out for you. It's a promising treatment regimen, especially when started early on. You'll want to get a referral to a qualified lymphedema therapist as soon as possible, since early intervention with swelling is a great way to keep that from progressing. Anyone on your healthcare team can write a referral for evaluation and treatment. Here's how to find a trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified... Please don't apologize for \"going on\" here, as that's what we're all here for. And please do keep us posted. Gentle hugs, Binney ",

What your doctor is probably doing with the tests he's ordering is ruling out other problems that could cause swelling, such as blood clots or (ugh!) new tumors. Happily, the CT scan showed no such problems. If it's lymphedema, the PET scan won't show that either. Neither will an ultrasound, or a doppler. That's because lymphedema is not a pool of fluid that can be seen with these imaging techniques, but an accumulation of fluid in all the teensy spaces between the cells, where it can't be detected. Once he has ruled out the other causes, the next step would be to refer you to a well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist, who will be able to tell you if it's lymphedema by your medical history and a physical exam (s/he has been trained to recognize the unique feel of lymph in the tissues beneath the skin -- my therapist says it feels like marshmellow fluff). Arm lymphedema can also be diagnosed by measurements comparing one arm with the other, but truncal lymphedema can't be measured because...well, because we breathe in and out and keep changing our chest measurement. So, likely no one short of a well-trained lymphedema therapist will be able to give you a definite diagnosis of lymphedema.

Anyhow, I've heard from one of the Medical Advisory Committee (or whatever MAC stands for -- it's been a long day and I forget) and she is appalled that everyone thinks the MAC had anything to do with the post on the NLN Facebook page. She says she didn't even know the NLN had a Facebook page until y'all made the MAC so aware of it (), and that we should let the NLN Board of Directors know that we're unhappy about them not monitoring the Facebook site any better than that. She intends to let them know also, because she's angry about Ms. Stout's position on LE and pain too, and she doesn't want anyone thinking she went along with it. The MAC is made up of busy professionals -- doctors, clinicians, researchers -- who volunteer their time to advise on medical issues, but they were never told about Ms. Stout's letter or even that the NLN had a Facebook page. So, here's a list  of the NLN Board of Director members. The one she mentioned as being responsible for such issues is Dr. Wade Farrell. Aside from Saskia Thiadens, who is the director of the NLN, I don't know any of these people, nor their web addresses, so if anyone else does please let us know how to contact them. Short of that, I'd guess we could address emails to them through the NLN: Wade P. Farrow, MD, CWS, FCCWS Tess Karwoski, RN Dave Lob,    MBA    Max Salas, MBA Saskia R.J. Thiadens, RN For myself, I kind of wonder why there are no patients on any of these boards, so as to perhaps avert disasters such as this one by tapping into the patient point of view. For an organization that purports to speak for patients, our voice seems to be sorta absent. Faith, yes, it is time we heard from bc.org about those LE page revisions they assured us were in the works. Perhaps a PM or two to moderator Melissa would jog that loose.

Clearly none of that has put your mind at rest. Though I'm not inclined to think what you're dealing with is breast cancer, still, if you were my daughter I'd insist on clearer answers, if for no other reason than peace of mind. Imaging could conceivably solve this dilemma. Any chance you could request further clarification? As to your question here, any impingement on either nerves or lymphatics could conceivably cause feelings of heaviness in your arm and hand. Tumor growth is only one of several possibilities, all of them less worrisome than that. Again, if I were you I'd want answers. Is there anyone who can go with you and advocate with you for a more thoroughgoing diagnosis?

      "Content": "Nov 16, 2010 09:28AM - edited Nov 16, 2010 09:31AM by Binney4 Oh, goodness! First, let me say that the NLN international professional conferences happen every two years. I went to the one two years ago (not as a professional -- as a patient in a special NLN program that trains LE advocates in lymph science). Two years ago was the first time pain with LE was even beginning to be acknowledged, and that came about because of patients like us raising a hue and cry about it. Yes, pain can sometimes indicate another underlying condition, and that should be considered, but pain is too often also from the LE -- period. But I mention this because it might help to know that the notion of LE being painful has only very recently been acknowledged by the professionals (lymphologists, researchers, therapists). Nicole Stout is behind the ball on this one. Sometimes words and concepts get in professionals' way, and this may be one instance of that. I've heard therapists argue that it's not the LE that causes the pain, it's the pressure that the swelling puts on the nerves, so it's actually the nerves that are acting up. Well -- hellooooo! The nerves would be all happy again if the LE went away, so I think we might be allowed to say that LE causes pain. We'll have to think about how to approach this with Nicole, but for myself, I'm not too worried about this specific problem, since in the last two years I've seen how the idea that LE is painful has caught on among professionals. Eventually she'll get it. One other item of concern here, though. Nicole Stout is, in fact, a very prominant LE researcher, and she's the LE point person that bc.org has turned to in the past for their \"expert discussions\" on LE. So you'll find her archived here on the information pages. My squawk with her is that in my opinion (humble and unprofessional as it may be) she's wrong in her statements that LE doesn't limit us in what we're able to do -- that we can \"work up to\" whatever we want to do or did before. In my own personal experience that is so not true, and many others here have said the same. I've stood on my head trying to \"work up to\" any number of activities I'd love to be able to do again but, no matter what, they make my arm and chest swell. So I'd say she has a sort of cloudy history of denying our reality. And to make matters worse, if bc.org is really revising their LE info pages like they say they are, this may be the expert they're consulting. So if anyone has any suggestions on how we might intervene here before bc.org comes out with outrageous claims, either about our pain or our unlimited abilities, let's hear it! Together we can make a difference! Binney",

So, hooray for me for remembering it this time while I'm sitting here -- another chemo-brain triumph! Research shows that weight gain, especially weight gained since the bc surgery, is a risk factor for lymphedema development. BUT! On the positive side, losing weight (even 5 or 10 pounds) benefits LE control, so as you lose weight you'll be working toward making this whole thing easier to manage. Yes!

If it's too loose anywhere it's time to replace the sleeve. Six months is, as Bobo says, the usual guideline for replacement if you're wearing it daily, but if you gain or lose weight or have trouble controlling the swelling you may need to replace them sooner. New measurements should be taken each time so you're sure of a good fit. There are some ways to help make compression garments last well. Washing them every couple of days with a gentle soap can help them last. Avoid using a dryer. Don't wring them out. Just press the water out gently, then roll them in a towel (without wringing), then and lay them out to dry. Using a skin lotion that doesn't contain lanolin can help too, as lanolin is hard on the stretch fabric. The National Lymphedema Network (www.lymphnet.org) has a new program for providing garments for those who can't afford them, but it's so new the guidelines aren't clear yet! If you're on Medicare there's an advocate who will help you appeal for payment for your garments. He usually wins, but it's a long process. If you'd like his name and email address just ask and I'll be happy to give it to you. He is actively looking for Medicare patients willing to appeal, so that the rulings in his favor can be used as a precedent for changing the Medicare provisions. Mackie, at the moment there is no research showing that bioflavonoids help lymphedema, and I don't know of any in progress either. If you know of some, please share them with us. Thanks! Kaymc, redness is usually not a symptom of lymphedema, but swelling is. If the swelling is recent and wasn't there immediately following the surgery it may well be lymphedema. The medical professional who can evaluate that and tell you for sure would be a well-trained lymphedema therapist. You can get a referral for an evaluation with one from any member of your medical team. Here's a web site for finding a well-qualified therapist near you. Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links: www.mylymphedema.com  Again, welcome! I'm really glad you've all joined us! The Expert discussion tonight was really helpful, yes?

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2010 02:11PM Binney4 wrote: Ruthbru, the guidelines for lymphedema risk reduction are not always well understood by our doctors, for the reasons Kira mentions. (What Dr. Rockson found in his survey was that many med schools don't teach it at all, and the average amount of time spent teaching about the lymph system across all the med schools, is a total of 15 MINUTES during the doctor's four-year medical training. So, no help there.) The issue of how much to lift, and how long to wait before lifting, is a lot more complicated than it sounds. There are no studies that show any guaranteed safe (or unsafe) limits or levels, and we're all different in the degree of fitness we started out with, the adequacy or inadequacy or our individual lymph systems, and a whole host of other risk factors (both known and unknown). So instead of mentioning specific weights or times, the guidelines have to do with building up your strength VERY gradually -- much more slowly than you might have before your bc treatment. You should pay close attention to your arm, stopping at once if it feels strained, achy, heavy, tingly, or just \"weird.\" Stop, rest the arm, elevate it, drink plenty of water, breathe deeply from your abdomen -- and next time go even more gradually. Here are a couple of web sites with risk reduction information: http://www.lymphnet.org   (See their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Notself, hello! Checking your arms is a good idea, but early swelling is almost always missed by eye-balling. A visit to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for baseline arm measurements and help in learning to measure your own arms accurately might give you better protection. Also s/he would be able to teach you a gentle lymph self-massage, because direction, order, hand position and pressure are all important. It is not something anyone can learn without one-on-one direction and training. You mention aerobic exercise, which of course is great for any number of reasons. But depending on the exercise it can also send extra lymph fluid to the muscles and overwhelm an already-compromised lymph system. So careful attention to your arm and upper quadrant while exercising is very important. You might want to consider well-fitted compression garments for any exercise, whether aerobic or weight-bearing. A therapist can assist you with that as well. Here's a page for finding a well-trained therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Eight nodes is actually quite a lot, Notself. Many women here have lymphedema with only SNB or even with prophylactic mastectomy. (I have bilateral lymphedema with one node removed on the affected side and  a prophylactic mastectomy on the other.) So, you're really wise to be thinking about your risk and simple ways to reduce and control it. Just wish our doctors would be our advocates in all of this! Since they so often aren't, though, do consider copying off helpful material and sharing it with them at your next visit -- we need to do all we can to protect the BC Sisters coming along behind us!

We often have women who are shocked enough to contemplate changing doctors. It's everyone's own choice, of course, but the truth is that even some of the very best surgeons and oncologists don't know anything much about lymphedema, and few if any actually assume oversight of it even if they diagnose it and refer to a therapist. So changing doctors because of their lack of knowledge of lymphedema could be a very serious mistake. Instead, do consider educating your doctors and their nurses. If you're not defensive, and if you come armed with information they can use, from sources they respect, you will help not only yourself but also all the bc Sisters who come along behind you. Here are some resources you can use: The Position Papers of the National Lymphedema Network on Risk Reduction, Exercise, Air Travel, Treatment, and Therapists.

Like you, I had a prophylactic mastectomy on the other side, no nodes removed from the axilla, and I developed lymphedema on that side also. Dawn and Kira really covered the subject, but I'll just chime in with a couple of thoughts. Dawn's description is the same as my MLD routine: above the scars I massage toward my neck, below the scars and on my side and back I massage toward the groin. Your therapist should be able to help you make those changes to the MLD. From your description it does seem likely that you have some lymphedema on the prophylactic side. The redness that is still hanging on there may be an inflammatory reaction to the stagnant lymph fluid, and swelling is hard to measure, even with your eyes, after a surgery that changes the whole area so drastically. After surgery the scars can block the lymph flow, and delicate lymph vessels have been cut and may be unable to repair themselves with so much scar tissue and the oedema that resulted from the surgery. Are you using arm protection (sleeves and gloves or gauntlets) on BOTH arms? After bilateral mastectomies both arms are at risk, so wearing well-fitting compression garments when exercising or traveling or doing anything strenuous may help keep them in control. Neither arm should be used routinely for blood draws, blood pressure, or IVs. (Blood draws and IVs can be done in the foot, and blood pressure on the leg. It sounds worse than it is!) Here's an information page about chest lymphedema (it's called \"truncal\" lymphedema), with some ideas near the bottom of the page for bras, camis, binders and shapers that can help: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm In answer to your question about swelling on both sides of your chest, I have to say that it's no harder to treat both sides of my chest than it is to treat just one. The MLD takes longer, of course, but anything you wear for compression on one side works for both sides, whether you have lymphedema or not, so there's no extra compression garment problems. Nitocris, your English is wonderful, but if I've said anything that you don't understand please tell me and I'll try to explain it better. We're all here to help each other, so do let us know how you're doing, and how we can help. Gentle hugs, Binney",

First, lymphedema might just as well result from blockage of lymph flow due to the cancer in the axilla, so it's a toss-up. Certainly relieving the discomfort is a serious consideration as well, since pain draws more lymph fluid to an already compromised area. I'd like to suggest an evaluation by a well-trained lymphedema therapist. Since there's currently no state mandated LE certification requirements you'll need to be sure that any LE therapist you see has had at least 135 hours of specifically LE training and preferably at least a year's experience treating LE. If the therapist is also a PT (rather than an OT) s/he should be able to help with the frozen shoulder as well. Here are two sites for finding therapists with those qualifications in your area: www.mylymphedema.com (click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links) www.clt-lana.org (click on \"LANA-certified therapists\" on the left-hand side of the page) A LE therapist should take baseline arm measurements, give you plenty of prevention and coping tips, perhaps fit your wife for a sleeve and glove that may help relieve pain and/or teach her a simple LE massage to ease discomfort. There has in the past been some controversy over lymphedema therapy in the presence of active cancer, so I'll refer you to this thread from the LE board here where the subject was recently discussed: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64/topic/708977?page=1#idx_14 (If that link doesn't work try copying it into your browser, and if that doesn't work we'll try something else).

I agree with KC and Kira that your next step needs to be either a heart-to-heart with your present therapist to discuss implementing the NLN treatment guidelines, or finding a new therapist. Treating it promptly and well makes a big difference in ease of management on-going. If you haven't yet ordered those new garments, you might want to hold off until you get proper treatment and all swelling is reduced -- or until you have a clear understanding with your therapist about why she's skipping the therapy in your case since there's already swelling present. Garments do not reduce swelling, they only contain it, and you want it gone. Here's how to find the options for therapists near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Yikes on the burn! Glad it's not looking angry at present, but do keep an eye on it and get help immediately if you notice any of the symptoms of infection. Keep us posted! Here's a page on lymphedema emergencies: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm As for exercise, the weight-lifting study has been seriously misinterpreted nearly everywhere. Better infomation is available by Kathryn Schmitz, the study author, at the National Lymphedema Network website. You'll find her warnings there regarding misinformation about her weight-lifting study. Best exercise for lymphedema remains water exercise, but any exercise at all needs to be started very slowly, and only once the swelling has been reduced and controlled, and while wearing well-fitting compression garments. Weight-lifting is NOT a cure or a preventative, but certainly exercise is an important part of both therapy and care for lymphedema. So, how were the cookies? Yum! Hug your little guy for us.

However, there are a couple of factors that change that. The first is the lymphedema stage. For instance, it's now considered acceptable to treat pre-clinical (or Stage 0, with early symptoms of discomfort and occasional mild swelling) with nothing more than a well-fitted sleeve and glove or gauntlet to be used for exercise and travel; and early Stage 1 (with more consistent mild swelling) is sometimes managed with just a few sessions with the therapist. The second consideration of how rigorously to treat is what's actually possible for an individual patient. If their insurance doesn't cover PT or (like you) their treatment exhaustion makes it unthinkable, there are modifications that can be made to suit your own situation. During your first visit, be up-front about the things you've mentioned here and work with your therapist to set up a schedule that works FOR YOU. That may mean, for instance, taking remedial measures now and putting off \"the full whammy\" until you're up for it, or making an effort to teach you self-care quickly so you can handle Manual Lymph Drainage (massage) and (if necessary) wrapping at home yourself. A lot of LE care is up to us, so speak up and expect some flexibility that fits your own needs. Let us know how it goes! Gentle hugs, Binney",

On the other hand, I don't think I'd put insect repellent on my skin under my garment, for fear it'd damage my skin . Unless perhaps it was that Avon Skin-So-Soft or whatever it's called. So maybe a good lotion-plus-sunscreen on your skin, let it sit a few minutes before donning the garments, and then a zap of insect repellent over the garment. Does that sound about right?

As for next time around on the mammo, a breast MRI is a possible alternative, but insurance companies don't like paying for them. So you might want to start now to request that for next time, since you'll likely have to appeal it. Get whichever doctor on your team is most willing to listen to you and ask him/her to write you a letter of medical necessity for an MRI as an alternative to a mammo. Failing that, if a mammo turns out to be your only option, be sure your swelling is as reduced as it can be immediately before the mammo (see your LE therapist for help with that), and expect to do more frequent self-MLD afterward. (If you haven't learned self-MLD, see your therapist and insist on being taught--really important \"tool\" for self-management!) Stay especially well-hydrated in the days before and after, and plan to rest afterward as well. You may find that now that you're treating it, it will be fairly easy to get everything back in control, even with the stress of a mammo. Still, obviously best avoided! Do please keep us posted.

Kira, I didn't hear the comment you mentioned about re-measuring to see if you still needed to use compression, but I'm assuming it referred to re-measuring and reassessing often, not just that if your arm is a normal size, then you don't need compression. I can sometimes go without compression on my left arm and hand (as long as I watch what I'm doing). But with my right, even though it's usually not measurably swollen, I can't go without compression at all or it swells again. About the \"waffle\" look (love the term, Jane!), I just wanted to add that the directional stitching on custom night garments is designed to match your own massage direction. Because of bilateral surgeries, for instance, my vest for truncal LE is different from one designed for someone with a single mastectomy. BUT, if you're using the Swell Spots, which also have directional stitching, you MUST be careful to place them so that the stitched seams go in the direction you want the fluid to flow. They're not just padding, they're for moving fluid in a certain direction. For those of you with more scientific minds than mine, the directional stitching (and consequently the amazing patterns we find on our bodies in the morning ) was invented by an engineer according to the Law of LaPlace, which has to do with fluid dynamics and the interior pressure of fluids against the walls of cylinders (that is, the pressure of lymph fluid inside our lymph veins). Exactly WHAT it has to do with that is well beyond me , but I'll bet some of you will get it, so I pass that bit of trivia on. If nothing else you can boggle the guests at your next dinner party by bringing it up during dessert, thereby distracting them from the gravy you slopped all over your compression glove... Isn't LE fascinating? No, huh? Binney ",

On the other hand, there are similar off-the-shelf garments (one by Solaris is called \"Caresia\") that you can use under the short stretch bandages instead of stockinette, foam, etc. It might help in your situation, but you'd need a good therapist to help you evaluate if that's best for YOU.

It's not invasive and doesn't involve any more drugs or surgeries. And doggone if the gentle massage involved isn't plain lovely! And what's more you've caught it early and can hope for a quick and probably complete response from treatment. Yes! So Tina's absolutely right: you can avoid panic on this one. You'll want a well-trained LE therapist (that'd be someone with at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her OT or PT certification, and at least a year's experience -- preferably supervised -- treating LE. Call and ask before you go.) To find one near you, check out the links at the Therapist Locator, www.mylymphedema.com. Yet more great information about LE treatment at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org If it turns out to be LE, that's a steep learning curve, but you can do this, and you come out the other end with all the tools you need to manage this on your own, so you get your life back. Hang in there! Any way I can help? And let me know what you discover, Binney ",

She prides herself on doing things differently and thinks it's ridiculous to be so gentle with such a troublesome condition. But her patients do very poorly, and the better therapists in our area often end up having to undo the damage. I agree with Kira: the proof is in the results. It's great that you had that first session as a comparison. Can you get the first therapist back again? When you take off the bandages and get quick return of swelling it could be from several causes. Most likely is that the bandages were too tight, and the swelling you get when you remove the wraps is rebound swelling -- your body's over-reaction to the too-tight compression. Another cause could be uneven wrapping, with an area of tighter compression or more layers of wraps higher up your arm, which is the opposite of what it should be. When that happens it can create areas of swelling below the constriction that may not appear until the wraps are off. A third reason could be that you just happen to be a person whose LE needs constant compression, but since that's pretty rare it's more likely a wrapping problem. Good for you for raising these questions! Don't be afraid to insist on answers from the therapist team that's treating you. Let us know what you discover. Gentle hugs, Binney",

So sorry for the official verdict, but I gotta tell you that with therapy and learning you will feel so much better, and so much more in control. Life-altering, yes -- but not life-destroying. It gets better! You're right that fitting a Michelin-Man arm into clothes can be a challenge. T-shirts work best for me, but I have a couple of shirts with wider sleeves (short sleeves) that work too. Jackets and coats are more of a challenge, though for short periods you can just leave your arm out of the sleeve (like you would if it were in a cast). Your DH's hoody sounds like a winner (assuming it's not hot where you live!) Night wear is also a consideration. You could cut a sleeve off an old pj top or just wear a t-shirt. For me, oddly enough, the nightwear was the toughest to deal with -- you just want to go to bed and be comfy and cozy and leave all these adjustments for the waking hours, y'know?  Wrapping experience with horses should definitely put you ahead of the game. This requires a careful compression gradient (more at the hand to less at the axilla), but if you're already skilled at using wrapping that will all come easily enough. What's more of a challenge, of course, is that you have only one hand to do this with. But this, too, is only a matter of practice. (Well, and patience!) Having your husband learn along with you will be a huge help and support, and it allows him to ask the questions he needs to to understand what lymphedema is all about. And he'll be able to help with the areas you can't reach to massage yourself, too. Cheers for him! Stay in touch with us, Kane, and let us know how it's going. Good for you for trying to stay up, but please do give yourself room to be sad or mad or frustrated too. We've all been there. So glad you could get an appointment so promptly!

Is she wrapping your arm in bandages after the massage sessions? That's a very important part of reducing the swelling, and learning to do it yourself will give you the ability to deal with any future flare-ups and not have to keep that (expensive!) therapist in your pocket.

I recently discovered that if I pay for my custom garments out-of-pocket and buy them from the fitter, they are three times as expensive as if I buy them directly from the manufacturer. So if I were going 50/50 with my insurance company, I'd be better off buying them myself than using my insurance benefits. We need to ask questions. Jaysmom, custom garments are not a rip-off for me, because I can't wear most fabrics and the compression has to be low or I'm in trouble. Custom is a serious consideration also for any stubborn areas of swelling or places that flare frequently. Women with arms that are longer, thinner, or in other ways somewhat off the \"norm\" are not well served by off-the-shelf garments either. The technology involved in making garments (especially gloves) to fit the multiple complex planes of our hands, and still provide the proper gradient compression, is no small thing. (Which is why it's important to deal with both a fitter and a manufacturer who will care about making the fit right -- and also why it's frequently necessary to try, try again.) So it's understandable why custom garments are so much more expensive than off-the-shelf.   On the other hand, the mark-ups created by both the middlemen and the insurance industry are definitely way out of bounds, whether custom or off-the-shelf. But getting a proper fit is not a do-it-yourself project, so at least some of the time the help of therapists and fitters is essential (assuming, of course, that they know what they're doing!) The search for a competent fitter can be as taxing as the search for a great LE therapist. <sigh!>  Any change in arm measurements or weight, or any general dissatisfaction with the fit of the current garments calls for a re-measure. There's a product called \"It Stays\" which is a liquid adhesive you can apply to keep a sleeve top in place, because sometimes they can slip. But if it's a matter of the fit being off (either because of fabric fatique or reduction of your arm measurement), then it's time for a new garment. Lexislove, do you know how to wrap your arm? If not, you might want to consider spending your limited funds on a therapist who can teach and supervise you as you gain that skill. Wrapping is cheaper and more effective than garments, and it can be used whenever problems develop with garments. Just a very important tool to have in our LE toolbox! Be well! Binney",

The post-breast cancer wisdom is to use only electric shavers, due to the risk of nicking yourself with a razor and provoking lymphedema. But like Stressin', some of us have found the electric shaver burn and pinching just as irritating to the skin, and just as risky. So some use razors, either new or freshly sterilized in the dishwasher, but never dull or dirty ones. And we all keep a tube of topical antibiotic handy for nicks or scrapes. Personally, I've found the Conair Silky Soft electric shaver to be...well, silky soft, and safe for skin that's at risk. Helen, if you're wanting to mix up a batch of cornstarch/baking powder, you might want to put it into the toe of a clean cotton sock, close the top with a rubber band, and just pat it on where you want it. Saves on those messy spills that make the floor so slippery. You can keep the powder-filled sock in a pretty bowl on your dresser, where you can use it when you think of it. Somebody's going to come along and recommend Crystal Stick-type deodorant. I do use it, even now several years after rads. But being a klutz I sometimes drop or knock it onto the floor, where little shards break off, leaving sharp edges on the stick. These can be smoothed carefully with a piece of pumice, but do be careful not to use it when it's sharp, as you run the risk of nicking your skin. Just for easy reference, since we are ALL at risk for lymphedema (yes, even with SNB - in fact, even with a prophylactic mastectomy) here's the link for the National Lymphedema Network, where you'll find expert Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel for all of us who are at risk for developing lymphedema.

I've since heard from some therapists that Milk of Magnesia applied to the skin and allowed to dry first will help prevent irritation. Haven't tried it. As LindaLou says, you need to try a small application first, but do make sure the area you try it on is not in your affected quadrant (arm, shoulder, back or chest on the operated side), as you don't want to irritate the skin there. Application to your back takes a helper, so if your back area is a problem take a friend along to learn with you.

Pain is fairly common with truncal LE, doesn't usually respond well to pain meds, and can shift around from place to place and be hard to pin down. It's great that your doctor is acting so quickly on it. Treatment, which involves Manual Lymph Drainage and some kind of compression (bra, cami, sport shirt), eases both the swelling and the pain, and it reduces your risk of serious infection.

It's certainly possible to develop lymphedema when tumor growth impinges on the lymphatics and blocks flow, before any treatment is started. But it does seem to be rare. When a tumor is blocking lymph flow and it can't be removed or reduced (by surgery, chemo and/or rads) it may not be possible to reduce the swelling with Manual Lymph Drainage or simple compression. In that case good tissue support from well-fitted day and night compression garments can really make a difference in providing both comfort and maximum use of the hand and arm. Be well!

You would want to make sure any swelling was as well controlled as possible (gentle Manual Lymph Drainage massage and gentle compression). Then the day of the mammo (and the day before as well) you'd want to stay really well hydrated (NO caffeine) and do some deep abdominal breathing from time to time--especially while you're waiting for the mammo (don't take so many deep breathes that you make yourself dizzy!)

You definitely need wrapping as a tool you can use! Artiflex probably isn't as effective as thin foam, and your therapist would need to figure out where to put it. An experienced therapist can cut a foam piece to fit your needs and show you how to use it. Or, depending on the location, a Swell Spot or chip bag (same thing, only a chip bag is homemade) can really help ease unwanted pressure and pain. Worth a try, so do ask your therapist for help figuring it out. Be well! Binney",

Lymphedema gets to feeling like a mind game, partly because the early symptoms do seem to come and go, but mostly because our health-care providers take it so lightly. It's not a small thing, either medically or emotionally. But it's not something our docs treat, either, since there's no surgery or drugs involved, so they don't always know much about it. Shoot, most of the time they don't! The professional you need to see is a well-trained LE therapist. Earlier's better than later, because neglected, it progresses. That makes it harder to get control, longer therapy, more fuss.  The genetic thing has been suspected for a long time, but there's a recent study done in the UK that found that women who develop LE have lymph systems that are already working at top capacity, so surgery alone can trigger it, nodes or no nodes. We can't identify those women beforehand yet, so it's only an interesting discovery, not anything especially helpful. Except that maybe it explains this unfortunate link between you and your aunt. By the way, I've read conflicting studies on age as it relates to LE development. One says older age increases the risk, the other that young age is a risk. Maybe the conflict has to do with the younger ones having longer to develop LE, since the risk continues for life. Sigh! MOTC, I know you're swamped with the bat mitzvah, but your health is precious -- you're precious. You don't want progression, and you sure as heck don't want infection either (in tandem with LE, that can put you in the hospital on IV antibiotics for a few days or more). Your call, of course, but do think about getting help -- it could save you a lot of grief. Hope the plans are going well! Big hugs, Binney",

There could be several possible causes for this, and your doctor definitely needs to decide how to proceed. Some of them are emergencies, so if the swelling you're describing is new today or the last couple of days, please call your doctor right away and get his/her opinion on whether you need to be seen immediately. Since you posted this on the lymphedema board, there are a couple of lymphedema-related situations that can cause swelling in both arms and legs. If you have a port placed on your left side it's possible (but rare) for the port to compress the large lymphatic vessel called the thoracic duct, which can result in swelling of the left arm and both legs. It would not involve the right arm, which is drained by a different duct, and it usually disappears when the port is removed or adjusted. The second possibility is that bc surgery can (again in very rare instances) act as a trigger for primary lymphedema (that means lymphedema caused by a congenital weakness in the lymph system). In that case, all four limbs can be included, and the trunk can be involved as well. Such trama-triggered primary lymphedema is almost always a complete surprise (and not at all a nice one!) I do know women this has happened to, but none who had it happen this soon after treatment (I don't know of any reason why it couldn't happen this soon, but I've never run across that myself).  Since both those instances are quite rare, and there are other possible explanations, I'd suggest you check in with your doctors today and see if they're okay with waiting until after the weekend to diagnose it. You must be so stressed over this, and especially over not finding others here who have experienced it. Please know we're here for you. Do let us know what you discover, and if there's anything we can do to help. Real gentle hugs, Binney",

      "Content": "Sep 16, 2008 05:10PM - edited Sep 16, 2008 05:12PM by Binney4 Hi, Doe, I have LE in my arms and hands and both sides of my chest, back and sides. It was Stage II by the time I got a decent therapist. I had only a prophylactic mastectomy on my right side, where it started. The chest LE is painful whenever it swells, but when the swelling's controlled it's livable. On the left I had both a mastectomy with a single node removed and rads (due to the tumor being close to the chest wall. I have had fibrosis, but at the moment everything's soft and not stiff. I've had it since June of 2004, and I only had a Therapy Intensive once, but I see my therapist a couple of times a year for remeasuring and asking a zillion questions. She's a jewel! Blast me with a list of things you can still do without suffering because of it! Doe, I've been thinking about this question ever since you posted it. It's a really compelling one, because there are a number of things I can no longer do. Handstands, for one. And crocheting for hours at a time. Typing too -- a couple of years ago I bought a left-hand-only keyboard (called a FrogPad) and relearned key-boarding, so I'm back up to my former speed. I can remember the frustration and rage I felt with all these limitations right at first, but I no longer feel that way. There are a couple of reasons why I don't. For one, I'm actually proud of the creativity that I've managed in finding ways around the problems. The FrogPad is a great little thing, tiny but with full-sized keys and all the functions of a full-sized keyboard, and I'm tickled that I can use it well. I've gotten back into sewing in lieu of crocheting (though I use a rotary blade instead of a shears on most everything). Not everyone would value those things, but I've always enjoyed creative problem-solving, so it works for me. After breast cancer, we're all at risk for LE. The women who are trying to prevent it actually have more worrisome restrictions on their lives than I do. I don't have to worry about what I might do that will trigger it, I don't have nearly as much problem arguing with medical folks about using my arms (not that I don't have to watch them like a hawk, but they don't try to tell me LE isn't going to happen!) And when I want to try something that might make me swell, I can go ahead and do it. Sometimes there's no swelling, so I know that's a GO. And if there is swelling I know exactly how to get it back into control. So I'm free to choose to do things I wouldn't risk if I were trying to avoid LE in the first place. And finally, I had a funny experience watching the gymnastics at this year's Olympics. I was enjoying Nastia's incredible performance on the uneven parallel bars, all that swinging from her arms, and felt a pang I'd never felt before, a sudden realization that \"now I'll never be a teen-aged gymnastics star\"! Took my breath away for a moment -- and then I absolutely cracked up. I'm several decades past any such aspiration, but guess I'd never come to grips with that until I had that completely nutty thought. Poor me! No gymnastics! My life is ruined! (I do remember feeling something similar after my mastectomies -- I'd never be able to wear the super-tight, low-cut styles that I've never wanted to wear in my entire life, and I actually had a few moments of grieving over that. ) While the losses we incur from LE are very real -- and poorly understood by those who treat us -- in the end they're more like directional signs than red lights. It's not that the bridge back to our lives has been washed away and we'll never get back again, but that the route we're traveling is no longer as straight as we thought it was. We'll still get where we're going (well, maybe not to the Olympic gymnastics team, but it's not the LE that's holding me back from that!), but we'll see a lot more, experience more, understand more, and have a whole lot better idea of the lay of the land. So to answer your question, I can still do whatever I want to do. Everything. I'm not missing out on a thing. My Olympic aspirations aside, anything is possible. Soooo, what'd'you want to do? Go for it! Binney",

I always feel that LE should exempt us from all other problems, but sure enough, it doesn't seem to work that way. The knee walker is a great help (and my son thought it was so much fun he was jealous and begged us to rent one for him to play with -- not!), but it doesn't work for things like knee replacements or anything higher than the calf. There's also a kind of \"crutch\" that you can bind to your bent knee and walk on -- kind of like a single stilt that you kneel on with the one knee. It gives you a lot of mobility, but again it only works for lower-leg injuries. Coming out of my (purple!) cast, my leg was pale, wasted and weak, but it sure did take the opportunity to swell once it got loose. So I did a LE compression wrap on it for a couple of weeks with some of my Artiflex and short-stretch bandages, and that took care of both the swelling and the pain. The ortho was amazed and called in his assistant to see how rapidly it had healed -- but when I told him about the LE wrapping his eyes glazed over and he lost all interest.  Wha'?! I did try crutches, but even with careful fitting and instruction about how to use them, my arms swelled and my chest immediately hurt. They said if you do it right you don't put pressure on your axilla (that was a surprise to me!), but just the weight on my hands caused swelling, so that was a no-go. Until I got the knee walker I was  stuck with a wheelchair, which in the house is like steering an ocean liner through an irrigation canal. Along these same lines, a few years back we had a Swell Sister, \"Trixiegram,\" who fell and tore her rotator cuff on her good arm, so that was the end of her being able to wrap or do self-MLD on her LE arm, or even pull her garments on. She ended up with a nightsleeve with a zipper for easier donning, and a Flexitouch pump to use daily for MLD. Just a nightmare, but she figured out what had to be done and got on with it. I sure will be interested to hear what others have to share here. Be well! Binney",

After traveling to a higher altitude (wrapped, or with day or night garments) keep them on for a few hours (or until bedtime, if they're your day garments). One problem with travel is the unusual activities that often presents--lugging suitcases, new activities or, especially at a family reunion, hefting toddlers. �So be watchful for things like that.

Lymph nodes can swell for any number of benign reasons -- infection of some kind is one possibility. But done correctly, MLD is more likely to reduce infection risk than cause it. It's hard to get MLD pressure right, partly because we're so earnest about it. It just seems as though more pressure is better for moving the stupid lymph fluid along. But in fact, the lymph vessels are delicate and they lie just below the skin, so too much pressure smushes them instead of opening them up the way we hope to do. The right amount of pressure is just what you'd use to pet a kitten -- not even a full-grown cat. Think kitten, and think slooooooow. As Kira's therapist famously says, the lymph system is slow and stupid. Kitten-petting gentle and stupid-slow is what's called for. Sometimes it's easier if you turn the lights down, light a sweet-smelling candle and play some slow mood music while you do MLD. Make it a home spa treatment! Let us know what the doc has to say.

Here's information on finding a therapist who's qualified: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And yes, overworking your arm could certainly contribute to developing lymphedema. But seeing a therapist and having her help you with compression garments, exercises, and gentle massage will allow you to get back gradually to an active job. The hard, hot, swollen breast on the non-operated side is not likely to be lymphedema unless you've had radiation to that quadrant of your body. A port placement might also cause lymphedema, though that alone would be a very small risk. But those are symptoms of cellulitis, which can be either sudden and active or \"smoldering\" for a while before taking off. So if you or your doctors suspect infection there for any reason (a port, perhaps?) you'll want to get treatment quickly. Tamantha, I hope the lortab is staying ahead of the pain for you and allowing you some healing rest and sleep.

I know this isn't good news, but you really need to do the therapy intensive that your therapist recommended. It's not optional, especially considering how far out of control the stupid LE has gotten. I do get it about your work schedule, but this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed right away in order to get the best and quickest results--and especially to avoid your very real risk of serious infection that goes along with untreated LE. Please do consider this, because you're well worth taking the time to get this under control, and now's the time to do it. Definitely before your surgery, because uncontrolled LE will increase your post-surgical infection risk and slow your recovery time. The lymph system is part of your immune system, and it affects your entire body, so gaining control now will definitely help normalize your strength and healing, which will enable you to deal with the stresses and job and family responsibilities. Please take care of YOU! No pump is a substitute for therapy, but it is a substitute for self-MLD in the \"maintenance stage\" (once professional therapy has ended). If at a later date you choose to use a pump for part of your self-care, node clearing before use is standard, though a complete self-MLD is generally not needed. (Kicks, the \"pump guys\" are not authorized to offer medical advice so can only refer us to our therapists for suggestions about pump usage, but your therapist should be weighing in on node clearing before pump use. You might want to have that discussion, as it can avoid some problems over time.) I just completed a therapy intensive for new lower leg LE, a result of the fact that the lymphatics are indeed a body-wide system, so I'm busy trying to fit leg care into my LE routine, and make sense of the new MLD directions and order. Fortunately what's good for arm/truncal LE is also good for leg LE, but there's extra MLD to be done daily, and things like gravity to contend with--ugh! Hugz, my intense empathy for the disappointment of having to struggle with new truncal swelling and to get the stupid arm LE back into control. You can do this! Hang tough, Binney",

The reason is that even that kitten-petting-gentle massage can compromise the skin, which becomes tender and fragile during treatment. If an arm is affected by lymphedema, then some therapists will continue to treat the arm only (though that is not especially effective) and wait until rads is over and the skin well healed before doing anything else. Any massage in the radiation field that was firm enough to break up scars or fibrosis would definitely have to wait. Waiting to heal is so hard! And there's no way around it that I've found. Just keep reminding yourself that rads DOES end, and then you can begin to take back some control of your life. Very gentle hugs, Binney",

If I go to the grocery-store clinics they have a form you have to fill out that asks about mastectomy -- they won't do it in an arm where nodes were removed. The form says if you've had two mastectomies they won't give you the shot and you have to see your own doctor. But I've had good luck sneaking around the intake person and talking directly to the nurse doing the shots. I hold out my sleeved arms, tell them it's LE and ask if they'll do my thigh instead. So far they've always agreed. As to the questions on the form, I just let the nurse fill that part out any way she wants. This year the nurse looked at my arms, scowled, and said, \"Only if you're wearing shorts -- we're not stripping here!\"   Yes, well...I was definitely wearing shorts! Stay well! Binney",

I believe it's made by Tactile Systems. There's another sequential pump made by BioCompression that I think has the same kind of features. I hope some of the gals will be along soon to share their experiences with you. Pumps are usually covered by insurance, even when therapy and compression garments aren't, because until a decade or so ago MLD therapy wasn't much available in this country, so that was standard treatment, and insurance has never caught up. A pump is not usually necessary, though it's really helpful for people who for one reason or another are not able to do the MLD themselves. Be sure your therapist teaches you to do self MLD effectively, as well as self-bandaging. Those are more portable and adjustable \"tools\" to use in controlling LE. If you get a pump, you still must do adequate clearing of nodes so that the pump doesn't cause fluid to back up into your shoulder or chest, and always use it with the supervision of a well-trained LE therapist. It doesn't sound like your therapist is in this category, but there are some therapists who use a pump to cut down on the time they must spend with their patients. In that case, it's a shortcut you may want to avoid, as you deserve the hands-on attention which is the only way an experienced therapist can stay aware of possible problem areas. Okay, all you pump users, let's hear from you! God bless you, too, Chris, Binney ",

So that may well be adequate. On the other hand, if you're traveling or otherwise out of range of your therapist and you develop problems, you'd be a lot more comfortable knowing how to care for yourself, and wrapping would be a great option to have. (But then maybe I'm a little over-sensitive to these things because I ended up with a very swollen hand on a trip to Sitka, Alaska, where no help was available. ) If she doesn't mind teaching you, and you don't mind the effort of learning, maybe both of you would be relieved to know you had the skill to take care of this yourself. If you never need it, so much the better! Be sure you get a glove with your sleeve, yes? Keeps the fluid from getting trapped in your hand. Hope the other pump users come along soon.

When you start back to any kind of exercise you want to begin veeeeery slowly. If it's tennis you're after, start with just the arm, working up to just the racket (no balls), and go from there, over time. If you experience any achiness, heaviness, or just a \"strange\" feeling in your arm, stop at once and elevate your arm and rest. You can try again the next day, stopping before that point, and continue to work up more gradually. Stay well hydrated, as it helps move lymph fluid. There is no \"safe\" amount of time after treatment -- the lymphedema risk remains for life. An all-clear from your surgeon or onc only means in terms of incision healing or fatigue. It's a rare doctor who knows enough about lymphedema risk to advise patients on that score. Which is why a well-trained lymphedema therapist is the go-to person for the kind of information you're looking for. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Fifteen nodes out does increase your statistical odds, but even one node is enough to result in lymphedema in some women (me, for one!)

This is a difficult and scary time, but a special time too. This time you're able to really share the cancer battle with her, and you may find some of your roles reversed. My kids were so precious and helpful to me throughout my treatments, caring for me actively in ways I'd always cared for them. It's a privilege, I think, and I hope you'll find the fierce joy in it as the two of you stand together in new ways. The point you're at now is one of the hardest. Before long your mom will start treatment, which at least helps you know that you're doing something about it. In the meantime, please just forgive your dad and put him aside. Anger drains all the creative energy you need to draw close to your mom and tune into her needs. And it can't change the present realities in the least (except to make them even more unbearable for you). Direct that anger instead toward the real enemy: breast cancer. Put all the passion you can muster into your prayers for strength and healing. As to the complications of age and other medications and conditions, I suspect that most of us are in that same category -- cancer in young women is considered to be the exception. With caring doctors we manage to do well. You both will too. I'll be praying for you both, with joy. Take your faith firmly in hand, IL, and go for it! Be well! Binney ",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2016 03:42PM - edited Feb 28, 2016 03:43PM by Binney4 vshowe, does your PT have training in fitting a Circaid Reduction Kit? If so, you sound like the perfect candidate for one. It does make the daily wrapping much quicker, and the therapists I've talked to about it say it works about the same. I don't think it will deal with fingers, though, so those may need to wrapped separately. Once reduction has been stabilized (by whatever means), a night garment like Kicks described is a life-saver for ease of night use. Doesn't work as well as wrapping for everyone, but it sure does work for me. And I, like Kicks, have to be very careful not to wrap too tightly or get garments with too high a compression factor, or I swell. That said, it's still important to learn to wrap yourself, and to continue to practice that skill monthly, because it's a great DIY tool to have in case of a flare. If your therapist isn't good at dealing with hand/finger LE, for goodness sake get a \"second opinion\" from one who has some experience. Fingers can be harder to manage than an arm, but there are so many options for getting it under control and maintaining it that you don't need to be discouraged about that. Kinesio tape is definitely worth a try. Do let us know how it works for you. Kicks, here's information about the Circaid Reduction Kit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T85hsb07OA Hugs, Binney ",

      "Content": "Jun 22, 2010 01:32PM - edited Jun 22, 2010 01:34PM by Binney4 Good morning, CAW! Armpits are the...uh, the pits. (Sorry about that -- got halfway through the sentence before I realized what I was saying.) But they're not impossible, and I'm betting you'll get this under control and that feeling that you're smuggling walnuts under your arm will go away. Just takes some trial and error. Here are a couple of options, depending on how much area you need to cover. On this page, check out the \"Kimbe spot\": http://solarismed.com/store/cart.php?m=product_list&c=4 You wear it with the inside curve under your arm. It extends several inches in front and in back of your armpit, so if that's all that's bugging you it's probably enough. And on this page, look at the \"thora-thigh spot\": solarismed.com/store/cart.php?... The curvy place goes under your arm and the two sides extend much further across both front and back. It's especially good for that pesky back swelling that's so hard to cover with any bra or cami. They're both bulky -- this is not an item to wear under a tight T-shirt. I use a Kimbe spot (it was named after Kim B., the designer who came up with it many years ago, BTW) and I just stuff it under my bra or cami. It tends to migrate toward the front if I'm active, so on one of them I hand-stitched a square of the \"hook\" kind of Velcro, and that gets a grip on my bra and holds it in place better. I haven't tried the thoro-thigh spot, but I'd bet it wouldn't move around at all.  At night you might be more comfortable holding it all in place with a breast binder (get the lined kind -- more comfortable). The Expand-A-Band ones come in pretty colors and patterns: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_binders_lymphedema.htm On the swell spots, the site I gave you is the manufacturer (Solaris). Sometimes they're cheaper from bandage supply places like BandagesPlus, so look around before you order. If your insurance will cover them you'll need to order them through your DME supplier. I haven't ever looked into insurance for swell spots, but I think I will next time I order one. Not sure how they'd write the prescription! The whole point of controlling the swelling is to keep the lymphedema from progressing. Controlling it helps to prevent infection (which causes further damage to the lymphatics) and to keep the excess protein in the stagnant lymph fluid from doing it's damage (which includes fat deposits under the skin, fibrosis caused by tissue inflammation, and skin changes). So the answer is yes, you can prevent it from getting worse. Whether you can keep it out of your arm or hand depends more on the kinds of risk reduction strategies all bc patients can use to hold off LE. It is definitely NOT inevitable. Here's' page of them: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Never apologize for asking questions about LE, CAW! The more we all ask, the more likely we are to be heard and to spur more research and better care. Without all our very loud and persistent questions there will never be any answers. Onward! Binney",

The whole thing has to be fit perfectly and with the right degree of stretch, so if you sew something onto it you've altered it and could cause lymph blockage. What you can do is order a bottle of It-Stays, which is a brush-on skin adhesive that works well for keeping garments in place (assuming you aren't allergic to adhesive, of course!) Bandages Plus stocks it and ships internationally. http://www.bandagesplus.com But nowdays most brands of sleeves do come with silicone, so I'm betting it won't be a problem. Do ask your fitter to be sure. People with leg lymphedema are the ones who generally have problems keeping their garments in place, due to all the walking and the steady effects of gravity. We've rarely heard anyone here complain about garments slipping down (assuming, of course, that they were well fitted in the first place -- a too-big garment will slip, for sure.)

I'm wondering, when you saw the LE therapist, what treatment did you have? Did she do MLD and wrap your arm/hand daily for a couple of weeks? Suggest gentle exercises to do while wrapped? Teach you self-MLD and wrapping? If so, have you been doing any MLD to try to deal with this new issue? Even wrapping your arm might help -- it does ease my truncal pain some when it's flaring.

Please give her a hug from us \"Sisters of Swell\" and tell her we send our best wishes. I know your question is about the safety of treating LE in the presence of cancer (which, by the way, is up to the doctor, not the therapist -- it's long been assumed that treatment that moves lymph fluid is not a good idea with metastatic cancer, but recent research evidence is finding it to be safe). But I just have to tell you that Deep Oscillation is not standard treatment for any kind of LE. The treatment for truncal LE is Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD), a kind of gentle massage that a therapist performs daily for two to five weeks (or more) until the swelling is reduced, followed by fitting for a bra, cami, or compression vest that will control swelling, ease any pain or discomfort, and help prevent the threat of infection that goes hand in hand with LE. Many of us have had difficulty finding proper and adequate LE treatment, especially for truncal LE, because there are no states yet that mandate training standards for LE therapists. So we have to be our own advocates. And what we should insist on is a therapist who has had at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her PT or OT certifictation, and preferably at least a year's supervised experience treating LE. You'll want to ask about the amount of experience treating truncal LE too, since it's less well known than arm LE. Here's a web site where you can find a fully-qualified LE therapist near you. Click on the Therapist Locator and follow the links: www.mylymphedema.com In other words, since you and your mom are both \"a little nervous about that,\" I'd suggest that you go by your gut feelings and look around for at least a second opinion. The National Lymphedema Network has a couple of Position Papers that might help, one on Therapy and another on Therapist Training: www.lymphnet.org Mimi, thanks for your advocacy and care for your mom. I wish you both comfort and confidence as you search out the very best care for her LE. Please come back and ask if you have any questions going forward. Be well! Binney ",

Dr. Mei Fu at New York University is doing some studies concerning this problem of measurement of LE, since it's so basic to ANY lymphedema research for all the players to be on the same page regarding standards for diagnosis and measurement -- otherwise their results indicate little about the reality, and studies can't be compared to one another to gain further insights. So she's looked at and compared bioimpedence, perometry, water displacement, and tape measurement, as well as various scales for patient reporting of early LE symptoms. What she's discovered is that bioimpedence is most frequently inaccurate, missing a majority (I believe) of the actual confirmable LE. In order to continue her LE research, in fact, she's had to purchase a perometry unit, which is extremely expensive and only measures limbs, not truncal LE. So there are limitations with everything we currently have available. She now recommends using all those techniques in combination for the most accurate approach to both clinical diagnosis and research. Along with that, though, is the LACK of research to confirm the accuracy of bioimpedence measurements. But I'm not sure how they'd set up a study to do that, since it's the ONLY method put forth to detect sub-clinical levels of fluid accumulation. Mei Fu is busy (understatement!) but accessible, so your former therapist might want to contact her regarding her findings (which have not to my knowledge been published).  Or she'll be at the Conference in September, if your therapist plans on going. Frankly, I'm bummed. (So is Mei Fu, for that matter.) A reliable measuring technique for early detection was an idea that held soooo much promise. Hugs, Binney",

It used to be believed that ANY lifting, or even any use of the affected arm could bring on lymphedema, which is swelling caused by damage to the lymph nodes and vessels that normally carry lymph away from the cells and back into the circulatory system. (The lymph fluid is there because it's the body's garbage truck, bathing the cells and carrying off any nasties, to be dealt with severely -- it's part of our immune system. Which is why stray cancer cells end up in our lymph nodes.) Anyhow, that's not the belief anymore. Research has proven that exercise (even weight-lifting) is actually helpful to both preventing and controlling lymphedema. In fact, the April \"Ask-the-Expert\" on-line conference here at bc.org will be about Lymphedema and Exercise. Great! Okay, but there are precautions, and picking up an angry 25-pound dog five days after a mastectomy is, as you suspect, pretty much over the top. Still, it sure is understandable, so don't waste too much energy beating yourself up. What you need to do going forward is avoid straining the arm or tiring it, always. So as you recover, take it real easy, but do keep on exercising (preferably starting with the post-mastectomy exercises you got from your surgeon or the nurses at the hospital). The \"no pain, no gain\" philosophy is a thing of the past for all of us. For more information on lymphedema Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel check out the Position papers on those subjects at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org. Once you've read those you'll have more updated information about lymphedema than your friend's doc does! Of course that's not what you were asking about -- more like, could it do damage to the surgery. So I trust others will be along shortly to address those concerns. Be well! Binney ",

I can just imagine what a struggle it would be to convince a doctor that you're dealing with abdominal LE, when so many of them can't identify garden-variety arm LE, not to mention upper truncal. It is rare with bc treatment, but certainly not unheard of. I have some abdominal LE too, also mostly on my right side (my LE is bilateral in both arms and trunk, but worse on the right). It's hard to make suggestions without knowing what you've already tried. Do you both have well-trained LE therapists? Have you been taught to do Manual Lymph Drainage with emphasis on the abdomen? Are you clearing neck and groin nodes at all throughout the day? Do you wrap your arm? Has your therapist taught you other practical helps, like staying really well hydrated, using deep abdominal breathing, or doing simple LE exercises at intervals throughout the day? I can manage my abdominal LE with just those measures (and I wear a WearEase cami called a Slimmer that also adds gentle abdominal compression), but many people with abdominal LE use biking shorts to control swelling. It's also possible to order custom abdominal compression garments, but I'd sure try the other methods first. Lots of things can affect abdominal LE, just like arm LE. Barometric pressure changes, extreme temperatures, lack of exercise, the wrong sort of exercise, weight gain, and for some people salt intake and alcohol. If you can identify triggering mechanisms, that can help your therapist design a self-care program that will help you take control of this and get your life back. If you need a new therapist, or even just a second opinion, here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified... There are a couple of suggestions here for abdomen/upper leg compression--they'll give you an idea of what kinds of garments you can look for: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Compression_camisol... And here's a discussion of Swell Spots and other garment inserts--the one on this page are specifically for upper body truncal LE, but they are designed as well for use with abdominal swelling: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/foampadding_swellsp... StellaStarr, LE is lymph fluid that is trapped all over in the tissues, not pooled like the fluid in a seroma that can be drained. The way to drain the lymph fluid in LE is to clear nearby nodes and gently move the fluid out of the area and toward the nodes by the manual technique of Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). A well-qualified LE therapist will be able to design a personalized flow pattern for your situation to effectively move that fluid out. Then compression garments keep the fluid from building up again. None of this is easy, because LE is chronic, but practicing some self-care does give us back control. Insist on getting the great help you need! Gentle hugs, and please, both of you, tell us how we can help, Binney",

Good thing, too, because if exercise and the gentle lymph massage were a danger to moving cancer cells, we'd have to sit absolutely still for the rest of our lives to avoid trouble! Any movement of our muscles moves lymph fluid. The superficial lymph vessels lie between the muscles and the skin, and the pressure of those muscles moving against the lymph vessels is the major way that lymph moves, since it has no pump like the heart. So anytime you move, you're stimulating lymph flow. Which is what you want, since it's a crucial part of your immune system. Hope that helps. Be well! Binney",

(The medical professionals responsible for the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of lymphedema are specially trained lymphedema therapists, to whom your oncs and surgeons should refer you, since their own training does not include this area of expertise.) The type of bandages to safely wrap an arm at risk for lymphedema looks like an ACE bandage, but it's entirely different and acts very differently. Lymphedema bandages are \"short-stretch,\" meaning they don't have anywhere near the elasticity of an ACE bandage. They're specially ordered from a lymphedema medical supply provider. They must be applied over a layer of stockinette specially cut to fit over the arm and hand, and a layer of thin foam or soft, strong cotton wrap, and the wrapping of the short-stretch bandages must then be done with the firmest compression distally, gradually working proximally with decreasing pressure. Generally at least three layers of varying widths of short-stretch bandages are applied over the stockinette and foam base layers. It takes most of us a couple of weeks of practice, supervised by a specially trained lymphedema therapist, to learn to do it safely and effectively. If you are already used to dealing with medical applications of bandages you might be able to learn it more quickly, at least if you are also already familiar with the action of the lymph vessels. The specific gradient wrapping technique for lymphedema allows the muscles underlying the lymph vessels to act as a lymph pump by applying gentle pressure and pushing the lymph in the proper direction, as determined by the gradient compression of the bandages. Applying an ACE bandage to your arm has a different action. It actually cramps the lymph vessels shut and blocks flow in exactly the same way that a blood pressure cuff does, overloading the already-compromised lymph system and quite possibly resulting in lymphedema. Or to put it simply, never apply an ACE bandage to your at-risk arm. Be well! Binney ",

The incidence of breast lymphedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy and radiation therapy is 23%; with axillary lymph node dissection and radiation therrapy it is 35% in node negative patients; and 48% in node positive patients.\" (There are footnotes for each of those statistics that lead to substatiating studies.

Still interesting. people like that, though, who have waited years for a diagnosis of their LE and have been told to lose weight or take diuretics all these years, are often understandably discouraged and unmotivated, or searching for quack \"cures,\" so it's not always encouraging or helpful. But for me at least I still find it valuable. LymphedemaPeople http://www.lymphedemapeople.com This is Pat O'Connor's website. He\u2019s had long-time primary LE and cancer, and he's a fountain of information. He relies on research for his information base and he has an amazing network of people he can call on to help answer any baffling questions. His website too offers an abundance of articles, and these are updated continuously. Advocates For Lymphedema http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/AdvocatesforLymphedema This Yahoo group includes a number of LE advocates and therapists as well as patients who are interested in influencing legislation or simply awareness of all kinds of LE, not just cancer-related. This is my favorite site for keeping up with new research and discussing its implications Lymphland http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/lymphland/ This active Yahoo group includes all kinds of LE and it\u2019s chatty and friendly, but not research oriented so it can get off track at times Komen http://apps.komen.org/forums/ Komen has message boards, but none devoted specifically to LE. There are fairly frequent mentions of LE, but there\u2019s no particular organization or expertise here. Association of Cancer Online Resources http://www.acor.org/ The LE discussion group here includes only cancer-related LE, but from all kinds of cancer, so it includes leg LE.

A number of people in the LE community have vocally questioned the accuracy of their \u201canswers\u201d on the LE board in the past, so at least now they're more accurate, but they\u2019re very scanty in their detail and tend to direct you to treatment rather than answer specific problems BC Support http://www.bcsupport.org This site has a specific discussion board for LE, but it\u2019s slooooow, with little discussion on any given post and little information available.

I wonder if you've seen a well-qualified lymphedema therapist? The problems you're having, both with the carpal tunnel and the elbow, are often associated with lymphedema. Before any swelling is visible or measurable, there can be as much as a 30% increase in lymph fluid volume in your arm, and this extra pressure on your nerves and the extra weight on your joints and connective tissues can all add up to real problems with carpal tunnel and tennis elbow. In that case a more conservative approach to treating it all is Manual Lymph Drainage therapy done by a lymphedema therapist, which will move the excess fluid out of your arm and relieve the pressure. It's well worth checking out. Unfortunately, the lymph system is not much taught in U.S. med schools, so our doctors are often not aware of these options. A consultation with a well-trained lymphedema therapist will both diagnose any fluid build-up that may be unmeasurable, but also give you help (and consultation with your  doctors) with any surgery that may be necessary. for help finding a qualified therapist near you, check out the links on the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. I pulled up another thread for you called \"Carpal Tunnel Syndrome with Lymphedema, anyone?\" Though you have not been diagnosed with lymphedema, the advise there and the articles that are linked will apply to an arm at risk for lymphedema as well.

The quadrants are like chicken quarters, and in our case it's a wing quarter that's involved: hand, arm, shoulder, and front and back of the torso from the waist up, and as far over as the center of the body. Manual Lymph Drainage works the nodes in the neck first, since they accept fluid from this quadrant, and it works the nodes in whatever part of the body the therapist plans to send the lymph to--in the case of a unilateral mastectomy that would be the opposite axilla; in the case of bilateral surgeries, that would be the groin. Then the therapist works within the quadrant that's affected, moving the fluid toward the nodes. So, no, it's not necessary to work the entire body in order to treat LE. And yes, that would be great and it sure wouldn't hurt anything! Next best is to do the necessary MLD to the involved quadrant and then also do some targeted exercises that help the whole system to flow better. Sherry Lebed has an exercise DVD and some Youtube videos available that are specifically designed for that purpose. I quit doing them daily for awhile and just started up again because for me it's really important to controlling my LE. You can order a DVD here: https://www.gohealthysteps.com/shop/ As for the general ignorance about LE among our healthcare providers, here's information written specifically for them by a doctor who has LE. You might want to make some copies and pass them out to your array of nay-sayers. We shouldn't have to educate our doctors about a serious medical condition like this, but then again it really is our privilege to do so--the women who come after us deserve better! www.stepup-speakout.org/essent...\u2026 Be well!

Whether that's true with other compression bras and camis I don't know, though, because they do work well with prostheses. I use a WearEase cami (they make a bra as well) and don't have any trouble with the uni-boob effect with prostheses.

But I have to say that your experience sounds a lot like mine -- that sense of \"imagining things\" and not being able to get it confirmed one way or another. I went around for months fearing it was \"all in my head.\" Very unsettling! There's no way to measure breast/chest lymphedema, because we breathe and that changes the measurements. Arms are a different matter, of course, but when it's in our chest instead there's no standard criteria to use for diagnosis. Which leaves us with having to trust our own sense of what's going on. In your case the fact that the bra fitters mentioned it to you is actually significant. I'd trust them on that and go for treatment. I can't tell from your post whether you were evaluated by the therapist or just talked to her. If she did a physical exam she could likely tell from the feel whether there's lymphedema there or not. But that's still a somewhat subjective judgement call. The proof of truncal lymphedema is sometimes only in the treatment: if Manual Lymph Drainage helps reduce swelling and the sensations you're experiencing, then it's lymphedema. (There's a test called lymphoscintigraphy, but it's invasive and not available everywhere, and since you've had bc surgery there's already a basis to believe that what you're dealing with is lymphedema). All that just to say, yes, I could see why a therapist might tell you that. More helpful would be to ask her how much experience she's had treating breast lymphedema, and what treatment she would offer you if she determines that's what you're dealing with. Does any of that help? Do keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

But I will say we don't hear about that happening here on the lymphedema board, so at least we can say it sure isn't something that happens always. Radiation can make lymphedema worse, or at least harder to manage. Do you have a good lymphedema therapist? If so, do talk to her/him about this. Do you have well-fitting compression sleeves and gloves that you wear regularly, or can wear regularly during rads? That helps to keep the swelling in control throughout. Staying well hydrated is essential too, and now that the weather is generally cooler (in the northern hemisphere at least) it can be hard to remember to keep drinking lots of water. Plan to elevate your arm whenever possible, even at night on pillows. If you know how to wrap, consider wrapping more often during rads. If you don't, do insist on learning how to do that--it's a great tool to have in your lymphedema tool-box for anytime you travel or experience a flare. You're right--this is a really crummy accompaniment to bc treatment, and it adds a lot of frustration to an already-difficult situation. We're all here for you--please tell us how we can help.

The website mentioned above, http://breastfree.org, is a good place to find pictures of mastectomy results, and also stories of others who have made this decision and lots of information about coping, both emotionally and practically. Like how to find the right bras and prostheses, for example. There's also another board here at breastcancer.org that's for those of us who have had mastectomies without reconstruction. You can find it in the main board index or go directly to it here: http://community.breastcancer.org/topic/82 Pain-wise the surgery it easier than many -- not so hard to recover from as abdominal surgeries, and not so debilitating as, say, hip or knee replacement. But no surgery is a piece of cake, and the loss of our breasts is a real loss, which calls for time and space to grieve and to heal. That said, I have to say I have never regretted my decision to have bilateral mastectomies and no reconstruction. While it's not fool-proof, it's a huge load off my mind. And I'm sure not missing those mammos! Wishing you a peaceful mind with whatever decision you make, and a permanent end to the bc. Be well! Binney ",

That's an average, of course: some schools (he found) don't teach it at all. I mentioned that to a friend here who's a doctor and she told me that was not at all accurate for her own training. In fact, she said, at her school they spent a lot closer to 20 minutes on the lymph system -- nearly a third more time than the average! Dreaming, I hear you on the frustration of dealing with uninformed doctors, but if we all fired all the surgeons, plastic surgeons, oncs and PCPs who don't know squat about lymphedema we'd lose almost all of them, even some of the very best in their fields. The standard CDT treatment for lymphedema has been practiced in parts of Europe for a very long time, but it's much more recent in the U.S., and it's taken a lot of re-gearing to develop training programs for lymphedema therapists (who are the only LE specialists we have in the U.S., since there is no recognized physician specialty in lymphology here.) Even now there are no training requirements mandated for LE therapists in any state, so plenty of untrained and undertrained PTs, OTs and MTs accept LE patients they really haven't got the skill to treat. But they're free to call themselves LE therapists, and the referring doctors don't know to check out their training (even if they had the time to track it down, which they don't). Even accupuncturists have to meet certification standards, but not LE therapists -- so how's a doctor to know that? Unless, of course, we patients tell them. Some doctors will listen to us, some won't. Research has also been nearly non-existint until very recently -- at present we're experiencing something of a LE research Renaissance, so hooray for that, at least! MOTC, your surgeon is definitely the exception -- next time you see him take him some brownies and tell him we all salute him! As for the rest of us, onward!

Wrapping is not anybody's idea of comfortable but, no, it shouldn't hurt more than it did before. On the other hand, it's heavy and may be causing grief from the unaccustomed weight, so before you unwrap try elevating it on something soft and comfortable for a bit and see if that helps. If not, you sure wouldn't be the first person to ever take the wraps off! You didn't mention Manual Lymph Drainage massage, but hopefully your therapist did that for both chest and arm before wrapping, yes? That would be the accepted and necessary protocol, although some therapists shortcut and neglect to do it. If she's been properly trained she should know how to do that, and you should expect it. For what to expect from therapy, you might want to see the Position Paper on Therapy at the National Lymphedema Network here: www.lymphnet.org And this page about therapists from the StepOut-SpeakUp site: www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Wrapping the chest or breast is usually not done. Instead, massage is followed by wearing a compression vest or bra. Some options are here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Hope some of that helps, Tina, and that you manage a restful and painfree night. Enjoy the snow for me -- I'm a desert rat! Very gentle hugs, Binney",

But even then we give ourselves the best possible chance for a good outcome. If you're going to use your LE arm, it's better to use it for blood draws (where you're not adding anything) than for IVs (where you're adding fluid to an already compromised system, which may not even be able to deliver the IV contents predictably or effectively). Feet and neck can be used for IVs (as you seem to have experienced), and if you use them right off the bat instead of trying your \"good\" arm first, the whole process will be less painful and stressful. Keeping your LE in excellent control will make using that arm for any purpose less of a potential problem. Afterward, keep a close eye on it for infection (even delayed infection, as cellulitis can \"percolate\" before making itself known). Elevate your arm, stay extremely well hydrated--basically, follow all the guidelines for a flare even before you have one.  Plan to visit your LE therapist as soon as possible after any \"insult\" to your LE arm, for extra treatment and evaluation, as well as management tips. If after using your LE arm you do develop an infection, or even intractable new swelling, then you'll need to reconsider. But for now, considering the distress you've had to deal with, please don't beat yourself up for trying less-than-ideal ways to manage your healthcare needs. LE is bad, but it's not all we have to deal with, and sometimes it just needs to take a back seat to other considerations. JMHO. Please keep us posted. Gentle hugs, Binney",

Surgery's a special case, since you go into it already thirsty. For that I don't take their \"No water after bedtime\" or \"after midnight\" at face value but check with the surgeon about EXACTLY how many hours before surgery I have to stop drinking. Not only do I guzzle water the two days prior, but I set my alarm for the specified time and get up and drink all I can hold then. Otherwise it can be waaaaay longer than is actually necessary, especially if you're not scheduled first thing in the morning. For blood draws, I checked with my doctor about taking aspirin beforehand--thins the blood and really helps it flow. Since I'm bilateral, I have a footdraw order too. I make sure to exercise (walking, jogging--gets the blood flowing) before going, wrap my foot in a microwave heating pad (being careful not to get it to hot) for the trip there, and in the waiting room keep walking or bouncing my leg up and down--everybody looks at me like I'm crazy, but it really helps. Legs stagnate when you're just sitting there. I always ask to lie down. For some reason they don't always think of that themselves, but it's much more efficient for them than bending over my foot and trying to reach all their supplies. They can lay everything out right there. I switch the heating pad from my preferred foot to the other, just in case the first draw fails and they need another foot. Then, for some reason, I've found that deliberately relaxing all my muscles makes the whole process much easier. Not only hurts less, but it seems to make the vein access easier, too. So I concentrate on slow abdominal breathing and relaxing. Don't know how much of that is actually physically effective and how much of it is just a ritual that soothes me, but...whatever helps!

Scar tissue, type(s) of surgery, location of fibrotic areas, and other health conditions all need to be taken into account. Still, they're good basic instruction for self-massage. Youtube has a number of videos, many of them aimed more at spa-type lymph treatments. Of the two above, the first one is a fair introduction to at least the order of a lymph drainage routine, but it leaves out most of the actual process. I do like its emphasis on slowness and light touch, though. The second one it simply misleading, and I'd suggest you avoid it. Calmness, relaxed muscles, and a very slow, very light touch are all important. It should be relaxing! Hope some of that helps! Binney",

Dozens of the women here have contributed to the Lymphedema StepUp-SpeakOut.org site, so it's full of practical information about living with lymphedema. When you have some time you can browse the site, and it sure helps to know you're not alone! On the \"Lymphedema Garments\" page at StepUp-SpeakOut you'll find links to lots of garment makers. Since fitters and therapists usually deal with only one or two brands, it helps to know what others are available so you can introduce them to other brands they may not be familiar with. each brand will have its own special strengths, so you should be able to find some with features you need. For instance, some (like Bio-Concepts, Barton-Carrie, and Gottfried) come in a wide range of colors. Others offer fabrics with different features -- either softer or firmer -- or one manufacturer may have a variety of fabrics. My own favorite is Gottfried, both because the fabric is soft and comfortable and because they offer an elbow lining that cuts down on elbow irritation (and feels wonderful!). My fitter likes them because they have great customer service, which is another quality to look for in the brand you choose -- if the garments are not working for you, you need to be able to return them for adjustments or a remake. The page at StepOut-SpeakUp about \"Proper Fitting of Compression Garments\" will help you understand how to \"shop\" for sleeves and gloves that will work for you. All the brands suggest replacing them every four to six months, and you'll find out what works best for you as you try them out. Partly, it depends on how much you wear them. I need mine daily, all day, so I replace them every six months -- but I do find the old ones go on being useful for \"dirty\" activities like re-potting plants or working with paints or marking pens (I'm sorta piggy!), or even for large-scale cooking adventures. So don't toss the old ones when your new ones arrive! Some of the women here wear their garments only when they're having trouble -- on hot days, say, or when they're exercising or traveling or doing something tedious like cutting with a scissors, or after a salty meal of pizza. Whatever bugs them individually. Others have to wear them all the time. With the help of your therapist, you'll discover what works best for you. Nighttime is a different matter entirely. The daytime garments should not be worn when you're sleeping, because they're designed to work with your moving muscles to help keep the lymph flowing. So most of us wrap our arms at night or wear special night garments that are quilted fabric stuffed with foam chips. These are not sexy, as you can imagine, and they're toasty (unless you store them in the refrigerator during the day -- seriously!), but they're reasonably comfortable and they're easier to put on than wrapping. Again, your therapist should be able to help you determine what you need to do at night. The garment page on StepUp-SpeakOut.org includes night garments as well, so you can get an idea of what they look like. I'll leave the video suggestions to others who I'm sure will be along. Your therapist is the one who should teach you to do these things, so jog her on that if she isn't doing it yet. Videos can be good memory refreshers, but the actual skills can only be learned in person, as there are so many factors to be taken into account. A good book with illustrations and instructions for both wrapping and massage is \"Lymphedema: A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing\" by Burt and White. Again, it's good as a reference, but your therapist should check out your skills at both before releasing you. As 3jaysmom suggests, it's important to learn to wrap your own arm and to do self-MLD massage, so that you have the tools to control your lymphedema wherever and whenever it needs extra attention. The learning curve is steep, and it can be really frustrating to learn it all, but in the end it really pays off in independence and taking charge of your life again. Glad to have you aboard for this crazy ride! Be well, Binney",

Nobody ever told us we had a lymph system, much less what would happen to us if it got wrecked. And for most of us, our doctors don't seem to know much about it either. (Like you, my onc told me I was not at risk because I was thin, so apparently that's another of the myths that have made the rounds of the med schools.) According to Burt and White in their book \"Lymphedema: A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing,\" (which is a great little reference book to have on hand, BTM) the short stretch bandages help in several ways. + they form a semirigid support that the muscles can work against, which improves the muscle's pumping action that causes the lymph vessels to contract and move lymph fluid + they influence the movement of fluid in the teensy spaces between cells so it will move into the lymph vessels + they increase the total pressure on the tissues, which makes the tiniest lymph vessels take in more fluid, and which also causes the tiny artery capillaries to dump less fluid into the tissues in the first place -- great double whammy! + they prevent fluid from reaccumulating in the tissues + and, even though they're as ugly as sin, they actually have a cosmetic function (who knew!), because they improve and maintain the shape of the arm by keeping the amount of compression consistent throughout treatment So, lots of good things going on out of sight (and certainly out of our comprehension!) while we wear the stupid bandages. And moving your muscles while wrapped improves all those functions even more. Estepp, the more you can wear them the better and quicker your results will be. Hang in there! Tell us how we can help!

What you're describing doesn't sound much like LE to me, but LE's a sneaky bugger so check it out. The \"red\" can sometimes be a sign of infection, but not in both hands at once, so... Do let us know that your therapist says. Maybe elevation will help, and if you're using heat to ease it remember to use only warm, not hot. LE sure does take some getting used to. And unfortunately, since it's not going away we've got plenty of time to get used to it! As for the hypervigilance decreasing, at seven years out I want to say yes. But just give me a new symptom to worry about (anything--a sore toenail will do it) and I'm right back in Panic City.

The compression garments are not meant to reduce swelling you already have -- that's what the therapy is for. So unless the sleeve and glove are now too tight, you might still get some value out of wearing them, as they'll help prevent further swelling. If you're cruising somewhere hot, try to stay as cool as possible. Stay out of hot water, as in a spa or hot tub, but swimming is great and may even bring some of the swelling down. Eat hardy! But do try to stay away from too much salt. Stay hydrated (that'd be water -- no, margaritas do not count!), and while you're lounging around on the deck it won't hurt to keep your arm elevated.

In answer to your question about truncal LE pain, besides the sometimes achiness and feeling of fullness, mine is a nerve-type pain, doesn't respond well to any of the usual pain meds, and it tends to move around a lot, so it can be hard to pin down. I'll try to put a finger on the place where it hurts, but if I do it just seems like, no, that's not quite it, it's over there. And so on. Before I saw a lymphedema therapist who really knew what she was doing and diagnosed it for me, I thought I was cracking up. With therapy (and continuing self-care) it's controllable, and that's worth gold to me. Sure hope you soon have real relief! Binney",

You're right -- with the L-dex bioimpedence device they put the little gadgets on your arm. Painless, quick. The only problem with it is that folks who are using it don't \"get it\" about what it is they're measuring. It measures the amount of tissue fluid volume. Not the lymph flow, not the stage of LE, not even whether you have LE or not. It is NOT a diagnositic tool, but a monitoring one. There are no standard numbers that show that you do or do not have LE, but only (over time) whether you have more or the same amount of tissue fluid volume. The way it SHOULD be used is to monitor your arm consistently with every visit. The first reading tells them nothing, it's the trend they're supposed to be looking for. If the next few visits show gradually increasing tissue fluid levels, then it's a good guess you have LE. Or if you have LE already, it can tell you how you're doing with control of stagnant fluid. Here's a danger that we're all going to be facing if this method of measurement becomes popular: if they try to diagnose LE using this machine, some of us with LE (especially well-controlled LE) may no longer be eligible for insurance coverage -- especially if they start telling us our LE is not LE but causd by scar tissue and blockages. Scar tissue can create blockages that cause LE. The fact that the blockage is caused by scar tissue doesn't make it some other kind of swelling -- if the lymph fluid is blocked, for whatever reason, you have LE. That, in fact, is what a lot of truncal LE is, and some of the arm LE too. Of course there CAN be other kinds of swelling -- like swelling caused by blood clots, for instance, or kidney failure. But that's another whole diagnosis. Please, c-mouse, NEVER think any question regarding LE is stupid -- you're one smart lady to be asking questions! Hugs, Binney",

It's 108 at the moment, heading higher as the afternoon drags on. As Beesie so aptly says, you can't know until you know. And as Lisa says, the waiting is aaaaaaaugh! I can SOOOOO understand your wanting to hear happier resolutions than a cancer return. (It isn't often anyone thinks of lymphedema as a \"happier\" anything, but in your situation it's sure understandable!) At any rate, nothing you describe so far would rule out a lymphedema diagnosis. Ultrasound is not diagnostic for lymphedema, nor does it show as fluid if (as you might expect it to) if lymphedema is present. That's because in lymphedema the fluid doesn't pool into pockets (like it does in a seroma or even a cyst). Instead, it disperses among all the cells. That's also why it can't be aspirated like seromas and cysts can. Basically, there's no diagnostic test for lymphedema (or I should say, there aren't any that are commonly used), so with your symptoms the doctors are really trying to rule out everything else it could be. And since we're cancer veterans, one of the things they try to rule out is more cancer. Don't be surprised if their next recommendation is a doppler or CT scan to rule out a blood clot, which can also cause swelling. \"Very swollen, tender, and warm to the touch\" can all describe breast lymphedema (which is actually called truncal lymphedema, but that always reminds me of elephants.). Unfortunately, they can also describe the beginnings of a cellulitis infection that's often associated with lymphedema. So if there's new or spreading redness, or if you develop even a slight fever (you might start taking your temp a couple of times a day if you aren't already doing that), you'll need to get help immediately. No \"wait and see\" with that. Geesh, I'm so sorry you're having to suffer through this waiting time. We sure don't ever get used to it, do we?! Sending you big, very gentle (((((hugs)))))), and prayers for quick and happy answers, Binney ",

My therapist says it's unusual (she told me jokingly that my lymph system must have been installed upside down!), but it's certainly not unheard of. I do find the Solaris Palmar Spots really helpful, inside my wraps or inside my gloves. The worst thing for making my palms swell is leaning on my arms -- as in riding a bike or just standing next to a table and leaning on it with my arm straight, or kneeling on the floor and supporting myself on one arm while I clean up a spill. Even resting my elbow on my desk and then resting my head in my hand. Boom! Practically instant palm swelling -- <sigh!> The MLD massage for palm swelling adds another step. Because the top of the palm drains to the back of the hand, take the fingers of your opposite hand and gently run them up your palm and between the fingers of your affected hand. Do that several times before clearing the back of your hand and hopefully you'll see some reduction. Another idea besides the Palmar Spot is, when you are ready to order gloves, it helps if the person fitting you adds a bit of \"give\" to the measurement around the palm. Otherwise, the way our hands are made, too tight compression pulls the sides of your hand inward and the fabric doesn't even touch your palm when your hand is at rest. If the measurement there is a bit looser it results in greater compression in the palm area. Hope that makes sense -- works for me so I usually don't have to use Palmar Spots, which make my hands sweat in the summer. The Palmer Spot is used for back-of-the-hand swelling too, by the way, because it tightens the fabric across the back of the hand as well. Hope I didn't just make this more confusing! Be well!

There has been an explosion of LE research in recent years, but even with that there are way too many unanswered questions. Risk rates for various triggering events would be especially helpful, but they're so complicated. What our lymph system is like even before bc is undoubtedly a large factor, but at present we don't even have a way to determine that. So much more to learn -- really glad we have such a wealth of researchers now who have a passion for LE. Onward, all of you research heroes! One thought occurred to me in reading your post, LindaLou, and that is that an at risk arm may in fact be at serious infection risk as well. Before any swelling is visible or measurable by our current means there can still be up to 30% more lymph fluid stagnating in the tissues than is normal due to the compromised lymph system. If we could find a way to accurately detect that early LE we'd be way ahead in terms of making these kinds of decisions. Bioimpedence has been touted as a way to do that, but in practice it's proving to be unreliable, so we're back to Square One on knowing what's really going on in our at-risk arms. <sigh!> KC, if you go with the leg bp during surgery, the calf is a whole lot more comfortable than the thigh.

It's a thrombosed (plugged up) lymph vessel that's actually fairly common after breast cancer surgery. It can run from your armpit to your thumb or anywhere in between and can sometimes even be seen or felt in places along its length as a tight cord. It can be treated with gentle stretching exercises and usually resolves in a few months. It sometimes returns, so you'd need to do the exercises again. A knowledgeable therapist (preferably one fully trained in treating post-breast cancer lymphedema) can help you with the stretching and easing of the tightness. Here's a page about cording from the StepUp-SpeakOut site: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm Hopefully that'll at least give you another idea to pursue.   Sure hope you get complete relief soon!

I have night garments by both Solaris and JoviPak. They're similar. I like Jovi's fabric better, but the Solaris fit is better. Solaris will also put a full arm zipper in my sleeves, which Jovi won't (I've never been able to find out why not -- for me, with bilateral LE, the zipper is a huge help with donning and getting out of it all in the morning, but it's not a feature everyone needs, for sure.) Both companies will make either a one-piece sleeve/glove combo or separate sleeves and gloves. I prefer the one-piece, partly because I hate losing gloves and I'm too oblivious to keep track of them when I slip one off to do something. The other thing I like about the one-piece is that it's more comfortable at the wrist.  Jovi will sew a special pad into the palm of their gloves, and I don't know if Solaris will or not because I've never asked. I'm not especially crazy about the customer service with either of them, but my fitter really likes dealing with Solaris (although she's learned not to deal with one person there -- why is this all so complicated!!!) Jovi has some innovative designs and will listen to your fitter's ideas about what you need (but won't talk to you because you're a patient -- wha'?!!). Solaris is a bit less adventurous, but their basic ideas are sound and, for me at least, they always fit well. In actual use, they both last about two years (even if the warranty is only for one year). Neither is adjustable like the Circaid, though both companies will make adjustments for a fee. Their fees are not very cheap. On the other hand, both the Jovi and the Solaris are soft and will fit in your refrigerator on summer days so they're nice and comfy-cool when you put them on. They're both washable and dryable, too, which is very handy, especially if you tend to wear them around the house during flares or when traveling and are sorta piggy like me. There's another company called Peninsula Medical (which for some reason isn't on the StepUp site -- we should fix that) that makes a stiff, adjustable-type sleeve called a Reid Sleeve, and a soft, directionally stitched foam one similar to Solaris and JoviPak. (They also send out free lymphedema alert bracelets for the asking, either one for yourself or a couple dozen for your bc support group. Their employees fill those bracelet orders on a volunteer basis, on their own time -- I think that's incredibly kind. Kudos, Peninsula!) I hope someone who uses one of these will come along and tell us about them. They're here: http://www.lymphedema.com All of which was probably more than you even wanted to know. Sorry -- got carried away! Have a great trip anyway, even if you have to do the stupid wrapping! Binney",

Do be sure to stay well hydrated throughout -- even make it a point for a few days in advance. Make sure your skin is supple and well lubricated for some time beforehand so that you don't develop any abrasions from arm movements while running (or biking, for that matter). There was an NLN article awhile back about garments, and it mentioned that getting them wet slightly increases the compression, so if you're wearing well-fitting garments to run, then get them wet, they may cause you problems. If you're wearing older, stretched out garments, though, they may not be the protection you need when you're running and biking. Mkayk, it's so neat that you could compete and be comfortable taking the time to get your garments back on between events. Possibly practicing that for speed would be helpful?

I'll second Bobbie's advice about clarifying -- and perhaps considering another therapist. Day garments need movement in order to have their good effect, and when you're sleeping they can slip out of position and bind and cut off lymph flow. (I've napped with day garments on and I woke up with a very swollen hand and lower arm.) Night garments are quite different. They're made (by companies like JoviPak, Solaris, Telesto-Medtech, and ReidSleeve) to work on your arm while you're not moving around. They have the same kind of action as the bandages do. Most therapists consider wrapping the arm at night better than using night garments, but realistically the night garments are much easier, and therefore much more likely to be used. You can look them up here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema_garments.htm Most night garments are washable, fairly easy to get on and off, and they can be chilled during the day so they're ready to keep you cooler on warm nights. With good care they last a couple of years (as long as YOU don't change sizes). Some women use them for travel too, with the ease of getting them on and off being one helpful feature.

So, Montrial, this could be a good therapist, but one who seems to advocate this particular practice which now seems to have a bit of a following. In that case, though, it's still up to you what you choose to do about it, knowing it's not standard practice. There's a \"work in progress\" called the American Lymphedema Framework Project that is drawing together medical professionals from all specialties (since the lymph system affects all the systems of the body) to detemine best practices in treating lymphedema. We really need this, so I hope they get it off the ground before too long. Once we have that in place we can refer to it for guidelines on treatment, and all these disagreements and controversies will be easier for us patients to navigate. In the meantime, the UK has already published their Lymphedema Framework document, and anyone interested can find it here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/ In the right-hand column, click on \"International Concensus: Best Practice for the Management of Lymphoedema\".

Hopefully some of those strategies will soon begin to bring you some relief. It's certainly not just about the physical problems though. Lymphedema is really an emotional experience.

Even though it doesn't deal directly with abdominal LE (or even breast LE), it's been very helpful to me because it has sections that are interviews with women who have LE, and seeing that they were as upset about it as I am about it really helped me cope with it better. (I don't say that because you sound upset -- actually you sound amazingly calm about this whole ordeal!

We are  wondering if by limiting the damage to the arm lymphatics, that may  ease the strain on the trunk lymphatics as well and result in a  decrease of chest/breast LE. 2. How is this study taking into account the added stress and damage  to the lymph system caused by reconstruction surgery, radiation  treatment, and possibly certain chemo drugs?\" To which I promply received this reply: \"Thank you for the interest in our protocol.  We, too, are excited about the prospect of reducing the risk of lymphedema. To answer your questions, at this time, we are only studying the development of lymphedema in the arm after surgery.  We have no plans to study truncal lymphedema. We are following the patients for a minimum of 4 years after surgery and during this time we will keep track of their treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, hormonal therapy, reconstruction), but we will not be including these factors in the final data analysis. We wish you the best and please contact us with further questions. Laura\" So we aren't going to find out about the truncal. Maybe next time!

The issue is to make sure the fit is good so there's no constriction anywhere. Once you have them, check with your therapist to be sure the fit is right, then start gradually with them (no more than an hour the first time you have them on) to be sure they're not causing redness, aching, purple fingertips() or chafing. Any doctor on your team can write the prescriptions. I get mine from my MO. My therapist, like yours, doesn't do the fitting herself, but it's up to her to decide on the compression level and any other special considerations. If you're not buying custom garments, don't let the DME company sell you just whatever they've got on their shelf -- if you don't like the fit and they don't have the size/style you need, they should order it, not push off the wrong garment on you.

Your post on the Lymphedema board didn't mention the area was warm to the touch, but that sets off a lot of alarm bells. A compromised lymph system (from the rads in January) means there can be lymphedema present well before any swelling appears. And stagnant lymph in the tissues creates a very high risk for a kind of infection called cellulitis. Sudden unexplained swelling and warmth to the touch are two possible symptoms. Cellulitis needs immediate attention!! It can spread very, very rapidly and become systemic, which requires hospitalization, but if treated early you can be on top of it with oral antibiotics. Please don't wait for Monday morning if you have any question about this being cellulitis--just head for the ER and say the words \"lymphedema\" and \"cellulitis\" to everybody who sees you (I'm not kidding--they can overlook this waaaaay too easily!)

In fact, it's one of the basics of self-care. It dilutes the thick, protein-rich lymph fluid so the compromised lymphatics can be more efficient at removing it. Since staying well hydrated is good for so many other reasons as well, you might want to experiment with increasing your fluid intake and see if that works for you. Just a thought. Be well, Binney",

While the risk is somewhat lower for the non-cancer side, it would still be a poor idea to move fluid toward the opposite axilla, as Teka describes, since that could overwhelm the compromised lymph system on that side and create a greater risk of lymphedema. Teka's massage routine is specific to her, taking into account her individual surgery history and any scar tissue in the area (lymph fluid can't readily cross scar tissue). You need a prophylactic massage routine specially suited to your own situation, and a lymphedema therapist can design and teach you that. Be well! Binney",

If so, wrap 'em until you can see the therapist again. If not, that'll be something you'll want her to teach you real soon, since fitting of gloves can take awhile (as Kira so noted!) The beauty of wrapping is that you can adjust the compression as needed and tolerated, which you can't do with gloves. Well, and also it helps reduce swelling, not just prevent swelling like a glove does. Sorry it's so hard to get this garment business right, MOTC, but just want to reassure you that once you land on a brand (and size, if you're not needing custom fitting), it's lots easier. It gets better, MOTC, honest! Hang in there! Binney",

They are good about customer relations, and besides they've been hearing a lot lately about the hands being too short on their garments. (Ahem! Thank you, Kira!) Hopefully your re-order for the same complaint will help give them pause for thought. They do seem to be anxious to get it right, so your input is valuable and has some chance of being useful in changing the way their garments are made. And that will benefit all of us! Together we really CAN make a difference! We don't talk much about amount of sleep in relation to LE control, but that and stress both seem to play a role in how LE behaves. Sure does for me. Thanks for bringing it up, Suzy. (And the crummy part is, insomnia seems to be all too common after bc treatment.) Keep an eye on the bandage suppliers for seasonal specials -- it can reduce the cost and/or give you free shipping. They seem to have specials for every occasion, so there should be something coming up shortly. When I was first diagnosed there was a local woman who became a bandage supplier out of her own home. It was amazing to be able to go there and see and feel all those products, compare brands and go home with them the same day. Kinda took over her house (not to mention her life), so eventually she closed it down, but it was great while it lasted. Too bad we don't all have somebody like that close by! Welcome back, Jennifer. Please do keep us posted! Hugs, Binney",

The current guidelines read under 15 minutes and: \"Avoid placing limb in water temperatures above 102°Fahrenheit (38.9°Celsius)\" The idea is to avoid heat directly to that quadrant of your body, and to avoid raising your core body temperature (which happens when you soak even part of you in a hot tub for very long -- which is why they say 15 minutes.) Personally I wouldn't risk it myself, but all I can actually offer is the NLN guidelines, which are written and updated by their (very impressive) medical board. Some women turn down the heat to the recommended 102 degrees and continue to enjoy it at their leisure, and that seems to me to be more reasonable than even the 15 minutes at higher temps. We all make our own compromises! Be well! Binney",

Solaris will put a full-length zipper in, wrist to near the top (Jovi will not--only a zipper on the top or the wrist). For some reason I don't understand a lot of therapists think zippers are a no-no. My guess is they consider it might irritate your skin or provide less compression along that seam-line. Or maybe they're afraid we might catch our skin in it when pulling it up. I have no clue. I love my zippers (well, as much as I \"love\" anything to do with LE in general or night garments in particular). They make it so much easier to get on and off for bathroom trips and other, uh, night-time activities. And of course they spare my jaw, where I'm inclined to bash myself when pulling up the zipperless variety. They also are much easier after a shower or on a warm summer evening, when being damp can make getting into the stupid thing a real challenge. My sleeves don't slip down. I suspect yours might be either too loose at the top or just getting saggy with age--two years is about it for night gear, though they're really comfy when they're old and worn-in. Ask about a pull loop when you order. Might not need one at all if the new sleeve fits better at the top. If you're paying for it out of pocket check out what they'd charge for a pull loop, because these \"extras\" can get ridiculous. Let us know what you decide and how it goes!

A feeling of fulless is also typical. There can be pain, but there isn't always. My therapist uses a special technique of small stationary circles with the very tips of her fingers in between the ribs to reach the deeper lymphatics where the congestion occurs. A not-so-experienced therapist might not know how to do that. Just some thoughts. I hope you soon have answers. Gentle hugs, Binney",

I just read a paper this morning that estimated between 40 - 80% of women who currently undergo bc treatment will develop truncal lymphedema (though nowhere near all of them will ever be diagnosed). Undiagnosed and untreated lymphedema can lead to serious and repetitive infection and to further lymph blockage, and it can also be a source of pain, so it's not a harmless condition at all and deserves attention and treatment.

They're the ones trained to recognize LE as well as address it. Now that you've ruled out the more immediate concerns, LE is the option to consider, and you want to get on it right away before summer hits full on. With the trauma to the left side that you describe, certainly LE is a likely outcome. When LE is bilateral the Manual Lymph Drainage patten is different than when there's only one side involved. The fluid must be moved downward toward the abdomen/groin, rather than across to the opposite side. It's important to clear all lymph nodes in the groin and abdomen beforehand, so the fluid doesn't simply gather there. So, a new routine to learn, but knowing how to manage will keep you much more comfortable through the humid months. If a compression cami is too much for you, you might try a compression bra instead--possibly a bit cooler. I prefer the cami, even through the summer, since I'm bilateral and want to keep the fluid moving downward. Hope some of that makes sense, and that you'll soon have answers and all the help you need.

The rest of the family can go to the grocery store, but all those public clinics have a policy of not doing it anywhere but in the arm. If there's an older nurse there I can usually slip up quietly to her and tell her I've had bilateral mastectomies, and she'll do it in my thigh. But I never have any luck with the younger ones. I get flu shots at my oncs office. Jadeblue, I always get BP on my lower leg and blood draws from my foot. Most labs will tell you they won't do foot draws, but if you show up with the order in hand and the doctor has written \"Draw from foot only\" on it, they'll find a way to do it. The gal at my lab who does it sometimes brings her colleagues in to see how it's done. Afterwards, one of them said to her, \"I don't see what's different about doing it in the foot.\" And my gal said, \"Nothing. It's exactly the same, except that it's easier because the veins are bigger.\" Go figure! There are a few things I do to make it easier. I take baby aspirin for a couple of days beforehand (check with your doctor first!) and make sure I'm well hydrated. Then I warm up a microwave heating pad and wrap it around my foot before I leave the house (not too hot!) While I'm sitting in the waiting room I keep bouncing my legs up and down to help the circulation. And I ask to lie down when doing the blood draw. Wishing you smooth sailing with your up-coming surgery. Do let us know how it goes! Warm hugs, Binney",

Takes about five minutes and measures the interstitial fluid (fluid between the cells) in your arm. Bravo for your PS! By monitoring your arms before surgery and at three-month intervals afterward he can tell if fluid is accumulating even before you can see or measure it. If so, you can be fitted for a compression garment early on and may be able to avoid the long therapy where your arm has to be wrapped for days and weeks in layered bandages. Yes! Painless, quick, safe -- and it shows a real awareness and concern on your BS's part for your long-term well-being and quality of life. The devise is made by a company called Impedimed, and you can read about it here: www.impedimed.com . There are already several studies that substantiate the use and effectiveness of this for early intervention for lymphedema. Lots more information about lymphedema, including a position paper on Risk Reduction at the National Lymphedema Network here: www.lymphnet.org . Can you tell I'm a real fan of this? Do come back and tell us how it goes, yes? Hooray! Binney",

It's well worth looking for an evaluation and treatment now.

For flying (or any travel where change of altitude would be a factor) a low-compression sleeve and gauntlet or glove would be advisable for that arm as well, but it would be important to be sure the fit was good. It's a controversial issue in the LE world, but in my case my LE started on the prophylactic side, with a plane trip, so I take a pretty conservative view of precautions. On the other hand, I don't think this new study shows that if your mom has LE from a single groin node removed that proves a genetic link. Some primary lymphedema is genetic, some is not, so even if her lymph system is less than adequate, it doesn't prove yours is.  So caution yes, but despair, no. Hugs! Binney",

But I'd like to add a suggestion that you get any doctor on your team to give you a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist. S/he will be able to do a thorough evaluation, take baseline arm measurements for future reference, teach you a simple any satisfying lymphatic massage you can use prophylactically, talk over risk reduction ideas with you, and fit you for a sleeve and glove you can wear for travel and exercise. You sure don't have to have lymphdema already in order to take advantage of a therapist's knowledge and help. Not all therapists are well trained, so you need to do some detective work to find a good one.

I wish I just did them every day, but I'm not that consistent. When it bugs me, though, I get right back at it and it helps enormously, and right away. I've tried the Bellisse and didn't like the fit, though some women find it helpful. Best help for me during the day is either the bra or the Slimmer from WearEase. I wear the Slimmer inside out as it's easier to access the prosthesis pocket, and it cuts down on \"bridging\" from the height of the prosthesis, but they're so well made you can wear them comfortably either way. For night, the Expand-a-band chest wrap works, but I'm more comfortable in a Solaris vest -- gentle compression, wide shoulders so it covers the area behind the axilla too, but you can have it designed any way you want. It's hot, so I stow it in the fridge during the day and put it on cool. Not having breasts anymore, I can also use a between-the-ribs finger massage my therapist taught me that stimulates the deeper lymphatics, and that helps too. When I'm having trouble I also resort to clearing neck nodes and chest (MLD) several times throughout the day. Like you, my arm swelling seems to be related to the truncal swelling. If the top of the sleeve is too tight it causes a chest flare (and pain -- yuck). I don't know why that is. It doesn't make sense to me as far as how the lymph system operates, but nothing about LE makes much sense. Can't use kinesio tape because of severe skin sensitivity in the chest area to adhesives. I use either \"chocolate bar\" hard foam pieces or a kimbe swell spot to control flares, depending on how aggressive I need to be. Weather affects this for me. Barometric pressure, heat, and humidity all complicate my life. Also overuse of my arm. Be well! Binney",

So I hope you get quick and clear answers and real pain relief. What you're describing might be Axillary Web Syndrome, which is fancy-talk for \"cording.\" It can occur anywhere from your thumb to your axilla and from your axilla down across your chest to your waist. It usually can be felt with your fingers as a cord-like structure, but sometimes it can't be felt distinctly (especially if there's excess weight in the area). It hurts when you extend your arm and limits how far you can extend it. It's not dangerous and it's usually treated by gentle stretching of your arm, either by yourself or with the help of physical therapy. If that's what it turns out to be and you stretch it yourself, try it when you're standing in a warm shower by gently reaching your arm up the wall toward the shower head. Cording itself is not LE, but it is related to LE. The \"cord\" is made up of tissue, some of which is lymph tissue, and women who experience cording do often go on to develop LE. There's lots of information about LE and especially about lowering your LE risk at the National Lymphedema Network, www.lymphnet.org  Do let us know what you discover. And get better quick! Binney ",

Are you using any kind of breast compression (a compression bra, cami, a tight sports shirt, breast band, etc.)? There are lots of suggestions for breast/chest compression at the bottom of this page: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Summer's rugged. Since you're feeling some hardening in the breast I'd suspect the summer might just have made you aware of LE that was already present in your breast, not really made it \"spread\" there. At any rate, good MLD, staying really well hydrated, and using breast compression may give you relief until you can escape to that spa (ahhhhhh!) Let us know what you find out when you see your therapist. Gentle hugs, Binney",

      "Content": "May 9, 2009 10:43PM Binney4 wrote: Hi, MOTC, Those are good questions. The compression sleeves can keep the swelling from progressing, but they're not able to reduce it or to break up the fibrotic areas that may have formed. Wrapping with layered compression bandages creates a graduated compression with enough of the right kind of \"give\" to it to both increase the pumping action of the lymph vessels (which of course have no \"heart\" like your blood vessels do to move things along) and to actually cause a reduction of the whole area. It also allows for proper padding of troublesome areas of extra swelling, tough fibrosis, or extra sensitivity to pressure. In trying to visualize how your lymph system was compromised by treatment, you can see readily enough that the damage was done up near the axilla during surgery and/or radiation. In other words, even if the only swelling is in your hand, that is NOT where the damage is. It's some distance from there, in fact. If you successfully move the accumulated lymph fluid out of your hand it still has a long way to travel in order to get pushed past the area that's \"broken down.\" So if you don't treat the entire length of the arm you run the risk of moving fluid out of the hand only to have it collect higher up in your forearm, elbow, or upper arm. So wrapping is standard practice, usually 23/7 (you remove it to shower and go back to therapy), until the whole thing is reduced to pre-lymphedema proportions (or until it reaches a plateau period). Usually that's a couple of weeks, but it will depend on your therapist and the way your body responds. Then you switch to a compression sleeve and glove during the day, and usually (though not always) wrapping at night (or wearing special night garments which are more comfortable -- and bulkier -- than day garments.) There are therapists who skip some steps, but trust me, you don't actually want that because it just drags everything out and makes it harder to gain control. Here's our page about wrapping: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/wrapping_bandaging_for_lymphedema.htm And here's one about the massage part of treatment: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/manual_lymphatic_drainage_massage_lymphedema.htm As you can see, lymphedema is not for wimps (so what am I doing with it?!!) But you can do this, and we're all here to help. It'll be good -- honest! Binney",

Solaris has a \"Kimbe spot\" that works really well to cover the axilla and a bit of the side and direct the fluid flow out and down. My WearEase comes up very high under my arm, so with the Kimbe spot that really eases things. I also have night vests custom made by Solaris and JoviPak to come up high under my arm and across the back of my shoulder. The custom night sleeves snap onto it so it covers everything. I sometimes have to resort to that during the day if the swelling and pain are bad, but they really do bring me relief. Layering compression can be a problem because a second garment of the same compression class won't double the compression, so it's not very predictable and may be uneven or cause binding. If you try it don't wear it more than an hour without giving it a rest and seeing how it's going. If you know how to wrap your own arm, I'd sure do that for now until you can see about a sleeve that's not so tight at the top. The trick is to get it tight enough not to fall down your arm, and loose enough not to constrict the flow at the point where it should be loosest. I can understand why a too-tight sleeve-top would theoretically make my ARM swell, but that's not what happens for me -- it makes my armpit and the top of my chest swell instead. But then, my therapist insists my lymph system was installed upside down... Maybe a second opinion would be helpful? If so, the StepUp-SpeakOut page about finding a therapist might help. Hopefully OneBadBoob and others will be along with some suggestions -- we need all the options we can get!   There is, by the way, a new garment company just starting up that makes a sleeve that goes clear across the shoulders and ends in a short sleeve on the other arm, so there's compression high under the arm and around the shoulder as well. I'm anxious to try it, but at present have no idea how well it works. Their brand-spankin' new website (still under construction) is here: http://www.thelymphedemasleeveco.com/ Be well, KC! Binney",

The \"CLT\" title usually applies to therapists who are \"certified\" by the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA), but all they have to do in order to gain that certification is to prove they've already taken the 135 hours and then pass LANA's written test. They don't have to demonstrate any clinical ability, and they don't have any obligation to continue to treat LE in the approved manner once they're certified--LANA does not have a review committee or a way to deal with patient complaints about therapists. So the LANA certification only tells you they took the training, not that they're any more competent than any other therapist who has the training but not the LANA membership. So ask about their hours of LE training, and don't worry about the \"CLT\". If that doesn't make sense, let me know and I'll try to explain to it better.",

LE research is not well funded (no surprise, right? Grrrrr!!) Slowly but surely, LE research is moving forward anyway. Not fast enough, of course. The whole lymph system has historically been ignored (the fact that most of it is invisible didn't help throughout the ages when all the other bodily systems were being \"discovered\" and studied.)

I hope you'll ask her about this theory and see if she has made any observations about it. I think your podiatrist's observation is fascinating (well, it's fascinating any time you find any kind of doctor who even knows what LE is!) Just wondering, have you ever had any lymphoscintigraphy studies to prove or disprove the primary LE idea? Do you have relatives in the dim and distant past who had LE (or \"milk leg,\" or dropsy?) Interesting, and one area of research interest by the Lymphatic Research Foundation (along with other possible risk factors, like inflammatory response). Be well!

Either (or both) of those should help with both the burning and biking. If the pain in your arm is enough that it keeps you from moving it, there might be something else going on there that you'd want to check out with your doctor, as arm lymphedema usually doesn't cause outright pain like that. Other than that, all I can suggest is that bike riding can put a lot of downward pressure on your hands and arms, and for some of us that really aggravates the swelling and discomfort. It isn't a matter of strength, but of pressure and gravity. Are you a bike racer, or is this strictly recreational? Other handlebar arrangements might be more workable if what you want is something more leisurely. We had a thread here awhile back about biking that was full of good ideas. I'll go see if I can find it and move it to the top for you.  Hope you get good help soon -- Spring is too good to miss out on! Be well, Binney",

It is possible for the swelling of LE to be limited and not make itself known except occasionally, while the disease is still progressing within the tissues. There are several processes involved in LE, among them an abnormal fat deposition beneath the skin and an accumulation of fibrotic tissue as a result of the inflammatory aspects of LE. As these progress (without treatment) they can result in skin changes, limitations of strength and range of motion, possible leakage of caustic lymph fluid through the pores, and sometimes a kind of cancer called lymphangiosarcoma. LE does not progress rapidly, so without pain or constant swelling it can be easy to ignore it, but definitely best not to. Do keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

You do to look around for a new therapist, or if that's impossible, sit down with one of the ones you've already tried, show them the National Lymphedema Network position paper on treatment (Kira posted a link to it above), and tell her you want her to follow that protocol: daily wrapping until the swelling is reduced, teaching you to wrap yourself -- and then maybe think about going to another fitter who can actually fit you properly. (Have you checked out all the links on the StepUp-SpeakOut therapist page? http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm) If you are not swelling at night, for goodness sake don't accept a night garment. The swelling should be under control with wrapping before you order ANY garments, and if you accept the ones she's offering you now your insurance may not pay for another anytime soon, when you arm is in better shape. Wait until your arm is well and truly reduced and you have the skills to keep it that way. Many of us wrapped our arms at night for weeks or months after therapy ended and THEN decided if we wanted night garments or not. Don't let her push you into that. As for her using a pump, she should only use it AFTER she has done Manual Lymph Drainage on you herself -- it is not a substitute for the hands-on lymph drainage that she is getting paid to do. NEVER let her use a pump on you if she has not first manually cleared your nodes herself, and she should also clear your nodes again when the pump session is over. And for goodness sake don't let her sell you a pump yet. It may be at some point you'll want to look into that (or maybe not), but now is not the time. Don't calm down just yet! You may not have a ready supply of great therapists close by, but you sure don't  have to settle for this one's definition of your new normal. You're going to be just fine -- hang in there!

Another one of those \"more research needed\" areas, for sure. There also seems to be good reason to believe that \"popping\" the cords (as some therapists are prone to do, because it produces instant relief) is probably not a good idea. Better to massage it gently, and if the cords pop on their own that's considered less of an issue. Why, I do not know. As someone with bilateral lymphedema despite having only a single lymph node removed on my cancer side, and no lymph nodes purposely removed on the prophylactic side, I'm a strong believer in leaving both arms alone where blood pressure, blood draws and IVs are concerned.

Just for starters, the number of toll booths is arbitrary--there is no set number of lymph nodes, so some of us have more, some less. If there were 20 tool booths and you reduced it to 2, that's a whole lot more congestion than if there were three and you reduced it to 2. So it matters what your starting point is, and there's no way to determine that. Recent research indicates that not only do we have different numbers of nodes, but the lymph system itself may be more or less efficient in different women (or men). There's even some indication that those people whose hands swell, for instance, when we hike, or whose feet or legs swell during plane trips may be experiencing a less efficient lymph system (though that's certainly not conclusive yet). But to make it even more complex, we may also have individual experiences of \"trauma\" of any sort to our chests or arms. Secondary lymphedema (the kind we're talking about with bc treatment) can happen to football players who get repeated blows to their chests, to people who have been thrown forward in traffic accidents, and to anyone who has suffered a crush injury to their arm or leg (one major example was the earthquake in Haiti some years back, when huge numbers of people developed lymphedema as a result of injuries from falling buildings.) Women who have had any breast surgery, regardless of cancer, are at risk. The repetition of even less dramatic trauma over time can eventually add up to developing lymphedema. So it's impossible to predict at present. There are a number of women here, myself included, who have developed lymphedema with a single node removed , or no nodes removed during a simple prophylactic mastectomy. There are others with large numbers of nodes removed who buck hay bales on a daily basis and have never had a problem. The bottom line is to be aware of the possibility of developing lymphedema, and to seek prompt treatment from a qualified lymphedema therapist at the first indication of a problem. Early signs of arm lymphedema include heaviness, achy feelings, or just \"feeling strange,\" or changes in the way a ring or cuff fits. Truncal lymphedema (breast, chest, back, side or underarm) indications include heaviness, pain that is hard to pin down and doesn't respond to OTC pain meds, and longish-lasting marks in your skin where the straps or bottom band were when you take off your bra. Of course visible swelling is also a possible sign, but it is often not the first one. The earlier you seek treatment, the easier it is to reduce any swelling and to keep it in control over time.

Once I realized it was leaking I could see where the joint between the front and back pieces was wrinkled and didn't quite close -- it just hadn't been made right. But it took me several days to figure it out. The first thing I noticed was a streak of \"dirt\" down my abdomen. I couldn't imagine what it was, but when I took a shower and tried to get it off, I had to scrub at it. The next day in the middle of the afternoon I felt something stiff on my skin below my bra, and when I looked, there was a streak again. I washed it off again (with some effort) and wracked my brain trying to think what it could be. The next morning when I was putting the prosthesis in the pocket it suddenly occurred to me it might be that. I checked, and sure enough. Of course I returned it with no trouble, and the fitter told me she'd never seen that either. Like the rest of us, she was really curious and tried squeezing it to see what would happen, but not much did.

An Isotoner or Imac glove (from the drug store) that has at least partial fingers would be a better bet. And ACE is generally not a good idea with LE because it's too stretchy and will allow the layers of wrap to shift and be hard to control. With LE involved you want gradient compression that will move the fluid upward, and ACE can't do that. Better to use some gentle cold--for no more than 15 minutes at a time, and with a layer or two of cloth between the ice pack and your skin. Elevation, as often as possible, even on pillows at night. And stay really well hydrated. Some deep breathing at intervals will help too, because it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in your body. Sure hope you get some clear guidance soon!

GOOD thing you were into martial arts before your bilat -- good physical conditioning before this hits makes a lot of difference to what you'll be able to handle now. It sounds like you have a PT, but you don't say what treatment you've had for your lymphedema. Did you do a Therapy Intensive, with two or more weeks of daily massage and wrapping? Have you learned lymphedema self-massage and how to wrap your own arm(s)? Do you have sleeves and gauntlets for both arms (both are at risk if you've had bilateral surgeries, and if you have lymphedema in only one arm, you sure don't want it in the other!) YOU KNOW your body! If your arm feels heavier you need to act quickly to bring that into control and keep it that way. That means, yes, wearing you sleeve and gauntlet every day. But also wrapping at night (or using night garments if you have them), extra self-massage, and paying close attention to whatever might be aggravating it (certain activities, periods of inactivity, heavy salt intake, dehydration, weather changes, travel or altitude changes, etc.) Journey, a PT qualified to treat lymphedema should have at least 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training beyond her/his PT certification and preferably at least a year of supervised lymphedema experience. Unfortunately there are no state laws mandating this preparation, so there are plenty of underqualified therapists out there. If you'd like a second opinion on your therapy there's information on finding well-trained ones near you -- and what you should expect form therapy -- here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm (You're in a good spot -- Atlanta is home to a lot of really good therapists!) You do need to be sure your lymphedema is in good control (no new swelling or feelings of heaviness) before you return to training, but once you've got that taken care of the good news is that exercise is excellent for controlling lymphedema. You'll need to take it extra slow, though, build up slowly and attentively. Punching a padded target with force is, unfortunately, not likely to be real helpful for your lymphedema, but that's just something you'll have to experiment with once you've got everything well in control, and see how it goes for you. Since you already have lymphedema in one arm, that arm might be better protected during aggressive activity if you wrap it, rather than wearing compression garments. Wrapping promotes lymph flow as you exercise and may make things possible that wouldn't be doable otherwise. BUMMER! But, Journey, it gets easier. Please keep us posted and let us know what you discover. Hugs, prayers, Binney ",

I don't see mine anymore, fortunately for both of us. Scheduling LE into your day is (fortunately!) highly personal. I exercise in bursts throughout the day rather than all at once, which may not be ideal but it works for me. (I saw an interview with a very sensible PT on TV once, and when he was asked if it was true we shouldn't exercise right before bedtime he said if that was the time you were most likely to do it, then that's when it should be done. Makes sense to me! Same thing for all the other aspects of LE care.) Lymphedema starts out being completely overwhelming, taking over every thought, ruining every plan -- and then gradually you manage to take change of it and sort it all out, and it starts to come together into something you can actually control. We learn everything we need to know, and then we decide on the compromises we're willing to make. There are \"tools\" -- skills, really -- you need to have so you can manage on your own:  Self Manual Lymph Drainage massage (designed specifically for your needs) Self wrapping in layered short-stretch bandages An understanding of what needs exercising, how much and how often A small emercency kit that you keep with you that contains - antiseptic wipes antibiotic ointment bandaids your medical history, including LE precautions (no bp, IV, injections, etc.) A list of LE supplies showing brand and size you use and where you can order them, as well as a time-table for when to replace them. Since you're bilateral you also need well-fitting garments (sleeve and glove both) for your other arm too, to use for travel, exercise, and unusual or strenuous activities (shoveling snow, cleaning closets, etc.) All in all it's a steep (and expensive) learning curve, but it's finite. The problem is, as Kira points out, that we have to do so much for ourselves, and we're used to having more-or-less expert help with our medical needs. That's okay -- this is chronic, so the more we can depend on ourselves the more freedom we have. It's the only way to take back control of our lives. You'll get there, Journey! It'll be good! Estepp, to put it shortly, symptoms do include swelling, of course, but before that's even noticeable or measureable there can be as much as 30% more fluid in our tissues than is normal. So lymphedema begins welll before the swelling appears. Early symptoms include tingling, aching, heaviness, and feelings of fullness. In the chest or breast, pain is often the first symptom, but usually outright pain is not a factor in arm LE. If you experience any of those symptoms, get a referral for evaluation by a fully-trained lymphedema therapist. (In fact, getting a referral BEFORE you have any symptoms is really smart -- gives you your best shot at avoiding it!) There's a page about finding a qualified therapist further up on this thread -- it talks about therapist training too. Hope you never have to join our \"swell\" sorority! Be well, all! Binney",

I'm really sorry about the worries that have brought you here, but hope you'll find both help and encouragement on the boards here. You are smart to insist on a biopsy for IBC, because you need the peace of mind in order to get your life back. But the truth is that peau d'orange is indeed a sign of breast LE. The redness you describe can indicate infection, which is why your doctor put you on antibiotics, but it too is a sign of breast LE even when there is no infection present. Lymphedema is an inflammatory condition, and in the breast in particular it can present as redness that does not go away with antibiotic treatment (simply because it's not an infection, its inflammation). That said, if you have LE present, the risk of infection is high (bacteria thrive in the warm, protein-rich accumulation of stagnant lymph fluid--sigh!) So, especially since you're doing rads which can compromise your skin, you need to keep a sharp eye out for infection on top of everything else. The kind of infection most commonly associated with LE is cellulitis. Here's information about how to recognize it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Med... Okay, so what you need to know is that treatment of breast LE (which consists of Manual Lymph Drainage massage and wearing some compression) can not be done while you're doing rads, or until your skin heals following rads. So you have a way to go before you can begin to get that in order. But once the LE is treated it will both reduce the swelling and restore the skin texture and color. (Some women have a bit of lingering pinkness to the skin even once the LE is controlled.) Here's more information about breast LE (which is also referred to as truncal LE): http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunck... While you wait for LE treatment, there are some things you can do to help control it: 1. Stay really well hydrated--this helps keep the lymph fluid flowing. 2. Stop throughout the day and take a few deep abdominal breathes--this stimulates the largest lymphatic vessel in our bodies, which runs from shoulder to abdomen and can be pumped by the diaphragm. 3. As much as possible, take good care of the skin on your breast--ask your rads doc for help with any skin breaks or burns. 4. Gentle exercises act as a pump for your entire lymph system (there is no \"heart\" to pump lymph fluid through your body--muscle movement plus the structure and function of the vessels themselves do the pumping), so gentle arm stretches throughout the day will help. Just remember, no pain! 5. Speaking of pain, if you are having pain from the rads, do ask for help controlling it and stay on top of it--as a response to pain our bodies send emergency supplies of lymph fluid to the area. Just what you don't want! Other women will be along soon with further suggestions, I'm sure, and to share their experiences. Hoping some of this helps to relieve your anxiety! Please keep us posted and let us know how you're doing. Gentle hug, Binney ",

I couldn't imagine how it could be cost-effective, since our short-stretch bandages are re-usable for long periods of time and this is a one-time wrap. But their claim on the website is that because it can be left on for four days at a time you only need to see the therapist twice a week, and that saves on the therapy costs. So no wonder 3M, which is a US company, is starting in Canada -- here most insurance won't pay for the wrapping supplies, but they will pay for therapy, so for US patients this would amount to a huge out-of-pocket expense. My other question (which wasn't answered by anything I could find on the site or in the brochure) is about the Complete Decongestive Therapy itself, which includes the therapist doing MLD daily, not twice a week. So this sort of flies in the face of the gold standard of LE treatment. The one study I noted on the site was done with 20 people and no detectable control group, so this would seem to be an unproven modality at best. Still,  it looks comfortable, yes? I hope if some of our Canadian gals get to try this out they'll let us know how it works for them. Please?! Be well, Binney",

Swollen nodes don't occur from LE, but they can from cuts and burns, especially three at once! Do watch for any sign of infection from any of the injuries, as even slight lymphedema in your hand indicates lymph fluid stagnation in the tissues, and that really increases the infection risk. Even from a paper cut. (Before any swelling from lymphedema is even visible or measurable, there's already more than 30% more lymph fluid in the tissues than is normal.) So your nodes (part of your immune system) may well be working overtime due to the extra infection risk and resulting epic battle going on to stop it. Keep your whole hand clean, use a topical antibiotic, and if you note ANY sign of infection (redness, new swelling, itching, pain, warmth to the touch, fever) in your arm or hand, get medical help at once. ER if need be. Don't wait. Swedish massage includes deep tissue work, yes? You'd be better off avoiding that on your entire affected quadrant (arm, breast, back, side -- like a chicken wing quarter) since the whole area's at risk, and you can trigger full-blown LE at any time. Doesn't matter that it hasn't happened up to now. So massage could result in worsening of your LE, but I don't see how it could contribute to a swollen node. Glad to hear it seems to be reducing, at any rate. Prayers for that continuing, and no further problems. Keep us posted!

More compression is not necessarily better for reducing your LE risk, so if you've been using the Juzo garments and the fit is good, you might be better off sticking with that than trying something new. Use them for the trip up as well, whether you're flying or driving, because the change of altitude is a challenge to our lymph system. Generally, though, once you're at altitude for several hours you should be fine using them only when exercising, traveling or engaging in any activity you're not used to. Wear them again for the trip back down, as anytime you change altitude you'll want protection. Happy travels! Binney",

The oversleeves are cool, and even affordable. When I wrote to the company, though, they couldn't assure me that they would not be so tight as to cause constriction. They have an endorsement on their site from an MD, but as we all know (unfortunately) MDs are not always the best judges of smart LE choices. They couldn't tell me that their design process had been overseen or vetted by knowledgable LE professionals, either. Also, adding an elastic-type oversleeve runs the possibility of increasing the compression of the sleeve, without increasing the compression of the glove -- not a good combination. But I think if you tried the oversleeves and found them evenly loose enough all up and down the length of your arm, that wouldn't constitute a problem. The constriction danger would be if they were tighter at one place along your arm than at another (which of course depends on the shape of our individual arms), or if you bought a size that was tight all up your arm and added compression. Our other concern was that this might encourage women to wear only a sleeve (which could be covered with this oversleeve) and not their glove or gauntlet (which is still going to stick out and look like a stupid glove or gauntlet, after all). It's already plenty hard enough to have to wear our garments in public at times, so we didn't want to add to the temptation not to use hand protection. (Note that the picture in the ad doesn't show a model wearing a glove or gauntlet.) So we decided to list on the site the garment makers who make sleeves AND gloves or gauntlets in colors or patterns, rather than getting into all the guesswork of oversleeves. Besides, we have this discussion board for alerting us all to new products and developments like this one, so thanks, Jinky! Be well! Binney ",

The fear is real, but so many women talk about rads being \"a piece of cake\" that I felt intimidated to be having so much trouble with it. I had to take several days off at one point to do some tests because of unexplained pains I was having, so I know it's possible to take a day or two off and still get the benefit of the treatment. I'm hoping you'll get the explanations and assurances you need to proceed with confidence. The anxiety is so paralyzing--I had to make myself a chart with boxes for each treatment still to go, buy myself a set of beautiful stickers, and put one sticker up every time I completed a treatment, just in order to visualize that I was making progress toward getting through it.

      "Content": "Oct 3, 2008 08:56AM - edited Oct 3, 2008 08:59AM by Binney4 Hi, Doe, Tingling and numbness are frequently a symptom of lymphedema. Sometimes the first symptom you notice. And I've found that early in my LE, hand weakness was also a major symptom. My hands are still weaker than they used to be, and my grip it further compromised by the stupid gloves. Pain in the chest, back, and even neck can go along with truncal LE (just ask bygrace), or even arm LE, though most often LE treatment eases that pain eventually. And shoulder problems are common just from the bc surgery itself (not to mention the AIs). RIBP is a very rare side effect of bc treatment these days, due to improvements in radiation delivery. On the other hand, RIBP is obviously an alarming diagnosis, and the earlier you catch it the more possibility there is of arresting it (though those possibilities are at the present time pretty iffy.) So if you're concerned about this, do ask your docs to check it out for you. LE is lonely -- as Kira mentioned in another post today, it's considered an \"orphan\" condition by the medical community, and as we're all aware the general public (and even our bc sisters) are not aware of it and slow to pick up on the suffering involved. But RIBP is far lonelier. There is no support group on the web for this specific condition, and nowhere doctors can refer them for help or even more understanding of the condition. Too many doctors ignore our LE, but we still have therapists and a few dozen companies offering us innovative interventions. But with RIBP even the therapists throw up their hands and walk away. I do hope and trust what you're dealing with is not RIBP, Doe. But I really value your empathy for our Sisters who are dealing with this. Those with RIBP who have been posting here on bc.org take my breath away, and I feel so privileged to know them. Their thread was just moved here to the LE board last week from the \"Young Women\" board (where Erica started it some time ago) in the hope that other women of whatever age who are facing this alone will be able to find the thread and join the conversation. And also that with all of us fellow lymphers working together, hopefully we can find ways to ease the RIBP path, and maybe even unlock a cure for it. We're all in this together. Let us know what you discover, Doe! (((((Hugs))))), prayers, Binney",

It isn't impossible for this to be due to lymphedema, but it sure isn't typical. Sudden swelling can have other causes that need to be addressed promptly, especially considering the amount of pain. Insist on it. Once other causes are ruled out you'll want to see a really good therapist. Wrapping is a trial, for sure, but it's not forever (just seems that way! ), and it's a really important tool to know how to use. When lymphedema swelling gets out of hand garments won't fit correctly and may cause more problems, but wrapping can be adjusted to any amount of swelling. It's also important for traveling, for when you're sick in bed and not moving around much, and generally just to give you back control of your life. I'm really sorry about this lousy development, Sue. Get good help promptly so you know what you're dealing with and can get completely on top of it. Please keep us posted! Very gentle hugs, Binney ",

Lymphedema is a scary diagnosis for most of us--it's chronic, and it's hard to get good information about it, and sometimes even to find a well-qualified lymphedema therapist to treat it. I'm not sure where you heard that diet was a significant part of lymphedema treatment. It helps some of us if we avoid salt or alcohol, but aside from that there's little about diet that can affect lymphedema (except weight gain, but that doesn't sound like a problem you're having). The surgery you mention--moving lymphnodes from one site to another, or connecting lymph vessels to blood vessels for more effective draining--is still very much in the experimental stage and is certainly not standard lymphedema treatment, so please don't worry about the need for further surgery. Briefly, standard lymphedema treatment involves Manual Lymph Drainage, which is a kind of very gentle massage that helps to stimulate the lymph vessels (which are close to the skin) to move lymph more efficiently. Some special exercises help with that as well. And adding compression to the arm or other swollen area to help reduce swelling and maintain the arm in good condition. That compression at first is usually a special kind of layered bandage, applied by the lymphedema therapist. Later, when the swelling is reduced, you will be fitted for thin compression garments to use as needed (some of us need them all the time, others just for exercise or travel. All of that will be worked out with the help of a well-trained lymphedema therapist. Here's how to find one near you--any member of you medical team can write you a referral: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified... I hope some of that helps to calm your concerns at least a little. With gentle treatment and time to learn the \"ropes\" of managing this new challenge, you'll soon be on top of this. Please ask away if you have other questions, and do keep us posted on your progress. Gentle hugs, Binney ",

It's not something you do for long periods--just five minutes or so at a time. Putting your arm above your head part of the time would be a good idea, as is getting the kind with a safety bar attached so you don't take a tumble. Some women feel bouncing gently on an exercise ball has the same effect, so if that's easier or more convenient it's another option. Whatever, it's no replacement for self MLD and compression, exercise and great skin care, which are the standard self-care protocols. Hope that helps! Binney",

Make a copy for your therapist and tell him in no uncertain terms that you want the full CDT (Complete Decongestive Therapy) treatment. Early stage LE is the easiest to control, so for goodness sake do EVERYTHING you need to to keep it that way.

I've found them very helpful, but the area rep generally knows more than the fitting person, so when in doubt you'll have two people to contact. No short-cuts! Make sure the fitting person stays with you long enough to assess the fit throughout the routine. There are things a trained eye and an extra pair of hands can help with that you just can't see or do for yourself. Do let us know how it goes! Binney",

I hear you on avoiding drugs that give you that \"flat\" feeling, but then...what? The only thing I've found that helps is to try and cool the \"core.\" For a while when it was really bad I kept a couple of cold packs (stuffed with flax seed instead of water or gel so they didn't get ice-cold) in the freezer and stuffed one into my cami (\"between\" my missing breasts), changing them out as they lost their cool. Harder to do when you're not at home. For that those water-bead chill scarfs might help. As you're unfortunately discovering, wearing the dumb glove and sleeve is not exactly optional, and whipping them on and off isn't exactly efficient. So anything to cool the arm quickly might help, even a gel pak, as long as you don't leave it on your arm too long. Actually, the whole thing makes you feel like climbing into the refrigerator. Nasty business! Juzo has a new Cool-Vent glove out that I'm experimenting with. I find it keeps my palm and back of hand cooler and dry, though the fingers are still a problem. LE stinks. Hot flashes stink. The combination takes some maneuvering to manage. Sure hope others come along with some thoughts! Gentle hugs! Binney",

(MomsDaughter, are you going, and could you bring us back word, please?) Just a brief overview: Dr. Marga Massey has very recently joined Dr. DellaCroce's Center for Restorative Surgery in New Orleans, where they're famous for post-bc recon surgery and premium patient care. Dr. Massey has lately been working with a French doctor named Corinne Becker, who has been doing a lymph node transplant surgery for many years in France. Unfortunately Dr. Becker has not produced any studies large enough or objective enough to demonstrate the rate of positive outcome, the long-term effectiveness, or the safety of the surgery, so at this point in time we have little (or no) real understanding of outcomes. Dr. Massey and company are proposing to do a \"real\" study of their patients who undergo this procedure, so kudos for that! Hopefully their research will eventually help us understand more about not only how workable this procedure is, but even about how our lymph systems function. Love it! I'm a hopeless optimist! Okay, so what would we all like to know about this? Here are a few questions to get us started. Please chime in, all -- this affects all of us. Who are candidates for this surgery? Must women with LE have tried standard treatment (Complete Decongestive Therapy) and have found it unworkable to qualify? How about women who have had LE for many years? Women with Stage III LE? Women newly diagnosed who have not tried other therapies? Women with bilateral arm LE? Women with truncal LE? People with leg, abdominal and/or genital LE? How will research subjects be selected? What criteria will be used, and how long will they be followed for effectiveness and possible side effects? What possible side effects will you be specifically looking at? What method(s) are used for measuring and recording limb size for this study? Tape measure? Water displacement? Perometry? Bio-impedence? Limphoscintigraphy? Self-reporting? At what intervals will measurements be taken? QOL-specific testing? What aftercare specific to lymphedema will be used? Manual lymph drainage? Bandaging? Compression garment use? Specific or directed exercises? None? What guidelines for limb care will be given, and how will they be delivered and tracked? What variables of treatment will be considered and figured into the research? For instance, chemo and rads as previous treatment? Type of surgery? Node involvement? Current drugs (including tamox and the AIs)? Use of Avastin (bevacizumab) and other drugs that inhibit the regrowth of vascular tissue? Weight gain or loss? Diabetes or other conditions that affect vascular function? Age? Stage of bc? Number of nodes removed? What provisions will be made in the study for tracking and recording possible development of LE from donor site involvement: leg, abdominal, genital LE? Other thoughts? Thanks, MomsDaughter! Really important subject for all of us. Hugs! Binney  ",

A well-trained LE therapist can tell by the feel of the congestion if it is LE or not. Unfortunately there is no well-defined diagnostic measurement, either in amount of swelling or time it has to be there to qualify -- and truncal LE in particular is very difficult to quantify anyway. A variety of standards are used, which makes determining the percentages of LE occurrence impossible. If you're asking how long before Stage I LE moves to Stage II LE (which would involve fibrotic formation beneath the skin, more consistent swelling, and the beginning of the possibility that the swelling could not be permanently reduced), that too varies from one individual to the next. Could be a couple of months or a couple of years. LE can be present with NO visible swelling at all. That's called sub-clinical (or Stage 0) LE. It means the lymph system is compromised and lymph fluid is not being efficiently eliminated from the tissues. There may (or may not) be discomfort or feelings of fullness with Stage 0 LE. (As much as 30% more fluid than normal can be present in the tissues before any swelling is visible or measureable). The stagnant lymph fluid is protein rich, so it both irritates the tissues (causing a gradual build up of fibrosis and subcutaneous fat) and creates a heightened risk for serious systemic infection. Untreated, Stage 0 LE will eventually progress through the stages. It may be very gradual, though. Sub-clinical LE can be effectively treated with specialized massage, proper compression, exercise and skin care. If it's treated at that stage it's far less likely to progress or to result in serious infections.  So the amount of time that needs to pass before edema is considered LE may depend entirely on who's doing the considering. A well-trained LE therapist could call it accurately much earlier than someone without the specialized training.  I hope that helps some! Be well, Binney",

Perhaps if you gave your measurements to Lari-Ann there she could help you get the garments you need. 800-421-5647 Or try talking to some of the bandage suppliers. BandagesPlus and LymphedemaProducts both have fitters you can consult with by phone. I'm trying to figure out what the therapist is saying, and at least the part where she asks you why you're there sounds familiar -- PTs and LE therapists always try to clarify that so you and they are all on the same page. It doesn't mean you shouldn't be there, just that you both need to have the same goals in mind. Which at the moment you clearly don't. As for the business about scar tissue stopping LE flow, that's usually the case. Fibrosis from rads is the same, but not all of us develop fibrosis from rads, so that would be an individual matter. In my case, being bilateral, I can't move lymph to the opposite arm pit, and I can't  move it past the mastectomy scars. So ABOVE the scar I massage upward to the spot above the clavicle by the side of my neck. And BELOW the scar I massage downward clear across my waist to my groin. Does that help any? There are no books or DVDs showing this direction of massage and I don't know why, since plenty of us have had bilateral mastectomies. Just another of life's little mysteries! Did she show you how to massage around it? I sure wouldn't be discouraged about reaching a place where you can take some days off from the compression. Therapists are purists by nature, and one of their biggest frustrations is \"lack of compliance.\" But in your case, where you're obviously doing everything you can to stay in control, the usual somber warnings about straying from the straight and narrow don't apply. Perhaps she just doesn't have enough experience to trust that each individual is different, and that when we have the tools we need to take control of our LE we can afford to experiment a bit with the stated limits. As for the \"isn't that just gross?!\" scare tactics, try to take that as nothing more than a challenge to continue to advocate, not just for ourselves, but for all those with LE who have been undiagnosed and untreated for so long by the medical community. We need to get the word out so people suffering from untreated (or undertreated, or mistreated!) LE can get the help they need from trained therapists, insurance companies, Medicare, and legislative justice. Hmmmm. Maybe I'm still a bit worked up after all. Too bad! Binney ",

Doctors are so unfamiliar with truncal lymphedema that they don't readily recognize it, and even in the presence of some swelling it doesn't pop into their minds, so I'm bringing it up again here. Early stage lymphedema does NOT show visible swelling, but tingling, new numbness, stabbing pains and intense nerve pain are all likely symptoms. Delayed resolution of swelling post-surgery is very likely to be lymphedema. Trying a very short course of diuretics may be okay, but if it's lymphedema a diuretic is contraindicated, as it leeches out the fluid and leaves behind the larger protein molecules present in lymph fluid. Protein is irritating to the tissues and will lead to fibrosis formation or outright inflammation that is often mistaken for infection, so treatment of the real underlying cause is delayed and overuse of antibiotics can go on for months. Meanwhile the lymphedema progresses, making later treatment longer and on-going control more difficult. A prompt referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist experienced in treating truncal lymphedema can solve the swelling and the pain with non-invasive and non-drug treatment. It can also contain possible spread of the lymphedema to the arm. Like all of you here, I spent months looking for relief from the life-altering pain, and a good therapist had me feeling better in a matter of days. I'm not saying this is the solution for all of us, just that lymphedema can cause these symptoms, and our doctors are not going to call this one correctly. If you'd like to pursue that possibility, here are pages on truncal lymphedema, on cording (Axillary Web Syndrome) and on finding a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you. Hope it helps, and we all find a way back to a pain-free life! http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Cording_and_Axillary_Web_Syndrome.htm http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Gentle hugs, Binney Edited to add: my lymphedema started on my prophylactic mastectomy side, with no nodes purposely removed, so ALND is not a prerequisite for either long-term pain or lymphedema.",

It can affect breasts, chest, back--even the side and axilla. It can be extremely painful, and over-the-counter pain meds don't touch it. Without treatment, bras are intolerable and it's very limiting to activities that involve the arms in any way. The pain may even move around from spot to spot and be hard to pinpoint, making the entire breast (or even the whole trunk) miserable. The infections you mention are also indicative of possible lymphedema, both because infection can trigger or make lymphedema worse, and because the presence of untreated (or undiagnosed) lymphedema makes infection more likely and harder to treat effectively. The medical professionals who evaluate and treat lymphedema are well-trained lymphedema therapists. You can get a referral to one from any doctor on your team. Treating truncal lymphedema with Complete Decongestive Therapy reduces or eliminates pain and greatly reduces your risk of further infection. It's also non-invasive and actually quite comfortable. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm And here's more information about truncal lymphedema: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Please stay in touch and let us know what you discover.

MLD is Manual Lymph Drainage, a very gentle directional massage technique that stimulates sluggish lymph vessels and clears fluid from the area. It needs to be done by a well-trained therapist, but s/he will also teach you to do it. Since you've already seen a LE therapist, she may have done it during your session with her. It begins with node clearing at the neck, axilla and groin, then clearing the chest/breast, and then the arm and hand. It's one aspect of Complete Decongestive Therapy, or CDT, which includes proper use of compression (garments or wrapping), exercise, and special skin care. More about CDT, including MLD, here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/treatments_for_lymphedema.htm In the meantime, while you wait for your insurance to kick in (grrrrrrrr again!), a lot of women find some relief my wearing a sports shirt (like UnderArmor), in a size smaller than you'd usually wear (but not so small it's uncomfortable), and inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin. Might be worth a try. Target has a brand that's more affordable than the UnderArmor. Also, stay REALLY well hydrated and pause whenever you think of it for a few slow, deep abdominal breaths. Both help move lymph fluid.  Keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

If you haven't been doing self-MLD recently, now's the time to brush up on it, since it will be your best method of keeping things stable when you can't use the binder. Yeah, keep your arm movements below shoulder level for the first 10 days or so. That gives the delicate, insulted lymphatics their best chance to heal. Elevation of your arm when you're lying down and staying really well hydrated are important too, along with some deep abdominal breathing throughout the day.

This is one of those times when it's a nightmare to be without a doctor you know and trust. Aaaaargh! Good for you for keeping up with the hydration and deep breathing! Elevation will help too. If you know how to wrap, that would be the place to start with compression, adjusting the whole thing a bit looser than usual to see how it's tolerated. Short of that, I'd think the daytime compression garments might be kind of hard on your skin, yes? Have you got some old, kind of loose ones you could try for 15 minutes or so at a time and see? On the other hand, if your arms are swollen at all the garments won't fit correctly, so be aware of that and skip it entirely if the fit isn't right. Where MLD is concerned, you might start with just node-clearing several times a day, if it doesn't aggravate anything, and gradually move on to gently clearing your trunk, then trunk and upper arm, then eventually the whole arm -- as it's tolerable. It's tempting to do the MLD too hard and too fast in an effort to get that puppy back in shape, so take your time and relax before you massage, and think about \"kitten-petting gentle.\" Scratching is a danger here, so keep your hands and fingernails super clean and wear something with soft long sleeves if you can, so your skin stays covered and you can't accidentally scratch yourself. Watch for signs of infection (keep track of your temp, or any sudden new swelling or redness), and if you suspect that then you DO have to head for the ER. This would be a good time to start checking out the Therapist Locator for a new therapist near you. It might be reassuring to have some help getting everything back down. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm If it was me I do know I'd be in a panic and convinced that my arms were never going to be in control again, but happily that's not the case. Once the rash is gone you'll regain the ground you've lost to this rash. That doesn't actually answer your question, does it? At least keep us posted and please know we hear you!

If you aren't getting good results from it you could either ask your therapist to observe your technique and make suggestions for improvement, or you can use other means to keep control. We're all different, so what works for one may be much less helpful to someone else. The bottom line is keeping the lymphedema in control and the tissues well drained. There are several ways to do that, and what works for you is what matters. For myself, self-MLD has lately been less effective, and I suspect it's because I'm getting rusty on the technique and need to check in with my therapist. She's Vodder trained and goes to re-training every two years, and she tells me she always finds her technique needs tweeking every time she goes for re-training, so it's no surprise if we need up-dating from time to time too. As Kira notes, the neck and chest clearing seems to me to be the most effective part of the routine, especially if I'm fairly active and using my arms throughout the day, and it's reasonably easy to do several times a day. I also find that if I do the Lebed exercise DVD, that's almost as effective for maintenance as self-MLD (though it's not as effective for flares). But that's just me. We need to know ourselves where LE is concerned. Kane, brava! All the ups and downs you've had to deal with have at least helped you learn a lot in a very short time. Be well! Binney",

So the idea that your chest is not at risk is not entirely accurate, as any number of women here with truncal lymphedema can verify. And the good news is that MOST women do not ever develop lymphedema. Which sure doesn't guarantee that a tattoo to the breast area would not trigger lymphedema. So if you're determined to do this (and I can certainly understand why you might be) do be VERY certain that the artist you see is extremely cautious about your infection risk. Here's why: all of us who have had bc treatment are at risk for both arm and truncal lymphedema, and it can be present in the tissues before any swelling is visible (called pre-clinical or Stage 0 lymphedema). When there is excess lymph fluid in the tissues from this condition, the risk of cellulitis (infection) is greatly increased. In fact, you might want to check with your medical team for a prophylactic antibiotic for a few days surrounding any tattooing. Lymphedema is for life, so do give it careful thought.

      "Content": "Oct 1, 2007 02:36PM Binney4 wrote: Hi Brando, Trigeek and Jaybird, and wecome! You've all hit on a couple of LE truisms here. First, exercise is good for LE. Bc.org's November Expert Discussion will be on the subject of LE, and the Expert is a researcher currently studying the effects of bench pressing on prevention and treatment of LE. Naturally, because exercise stimulates lymph flow and this is a carefully supervised study, the results so far have been positive. So, yes, careful exercise can help prevent LE as well as help maintain control when used with other strategies once it develops. And secondly, you're right that to some extent it's a crap shoot, at least at the moment. That's because the more they study LE causes, the more complicated it appears to be.  When they developed the SNB procedure it was hoped that would reduce the incidence of arm LE following surgery to just about zero. While it has reduced the incidence some, the actual rate of reduction has been much less than hoped. (In fact, the incidence of BREAST LE among women who have had a SNB and rads is nearly 25%). What we do know is that overweight (and especially weight gained since treatment began) adds to the risk factor, as does diabetes. And women whose dominant hand is on the affected side (in other words, surgery on the right side if you're right-handed and vise versa) are much more likely to develop arm LE. So are women who have had past trauma or surgery to the chest. But there are other factors no one is sure of yet. Some researchers believe LE is a response to an inflammatory condition. Others are trying to explore the theory that not all lymph systems are created equal, and perhaps those with fewer nodes or lymph vessels to begin with are more at risk. It's probable that some women are far more likely to develop LE than others, but at the moment we still can't identify which are which. Another promising direction of LE prevention research is in EDUCATING post bc women about their risk and the simple life-style steps they can take to lower it. These steps include exercising -- in fact, exercise is encouraged, but so is stopping at the first sign of strain or aching, then going back to it later and building up to it very carefully. So far this approach has been remarkably effective in reducing the incidence of LE among post-bc women. Brando, in answer to your question, many, many women ignore all the warnings and don't develop LE. But there's a catch to that too: it is starting to appear that the damage done by overdoing it with a compromised lymph system is cumulative. In other word, the first time you move that heavy bookshelf may not trigger the LE, or the second time you let them use that arm for an injection, or the tenth time you fly cross-country without a sleeve and glove. But all of those are damaging events, and in some women it's the accumulation of them that finally triggers LE. In fact, there can be up to 30% more fluid in the tissues of your arm than is normal before you can notice any swelling. So at least in some cases LE is present without your being aware of it, and a single \"last-straw\" event will then make it known. Which is why we sometimes have women show up here with LE 5, 10, or 14 years (or more) after treatment. When I went through bc treatment there was no reason to believe I was at risk for LE. I 'm small, gained no weight with treatment, it was my left side and I'm right handed, I was in good shape physically and strong. Only one node was removed on the cancer side, and the other side was prophylactic. I took precautions anyway at first, but as time passed and nothing happened I got careless. I now have LE in both arms and all over my trunk--side, back, chest. I wish I'd been wiser, but I didn't know. Whew! All that just to say that I hope you'll all take another look at the risks you're running that are unnecessary. Of course this is an entirely personal decision and you must make whatever compromises work for you. But I want you to know that the steps to risk reduction are simple and not intrusive. If you're concerned because they'll remind you of your cancer journey and you'd rather forget that and move beyond, I just want you to know that once LE develops you will NOT be \"moving beyond\" your cancer experience, ever. MUCH happier to do everything you can to head it off. Here, for starters, is the National Lymphedema Network website, where you'll find Position Papers on Exercise, Air Travel, and Risk Reduction: www.lymphnet.org  As your Sister on this journey I just gotta tell you, do what you need to here. While I would never presume to tell you how to handle your own decisions, I CAN tell you for sure that you don't want LE. Be well, all! Binney ",

      "Content": "Dec 9, 2008 06:49PM - edited Dec 9, 2008 06:51PM by Binney4 Hi, Skigirl and all, A couple of thoughts: If you wear a compression sleeve, be sure to wear a compression glove or gauntlet (fingerless glove) as well, so that any swelling doesn't get trapped in your hand. If you don't have time to be well-fitted, don't settle for a poor fit, which can do more harm than good. For some hints on how to tell if the fit is right, check out the \"Proper Fit\" page at StepUp-SpeakOut.org: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm The National Lymphedema Network has position papers on Air Travel, Risk Reduction and Exercise here: www.lymphnet.org Since you can't get a sleeve and glove before you go, there are a few things you can do to help prevent lymphedema. Drink plenty (helps dilute the lymph fluid), exercise your arm throughout the flight (arm up, and do cat-clawing motions in the air), and take deep abdominal breaths several times throughout the flight (stimulates the motion of the lymph). To provide some gentle added compression, you can buy a leotard or long-sleeve sports shirt in a snug size and wear it inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin. Get a snug isotoner glove and pack it along in your carry-on in case you develop any swelling, tingling or achiness in your hand. Some women fly without any problems for a long time and then suddenly a flight will trigger lymphedema, so a history of no problems is no guarantee of the same thing in the future. Rose, do check with a lymphedema therapist about the chest compression thing. Actually, an especially supportive sports bra or cami can help prevent chest/breast lymphedema, which can also be affected by pressure changes from flying. Lymphedema's complicated! But the fact is less than half of us will develop it in our lifetimes, so its certainly far from inevitable. Skigirl, have a great trip! Binney",

For me, the thigh cuffs are really uncomfortable, so I prefer the calf. When nurses tell me that I don't need to lie down or to be at rest for 5 minutes before they take my bp I won't let them take it -- there's no sense their entering inaccurate bp's in my records. Most don't give me any guff, but I had an onc nurse once who got ticked with me. Makes me feel bad, but not as bad as a ridiculously high bp. Time seems to be a factor for them -- giving me five minutes to lie still doesn't fit their schedule. But an inaccurate bp reading sure as heck doesn't fit mine. It's hard to keep our perspective when they seem to have all the cards in their hands, but in the end it really is our arm, our risk, and they're not going to be around to help when the lymphedema develops. In other words, hang tough! Binney",

And super good for her for being such a long-term bc veteran. Give her a big hug for me. Any time you invade the chest you run a risk of developing LE. Some women here have gotten it on the unaffected side from their port insertion. Obviously that doesn't happen very often. It's also not REAL likely she'll be at risk for LE from the pacemaker, but it's not impossible. I take it she doesn't have LE in her mastectomy arm, right? I think there'd be more risk of LE from the pacemaker if she already had LE on the other side and was in the habit of massaging lymph fluid toward the unaffected (pacemaker) side. In that case she should see a therapist for instructions on how to massage in a different direction. I've never heard of anyone suggesting no bp, blood draws, injections or IVs  due to the placement of a pacemaker. Darleen might know, since she's been around the block with AC-chemo heart problems and LE both. I hope she'll be along soon with some ideas In the meantime, I sure hope your mom is doing well today and resting comfortably. Be well, both of you! Binney ",

You can find one near you (well, at least in Carson City ) by using the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. Click on the Locator, then follow all the links (a couple of them ask for your zip code and email and will send you a list, others are listed on-line by entering your state.) A LE therapist will measure both arms, do a gentle physical exam, and evaluate your swelling. If it's LE, then she'll set you up for some therapy, which involves a couple of weeks of gentle massage (called Manual Lymph Drainage, or MLD), wrapping in special compression bandages, exercises and skin care. She'll teach you to do the MLD and wrapping yourself, too. Then when the swelling is down, she'll fit you for a compression sleeve and glove that you can wear to keep it that way. Here's a web site with lots of information about LE, the National Lymphedema Network at www.lymphnet.org. Their Position Papers are especially helpful. The pump is sometimes used along with the MLD, bandaging, garments, exercises, and skin care, but it is not a substitute for them, so you'll want to see a well-trained therapist and work out with him/her the best treatment for your needs. Please stay in touch here and let us know how we can help. Gentle (((hugs))) and prayers, Binney ",

It's treated my well-trained lymphedema therapists. Treatment involves a very gentle directional massage, careful skin care to avoid infection risk, exercises that help move fluid in the way you want it to move, and compression (not wrapping like arm lymphepema, just the use of gentle compression from such options as a breast binder, a well-fitted bra that offers good coverage, acustom-made vest, or a lymphedema bra, sometimes with the addition of special \"swell spots\" that target problem areas). Additional helps include staying very well hydrated (dilutes the lymph fluid) and stopping from time to time to do some deep abdominal breathing (stimulates the thoracic duct, our biggest lymph vessel). Here are pages about truncal lymphedema (near the bottom of the page are some compression options), and about finding a fully-trained lymphedema therapist in your area. You need a referral from any one of your doctors. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Getting treatment promptly means quicker response and easier management, so you're in a good position now to get quick reduction and relief, and to be able to stay on top of it, too.  I hope that helps ease the path a bit.

It's not showing particularly good results and it's a major grind to be confined to that chamber every day. It's still in the early experimental stage for very early lymphedema and doesn't seem to work at all for lymphedema that's been around more than 24  months. It's not a cure, at any rate. Just reduces the swelling some, but there are other methods that do that too, with less stress -- specifically lymphedema therapy, called Complete Decongestive Therapy (CDT) that includes compression, a specific gentle lymphedema massage, skin care, and exercise. If your BS uses a bioimpedance devise regularly and detects fluid accumulation early you can probably skip all of that. Which is why I get so carried away about bioimpedance. Hope that helps, Binney",

The spina bifida is indeed a very sad and difficult thing to have struggled with through 15 years. And this endless treatment for BC is so draining of everything we have in us. All of it threatens the future. As much as I love the women on these boards and sharing their experiences, sometimes I think that in coming here and seeing so many women dealing with BC -- and inevitably some of them worse off than I am -- it takes something away from me. It makes me think my own situation is common, and that I'm not doing a particularly huge thing in dealing with it. So why am I so wiped? After 15 years of dealing with the spina bifida it too has probably lost its shock value for you. Sometimes I think we need to take a hard, honest look at all we're dealing with and recognize how huge it is. That way, when we try to talk to God we can bring the entire muddle to the discussion, instead of just our sense of defeat and loneliness. We can say, \"You bet I'm wiped! Look at all I'm dealing with here!\" That helps me because I'm finally seeing it the same way God does -- as something enormously sad and difficult and waaaaay too much for me (or anybody, for that matter) to handle. That way it can be God's problem too, instead of just mine. That's your beautiful daughter in your avatar? We have a couple of disabled adult kids still at home too. Getting through cancer treatment with them was so difficult, but they sure did help me make sense of it. And along the way they gained so much self-confidence, because they \"helped Mom live.\" Do look for those small gains, Diane -- maybe they'll help you see God still at work in all you've been given to deal with. Shrink, I appreciate what you're saying, and especially your honest seeking. I'm a seeker too, and I'll happily take the opportunity you've offered to pray for you -- tumor and seeking and all. I love the quote, it's spunky and up-beat. Do go ahead and speak to Whoever-Is-In-Control -- maybe you'll start a discussion that makes sense to you. In fact, maybe you wouldn't mind praying for me too. I'd appreciate it, and God knows, I need it. AKDeb, thanks for the reminder that God loves me. Nothing could be more important than that.

But he continues to update his website as he's able with current research information, in order to make it available to us patients free of charge (unlike the National Lymphedema Network, which charges membership fees for access to most of their information). He has supported and inspired those of us who advocate for awareness among medical personnel and the general public. Anyhow, he suffered a serious fall last week, has stiches in his face and a couple of broken vertebrae, and also pneumonia. He's now out of the ICU, but because of the nature of his injuries he's unable to use a computer.

I'd add to stop often throughout the day and do some deep abdominal breathing. It not only promotes lymph flow, but it aids relaxation, and that helps in so many ways! Another thought is to sleep with the head of your bed raised a bit, to aid lymph flow out of your neck area where they will be radiating (gravity helps!) Either raise the head of your bed a few inches on bricks or boards, or use pillows to elevate your upper body comfortably. Sleeping on your back would probably be the best bet, but if you're a side-sleeper at least avoid the radiated side for sure. You have a good lymphedema therapist, yes? See if s/he can help you with designing a self-massage routine that will drain the radiated area toward the other side of your body without actually massaging the left neck and shoulder area, by clearing nodes on the right side and the groin, then gently directing the fluid down and/or to the right.  Oof!

I layer some shortstretch bandages over them for extra protection when we're making altitude changes. Looks weird, but it works. Also especially important to avoid caffeine, stay REALLY WELL hydrated, and do arm stretches every so often. In fact, more frequent rest stops are really a help, to walk around a bit and keep your arm moving, take some deep abdominal breathes and remember to drink some water at every stop (and in between, too). It is SO DIFFICULT to stop frequently, but we're talking about arriving in good shape, and it does take more time to do that -- sigh! Packing to move is a whole mine field. All that hefting and lugging stuff around. And it's so hard to just delegate it all. So do think through what to wear while packing too -- maybe best to wrap for that too. You still have to be careful, though, even if you're wrapped. Vary the activity, ask somebody else to do the heavy lifting, take your time (yeah, right!) Getting good rest is important for keeping the stress to a low boil. And once you get there, unpacking is yet another worrisome time where you'll need to be aware of what your arm needs by way of a change of activity and some down-time. Accepting these limitations is maddening, especially when you've got a goal to reach, but actually all those suggestions would make good sense for anyone moving across the country, LE or no. So maybe the LE just makes it more likely we'll take good care of ourselves even in the midst of very difficult circumstances. I'm so sorry about the unfortunate circumstances -- seems to be way too many of those lately. Glad you have somewhere to land, though, and I hope the landing is a soft one. Please keep us posted.

The treatment is called Complete Decongestive Therapy, and it includes a very special, gentle massage to help move the lymph fluid out of your arm, along with layered bandaging with special lymphedema bandages. When the swelling is reduced, you will be fitted for a compression sleeve and glove to keep the swelling from coming back. Without this treatment it can become more swollen, and it can also cause hardening of the arm, infection, and loss of arm strength and range of motion. Here's a web page with information about finding a well-qualified therapist near you. The listings include therapists all over the world: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Please know that this can be treated and controlled, and the treatment does not mean any more surgery or drugs. (Accupuncture is used by some women along with the Complete Decongestive Therapy, but you shouldn't use it alone, and not at all on your swollen arm, because infection is a very real problem with lymphedema.) Please tell us how we can help, Vivo! We're here for you. Be well! Binney",

Carol, the abstract is here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23439658 The article I downloaded by PDF after a google search was another risk reduction myth-buster rant called \"Setting the Record Straight: Exercise and Lymphoedema\" that was more than a bit over the top. Just don't get this agenda. Exercise is of course helpful--for a lot more than LE--but when exercise pros skip over the top of the precautions to make such wide claims we're back to Square One with educating doctors (not to mention patients). So I'm grateful all over again for your work on the exercise documents for both patients and professionals. You rock! The acupuncture study concludes that it may be helpful for women who have access to no other therapy interventions, which I consider a strange conclusion indeed. It's unfortunately true that there are too many women with little or no access to treatment, but then where are they going to get acupuncture? Better to focus on improving provisions for treatment for everyone who needs it. And on that front we have a LONG way to go! Binney",

This is so stupid hard, and to have our loved ones not \"get\" how much it changes our lives is a huge grief. I think garments should come with \"buddy gloves and sleeves\" to fit our dh's so they can experience it for themselves -- they need more than visual cues to help them zero in on what's going on. Short of that, I sure hope the \"blast\" helped clear the air and allowed him to sort out how deep this pain goes. Otter and MOTC: agreed! -- it's a mind game, continually frustrating. I think that's what \"chonic\" actually means, though I've never heard anybody explain it just that way. But it's also so physical and concrete -- all the logistics and limitations. And for me at least, the struggle to generate the motivation to do everyday tasks that are suddenly so MUCH harder and clumsier -- like washing dishes, or even (for Pete's sake!) wiping myself. I want to feel confident and practiced and competent and creative, and too much of the time I just feel defeated. But, moogie, I gotta say, it has gotten easier over time. Not that I don't still panic (burned my hand yesterday and I've been consumed with \"watching\" it every minute since -- so far no infection!) And hopefully the loved ones eventually get smarter.  He loves you -- he'll come around. Then again, maybe it'd be faster just to let Paula and Otter have a few minutes with the man... Big, gentle (((((hugs!))))), moogie! Binney (Oh, and my life got easier when I got a long-handled kitchen scrub brush at IKEA.)",

My lymphedema is complicated by the fact I had surgery on both sides, so it's bilateral.

You will not have that problem, because you're already aware there's a risk, and you'll be alert and able to get help promptly. Getting treatment early means you will have an easier time of controlling it going forward. By far the best plan is to get a referral to a well-qualified lymphedema therapist NOW, for baseline arm measurements and personalized risk reduction suggestions.

Bottom line is, we're here to help any way we can. Please keep us posted, and tell us how we can help. Hopefully others will be alone to share their thoughts. Gentle hugs, Binney ",

Just a few words of caution about the NCI lymphedema information pages. There are some misleading points under the sections on signs of lymphedema, tests for diagnosis, and staging. The section on Exercise is similarly misleading. For a fuller and much more accurate understanding of the recent research regarding lymphedema and exercise, see the National Lymphedema Network website at www.lymphnet.org .

This kind of carelessness with lymphedema information is unfortunately not unusual within the medical world, so staying informed about new research into causes, diagnosis, and treatment of lymphedema is well worth the effort.

Yes, some of us here have had back swelling that turned out to be lymphedema. When it's lymphedema it can happen at any time after surgery, even years later. And yes, the swelling goes away, but you have to have help reducing the swelling and learning how to keep it under control. It's completely doable. Honest! I can tell you not to panic, but I'm not a patient person myself, so when I've had panicky things happen to me I haven't been very good at waiting for answers. This is an especially busy day for the docs, since it was a long weekend, but that doesn't help with your need to KNOW, so I'm really sorry for the delay in getting help. If there are signs of infection, or if you're having difficulty breathing (which could happen with a blood clot), then you need to act immediately. But otherwise they're not likely to view this as an emergency on such a busy day (because, strictly speaking, it's not). I hope in some small way that is reassuring. You really will have answers before long, and whatever is causing the swelling and pain will be addressed. Deep breaths, Meg! Hugs and prayers, Binney ",

That angle is more extreme than with normal laproscopic surgery, as Sassy so brilliantly explained, and requires careful positioning. And it does result in swelling to the upper body, including face and neck. The swelling is normally temporary, but with LE you may need help from the therapist to move it out successfully, so you might talk to your surgeon about how soon after surgery you can set up appointments with the therapist. If the surgeon uses the traditional approach you would not likely experience the added swelling (as Sassy said). So you might want to talk to your surgeon about the options available to you. It's not real likely that a surgeon would take LE consequences into account when planning procedures, as that's generally below their radar, but perhaps bringing it up to her would result in a reassuring discussion and insure that your post-surgery needs are met promptly. I think what you want is a plan that takes into account likely scenarios, so that there are no nasty surprises waiting for you. Discussing the angle of positioning and the options available for surgery, as well as aftercare, will give you the ability to strategize and feel comfortable with the outcome. LE sure does complicate life!",

It's frustrating to have to stop working, but for sure pain is both exhausting and debilitating. So I'm really glad to hear that has been some better lately. I use a WearEase camisole called a Slimmer to hold the Swell Spot in place under my arm. It's not foolproof, but it works well enough. Like you, when I'm dealing with pain I find the padding of a Swell Spot helps it for a while only. Then I have to switch it out for another kind of \"padding.\" I have a Kimbe Swell Spot from Solaris and a chest/side pad from JoviPak, as well as a stockinette-covered Medi Lymphpad (cut into a longish rectangle), and I switch out among them as needed. Here's the Medi, in case you're not familiar with them: http://mediusa.com/product/view/257/Finely+Napped+... I've had both Solaris and JoviPak night garments, which are the foam-stuffed sort, as well as a Velcro sort made by Circaid called Juxtafit. I like the Solaris best, but we're all different. They're hot in summer, and the foam-stuffed ones can be pre-chilled in the refrigerator, which makes getting to sleep easier. In winter, of course, they're more comfortable--just bulky. A lot of LE therapists don't like putting zippers in them (I'm not sure why), but I find the zippers make donning and doffing so much easier that it's well worth it. Solaris will put a full-lengh zipper in a sleeve/glove; Jovi only provides a zipper for upper arm OR the lower arm. Again, I have no clue why that is. As far as neuropathic pain is concerned, foam-stuffed night garments are WAY more comfortable than day garments, so there's hope out there! Basically it's a trial-and-error process to find what works best for YOU. Not easy, but there are so many choices now that we all have a better chance of finding garments that really work for us. Have you gotten PT help with the neuropathic pain? Mine improved considerably with a slow desensitization process. It's worth pursuing, anyway. None of this is easy, that's for sure, but I'm looking forward with you to some real relief and answers! Please keep us posted. Gentle hugs, Binney",

I've never heard of recommending a sleeve without a glove (or gauntlet) for the very reason you've discovered -- it can cause swelling in the hand.  What's the compression of the sleeve, 20-30 or 30-40? Since you're just dealing with pre-clinical LE it really needn't be more than a 20-30, and greater pressure than that is not necessarily an advantage. Aside from that, it could be a good fit but you need to wear hand protection whenever you wear a sleeve. Here's a page about correct fitting of garments: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm Actually, your garment should not be anything like a rubberband around your arm. The compression is graduated: more pressure at your hand and less as it moves toward your armpit, in order to encourage lymph flow toward your body and away from your hand. (Which is why the idea of running with just a sleeve and no hand compression makes no sense.) If you don't have a therapist and are just operating on the doctor's information, then by all means call him and let him know what you're experiencing. Be sure to stay very well hydrated always, but especially when you're exercising. Whenever you experience any swelling, stop what you're doing, elevate your arm and do some deep abdominal breathing. Do some VERY GENTLE manual lymph drainage massage, and if you've been taught how to wrap you can do that as well. Wrapping is always an advantage when flying, so if you know how to do it that would be the way to go for your trip as well. Please keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

We want this FIXED, not dragging on and on! This is a nasty surprise for you 5 years out, and I'm so sorry you're struggling with it. It does sound like your therapist has been able to get things reduced. Has she taught you to do self-manual lymph drainage massage? Are you able to wrap your own arm? Those are both difficult skills to learn (especially since we never wanted to learn them in the first place!), but it's so important to know how for ourselves. It really helps to give us back some control over our lives. In answer to your question, the same thing happens to me if I don't maintain some compression. My arm can go an hour or two without a sleeve if I'm not doing anything with it, but my chest begins to swell within half an hour without compression. You were right to remove the wrap last night if you had pain (pain makes us swell more, and it just should not be happening). If you're able to wrap yourself, after this you can re-wrap when you remove it, adjusting the bandages and foam so that there's no pain. If you haven't learned how yet, let your therapist know that it's a top priority! Once you're through with therapy and ready to be fitted for compression garments, there are special night-time garments you can get that are much easier to put on than bandaging, and a lot more comfortable too. If you're not familiar with them, look at JoviPak, Solaris, and Telesto Medtech on the garment page here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema_garments.htm But of course that doesn't solve the grief and frustration of having to deal with this chronic condition. The good news is that you really will get better at the skills you need to take care of yourself, and gradually it becomes less of a focus in your life. A lymphedema diagnosis is a kind of grief, and grieving is hard work. Do be gentle to yourself while you regain control. I'm glad you found us, and I sure hope you'll feel supported and comfortable here.  It gets better, honest! Binney",

Here's information on cellulitis: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm Cellulitis is a skin infection that can occur without any nodes removed, and in fact it needn't be connected with breast cancer at all. It does have a complicated relationship with lymphedema, though. First off, a cellulitis infection can trigger lymphedema if the lymph system is already compromised. And secondly, lymphedema (whether diagnosed or still undiagnosed) results in stagnant lymph fluid in the tissues. It's protein rich and warm, which makes it a perfect bacteria breeding ground. So any skin break (even micro-breaks from dry skin) that allows bacteria to enter can result in cellulitis. Sometimes cellulitis happens with no known break, though--it's a sneaky bugger! Lymphedema can occur with any breast surgery, nodes or not, though node removal raises the statistical risk. Even women without cancer who have breast augmentation or reduction surgery can develop lymphedema. And it can be present initially with no swelling. So, while I have not had cellulitis on my prophylactic side, I do have lymphedema on that side as well as the cancer side. And lymphedema can predispose us to cellulitis. Or cellulitis can trigger lymphedema. Or (and hopefully this will be your case!) cellulitis can just happen and have nothing whatever to do with lymphedema. Hope that helps some. Rest and no therapy for now sounds like a good plan. Be sure to stay really well hydrated, and remembering to take a few deep abdominal breaths every so often will help too (it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies). Elevate your LE arm with pillows, rest up, stay in touch with the doctor, and GET WELL SOON! Keep us posted! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Tonight on a pillow while you sleep. Also drink LOTS--sounds counterintuitive, but it dilutes the lymph fluid and helps it flow. Deep abdominal breathing whenever you think of it--helps stimulate the largest lymph vessel in your body. Try not to use that arm/hand for much, especially nothing heavy. You don't say how you traveled, but both air travel and long car trips can aggravate lymphedema. Any chance you could get a long-sleeve sports shirt (like UnderArmour) before your trip home? Get it in a size smaller than you'd normally wear, and wear it inside-out so the seams don't irritate your skin. Try it on and be sure it's not digging into your arm pit. For your hand, an isotoner therapeutic glove can help, or even those \"craft gloves\" they sell at craft stores for women with arthritis. Anything that adds some compression to your hand without irritating anything. NSAIDs aren't good for lymphedema, as they encourage swelling, so no loss there. Since there's pain involved be sure to watch for any signs of infection and GET HELP AT ONCE. Obviously you don't want to make an ER trip at this point, but if you suspect infection DO IT ANYWAY. Here's information about infection with lymphedema: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm Oh, and in answer to your question, yes, many of us have had trouble with flares when we're sick.

The \"fat caterpillar\" incision is possibly just normal healing for now. Cording runs down the arm, from axilla to the base of the thumb, though it may only be noticeable in the axilla or elbow. Another kind of \"cording\" called Mondors can run from under the breast down the rib cage. But yours sounds like neither of those, so that's a good thing.

But because she has not followed her patients over that time, she in fact has no way of ascertaining whether any of them have developed \"referrant lymphedema\" (lymphedema in the lower extremities, abdomen or genitals as a result of removing nodes from the groin). She did publish a small and short-term study early on with a few selected patients, but the validity of that study is naturally in question for all those reasons (and others): small, short-term, selected participants. Just as my own breast surgeon still insists none of his patients has ever developed LE from his breast surgery (?!), so any surgeon can make claims of total patient safety and surgical efficacy as long as they don't look at their actual patients. Just a thought. Bottom line is, we're fortunate to have Trisha posting her experience here so we can all follow her process and outcome. That (along with solid research) is an amazing way to learn what we can expect from new treatment ideas. Be well! Binney",

Head and neck cancer has a very high risk of lymphedema in the face and neck. Any damage to the neck nodes would carry some risk, though whether a surgeon would know whether their patients developed it is questionable. It would depend on who the patient saw about the swelling, which might well not be the surgeon (especially since the surgeon couldn't do anything about it). One thing to be aware of with head/neck LE risk is that the swelling can be internal as well as external, in the mouth and epiglottis, interfering with swallowing, eating and talking--sometimes even with breathing. The results of a recent study of LE following treatment for head/neck cancer showed a rate of around 75% who developed some form of it, either external or internal or both: Prevalence of secondary lymphedema in patients with head and neck cancer: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802897 Considering such statistics, and the devastation of a head/neck LE diagnosis, you have to wonder why these surgeons are so willing to dismiss the risk. It's treatable by CDT, just like arm and truncal is, but not every LE therapist has experience with head/neck LE and obviously it would be helpful to find one who does. There are both day and night garments available for head and neck LE. Here, for instance, are some nighttime neck and face swelling solutions: http://www.jovipak.com/head.html Hope that helps.

I dropped a glove under the table at a restaurant (I'd taken it off to eat a messy BLT) and didn't realize it was missing until I got out to the car. By the time I went back in to find it there way a new party seated at the table and I had to crawl around among their feet looking for the stupid thing. (Just glad it wasn't my prosthesis instead! ) Awhile back NPat left her glove on her desk at work (she's a Nurse Practitioner) and a \"thoughtful\" co-worker cleaned off her desk for her, assuming the wadded up thing was just a dirty bandage. Expensive mistake! Along the same line, yesterday I glued my stupid glove to my finger with super glue. (How did I get it off, you ask? I couldn't pull the glove off my finger with my other hand because unfortunately I'd gotten glue on that hand too. So I pulled it away from my skin with my teeth and ended up with superglue all over my upper lip. Ouchie! As for the glove, I don't think it's going to soften up any, but I'm soaking it and hoping for the best.) I do love otter's solution of knowing how to wrap so we've always got a fall-back position. (Or I suppose we could just take better care of garments... Not gonna happen!) Thank goodness for the kindness of near-strangers! Hugs! Binney",

Contact him at lymphactivist@aol.com and explain your situation. Last month Alyjens posted this information about organizations that will help with purchasing LE garments in her home state of jennsylvania. Since many of them  are national organizations, you can contact all of them and see what they might offer or suggest. Here's her post from last month, and I really hope you connect with some concrete help real soon! Let us know what you discover!

So use a gentle sunscreen that you've already tested on your other arm to make sure it agrees with you. There's a new bug spray that goes on dry (\"Off!\" maybe?) that ought to work well OVER the sleeve and glove. Haven't tried it. Avon Skin-so-soft directly on your arm works too. To tell you the truth, I find long-sleeved shirts a whole lot easier and less messy, so that's my plan of attack, but then fancy occasions aren't exactly long-sleeve-shirt friendly. (Don't just go without the garments, though, as the warm weather will aggravate the swelling and make you crazy.)

Yes, many of us here have truncal lymphedema. Here's a web page about it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Near the bottom of that page you'll find lots of options for breast compression, so hopefully your mom will be able to find something more comfortable. It's true that pain can make her condition worse (since pain causes our body to send more lymph fluid to the area), so a poorly fitting bra can definitely cause trouble. But what your mom needs most is to get an appointment with a well-trained lymphedema therapist, who is the medical professional that treats lymphedema. Doctors often know very little about this (it's outside their field of specialty), so it will probably be up to you to locate a qualified therapist. Then a referral from and one of your mom's doctors should have her on your way to some real relief! Here's a page about finding a well-qualified therapist in your area: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm The therapist will do measurements, evaluate the stage of the lymphedema, and begin treatment, which includes a couple of weeks of very gentle daily massage (called Manual Lymph Drainage) of the neck, breast, arm and back to move fluid out of the area. Then the gentle compression of a well-fitted bra or cami (and perhaps a \"swell spot\" or two if needed) will keep the swelling, pain and infection risk under control. The therapist will teach your mom (and you too, if you're able to attend with her) to do the massage herself, so that she can use it daily to keep the swelling down. Hope that helps. I sure do hear you about your mom being discouraged -- bet you are too. But it'll be good, Hope. Tell your mom we're all here for her! Very gentle hugs, Binney",

This is not about comparisons to other clients. Any company you deal with should be treating you as though you're their most important, most serious client. That's just basic. A statement like that about them dealing with \"more serious\" problems is maddening, but they simply have no notion how serious a medical problem LE is -- and how much their incompetence can mean to it. Don't mail it back, TAKE it back. You're right that mailing is a waste of time you need. The reason Gottfried can't help you is because it was the fitters' error -- if they take it back from you and fix it, they won't get paid for the extra work the fitter created for them. If the fitter sends it back, then the company he works for has to eat the full cost of their error. And they should. One thing you CAN do is let Gottfried know about your experience with this fitter, and ask them to recommend one near you that they trust. Not only should your dealer (and your insurance company) fix the fit, but they should also fix the color. These are EXTREMELY expensive little accessories, so there's absolutely no excuse for you to have something you didn't order. Black in important; their lying about that being the only color doesn't make it so. That said, are you sure your garments are Gottfried? There are other makers whose garments do not come in colors, and if they ordered from one of them the maker won't be able to help with color. BUT if you ordered black when they fitted you, and they didn't tell you they didn't come in black, then you might be able to get them to start over with Gottfried. I just wouldn't let them get away with anything. The fitter pays about 1/3 what the insurance company does, so remind your case worker that you're saving her a bundle by making them get this right. Otherwise they're paying big bucks for something that will not control your condition. Wish I could say you're the only one who's run into this problem, 3jaysmom, but unfortunately it's all too common. A good fitter is a real gift -- if you have one, bake her/him brownies!

Lillie needs to do more than refer patients to their doctors (who are too often not much smarter than she is about LE) -- she needs to get educated about lymphedema, and preferably about all the post-breast cancer long-term side effects, which she apparently has been fortunate enough to avoid personally. You can't be a breast cancer \"expert\" anymore without seeing the big picture of survivorship and all the side-effects of treatment that complicate it, and that's what's needed here. I would also remind us all that Lillie is still a BC.ORG \"breast cancer coach,\" and she has other far-reaching influence at other hospitals and organizations that influence the direction of both education and funding for lymphedema. So we still await BC.ORG's reflection on these issues and look forward to their ideas for dealing with both Lillie's committment to educating herself on LE, and updating LE information and patient need-to-know on this site. We're not done until no LE newbies ever have to say, \"Nobody told me!\" Onward! Binney P.S.- The National Lymphedema Network international conference for professionals is coming up in September. They offer a full-day Physician Intensive for doctors and nurses that covers the anatomy of LE, differential diagnosis, imaging, treatment and training, genetics, and current research, all taught by experts in each of those fields. It's very privately for doctors and nurses only, not even therapists may attend, so the setting is safe and comfortable -- an excellent \"teaching moment\" for our medical professionals. I'm hoping both Lillie and someone from BC.ORG's medical board might be able to attend. Great opportunity! Go for it, please!",

In fact, she has been offered expert oversight by people experienced in the field and she turned it down. And not just women from this site, but people with all kinds of lymphedema, primary and secondary, have objected to the glib and offhand way Lillie Shockney makes her dangerous suggestions. Think about it: for any individual woman who is misled by this \"expert\" advise and goes on to develop lymphedema, the tempest involved is the size of a hurricane, and no teapot in the world can contain it. Lymphedema is for life. It is disfiguring, distressing and very often disabling. We are all at risk for it, and we deserve to know our risk and the measures we can reasonably take to reduce it. No matter how you read the context of Lillie's messages, they reek of disregard for the reality of both evidence-based research in the field of lymphology, and our day-to-day struggles with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. If Lillie is trying to help us, then we definitely look forward to her seeking out the resources she needs to learn more about lymphedema. Read back a way, Sara -- we have offered to help her learn our realities, and we've made suggestions about both specific experts willing to help her and available training opportunities. That is obviously what we want -- Lillie on our side, knowledgeable and capable of both advocating and advising. We'll have to wait and see what Lillie wants. I'm not sure what is mean-spirited about expecting someone posing as a lymphedema expert to know the facts about the condition. Especially not here at bc.org, where the administrators have earned a reputation for offering information that is accurate, up-to-the-minute, and patient-friendly. I hope you'll start from page one of this thread, Sara, and consider the voices that are expressing long frustration with having to find our own way to care and treatment for our lymphedema, because sources like Lillie's advice (and too often, that of our doctors and nurses as well) have misled and detoured us.

Clean, moisturized skin and daily checks for any skin deterioration are important for all of us, but especially for fragile skin. I also agree that wrapping would be easier on her skin than garments, but what would be easiest of all for both of you would be a Solaris sleeve with full-length zipper. BUT you have to be very careful zipping it --keep your own fingers between the zipper and her skin. JoviPak makes a night sleeve in an extra-soft fabric, and if you request it they'll put a partial zipper in it, but they won't do full-length zippers (they'll put them either on the upper or lower arm, and I'd guess the upper arm would be the best place for it.) If she's wearing it night and day, order two so you can wash one. Since it's summer, both the Solaris or JoviPak can be refrigerated when not being worn (put it into a plastic bag and stuff it into the frig), so when it goes on it's cool, and the foam chip stuffing holds the cool for a few hours. If, though, she's insistent on day garments, Bio-Concepts makes garments for elderly patients (and neonates) from a fabric called \"Soft\". It runs easily, but a dot of Fray-chek from JoAnne's will stop any runs as soon as they start. Bio-concepts will also make them with a full-length zipper which has an underlining so it won't catch the skin. There is one donning devise she could also try for day sleeves that lays the fabric down on the skin rather than having to tug it all the way up. It's called Ezy-As. There's a video of it here: http://northernliving.tv/ezyas/view.php?ser=6 And for you, there's an amazing book called Lymphedema Caregiver's Guide: Arranging and Providing Home Care by Kearse, McMahon, and Ehrlich. It's available through the National Lymphedema Network or the LymphNotes website, or you can order it from any book store or Amazon. At 400+ pages it's comprehensive, well illustrated, and it gives step-by-step directions for everything you need to know. It also lists resources and has an excellent index and appendix. Loads of information and encouragement. Give her a hug from all of us, and keep one for yourself as well! Binney",

Their director emailed me that he would look into it and get back to me, but he has not contacted me again. I did send a second email reminding him of his offer to get back to me and requesting that he help us eliminate Lillie's archived lymphedema answers, but there has as yet been no action on that from Johns Hopkins. It seems to me that if Johns Hopkins would like our trust, they would be concerned about responding to our reports about the misinformation that riddles Lillie's lymphedema board. But Kira has never received a reply to her email to the Breast Center director, and the archived information remains on-line and available to vulnerable breast cancer patients. Also, considering that the powers-that-be here at BCO went to the effort of looking into the matter of Lillies qualifications as a bc coach, and writing us a statement of their intentions, it would seem logical that Lillie herself, who is posing here as our \"BC coach,\" would by now know of our efforts to rectify the situation she's created, and could herself act to remove the erroneous archives. But she has not. There WAS one post removed, which was a question regarding the one patient Lillie claimed that had developed LE after SNB at Johns Hopkins. It was a snippy reply (\"fractured her arm!\"), and that question and reply has since been removed from the board. So clearly someone -- whether Lillie herself or the JH lawyers or whoever -- has reviewed the situation and thought it best not to appear to be flip. But being flip was only a small part of the problem. Being seriously misleading is more to the point. Goodness! Such things ought not to be! Any thoughts on how we might responsibly exert our collective pressure to move this mountain of misinformation off the web? Should we approach Lillie directly, and if so, should it be through the JH site, or here as \"our\" bc coach? I hate to let this drop, especially since BCO has yet to upgrade their own LE information pages, so maybe some brain storming would be in order. Anyone? Thanks! Binney",

The study I cited above is for head/neck cancer patients, which is what PinkHeart asked about, and that's not a category you fall into.

If so, get it snug but not irritatingly so, and turn it inside out so the seams don't irritate. Isotoner therapeutic gloves can also be helpful so that fluid doesn't end up in your hand.

Whenever possible, elevate your arm -- on pillows at night too.  When boarding, I stop and tell the smiley flight attendants that I have a medical condition that requires that I drink a lot of water, and they've always been good about making sure I stay well supplied. Don't be bashful, because you want to be in great shape when you arrive, since you'll be in a stressful situation. Continue to wear the UnderArmor if you're going to be doing any heavy lifting while caring for your mom. I'm so very sorry about the reason for your flight. Prayers for a really precious time with your mom and family. Please keep us posted! Binney",

I'm so sorry, and I hope it's quickly resolved and your mind put at ease. What a puzzle! There are several reasons for swelling besides either lymphedema or seroma, and your doctor will want to check them all out, just because that's what they do best. If he's comfortable going ahead with the surgery it'd be real wise to start a prophylactic antibiotic a day or two before the surgery, so call Monday and ask about a prescription. That's because both seromas and lymphedema are, sadly enough, great places for bacteria to breed, so you'll need the extra protection to avoid serious infection. In case this were to turn out to be lymphedema, what you'd want would be some professional help lined up for as soon after surgery as possible. And the professional who diagnoses and treats lymphedema (LE) is a specially trained lymphedema therapist. So when you call for the antibiotic, ask if he'll give you a referral for a LE evaluation as well. Since there are as yet no state-mandated LE training standards, you need to make sure the therapist you go to has at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond his or her PT or OT certification and at least a year of supervised LE experience. Here's a web site for locating such a person near you: www.mylymphedema.com. Follow all four links on the Therapist Locator to the grad lists of four fully-accredited therapist training schools. In the meantime, do you have any sort of bra or cami that will give you gentle compression without any of the seams or straps cutting into the swollen area? If not, either a leotard or a sports shirt (the \"body armor\" type that bike racers wear, y'know?) may be helpful in controling any further swelling and providing you with more comfortable support. Try it one size smaller than you'd normally wear, and turn it inside out so the seams don't irritate your skin. Stay well hydrated, avoid using the arm on that side for much, or doing anything heavy or strenuous (gentle stretches are okay, and slower is better), and do some deep abdominal breathing several times a day (whenever you think of it actually--it helps stimulate your lymph system to move fluid.) Avoid hot water, hot weather, or hot compresses, as that draws fluid. Cold is okay if it gives you some relief, but not too cold and not for too long at a time. As to why your PAs didn't think of LE, that one's easy: because the lymph system is not taught much in any of our medical training programs in the U.S. (A recent survey of medical schools found that our doctors have an average of 15 minutes of instruction in the lymph system in their entire medical school curriculum. ) Obviously you're going to have to be your own advocate here. Always an adventure is right! Hope this leg of your adventure goes smoothly, and that you get the help and answers you need. (((((Hugs!))))) and prayers for a successful and un-stressful surgery next week! Keep us posted, Binney ",

I hope someone will come along who's more familiar with the latest in SLNB than I am, because I thought you couldn't do it after a mastectomy. To some degree it's true that the greater the number of nodes removed, the higher the risk for lymphedema (LE), but there are several other factors that influence your individual risk. Some we know, like radiation therapy, diabetes, previous chest/breast surgeries or trama, weight gain or obesity, and seroma or infection following surgery. Others we're still guessing about, like genetic predisposition, inflammatory process, and possibly certain chemotherapy drugs. Essentially, we're all at risk for this and the risk is for life, but in reality less than half of us will ever develop it. You can do all you need to to fight the cancer and still reduce your risk by following a few simple life-style guidelines. The National Lymphedema Network lists them in their position paper on Risk Reduction here: www.lymphnet.org You'll find their position papers on Exercise and Air Travel helpful as well. Since you've had bilateral surgeries you'll want to follow the guidelines for both arms One good idea is to get a referral to a well-qualified LE therapist. That would be someone with at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her/his PT or OT certification, and preferably at least a year's experience treating LE. You can use these two sites to find some near you: www.mylymphedema.com  (Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links.) www.clt-lana.org  (Their menu on the left-hand side of the home page has a page for locating a therapist.) A therapist can do baseline measurements of both arms for future reference, teach you a prophylactic massage you can do yourself, discuss risk-reduction strategies, and fit you for gloves and sleeves you can wear for exercise, travel and any strenuous or unusual activity. S/he can also reassure you about LE and be available for any questions that might arise. And of course we're all here for you, too! Be well! Binney  ",

Only very creative and resourceful women ever develop LE, right? I'm so happy that you brought up the color difference affecting compression. I've definitely noticed that with my garments and I sure will be interested to know if others do too. My fitter and I have wondered over this and we've been experimenting to see if it's all in our heads, or what. Here's what we've tried so far: Over time I've bought both a light and dark (black, to be exact) set of garments at the same time, with the exact same measurements, from the same manufacturer -- and I've done this at least twice with two different manufacturers. EVERY TIME, the black have been tighter than the light-colored garments and have needed adjustments. My fitter has contacted the companies to chat about this. Both were unaware of any such correlation. She asked if they were dyed before or after construction, and they assured us they're cut from already-dyed fabric and that the dark and light fabrics are exactly the same, and the garments are cut to the exact same pattern. They were not aware of whether dark garments generally needed more adjustments than light ones, but then they hadn't really thought about it. So we're baffled, but my fitter, who also fits mastectomy bras, says she routinely orders black mastectomy bras one size larger than lighter ones.  I sure would like to know if anyone else has experienced this.

Aaaaaugh! I always have to be anesthetized because I can't handle the \"twilight\" drugs, so I talk to the anesthetist and insist HE put the IV in, not some willing but inexperienced nurse. (Note: if you're anticipating a foot IV, call ahead and tell them they need to have some lidocaine on hand, because at my endoscopy center they don't normally keep it there and it took a long time to get. It's not essential, obviously, but my anesthesiologist kindly insisted -- and why should we suffer needlessly?!) Last time I wrapped both arms, but there's no guarantee they won't remove the wraps while you're out, so I also wrote in on my arms (No BP, No IV, Restricted Extremity). Over the wraps I wore the large-size G-Sleeves. Check-in was an adventure, as the check-in people took one look at me and were dripping with pity -- not exactly the attitude you want going into this! They fiddled for a long time trying to come up with a way to get the ID over the wrap and ended up doubling it to fit (next time it goes on the ankle!) For my truncal LE I wore a zipper-front Solaris compression vest, so they could get to my chest but didn't have to remove the garment. I had lots of written material about LE to hand out to everyone I met. Jobst makes a good booklet for professionals, and they'll send it to you free, and/or use the StepUp pages and the NLN Position Paper. And I yammered away at all of them to make sure everybody knew my arms were off limits. For me, the clue is not to ASK, but to overwhelm them with information about why they are not going to use my arms, period. When I'd hand them written material I'd say, \"Have you seen the latest lymphedema research news? Lots going on in the field!\" Like a cheer leader. (I know: bizarro! Hello?! I've just spent 24 hours on a toilet seat guzzling jello and I have to teach YOU this stuff?!!!) What can I say? It worked fine. And as I left, the nurses at the station were all reading Jobst booklets. So the next lympher who comes along will hopefully have smooth sailing. Home and recuperated, I sent a letter off to the hospital naming names of helpful nurses who treated my arms with the respect they deserved, and I trust that message got back to those nurses and encouraged them to \"go and do likewise\" next time. It REALLY shouldn't be this way. But it REALLY is. At least a colonoscopy gives you adequate time to prepare for your starring performance as a LE advocate -- emergencies are a whole lot trickier! Hey, hey! We'll all \"be there\" with ya'! Stock up on those popsicles! Binney",

There's information about lymphedema emergencies here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm Until the infection is clearly getting better, DO NOT do any self-MLD or use compression garments, as that can spread the infection. You should see improvement within the next 24 hours, and if you don't -- or if it gets worse -- be sure to hop back to the ER real quick, as you may need IV antibiotics. It can help to circle the reddened area with a marking pen so you can see if it's spreading or getting better. Do you have a well-trained lymphedema therpist, and have you done a Therapy Intensive (MLD, wrapping, exercises, skin care, learning to do all those things yourself, and fitting for compression garments?) With excellent lymphedema control you'll have a good chance of avoiding any reoccurance of the cellulitis. So if you haven't had good help you might want to get a referral for that. If you have a therapist you trust, make an appointment with her to review your self-care routine and see if there are ways to improve your control. Cellulitis can worsen lymphedema, and your therapist can help you reduce the damage. How it affects your working depends on how sick you are and what kind of work you do. Cellulitis can spread rapidly and necessitate a hospital stay, and that affects work, for sure! Hopefully with your prompt ER visit you'll soon be well enough to resume all your activities. At any rate, do plan to get plenty of rest, stay very well hydrated, and elevate your arm.

At least two possible problems with sleeve covers: The first is that this will add overall compression to the arm, increasing compression in your arm but not your hand and running the risk of trapping fluid in your hand. And secondly, that you'll add compression unevenly, creating a tourniquet effect like a blood pressure cuff somewhere along your arm, which will cause a flare (or with repeated use, fibrosis). Nobody needs that, so check it out first! Lunakin, thanks for the tip on the Target brand sports shirts -- I'm gonna look into that, for sure. Hopefully a bit more affordable than UnderArmor?

In fact, one of the women here awhile back called it \"Breast Cancer's Dirty Little Secret,\" because it's so hard to find any good information about it. So: LE is lymphedema, which is a blockage of the lymph system that usually causes swelling when the lymph fluid backs up and accumulates. It doesn't form \"puddles\" like a seroma, but oozes between all the cells, where it can cause infections because bacteria love it. There can be quite a lot of oozing lymph fluid before any swelling can be seen, so a feeling of fullness or heaviness or \"thickness\" may be the first symptom you notice. In breast cancer veterans, the blockage in the lymph system happens because surgery or radiation damages the nodes or the tiny vessels that carry lymph. The whole lymph system (nodes, vessels, lymph fluid) is all part of our immune system, so it dumps lymph fluid anywhere that our bodies are injured (which is why your sprained ankle swells, for instance) and then carries off any damaged cells or nasty intruder cells, to be disposed of. Sort of like a garbage truck. Any member of your healthcare team can refer you to a LE therapist. But since there aren't yet any legally binding requirements for LE training in any state (we're working on it!) you have to call first and make sure any therapist you see has had at least 135 hours of specifically LE training, and at least a year's experience treating LE. In my case, my surgeon wanted to \"wait and see\" if the swelling got worse before he gave me a referral, so I went to my PCP, who sent my onc a note requesting that he refer me(?) I sure hope you don't have to see that many people to get the help you need! Did any of that help? Hope so! Binney ",

This condition baffles surgeons and oncs on a regular basis, but when the cause is lymphedema, then it responds to both a topical anti-inflammatory and to Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). The topical meds would be a temporary \"fix\" that would not remove the causative agent, which is stagnant lymph fluid. The MLD would remove the cause (although temporarily--you'd have to keep up with the self-mld and probably some compression as well). The peau d'orange is also possible with lymphedema. Again, that should respond to MLD, especially at such an early stage. Truncal lymphedema can affect the entire affected upper quadrant, so certainly it could be the cause of the areas of fullness and pressure you mention.  On the other hand, besides the IBC you're concerned about, cellulitis is something to consider. It can \"percolate,\" sometimes for a couple of weeks, before it suddenly becomes a raging and obvious infection. So if you experience rapid new swelling, redness or pain, get to your doctor or the ER at once. How frustrating! Please keep us posted--we'll be thinking of you for sure! Gentle hugs, Binney",

For me the continual self-care is the hardest part: remembering to do massage, to do deep breathing throughout the day, to watch the salt intake and to stop doing whatever I may be doing if my arms start to feel strained (makes me mad!), always having to worry about paper cuts and hangnails, laundering all this extra gear and having to keep ordering new ones all the time (hmmm, my insurance doesn't seem to like that much either!)

      "Content": "Jan 25, 2008 09:45PM - edited Jan 25, 2008 09:47PM by Binney4 Hi, Kick, Yes, there sure is a way to undo that damage, and any damage that may happen in the future, too. Learning how to do that gives you a lot of freedom you don't have right now. But it's important to act quickly to get the help you need. Lymphedema (LE) is staged, just like breast cancer, and it progresses if it's not treated. This progression may not mean that it grows bigger, but that there is damage being done INSIDE, whether it gets bigger or not. The damage includes fibrosis (hardening of the tissues) that can further block lymph flow and eventually limit your strength and range of motion. It also ups your risk of serious infection that can lead to hospitalization, and in the later stages it leads to permanent swelling that can't be reversed. On the other hand, I sure hear you about the idiot insurance situation. Perhaps, since there was NEW damage done by the massage, you can ask your doctor for a NEW referral for therapy. It's worth a try. If the two therapists you saw before were not responsive to your need to learn self-care quickly so your insurance won't run out, try the www.mylymphedema.com link above to contact another therapist. Ask whatever therapist you choose how she can help you with your insurance. Perhaps an appeal or grievance will help. That's how I got the treatment I needed, but it took pages of documents (mostly copied from the www.lymphnet.org site above and faxed by my onc) to educate them about LE in general and my needs in particular. Also, plan how you will work together with your therapist to learn both the entire massage and the proper way to wrap your hand and arm to bring down the swelling and keep it under control YOURSELF.  Ideally you should be able to complete 20 or more sessions of massage and wrapping 23/7 with a therapist, but if that doesn't fit your financial and insurance reality, then you have to work together to speed up the learning process and also apply some major self-discipline to follow through on the self-care plan you create together. That's a tough route, but doable. It helps a LOT if your DH or a friend can go with you, take notes, learn along with you, even video-tape the wrapping and massage so you can review it later. (If you tape the wrapping, have your friend stand behind you and shoot over your shoulder so you get the same view you will have when you're wrapping yourself -- that hint comes from Andy, who used to hang out here a lot but is now moving on and reclaiming her life - yes!) Does that sound daunting? (Sure does to me. ) But it's SO NEAT to gain these skills and be able to use them whenever you need to. Gives you back the control over your own life. Kick, whew! LE is a lot to handle. When your insurance won't cooperate it's maddening, to say the least. How can we help? Please let us know! Binney ",

I keep asking these people why I should know all this, and where I was supposed to learn it, and why they DON'T know it, but they just mutter something and leave it at that. Once in a while I do run across an insurance person who knows all this stuff, but that's only after showing up at the insurance office with my lunch and assuring them I'm not budging from that spot until they straighten it out. Once they're sure I mean it (usually not until I'm half-way through my peanut-butter sandwich) they call in the mysterious person who actually knows how to get the information. But next time I need that person, they've vanished. Odd business, insurance. Hopefully someone will be along soon who's worked in the field and can lead us through this mine field. In the meantime, a few items I've managed to gather that might help. Or might not. For me, it's a perpetual fight. Anyhow, factoid #1: sleeves and gloves are both called \"compression stockings\" in insurance lingo. (Their willingness to settle for inexact language may be one of the reasons they never make sense when they talk to us.) So when I turn in a prescription for two sets of sleeves and gloves for each arm, I eventually get a letter of approval from my insurance company on which they've typed the words \"1 compression stocking\" eight times. And I'm not making this up! Item #2: Medicare doesn't cover garments, as you discovered. They DO cover them if you've neglected your LE long enough that the lymph fluid is leaking through your pores and causing skin lesions, because then with the open wounds the garments fit the criteria of \"secondary surgical dressing\", see? (I'm not making this up either -- I wish I were!) I actually know two bc Sisters in my town who have no options other than this, so they wait until their skin fails and then they can go get new garments. I hope you all appreciate the calm way I'm writing this, because it's taking tremendous restraint on my part. Item #3: Our friend and lymphedema advocate Bob Weiss is working hard to change these things, but...well, this is not a day when I need to explain to anyone why getting new regulations past Congress can be difficult. He has made some progress, as you will note in this notice on the National Lymphedema Network web site: http://www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQs/legislation/legUpdates/legUpdates_Feb2008.htm He has also offered his help in filing for reimbusement from Medicare and offers the following explanation of the process: \"FILING A CLAIM FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR COMPRESSION GARMENTS * Garment supplier fills out an ABN and gives Beneficiary a copy. Beneficiary pays garment fitter and gets a receipt. Make sure that this is the latest version of Form CMS-R-131. I have the version dated (03/08). This is important since the Section (G) Options were in reverse order from earlier versions. The option to be chosen is the only one which states in bold \"I can appeal to Medicare\". * If the Supplier should choose to file the claim for the beneficiary, they will file on a Form 1500. Ask that they fill out Item 27 Acceptance of Assignment with a \"NO\", and further place the note \"Beneficiary refuses to assign benefits\" in Item 19. (see note below why Supplier may not be motivated to file for the beneficiary). * Beneficiary submits CMS form 1490 Patient's Request for Medical Payment to Medicare requesting reimbursement for the garment listed on the ABN, and attaches receipt. Block 6 Authorization says \"... and request payment of medical insurance benefits to me.\" just above beneficiary's signature. * Medicare sends a denial directly to the Beneficiary. Denial appears on the quarterly Medicare Summary Notice (MSN). After the headers on this form, the sentence \"This is a summary of claims processed from ... to ...\". Following this there should be a section labeled \"Part B Medical Insurance-Unassigned Claims\". In the last column \"See Notes Section\" there will be a series of code letters denoting the reason for the denial. There will also be detailed instructions for appealing the decision. There is a 120-day appeal period after which no appeal will be allowed. * Beneficiary consults Bob Weiss [LymphActivist@...] to proceed further, i.e., several more denials will come down the pike before it goes to an administrative law judge... At this point I will need a copy of the MSN and I will either guide the beneficiary in the first appeal, or I will file it on behalf of the beneficiary. This first appeal to an \"independent\" Medicare Contractor is called a \"Redetermination\", the next appeal to a \"Medicare Quality Independent Contractor\" or a \"DME MAC\" is a \"Reconsideration\", and the next appeal is to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). None of these appeals costs any more than the cost of making copies and postage. There is a 60-80% chance of a favorable determination by the ALJ. In the event that the ALJ renders an unfavorable decision then we will appeal to the Medicare Appeals Council, where I run about a 50% favorable rate. IF the Beneficiary gets reimbursed after 2 years or so, the ABN states that \"If Medicare does pay, you will refund any payments I made to you, less co-pays or deductibles.\" This puzzles me. Does this mean that Medicare will reimburse the garment fitter directly? (That's crazy because it is definitely not in a garment fitter's interest to go to the trouble of submitting an ABN for a Beneficiary only to have to refund their money at a later time). You are correct that the Supplier has little incentive to file your complaint. The supplier receives a reduced amount of reimbursement from the retail price of the item, and if they are a Medicare Supplier they are required to file a claim for something they know will be denied. So they will ask for payment in advance. So as long as they are filing on behalf of the beneficiary it is important for the beneficiary to refuse to assign benefits on the Form 1500. That way there will be no refunds necessary. (Thanks to therapist Kevern Hartmann for providing the framework for this piece and forcing me to research the appeal process. I would ask any reader who discovers any errors or changes to the process to contact me immediately. Please remember that I am not allowed to provide medical or legal advice. All I can do is to read the appropriate regulations and policies and tell you what my understanding is.) Robert Weiss, M.S. Lymphedema Patient Advocate LymphActivist@aol.com\" So if you have Medicare please appeal, as it helps provide a basis for Bob Weiss to bring to his lobbying efforts. Thank you from all of us! Okay, Item #4: Here's Pat O'Connor's LymphedemaPeople page on insurance codes and various insurance practices: http://www.lymphedemapeople.com/thesite/lymphedema_insurance_billing_guidelines.htm And finally, Item #5: Here's an article that may save you some pennies at year's end -- or at least next April. It's not about garments, exactly, but it is about medical deductions: \"Maximizing your medical deductions By Kay Bell Medical costs seem to increase every year. There is a way to get your Uncle Sam to foot some of the doctor bills, but you need to make sure you know and follow the rules. The Internal Revenue Service lets you deduct medical costs as long as they are more than 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. This percentage may seem unattainable at first glance, but with a little tax triage you might just meet it. Don't overlook the medical expenses of everyone listed on your tax return. Medical and dental bills for you, your spouse and your dependents count toward reaching the allowable deduction limit. You might be able to count some medical expenses you paid for a parent (www.bankrate.com/brm/itax/tips... , even if Mom or Dad isn't considered your dependent for exemption purposes. And while it's not something we want to think about, don't forget about medical bills you paid for a deceased dependent in the year they were paid, whether before or after the person passed away. Overlooked medical costs Once you're confident you know just whose costs are covered, make sure you don't miss one. Some allowable, but often overlooked, medical deductions include: * Travel expenses to and from medical treatments. The IRS evaluates the standard cents-per-mile allowance each year, so check its Web site for the current rate (www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0... . * Insurance payments from already taxed income. This includes the cost of long-term care insurance, up to certain limits based on your age. * Uninsured medical treatments such as an extra pair of eyeglasses or set of contact lenses, false teeth, hearing aids, and artificial limbs. * Costs of alcohol- or drug-abuse treatments can be counted on your Schedule A. * Laser vision corrective surgery is a tax-allowable procedure. * Medically necessary costs prescribed by a physician. That means if your doctor told you to add a humidifier to your home's heating and air conditioning system to relieve your chronic breathing problems, the device (and additional electricity costs to operate it) could be at least partially deductible. * Some medical conference costs. You can count admission and transportation expenses to the conference if it concerns a chronic illness suffered by you, your spouse or a dependent. Meal and lodging costs while at the seminar, however, are not deductible. * Health-conscious taxpayers also have a friend in the IRS. Weight-loss programs in some instances now might count as a deductible medical expense, joining the stop-smoking programs the agency OKd earlier. But don't try to cheat on your calorie intake or the IRS. The diet program must be medically necessary. Acceptable situations include, for example, when a doctor recommends the regimen to reduce the health risks of obesity or hypertension.\" i That's all I know, and it's not much. Sorry! Insurance coverage of LE garments in the U.S. is in need of advocacy and awareness, and nobody's going to do that for us (well, except Bob Weiss, and he could use our help), so if anyone has some thoughts on how we might help fight this, let's hear it. Jinky has been fighting this battle in Canada, Bahons in the UK, and others in other parts of the world. I hope they'll both share their experiences here too, as we all need each other. Lots to be done! Be well, all! Binney",

You do have to be careful, though, that they don't try to pawn a garment off on you as \"your size\" just because it's the size they happen to have on hand. But other than that, making them responsible for the fit of the OTC garment makes good sense. No reason we should take the hit. Once we know the OTC size we can order online for better pricing and on-going service. And I agree--these are medical garments, often used on compromised skin.

Obviously you'd want to check the fit with your therapist, but for many of us here that's not an option either financially. So, just something to think about. One other thought: I too have a drawer of rejects, but over time I've found that many of them end up working for me at a later date.

I'm not advocating that everyone goes around spouting LE--we're not always up for it, and some women never are. That's understandable, and it's fine. But I do advocate that we work hard at never feeling humiliated by our garments and the public's ignorance about it. I sure didn't know anything about it before my first \"swell\" experience, and there are plenty of times when I still can't believe what a SECRET this rotten condition is.

In fact I've never heard of anyone doing it for arms, but because stockings for leg LE usually need to be a higher compression (think: gravity), doubling leg garments is fairly common. Trying to pull on a 30-40, especially when your leg is huge and clumsy, is a real bear. On the other hand, tugging on leg garments doesn't put your jaw in danger like arm garments do! I forgot to mention--and it's important--that if you're putting a second stocking on over the first, you have to be alert to any wrinkles in the first one. I use rubber gloves to make sure they're smooth and no wrinkles in either. I am busy trying to be grateful for all my garments, which allow me to control this stupid LE--but this summer heat makes it a real challenge! Hugs, Binney",

It happens.  :( Have you checked the fiber content of the layer of stockinette that's against your skin? Some gals have trouble with the non-natural fibers, but there are options available.

They come in wrist-to-axilla style and another one with a bit of hand covering. http://www.brightlifedirect.com/caresia-arm-liner-... They're actually bandage liners--made to be the bottom layer, so you just have to wrap with a couple of short-stretches over it. But some women find it's enough compression without bandaging over it. They're not custom, but they're not cheap either. Brightlife usually has good prices and they're good to deal with, but it's easy enough to shop around on-line. Just wanted to add that I've been using Gottfried custom day garments for many years, and I like both the feel and fit. I'm compression sensitive and find their fabric breathable but sturdy enough to hold up well. I don't hear much about others using that brand, and we had a brouhaha here on the board a few years ago with them, but I still have to say I'm well satisfied with the product, the fit, and their customer service. Just wanted to mention that as an option for those of you struggling with fit and comfort. For what it's worth\u2026 Hugs all around, Binney",

A good lymphedema therapist should be able to reduce the size of her arm, even now (though it will likely never likely be back entirely to normal). Reducing the amount of trapped fluid in her arm will reduce her risk of infection and further tissue damage, increase her range of motion, and feel a whole lot better, so if she's never done a \"Therapy Intensive\" for her lymphedema, now's a great time to start. (Like the denial she faced with diagnosing lymphedema, there are still docs around who prescribe compression sleeves without ever dealing with the underlying problem.) If she needs help finding a well-qualified lymphedema therapist near her, check out these two sites: www.mylymphedema.com   Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links www.clt-lana.org   Click on \"LANA certified therapists\" As for you, Pam, we all make our own compromises with the risks we're willing to take. Only you can make those decisions. The suggestions for protecting yourself can be found in the position papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel here: www.lymphnet.org Exercise is good for both prevention and control of lymphedema, but care and patience are needed to move forward with it while still protecting yourself--no straining your arms, working up slowly, paying attention to your arm and chest for any signs of strain, tightness, or swelling. Better yet, why not ask for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist yourself as well? She can do baseline measurements for future reference, give you tips for managing risk, and fit you for compression sleeves and gloves to wear prophylactically when exercising or traveling. The good news is that -- bottom line -- there's treatment for lymphedema that makes it possible to control it, and the sooner its treated the easier and more successful it is. Be well! Binney",

The process of getting payment from Medicare invariably involves an appeal process that can take ... uh ... are you sitting down? It can take as long as two years. On the other hand, it usually works, and every time one of us sees it through it helps our lymphedema advocates make the case to Washington that the rotten garments are essential to lymphedema treatment and so must be covered. The man to ask for help with your appeal is Bob Weiss, a lymphedema advocate with the NLN (and husband of a bc Sister with LE). The information you need, both to appeal and to contact him, can be found on this page: www.stepup-speakout.org/Appeal... Scroll down past the Disability Appeals section to Insurance Appeals and then specifically Medicare Appeals.  It's a lot of information to take in, but there's a lot to gain by following through on this, and it'll definitely help those coming along behind. Do email Bob Weiss so he can guide you through the process and add it to his information for lobbying for Medicare reform. Great guy. Sorry it's such a to-do, but wishing you great good fortune with it!

It seems that any surgery stimulates \"angiogenesis,\" which essentially means your body gets busy repairing the busted up veins and lymph vessels by producing special protein factors that make them regrow. Lymph vessels don't have as much ability to repair themselves as blood vessels do (and lymph nodes can't ever be regenerated). But still, SOMETIMES a recon surgery like DIEP can actually improve LE because of the stimulation of that special protein. BUT! It's also possible for recon surgery to worsen LE because more lymph vessels are damaged and more scar tissue created that can block lymph flow. (And it's even possible for surgeries like DIEP to result in abdominal LE as well.) The trouble is, nobody can predict which of those outcomes any one person will have. So as a way of dealing with LE, recon isn't something you can count on, and it sure isn't a LE treatment option! Does that help any? Hope so! Are you considering recon? If so, I hope it goes smoothly and successfully! Hugs! Binney  ",

Check out the entire forum here: http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64 I hope someone with more experience of gyms will come along with specific advice, but I'd just say pay attention to your arm and stop at once if you feel any tiredness, achiness, or fullness. Try it more gently the next day and see if you can build up to it, but if it continues to give you trouble find something else that works for you. Stay well hydrated, and do some deep abdominal breathing. Mary, I sent you a private message awhile ago. When you're logged in here, scroll up to the top of this page and look at the bar that runs near the top.

We do have several therapists registered here who occasionally post, but they don't advertise. Peter here is overstepping the bounds, and I sure hope he excuses himself and deletes his posts before the moderators have to do it for him. And by the way, just to set the record straight on this, Peter Glasser is far from being the only wholistic lymphedema therapist in the United States, a misstatement that casts some real doubt on the truth of the other half of his claim. Munchy, thanks again.

To fully enjoy it, make sure all your LE supplies are with you in a carry-on so they're not delayed or lost in transit. LE unfortunately never takes a vacation, so plan time daily for your regular self-care and some extra self-mld as needed. Travel usually involves different activities than our usual routine, which can also affect LE and may mean wearing bi-lat garments more often than you normally would. If you're outdoors more, take extra care with insect and sun protection. Talk to one of your doctors about having oral antibiotics (Rx already filled and in hand) in case of infection--along with the usual first-aid supplies of wet-wipes, topical antibiotic and bandaids for quick application in case of nicks, scratches or insect bites. Traveling can entail a change of normal diet too, usually involving more salt and/or alcohol than usual, so make an effort to stay extra-well hydrated. As for the change of elevation itself, leaving garments on for an hour or two after you land gives your body time to adjust, but be vigilant about symptoms of extra heaviness, achiness or swelling and act on it quickly. A couple years back one of our gals went to Machu Picchu, which is at some unearthly altitude, stayed there several days and walked and climbed all over, and she did just fine, so no need to worry that you won't be able to handle it just fine.

Here's some� information about lymphedema risk reduction: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_l... Generally the number of lymph nodes removed is correlated to the risk of lymphedema, but actually some of us with only one node removed (or even with prophylactic mastectomy and no nodes purposely removed) may develop lymphedema as well. Recent research indicates that some of us have robust lymph systems to start with, others not so much, and that plays an important role in the development of lymphedema. Unfortunately, we don't currently test for that, so it would be impossible to say what any person's actual risk might be. Obesity seems to be a factor, as well as age and a history of previous trauma to the breast/chest area. In other words, we're all at risk, so some simple life-style changes can be a wise way to lower the risk. As some have already suggested, the numbness on the inside of the upper arm is common following surgery and doesn't seem to have anything to do with lymphedema development. The sleeve and glove should fit you well in order to be effective. You can check that out here: www.stepup-speakout.org/proper...\u2026 Exercise and travel are two good times to use them, or any time you're doing unusual activities (like moving furniture, for instance).   Hoping you never join our \"swell\" sorority!

      "Content": "Mar 23, 2013 10:18PM - edited Mar 23, 2013 10:18PM by Binney4 Cookiegirl, welcome! I'm excited about your up-coming trip, and with all the care and information-seeking you're doing beforehand, it will be just what you're hoping for! I'm one of those who developed LE on a flight--AZ to AK. Only to discover that AK is not a really good LE resource. Kinda ruined the trip (well, not entirely, since I have grandkids there...). So I'm strongly in favor of seeing a good LE therapist and insisting on being fitted for a compression sleeve and glove for the trip. If you never need them, it's all good. If you do, no hospital in all Florida is likely to be much help with the LE itself (but of course they would be if you had a problem with infection). So it's just best to be prepared to deal with swelling yourself, and that means well-fitting garments, plenty of water and deep breathing, and your delightful sense of humor. Many of our women do start with a LE therapist during rads, and I heartily recommend it. They can't do the entire treatment because of the fragility of the skin in the radiated area, but they sure can treat the extremities and keep the lymph system functioning. When our doctors clear us for travel they're thinking in terms of their specialty--the healing from surgery or rads, say. They are almost never thinking of LE, because there is no specialty that \"owns\" this condition. The professionals in LE are the well-trained therapists. A referral wrung from any doctor on your team will do the trick. (Many therapists have a waiting list. If that's what you find, call them up and tell them you're travel plans. Beg shamelessly!) Can I just say that I think with your knowledge and attitude you have nothing to fear, for this trip or any trip in the future. The key is being prepared, and you can do that. It'll be good! Do please keep us posted and let us know what you discover! Hugs, and bon voyage! Binney",

(We can't do the \"no pain-no gain\" thing -- pain is bad because it draws lymph fluid to the site.) You're watching for swelling, of course, but even better to STOP at once if you feel tiredness, achiness, fullness, tingling, numbness, or just \"something odd.\" Stop and elevate your arm until the feeling goes away. You can try again the next day, but stop again if you experience any of those things. After exercise, check in the evening for any new swelling or other symptoms.  If you haven't been fitted for a compression sleeve and glove, that's a good first step. Wear it when exercising, traveling, or doing any strenuous or unusual activity. Stay VERY well hydrated, and stop at intervals to do a few deep abdominal breaths. Those, anyway, are the recommendations. The reality is that it's really hard to stop in the middle of a set. \"Only four more to go -- what can that hurt?!\" So try to be alert not only to your arm and breast, but to the excuses it's too easy to make! If you mean you have lymphedema and a hematoma in your breast, you might want to talk to your therapist about breast compression options and the simple lymphedema exercises you can do to help. She did teach you to do the massage, yes? That can also help before and/or after exercise sessions. Antibiotics before dental work aren't usually advised, though some people do that. Best, though, to be alert to the possibility of infection all the time (lymph fluid breeds bacteria really fast), and get help quickly at the first sign of it.  Here are a couple of pages on exercise and lymphedema: http://www.lymphnet.org   (See the Position Papers on Risk Reduction and Exercise) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Exercise_and_lymphedema.htm Healing prayers for you too, NL!

There are some researchers and lymphologists who now believe that anyone who has been treated for breast cancer has lymphedema, though it may be in a very early stage that is unnoticable (that is called Pre-clinical, or Stage 0). But what you seem to be asking is what triggered everyone's noticable symptoms of lymphedema. You sure have gotten a variety of answers! There is some current on-going research looking at lymphedema triggers, but it probably won't ever be conclusive because the triggers are not always immediate, so tracing them accurately is anybody's guess. There are some things that have been found to increase our risk: over-weight or weight gain; previous trauma (or surgery); post surgical complications such as seroma, infection or cording. Possibly also surgery on the dominant side, and there's some hints in new research from the UK that there may be a genetic pre-disposition involved as well (though we still have no reliable way of telling if we're predisposed!) Lymphedema risk reduction sounds complicated and limiting, but Dr. Mei Fu, a lymphedema researcher who is studying risk reduction measures, has reduced it to two concepts that are simpler to visualize and hold in our chemo-brains: PROMOTE lymph flow, and PROTECT the at-risk area from injury or infection.  Details here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm The idea is not to limit your life but to be aware of possible triggers, take the precautions you need to, and then get on with your life. A good lymphedema therapist can help by taking baseline arm measurements for future reference and giving you the skills you need to move on without fear.

We're all entirely paranoid when we're going through this bc journey, so you sound perfectly normal! Gosh, you're so on top of this -- that's pretty amazing. Do take a moment to pat yourself on the back -- well, or as close as you can get to it! Do take it a bit easier. Helping your daughter pack for college a week after AND should probably be limited to giving orders and making suggestions. Keep that water glass handy and keep on sippin'. And DO call and get a preventive visit with a well-trained LE therapist. S/he can do baseline measurements for future reference, teach you a bit of preventive LE massage, give you some hints for risk reduction, and fit you for a glove and sleeve to wear when traveling or exercising. Or packing, for that matter! With an AND there's some insult to your nerves, which alone can cause the symptoms you describe. But to be on the safe side, try keeping your arm elevated whenever you can (including on a pillow at night), drink plenty of water, exercise gently but often, and stop from time to time to do some deep abdominal breathing (helps stimulate lymph flow). If you have a tightish long-sleeved leo or sports shirt (the body-armor type), wear that (inside out so the seams won't irritate your skin) to add a bit of gentle compression if it's comfortable and doesn't bug your incision site. Either cool or warm showers, with gentle stretching, can help. But avoid anything hot (including being outdoors in the middle of the day if you live where it's summer). Hooray for your daughter who's off to college! Is this her first year? Hope it's not TOO far away. What an amazing adventure to be lauching her on -- give her my best. And the same to you too!

From your description it's not sounding like a numbness or nerve tingling from regeneration problem, yes? As Ann suggests it sounds a whole lot like truncal lymphedema. The cording is also an indication of possible lymphedema, as cording is yet another risk factor for it (the cord itself is made up in part of lymph tissue). Good news: there's treatment, and it relieves both the puffiness and the pain. But the therapist that treats it has to be well trained in lymphedema (LE) therapy. That'd be at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her (or his) PT or OT certification and at least a year's experience treating LE. And you'll have to ask, because those standards are not yet legally mandated in any state. In case you have trouble finding someone qualified, check out the Therapist Locator at www.mylymphedema.com. Doctors often don't recognize truncal LE, so you might want to suggest (read that \"insist\" ) on a referral for an evaluation to a qualified LE therapist. If it's not LE, great, but even so she'll be able to take base-line measurements for future reference, teach you risk reduction techniques, and fit you for a compression sleeve and glove that will help protect you when exercising or flying. Win-win! JMHO, of course! Lots more information about lymphedema prevention and treatment at the National Lymphedema Network: www.lymphnet.org.  Big, real gentle (((((hugs!))))), Binney ",

Keep the vest for tough days when your LE flares or just feels like it needs more compression. What are you doing for night compression? A Jovi-Pak or Solaris night vest is comfortable for sleep and is especially good at reducing swelling rather than just containing it like a day vest does. In the summer I put mine in a plastic shopping bag in the frig, so it's cool at bedtime, and the foam inside holds the cool for a long time. I also use it during the day when I'm sick, when my swelling gets out of hand, and when I travel. It does not look \"normal\" for traveling and I always end up getting wanded at airports (it does have an uncanny resemblance to a suicide bomber vest), but it's possible to wear a biggish blouse over it and not be entirely conspicuous. I wear my WearEase in the evenings with no prostheses, and the compression is fine. I don't know if the Bellisse requires prostheses to work, but I sort of doubt it. Why not ask them? Their contact information is near the bottom of this page: www.bellisse.com Some of the binders may be workable for you too, day or night. Some are light and easy to wear -- and fairly cheap -- like these: http://www.breastbinders.com/Store/catalog/Traditional_Breast_Binders-1-1.html It's definitely hard to find information about truncal lymphedema, which is a lonely and frustrating feeling. But there are a lot of us here who have it, so lots of experience with assorted arrangements for dealing with it. Others will no doubt be along soon. Those of us like you and me who have had no recon are fewer, but even we can work out ways to live in reasonable comfort from the options available. Hugs, prayers, Binney Edited to add: the Bellisse site has a page of links to information about truncal LE, studies and articles. Just remember they're trying to sell you a compression bra! But otherwise it's useful information.",

Binney http://www.wkowtv.com/Global/story.asp?S=11686213 Mapping the Body Using Night Vision Technology Julia Cox had the lymph glands under her left arm removed as part of a mastectomy. Now, she suffers from lymphedema. \"It means that I have got fluid built up in my arm in this case because I don't have the lymph glands to remove it,\" says Julia. When something goes wrong with lymphatics, disastrous things happen. Things like infection, which a compromised lymphatic system has trouble fighting. \"If it gets a little too swollen, my elbow joint hurts,\" says Julia. So Julia is taking part in a clinical trial, testing a device using night vision technology developed during the first gulf war. It's called \"near-infrared fluorescence\" and can help map what the human eye can't see deep within the lymph system. \"We put a little bit of dye underneath the skin. And with the camera system that we have, we actually watch it as it propels the lymph nodes and then it ends up going into the bloodstream,\" says Dr. Eva Sevick. The device allows doctors to image the lymphatic system in real time. \"You could actually see the dye moving up the arm on this side and it kind of sat in a lump on this side but they said it did move here,\" says Dr. Sevick. It's helping them better understand the disease and how the lymphatic system works, which may help with a cure for lymphedema. If it proves itself in tests, it may also help others thanks to a new use for some old gulf war technology. Even with this night vision technology, it's hard to see clear lymphatic fluid. That's why doctors first have to inject that fluorescent dye beneath the skin. This technology could eventually help doctors identify problems in the lymphatic system before symptoms develop.

But in that case the BP increase would be secondary to the LE, and I take it that's not quite what you're asking. Really good question--wish I could be more helpful. Do talk to your therapist about your up-coming cataract surgery. Since your LE is bilateral both arms/hands are certainly at risk--for both LE In the lower arm and hand, and for cellulitis when the skin is compromised by needles. So you need a plan for how to handle both the IV and the necessary BP during surgery. If the eye surgeon can arrange to do only manual BP, that's at least better than the automatic cuffs, since they often overdo the pressure needed for measuring BP. Measuring BP on the lower leg is a possibility, as is an IV in the foot or neck (not as grim as it sounds). IV and blood tests in the foot are contraindicated if you have had blood clotting problems, but otherwise can solve the LE risk issues. Your therapist should be able to recommend the best personalized plan for you, and s/he may also be able to consult with your surgeon. Please do let us know what you discover, and how your surgery goes too! Amazing how this \"swell\" diagnosis can complicate our lives, no? Grrrrr! Gentle hugs, Binney ",

Deep breathing actually helps with a whole bunch of things. Eases stress, helps people with asthma, etc. Can be done as often as you remember it, no prescription necessary, no co-pay. Love it! The reason it helps LE (at least as much of the reason as I can understand) is that our main lymph vessel, the thoracic duct, which my therapist tells me is about the diameter of a garden hose, runs smack down the middle of us, right past the diaphragm. Since the lymph system has no pump to propel the lymph fluid through the vessels, the flow can be sluggish unless something (a muscle, actually) moves against the lymph vessels and stimulate them. When you take a deep breath, the movement of the diaphragm stimulates that big old garden hose, and you move a whole lot of lymph. With a single breath! Power! Binney ",

In the meantime, I can see why you're needing to be on the ibuprofen, but just so you're aware, the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen can temporarily worsen lymphedema because they inhibit the rhythmic contractions of the lymph vessels that move the lymph fluid along. If you've learned how to do the gentle lymphedema massage to clear fluid from your arm and trunk, that could help lessen the potential effect of the ibuprofen while you wait for some better solutions to this pain.

As Marple says, there's much she can do to both reduce the swelling and maintain her arm in good health. But it will take some real work to find the resources you need in India. You might try calling some people in other parts of India who are involved in lymphedema treatment, even though they're very far from you. They may know someone in your area who can help, or they may be able to help a local Physical Therapist learn what she needs to know to work with you and your mom. Unfortunately the only people I know about are in Delhi and Punducherry, but I'll give you their names in case you want to call them and see if they can help. Here's a therapist in New Delhi: Seema Grover, PT, CLT Batra Hospital & Medical Research Centre, Physiotherapy Telephone: 11-29958747 #3068 And here's a study about Complete Decongestive Therapy from the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education in Pondicherry: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22293250 On that page you'll see the names of the researchers. If you contact JIPMER and ask to speak to them they may be able to tell you who their therapists were, so you can call them too. You might also want to copy that study and show it to her doctor. Perhaps he would be willing to contact them himself. And at any rate, he would learn that there IS treatment available, and hopefully he'd want to see that kind of treatment available in Hyderabad as well. Here's an article on ayurvedic lymphedema treatment that combines traditional and modern medical techniques, and may be more comfortable for your mom. You can contact Dr. Narahari to learn more, and to find out if such treatment is available near you: http://www.lymphovenous-canada.ca/shleepadaregieme.htm In the meantime, it will help your mom if she elevates her arm (with support) as much as possible during the day, and at night on pillows. She should drink plenty of water (because it dilutes the lymph fluid and helps it flow better) and pause to take a few deep abdominal breaths throughout the day (because that stimulates the biggest lymph vessel in our bodies.) Please let us know what you discover, and do come ask any questions you or your mom may have--there are lots of women here with a lot of experiences like your mom's, and we'd all be happy to help her. Thank you for working so hard to find her the care she needs! Gentle hugs to both of you, Binney",

The longer term advocacy is so important. As you're looking around for others with lymphedema to speak up for a trained lymphedema therapist, you might consider including those with filariasis (parasitic) lymphedema--I think it's called shleepada in India. They suffer greatly without treatment, but can be restored to a normal life with proper care, and their voices might help convince the hospital to get help. It's physical therapists who treat lymphedema, not usually doctors. If you get to the point where you have some physical therapists in Hyderabad who want to learn how to treat lymphedema, please let us know and we can put you in touch with the directors of the Lymphedema Therapist schools here--they have sent teachers out to other countries when there are physical therapists who want to learn, and we can see if they will do that for you.

Lymphedema is a progressive condition -- if it's not treated it WILL progress. By progression they don't necessarily mean that it will swell more, but other things will begin to happen to the tissues inside. Stagnant lymph fluid will cause our bodies to develop fibrosis (hardening) as a way to fight it off. Eventually there will be skin changes -- roughness (like an orange peel) and even leaking of caustic lymph fluid through the pores. The biggest risk, though, is that the lymph fluid there (which is warm and rich in protein) encourages the growth of any bacteria that find their way into your body, and can result in a rapidly-spreading systemic infection that often requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics. You don't want to go there! INSIST on a referral from any doctor on your team to a well-trained lymphedema therapist, who can reduce the swelling (and the infection risk!) and teach you to manage it with gentle skin manipulation, well-fitted compression, special skin care, and specific exercises.

It sounds like your darling son helped you all he could, and it also sounds like he is indeed just fine! But everyone's grieving is their own, and while it's difficult, it's also precious. There is absolutely nothing wrong with your response, the lack of wailing and clutching by his bedside, or the lack of tears at the funeral. In fact, from what you've told us about your son, that was the perfect response. He was so at peace with his life, and it sounds like you were exactly in tune with him. There is nothing \"normal\" about grief, so we have to accept our own way of dealing with it. Now, of course, comes the loneliness, and the new baby who will never know her brother. Those things are hard, so now's the time to grieve and cry over them. But nothing you did at the time was wrong, so embrace it. It was a precious time and always will be. And besides, the resources your son depended on are still available to you. Reach out -- his Jesus is there for you, too. I hope the company who just came will lift your heart, and that your fresh tears here will in fact be refreshing to you. Please let us know how we can help. And give your aunt our love, too!

I'm really sorry you woke up to yet another unwelcome \"surprise.\" Sure does sound like it could be lymphedma, and the reduction with elevation sounds about right. Besides elevation, stay very well hydrated (it dilutes the lymph fluid). Every so often stop what you're doing and take several slow, deep abdominal breaths (stimulates the largest lymph vessel in your body), and raise your arm as high as is comfortable and slowly open and close your fist several times (your muscles moving against the lymph vessels near the surface of your skin help pump lymph fluid, and gravity helps move it downward toward your axilla). Keep your arm elevated as much as you can, and try elevating it tonight on pillows. Until you can get help, avoid heat, tiring your arm, or any nicks, insect bites or burns. It's not uncommon for lymphedema to start in your hand and fingers or thumb. With good help you'll see good reduction, and catching it so early will be a big help to getting it under control and keeping it that way. This is not an emergency and can wait until your doctor is in UNLESS there's any sign of infection (rapid uncontrolled swelling, pain, redness, warmth to the touch, fever, flu-like symptoms, itching). If you see any of those things develop do get help at once, because infections in an area with lymphedema can spread and become serious very rapidly. What you'll want from your doctor (any doctor on your team) is a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist.

You can wrap it up in a plastic grocery bag and stuff it into the refrigerator, either first thing in the morning or a few hours before bedtime. When you put it on it's refreshingly cool, and the foam chips do hold the cool for a couple of hours -- long enough to get into a good, solid sleep. My chilled Solaris actually cuts down the hot flashes, and for a brief moment I considered suggesting them to women without LE who were looking for nighttime solutions to hot flash problems.

It gets better as we find good and caring treatment and start to see how we can take control of it all. There has long been a fear of using Manual Lymph Drainage (lymphedema massage) with active cancer, the rationale being that the cancer could spread through the movement of lymph fluid. If cancer spread were that simple (which it's not!) and we could stop the spread by not moving lymph fluid, then you'd have to lie flat and perfectly still for the rest of your life, because the main lymph pump is muscle movement--it is going to move with every movement of your body, whether or not you engage in Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD). The MLD just makes it more efficient and easier on your body. If fact, the lymph system is part of your immune system and acts to destroy invasive cells, so stopping all lymph flow (even if it were possible--which it's not!) would be counter-productive. So the current thinking is that lymph massage is not going to spread cancer, and may even improve our chances of knocking it out, since it moves lymph fluid to the nodes for cleansing. Still, those who were trained earlier may not be comfortable treating lymphedema in the face of a cancer recurrence. Some of them compromise and do lymph massage but avoid the area of the recurrence, and that's probably a reasonable strategy. All that just to say it's not unusual to find a lymphedema therapist who will not treat a patient with active cancer. I am not a doctor and would not suggest going against your doctor's recommendations, but just want you to be aware of what the current thinking and practice is. Learning to wrap yourself is a great idea--always a helpful tool to have in our self-care toolbox. But it's tricky and a steep learning curve, and you definitely want hands-on instruction for that. The glove and gauntlet are a good idea, but they need to fit well. Hopefully the shop measuring and ordering them is knowledgeable and can check the fit. Here's information that can help you make sure the fit is a good one: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_l... Hoping some of that helps!

I do 15 minutes of special exercises most days, and I'm careful with any kind of cut or scratch--prompt cleaning and use of an antibiotic ointment--because the risk of infection is greater in an area with lymphedema. My right arm is worse than the left, so I use a left-hand-only keyboard with my computer. But we are all different, and what I need will be different from what anyone else might need. Especially if you catch it early, managing lymphedema is easier. Lots of women only use their compression sleeves when they're exercising or traveling, and how much anyone can do with their lymphedema arm differs too. Generally, exercise helps with lymphedema, because the lymph fluid is moved by muscle movement, as long as you start gradually with new kinds of exercise and work up in strength. Swimming is especially good, as the added compression of the water is helpful in controlling it. Some women find salt intake affects their lymphedema, but it doesn't seem to bother mine. I don't want to make it sound like it's nothing, because it is. Buying garments, learning self-care, remembering to be careful about bug bites or hang nails, arguing with uninformed medical folks about not using your affected arm, finding clothes that look good with your compression garments--none of that is a walk in the park. Feeling out of place with compression garment, or even the fact that our lymphedema is a constant reminder of our battle with breast cancer can be difficult to deal with. But it's all doable. Honest!

It sounds like you've already learned Manual Lymph Drainage massage, but I sure hear you on how hard that can be on your good arm--ugh! One way to deal with that is to see if your insurance will cover the cost of a Lymphedema pump--preferably a Flexi-touch because it's gentle and efficient. That does all the massaging for you, without having to strain your other hand and arm (which are also at risk for lymphedema, after all!) None of which actually answered your question, did it? I don't know if a hand-held body massager would work or not, but probably not, since the specific hand movements and the direction of pressure are important to Manual Lymph Drainage. If you have one you could try it once or twice and see if it's effective for you--we're all different! Gentle hugs, Binney",

In the Orient acupuncture has long been a sort of standard treatment for edema of any sort. There are two studies that I know of that are presently going on in the U.S. to determine how effective and safe it is (or isn't.) But at present there's no evidence either way. I met a Chinese doctor, now in the States, who believes acupuncture can help relieve the swelling in LE and she's started one of those two studies. She doesn't think U.S.-trained acupuncturists are \"safe,\" because she finds their training lacking and their practice lax, but I have no way of judging the validity of that belief. She was adamant that when done properly, and with the proper sterile precautions, it would not cause infection in a LE limb, but she was also quick to point out that no needles need ever be placed in the area with LE in order to treat it adequately. I'm very interested to see what the current studies show, but they won't be published for a while yet. I think what might concern me more, personally, would be the suggestion of eliminating daytime chest compression. Maybe you'd want to try that for only an hour or two at a time and see what happens, extending the time gradually if you see it having no effect on the swelling.  There are many factors that can influence swelling, from the weather to activity types and levels, so while you're experimenting with the reduction of compression use, you'd want to keep a close eye on whatever triggers most influence your own swelling, and perhaps be more conservative about using compression during those times when swelling is most likely. We all love the idea of freedom from compression, but getting things back into control if they flare is no fun either, so slow and easy, and one experiment at a time, would be the way to go. JMHO!

So, you've got me really curious now. How DO you move the fluid out if you can't massage? Are you using Kinesio tape? Is your therapist saying the damage is to your skin, or is she referring to fibrosis inside? Is this something unique about your response to the rads? And if you're using night compression, which essentially moves fluid, where does the fluid go when it leaves your arm if it can't move through your chest, shoulder, etc.? Do you only massage your right arm, then? I have chest involvement and shoulder, had rads following mastectomy, and have never heard this about rads before. When I have swelling it's painful, so I can't imagine not being able to get rid of the swelling. Aaaaugh! I'm SOOOO happy for you that your right side has responded so well, and I sure hope you're right-handed! I'd love to have only one side involved, so I'm rooting for this to be a foever-fix for you.

I'm so sorry about your reasons for being here, but trust you'll find support and shared experience from the women here. As the Moderators suggest, the pain and problems you're dealing with could well be a result of lymphedema. Your history of surgeries, infection and radiation can all, unfortunately, contribute to developing lymphedema. It can be hard to get a diagnosis because many healthcare professionals know little about� it, and then it can be hard to find a therapist trained to treat it, as it's a specialty beyond the usual training needed for PT or OT certification. If you have not been evaluated by a well-trained lymphedema therapist, that's the place to start. Any member of your medical team can write you a referral, but it helps if you know a bit about the qualifications a lymphedema therapist needs. Here's how to find a well-qualified lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified... Scarring and adhesions can contribute to post-cancer treatment pain, but an experienced lymphedema therapist should be able to deal with that as well.

It works best to take one issue at a time. 1. Never wear a compression sleeve without some kind of hand protection, either a glove (where only the fingertips are uncovered) or a gauntlet (which is a fingerless glove). The reason is that when you have any swelling without compressing the hand, it can get trapped below the cuff of the sleeve in your hand, where it's harder to get out. 2. If your arms are the same size, the sleeves are interchangable, though you may want to have two since both arms are at risk. Even prophylactic mastectomy creates a LE risk (in fact, my LE started on my prophylactic side, and remains hardest to handle on that side--no nodes purposely removed, but there's still scar tissue and just general trauma). 3. Training of LE therapists can vary widely. You want one with at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her/his PT or OT certification. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm 4. LE can start anywhere in the affected quadrant (in your case and mine with bilateral surgery, anywhere above the waist and below the neck, either side). It can stay in one small place or affect the entire quadrant, so you want to see a therapist soon for evaluation and possible treatment. Trust yourself on this: you're not imagining things, and you need to get them checked out. Fullness, achiness, tightness, or tingling are all indications of early-stage LE. Treating it promptly means it will remain easier to treat and control. 5. You'll want to consider prohibiting blood pressure, blood draws, IVs and injections in either arm. Many of us use our feet for blood draws, hips or thighs for injections, foot or neck for IVs and lower leg for blood pressure. Your call! Please do let us know what you discover. Be well! Binney",

Adequate medical care at this point is your best defense. Lymph accumulates at an injury site because the lymph fluid is the body's mechanism for hauling away dead cells and bacteria. One signal for sending in the lymph is pain, so you want to not only treat the burn but treat the pain. Burns are an infection risk, so you'll need to watch carefully throughout the healing period for any sign of infection and get help for it promptly. Here's information about what to watch for: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm To help reduce your lymphedema risk with this injury, besides the above, elevate you arm as much as possible--on the back of the couch if you're sitting, on pillows at night. Drink LOTS of water (helps dilute the lymph fluid and keep it flowing--and it helps with healing too). Pause often throughout the day to take some deep abdominal breaths (stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies to assist with lymph flow). Take it easy, and keep us posted! Sure hope you were baking something chocolate so you can relax and enjoy it while you heal! Binney",

Way too many are made by maverick therapists who prove yet again that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. It's definitely a hands-on learning experience, and the technique, when properly done, is valid for encouraging the flow of lymph by stimulating the lymphangions to pump and move the fluid along. It is effective because the lymph vessels lie so close to the skin surface--but it's also critical to use a very gentle pressure for the same reason. Lymph movement is slow and rhythmic, so it's also crucial to match the speed of the system in the movements--hard to do, actually, because we're always in such a hurry. The lymph system is a beautiful thing, however invisible it remains. As you learn more about it I'm betting you'll find it fascinating (and you'll no doubt wonder how come the medical world has been oblivious to it for so long!)  Looking forward with you to getting solid answers and a real \"fix\"!

Kimberly is referring to a special technique of wrapping with layered stockinette, foam, and several sizes of short-stretch compression bandages. But if you haven't been carefully taught and supplied with the right kinds of bandages, any other sort of wrapping would create a risk for lymphedema instead of helping it. As Kimberly says, staying well hydrated is very important, but it can be difficult on a plane, so make a point of asking for water regularly throughout. Plenty of water helps to keep the lymph fluid dilated so it flows more easily. Deep breathing from your tummy helps to stimulate lymph flow, because it pumps the fluid through the largest lymph vessel in our bodies. Exercising your arms and hands (and legs too) can also help. Raise your arm above your head and slowly make a fist and open it several times in a row. Do \"cat claws\" by bending your fingers into \"claw\" position and clawing at the air. Stretch your arms out in front of you and bend your elbow so you can touch your nose with your fingertips. Some light compression might help too -- a tight long-sleeved leotard or Body Armour-type sport shirt for your arms, and keep a pair of therapeutic Isotoner gloves handy to pull on if you have any problems with feelings of heaviness, achiness, or tingling in your hands or fingers. Be careful when you're packing, boarding, and retrieving your luggage not to tug or heft bags with that arm -- ask others to help if necessary. As soon as you can find the time, do check out some of information about simple risk reduction practices on the sites listed below, and ask any doctor on your team for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for an evaluation and training in how to manage the risk. http://www.lymphnet.org   Look for the Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm But for now, BON VOYAGE!

In the meantime, it might help to keep your arm elevated as much as possible (even propped with pillows at night), drink plenty of water, and do some deep abdominal breathing whenever you remember it. Sure hope you get good help soon -- popeye's not exactly the role model we're after! Sigh! Please keep us posted. Big gentle (((((hugs!))))), Binney",

Or your library may have it, but the Second Edition is more up-to-date than the original so make sure that's the one they have. It explains how the lymph system works, how to reduce your risk, how to do self-massage, wrap, exercise, and (my favorite parts) tells about different women and how the cope.

LindaLou, who mentioned using one on her at-risk arm in the other thread you mentioned, has figured in the risk and is willing to chance it. Having lymphedema in both my arms, I have to say that I don't think the risk is worth it, and I wish someone had warned me about that before mine developed. So -- maybe somewhat less of a risk, but still a risk. And hand lymphedema can be especially hard to deal with. We all have to make our own decisions on the compromises we can live with. Leg bp readings do run higher than arm bp. In order to establish your normal leg bp you need to have it taken frequently for a while. It is more accurate if you're lying flat and have been still for five minutes or so before it's taken. My cardio and his nurses are comfortable with this and don't have any trouble with it. If you want to have it checked on your leg often to establish your own \"normal\" leg reading, you can ask one of your doctors to let you come in (No Copay!) several times just for that, or call your local fire department and ask if the EMTs will do it for you. Then the twice-a-year arm bp won't be necessary, as you'll know from the leg reading whether it's in the right range or not.  For surgery situations I've never had any problems with lower-leg bp readings, as the anesthesiologist in more concerned with the trending numbers than with a concrete number -- but I do still like to be able to tell him what's normal for me. Your call, CS. There are no studies that confirm our risks in these matters, just anecdotal evidence from women who have developed lymphedema. We need more research, to say the least. In the meantime, my personal preference would be to avoid the arms altogether. Be well! Binney",

You will hear people speak about the effect of gravity and I think everyone would agree that over the course of a day, swelling does enlarge in areas that are more dependent (and conversely areas tend to somewhat improve at night when the body is fairly flat). There has also been some reports concerning the monthly cycle and how that influences ebbs and flows of swelling. Unfortunately, I don't think any of this is documented and I would bet that the individual variation would make a study extremely hard to do unless you had thousands of patients to overcome the individual differences. It may be interesting to ask your colleagues if the appearance of swelling changes, say, if they were outside in the humid summer all day or if they were sick and stayed in bed all day which may be more severe variations of their routines.\"  Bob, as always, you and Pearl are an inspiration!

Mrs. Edwards is hiding her swollen arm that's filled with liquid from past cancer treatment on her lymph nodes.\" Even excusing the reporter's somewhat bizarre description, this whole thing continues to rankle with me. Okay, she's gutsy and gritty and brave and loyal and all those other good things, but then how do you explain \"Mrs. Edwards is hiding her swollen arm...\"? Especially considering that by hiding it in her suit jacket on a muggy afternoon she's making her own LE worse. We all understand and appreciate both denial and the rigors of this political campaign season, but I want to reach her with the message that: a.) she needs to take care of her LE before she ends up in the hospital with a serious systemic infection, and; b.) there are lots of us out here who don't have the luxury of hiding our swollen anything, and we'd all be happy to support her damaged self-image if she'd be wise enough to acknowledge that she's unfortunately one of us Sisters of Swell. I'm thinking awareness, you know? For us and for all those with LE, especially those with primary LE who typically wait years or decades for a proper diagnosis and the opportunity to benefit from treatment. Because nobody knows about LE, and with EE's attitude it's going to remain that unmentionable, humiliating, shameful, hide-it-the-best-way-you-can legacy of BC treatment. Okay, climbing down, wounded, off my soapbox. (And bracing for the inevitable rush to her defense by ALL here, because of course we do all feel a connection with her.)

Have you been through a Therapy Intensive at all (daily Manual Lymph Drainage massage, wrapping, and specific exercises)?  If not, you might want to try that before surgery, as breast and back LE can definitely cause tightness, and proper therapy might be enough to decrease the swelling and loosen up the area, as well as improving your range of motion (not to mention your general well-being!) If you need a good therapist, here's information about how to find one near you, what questions to ask, and how to judge proper protocol: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Before any surgery in an area with lymphedema it would be really helpful if the LE were as well-controlled as it could be -- that would greatly reduce the risk of complications, especially infection and wound healing. So again, even if you plan to go ahead with the surgery shortly, careful LE therapy will be important. If you have a competent LE therapist, you can request your PS to consult with her/him as well. Here's a section on surgery when there's LE present: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Medical_Care.htm# And here's information written by a doctor to help other doctors understand and deal with LE: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/essential%20informat%20for%20healthcare%20providers.htm You might want to copy it for your doctors and present it with a confident smile -- and maybe a plate of home-made brownies! As Anne suggests, Dr. Marga Massey has been fully trained as a LE therapist and is quite thorough about preparing her patients prior to surgery. From what I've seen of her work, she will insist on good therapy before surgery and following as well. Should you decide to go with her (and assuming you can get your insurance company to agree) she may be able to suggest a therapist in your area. She's been known to call therapists and interview them on behalf of her patients before surgery and set up with them a schedule for treatment. So certainly that would be a comforting choice. But the good news is, with some care and preparation you can do well with your own local resources, as long as you can get their cooperation in working with you on this. This is already long, and I'm sorry, but I just have to add that I can taste your frustration and so hope we'll all be able to help you feel less alone and less stressed. Please tell us how we can help. Very gentle hugs, Binney",

If it's humid out and the sleeve doesn't dry quickly, that's a problem. Also, wetting it will increase the compression somewhat, so you need to be aware of that and remove it if it's too compressive. Musical, I've used Juzo's with the \"dots\" on the top cuff occasionally over several years and never have had a problem with it until one hot, sweaty day last June. The pattern of dots stayed on my arm for almost two days, looking red and threatening, so I haven't worn them again. But come Cool-off Season I'll feel more like giving them another try. Be well!

There are things you can do when traveling by plane besides wearing a sleeve. Be really careful about hefting your luggage around--used wheeled bags and ask for help as needed. Stay VERY WELL hydrated both before and during travel. Exercise often on the plane. Arm over head, make a fist slowly and slowly open your fingers. Claw the air like a cat. Bend the elbows and bring your finger to your nose. Rotate your wrists both directions, and up and down. Everybody will think you're nuts, but you'll know you're not, and besides you'll never see them again.

Let us know how it goes. Kawee, I can't wear Lymphedivas either. If your wrist and the bottom of your hand swell you need a glove, not a gauntlet, or you may end up pushing swelling into your hand and fingers. It might also be really helpful to move to custom garments rather than off-the-shelf. Any chance you can look around for a therapist who will listen to you? Gentle hugs all around, Binney",

But, for those who wonder, awhile back a number of us who are affected by lymphedema emailed Lillie with our concerns. She brushed them aside. A prominent Advocate from the National Lymphedema Network wrote to Lillie and offered to vet her lymphedema answers for accuracy before she posted them, with no charge to her for his services, just to make sure the information was not inaccurate or risky. She declined. We have offered her the names and email addresses of lymphedema experts she could contact and even, two years ago, registration information for the National Lymphedema Network's \"Physician Intensive,\" an excellent day-long seminar for MDs and RNs to bring them up to speed on lymphedema management, differential diagnosis, and research advances. She did not choose to attend. Moving right along, I contacted the people at Avon who are responsible for the site and expressed how dangerous this misinformation could be to women with breast cancer; they were surprised and assured me they'd look into it. Nothing changed. I emailed several Johns Hopkins lymphedema therapists to ask them to read Lillie's posts and tell me if they agreed with her advice -- they never answered (though for a while it appeared someone else was actually writing the LE responses, and they temporarily improved in accuracy). Shortly, though, Lillie was back at it, offering her opinion based apparently on her own individual experience as though it were actually sensible advice for everyone. While I'm aware Johns Hopkins uses the \"Ask an Expert\" gimmick as an advertising ploy, that in no way excuses their long neglect of our concerns about accurate information. Nor do their disclaimers about not offering medical advice on their site excuse this gross misinformation posing as exactly what they're disclaiming: expert medical advice. Despite their disclaimer, it does make me wonder about the liability of both Johns Hopkins and Lillie on this issue, since a lifetime of chronic disability contracted by following this advice is certainly an unfair price for any woman to pay for Johns Hopkins' advertising opportunity. So I want to register my strong agreement with Kira (and others) that Lillie needs to be relieved of her \"expert\" designations where the long-term side effects of breast cancer treatment are concerned. As for \"coaching\" us breast cancer patients here at bc.org -- until she is able to steer the newly-diagnosed to early arm measurements, risk-reduction education, and consistent follow-up surveillance for early signs of LE, she is not worthy of either the title or the responsibility. The last thing we need is yet another medical \"expert\" denying our reality as breast cancer veterans. Lillie, if you're listening, we're here -- all of us with lymphedema from our ALNDs and our SNBs and our prophylactic mastectomies. We'd all be happy to help you understand our reality and find the resources you need to become a real leader in advocating for us. In fact, we'd look forward to it. Please let us know how we can help. Short of that, though: bc.org, mods, Dr. Weiss and all, PLEASE help us clean up this dangerous and distressing act. Hopefully, Binney",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2009 06:12PM - edited Oct 4, 2009 06:14PM by Binney4 Hi, Abojenn, I'm wondering if you've seen a lymphedema therapist yet? If not, that's an important place to start, even if you're in the middle of rads (are you? I seem to remember you were talking about starting not too long ago? forgive me if I have that confused!) When you're going through rads a therapist can't massage the breast area (which is part of the total massage) because of the risk of irritating the skin. But s/he should still be able to help you clear nodes in your neck and do some lymph draining in your arm, depending on what areas are being radiated. S/he will also be able to fit you for a compression sleeve and glove to use while you're doing rads (though you may need a new set once full reduction is possible after you've healed from the rads.) Flares happen. They can be caused by something we do (go without compression, get overheated, overdo some exercise or activity, forget to use sunscreen and get a burn, fall on the arm, whatever). For some, it happens when we eat salt or drink alcohol or take certain drugs (though that's a very individual matter). Or it can be caused by changes in altitude or air pressure (before and/or after a storm, for instance). Also, a weight gain can cause new or incresed swelling. Any one of those might be a trigger for you. There's some experimentation involved, so it pays to keep track for a while until you know what's likely to bother YOU. The most important thing is to know how to deal with flares, so you can regain control as quickly and efficiently as possible. Here are some skills you need to learn from a well-trained lymphedema therapist: *Self Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) massage *Self wrapping *How to judge a good fit of compression garments *How/where/when to order new supplies, bandages, garments *Not to panic (hard to do -- flares can cause an emotional reaction of frustration and grief) It's a steep learning curve, but mastering those things will give you back control of your life. We've even had women here who admit that it's a lot less stress to manage their lymphedema once they have it, than it was trying to do everything they could not to get it. I feel the same way -- we're not waiting for the other shoe to drop, because it already has. All we have to do now is put those shoes back on and get truckin'! It gets easier, honest! Gentle hugs, Binney",

How about asking for a referral from any doctor on your team for an evaluation by a well-trained lymphedema therapist? Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm A visit with a therapist will give you baseline arm measurements for future reference, personalized risk reduction tips, instruction in a simple prophylactic lymph massage, and fitting for a sleeve and glove or gauntlet for travel and exercise.  One of the problems we face as bc veterans is that medical professionals often lack training in lymphedema and accurate information. While it's true that weight gain can increase risk, it is only one of many risk factors, many of them unpredictable. Many of us on the lymphedema board here are small, trim and fit. There just are no \"safe\" assumptions about risk, which is why a trained lymphedema professional can be so helpful. Deodorant use has no relationship to lymphedema risk that I know of, though anything that irritates your skin can be a risk. Gentle hugs, Binney ",

I'm not sure why you're worried about the abdominal LE -- have you also had abdominal surgery for recon? If not, it's not a bit likely to affect your abdomen. The lymph system is divided in our body into \"watersheds,\" with the lymph from each quadrant of our bodies draining in a different direction. Usually only the quadrant affected by your cancer treatment is at risk. The \"watersheds\" are straight down the center and right around your waist, so the areas likely to be affected are generally only the arm, chest, side and back (above the waist) on the affected side. (Sort of like a chicken wing quarter, y'know?) I'm also not sure why your therapist was so thoroughly negative about your job prospects. With a Therapy Intensive to bring your LE into control and on-going self-care (self Manual Lymph Drainage massage, compression garments, appropriate exercises, and careful skin care) you should be able to work out ways to continue working. As bygrace said, you'll need to proceed with caution and care, building up gradually and paying careful attention to your body. And you may need to make some accomodations or adjustments in the way you work. But I sure wouldn't throw everything over just yet. If your LE therapist is not an OT, perhaps a consult with one who is would be helpful at some point for suggestions on how to proceed. Frogger, I can't even imagine having to \"wrap my head around\" the LE with the surgery and chemo still so fresh. Mine was diagnosed well after treatment ended, and I still struggled to learn the MLD, the wrapping, the whole concept of the lymph system, and I had more than a few crying fits and bandage-flinging episodes. So I can tell you from my own very messy experience that no matter how hopeless and endless it seems at the time, it all comes clear later. The fog lifts and the sun comes out again. It'll be good, frogger! In the meantime, how can we help? Stay with us, Binney ",

Your therapist sounds like she's a real gift. Trying to educate the local medical community is a really great goal -- and a huge undertaking. We had a thread here recently with a bunch of different breast compression options. I'll go see if I can find it and bring it up to the top for you. Medicare is crummy about these things, though you might try putting it through as a post-surgical bra for bc rather than a LE compression garment and see if that flies. Short of that, Bob Weiss, who is a LE advocate with the National Lymphedema Network, is adept at helping lymphers appeal Medicare for compression garments, and he usually wins (though it takes time and some effort to put the appeal together -- he gives instructions at each step, though). It's a free service he offers, because he's trying to get the Medicare provision changed permanently, so it will cover all compression garments for LE, and he needs successful appeals in order to make the case to Congress. So if you've got some time and determination, please do contact him and explain your situation. That's LymphActivist@aol.com. Hope some of that helps. Others will be along soon with their experiences. Thanks for sharing yours. Be well, Binney  Edited to add that the unlikely title of the thread with all the compression garments on it is \"Jobst Surgical Vest with Cups--I am not pleased\". I've bumped it up near the top for you and added a web site from the Bellisse page you posted. Thanks!",

The medical professionals trained to evaluate and treat truncal swelling following bc treatment are well-qualified lymphedema therapists. Even if it's not lymphedema, a good lymphedema therapist can for sure help your lymph system \"sort itself out.\" Actually, our lymphatics do have some capacity to regenerate, but it's much more limited than, say our circulatory or nervous system. So it can definitely use all the help it can get. Any doctor on your team can give you a referral for an evaluation. The therapist will do a physical exam, give you personalized tips for dealing with this swelling, teach you a gentle lymph massage you can use prophylactically, and take baseline measurements for future reference -- all great stuff whether or not it's lymphedema. And if it does turn out to be lymphedema, then you'll be acting early enough to get and maintain good control, limit fibrosis, and greatly reduce the risk of serious systemic infection. Win-win! Do let us know what you discover. Very gentle hugs Binney",

But I clicked on your link anyway and was looking through the list of them and found this sentence in the description of the Thora-Thigh Spot (emphasis mine): \"The Thora-Thigh...works wonders on radiation fibrosis and disperses the ending pressure of bandages or leg garments.\" I believe the \"ending pressure\" refers to the top of the leg garment or bandage wrap, and since I (and others here) have a lot of trouble with that area on my arm sleeves causing truncal pain when it's too tight, I emailed them and asked if they had anything that would work to ease the \"ending pressure\" on our sleeves. Something discreet and not too thick that we could tuck into the top of our bandages or garments to better distribute the pressure in that area. I'll let you know what they say. Be well, Binney",

You'll want her to explain: how it works to reduce fluid (because once you understand how it works it's easier to judge if you've done it correctly); what supplies to use and how to order them and care for them; what layers to use (order, compression gradient); and the actual technique. Some women have their DH or a friend come along and make a video of the process (if you do that, have them stand behind you as they record it so when you view it you'll be seeing it from the same perspective as when you do it yourself.) Others have someone come along and take notes and learn along with them. If you have neither, then don't be embarrassed to ask her to stop at intervals so you can write notes. Then go home and practice it, re-wrapping a couple of times a day for a few days. It's a steep learning curve. Give yourself plenty of time to wrap, have all your supplies set up before you start (including several pieces of tape cut to the right length and stuck onto the edge of your dresser or table). Sit where it won't unroll all across the room if you drop it (I wrap sitting in the middle of my bed.) Be prepared to take any given layer apart and redo it -- this really does get easier with practice, but when you're learning it seems impossible. When therapists do this it looks easy: remember they have loads of experience and they are using two hands -- and that there was a first time for them too, and it wasn't pretty! Tears happen, so keep some tissues handy. If you reach the point of heaving a bandage roll across the room (been there, done that), be sure you've vacuumed up the pet hair off the floor first, or you'll face the additional frustration of picking cat hair off the stupid bandage by hand. It's harder to learn to wrap your dominant arm with your non-dominant hand, so if this is your situation, just keep chanting \"This CAN be done!\" Then you'll need another appointment to ask all the questions that came up when you were practicing and to have her check your technique and the wrap. Maybe that's all you'll need, but if you need more don't be ashamed to ask. Once you learn it, keep your skills sharp by wrapping your arm at least once a month (I try to do it on the first of every month), even if you don't need to. There is nothing more frustrating than to have to re-learn it all in the midst of a flare. Above all, cultivate your sense of humor! It really does get easier! Binney",

I'm still having trouble finding the ideal compression solution for my bilaeral mastectomy, no recon, high-under-the-arm and back/chest swelling. I tried the Bellisse bra and it just didn't hit the right places, and nothing we added to the assorted pockets seemed to help. The fabric, though, was to die for. I've had custom garments made by both Jobst and Bio-Con, from the same fabric as their sleeves. If you don't need to breathe much they're just fine , but even then they won't make them with prosthesis pockets, and the idea of wearing a bra OVER a compression garment is not even to be thought of. I even had Solaris make me a vest (foam stuffed, like a night vest) for day wear. It works, it's comfortable, but I have to buy clothes a size larger to wear it, it's boiling hot, and I look like a suicide bomber. I tried this CuddlDuds cami, and it's deliciously comfortable and actually pretty. But the smallest size is too big for me, so compression it ain't. Even if it fit, though, it'd be a very light compression. But at $16.90 maybe worth a try: http://www.sockcompany.com/cudusedvca.html Some of bygrace's Annette items look like real possibilities too, but they're a bit expensive to order with the hope they'll work: http://www.senselingerie.com/m-3-annette-shapewear.aspx And here's one that might be worth a try: http://www.womanspersonalhealth.com/products/887/Anita-1095-Compression-Bra.htm I'm currently using this Maidenform Control-It cami, which has been on sale at some of our AZ Costco's lately for two of them for $22. https://www.maidenform.com/catalog/thumbnail.jsp?categoryId=82&parentCategoryId=3&index=4 Sturdier compression than the CuddlDuds, comes up nice and high under my arms, which I need, and the straps are wide enough to be really comfortable. I wear this one inside out so the gathering strip in the front doesn't bug my skin. Other than that it's seamless so it works well. My problem with it is not being able to devise a prosthesis pocket for it. (Sigh!) So for a really sturdy cami that it's possible to sew a pocket in, I use Sassbax Torso Trim: http://sassybax.com/torso_trim.php Very pricey, but it looks great on and it's comfortable. Main problem is the straps are a bit too narrow to work perfectly, so I use one of those shoulder thingys you can clip on over the strap to widen it (got it from the TLC catalog. I'm currently considering this breast stabilizer: http://www.senselingerie.com/pm-516-3-breast-stabilizing-band.aspx Not because I have breasts to stabilize (sigh again!) but because I think a thing like this might be all I actually need to control the swelling under my arms and along both chest and back. If I make it myself I may even be able to include prosthesis pockets. We shall see\u2026 In fact, being breastless presents some real challenges for chest compression. I'm even looking at men's compression vests like so: http://www.makemeheal.com/mmh/product.do?id=33302 But then I still have to solve the prosthesis problem, and not sure how to do that. Maybe an outside drop-in type pocket. In short, if anyone has any ideas that work for them, please do post. This is clearly an area where we could use some product development. Thanks again, Jane, for joining the battle of the bra! Binney ",

But new garments are always a bit of an adventure, even after a few years of LE, so you're at least in good company here . I'm not sure about the order of events you've mentioned here. You got your sleeve and glove on Friday, but then do you mean that by evening you had new swelling in your hand? And by Saturday morning the swelling had gone down? If that's it, did you elevate your arm at night, or did the swelling just go down by itself (I'm assuming you didn't wear the sleeve and glove at night, right?) I've had trouble with numbness from new gloves, and as long as my fingertips don't get icy or turn blue I've tried wearing them for just a short time at first, working up to longer periods of time. Also, as you suggest, I've tried doing frequent hand stretches and exercises while wearing them. Sometimes those two strategies work and it all straightens out in a few days, but other times it's a bust and I take them back and have them remade. In other words, I think sometimes it's a matter of our arms and fingers adjusting to the compression, which is certainly anything but normal ! And other times it's a matter of the fit just being plain wrong. I hate making fusses, so it's always hard for me to go back and have things redone. If that feels awkward to you, too, maybe it'll help you to know that that happens a lot, and it's important that the fit be something we can live with. Heaven knows we've got enough other stuff to deal with that we don't need our fingers going numb on us! If your new garments make any part of you swell, don't wear them again and call your therapist on Monday. If you try using them for short periods and exercising your hand more and your fingers are still numb, ditto. If your fingertips are red again, or blue, or icy cold, or they look like Little Smokie sausages when you take your glove off, same thing. Don't hesitate to get what you need!

I use Solaris-Tribute night gear, which is similar to JoviPak and some of the Peninsula Medical gear (\"Opera\" sleeve, for instance). Mine can be refrigerated during the day in the summer, and the foam holds the cool for several hours. My insurance covers it (with a prescription, of course) as DME, and they last around two years or so. It's machine washable and dryable, and I believe the JoviPak is also (though I don't know about Peninsula's). I also use mine sometimes for travel. You can order an oversleeve that adds compression. Some women use the oversleeves all the time, but I use mine only when I'm having trouble keeping things in control, or for travel. You can also wrap with short-stretch bandages over them, but that doesn't seem very convenient to me. All in all they're MUCH more convenient than wrapping and MUCH more likely to be used.   Mine actually help reduce swelling, much like bandaging, but none of the companies that make them make that claim for everyone. And of course there are purists who believe only wrapping will reduce LE. Please tell her for me that not wearing a glove with the sleeve is what precipitated LE in my hand, and I can guarantee her she doesn't want this stupid stuff in her hand. It's downright debilitating. Hindsight, y'know? I also pulled up another thread for you called \"So how do you cope??!!\" that is a collection of practical ideas for making it all easier. Perhaps some of them will help. Love your big ol' dog. Simply awesome!  Thanks, Casey, for all you do. Binney ",

The National Lymphedema Network had some recent newsletter articles about surgery on a LE or at-risk arm. Basically, they said if you already have LE you of course have to make sure the swelling is as reduced as possible before surgery, and use compression as soon after surgery as your doctor will allow. If you don't have it yet and are wishing to prevent it, you might talk to your doctor about a prophylactic antibiotic, starting a day or two before surgery. After surgery keep you arm elevated on pillows. (Don't let a nurse tie it to an IV pole to elevate it, as tying it compresses the lymphatics in your wrist.) Then elevate it as often as you can for a few days after surgery (and at night on pillows). Avoid salt, stay well hydrated. Watch carefully for any signs of infection and report them immediately.  Heal, rest, pamper yourself, eat chocolate. (Hmmm. Not sure that last suggestion was from the NLN ) Be well, Binney",

Sharon, your comment that LE bothers you more than the mastectomy fits with an actual study (survey) done a couple of years ago by Elise Radina (one of my research heros!) where women over and over told her the LE was \"harder to deal with than the bc.\" It didn't matter what stage their bc was, either -- Stage IV women said it as often as Stage I. I think it's partly this public aspect of LE that makes so many of us feel that way. Jinky, Juzo puts out a brochure that's useful for handing out.

Icing could be a problem, because any extreme of temperatures, high or low, can put you at risk for lymphedema. So cooling is good, but add an extra layer of cloth or towel to keep it from being really icy cold. (You know how if you're outside playing in winter and the snow gets into your mittens, then when you go inside your hand and fingers swell up as they're thawing out? You don't want to encourage excess fluid to accumulate there by either very hot or very cold temps.) The elevation is a great idea, as long as the arm is well supported, and with no restrictions around it (jewelry, cuffs, tight bandages). Other helps are taking occasional deep abdominal breaths (it stimulates the largest lymph vessel in our bodies), and staying VERY well hydrated (helps dilute the lymph fluid so it can flow more freely).

Maybe it's because LE is such a little backwater of the medical world! I think there's a lot of confusion/controversy on this issue in the LE world, because there are no \"Western-medical-style\" studies on LE and acupuncture (though there's at least one in progress). The opinions range from \"no problem!\" to \"no unnecessary needles anywhere on the body\" since any skin puncture is a challenge to the overall lymph system. Probably the truth lies somewhere in between. A chinese doctor I talked to at the NLN conference thought any American-trained acupuncurist was a danger, but one trained rigorously in China was not! So we wait -- again! -- for research to help us solve these sticky issues. Thanks for sharing her responses. I hope this will be a long and mutually helpful relationship for you. Hugs, Binney ",

Where else would grown women be discussing how to towel-dry ourselves and whether or not to rub our poor, sore arms when they ache?!  Among our other prime topics for discussion: how to shave our arm pits, what emergency measures to take in case of a mosquito bite crisis, and how to wave while wrapped in bandages. Why, we're practically a finishing school! Anybody who already has a massage routine should clear their neck nodes before a shower and then wash and dry in the order and direction of their massage. For those who don't yet, it goes sorta like this (and I hope others will come along and offer their suggestions and routines). First, start with a few deep abdominal breaths, in through your nose, out through your mouth. The easy, casual way to do your neck is simply to do some gentle stretches: standing up straight (under the shower is fine), bend your head forward slowly until your chin touches your chest, and raise it slowly. Then bend your neck to the right until your ear touches your shoulder (keep your shoulders relaxed, though) and slowly raise your head. Bend your head to the left and up again. Do that 4 or 5 times like you've got all the time in the world. (Don't bend your head back - just forward and to each side.) Then standing up straight TURN your head slowly to the right and again slowly to the left a few times. Okay, neck clear. Take a few more deep breaths. When you soap up (or dry off, or apply lotion, or SOFTLY rub your aching arms) you can then use this order: First chest: if you're bilateral dry UPWARD above the scars to the shoulder and DOWNWARD below the scars to the groin. Dry your side and back in a downward direction from top to bottom. If you've only had surgery on one side, you dry front and back in the direction of your unaffected arm pit. (My therapist tells me it's a bit of a trick to learn to towel yourself sideways across your body, but since I'm bilateral that's one trick I didn't have to learn! ) Dry your arm like so: front of upper arm UP toward shoulder, then back of upper arm toward front of arm, then up to shoulder again. Elbow, from back to front, then up the front of the arm to the shoulder again. Lower arm, same as upper arm. Wrist and hand, upward toward arm and then clear up to shoulder again. This takes longer to explain than it does to do it, but I gotta say that drying UP my arm took some getting used to -- guess it's just natural to go down. Do a couple more deep breaths and slow neck bends, and you're good to go. It's fine to rub your arms when they ache, but again it's best to start at the top, going up, and work your way down your arm, always rubbing up toward your shoulder. And the rubbing needs to be gentle, like petting a kitten, in order to be effective in terms of moving lymph fluid. The lymph vessels are very near the surface, so heavy pressure squishes them rather than encouraging lymph flow. If you need firmer pressure to relieve the ache, that's fine. It won't do any particular damage (as long as it's not deep tissue massage) but it won't move lymph. Clear as mud?! If you don't get it, ask again and maybe I can clarify, or somebody else can. Next lesson, ladies! How to open a jar of olives with your slippery, stupid glove on...   ",

Stay VERY well hydrated throughout (helps dilute the lymph fluid), exercise your arm gently throughout the flight (simple stretches, reach up and \"cat claw\" the air, hold your arm above your head and \"pump\" your fist slowly open and closed), and ask for help tugging your luggage out of overhead bins and carousels. Wear the garments (or stay wrapped) for an hour or two after you land to allow your body to adjust to the pressure changes. Pause from time to time to take several deep abdominal breaths (stimulates the lymph system).

I think we moms too often \"carry on\" because we have to, and it's only later that our world can really be put back together. I'd encourage you to call around and see what's on offer at any cancer center near you, as a chance to talk with a specifically cancer-oriented counsellor could really help you get it \"out there.\" At any rate, I hope you'll take a few minutes to pat yourself on the back for having been the \"strong\" one when that was needed.

You'll want your lymphedema to be in the best possible control going in, so knowing how to do self-MLD and self-wrapping will be especially helpful. The women here who have had surgery with controlled lymphedema have not had problems regaining control afterward, and with the use of prophylactic antibiotics they haven't had infection problems either. Good for you for getting prompt help with the lymphedema. That will make it easier to manage on-going. Please tell us how we can help. Gentle hug, Binney ",

Do everything, EVERYTHING you need to in order to assure the bc will not come back, and after that decision is made it's time enough to worry about the lymphedema. Here are a couple of reasons why you really can't afford to make lymphedema a factor in your rads decision: First, lymphedema can be treated. Especially if you're aware of the possibility and catch it early, lymphedema can be controlled and managed. And the treatment is not grueling -- no drugs, no surgery. It's a matter of gentle (even delightful!) massage, gentle exercises, skin care, and compression. Secondly, there's absolutely no way anyone can tell you what your indiviual risk for lymphedema might be. Presumably, you've already had some sort of surgery for your bc, so you're already at risk for lymphedema -- even if it was only a prophylactic mastectomy. Some things increase your risk, but no one knows how much, or even what all the risk factors are. Rads is only one of them. Third, there are A LOT of other things you can do yourself -- with or without rads -- to lower your personal risk. You'll want to learn about them and do them all, whether you decide on rads or not. You'll find some guidelines among the Position Papers at the National Lymphedema Network web site, here: www.lymphnet.org Last but not least, MOST women who are treated for breast cancer, even with rads, do NOT develop lymphedema. The percentages may be higher than we're led to believe, but they're not near fifty percent, by anybody's estimate.  I have lymphedema. It started on my prophylactic side, not the side with rads. I hate lymphedema, as you perhaps already know since I tend to yelp about it all over these boards. But it's got NOTHING on breast cancer. climber, don't fear the lymphedema -- there's help for it, and it's not going to destroy you. Do what you need to do to fight the real beast. Big hugs, and prayers for peace with your rads decision -- these things are so difficult! Binney ",

A lot of us have had trouble getting this diagnosis straight, so you're not alone! Our doctors often don't know much about lymphedema, as it's not their field of expertise, and unfortunately it's not a subject that's taught much in our medical schools. The medical expert you need to see in order to get a straight diagnosis would be a well-qualified lymphedema therapist. You can find one near you by following the links on the Therapist Locator, here: www.mylymphedema.com. You'll need a referral from any one of your doctors: your onc, rads onc, PCP, surgeon, or plastic surgeon, so find the one most able to help you with this. The therapist will measure your arms, take your medical history, and do a physical exam to diagnose it, without any invasive tests being required. The test that Tina mentions, lymphoscintigraphy, is not usually used for routine diagnoses like those following breast cancer treatment. The injected dye can cause temporary problems with lymph flow that can worsen swelling, and of course any injection into areas affected by lymphedema presents an infection risk. The test is more often used when the diagnosis is unclear because the swelling in a limb has no clear causative factor such as breast cancer, or when standard lymphedema therapy doesn't work. So your first step needs to be a referral for evaluation by a trained and experienced lymphedema therapist. And the sooner the better! I'm sorry all the doctors' waffling has caused you so much stress, but hopefully you'll soon have the information you need. Please let us know what you discover. Be well! Binney ",

As a woman with lymphedema I can agree with you that it is a quality of life issue. Of course you're fearful of it -- we all were. But there are two other factors you'll want to take into consideration. First, even with ALND and rads, the fact is that most women never develop lymphedema. It is not currently possible to predict who will and who won't, but even if you needed extensive node removal and several fields of rads, that's no guarantee you'd ever have to cope with it. And second, any bc treatment creates a lymphedema risk. It's a fact of our lives from here on out, all of us. There are plenty of simple life-style adjustments you can make that will significantly reduce that risk without affecting QOL. I wish I'd known about them and been warned to take those simple precautions. But the fact is, if you do develop lymphedema as I have (both arms, both hands, both sides of my chest, with a single node removed on one side and a prophylactic mastectomy on the other), it's still entirely possible to live fully, gratefully, and well. Those, too, are choices we have the right to make for ourselves. You must feel so trapped and paralysed -- I remember that feeling and the grief that overwhelmed me as I tried to make the best decisions for me. Please know as you tussle with this that you're not alone. Hugs, prayers, Binney",

In fact, the forced division of labor has been good for everyone in the family, pushing some responsibility onto the kids that I wouldn't have thought to give them before. We're all growing up! 5.)  I can't believe my great good fortune in knowing all the women I've met here on this LE board.

In Germany they do wrapping of patients in a group setting and then they all exercise together to aid the motivation.)  In fact, that's the beauty of wrapping -- it helps your lymph system pump fluid out of there in response to movement and exertion. You will be amazed at the way it works, MOTC. With good management you'll begin to see results within the first couple of days (often Day 1!)

A year ago I spoke to Dr. Barbara Pockaj at Mayo here in Phoenix about a trial she was doing strictly for bc treatment, using Avastin immediately following surgery in women with early stage bc. She's a surgeon, but unusually savvy about LE, so I asked her if in their study they'd be looking at rate of LE development, since Avastin inhibits growth of vessels (both blood and lymphatic, according to her and to the scientists at the U.of A. who concern themselves with VEGF). Compared to blood vessels, lymph vessels apparently have a limited ability to regenerate, and the time period for regeneration after trauma is also limited, so immediate use of Avastin could theoretically raise the incidence of LE, though later use of the drug may have no effect (or even a beneficial effect for the reasons hypothesized in the study outline). For that reason she worked out some extra funding to add rate of LE development to their study, but it'll be some time before we know the outcome of that. The anecdotal experience with Avastin having a positive effect on LE is compelling, and I'm glad they're planning to study it (though I haven't volunteered) So perhaps the timing here is crucial, giving time post-surgery or post-rads for whatever regeneration will take place before starting the drug. (Of course none of this has anything to do with bc treatment -- if use of Avastin immediately after surgery saves lives, the LE is beside the point.) That said, it's not Mayo that's conducting this particular study, and I my familiarity with the group in Scottsdale that's doing this is limited. They've been trying to get this underway for quite a long time, but local scuttlebutt has it that they're strapped for volunteers. Since everything from dosage to long-term side-effects is virtually unknown, you can see why. This one will definitely be really interesting to watch. Binney",

We're all fanatics about wanting our Sistahs who are at risk to take all the precautions they can to avoid joining our Sorority of Swell. Good for you! The bad news first: we're all at risk, and it's for life. But the good news is that there are some simple life-style changes you can make to help reduce that risk. Here's some general information about it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm More specifically, the issue of what to do about flying can be controversial. Some people advocate using well-fitting compression garments (a sleeve and hand protection), while others argue that a poorly-fitted garment could cause more problems than it solves. Since your flight is short, you may want to avoid the controversy altogether and take other precautions. Like these: When you're packing, be careful about lifting loaded suitcases onto the floor or into your car. Get someone to help.  Luggage with wheels is better than hefting it with your arms, but you still need to be careful with all the tugging and hefting involved in air travel (at check-in, TSA screening, boarding and deplaning, carousel pick-up). Plan to stay VERY well hydrated--no caffeine. This helps dilute lymph fluid and keeps it moving. Pause from time to time to take a few deep abdominal breaths. This stimulates the largest lymph vessel in your body. Do some arm (and leg!) stretches at intervals. Don't worry about what other passengers think--you'll never see them again! Especially helpful: reaching your arm above your head and rhythmically opening and closing your fist. At your destination, if you'll be outside, avoid both sunburn and insect bites. If you'll be engaged in unusual activities on your trip (beach volleyball? kayaking?), pay attention to your arm and stop at once if you experience aching, tingling, or tightness. Elevate your arm, and stay well hydrated. As soon as you're able, even after your trip, ask any doctor on your team for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for evaluation, personalized risk-reduction tips, and baseline arm measurements for future reference. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Have a wonderful trip, don't swell, and be well! (Let us know how it goes!) Binney",

For instance, a sleeve that's too tight at the wrist can trap fluid in the hand and not allow it to return up the arm. A sleeve that's too tight at the top will trap fluid in the upper arm or elbow. If your garments are working well for you on the days that you use them, then that's not a worry. Our day garments last about six months if they're worn daily (actually, every other day, because you'd have two and alternate them). They hold up better if they're washed daily. If you're wearing them only occasionally they'll last longer, of course. Barsco, lymphedema therapists can be hard to locate, as sometimes even our doctors are not aware of them.

Right, a poorly-fitting sleeve is worse than no sleeve, because an area that's too tight above one that's not-so-tight can trap any swelling in your arm or hand. There are some helps for assuring a good fit here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm But it really isn't a do-it-yourself deal, and it's always best to check with someone knowledgable. BUT, if you can't do that there are still precautions you can take to reduce your risk. Be careful when packing and traveling not to heft heavy luggage around. Use good body mechanics if you have to lift either the suitcase or piles of items you're packing in it (use your unaffected arm or both arms, and keep the weight close in to your body, not way out in front of you). Use wheeled luggage and don't jerk it up over the curbs. Get someone to help you lift it into the overhead areas or off the carousels. Don't carry heavy bags over your affected shoulder. Stay really well hydrated, starting the day before you leave at least--that helps dilute the lymph fluid to keep it moving. (It may mean more trips to that tiny stupid airplane bathroom, but at least it'll get you out of your seat and stretching your legs!) On the plane, plan to do arm stretches often to help keep lymph flowing, and do periodic deep, abdominal breathing to stimulate the largest lymph vessel in your body. When you arrive, be mindful of any unusual activities you may be doing (kayaking, mountain climbing?!) and if you're outdoors use sunscreen and insect repellent. Have a great trip, and do let us know how it goes! Binney",

Katiejane, I can tell you a strange story about this, but it may be just me, because I've never heard anyone else mention it. Wearing bilateral compression 24/7 made me cry. Literally. Cried a lot, and there wasn't a reason I could think of. I wasn't sad, or depressed, I just cried. My DH also noticed I was \"blanking out.\" I'd sit and do nothing, think nothing for minutes at a time. Naturally I worried that it must be brain mets. And then I read an article in the NLN newsletter about little kids with LE. They had to have a few hours a day without wraps or garments because they're just learning about their environment and need the sensory stimulation or they develop learning problems. Bingo! I started studying sensory deprivation, and my symptoms eerily matched. So I immediately started leaving the garments off for a couple of hours every evening, and that fixed it. When I'm not wearing garments I can't do much or I start to swell. I can read or watch TV or sew something simple, but I can't write notes or work on the computer or knit. I do rub my hands and arms on different textures -- the couch fabric, my desktop, my clothes -- to get some stimulation. Sometimes one hand or the other will feel like it's starting to swell, and I'll slip a glove on just that hand, but for the most part this works fine for me. If I want to do something more vigorous, though, I have to put the garments back on. See? Told you it was weird! I think I must be an extreme case or something. I do know that texture has always been very important to me (I love all the fiber arts), so walking through a fabric store, say, and not being able to reach out and feel the fabrics as I walk by has been very hard. (So I also remove a glove when I go through such places. If you do that, though, be sure to put it someplace secure -- these gloves are very pricey accessories to drop and lose!) Sure hope that helps, KatieJane. If you try it I'd be interested to know how it works for you. Sending you \"stimulating\" thoughts! Binney",

Big hugs, sharing your tears. But hey, I gotta tell you that I gave up on the things. Couldn't get over the grief of wearing them, couldn't NOT think about lymphedema for a single minute with the thing on. (Also, frankly, couldn't breathe too well with it on either. Fine when I was sitting quietly, but try to exert myself and I couldn't draw a full breath without a lot of stupid effort.) Wore them for about a year. My daughter-in-law does tatting, and I asked her for (gorgeous! hand-made!) lacy edgings that I stitched very lightly to the neckline, which made it almost bearable. But in the end I did mad searches for other options. And fortunately, there are some. At the moment I'm using a WearEase compression mastectomy bra. Lovely fabric, machine washable (hang it to dry, though), nice prosthesis pockets (or skip the prostheses), relatively minimal front zipper, doesn't show under my clothes. I use Silique light prostheses, which are made of beanie-baby beads with a thin silicone outer shell to give it a good shape and keep the weight way down. Since there's little silicone, it's not too bad in the heat (I live in the AZ desert), and the bean-bag back makes it easy for me to adjust it to fit without pressing on sensitive areas. But there are other options as well. If your fitter isn't familiar with them, ask her to look into ordering samples for you to try. My fitter had never heard of either the bra or the prosthesis, but now she's absolutely sold on them and very happy with both companies. Anyhow, here's a page about truncal lymphedema. At the bottom are pictures with links to a whole bunch of other chest compression options worth trying. http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm April, big hugs from me to you.

She's the \"costochondritis-and-PTSD\" expert, and I'm the one who's forever spotting lymphedema behind every bush -- er, I mean behind every breast. Anyhow, when you next see your doc, and you're discussing costo as a possibility, do inquire about breast lymphedema as well. Pain as you've described, in the location you mention, is a frequent accompaniment to lymphedema in the breast or chest (called truncal lymphedema). It's usually especially noticable when you remove your bra in the evening, too, as the change in pressure in that area is most noticable then. Early lymphedema often has little or no noticible swelling, and swelling in our treated breasts is especially difficult to detect because we don't really know what it OUGHT to look like. Once swelling begins, though, many women notice it first as indentations in the breast when the bra is removed. Good news is, it's treatable and treatment reduces the discomfort, usually to zero. Hmmm. Your doctor's going to wonder who in the world you've been talking to. Be well! Binney ",

Like you, I'm really hoping you're not dealing with lymphedema, and we'll be looking forward to what your lymphedma therapist has to say today. With lymphedema garments the fit is critical. Off-the-shelf sleeves are approximations that fit a wide range of women with \"average\" arms.

All of us with breast cancer are at risk for lymphedema, no matter what treatment we elect, but making breast cancer treatment decisions based on fear of lymphedema is risky at best and sorta senseless anyway. Our current science doesn't allow us to predict with any accuracy at all just who will or won't develop lymphedema. Recent research indicates there's even a genetic pre-disposition involved, and no way to predict who might be so predisposed. More to the point: Lucy, there is no reason whatsoever that any woman here should fear to end up like the picture you've unfortunately posted. If we are aware of our risk and alert to the proper treatment, it need NEVER progress to that state. But even if it did, proper treatment would reduce it with gentle directional massage and compression -- nothing surgical or pharmaceutical involved. In fact, the \"after\" picture of that woman's arm post-treatment is available on other sites on-line, and you will be encouraged if you see it, because it looks perfectly normal. Being haunted by such pictures is not only distressing, it's completely unnecessary. As for the lymphedema therapist who was here a few months ago spouting her own personal fear of lymphedema, her diagnosis was DCIS and therefore has absolutely nothing to do with this particular discussion. She has indeed seen lots of very difficult lymphedema, since she treats people with primary lymphedema (caused by in-born defects of the lymph system) which frequently goes undiagnosed for decades and has progressed to truly serious stages. So that also has zero to do with our situation. All that just to say, lymphedema is no treat, but it's absolutely nowhere near as threatening to us as the breast cancer beast -- they're not even in the same class. Please let's sort out these subjects and not continue to discuss them as though they were on a par. An ALND does NOT equal lymphedema. And a SNB (or even just a prophylactic mastectomy) does not excuse anyone from having to take sensible precautions to prevent it. We can do this! We're strong, smart women!

Here's information about finding a well-trained therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Since all of us bc veterans are at some risk for lymphedema, any exercise you undertake should be started VERY gradually and worked up to VERY slowly. Pay close attention to your arm and chest, and at the first sign of strain, heaviness, aching, tingling, swelling or just \"feeling funny,\" stop at once and rest it. Elevate your arm (on the back of the couch or car seat, on a pillow at night), stay extremely well hydrated, take several deep abdominal breaths at intervals throughout the day. Raise your arm above your head and open and close your fist slowly several times. Then try the exercise again the next day, but lowering the stress a notch, and see how it goes. Progress slowly! Depending on how fit you were before bc, how your arm responds, and how gradually you build up to it, you may or may not eventually be able to do exercises like push-ups and chin-ups safely. Certainly NOT the place to start, for sure! If you want to be safe with this, do connect with a specially-trained therapist who can guide you through the gradual work-up. Do keep in touch and let us know how it goes for you. Be well! Binney",

I'll bet you DO feel tired, and resting in bed is a good way of giving your body the help it needs to fight on. Also drinking plenty of water, yes?  I guess I'm not sure if you're saying you're still on the antibiotic, or if you're done with it already. Did they change the antibiotic when you went in again? One way or the other, if your blood work is still indicating infection, then I trust you're still on an antibiotic. (If not I think I'd ask why.) You're doing exactly what you should -- resting, and staying aware of what your body's up to. Don't ignore anything, and don't hesitate to traipse back there if you have any concerns at all.

I even looked forward to the oblivion of anesthesia, which under other circumstances I would have found terrifying. That rest and finality of finally getting past the surgery is delicious after all the stress of waiting for it. Looking forward to it with you! A couple of further lymphedema thoughts which will hopefully be of some comfort to you. First, recent excellent research finds that exercise is absolutely essential to both preventing and controlling lymphedema. Lacking a pump (like the heart that pumps the circulatory system), our lymph system depends upon the movement of our muscles pressing against the lymph vessels to propel fluid and ensure good circulation. Water activities are especially encouraged, as the water adds gentle compression and the activity is so often full-body. The past prohibitions against activity and lifting weights as a lymphedema risk have given way to recommendations for more exercise, not less -- always with the caveat that working up to former activity levels be done slowly and consciously. And second, I read a study a couple of years ago (that I didn't file and can't now find), which found that women with lymphedema (who we might assume have had their lymph system seriously damaged) have the same survival and recurrence/mets rates as women without lymphedema. In other words, researchers who started with the premise that the damaged lymph system would create extra risk of further cancer found that idea not supported by the reality. I have no idea why not, but it was a comfort to me. The lymph system is still quite mysterious to the medical community and it often defies expectations, almost always is encouraging ways. We're wonderfully made! You must be simply exhausted. There is NOTHING like this waiting --  it feels like such an impossible trap. Keep your eye on Monday, makingway -- it'll be good! Binney",

If not, take it in to her and have her check the fit and show you how to get it on, take it off, and launder it. That's part of their job and definitely not self-explanatory, for goodness sake! I use the same method to get mine on that shrink does, so beginner or veteran (), we're all on the same wave length. Turn down the top of your sleeve about half its length (or more if that works better for you), use a rubber glove on the other hand and tug the bottom into place, then sort of unroll it up your arm, keeping it as straight as possible. The rubber glove will help you smooth it into place -- and it DOES have to be smooth. You don't mention a glove or gauntlet, so if she didn't order you one go back and tell her you want that too (another prescription, probably). That'll keep any swelling from getting trapped in your hand. Compression garments are not going to be your most comfortable accessories , but they shouldn't bind or leave long-lasting indentations at the wrist or the top of your arm.  Your hand and fingers should not turn strange shades of white, blue or purple, or be icy to the touch. If your elbow is irritated by the fabric, try dusting on a bit of cornstarch in the area before putting the sleeve on. Same thing for irritation that can happen in the webs of the fingers with gloves. Dump some cornstarch into the toe of a cotton sock, close the top with a sturdy rubber band, and pat it whever it's needed. Wear your new garments the first time for only an hour or so, and work up to longer periods of time until you can wear them for the length of your plane trip plus an hour or two after you get there (to give your lymph system time to adjust). Once you're sure they fit well and you're used to them, they'll be excellent for exercise, long car trips, and any strenuous or unusual activity as well. If you continue to have trouble getting into the thing, there's a donning aid called a Slippee or an Easy-Slide (or some such) that makes the whole process much easier. Some women swear by them, but if I had one I'd just lose it somewhere and get frustrated looking for it, so I go with the manual method. Less is more! Let us know how it goes! And happy trails!

      "Content": "Sep 4, 2008 04:20PM - edited Sep 4, 2008 04:24PM by Binney4 mb, if you're using them for prevention, then I'm surprised at the compression too. Hmmmm! I sure would go back to the doc in that case and ask for an explanation, because that isn't the usual preventive compression. He may have some reason based on your particular circumstance, and if so he should be able to explain that to you. Until you find that out, maybe hold off on wearing it at all. With LE, more is not always better. Wow, Ralu, those are interesting questions! Since you bought the sleeve and gauntlet both from the same manufacturer I'd guess you can be pretty sure they're made to be worn safely together. Mine overlap by several inches and are designed for the glove to be worn over the sleeve, not the other way around. These garments are not for night wear at all. They're designed to be worn when you're awake, because the kind of compression they offer helps move lymph fluid as you move your muscles, not when you're still. Also, they can shift and bind while you sleep, and have a tourniquet effect, which is not a good thing. When you don't yet have LE, the garments are good to use for air travel, any long trips even by car, exercise, or any strenuous or unusual activity. Or if you overdo it with stressing your arm and it starts to feel heavy or tingly. I do think air travel is a risk for truncal LE as well, though I've never heard it mentioned, except by some of us who have truncal LE already and can feel it trying to swell when we fly . So a good bet for that is a well-fitting bra with wide straps that don't cut into your shoulders and a wide bottom band for support. High under the underarms is good too, and of course no underwires. A tight-fitting leo or sport shirt under your clothes can help too, but turn it inside out so the seams don't press into your skin. As for the imprints on your skin from the texture of the garment, as long as they're not just in one place so it looks like it's tighter in one place than another, and as long as the imprints don't last long when you take them off, then I'd say that's just the nature of wearing such close-fitting clothes. For me, it took some getting used to; I've never liked my clothes tight, so it was a strange new feeling. Ralu, I'm really delighted that you're doing so well with all the challenges you have to getting good LE care. You rock!!! Hugs all around, Binney",

The one you had, Prettiest, sounds like Mondors Syndrome or Mondors Disease. It's a thrombosed, irritated vein that runs from the breast sometimes clear to the waist. Perhaps the aspirin was to break up the blood clots that block it, though even untreated it tends to disappear fairly quickly. The same thing can happen in our arms, with an irritated vein lining causing one thick cord that can show up only in places along the arm (often near the elbow) or run from the axilla to the base of the thumb. It's considered to be a kind of phlebitis. Either of those will usually last from one to six weeks and gradually disappear. But a smaller cord, or several cords, in the axilla and/or arm is different because these cords include lymph vessel tissue, so they're considered a problem of the lymph system, not the veins. They're the ones called Axillary Web Syndrome (AWS). They take longer to resolve, usually around three months, and they respond to gentle stretching. Stretching by walking your fingers up the wall while you're standing under a warm (not hot!) shower can be especially helpful. So can a physical therapist, who can do some gentle soft-tissue stretching and also show you stretching excercises to keep your arm supple. AWS is painful and limits your ability to stretch your arm out straight. As MB says, some therapists \"snap\" the cord, which gives instant relief, but there is some question about whether that's the best approach, since it is lymph tissue, and the lymph system is already compromised and thrives on being handled gently. So most therapists take a more conservative approach and stress gentle stretching until it works itself out. Either way it can come back, but again it's fixable, so hang in there! Bummer! Who needs yet another freaky thing! Kleenex, hope you're feeling better soon! Be well! Binney",

My worry about that approach, though, would be that intense heat is a serious lymphedema risk. Heat draws lymph fluid and can overwhelm our already-compromised lymph systems. And since axillary web syndrome is already a lymphedema risk factor, the addition of intense heat may not be a wise course. Stretches in a warm shower can help, though. We're all at risk for lymphedema following bc treatment, some more than others, and the risk is for life, so avoiding some of the more likely triggers may keep you from joining this \"swell\" sisterhood.

Might be a good idea to be clear with your surgeon too about your elevated infection risk (cellulitis), so that s/he can be on top of antibiotic use before and after surgery. I think you've done a fantastic job of getting yourself in shape and fit for this, and seeking out the information you need to manage it all with success. You rock! Binney",

You'd have to give it a test run before deciding, though: http://www.ebags.com/product/maxpedition/monsoon-gearslinger/103279 Washing your gloves without using the dryer will likely bring them back into shape anyway -- I never put mine in the dryer and they always spring right back with just washing. In fact, we need to keep in mind that wetting them makes them tighter, so if your gloves get wet while you're wearing them, be careful that the compression doesn't increase and cause your fingertips to swell or turn blue. If you live somewhere humid you may not want your gloves wet during the warmer months because of the danger of fungal growth. I live in a desert, so fritzing them with a spray bottle of water keeps me cool when I have to be out in it, and they dry within minutes. YamahaMama, that's not a stupid question at all! That's exactly the sort of question we're all left with, because I'd bet even our therapists have never thought it through. During the last big influenza scare we emailed all the garment makers and asked them for advice about hygiene with LE garments, and not one of them had any suggestions (except to wash them absolutely every day), though a couple told us nobody had ever asked them that before. Anyway, here's what everybody here came up with: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Lymphedema.htm#GLOVES_AND_HYGIENE My LE is bilateral, so I do have to remove my gloves to use the bathroom and to wash my hands. <sigh!> The business about irritated finger webs is a serious problem. My glove fabric has to be soft because I'm compression-sensitive, so it's been easier to get used to than if I were wearing something as tough as Elvarex. The good news is that your finger webs get used to it (at least to some degree) so they react less. In the meantime, though, I used cornstarch to ease the chafing. I dumped some into the toe of a clean cotton sock and rubber-banded the top of the sock closed, then I could pat it on just where I wanted it without getting it all over the floor. BUT, cornstarch, being a carbohydrate, might encourage fungal problems too, so somebody suggested another kind of powder with the same properties, but I forget what it was -- anybody? No doubt while I've been typing all this five other people have posted with good ideas, but I still hope some of this helps! Hugs, Binney",

I still use it from time to time for anxiety (I have bilateral LE in arms, hands, chest and back, and now one leg, and sometimes the constant compression makes me claustrophobic), but for sleep I go with the warm milk or lemon/ginger tea. On the tea or milk, though, it only works for me if I deliberately relax while sipping it. Kind of let myself ease off the day's stresses.

With LE the swelling from the infection is not necessarily going to go away when the infection does without some work, but it's important to be on top of it as soon as possible. Also, since your arm is still swollen, the therapist might check the fit of your garments before you wear them again. Really glad to hear you're continuing to heal.

A Therapy Intensive, where they do Manual Lymph Drainage massage and then wrap your arm for you, is usually done daily for a least a couple of weeks (or at least several times a week). If your husband can go with you to your next few appointments she can teach him and you both. Until you have a chance to learn it from the therapist, wearing your sleeve and glove or gauntlet is probably better than wrapping it with too much pressure in the wrong places. Elevate your arm as much as possible, stay really well hydrated, and do some deep abdominal breathing at intervals -- at least until you can see your therapist again and get a schedule in place for treatment and education.

If the burn (or other injury) is treated and dressed, then getting a garment on without disturbing the dressing is a challenge and may require a special donning aid to get it in place without scraping the wound -- and it might still irritate the burn as you move your arm. So it's better to elevate the arm and stay well hydrated, both of which will help discourage swelling. Some swelling is expected whenever there's an injury, as the lymph fluid rushes to the site to perform its clean-up chores. Elevation helps that extra fluid to get back into circulation, and drinking plenty of water helps by diluting the lymph fluid and helping it move. So glad you're doing well -- good for you for jumping on it quickly! Be well, Binney",

There are so many measurements involved in making gloves, and they're all so tiny and exacting. But a well-fitting glove is a thing of beauty! Well, okay, maybe not beauty. Comfort, though. And of course healing too. Jinky had a real battle with the back of her hand, so I hope she'll come along soon and recount her adventures with finding a solution. I had trouble with the space between thumb and first finger too, and my therapist told me to wrap that hand with gauze BACKWARDS. In other words, you know how you hold out your hand with the fingers spread and the palm facing the floor, and then you roll the gauze TOWARD your body when you start? Well, roll it AWAY from your body instead. When you get to your thumb you'll realize at once that it does something quite different to that area. It works really well for me, and I hope it'll help some of you \"hand\" lymphers too. As for the night-gear companies dealing directly with customers, I haven't had that problem with Solaris, only with JoviPak. I've called them several times over the past couple of years to ask if they could help with one thing or another, and they refuse to talk to me or answer my questions. They say, \"We only deal with fitters and therapists!\" They've actually been quite short and rude. Still, I thought it must be just bad luck in whoever answered the phone. But then at the recent NLN conference I visited their booth and got into a very exciting and stimulating conversation with one of their designers. We were really hitting it off and she even said to me, \"Ooh, I love your enthusiasm and excitement!\" Great stuff. Only then I mentioned I was a LE patient, not a professional, and she literally backed away from me. \"We don't deal with patients!\" she says, and sure enough, that was the absolute end of our conversation. One of the oddest things I've ever seen. Haven't got a clue what that's about, but it sure did put me in my place -- yessiree! I truly don't get it -- virtually every item they make is for LE patients, not for therapists or fitters, so how they hope to avoid us (or why they're willing to risk our ill will) I can't imagine. But I'm hoping they'll get a grip at some point and start treating us like the valued customers we are. As for Solaris, I think the swell-spot prices are on their site, and you might try emailing or calling for prices for other items. If they're custom, though, they won't be able to give you a price because \"the devil's in the details.\" If you want finger spacers, that's another cost, or a zipper, or a built-in dorsal compression spot, or whatever. So they have to see the order before they can decide the price. Also, as Kira indicates, the quoted price will depend on who's paying for it. Bizarre as that may be. But ALL our garments fall into that \"bizarre pricing\" category. Tomatojuice, if your insurance is paying for your sleeve and glove there's a real good chance they'll pay for the night sleeve and glove too. Get a prescription and see. I never heard of insurance paying for swell-spots, but it might be worth a try. At any rate, those aren't very expensive. Wishing you all great solutions for your hand swelling! Hugs all around!

Ask your onc for a speedy referral for an evaluation by a fully trained lymphedema (LE) therapist. S/he can teach you a gentle prophylactic massage to protect your arm and chest, give you tips for LE prevention, do baseline arm measurements for future reference, and fit you for a compression sleeve and glove (that you can wear under your leather gloves) to use for any exercise, travel, or strenuous activity -- like caring for your horses. Be sure any LE therapist you see is fully trained (at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her/his PT or OT certification and at least a year's experience treating LE). Here are a couple of sites for locating trained therapists near you: www.mylymphedema.com  Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links. www.clt-lana.org  Current thinking (and research) on LE prevention is that exercise is good, but strain and stress on the arm is not.  Use good body mechanics; stay very well hydrated; stop at once if your arm feels tired, achy, strained, or tingly. If that happens, rest it and try to keep it elevated as much as possible. More information on the National Lymphedema Network web site, especially their position papers on Risk Reduction and Exercise (and Air Travel too!) They're here: www.lymphnet.org Looking forward with you to real healing and an uneventful journey through treatment. Be well! Binney",

So we contacted a few sleeve companies and asked, and they said absolutely don't use them for sun protection. A while back, though, another lympher said her particular sleeve did, in fact, leave her skin white when the rest of her tanned. So apparently some work that way, others not. I like the idea of wearing something sun-proof over the sleeve (as long as it's not adding unneeded compression). Better safe than sorry on this one. SimpleLife, a visit to a well-qualified LE therapist to show you how to do Manual Lymph Drainage massage would be a huge help.

Stanton, a researcher in the UK, has published studies in the last couple of years that indicate some people have a more robust lymph system to start with, while others (like you and me, apparently!) have lymph systems that are already working at full capacity and get overwhelmed when the system is compromised. Other factors play a role too, like overweight and previous trauma to the area, but those factors alone don't explain why some of us get a pass on this and others don't. KellieD, hello! Bioimpedence spectroscopy is a technique that detects fluid in the tissues at any given time. It cannot diagnose lymphedema, but some places are using it to note any fluctuation in fluid retention that might signal the presence of excess lymph fluid. An increase over time might then suggest you should see a lymphedema therapist for a complete evaluation. Researchers who have compared it with other assessments for LE (perometry, tape measurements) have not found it to be effective by itself. It needs the clinical involvement of someone actually trained in LE. Even the company that makes and promotes the bioimpedence device does not claim it's diagnostic, but they do market it aggressively and not always very clearly. You might want to request a referral now to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for baseline arm measurements, personalized risk-reduction hints, instruction in lymph massage to use prophylactically, and fitting for compression garments for exercise and travel.

(What crazy timing!) So I'll just copy it here and save my fingers. Binney4 wrote: Hi, Sunkist and Chattie, I wanted to pass along this information, for your consideration. I hope TenderisourMight will come by and comment on it, and I'll be checking with my lymphedema contacts too over the next few weeks to gather as much information for you as possible, because we've all been watching this with real interest. Chattie, Dr. Allen is a plastic surgeon who pratices in SC and NY. He's a pioneer of the DIEP procedure, and he has a young doctor in his practice, Marie LoTempio, who has been practicing microsurgery with BLOOD vessels and went to Frace earlier this year to learn from the French surgeons who have pioneered this type of surgery (it's called \"anastamosis\") with LYMPH vessels and nodes. What you need to know is that this is a very recent development, has not been done widely or on very many women, and it has risks, both actual and theoretical, that have not really been  explored completely (because of the newness and the limited experience with it.) The \"success\" rate quoted by Dr. Allen's earlier notices about it does not refer to cures, but to \"improvement\" in the LE. In France, this surgery is reserved for women whose LE has not responded to CDT therapy, because of the still-experimental nature of the surgery, but the promotional material on Dr. Allen's site does not mention that restriction. In fact, it appears that they're promoting anastamosis as an option very early on, at the time of reconstruction. One of the BIG unanswered questions regarding this surgery is the possibility that in removing inguinal (groin) nodes to move them to the axilla, you are putting yourself at risk for LEG and ABDOMINAL lymphedema as well. I've communicated with Dr. LoTempio about this, and she says that it's not usual for this to happen because of the specific area where the nodes are removed. But realistically, you're still putting yourself at risk for the rest of your life for this possibility. One promising direction of serious study right now in the LE field is the possibility that the reason some of us get LE in our arms and some do not may depend on a genetic (or at least prior) lymph system problem -- a lymph system that in some way is less effective than normal. If that proves to be true, then your leg LE risk following a surgery like this is actually quite high. And nobody knows that yet. So, to put it briefly, I have real reservations about this, except possibly in the case of very advanced LE that is resistant to therapy. That said, the following is certainly all quite positive. Chattie, the wish to be free of LE is almost overwhelming -- for me too. But please proceed with real care and caution here, because it has the potential to screw your life up royal. Okay, here's Dr. Allen's web site: http://diepflap.com  Here's their current statement about their LE program, which I note tonight is waaaay more conservative than it was earlier this month, when some of us began questioning the statistics they had there. (Glad to see this!)   http://diepflap.com/lymphedema_treatment.html And here's Dr. LoTempio's bio from that web site:   http://diepflap.com/about-drlotempio.html#top You'll note she studied in Frace with Dr.Corinne Becker, whose published research regarding this surgery is here: http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&pubmedid=16495693 If you'd like, I'll keep you updated as I find out more about this. Let me know if you're interested.  Be well, Binney",

Please don't worry about being \"negative\"--goodness, we've all been there, and saying so here is entirely understandable. Rant on! As for breast surgeons and other doctors not giving LE sufficient thought, that's too true. Here at bc.org we've had several doctors who have themselves developed LE, and they're now strong advocates for better training in med schools and nursing programs, as well as questions that cover the lymph system on the certifying tests, to encourage prospective doctors to pay attention! As for reparative surgery, there are a couple of options, none of which work as a cure. Node transfers move nodes from other areas of the body to the armpit in the hope they'll find their new surroundings amenable and start to work clearing lymph fluid. Another procedure links the remaining lymph vessels directly into the circulatory system in an attempt to circumvent the damaged or missing nodes. A third, used primarily when the swelling has become dysfunctional and there is a lot of fat accumulation below the skin surface, is a form of liposuction, designed both to remove the fat and to leave as much of the delicate lymph system intact as possible. Node transfer was developed in France by Dr. Corinne Becker who has been resistant to taking the time to do any reliable studies. In the ones she's published she did some cherry-picking of subjects, so the results are hardly representative. There is a very thorough study presented by PTs in France who have had to deal with the results of these surgeries, and they're not encouraging. (Among other problems, \"borrowing\" lymph nodes from another site can result in LE in the donor site.) This procedure seems to result in a softer limb, though not necessarily a smaller one. It also appears to limit the number of cellulitis infections in people who are prone to them, though that is not true in every case. Still, Dr. Becker has been in the U.S. on a number of occasions training U.S. doctors, so if that's something you want to consider there's no advantage to traveling to France. In Sweden, Dr. Brorson is the expert who developed LE liposuction. He does not use it except in situations where the LE has been out of control long enough to result in serious fat-deposition issues. He too has taught U.S. doctors his procedure, but they are not all as dedicated as he is to discerning who might be appropriate for the procedure. He is clear that it is not a cure, and patients who undergo this procedure regain functional limb contours, but MUST wear compression consistently for life. The linking of lymph vessels into blood vessels is a procedure that has not been done over a long period of time. As a result there are no long-term studies of how this might affect the on-going efficacy or safety of the surgery. We just don't know. There are doctors here in the States doing their own studies on this and the node transfer surgeries, but obviously we won't have results on long-term effects until\u2026well, until a long time has passed! And then only if the doctor-researchers involved follow their patients over the long term. In other words--yep, still experimental. Here at bc.org we have a number of women who have had the surgeries, and they post their progress from time to time so you can follow their anecdotal accounts. There are also women who have had these surgeries with unfortunate outcomes, and they do NOT post here publicly (though some of us hear from them in private messages), so it's harder to follow that half of the equation. If you're interested in pursuing any of these options, take your time and do your homework. Your question about testing for genetic predisposition is a whole 'nother issue. What is currently known is that some of us are born with a more robust lymphatic system than others. So far, nobody knows why, much less which genes may be affected. There is well-funded research going on at a university in Georgia that is looking at this kind of question. They're trying to play catch-up on learning about exactly how the lymph system operates, which is itself a field that has been sadly neglected. There is imaging available (but not widely, and it takes expert interpretation to understand) that can tell a person something about their lymph system even, say, before bc surgery. But that still would not tell any one individual whether or not they will develop LE. And even if it did, they could do only so much to prevent or delay it. For that matter, risk reduction strategies are another area that has been too little researched. A recent study that seemed to debunk such strategies was poorly done and even more poorly interpreted. (In fact, it's created havoc for those of us who wish to protect ourselves.) The most obvious problem with designing a study to test whether certain things (like blood pressure cuffs, airplane trips, blood draws, heavy lifting, etc.) can trigger LE, is that it would be unethical to expose at-risk women to those things purposely. Finally, you mention not being able to lift more than five pounds for life. That's most likely untrue, though if you want to do more it takes some dedication to a very gradual weight-training regimen.

I hope you'll soon have the answers and relief you need and can take back control of your life! Has your surgeon brought up the idea of replacing the drains? That might be the next logical step. I can't tell from your post if the issue is the seroma itself or if you're dealing with a non-healing wound. A wound-vac might be helpful for resolving a wound that is slow to heal. A seroma is pooled fluid, which (as in your experience) can be drained. Lymphedema on the other hand is fluid that is dispersed throughout the cells, so it can't be drained, though it can be moved toward functioning lymph nodes by a gentle massage-like technique called Manual Lymphatic Drainage (MLD) that is managed by a well-trained lymphedema therapist.  Seromas \"act up\" with exercise, so might you have done something recently to set it off again--a new exercise program, heavy housework or gardening? You might want to lie low over the weekend in order to reduce further fluid build-up. Seromas are not rare, and for some of us they can drag on for way too long, but I'm betting there will be light soon at the end of this tunnel. Hang in there! Gentle hugs, Binney",

Best thing is that you're not feeling alone anymore! A few random thoughts you can add to your considerations: The lymph system has a short \"window\" of healing and regrowth after surgery--a couple of weeks. Beyond that it isn't likely to repair itself enough to reroute lymph fluid without additional help. The fluid in a seroma, on the other hand, may eventually be re-absorbed by your body, or the \"pocket\" it fills may need surgical help adhering as GemStateGirl described above.  Every time an incision is made, it results in scar tissue formation, which can further block lymph flow, rather than promoting it, so you're right to feel that further incisions for the purpose of draining the pooled fluid may not be something you want. Since some posters elsewhere have suggested that what you're dealing with is truncal lymphedema, here's information about that: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunck... While you may well also be dealing with truncal lymphedema as well, a seroma is NOT lymphedema. Seromas pool fluid and can be drained; in lymphedema the fluid is dispersed throughout the tissue and cannot be drained (though it can be moved out of the area temporarily with proper, non-invasive lymphedema therapy).  Again, I just want to encourage you that one way or another you can and will get this under control.

But she is not spouting this stuff on BC.ORG, so I can also understand their unwillingness to take out after something they have no control over. I'll be really grateful if BC.ORG updates their own LE information pages and corrects the implications they make (like those CS points out). I don't see how they can do that well without consulting with real experts in lymphology, so I sincerely hope they do that. As too many of us have seen, even a whole team of our cancer doctors can go wrong on LE information, because it's really not on their radar.

As patients, we are powerful here -- several people have mentioned the marketing aspect of the JH \"expert\" boards, and we're the targeted consumers. So it's possible that if JH begins to believe the message being sent is negative, the marketing motive may be enough to bring it to an end.

When the fluid is sort of \"puddled\" so it can be drained, that's called a seroma. But if the fluid is all in among the cells, not in a \"puddle\" but dispersed all over in the tissue (so you can't aspirate it), that's lymphedema. Lots of our doctors don't even know that breast (or chest) lymphedema exists  much less that a well-trained lymphedema therapist can get the fluid out of there and help you learn how to keep it out.

A study last year in Scandinavia found that about 1/4 of such women develop breast LE. In this country, though, our doctors are often unaware of it and frequently don't diagnose it, or don't know what to do about it if they do. Sue, you don't say if you've been referred to a well-qualified LE therapist, but if not it's important to treat it, and sooner is better. The thickening (fibrosis) can be reduced and the lymph fluid moved out of the breast to reduce not only swelling, but any pain that accompanies it. Even more important from the medical standpoint, it can stop the progression of the LE and reduce your risk of infection (which is very high when lymph fluid is stagnant.) There's more information at the National Lymphedema Network website at: www.lymphnet.org For links to lists of well-trained LE therapists in your area, click on the Therapist Locator at: www.mylymphedema.com Hope this helps!

If not, why not ask your doc to refer you to one for a lymphedema consult and evaluation? Since you're already showing a tendency to swell with exertion, s/he could do baseline measurements to help you judge your progress, fit you for a sleeve and glove to wear for any strenuous activities and also teach you the proper lymphedema massage. Which, by the way, is being found to be helpful in preventing lymphedema. It's also relaxing and nice , so win-win!

A new technology for following edema measurement is called the Delfin Moisture Meter, and is being tested in Finland. Nitocris knows more about it and hopefully will be along with more information. http://www.delfintech.com/en/lymphedema/ In answer to your question, many researchers are using the L-Dex in conjunction with other measurements to assess how patients are doing in their studies, but the L-Dex alone can't present an accurate picture. Some researchers have abandoned use of it altogether as not being accurate enough. It's also expensive per test. Impedimed has funded a lot of researchers, who (as you can imagine) often have a hard time getting funding for LE research, and we do need to take into account how all that money might influence the field. Musical, if your skin reacted to the diodes, for goodness sake don't let anyone do it again, as skin reactions are the last thing you need on an area with LE or at risk for it--skin integrity is what keeps infection away. Good to know so you can avoid it in the future! Perometry (which Purple described) is quite accurate, but only measures arms so is useless for truncal. The perometry machine is wildly expensive, so relatively few centers have one. Water displacement is rarely used--it's messy, but accurate when done well. So tape measures remain the fall-back \"technology,\" and some experience is necessary to do it well. Doing it on your own arm is tricky (to say the least!), so best to have someone else do it. BoatinGirl, who does the post-surgical measurements? There's still no diagnosis, so obviously it's not done by the people you've contacted. If it's something the surgeon arranges I wonder if you can't dun him/her about doing it pre-surg also. If you point it out to him/her, the advantage of pre-surg measurements should be obvious, even to a surgeon! SpecialK, very true that there's no way to avoid LE altogether, even with all the risk reduction strategies we know of. Good idea to point that out as part of this discussion, because one of the nastier aspects of LE is the \"surprise\" element so many of us have experienced, of not being told about our risk and being set up for a serious blow. The real advantage of pre-measurement, risk-reduction and pre-knowledge is being able to monitor for developing problems. It also needs to be mentioned that post-treatment measurements are not enough: our doctors/nurses need to be asking us at every follow-up appointment about symptoms of heaviness, aching, tingling, pain, tight rings or bracelets, or bras that leave marks when we take them off. The earlier we treat these symptoms the easier it is to manage and control the LE moving forward. Whew! Kinda long-winded! Be well, all! BoatinGirl, looking forward to some resolution on this nonsense for you! Edited to add Woo-hoo indeed! Way to go, BoatinGirl! And may you never have a \"swell\" day ever! Binney",

Here's a page on medical emergencies with lymphedema that might help: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm A lot of us with lymphedema keep oral antibiotics on hand, with our doctors' blessing, so that any sign of infection can be treated at once. (NOT any cut, just any sign of infection. You treat the cut, then keep an eye on it, and you use the antibiotics only if you see the start of an infection.) The caveat on that is to call the prescribing doctor as soon as possible if you ever have to start them. Don't think I've ever heard anything about not using peroxide before so I don't know what that's about, but personally I always keep antiseptic wipes and bandaids with me so I can deal promptly with any skin breaks, whether bug bites or hang nails or paper cuts or something more drastic. It's pretty common with lymphedema for there not to be any obvious reason for the infection. One cause that's sometimes theorized is microscopic skin breaks from dryness, so daily use of a good moisturizer is one of the points of the skin care that's part of Complete Decongestive Therapy. I don't know if you've done a therapy intensive with a well-qualified lymphedema therapist, but if not, that has been shown to reduce the incidence of cellulitis (and that reduction is one of the main reasons for doing it!) Even if you have, you might want to see your therapist again to update your self-care skills and get her/his take on your situation. If you do have repeat cellulitis episodes it can help to see an Infectious Disease specialist, but make sure the one you see has experience with lymphedema-related infections so he/she is on top of the elevated risk we have. Gosh! Stay well! Tell us how we can help. Binney",

Educating them pre-surgery is a good idea, but maybe take it a step further and provide them with the information in writing. Jobst had (and may still have--haven't checked) a booklet called \"Lymphedema--management today\" that is meant for professionals and is graphic enough to get their attention. They're free for the asking. StepUp-SpeakOut has a page written by a doctor for medical folks that you can print and pass out to everyone too. It's here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/essential%20informa... You can highlight any areas in that document that you want to emphasize. I have multiple copies of both with me and hand them out liberally, telling them something like, \"Wow, here's the latest on LE management, the field is changing so rapidly I know it's hard to keep up!\"  Ask your surgeon if you can wrap your arm for surgery--definitely a plus during recovery as well. Some will allow it, as the arm is draped anyway. I've wrapped mine in the past, after writing on the arm first with permanent marker (comes off later with alcohol), because we have a gal here who woke up to find her bandages off, stuffed into a bag under the bed, and a bp cuff pumping away on her arm. I also wear a G-sleeve over my wrapped arm, but you can wear one on your arm without wrapping too. I get mine from the G-sleeve site, but on another thread recently someone mentioned you can get them from the American Cancer Society catalog now too (I think� the catalog is called TLC). The neon-pink alert bracelets are free from the ReidSleeve people here: http://www.lymphedema.com/alertband.htm If you're going to wrap your arm, ask for two bands, because one doesn't fit around a wrapped wrist (I tape them together). One gal awhile ago wrote prohibitions on her arm and then had her surgeon sign her arm before surgery, and pointed the signature out to everyone who came within range. That seems like a good plan to me, though it's no guarantee either. Once you're out cold, you really have no say in the matter. In talking pre-surg with the anesthesiologist (who's the most likely to violate my arm), I always try to throw in the thought that since the circulation in my arm is compromised it's a bad place to put anything like drugs or hydration, since he then won't be able to predict how efficiently it will be distributed to the rest of my body. That usually gives them pause. Essentially, our LE is most in danger when in hospitals, doctor offices and other medical settings. That's a pathetic set of circumstances, but knowing it's true does help us prepare to educate and strategize. Still, why on earth is this our job?! Hugs all around, Binney",

The only reason I know about the steep placement angle for the robotic hysterectomy is because a good friend had that done and was not happy with the recovery issues, and after the fact she did a LOT of research about it. She has LE in her hand, mostly, but the amount of upper-body swelling was frightening, and recovering was much harder than she's anticipated. None of this is minor, and when we're faced with it we really need to make room in our lives to deal with it. So I think information beforehand is key to how the recovery period will go. It's also important to understand we can make decisions about what kind of treatment we have. Too often the available options aren't spelled out for us. Like you, I wish we had evidence-based conclusions on these issues. Beesie might know where to find studies relating to this--she's a research guru. You might try PMing her. Hugs, Binney",

Her article emphasizes maintainence of ideal weight and talks about how a diet high in protein and low in fat, salt and sugar can help. She also recommends reducing red meat and chicken and is in favor of fish, especially salmon, mackerel, anchovies and tuna. Then she says that \"most importantly, a LE diet should be rich in vegetables and fruits, due to the...flavonoids and pyrones in these foods.\" She emphasizes the cruciferous veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, greens) and berries and pineapple, then says this: \"Not all vegetables are anti-inflammatory, however. Potatoes, eggplant, and tomatoes contain a chemical called solinine, which can trigger inflammation in some individuals.\" Which in my view is certainly not a \"Don't eat tomatoes!\" mandate. As far as I can tell, it's just another item to consider and may not apply to any given person at all. And on the other hand, if I were to find that every time I ate a tomato I had a flare, it might be a good thing to know about. Anyhow, for those who don't get Lymphlink (the quarterly newletter of the National Lymphedema Network), here's the wrap-up to the article: \"Recommendations for a healthy diet that will help manage LE include low calories, plenty of fluids, and low sodium. In addition, anyone with LE should strive for a diet that is high in fruits and vegetables and whole grains and low in transfats and high fructose corn syrup.\" Hmmmm.

I think, though, that if you're traveling or doing something strenuous or unusual, it's really wise to have a glove. Once you have swelling in your fingers it's awfully hard to keep it in control. Fingers are the pits! NJ, how on earth could your therapist NOT have done your fingers along with the rest of your arm?!! Any chance you can go back and tell her you want to know the whole deal?

I hope if anyone tries them they'll give us a full report -- please! At any rate Juzo, Gottfried, Barton-Carey, and Bio-Concepts all offer sleeves/gloves in assorted colors, and of course Lymphedivas has both solids and patterns.

As for your questions, lymphedema does not involve swollen lymph nodes, but there are all sorts of benign reasons why you might be experiencing that. So, no need to panic (though how you'd keep from panicking I can't imagine -- we're all hyper-worried about these things!) Cording is also NOT lymphedema. It's thrombosed lymph vessels, and it's possible that it's a factor in lymphedema developing later, though certainly not always. It's a separate condition, and with time it does resolve. So, good idea to see your doctor today and get his reassurance about all this. Please do keep us posted. Be well! Binney",

There's currently a popular form of \"lymph massage\" that is supposed to \"detoxify\" the body. It's available as an option to anyone at spas and resorts, and it's a pretty big business.  But it has nothing to do with medical, therapeutic lymphatic massage as practiced by therapists who have taken special training from accredited schools. Perhaps that popular form is the sort of \"lymphedema massage\" you ran into in Argentina, because the medical massage that's used to treat lymphedema wouldn't hurt anybody, in any language! The strokes are as gentle as petting a kitten, and you'd be more likely to fall asleep from sheer relaxation than to feel pain. I'm not sure from your post whether you mean the massage caused swelling, or whether you're talking about potential damage from the massage that might lead to lymphedema in the future. If you mean there's actual swelling, then you need a referral as soon as possible to a for-real lymphedema therapist. That's someone with at least 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training (from an accredited school) beyond their PT or OT certification, and at least a year's supervised experience treating lymphedema. Call and ask before you go. Here's a web site where you can follow the links from the Therapist Locator to find such a therapist near you: www.mylymphedema.com. But if you mean you're concerned about damage that might have been caused by the massage but isn't obvious yet, then you'll want to know about the risk reduction practices that can help you prevent lymphedema. You'll find them among the Position Papers at the National Lymphedema Network site: www.lymphnet.org. You might also want a visit with a well-trained lymphedema therapist, who can give you prevention tips, do baseline measurements to help with future evaluations, and fit you for a compression sleeve and glove to wear when traveling, exercising, or doing any heavy housework or unusual activities. Probably your question was a whole lot simpler than that. Sorry if I misunderstood! Hoping you never have any \"swell\" experiences! Binney ",

(There's a link in my post above for researching well-trained therapists near you.) As you're already discovering, none of the specialties claim lymphedema as part of their responsibility, and PCPs are usually just baffled by it (they tend to think the surgeons should be the ones dealing with it).

The StepUp-SpeakOut section on flat-knit and circular-knit explains the difference in the way they're made: Most off-the-shelf garments are \"circular knit,\" which means they're knitted continuously in a circular pattern that results in a roughly cylindrical shape with no seams. Custom made garments, on the other hand, are most often \"flat knit,\" or cut to the proper size from a flat piece of knitted fabric and seamed into shape. Circular knit garments are generally lighter in weight, and many people prefer the seamless look. Flat knit garments can be cut from a wide range of breathable fabrics and may include such features as zippers or extension panels to ease joint flexibility. And this about fabrics: The fabric used in your garment may be soft (like Juzo's \"Varian Soft\") or sturdy (like Jobst's \"Elvarex\"), or somewhere in between. It may feel flexible or stiff, smooth or rough. All these factors add to your sense of the fit of your garment, and to its effectiveness for you as well. An experienced fitter takes fabric choice into consideration in order to provide you with the garment best suited to your specific needs. A compression sensitive person may need a softer fabric to prevent her fingertips from turning an unhealthy shade of purple, while a person who tends to develop fibrosis easily may do better with a firm and sturdy fabric \u2013even if they both require the same compression level. What we feel as \"comfortable\" has to do with all those factors, and with the way they meet our individual needs, so no one version will do for all of us. That's part of why it's so hard to find just the right garments. Of course the other reason it's so hard is because we also need a smart and experienced and empathetic fitter to wade through all the possibilities and come up with the right combo. And, for what it's worth, it's one of the main reasons we started StepUp-SpeakOut -- so we all could do some \"comparison shopping\" and know what's out there besides whatever the local fitter stocks. There are a WHOLE lot more choices now than there were even six or eight years ago. Now all we have to do is wade through all this and get what works best for us! Onward! Binney",

The result of these experiments is a chaotic overgrowth of lymph vessels and the proliferation of (benign) tumors (the animals involved were not cancer survivors). There is no way to control or regulate the growth of either vessels or tumors. Consider: in order for cancer tumors to grow, they must create not only blood vessels but lymph vessels. In fact, the depth of penetration of lymph vessel growth into a tumor has been proposed as a measure of the likelihood that the tumor will metastasize. In other words, introduction of lymphatic growth factor into an area that may contain stray cancer cells may produce ideal conditions for tumor growth. Because of this risk--and the general state of lymphatic science that is unable to control or regulate the effects of the growth factor, much less predict its immediate or long-term effects--human experimentation with this growth factor is banned in the U.S. until much more is known about it. For that reason, the study mentioned here is being done in Finland, where the regulation of such things is much less stringent. And besides, that's where the company producing Lymfactin is headquartered. AND where medical care--and education about LE care--is in the hands of the government, which would potentially benefit from promoting Lymfactin. Too many conflicts of interest here, and way too many unanswered questions. At any rate, the growth factor study is currently in Phase I, which is not a test of the growth factor itself, but of the chemical (the \"medium\") they're proposing to deliver the growth factor once they determine if the medium itself is safe. There are top researchers in the U.S. who argue that the medium is one that causes an allergic reaction in a large percentage of patients, so Phase I will determine if even that much is feasible. So we wait. For lymphatic science to catch up with our need for accurate information, and for those who stand to profit from our condition to get their priorities in order. Be well, Binney ",

I clear my neck nodes and chest at odd moments throughout the day, because researchers have found that if you do only part of the massage, that's the part that's most effective. (Of course it's not nearly as effective as the whole massage, but some days...get real!) Even if I haven't had to wrap in a while, I practise wrapping on the first day of every month, just so I won't forget everything. Also on the first of each month I check my antibiotic bottle that I keep on hand, to be sure it hasn't expired.  I finally made a three-ring notebook with dividers, to store everything LE: garment dates and prices, massage and wrapping instructions, insurance stuff, articles and research news, garment and bandage laundering info, etc. I even sewed a pretty notebook cover for it--makes me feel ever-so-slightly happier about it all! I write the date I purchase bandages or garments with a laundry marker, on the hard little end of the bandage or the tag of the garment, so I know how old it is at a glance. (Very lousy memory!) In summer I store my night garments in the refrig during the day, so the foam will hold the cool at night. I email everybody when I have a question -- researchers, therapists, authors, garment makers, bandage suppliers, journal editors. I figure what we don't know CAN hurt us, and apparently it's entirely up to us to find out what we need to know about LE. I've gotten amazingly kind and helpful responses. I order colored sleeves and gloves. Just because it makes me feel better. I contacted www.shopwellwithyou.org and laid out my style needs and the problems I was facing having to wear garments, and they gave me a free fashion consult complete with shopping and ordering info. Free service provided by the daughter of a bc veteran. Try it! My daughter exercises with me every day. We use the Lebed DVD (www.lebedmethod.com), which is in segments, so we can do it throughout the day if we can't make a whole 45 minutes for it at one stretch. It's fun and very effective, and my daughter helps motivate me. I kept a diary for a couple of weeks of every stinking thing I did for my LE, writing down exactly how long each thing took. I was amazed at how LITTLE time it took, since I was convinced it had taken over my life! Then it's been easier to arrange times in the day when it's convenient to do each item, too, since I know exactly how long to allow. Since I have gloves on both hands, I have trouble getting a grip on doorknobs. My husband wrapped thick rubberbands around them for a non-slip surface. Because I live in the desert, where thing dry fast, I can wash my hands with my gloves on once or twice during the day and they dry within 15-20 minutes and look (and smell!) nicer. Also, in summer I can soak my sleeves down in cold water when I want to be outdoors. I take a spray bottle with me for longer periods and just make sure they dry thoroughly between wettings (don't need a fungus infection!) Enough! Anxious to hear about other coping strategies, Binney ",

Here are a few for starters: Compression garments are NOT good protection from sunburn, and there's nothing wickeder than a nasty burn on your LE arm. They also don't protect from insect bites, so use other protection. Those neckbands you soak and they stay cool for a long time can help keep you comfortable in hot weather. Plan your summer days so outside activities are done in the early morning or in the evening. Some night compression garments (mine are Solaris) can be refrigerated during the day, and the chipped foam filling holds the cool for a long time. When you remove your compression garments to swim, be sure to put them on again as soon as you're dry. Keep your skin well moisturized. And keep yourself well hydrated. If you live in a dry, hot climate you can wet down your sleeves sometimes to keep you cool, but be sure to let them dry thoroughly before wetting again -- you don't want to encourage a fungus infection. When traveling keep all LE garments and supplies (including your antibiotic ointment, antiseptic wipes and bandaids) with you in your carry-on. If you don't already have one on hand, ask your doctor about a prescription for an oral antibiotic to take with you when traveling, so you can respond quickly to infection.  In hot weather you need salt, so it's a bit more of a juggling act to keep from overdoing it and making swelling worse. And bearing in mind Darleen's harrowing experience last August, check your night sleeve for wasps before you put it on! Yikes! Enjoy! Binney ",

LE is a really tough diagnosis, and coming as it does after a battle with the bc beast, it can really take our feet out from under us. Most of us have found ourselves floundering with this for a while -- grieving is hard work, and it takes time. Do be gentle with yourself! It doesn't help that our medical teams often know little about it and tend to dismiss it. It's no small thing, so give yourself room! Arming ourselves with knowledge can help, if it's not too overwhelming. Burt and White's book, \"Lymphedema: a Breast Cancer patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing\" was a real boost for me when I was first diagnosed, with its stories of other women who struggled with LE and had the same feelings about it that I did. Also, Sherry Lebed's exercise DVD (www.lebedmethod.com) not only helps with the LE but lifts the spirits also. For straight information that can help when dealing with healthcare providers, the National Lymphedema Network is especially useful: www.lymphnet.org. On the other hand, Munchy, as msmarymac says, it REALLY DOES get easier. Once you have the self-care skills of MLD massage, wrapping, exercise, and skin care, you can start to take control of your life again. Steep learning curve, but there's pride and hope in knowing you can manage this and deal with it on your own terms. You'll get there, and it'll be good! Tell us how we can help, Munchy, Binney",

Here's why: there are two ways to add compression. One is (obviously) by a tighter fit. (For instance, if you're wrapping you might give a slight tug along the sides of your arm as you go up.) But the other way to add compression is not to make anything tighter at all, but to add layers. (For instance, if you're compression sensitive and can't handle that \"tug\" on the bandages, you can just add another layer of bandages without making it any tighter. As an example, when my upper arm is flaring I'll wrap without tugging at all, but wrap more closely at the top of my arm so there are more layers of bandaging there.) So what I'm seeing in the pictures is not a tight fit, but a bunched fit, which adds layers at the wrist and therefore compression. And you definitely don't want extra compression there. Hope that made sense! Be well, Binney",

I favor the second view, because I've found that if I hang out near the pool's water inlet and let the water flow massage in the proper direction and order it has a tremendous effect on my sluggish lymph system. I always wonder what kind of results we'd get if our therapists did MLD with our bodies submerged, using a gentle hose instead of their hands. Can't get anybody interested in trying it though! Enjoy!

That's very hard for me, because I'm basically a private person. Don't mind talking to nurses or even legislators, but the publicity stuff makes me feel like curling up in a corner. I suspect I may not be the only one. So those of you with a lot of pluck and some publicity savvy, can you please advise us, step by step, how to go about this and what to expect? Other ideas are welcome too. Let's brainstorm here and come up with a range of strategies to pick from. What I've tried is to offer to set up a LE information booth at October Komen events (turned me down flat: \"It's about breast cancer, not LE.\") But I do know some local Komen affiliates are more open to the subject, so it's worth a try. Here's a partial list of free resources you can request to stock your booth: Juzo has a patient information booklet called \"What You Should Know About Lymphedema\": http://www.juzousa.com/contact.asp The ReidSleevePeople offer free arm and leg LE hospital alert bracelets that make an excellent and very practical give-away: http://www.lymphedema.com/alertband.htm The LymphNotes website has a sheet about diagnosis and risk reduction, and LE alert wallet cards: http://www.lymphnotes.com Lots of product manufacturers will also send you brochures about their products, so if you have a favorite, do request material to share. If you can afford to put together a gift basket for a drawing, one with a Lebed exercise DVD, a bottle of bubble soap and a small beach ball is great for anybody, with or without LE. (Note for those who haven't done Lebed yet: blowing bubbles and using a ball are part of the exercise routine). Onward! Binney",

On the other hand, LE is a sneaky little dickens, so keep an eye on things and if you start to find swelling in the morning, it's time to wrap or use a night garment at night. Also, if you're traveling, if you overdid it with your arm during the day, or if you're super busy and haven't got time to pay attention to your arm, then using night garments or wrapping at night will help head of new problems until things calm down again. When I first went through LE treatment I couldn't sort out for myself what worked and what didn't . It takes time, and we can only \"experiment\" when things are in good control to start with. But with time and care you can find what you can get away with and what you can't. Be well! Binney",

Whether that's because she's too modest to take credit for this invention or too embarrassed to be associated with it, I leave to you to figure out. Here's her idea for elevating her arm when there's undue swelling: \"I stuck a hook in the ceiling over my bed.  Hung a dog leash from it and have just grabbed the leash handle with my hand for the last hour or so occasionally taking a bit of a break.  My arm feels SO much better as in no puffy feeling in the axilla area and the Oprah Winfrey wing area.  It this too weird a thing to do or what?  I'm too embarrassed to tell anyone else what I've been doing.  I'm even afraid to Google it.  I suspect my husband thinks it's some kind of kinky sex thing......OMG!  (No, I did share this with him.) \" Hmmm. Weighs pretty heavily on the \"too embarrassed\" side, doesn't it? Ah, well! She's also found it useful for when she's doing self-massage. It is a bit of a problem to figure out how to relax your arm and also reach it with your other hand when you're massaging it yourself, so this sounds like a workable idea. Well, except for the poor dog... Have a relaxing weekend, everyone! Binney ",

Has she tried different materials for the layer of wrapping that's next to your skin? Skin breaks are dangerous for an area with LE, so keep asking her about alternatives to the fabrics that are making you itch. Compression sensitive means something different. Basically, if I wrap too tightly or wear compression garments that are too tight or stiff it makes me swell more. My swelling responds well to light compression, but it gets worse with either higher compression levels or sturdier fabrics. I can wear Juzo soft or Gottfried garments, but the others don't work for me. It's not that they irritate my skin or make me itch, it's that they make the swelling worse.  Hope that helps!

I doubt it's a problem of not trying hard enough, but it sure is something that takes time and a lot of effort to learn. On the other hand, once learned it gives you a tremendous sense of freedom to live your own life again. Actually kinda makes you proud! So it's well worth the trial to learn it. I hear you on having to do it with your non-dominant hand, and that does make it even more of a challenge. But it CAN be done.

I now use only WearEase Slimmer camis--a size small in beige and a medium in black because the darker colors always seem to be snugger in compression garments. I hope you find a really good solution.

As for on-line suppliers, I've used North American and BandagesPlus, and next time I think I'll try LymphedemaProducts, which is connected with the Norton School (therapist training), because it seems to have some really good prices, especially during their frequent sales. Both BandagesPlus and the Norton one have people you can call up and talk to for advice about their products. Don't know if North American does or not. Let us know how it goes, who you order from and how the customer service is so we can all be smarter consumers.

How about a referral from any one of your doctors to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for evaluation? If it's breast lymphedema (which is fairly common following lumpectomy and rads) then surgery sure isn't going to fix it and could make it worse. But a good therapist can reduce the swelling and help you keep it that way. Here's a page about breast lympedema (it's actually called \"truncal\" lymphedma): http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm And here's one about how to find a well-qualified lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Because stagnant lymph fluid is a very high infection risk, do watch for redness, heat to the touch, new swelling or pain, and get help at once.

A poorly-fitting sleeve can make LE worse, that's for sure. And wearing a sleeve without hand protection can cause fluid to accumulate in the hand -- not good! The study your onc heard reported absolutely did not show that weight-lifting \"slashed\" anything, as all the press releases are claiming. The issue is that women used to be told (when they were told anything at all about it) not to lift anything with their affected arm. This new study shows that well-supervised weightlifting won't necessarily bring on LE and that the strengthening may actually help reduce the risk. Those results, though, are limited to a specific protocol developed for the study, so some knowledgeable supervision and paying attention to your own body are both important for anyone planning to begin weight-lifting post surgery. It is another way to reduce risk, but not the only one, and it would be SOOOO helpful if our surgeons and oncs would consistently give us all the information we need to make our own decisions about these things. What's important to understand is that neither the study researchers nor anyone else in the lymphedema world has ever claimed that weight-training is a treatment for LE. It can supplement proper therapy and self-care, but LE is not a do-it-yourself project because it's so complicated and so easy to do damage (which is why all these doctors claim the whole thing is a controversy). There's no controversy over treatment: it's Complete Decongestive Therapy performed by a well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist, and it includes Manual Lymph Drainage massage, layered wrapping in special short-stretch bandages (except in very early stage LE), continuing compression as required, excellent skin care, and special exercises. It also includes us learning how to do these things competently ourselves, so we can take back control of our lives. A position paper about LE Treatment is available at the National Lymphedema Network website: www.lymphnet.org. There are other position papers there too. Maybe copy them off and give them to your doctors if you think they'd be open to learning more. DO keep us posted on your progress -- and BRAVA to you for catching it early! What's sad is that many of our doctors, who are very competent in their own specialties, don't know much about the lymph system or treating LE. We can and should continue to rely on them for the information we need in other areas, but LE advise is best when it comes from the medical professionals who have studied it. MHP, there are recommendations and good suggestions for using compression garments for flights at the NLN site also in a position paper on Air Travel. Why she'd say there aren't any is beyond me! (Unfortunately, though, it's not unusual....) We can't settle all the controversies because the science of lymphology just isn't up to speed yet. But we do have the freedom to learn all we can and make our own compromises with both the risk of LE and conditions of living with it. When everybody \"out there\" makes us feel frantic with their non-answers, we can still take our courage in hand and move forward with grace! Don't let 'em get to ya'! Hugs, Binney",

Too tight compression can also result in rebound swelling when you remove the garment, so keep an eye on things and maybe cut back again on the compression. Stay well hydrated, take it easy with the hand, and definitely elevate (with support) as much as possible. Good for you for making the effort to land on the non-LE side.

There are women out there with lymphedema following simple breast augmentation or reduction as well, with no cancer involved at all. The risk is greater when nodes are removed, but any surgery in the chest area damages lymph vessels and creates scar tissue that can block lymph flow. There's some new research evidence that suggests that those of us who develop lymphedema do so because our lymph systems throughout our bodies are not as fully functional as the lymph systemas of those who don't. In other words, it may be that we're simply more susceptible to lymphedema anywhere in our bodies, so further surgery of any sort raises our risk. That said, though, there are steps you can take to reduce your lymphedema risk. Here are two pages with information on that: http://www.lymphnet.org  (See their Position Papers on risk reduction, plane travel, and exercise) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Sure wish this were truly cut-and-dried, but it's more like a game of chance. Percentages of risk mean very little, since we're all different and there's no way for you to know what YOUR personal risk might be. Stay in touch! Binney (Yuck! I just re-read this and I sound like the bad-news bear. So I'll add that since you're on top of it, catching any new lymphedema early would certainly make it easier to handle and more quickly responsive to treatment.)",

The idea that it's part of a body rhythm never occured to me, but it sure is a fascinating thought. I have kids with Type I diabetes, so years ago when it came out there was a \"Dawn Phenomenon,\" where the blood sugars altered suddenly at dawn, I had a fit when we were planning a winter visit to Alaska because the sun doesn't appear until nearly noon, and I had no idea what that would mean to their blood sugars. Chaos, probably! Sure would be interesting if there were some studies done about this -- though I'm not sure it would have any practical application. The diabetes Dawn Phenomenon helps us plan the baseline insulin pump doses, but what would we change if we knew our LE swelling was cyclical like that? Not sure. Maybe it would be significant, though, to the researchers who are trying to understand the working of this nearly-invisible lymph system. Katiejane, I've been meaning to add that because of the importance of sensory stimulation to me I go barefoot as much as I can. When it's cold (or too hot!)

The other possibility is cellulitis, which can sometimes \"brew\" for a while before it breaks out into a full-fledged raging stupid infection. So do keep a close eye on this and get help at once if you have any indication of infection. Here's information about it so you know what to look for: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Medical_Care_lymphedema.htm You mention wearing a sleeve but not a glove or gauntlet (fingerless glove), so I also wanted to share this short article about the importance of hand protection when wearing a sleeve: http://lymphedivas.com/lymphedema/gauntletandsleeve/ Be well, and do let us know what you discover, Binney",

Unfortunately it's important to clear the nodes before doing MLD, and then to work the fluid toward the nodes, starting at the nearest point and moving down gradually to the hand. That way the nodes are ready to receive the fluid you're moving toward them, and each part of the arm is cleared before you move more fluid through it. That said, I do find it helps to gently do whatever part is flaring throughout the day--just feels better. If you have the Lebed DVD you might put that into your computer from time to time during the day and do the 15-minute opening. I find that really helps, and it doesn't mean having to remove garments and do the whole MLD routine. Hope everything clears up quickly today. Keep us posted, Hugs, Binney ",

It's a decision women need to make in consultation with their doctors, always assuming they feel comfortable discussing the evidence and limitations of the current research as it applies to their own specific situation. My point is, making any decision based on fear of lymphedema is unnecessary, and possibly dangerous. It's a moot point: we're all at risk. If it happens to you, the risk was 100%. All lymphedema risk rates, by the way, are flawed because there is no agreed upon basis for diagnosis, and therefore no way to make sense of any study without consideration of how they've defined lymphedema, much less to compare studies and arrive at any broad concensus about lymphedema rates. There are serious researchers who believe the rate of lymphedema following ALND is actually higher than that, and other researchers who think the rates quoted for risk following SNB are way too low, especially since they don't reflect the increased risk of truncal lymphedema that appears to be developing with the use of lumpectomy/SNB/rads. Unlike most arm lymphedema, truncal lymphedema is often quite painful, and it goes undiagnosed for longer periods than arm lymphedema, so very frequently results in serious repeated infection. So once again, my point is that we're smart women, aware of our lymphedema risk (whatever the actual percentages may be), and free to make important but very individual decisions about how best to protect ourselves, both before and after surgery and other treatment. We are also free to make our breast cancer treatment decisions apart from fear of lymphedema risk, as the two are separate issues. We have no need to be haunted by pictures of out-of-control lymphedema in some unfortunate woman who was not informed of her risk or offered the prompt treatment she deserved (though perhaps we do have an implied obligation to spread lymphedema awareness to our doctors, fellow bc Sisters, and the community at large). To that end, both the StepUp-SpeakOut site and the National Lymphedma Network site offer risk reduction guidelines we can all consider. I hope none of you ever have to join our Sisterhood of Swell.

Binney European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery Available online 8 January 2013 Complications of Autologous Lymph-node Transplantation for Limb Lymphoedema ·         S. Vignes, , M. Blanchard, A. Yannoutsos, M. Arrault Department of Lymphology, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Vasculaires Rares (lymphœdèmes primaires), Hôpital Cognacq-Jay, 15, rue Eugène Millon, 75015 Paris, France Objective This study aims to assess potential complications of autologous lymph-node transplantation (ALNT) to treat limb lymphoedema. Design Prospective, observational study. Method All limb-lymphoedema patients, followed up in a single lymphology department, who decided to undergo ALNT (January 2004\u2013June 2012) independently of our medical team, were included. Results Among the 26 patients (22 females, four males) included, 14 had secondary upper-limb lymphoedema after breast-cancer treatment and seven had secondary and five primary lower-limb lymphoedema. Median (interquartile range, IQR) ages at primary lower-limb lymphoedema and secondary lymphoedema onset were 18.5 (13\u201330) and 47.4 (35\u201358) years, respectively. Median body mass index (BMI) was 25.9 (22.9\u201329.3) kg m−2. For all patients, median pre-surgery lymphoedema duration was 37 (24\u201390) months. Thirty-four ALNs were transplanted into the 26 patients, combined with liposuction in four lower-limb-lymphoedema patients. Ten (38%) patients developed 15 complications: six, chronic lymphoedema (four upper limb, two lower limb), defined as ≥2-cm difference versus the contralateral side, in the limb on the donor lymph-node-site territory, persisting for a median of 40 months post-ALNT; four, post-surgical lymphocoeles; one testicular hydrocoele requiring surgery; and four with persistent donor-site pain. Median (IQR) pre- and post-surgical lymphoedema volumes, calculated using the formula for a truncated cone, were, respectively, 1023 (633\u20131375) ml (median: 3 (1\u20136) months) and 1058 (666\u20131506) ml (median: 40 (14\u201372) months; P = 0.73). Conclusion ALNT may engender severe, chronic complications, particularly persistent iatrogenic lymphoedema. Further investigations are required to evaluate and clearly determine its indications.

So the delivery of any medication in that area is unpredictable at best. You want your chemo drugs delivered as efficiently as possible, and a sluggish vasculature is not efficient. So, yeah, a port would be a good idea. Talk to your doctors about which side to use, if you have a choice, as the one at least risk for LE is the better side (least nodes removed or least swelling currently).

That's why your therapist won't fit you for garments until she's gotten the swelling down first. The night garments act like the bandages and usually help bring the swelling down instead of just containing it.

In fact, it's been a huge disappointment in terms of what we'd hoped it would do to help with LE diagnosis and follow-up, and to standardize LE diagnosis criteria. But the company, Impedimed, has continued to hawk it to doctors and hospitals with an advertising campaign that is at best seriously misleading. They even have a website that poses as a patient site, where patients were encouraged to tell about their own LE experiences, but the whole site was very heavily slanted toward advertising the L-Dex--including their \"informative\" videos. Nowhere on their site did they acknowledge that it was a commercial site or that they sponsored it, so several of us here put pressure on them about their cover-up and eventually they were at least forced to post an acknowledgement of ownership on their site. Beyond that they won't go, so the site remains, obstensibly offering LE information and advice, but all of it slanted toward their product. They even have a listing of so-called \"LE-knowledgeable\" doctors that they refer patients to, but it's actually just a list of doctors who have bought L-Dex machines. There are new technologies being developed that I hope will soon put these folks out of business, but until then it's important not to trust to L-dex results for a true picture of ones own LE condition. It's okay to use in conjunction with other measurement techniques (tapemeasure, perometer, even water displacement), but as a stand-alone it tells you very little, and not near enough to judge your condition. Ooh! Kinda hit a sore spot! Okay, I'll just jump down off my soapbox now--sorry for the rant, but hope it helps keep everyone on course with their LE control! Hugs, Binney",

Others can get away with no compression at night and only wear it in the daytime. Still others were religious about bandaging and compression garments initially and then eventually found their lymph systems had found other ways to compensate and they could back off on compression. We're all different. On the other thread where you posted this I suggested how you might experiment with it safely if your LE is stable. It's an older study, at any rate, and has been superceded by more recent work--as was suggested in the author's conclusion. Be well! Binney",

The first two market through second-parties, including some therapists, and in the past have been inclined to pressure patients to some degree, so their marketing is a bit murky. Flexitouch has a great deal of research to back their product, some of it not even commissioned by them! Because of the pressure that has been a part of this business, do be sure to request a demo of a couple of them, which can be done at your therapist's office or your home. Flexitouch is generally considered to be the best for bc-related LE because it clears the entire trunk area and because the research is more extensive. It is also expensive, but if you request their help they will deal with your insurance company themselves. On the other hand, there are women here who use the other brands as well and have had good results, so it's your call, but you'll want to be an informed shopper by trying them out before you commit to any one of them. Advantages are as you note--it reaches the back even when DH is away. It is not, though, a replacement for a hands-on therapist visit, so I have less confidence in that as a reason to use it. It's a replacement for your own at-home self-MLD, NOT for a therapist. It can't evaluate, sense changes under the skin, or offer the on-going advice we need with this chronic condition. The major disadvantage women note is that it's time-consuming, moreso than self MLD. (A more minor issue is that it takes up a lot of space in your home!)

I'm so sorry about all the contortions and grief involved in this rotten diagnosis. It's hard to make room in our lives for this, but it's possible, and you're doing really wonderfully! (But then, judging by your tag-line about gratitude, joy, and prayer, maybe that's not so surprising). Give yourself plenty of room. I have the kind of sleeve you do, and I don't find it a very good substitute for wrapping unless I catch a flare early. For initial therapy it would not have worked for me at all. I needed to wrap. There is little that's more important to on-going self care than being able to wrap yourself, so even though it's a bit like climbing Mt. Everest, the view from the top is empowering. Practice--even through the tears and the thrown bandages--and you'll be incredibly proud of your accomplishment and confidant of your ability to care for yourself. By way of encouragement--and maybe challenge--I have bilateral LE and sometimes have to wrap both arms myself. I start with the right because I'm right-handed, and then I wrap the left arm using my already-wrapped right hand. I'm incredibly glad that I stuck with it and learned to do it, and you can too! The Flexi is generally considered the best pump out there, and it has the most research results, so if you're interested in a pump that's the one to go with. But you need to know that a pump is NOT a substitute for either professional therapy or wrapping. It is only a substitude for self-MLD at home (which you also need to know how to do and be good at, so you will always have that skill available even when the pump is not). All that just to say that a three-week wait is not a problem, because you will be doing your own self-massage during that time so you won't lose any ground. Drawbacks to a pump are that it's bulky to use and to store between uses, and it takes a full hour of your day, during which it's hard (impossible) to do anything else (except maybe watch TV). So before pursuing that you need to be sure you can make time for that in your life. Self-MLD can take an hour, too, but it can also take as little as 15 minutes, and it's portable, while a pump ties you down to one place. Advantages are it's always consistent in timing and compression, so even when you're stressed or feeling rushed it continues to deliver the slow, gentle technique. And in your case, it's certainly effective. Hang tough! Hugs and prayers, Binney",

Too tight above the elbow, maybe, so it's pushing fluid lower? Bummer, at any rate. My therapist pointed out that I was compression sensitive because when she wrapped normally my arm didn't get better. She tried a gentler wrap and it took the swelling right down. But I've had to do a lot of trial and error to figure out how in the world to cope with this. Heavier fabric garments turn my fingertips unhealthy colors (white, red, blue--cold!), even if the fit is loose. Experimenting around with this gets expensive fast, but once you hit on a strategy that works for you it's so much easier to maintain control. As for wrapping, if I'm in too much of hurry, or if I'm feeling panicky about a flare and sorta desperate to get the swelling down, I tend to wrap too tight--and then I have to start over and do it right. Just on a side note, it seems to me from the women who've found that \"less is more\" with compression are most often of a slight build, which makes sense in terms of the physics of compressing a cylinder (which is what our arms are). I hope others will chime in, as this is a subject that's not often discussed, or even acknowledged. Hugs, Binney",

Awhile back one of our gals here closely missed being smacked by a tornado and came here to report that the approaching storm had caused disabling pain and swelling in her arm. (This would be due to the sudden changes in atmospheric pressure which directly affect lymphedema. Most of us are more familiar with changes of altitude affecting our LE control, but that too has to do with pressure change, so it's a similar effect.) I have no idea how an approaching hurricane would affect someone with LE, but almost certainly the atmospheric pressure would be a factor. Once the storm passes control should return to \"normal,\" but the immediate loss of control could be confusing (and frightening!) if you aren't expecting it. Another aspect of weather emergencies is all these images we've been seeing of evacuees wading through waist-deep water, which brings to mind the importance of planning what to bring with you to a shelter or wherever you're heading to get out of harm's way. Be sure to include at least a couple changes of day garments and a night garment or wrapping supplies (and instructions for wrapping if you haven't practiced it in a while!) And don't forget your kit for dealing with cuts and scratches: wet wipes for cleaning, topical antibiotic, bandaids and, if you have them, a supply of oral antibiotics as prescribed by your doctor in case of suspected cellulitis. Put all that in a waterproof bag, for sure. A sturdy ziplock bag with as much air as possible left in it when sealing it may help keep it afloat if it gets dropped. When Hurricane Andrew hit in Florida (goodness, have I been hanging out around here that long!!), one of our gals in the affected area had just started her LE treatment with a therapist there. The hospital where she was going for treatment was flooded, but the PT found another building, invited all her patients to meet there, and with her supervision they practiced their MLD and wrapping on each other until her clinic was again operable. Her treatment went forward uninterrupted despite the chaos of the storm. Or, as Mr. Rogers so wisely put it, in any disaster, \"look for the helpers.\" Creative thinking and compassion go hand in hand to find solutions that inspire us all! For those of you facing the imminent arrival of Hurricane Irma, my thoughts and prayers are with you--stay safe! Thanks to anyone who can add ideas for coping in extreme events.

I have no idea whether the position of the sentinal node would determine whether or not anyone was at risk for truncal or arm LE, but it sure would be interesting to find out. I think this relates in some way to the new ARM (Axillary Reverse Mapping) procedure that identifies the node that drains the arm before surgery, in the same way that the SNB identifies the node that drains the tumor. We were discussing it a couple of months ago on the \"Help Me Get Through Treatment\" board, so I'll copy what I wrote there: It works on the principle that there is one crucial lymph node (or small set of nodes) that controls the draining of lymph from the arm. If surgeons can identify that node and leave it alone, the arm lymphatics remain intact. It resembles the SNB in that dye is injected (into the arm in this case) before surgery to identify the crucial node. Then, assuming it's not also the Sentinal Node and it's cancer free, they can leave the poor thing alone and improve our prospects of living swell-free. Nice! Anyhow, here are a couple of articles about it. Maybe taking copies to your surgeon will get you some further information. Surgeon Develops Procedure to Prevent Arm Swelling in Breast Cancer Patients 16 March 2007 http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/528155/ Axillary Reverse Mapping: Mapping and Preserving Arm Lymphatics May Be Important in Preventing Lymphedema During Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy December 2007 http://www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-7515(07)01983-7/abstract  There are very few doctors doing this procedure yet, but hopefully it'll prove valuable in ways the SNB did not (the SNB does decrease the incidence of arm LE somewhat, but not nearly as much as everyone expected it would.) Lot's of exciting things going on in LE care just now. Hard to keep up with it all but, Jane, you're right out there with the best of 'em! Be well, Binney ",

Just have to keep in mind that the thigh is considered a \"lagging\" test site for blood sugars--in other words readings from the thigh might be 20-30 minutes behind the actual blood glucose level. Not a problem if you're testing regularly and blood sugars don't do sudden drops. Our youngest daughter's diabetes has always been unpredictable, with sudden drops, even at night (aaaaaugh!) that can't really be accounted for. She now has an alert dog, whose alerts to both highs and lows are thankfully incredibly accurate and fast. In fact, a good alert dog can detect dangerous blood glucose changes sooner than a Continuous Monitor. Of course she still has to do blood tests to verify and track--sigh! A cure sure would be nice!

(I want to point out that Avon works with Johns Hopkins, so I alerted them to this problem, but they ALSO support important lymphedema research -- THANK YOU, AVON!!!) Then, if we're petitioning bc.org, perhaps we should include a mandate to update the LE information on their patient information pages -- which is flawed and outdated -- preferably by someone actually in the LE field -- Jane Armer (researcer), Dr. Kathleen Francis (lymphologist), Jodi Winicour (PT and therapist trainer with a specialty in post-bc LE) come to mind. Natsfan and Missrwe, thank you for your input on this. I think we tend to confuse \"excellent cancer center\" with \"excellent follow-up care\" -- they are clearly not the same thing. As long as doctors are not taught anything (or way too little) about LE no cancer center (which is staffed, after all, by these LE-undertrained doctors) is going to come up with improvements on their own. So anything you (and all of us) can do to alert them to our need (and our determination to have it met) will do wonders for grabbing their attention. But it won't be an easy task. Lymphedema has been shucked under the carpet for a very long time, and despite the numbers of people suffering from it, no patient movement has ever been launched. UNTIL NOW!  For many years Pat O'Connor, the founder of LymphedemaPeople.com and a lifetime sufferer of primary (genetic) lymphedema, has worked to make people with lymphedema aware that they are not alone, and that there is treatment available. (Primary lymphers typically wait decades for a proper diagnosis, so compared to them we're way out ahead!) People with ymphedema -- because it is disfiguring and because doctors have so long disregarded it -- have been hiding out, many not willing to leave their homes, others so wearied with trying to get help that they are completely shut down. They have been in no shape to launch an awareness campaign or to insist that misinformation and ignorance in the medical community come to an end.  On the professional side, Saskia Thiadens founded the National Lymphedema Network, whose primary contribution has been (and still is) reaching out to the medical community to educate and to support those working in therapy and research. Their International Conference (coming up in September in Orlando) brings together lymphedema professionals from all over the world to share ideas, conduct workshops and present new research. What the organization has lacked all these years is any movement among lymphedema patients to advocate for themselves. In other words, I do think we're in a good place RIGHT NOW to make our voices heard. As Kane has pointed out elsewhere, we're standing on the shoulders of the women before us who made breast cancer itself into a cause that everyone is now aware of and that reaps gazillions every year in research funding. As we move forward with this, let's keep in mind that bc-related lymphedema is only one part of the picture. Our sisters with gynecologic cancers (and our men-folk with prostate cancer), as well as everyone with head and neck cancers and melanoma are at risk, and they receive less help than we do. Those with Primary Lymphedema include new-borns, youngsters, teens, young adults, and the elderly. Their voices are never heard, and we need to keep them with us as we make progress toward awareness. So, all suggestions welcome. We'll post here as soon as we hear from any of our emails.  Wow! Binney",

Lillie claims that out of 3,800 women who have had an SNB at Johns Hopkins, only one has ever developed lymphedema. That means their LE rate following SNB is less than .03%. Elsewhere in the world, according to published research, the rate is somewhere between almost 7% and 41%. If we compare these two figures, using the lowest (7%) rate reported, that means patients everywhere but Johns Hopkins have 260 times the risk of developing LE after an SNB than do patients at that venerable institution. Ladies, that is either an outright miracle, or it's absolute rubbish. If it is a miracle, than Johns Hopkins owes ALL OF US the secret information about LE prevention that they are hoarding from the rest of the world. And if it is rubbish then Lillie needs to clean up her act immediately. We are all suffering from a SERIOUS medical condition, Lillie, and the games you are playing with us are NOT ACCEPTABLE.

Just wanted to add on the subject of what to do in the kitchen, that the one thing we can say for LE being chronic is that we do end up with \"old\" gloves that still have a bit of life left in them. I use them for wet or messy jobs, then dry my hands well, lotion, and put the newer dry ones back on when I'm done. My hands get wet, of course, but they're not steaming in the plastic and they don't stay wet for long. I'm trying out a Juzo OTC glove called \"Cool Vent\" that has air vents on palm and back of hand. It's comfortable, but I haven't had a really hot day since I got it to see how it works. I'll try it out today with a plastic glove and see if it cuts down on the sweat factor (my regular gloves are soaked in minutes if I use plastic over them).

Wore my regular (Gottfried) glove on one hand and the Cool-vent on the other (I'm bilateral), with plastic food-service gloves over both. After 20 minutes the Gottfried was wet all over (which I expected since that's why I don't use food-service gloves). The Cool-vent was dry on both back and palm side of my hand, and very slightly damp on my fingers only. So I'm thinking it actually works in terms of ventilation. Interesting! And it's a thicker fabric than the Gottfried, too, so I was actually surprised. It's even kinda pretty, with the diamond-shaped vent sections--and the color is a bit darker than \"medical beige ugly\" too. I believe it comes in a gauntlet-like thing and a short-fingered glove (I have the glove). Since my fingertips don't swell (unless my glove fits too tight at the top) the shorter fingers don't bother me (they come to just a bit below the top knuckle, rather than just below the nail bed), but if anyone had fingertip issues this style might not work for them. As for it being great for the desert, that's my thought exactly. I see my therapist and my fitter soon and I'll certainly take it along and show it to them. (But in terms of \"a dream in Arizona heat\", what I dream of is not wearing any compression garments at all--sigh!) Gotta love all this \"research\" we all do!

The idea of a compression sleeve is that it has gradually less compression as it goes up your arm. In other words, most compression in hand, least up near the axilla. And some of us need a size \"long\" in order to get the sleeve to come up high enough near our axilla. Best not to wear something that fits poorly, as it can cause pooling in your hand and/or forearm. Most compression garments come as separate sleeve and glove (or gauntlet). I've never seen a one-piece sleeve/glove, just a sleeve/gauntlet, but maybe someone else here has and will be along to tell us about it. Ordering custom garments is a good way to go, but you do need a good fitter to do the measuring. It doesn't sound like your present therapist has much to offer by way of measuring and fitting--is there a DME supplier nearby that might have someone trained to do it?

It had nothing to do with lymphedema. Spas started offering \"lymph massage\" which was by no means the same thing as MLD. It was a part of the \"clear the toxins from your body\" movement, and it took off in that way that pop-health ideas often do. So an exercise program that claims to have \"benefits for the lymph system\" is not addressed to people with lymphedema, but to anyone who's into that popular conception about clearing toxins. Which of course the lymph system does. And muscle movement is a huge part of how it pumps lymph fluid. But then, any muscle movement will do that, so the specific claims of an exercise system like this is mostly funky fun. It's got nothing to do with lymphedema, MLD, or even with the kinds of exercises (like the Norton or Lebed routines) that actually help direct fluid movement. Still, exercising alone can be a drag, and a lot of us count on classes to keep us motivated. The whole issue is to choose a class that will do that without messing up the LE. Or to choose one that MOSTLY doesn't mess up the LE and then modify the parts that do.  (For me, in a class setting, it's hard to be the only one who is leaving out the parts that bug my LE, but maybe that's just me.)

Once I get my notes sorted out I may be able to pass on a bit more information about it, but off the top of my head what stands out for me was that there are two distinct sorts of cording. One very thick cord might be a form of phlebitis of a superficial vein - in other words, an inflammation of a vein near the surface of the skin. If there are more, smaller \"cords\", or a single smaller one, those are more likely to be (at least partially) inflammed lymph vessels. They're both painful and limiting, and they both respond to gentle stretching, especially in a warm (not hot!) shower. And they both clear up eventually. Yes! Since some therapists talk about \"snapping\" these cords for immediate relief, I was interested to hear one lecturer telling therapists to try to avoid snapping them, but simply to help ease the discomfort by stretching. She felt that snapping them might be more likely to lead to (or worsen) LE. The stretching she suggested for therapists to use involved gently flexing the arm while she applied some soft tissue manipulation. Looked comfortable to me, and she emphasized not doing anything that was painful. Well, good! I like that line of thinking! Tomatojuice, please keep us posted. Thinking of you! Binney  ",

She had a lot of excellent advice, and she's definitely in a good place there, helping out BEFORE the lymphedema is diagnosed. Why not pass all our thoughts along to her (if you thik she'd be receptive) and see what she has to say. I can tell you from my own personal experience that my LE started in my right hand because I flew on a long trip with only a sleeve (that on the advice of an under-trained therapist -- aaugh!) Since then I've found a therapist with more than 14 years experience and she's seen plenty of women who've had the same problem, so perhaps the therapist you saw simply hasn't seen that happen. Bobbie, I agree completely -- every one of us is different in what our bodies can handle after treatment, and nobody can predict it. Your plan sounds really sound. Let us know how it goes! It's so great to be at a place where you can think about really regaining the strength you've spent on treatment. Hooray! Sounds like you're really tuned into your body, and that's what it takes. Lori, I don't think there's any arbitrary limit anyone can apply to \"safe\" weight lifting. It depends on so many factors, some of them unfortunately not yet identified. It does help if you were doing the exercises before treatment, but even that is no guarantee. In April the bc.org \"Ask the Experts\" on-line conference will feature a LE researcher who's been doing studies on LE and weight training -- and finding that, with proper care and precautions, weight training is actually helpful to both prevention and control of LE. Should be really interesting. Get your questions ready! Be well, Binney ",

Seromas do get worse when you exercise, but they don't get better if you elevate your arm. But lymphedema (LE) sure does act like that, so it's possible you have some LE there. An experienced LE therapist can help you understand what's going on and how to relieve it. If it's not LE (and I hope it's not !) she can give you some tips for preventing it in the future. For a well-trained LE therapist near you, use the Therapist Locator here: www.mylymphedema.com. And for some solid information on LE, here's the National Lymphedema Network - their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel are especially helpful: www.lymphnet.org.  Sure hoping you get both answers and relief today!

Here's how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Dr.Kathryn Schmitz recently published a study in the New England Journal of Medicine about weightlifting with lymphedema. It was specifically about women who already have lymphedema, but you might find it interesting. Following their suggestions for proceeding very slowly and paying close attention to your body may be helpful as guidelines for how to start back. You can find links to the whole article, Dr. Schmitz's corrections about media misrepresentation of her findings, and even the weight-lifting protocol followed in her study here: http://www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQs/weightliftingLE.htm Here are two sites with information about reducing your risk of lymphedema: http://www.lymphnet.org  (see their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Travel) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Hmmmm. Ask a simple question, get enough reading material to make your eyes blurry! Hope some of it helps! Sorry, but I can't answer expander questions either. Others should be along soon, or check out the forums here on Fitness or Reconstruction. Be well! Binney",

Not to mention mighty uncomfortable. Here are a couple of suggestions you can try. As I recall you've already seen an OT who agreed there was edema but didn't do much about it. But whether it's breast lymphedema or a hematoma or a seroma, a well-trained lymphedema therapist should be able to help you get the fluid out more efficiently. S/he should be doing lymphedema massage on you at least several times a week, teaching you to do a simple version of it yourself, and generally supervising your recovery. So if the one you saw isn't going to do that, you might want to find one who will. Here are a couple of web sites for finding a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you. When you get a referral (from any doctor on your team) and call, make sure s/he has had a lot of experience with breast lymphedema and is comfortable dealing with it: www.mylymphedema.com   (Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links.) www.clt-lana.org  (Click on \"LANA certified therapists\" on the left-hand side.) You don't  say what you're doing for a bra or compression, but gentle compression may well help with both the discomfort and the swelling. Especially if you're doing some massage, compression can help keep any fluid you move out of the area from returning. Here's one solution, a breast binder that's adjustable and comfortable: http://www.breastbinders.com/Store/catalog/Traditional_Breast_Binders-1-1.html Any supportive compression may help, even a good sports bra, but they can be difficult to fit with uneven breasts. Deep abdominal breathing several times a day will help, and lowering your salt intake may help too. Drink plenty so you stay well hydrated. And for goodness sake do keep us posted on what you discover. Very gentle (((((hugs!))))), Binney",

Whether it's all seroma, or part lymphedema, gentle lymphatic massage really can help to relieve both swelling and pain, so I'd still suggest you get it evaluated by a well-qualified lymphedema therapist. As for using a heating pad, if there's a component of lymphedema here the heat may actually draw more fluid to the site, and you don't want that to happen. So if you're using heat to relieve the pain, keep it no hotter than around 104 degrees. At least it appears you're certainly not alone. Misery may love company, but it loves getting rid of the pain a whole lot more! I hope you're not worried because you haven't cried through all this. That's one way some of us cope -- we focus straight ahead and buckle down to doing all the things we need to do, and falling apart simply doesn't fit the need at the moment. You'll cope with the emotional aspects of all this just fine as soon as you feel \"safe\" enough.

Some people take off on their \"myth busting\" agendas by overstating the findings and underemphasizing the protections that should be in place. For some reason I don't understand, ever since Katy Schmitz's first weight-lifting exercise study was published there's been a push in some quarters to debunk risk reduction measures. I can appreciate the enthusiasm, but the direction it takes is dangerous. Too often our health-care providers read these kinds of rants (like I found so easily) and don't do the hard work of analyzing the study itself, and then they tell their patients to go out there and exercise without offering any guidelines for easing into it. Then when LE develops, it's a nasty surprise. We've also had problems with some employers hearing of these things and then telling their employees with LE that they should be able to lift any weight and so remove job protections that should be in place. Too many people with their own agendas! Please do feel welcome to keep us informed, Hildy. Hugs, Binney",

The swelling that your doctor was able to drain is fairly common after our surgeries. It's called a seroma, and it's a pocket of fluid, a sort of \"pond\" that's all collected in one spot. If it's not painful doctors usually just leave it alone for the body to re-absorb. I had painful seromas after my second mastectomy that had to be drained several times. Hopefully Kira will be along shortly - she's a seroma expert, unfortunately. Lymphedma is different -- it's fluid that is NOT in a handy little pond. It's all over around the cells in what's called the \"interstitial tissue.\" Basically that means in whatever wee spots it can get. It can't be drained with a needle because it's not all collected in one place. So getting the lymph fluid out of the tissue in lymphedema requires stimulating the remaining sluggish nodes and vessels so they'll get back to the work they're designed to do. That takes a very gentle directional massage that moves the fluid in the right direction in small, slow increments. And using compression bandages and garments to help keep the pressure on and the fluid moving. So a seroma is usually easier to manage. But the problem is that it's been connected with later development of lymphedema, so you might want to be more aggressive about getting early lymphedema care. Ask your doctor (and good for him for knowing about lymphedema!) for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist now -- for evaluation, baseline measurements, learning prophylactic massage, tips for reducing your risk, and fitting for any garments you need to help keep it at bay. Here's a page from the StepUp-SpeakOut site for finding qualifed therapists near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Hope that helps, and prayers for a smooth and entirely successful surgery!

(But hey! congrats on that!) Unfortunately the risk of lymphedema following breast cancer doesn't have any expiration date. Here's a brief run-down of the mechanics of it: your body considers tattoos a trauma, and it's response is to send plenty of extra lymph fluid to the area (which is what causes post-injury swelling). That's because the lymph system is a sort of garbage pick-up arrangement that gathers up intruding bacteria, dead cells and other cellular gunk and carries it back to the nodes to be disabled or killed outright. With your lymph system compromised, this flood of lymph fluid can overwhelm the system and trigger lymphedema. Skin breaks of any kind can also allow bacteria to enter, and if the lymph system is a bit sluggish, result in serious infection called cellulitis. (Interesting factoid: tattoo ink that leaves the area of the tattoo and travels through the system will end up in the lymph nodes, where it remains forever, as it can't be destroyed. As far as anyone knows that is not a problem, just a curious bit of biological functioning.) Still, we all make our own compromises with perceived risks, so here are some precautions you might consider if you decide to go ahead with a tattoo on your affected arm: 1. Ask any doctor on your healthcare team for a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for baseline arm measurements and a personalized risk assessment. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified... 2. Consider a short-term round of oral antibiotics to offer protection from the higher risk of infection that you will face. 3. Do everything you can to keep normal post-tattoo swelling under control. Make sure you have a plan for this for several days following, and the supplies (ice packs, whatever) to carry it out. 4. Be familiar with the signs of cellulitis and if you suspect that may be developing, act quickly! Here are some guidelines: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Emergencies_and_Med...

I have truncal LE that is VERY painful--even in the past fairly disabling. The pain of truncal lymphedema doesn't respond to OTC pain meds (probably because it's actually nerve pain), and it can be very hard to pinpoint--whenever I'd try to point to the exact area where it hurt, it would seem to move around and be somewhere else. Lymphedema can develop after ANY chest/breast surgery, even without cancer being involved at all. Breast augmentation and reduction both can lead to this complication. Any trauma can, in fact, such as an auto accident. Football players sometimes develop lymphedema from the effect of being repeatedly battered in the chest by other players. So certainly it's possible that this is lymphedema. It CAN be effectively treated with Manual Lymph Drainage massage by a well-trained lymphedema therapist. Here's how to find one near you: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin...\u2026 Any doctor on your team can write you a referral. Call therapists you're considering and ask how much experience they've had treating truncal lymphedema, as that can be a real help in deciding who to see. It's always hard for me to \"see\" my truncal swelling just by eye-balling it, and it can be hard for doctors as well. I know when it's flaring because of the pain, not anything I see. Treating it myself with self-Manual Lymph Drainage and adequate compression brings it back into control and relieves the pain. One thing women sometimes do notice with truncal lymphedema is that when they take off their bra it leaves long-lasting indentations in the skin where the straps or bottom band were, so that's how some gauge whether they're dealing with truncal lymphedema or not.  I use a compression cami by WearEase called a Slimmer. It gives good coverage both across the back and under the arm. I also have a night vest made of doubled fabric stuffed with foam chips that is very effective in keeping my truncal swelling in control. When it flares I use small pads called \"Swell Spots\" in the area of the pain to quickly bring down the swelling. So there are a lot of resources you'll discover for keeping this under control once you get it diagnosed and treated. Please keep us posted on what you discover, and tell us how we can help.

As Jen suggests, it's so soon after your surgery the swelling may well be expected still from that. Still, I take it that this came on rather suddenly, so there are other possibilities to consider, and lymphedema (LE) is one of them. Some of us have back swelling, though we usually have breast or chest swelling as well. When you have LE in your chest or side or back, it's often quite painful. If that's the case, a well-trained LE therapist can get the swelling down and teach you how to keep it that way, so you're not looking at permanent swelling or pain. Whenever there's new swelling and the possibility of LE exists, a thorough doctor may do some tests to rule out other possibilities before shipping you off to a LE therapist. So when you see your doctor, don't be alarmed if s/he orders scans and/or doppler imaging to rule out other things that could cause new swelling (like blood clots). This is a routine matter and offers you (and your doctor!) protection from a muffed diagnosis. In the meantime, there are a few things you might try that might give you some relief. Elevating your arm (on the back of the couch while you talk or watch TV, on pillows at night) can help the fluid drain. Drink plenty of water (that dilutes the lymph fluid and makes it easier to move). Cut back on salt. If you have a tight leo or sports shirt, and if it's comfortable, wear it inside out (so the seams don't press into your skin) and see if that helps with the discomfort. You can wear it at night too if it seems to help. Deep breathing is one way to help move lymph fluid, so big breaths in through your nose, letting your tummy expand, then gently exhale through your mouth. Do it a few times in a row whenever you think of it. The one thing you want to watch for is any sign of infection on your arm or trunk -- redness, warmth to the touch, fever, unexplained itching. If you notice anything like that, get help immediately -- don't wait on that, because infection in the presence of lymphedema can worsen quickly and spread rapidly. Do try to rest and not panic too much. You really will have answers and relief in short order, so do your best to put the worry aside and give your body the rest it needs tonight. And do come back and keep us posted! Big, gentle (((((hugs!))))) Binney ",

YES!! The plan makes sense to me, but it means you'll need to be vigilant and to stay in contact with her. Any questions or concerns, see her right away. You're in a field that can result in nicks and burns on your hand and fingers, so you'll also want to keep topical antibiotic handy. Wash any nicks at once and apply antibiotic, and do your best to keep the area clean until it heals. It's hard to stop and do that in the middle of your work, but avoiding an infection is definitely worth it. Do please keep us posted. Really happy you're in such good hands! Gentle hugs, Binney Edited to add: Other helps throughout the day would be to stay really well hydrated and to remember to take a few deep abdominal breaths between customers.",

That really was a nightmare, and I'm so glad you're climbing up out of it now. For some people repeat cellulitis is a real problem, and help from an infectious disease specialist is in order. But fortunately that's not where you're at yet. Because for other people that first bout of cellulitis is the last, or at least the worst. Now that you know the feeling of infection coming on you'll act quicker and start with the antibiotics as soon as possible, and that will hopefully help too. Once the infection's in control you can use massage and compression again with good effect. As for biking, I don't know if it could be part of the cause, but I know I can't bike very far without it affecting my LE (but we're all different, of course). I did look into those grips you can put on handlebars so you're not leaning on your arms, but I'm not enough of a biker to invest in them. They make you sit up a bit more, so they're not as efficient for distance riding, but they take the stress off your arm. I like Kira's idea of a recumbant bike, but that's a whole 'nother ballgame.

As much as 30% more fluid than is normal can be hiding out  in your tissues before any swelling is visible, so that's what probably accounts for those early feelings. There's some evidence that if you use a sleeve and glove at the sub-clinical stage you may never need the more intensive therapy (wrapping and a couple of weeks of therapist massage.) So a sleeve and glove (well-fitted!) would be a good idea. I believe they recommend wearing them for most of the day for a couple of weeks, then only when you notice tingling, puffiness or that full feeling, or swelling -- or when you exercise, travel, or do unusual activities. Learning the self-massage for LE will also be an important step toward preventing progression and knowing how to deal with any symptoms, so do have her teach you. Decreasing the scarring should have some effect on lymph flow, but it won't be permanent, so do pursue your options for preventing any more puffiness. LE is a steep learning curve, for sure. Who ever even though about their lymph system before? Keep us posted, as sharing information helps us all to learn! Binney",

But YES, get the fit checked and corrected. The finger spacers can really irritate the delicate webs between fingers if they're too long, so get that fixed. There's nothing wrong with some fluff in your palm, but it shouldn't be necessary to use it in order to get a great fit. They can sew in a palm pad, so have them do that. As for it sliding down at night, I don't know because my sleeves are snapped at the shoulder to my night vest (truncal lymphedema too), but it doesn't sound good to me. Hopefully other Solaris users will be along with their experiences.  If you don't need a compression garment part of the day, then you don't need it. But if you're not going to wear it all the time, then you'll want to figure out when you do need it and when you don't. If your arm was starting to ache at 6 PM, then you went too long without it. You want to wear it BEFORE it starts to be symptomatic. That might mean wearing it when you'll be outside in the heat, when you're doing housework or other heavy work, when you're traveling, when you're exercising, or even when there's a storm coming. It all depends on what affects YOU. Be well! Binney",

This doesn't tell us, for instance, if there was a control group and, if so, how they fared with quantitative reduction. It also doesn't explain what method was used to obtain measurements, whether the measuring methods were consistent over the course of the study or done by different therapists under varying conditions--and as we all know only too well, that can be a huge variable! It doesn't note what other interventions were used during the follow-up period (were these patients concurrently wearing garments, seeing therapists for MLD, doing self-mld, using pumps, getting regular exercise, etc., and had they been doing so before the surgery or not?) And it doesn't record any side-effects, though we do know some are possible with this surgery. Reading the full study would help us interpret these results in a more helpful context. Hopefully we'll be able to get a hold of the full study to answer some of these questions. (BTW, Dr. Chang is no longer with MD Anderson--I understand he's moved to the University of Chicago.)

If you're using a 20-30 sleeve and it's working for you, that's a class 2 from this company. My personal dilemma is that the usual 20-30 is a bit much for me -- less is more for my LE -- I order custom garments for that reason. So I'm wondering if the bilateral sleeve would actually work for me, but it's an expensive experiment. Anybody know what their return policy is?

Can you adjust the fabric around the elbow area so it has more \"give\" there? Okay, being a person for whom \"less is more\" where compression is concerned, I tried the SilverWave (in black -- lovely!) It is not sold as a compression sleeve for lymphedema, and that's wise, because it has a couple of design features that make it risky for LE use. The wrist area is long and tight, with a \"gathered\" effect above the cuff. It's beautiful and graceful styling, and I love it, but it leaves the area directly above the cuff completely uncompressed and open to collecting fluid. My gloves are made with very long cuffs, but not long enough to cover the uncompressed area. So I tried taking several tucks around the sleeve above the cuff to tighten it up. Works fairly well, but it's far from ideal and of course it didn't do anything good for the graceful style <sigh!> On the other hand, the fabric is so comfortable I don't even want to take it off. And the way the top of the sleeve goes around to my back and has no band around my upper arm does great things for my chest LE, which is aggravated by tightness in the underarm or upper arm. So I'm warily using it only occasionally, when I need some comfort and a break from the freakin' compression garments. Like the rest of you I would LOVE a long-sleeved T made out of this stuff, with a drop-shoulder so the seam doesn't catch me right in the axilla, y'know? LindaLou, I do appreciate your comments about the ArmCare band on the opposite arm. Since my LE is bilateral that would be a complete no-no for me <another sigh!> For now I'll just have to keep on fantasizing about the perfect LE compression garment for bilateral arm and chest LE, and in the meantime I'll be cheering for those of you who are able to use and enjoy these beautiful garments.

This sort of surgery has been tried for some time now, but the differences in pressure between the lymph system and the venous system make it a problem. I emailed Dr. Chang to ask how they deal with that issue, and several others that are raised by this procedure. As Dr. Chang suggests, it needs a lot more testing and long-term follow up before we'll know how hopeful a procedure it is. Actually, there's LOTS of new research going on for lymphedema right now, some of it really promising. Much of the work is spearheaded by the Lymphatic Research Foundation.

Leydi, whenever the lymph system has been compromised (as it has for all of us who have been treated for breast cancer) there can be considerable lymph fluid buildup in the tissues before there is any obvious, measurable swelling. It's called Stage 0, or pre-cliinical, lymphedema. It predisposes us to serious infection from any skin break--even paper cuts or insect bites--which is why your Point 1 is a factor. Point 2 is also a factor because even if you aren't dealing with preclinical lymphedema, if you should develop an infection, that itself could trigger lymphedema because it can overtax the already-compromised lymph system. Repeated insults to the lymph system can also accumulate and trigger lymphedema--some of the women who have posted here have developed lymphedema a couple of decades after their BC treatment. It never stops being a risk. As for \"will that suddenly change after BC surgery?\" as SummerAngel points out: not necessarily! Some of us have a more robust lymphatic system than others (though there's no simple way to determine who ahead of time). Like her, I had zero \"risk factors,\" but I did develop lymphedema, possibly because my own lymph system may not have been of the robust sort. Or possibly because we really don't know what all the risk factors are. Best bet is to ask for a referral from any of your doctors to a well-qualified lymphedema therapist, preferably before surgery. S/he can take baseline arm measurements for future reference and offer personalized risk-reduction suggestions. Here's how to find one near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified...

I'm jealous! Give that wee one a big old smoochie hug for me next time you get near enough! Okay, sorry. No, I really do hear you. The pain can't be ignored, though, because lymphedema can't be compared to the bc beast. Go get the PET scan, let 'em use the best-behaved of your arms, with the caveat that your vascular system doesn't work well in that arm so they may not get the results they want. Insist on their best nurse doing the IV, as little tourniquet use as possible, and no more than two tries before they go find somebody better to do it. Just make sure your arm's in as good control as you can get it before you go; take your bandages with you and wrap immediately after; and keep a close eye on the injection site for any sign of infection. Extra self-MLD both before and after will help, or make an appointment with your therapist for help within a day or two of the scan. In fact, if you have a decent therapist maybe she'd help you by consulting with your docs and their nurses over your realities and needs. Can't hurt to ask. As for blood pressure, how they expect to get a decent reading after hassling you is beyond me. Quiet, calm, lying prone for five minutes before they take it will help. Cranking you up with their idiot disapproval will not. When my onc's nurses don't want to take the time to do it correctly and calmly I refuse to let them do it at all. No point recording nonsense in my records. Here's the StepUp-SpeakOut section on leg blood pressure: www.stepup-speakout.org/How_Yo... And now that I think about it, there's a section on there about medical procedures on your affected arm, too -- might help with the PET scan: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/#GUIDELINES_FOR_SURGERY Hope the link works. Hope some of this helps. Hope most of all your leg pain turns out to be benignly fixable. Fuzzypeach, rant away -- we're all here for you, and we sure do get it. The lymphedema puts a damper on so many things. Sending you hugs and my hopes for better communication about your needs, somebody to do the icy sidewalks, and a swell-free day! Binney",

And by the way, I'm an adoptive mom too -- only mine are grown, some married and adopting kids of their own)  From your earlier post it seemed like you were thinking that with no positive nodes you'd have no risk for lymphedema (LE). But that isn't the case. You're at risk for arm and breast/chest LE (we all  are) even when only a single node is removed. Whether it's positive or negative for cancer makes no difference. It's the damage to the nodes and the lymph vessels that put us at risk. I wouldn't tell you that except that if you know you're at risk you can do some easy life-style things to reduce your risk, and I really want you to have that choice. The National Lymphedema Network has position papers on Risk Reduction, Exercise, and Air Travel here: www.lymphnet.org If you already have a good LE therapist for your foot LE, do make an appointment with her/him for early assessment, baseline arm measurements, instruction in upper-body lymphatic massage that you can use prophylactically to help keep it at bay, and fitting for a compression sleeve and glove to wear when traveling, exercising, or for any strenuous or unaccustomed activities. If you haven't yet been treated for the LE in your foot, a well-qualified LE therapist can help with that as well. Here are two web sites for finding one near you: www.mylymphedema.com (Click on the Therapist Locator and follow all the links) www.clt-lana.org Please also feel welcome to join us \"Sisters of Swell\" on the \"Lymphedema After Surgery\" board here at BreastCancer.org.

You might be able to judge swelling by the fit of your bra or cami, or any long-lasting indentations in your skin when you remove your bra/cami.

But the thing to keep in mind is that, even if it's just your hand or lower arm that's swollen, the actual damage to the lymph system is higher up, in the area of the axilla and chest. You don't want to push the swelling further up the arm unless it can actually return into circulation, up near your shoulder. So if you experiment with hand-only coverage, keep careful watch on your arm and axilla, and also on any rebound swelling in the hand that might be caused by fluid being moved, but not moved back into circulation.

In the beginning I almost didn't go to treatment after I'd fought like a mad woman to get a good therapist, because I was afraid I'd be so ashamed when she told me it was all in my head after all. When I took the referral in to make the appointment she was right there in the waiting room, and I said, as off-handedly as I could muster, \"Well, you know, I'm not real sure if it's even LE, but I thought I'd come in and get it checked out.\" She leaned toward me and said very quietly, \"You have LE, and we can help you.\" It was all I could do not to bust out in tears (did that when I got out to the car, though!) That limbo of having everyone else be oblivious to our reality makes it hard to stay in touch with reality. And then when we doubt it, it opens the door to others to doubt it too, which escalates the problem.  So there are still days when I think, \"This can't be!\" and I'll try going without my garments or starting a crochet project or whatever. And sure enough.... So I was really interested that you'd bring up your own self-doubts, because I struggle with that too. Hang tough! Binney",

Certainly wrapping your arm with short-stretch bandages (lightly at first) would be a much gentler way of approaching this, and would protect your hand as well. Do ask your therapist to help you with that. Do you have, among your team of doctors, an infectious disease specialist familiar with lymphedema? The considerations for those of us who have had repeat infections and have (or are at risk for) lymphedema are quite different than they might be for others. You may need low-dose antibiotics for longer than currently proposed, and other strategies may be considered as well to keep you out of this miserable cycle. Meanwhile, rest and PLENTY OF FLUIDS are still important so your body can fully recover. Gentle stretching exercises (as long as nothing hurts) could be helpful as well.

I have to agree with Carol that you need to think beyond just prevention at this point. The swelling you have already needs to be addressed for two reasons: getting it under control early means MUCH easier on-going care; and, stagnant lymph fluid creates a high infection risk (it's warm and protein-rich--bacteria love it!) The sleeve you have is heavy-duty, very possibly a lot more compression than you need. The risk of moving fluid into your hand with a sleeve like that is actually pretty high. Trusting to your wrist bones to provide clearance for lymph flow seems iffy at best--in the course of an active day slippage will naturally happen, and at any rate the vessels are just below the skin, cranky and very easily offended! I know that because that was exactly what happened to me: I had a bit of truncal swelling, and my first therapist ordered me a too-sturdy sleeve and no hand protection. Wasn't long until my whole hand and arm were involved as well, the fluid trapped by a hefty sleeve and no hand coverage. Usually for risk reduction purposes the lowest compression possible is desirable (that's be 15-20mm/hg). Here's an article by a reliable lymphology doctor about why hand protection is necessary when wearing a sleeve: http://www.lymphedivas.com/handprotection.asp And here's information about how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you, in case you'd like to seek out a second opinion: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm I'm personally awfully glad you're here and willing to share your experience with melanoma. Thank you! I'm anxious to bring more awareness to the fact that it's not just breast cancer treatment that can result in LE. The gynecologic cancers, prostate cancer, head and neck--it's a risk whenever nodes are removed or blocked with scar tissue, and it goes undiagnosed way too often. Brava to you for being on top of this! Be well! Binney",

But let me just pass along a suggestion that you get some help with this anyway. A couple of possibilities come to mind. First, that cellulitis sometimes \"percolates\" for a few days or weeks before sort of exploding on the scene. And second, that lymphedema is an inflammatory condition that way too often first appears (even years after treatment) as reddened inflammation of the breast. The way to assess that would be to check in with one of your doctors and get a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist. Breast lymphedema is treatable with a gentle massage technique called Manual Lymph Drainage that you can be taught to do yourself. Without treatment, though, it can lead to hardening of the tissue (fibrosis), skin changes, and an increased risk of serious systemic infection. Information about finding a qualified lymphedema therapist near you is here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Your call, of course.

It's a great thing, and sturdy enough to last a long time. But with a stocking with the toe in it there's no way to pull an Easy Slide out, so it doesn't work for that. Another good donner is the Ezy-AZ, which can be used for either sleeves or stockings: http://www.ezyasabc.com/product-info.html Gma, I don't use a donner for my stockings, but the Ezy-AZ would be a good option if you need it. The problem with stockings is the heel. I don my Allegros by sitting down securely and then gathering the stocking (using both hands) clear down to near the heel. Then I point my toes and put them all the way into the toe of the stocking (at this point the heel will be bunched up under the arch of the foot). Then, still holding the gathers, I move my fingers down under my foot and start to tug the heel into place. After fuming for a few moments I can finally feel it slip toward the heel. I just keep on tugging until it rounds the heel, then bend my foot up at the ankle to pull the rest of the stocking up into place. I don't know what compression level you got, but I got the 15-20 mm/hg, and it wasn't enough, so I started wearing them double, one over another. Any time you double a compression garment it doesn't create 2 times the compression, but only about one-and-a-half times. So two 15-20s actually equals somewhere around a 20-30. Getting a 15-20 on, even one over the other, is much easier than getting a 20-30 on. And a 20-30 is easier to get on than a 30-40, and so on. So maybe, if you continue to have a rough time with it, doubling up on a lower compression would make it easier. BrightLife allows you to try these things out and then return them if they don't work. Nice! Hope that wasn't too confusing! Hugs, Binney",

Writing by hand on paper also makes my hand swell, so I gave up sending out Christmas cards because I couldn't write notes in them or address them anymore. I did practice writing left-handed for awhile, but that's really hard to do! Other LE triggers can include changing weather (air pressure), plane travel, car trips especially with altitude change, some foods, and weight gain. Also repetitive activities, like possibly knitting or crocheting or cutting with a scissors (I use a rotary cutter for fabric). Some sports (depends on the person and also on their fitness level). And leaning weight on your arm, like standing next to a desk with your hands on the desk, leaning on an arm when scrubbing floors, certain yoga poses, and sitting on the floor with your knees up to your chest and your arms wrapped around them. Also, sleeping on your arm. If necessary, an OT trained in LE therapy may be able to help you make accommodations if some of those are favorite (or just necessary) activities. Worth asking, if they're important to you. If you've learned how to wrap your arm, that's the quickest way to reduce a flare. If you haven't learned, insist on being taught, because it gives you the freedom to get on with your life. Gentle hugs, Binney",

But fortunately there's lots that can be done, and lots of \"swell\" women here to help you! We all feel the frustration of the lack of information, as well as the poor lymphedema (LE) training that our medical professionals receive. Like the bc sisters who went before us and put bc on the map, we're trying to make LE awareness happen in order to protect those who come after us. So welcome to the front lines! First off, the woman with the dislocated arm CAN be helped. It's never too late, though catching LE early makes treatment both easier and more effective. If you have any way of connecting to this poor Sister, do carry a message of hope to her. A well-qualified LE therapist can definitely help, but she'll have to insist on a referral, which may require finding atherapist herself. Here's a site for finding well-trained LE therapists: www.mylymphedema.com You mention a finger stick, but do you know that blood draws from your foot are possible? Nobody nurse or phlebotomist wants to be bothered with doing that, so again, it may take some insistence and determination. LE bracelets are available from both the National Lymphedema Network and the American Cancer Society's online tlc catalog. You can find the National Lymphedema Network at www.lymphnet.org . While you're there, check out their position papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, Therapist Training, Therapy, and Exercise. Copy them off for your doctors, too -- can't hurt! There are also neon-pink hospital-type ID bracelets that you can wear for any procedures or surgeries, but they're harder to get because they're free and the site can be slow. They're at the Penninsula Medical site, I believe. If you don't get one in a reasonable time, go back and e-mail them. (Many here don't like IDs to say lymphedema on them, because our medical professionals don't take that seriously, so the Cancer Society bands just list the restrictions without the diagnosis.) txgrl, welcome to you too, and thanks for your suggestion -- you're right, the available IDs are not wildly fashionable! Good solution! As far as being proactive, best thing you both can do for yourself is to get a referral to a WELL-TRAINED LE therapist for baseline arm measurments and help with LE prevention tips and travel tips. Perhaps they'll teach you LE massage as well, which can help prevent problems. Be well! and keep us posted, Binney ",

      "Content": "Nov 10, 2011 03:54PM Binney4 wrote: Whew! Good questions -- huge subject! Flexi IS an improvement over older machines, because it does a more thorough job of imitating a MLD massage. It still requires that you clear your nodes yourself each time before using it (and after is a good idea too). The problem with earlier machines (and possibly with this if you don't do the node clearing) is that they wrung the fluid out of the arm rather than stimulating the lymph vessels in the way MLD does. If the nodes are not first cleared to receive the lymph fluid it will sit around in the area of the axilla and shoulder instead of being processed, and will eventually result in either pushing fluid into the trunk or creating a band of fibrotic tissue at the top of the arm (or both).The Flexi has less of a wringing action than earlier machines, more flowing over the skin in imitation of MLD. It's time consuming, and you have to lie flat so it's not real easy to watch TV or read while using it. Devoting an hour a day to it is a committment, and it's hard to think realistically about how you're going to fit it in to your day before you actually get it and start using it. It has a \"pause\" function so you can stop it if something comes up that's important, but it's a major bother to do that and then get back into position. There are dozens of \"better\" things to do with your time, so many people don't continue to use it once they get it. In fact, though self-MLD is time consuming too, it doesn't generally take me a whole hour to do it, and you can do it anywhere you want. MLD done by a trained therapist gives them the opportunity to feel what's going on under your skin, note any problems that may be developing, and correct any issues before they become a problem. Therapists can also develop an MLD routine that is personalized based on your own assortment of scars and missing nodes. Even self-MLD gives you the chance to note any changes or problems that may be developing. The pump won't give you any such feedback, so it's no substitute for hands-on therapy by a good therapist. Because I have bilateral LE I need two sets of garments for my Flexi, and I have to alternate days. I do find that, though the general direction of the Flexi action is downward toward the groin, there is some movement across the chest as well. With bilateral LE that is not acceptable, so I have to modify the way the chest garment fits to avoid it moving in that direction. So much for the cons. On the positive side, it makes self-MLD possible for women who have range of motion problems, a disability in one arm (such as arthritis, carpal tunnel or rotator cuff injuries), and for people with bilateral LE who just can't do that much manual work on themselves. For me, it's a big help with flares, when the amount of MLD I'm able to do is limited. It also reaches the back in ways I can't do myself. Technically, it's a tool some people use when other self-care measures don't work. And besides all that, when it's all properly adjusted it feels good! Once you have the garments adjusted you don't have to take them apart all the time. I used a permanent marker to mark where the velcro should go for those pieces I have to undo to get out of it, but the arm stays on the jacket and doesn't need readjustment every time. There is, BTW, a short strap you can order that has velcro on both ends and can be attached over the shoulder if you find the jacket part isn't tight enough at the shoulder (a common problem). You can buy it, but if you need it I'd suggest asking the trainer or area rep to comp you one, as it's part of a proper fit and shouldn't be an extra charge. The Flexi reps are unusually well-trained and generally extremely helpful. In my experience the trainers who come to help you set up may not be as knowledgeable as the reps, so if you have a problem after set-up, call the rep. This is a pricey machine, so take advantage of the expertise that's available to get the best use from it. It should not hurt, bind, or create new swelling. Examine your arm and trunk after use and don't get complacent about monitoring your progress. See your therapist at regular intervals for re-measurement and a hands-on evaluation of how it's working for you. There are other women here who use a Flexi, and I'm sure they'll be along (if they haven't already posted while I've been composing this novel!) Hope this helps. Let us know how it goes! Binney",

The entire affected quadrant of your body is at risk for lymphedema (think, chicken wing quarter -- back, side, arm, and hand above the waist on the operated and/or radiated side). If your surgery was bilateral, so is your risk. No deep massage at all should be done on that quadrant. Sadly, the risk remains for life. And while having a single node removed is relatively less risky than having ALND that removes dozens of them, if you develop lymphedema the risk is 100%. There are many women here at bc.org (myself included) who have developed lymphedema with a single node removed or with a prophylactic mastectomy with no nodes purposely removed. Risk reduction information available at these two sites: http://www.lymphnet.org  (See their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise -- along the right-hand side of the page) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Hope that helps!

Do you know how to wrap your hand with gauze and short-stretch? That'd be the most effective for the LE, and the most flexible arrangement for the taped fingers. If you don't know, now would be a great time to learn. Very handy skill. Short of that, do you have an old glove you can experiment with? A product called Fray-Chek that you can buy at fabric or craft stores would probably prevent fraying if you decided to cut them, but none of that is going to do anything for the look of the glove, that's for sure!

One of the things that helped me in the beginning was the book by Burt and White called, \"Lymphedema, A Breast Cancer Patient's Guide to Prevention and Healing.\" It deals with the emotional aspects, and it helped me to know that others were having the same huge problems I was. (It's especially hard because our medical teams tends to blow it off as an \"inconvenience,\" when in fact it's much more than that.) I found a copy at my library, then ordered my own from the bookstore. Have you found a therapist who's teaching you to do your own massage and wrapping? When you master those skills (it's a steep learning curve, but it's doable!) you'll have a lot more control over your own life again. Yes, it's for life, but it doesn't need to take YOUR life away. Of course you'll need to pick up your darlin' three-year-old. Use both arms and keep them close to your body, not extending them out away from you. If your therapist is also a PT she should be able to help you with \"body mechanics\" that will allow you to do all the things you need to do. As for your job, we do have another gal here who's gone on with her work as a hairdresser even with lymphedema (LE). She has to be extra careful to watch for infection, and you too will figure out what compromises you can make in order to get on with life. Please don't be afraid, parot. It truly does get easier.

You need the help of a well-qualified lymphedema (LE ) therapist. Since the requirements for this type of therapy are not yet state-mandated anywhere in the U.S. (we're working on that!) you need to know that the minimum requirements for therapist education are at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond their PT or OT certification, and at least a year's supervised experience treating LE. Ask before you go. For breast or chest LE (which is actually called truncal LE), also ask about the therapist's experience with truncal LE, as some work mainly with arm or leg LE. Here's a website for finding a fully qualified therapist in your area: www.mylymphedema.com Click on the Therapist Locator and follow each link to find all that are available. For more information about LE (including Position Papers on Treatment, Therapist Training, and several other important topics) go to the National Lymphedema Network website at: www.lymphnet.org (Copy off a few pages for your doctor too!) Here's what you can expect from therapy: s(he) will evaluate your medical background, do a physical exam, and measure both arms as well, to determine if it is LE and if so, the extent and staging of it. She will begin therapy that includes a gentle (wonderful!) massage to move the fluid out of your breast, instruction in skin care, exercises to do at home, and possibly suggestions for gentle compression for your chest area. With on-going therapy (from a few visits to a few weeks of daily visits) she will reduce both the swelling and the pain, and teach you to do the massage correctly yourself. When therapy is complete you should be able to control the swelling yourself, possibly with the help of bras, vests or camis that apply compression throughout the day and/or night. The therapy will also reduce (but not eliminate entirely) the danger of infection that comes with LE (due to the accumulation of stagnant lymph fluid, which is an excellent breeding ground for bacteria). If your breast is hard, therapy will return the softness to it as well. There are many of us on the Lymphedema board here who have chest or breast LE, some due to surgery alone and others from radiation or a combination of the two. Caring for ourselves properly helps to keep the LE from progressing. Robin Jane, breast LE (unlike arm LE) is often painful, and the pain does not respond to the usual pain meds, probably because it results from internal pressure on nerves. Therapy reduces the swelling, hardness, and pain, so seek help soon. Whether it is caused by surgery or rads is a difficult question, because the actual site of swelling or pain in your breast may not be the site where the damage occurred. Certainly arm LE is not caused by damage to the arm, but to the areas above it that have been compromised by surgery and/or rads. My own experience with chest LE is that the pain tends to move around, depending on which nerves are affected at the moment by the internal fluid accumulation. For some friendly comfort and advice, do drop in to the Lymphedema board, where you'll find you're not alone with this. Prayers and lots of gentle hugs to you both as you seek out the right treatment for YOU! Binney",

The whole issue is ignorance, and we can help with that. I never go in for any procedure without material to give to the staff about LE, and I tell them, \"Here's the latest on LE management--I knew you'd want to know about it.\" They DO want to know.

I read your bio as well and must say your story has been a dramatic one! Brava for you! I'm thinking you might want to consider asking for a referral from any doctor on your team to a well-trained lymphedema PT. S/he can help in lots of ways, but especially in evaluating your new chest discomfort and guiding you safely toward strenghtening your arms and shoulders. You may not be aware that chest lymphedema is possible without any swelling in your arms at all (it is actually called truncal lymphedema). It would definitely be exacerbated by weight-bearing exercises that are not started gradually and increased very slowly, and by weather changes as well. Feelings of tightness and pulling are possible signs of it. In many cases pain can be intense and difficult to control. Here's more information about it: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/breast_chest_trunckal_lymphedema.htm Here's how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm Doctors can be slow to recognize or diagnose truncal lymphedema, so it pays to check it out with a therapist. Call and talk to any you might be thinking of seeing, and ask about their experience with truncal lymphedema and their willingness to work with you on strength training. Again, welcome -- hoping you'll find information, encouragement and caring here is vast amounts! Be well, Binney",

Lots of doctors fail to mention these things, mostly because they don't see it as part of their specialty and so haven't learned much about it. The good news: MOST of us bc veterans will never develop lymphedema (current reliable estimates range somewhere around 30-40% over our entire lifetime) AND if you do develop it, there's treatment available -- and it's not invasive! Whew! There's lots you can do to reduce your risk of lymphedema -- here are two good web sites where you can learn about it: http://www.LymphNet.org   (see their Position Papers on Risk Reduction, Air Travel, and Exercise) http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_lymphedema.htm Lymphedema is not worth being afraid of, but it is worth learning about, because simple risk reduction practices may help you avoid it, and early detection and treatment can make it much simpler to treat and manage.

WHEW! Lymphedema is caused by our surgery and/or rads, because those procedures damage lymph nodes and vessels, and create blockages to lymph flow. When the lymph can't flow properly out of the tissues of our arms, breasts or chests, that's lymphedema. It causes swelling as the tissue builds up in those places, but before we see any swelling there can be as much as 30% more fluid in the tissues than is normal (which is a condition called \"pre-clinical lymphedema\" or \"Stage 0 lymphedema). Less than half of all women treated for breast cancer ever develop measurable lymphedema, so that's the good news. The link between cellulitis and lymphedema is complicated. In an area of the body already at risk for lymphedema, cellulitis can create more scar tissue (blocking the lymph flow further) and in that way may trigger lymphedema (or make it worse). Or it very well might not -- and hopefully that what you'll experience. The relationship goes the other way, too. Women with lymphedema are more likely to develop cellulitis, because the stagnant lymph fluid in their tissues is warm and protein rich, which is just what bacteria need to thrive and multiply. A woman with undiagnosed Stage 0 lymphedema is at risk for cellulitis for the same reason, even though she doesn't know it. So when someone who is at risk for lymphedema develops cellulitis, it's a good idea to get a referral to a well-trained lymphedema therapist for evaluation once the infection is cleared up. The therapist can help you understand if your cellulitis is related to undiagnosed lymphedema, and if so, can begin therapy to move the stagnant fluid out of there -- which reduces your chance of ever having to deal with the stupid cellulitis again. Here's how to find a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm For now, though, rest up, elevate your arm as much as possible, and stay really well hydrated.

Your reference to a \"smidge\" of lymphedema reminded me of that old saw about being \"a little bit pregnant\"! Lymphedema is a progressive disease, which often starts out as a come-and-go thing. (Usually when it's playing that game it disappears the minute you get in to show it to your doctor!) At any rate, that's an early warning sign, and treating it effectively at this very early stage can stop (or at least delay) progression. The trouble with lymphedema progression is that it's so invisible in the beginning stages. Swelling is only one sign, the only obvious one. It's what's going on inside that is the problem. Untreated (or poorly treated) lymphedema silently alters the tissue, layering fibrotic tissue and abnormal adipose (fat) tissue under the skin, where it eventually becomes a permanent hardness. Over time it also creates changes in texture of the skin, and later the pores may leak caustic lymph fluid, causing open sores that are very hard to heal. Untreated lymphedema also greatly increases our risk of serious, systemic infection (cellulitis, usually). For some reason that I'll never understand, our doctors are barely aware of this, and they don't tell us anything about it or even act like it's anything but a minor inconvenience. It is, in fact, a serious, chronic medical condition that requires skill and care to manage properly, and it'd sure be decent of them to at least learn about it before they dismiss it (and us!)

There's no \"guarantee\" you'll get lymphedema from a tattoo on an at-risk arm, but certainly it's a risk. Partly for the usual reasons. First, that any time you create trauma to a part of your body, the response of the body is to send loads of lymph fluid to the area (which is why injured areas swell), and this can overwhelm an already-compromised system. (The reason for the lymph fluid flood is that the lymph system is part of your immune system--it's there to intercept any bacteria and to carry off wounded or damaged cells.) And second, anyone who has been treated for breast cancer is at risk for lymphedema, which can be present before any swelling is obvious (it's called Stage 0 lymphedema). That means there's stagnant lymph fluid in the area, and any skin break can introduce bacteria which will absolutely thrive in all that warm, protein-rich lymph fluid. In other words, infection risk is really high, and such an infection constitutes an emergency because it can spread and become systemic very quickly. But with a tattoo there's more to think about, even if I don't know exactly what it means. It's this: tattoos result in a bit of the pigment straying off into the tissues. These bits get picked up by the lymph system and carried to any remaining nodes, where they never leave, because the lymph nodes can't break them down. There's no evidence that's particularly harmful (and no evidence that it's not either), but it's something to think about with a compromised lymph system. And on the other hand, lots of women have gotten tattoos post breast cancer with apparently no adverse effects. One of the really rotten things about lymphedema is that it's so hard to get any hard-and-fast advice. So, definitely, your call! I'm so sorry about your Dad's passing. I trust you'll find a tribute to the love you have for him that is truly worry-free. Be well! Binney",

You're sure welcome to complain here, slforbes! I know what you mean -- \"it could be worse.\" But that doesn't make it easier, at least not for me. The lymphedema is humiliating, and it took me quite awhile to feel like going out. Those feelings of being freakish still sneak up on me sometimes, but it's not so constant anymore and I can go out most times without even thinking about it. That took time, though. I think it's a kind of grieving -- takes time and hard work, and we have to give ourselves room to be sad and angry, and then move on. Like you, I hit a wall of depression when the treatment was over and I was \"supposed to\" just be done with it all and move on. I think most of us face that. It's such a nasty surprise. Other people don't understand it too well either. They want us to be all better and not have to think about it anymore. But for us, it's the first real chance we've had to deal with all the emotional impact of the diagnosis and marathon treatment.

We have an old thread here called \"What do you want nurses to know about LE?\" that will at least let you know you're not alone in this. Good for you for advocating for yourself! At the National Lymphedema Network site, among the Position Papers, you'll find information for yourself and your doctors (copy it off for them!) on Air Travel. You'll also want to read the ones on Risk Reduction and Exercise, as they'll give you information you won't likely be getting from your healthcare team. Here's the web address: www.lymphnet.org If you wear a sleeve be sure to wear a glove as well (another thing you may not hear from the doctors), because otherwise any swelling can be trapped in your hand. And do try them out before your trip. They're not a treat to wear, but they shouldn't cause pain or be so tight at the wrist or top (or fingers) that they leave long-lasting marks when you take them off. Your fingertips should not be purple either! If you find them irritating between your fingers or at the elbow, try using a bit of cornstarch in those areas before putting the garments on.( I pour some in a cotton sock, rubber-band the top closed and use that to pat the cornstarch just where I need it. Saves a slippery mess on the bathroom floor.) If you research all this and decide you're not going to wear the garments, then you still might think about getting them anyway and taking them with you. That way if you develop problems flying you'll have them for the trip home. It's a real trick getting LE help in a strange town. Garments are also great for LE prevention when you're exercising or doing anything strenuous (scrubbing floors, moving boxes, etc.) If you wear them outside you need to know they will not protect from sunburn (even though it sure seems like they would!) In short, if you have a well-trained LE therapist (there's a Position Paper on Therapist Training also), you can trust her to know what your doctors and nurses don't. The therapists are the ones with the LE training. In the meantime it's up to us to help our doctors and nurses learn how to prevent and care for LE so the bc Sisters coming after us don't have such a confusing and frustrating time of it. Have a wonderful trip and let us know how it goes! Binney (back on the boards after giving in and buying a new computer--sigh!)",

Please share any and all suggestions you use for avoiding, treating, or dealing with flares.  I'll start it off by mentioning that when I flare I panic. The emotions I feel seem (even to me) to be out of all proportion to the swelling. One result of that is that when I then wrap my arm or do self-MLD, I overdo it. Wrap too tight and massage too hard to \"get that sucker back into shape.\" I have to slow way down, do something relaxing before trying to wrap or massage, and go back over everything in my mind to remind myself to take it easy. Nobody's mentioned this here for awhile, but if you clear your nodes well before stepping into the shower, then soap, dry, and lotion in the order and direction of your MLD massage, that gives you a bit of mini-massage without the hassle. Because I have LE in my back as well, and massage it downward to below my waist, I also let the shower do some of the massage by moving under it so the spray moves down my back. (Gives me a great excuse for standing in the shower extra-long too!)  When my swelling is in good control, I do some controlled experiments to see what I can get away with. How long can I stay outside in the humidity without getting \"that feeling\"? How many squares can I cut on my rag quilt? How long can I play my mandolin? (Nah, I don't have a mandolin -- wish I did!) I'll try things in 15-minute increments, increasing after a couple of days of that if it's still working okay. That way I'm moving towards a bit more freedom, but doing it carefully enough not to add several days of flaring to my frustrations. Okay, other thoughts, ladies? Thanks!

Completely crazy how long this has taken. Now they're finding that even our cancer tumors have a lymph supply, and that very possibly the depth of lymph penetration may be a predictor of recurrence or mets. As one of our lymphedema research heroes likes to say, in the last few years we've entered a Renaissance of Lymphedema Research. (More on the history of lymphedema here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/History_of_Lymphedema.htm ). Sure hope they get ON with it and find a way to fix us all!

      "Content": "Dec 7, 2007 06:11PM - edited Dec 7, 2007 06:12PM by Binney4 Hi, Jen, I had the same thing happen and requested the lab to redo their assessment. They went over everything again and still found no more nodes in the tissue. My onc, like yours, was not perturbed. He said everyone has a different number of nodes to start with, and that the absence of any other cancer in the remaining tissue was reassuring. If it puts your mind at ease, ask them to redo the labs -- they save the tissue and can request a second pathologist to do it. Only I'm going to add a word of caution here, in the hope it will spare you grief. I have since developed lymphedema, despite how few nodes were removed. But I have always wondered (and there's no research to support this either way) if the fact that I had so few lymph nodes to begin with is what put me at high risk for lymphedema. So I just wanted to suggest to you that you familiarize yourself with the simple lifestyle changes that can help you reduce your risk of lymphedema. You can find a Risk Reduction Position Paper at the National Lymphedema Network website here: www.lymphnet.org Best plan of all: ask your onc (or your surgeon, or your PCP) for a referral to a well-trained and experienced lymphedema therapist who can record baseline arm measurements, fit you for a sleeve and glove you can wear for travel and for any strenuous exercise, and give you plenty of hints for preventing lymphedema. Just a thought. That said, all of us who have been treated for breast cancer are at risk for lymphedema, and at present there's no way to accurately assess any one individual's actual risk. Bottom line is, lymphedema is treatable if you do develop it, so please be watchful but not anxious. It'll be good, Jen! Binney ",

Heat is a major risk for triggering lymphedema, so a sauna or other heat treatment would be something you'd want to think over carefully. Lymphedema is not only a health risk (because of the heightened possibility of serious systemic infection, skin conditions, inflammation, etc.), but it's also a life-long quality of life issue due to the disfigurement and distress, as well as possible disability.

One of the researchers who presented a paper at the NLN conference talked at some length about how women with LE are so fearful of new swelling, and she was baffled by the fact that we never seem to get over that fear, even when we've experienced it many times and gotten it back under control. I was baffled that she was baffled! Which is why I'm so glad we have each other, because WE sure get it! Everybody's different, of course, but for me the change of activity level would definitely be the entire explanation. If I skip a day of exercise my LE let's me know about it. After 2.5 weeks I'd be a mess. You could try getting more exercise throughout the day even if it only involves your arms. The Lebed DVD ( www.lebedmethod.com ) can be done sitting, if necessary, and it would certainly provide you with a good, gentle return to activity, as well as a bit of lymphatic stimulation. Drink plenty, steer away from salt, do some deep breathing, and try to keep your nodes cleared from time to time throughout the day. Bummer! Wishing you quick improvement, Binney",

Here's a new study by Nicole Gergich (and others) that was presented at the recent National Lymphedema Network conference and caused a lot of excitement. It gives us hope that early intervention in subclinical LE (no visible or measurable swelling yet) can halt progression and further tissue damage, and possibly make the full Therapy Intensive unnecessary. The devise they're using in this study measures fluid volume in the arm before it can be detected any other way, so that technology is really revolutionizing diagnosis and early LE treatment, but compliance depends pretty much on the women listening to their \"talking\" arms .

Naturally other things happen to our arms, even though we have lymphedema there, and we have to take care of those things in spite of the lymphedema. In fact, if whatever is wrong with our arms is causing pain, then taking care of that is important because the constant pain makes the lymphedema worse (our bodies send extra lymph fluid out to any part of us that hurts -- not a good thing for our arms!) So surgery on a LE arm is possible, and with some extra care you can come out of this just fine.  You'll want your swelling to be as reduced as possible in both your arm and your chest before surgery, which may mean some extra days with the therapist for thorough massage for several days prior. Perhaps your therapist will be willing to work with the surgeon on precautions and procedures that will do the least amount of damage. Extra antibiotic protection starting a few days before the procedure can help prevent infection, which is both more likely and more damaging to tissues when LE is present. Afterward, wrapping as soon as medically possible (or other compression as agreed upon by your therapist and doctor) will help prevent excessive swelling. It may take a bit longer to heal and to reduce the swelling after surgical trauma, but with a good plan and some self-care (and hopefully good therapist attention too) you'll be able to weather it. I hope that helps some. Also, sent you a private message. Well, and prayers, too, for successful surgery and quick, painfree healing. Binney",

I sure wouldn't jump to any unpleasant conclusions about this kicking off lymphedema. Not today's problem, at any rate. That said, yes, in fact an injury like that can precipitate lymphedema, but it can also just cause some temporary swelling because, doggone, you hurt it! There are some things you can do now to help assure that lymphedema doesn't happen, though. Keep your injured arm elevated as much as possible, on the back of the couch when you're watching TV, on pillows at night. Drink PLENTY of water (helps dilute the lymph fluid and make it flow more easily). DON'T use hot packs to ease the discomfort, as heat draws more lymph to the site so more swelling is likely, and with a compromised lymph system that's a poor idea. Warm is okay, but NO temperature extremes (if you use an ice pack, pad the area well first so it doesn't get too cold, and don't leave it on more than 15 minutes at a time). Don't wrap it with an ACE bandage as you could block lymph flow (the lymph vessels are directly under the skin, and compromised ones do not take kindly to being squashed). Watch for sudden new swelling, increase in pain, redness, heat to the touch, itching or fever, and get to your doc, ER or critical care at once if you notice any such symptoms. If you should have that problem be sure to remind whoever's treating you that the arm is at risk for lymphedema, and therefore for infection as well. Believe it or not, deep abdominal breathing also helps to move lymph fluid throughout the body, so do it frequently throughout the day: in through your nose, expanding your belly, then out slowly through your mouth. Like blowing soap bubbles. In other words, sit down with your arm up, sip something soothing and caffeine free, relax, take deep satisfying breaths and...did I mention chocolate? Hmmm. No, huh? Let us know what you discover, Dawn. More lymphedema risk reduction tips at the National Lymphedema Network web site: www.lymphnet.org. Be well, Binney ",

You might want to have the fit checked by either an experienced fitter or a well-qualified lymphedema therapist. An evaluation by a therapist would also give you baseline clinical arm measurements for future reference, personalized risk-reduction tips, and instruction in a gentle lymphatic massage you can use prophylactically.  You need hand protection whenever you wear a sleeve, either a gauntlet (fingerless glove) or a glove. Again, the fit needs to be right, so have it checked out by someone who really knows this stuff. And check out this page on garment fitting too: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/proper_fitting_of_lymphedema_garments.htm For travel, stay well hydrated, keep your arm gently exercised, do some periodic deep abdominal breathing, and let somebody else heft those heavy bags.

Standing up it eases downward, but lying down it has the same \"spread\" as a real breast. The shape is full, too. I'm not in the market for a swim prosthesis, but if I was I'd certainly consider that. She mentioned it was also good for runners, and I could see that too. I think it \"breathes\" really well, so should be excellent for sports. Off subject somewhat, but she also showed me the Trulife Impressions, which anchors itself well to your skin. It's not a swim form, it's a regular-wear form, but you don't need a pocket bra because it -- I don't know, it just doesn't budge once you put it in place. She said when she was helping one woman try one on she tried to reach in and move it into a slightly different position and it simply wasn't going anywhere. But it doesn't stick to the skin in the sense of adhesive--it's just the way it's made that makes it budge-proof. Interesting! Great to see innovations like these. I'd love to hear from anyone who's tried either. Be well! Binney",

So for safety's sake please don't even wait for morning, but go to the ER for help tonight. Avoiding serious infection spread is one of the best ways to avoid developing lymphedema. Having said that, though, I know you're likely thinking it can wait, and you don't want to sit around the ER at this hour (or any hour, for that matter). So if you decide not to go, at least take a permanent marker and draw a line around the reddened or pink area so by morning you'll have an exact idea of whether it's spreading or not.

Especially at Stage 0, in fact, because that's when you can most easily head off progression and infection and make everything easier to handle moving forward. If you don't have one, here's information about how to find one near you (any doctor on your team can write you a referral for an evaluation): http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm If you already know how to do MLD, that alone might give you some freedom from wearing compression garments all the time. But the determining factors about when to wear them have to do with how your arm feels (tingling, achiness, heaviness, just feeling \"funny\"), what activities you're doing (travel, exercise, any unusual activity), and possibly other factors like a salty meal or an approaching storm. Sadly, those things can happen whether you're wearing long sleeves or short ones, so that's not really a factor. Wish it was! <sigh!> Be well! Binney",

NALEA member schools are committed to teaching the most up-to-date knowledge and evidence-based practice to therapists seeking lymphedema certification. NALEA member schools are devoted to fostering high-quality communication among lymphedema therapists and to supporting certified lymphedema therapists with continuing education opportunities.   NALEA functions to: Disseminate information regarding training standards to medical professionals, lymphedema patients, certified lymphedema therapists, and prospective students. Inform certified therapists of important developments and current research in the field of lymphedema management. Monitor the content, scope, and delivery models of its member schools' curricula. Maintain qualifications and standards for lymphedema instructors of member schools. Uphold and strengthen the skills and knowledge base of trained therapists via recertification programs. Provide an endorsement of quality to member schools by issuing the NALEA logo for posting on member websites and other informational materials. Considering the long history of animosity (or at least snootiness) between training schools, this is practically an historic moment! Here's to all of them for joining hands to reach goals we patients could never achieve alone! Then again, we patients sure will be watching their progress and holding them to all their good intentions. Teamwork! Onward! Binney Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Binney4 wrote: Just received this notice from Bob Weiss, the insurance advocate for the National Lymphedema Network, advising those on Medicare of how to successfully appeal for payment for compression garments (and bandages). I believe it's still necessary to pay up-front, but the process he describes here is working well for reimbursement. If you need help understanding or following through, contact Bob by email at LymphActivist (at) aol (dot) com. Bob's been tireless in working to get payment for garments--THANKS, BOB! The following guidance is given to Medicare Suppliers regarding the coverability of medical items as SURGICAL DRESSING Medicare benefits. Authority for the following is Section 100 of Chapter 15 of the Medicare Benefit Coverage Manual which covers Surgical Dressings as authorized by the Social Security Act Section 1861(s)(5). This guidance applies to medical items used in the dressing of debridable wounds. The medical necessity requirements are contained in local coverage determinations (LCDs) and their billing details in accompanying coverage policy articles.  The coverage requirements described below are, in this layman's opinion, derived from coverage criteria applicable to items used in the treatment of open wounds, and are not applicable to members of other benefit categories like durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics or prosthetic devices, all of which have their individual coverage criteria unique to their medical use or function. It is therefore erroneous to deny coverage to an item before determining in which benefit category it may belong based on its medical function. And yet this is exactly what is done when a lymphedema compression bandage system, a lymphedema compression garment or a lymphedema device is denied because it does not meet the coverage criteria required for a surgical dressing. I strongly recommend that every Medicare denial of a lymphedema bandage system, compression garment or device be appealed because they can be shown to \"replace all or part of ... the function of a permanently inoperative or malfunctioning internal body organ\" and \"are covered when furnished on a physician\u2019s order.\" [Section 120, Chapter 15 of the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, CMS Publication 100-02.] and therefore meet the coverage criteria for a PROSTHETIC DEVICE. November 09, 2012 Surgical Dressings - Benefit Category Reminder Recently questions have arisen regarding the use of surgical dressings for Medicare beneficiaries. Surgical dressings are afforded limited coverage by Medicare as defined in the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Benefit Policy Manual (Internet-only Manual, Publ. 100-2). Chapter 15, Section 100 of the Benefit Policy Manual provides details for coverage of surgical dressings under this benefit: Surgical dressings are limited to primary and secondary dressings required for the treatment of a wound caused by, or treated by, a surgical procedure that has been performed by a physician or other health care professional to the extent permissible under State law. In addition, surgical dressings required after debridement of a wound are also covered, irrespective of the type of debridement, as long as the debridement was reasonable and necessary and was performed by a health care professional acting within the scope of his/her legal authority when performing this function. Surgical dressings are covered for as long as they are medically necessary. Primary dressings are therapeutic or protective coverings applied directly to wounds or lesions either on the skin or caused by an opening to the skin. Secondary dressing materials that serve a therapeutic or protective function and that are needed to secure a primary dressing are also covered. Items such as adhesive tape, roll gauze, bandages, and disposable compression material are examples of secondary dressings. Elastic stockings, support hose, foot coverings, leotards, knee supports, surgical leggings, gauntlets, and pressure garments for the arms and hands are examples of items that are not ordinarily covered as surgical dressings. Some items, such as transparent film, may be used as a primary or secondary dressing. As a result of this restrictive language, not all wounds are eligible for surgical dressing reimbursement. To be eligible for coverage, at least one of the two following key statutory requirements must be met: The wound must be surgically-created or surgically-modified; or, The wound requires debridement. The DME MAC Surgical Dressings Local Coverage Determination and related Policy Article provides additional examples of situations (not all-inclusive) in which dressings are statutorily excluded from coverage under the Surgical Dressings benefit: Drainage from a cutaneous fistula which has not been caused by or treated by a surgical procedure; or, A Stage I pressure ulcer; or, First degree burn; or, Wounds caused by trauma which do not require surgical closure or debridement - e.g., skin tear or abrasion; or, A venipuncture or arterial puncture site (e.g., blood sample) other than the site of an indwelling catheter or needle. There must be sufficient information in the beneficiary's medical record regarding the wound(s) (e.g., etiology, size, depth, tunneling/undermining, exudate/escar characteristics, prior treatments) to allow the DME MAC's review staff to determine that the wound(s) meet the applicable statutory coverage criteria. In some instances, it may be clinically appropriate to utilize a particular dressing to treat a wound; however, unless the statutory benefit category requirements for surgical dressings described above are met, Medicare coverage for the surgical dressing is precluded. Claims for surgical dressings that do not meet the statutory benefit requirements will be denied as non-covered (no benefit). Note that if the above statutorily-excluded dressings are billed to Medicare, they must have appended a GY modifier, indicating no Medicare benefit. This statutory exclusion and need for a GY modifier also applies to dressings used for similar situations such as abrasions, cuts, friction tears, ruptured bullae, self-inflicted wounds, \"moisture-acquired skin defects\" and similar wounds unless they are either (a) caused by or the result of a surgery or (b) documented in the record to have requiredsurgical debridement. Gradient compression stockings merit additional caution. According to CMS, gradient compression stockings that serve a therapeutic or protective function and that are needed to secure a primary dressing may be covered as surgical dressings. The gradient stocking must be proven to deliver compression greater than 30 mm Hg. and less than 50 mm Hg. In addition to these requirements, the basic benefit category requirement of use to treat a surgically-created or surgically-treated wound must still be met. Consequently, Medicare limits the coverage and reimbursement of gradient compression stockings to the following situation: The beneficiary must have an open venous stasis ulcer that has been treated by a physician or other healthcare professional requiring medically necessary debridement. [Emphasis added] Additionally, CMS provides guidance on situations where gradient compression stockings are non-covered: Venous insufficiency without stasis ulcers Prevention of stasis ulcers Prevention of the reoccurrence of stasis ulcers that have healed Treatment of lymphedema in the absence of ulcers When a covered gradient compression stocking is provided to a patient with an open venous stasis ulcer, the modifier AW (item furnished in conjunction with a surgical dressing) must be appended or the claim will be denied as a non-covered service. Finally, note that many of the citations above reference documentation of treatment by the physician or other healthcare professional. Suppliers are reminded that the CMS Program Integrity Manual(Internet-only Manual, Chapter 5) in Section 5.7 states (in part): However, neither a physician's order nor a CMN nor a DIF nor a supplier prepared statement nor a physician attestation by itself provides sufficient documentation of medical necessity, even though it is signed by the treating physician or supplier. There must be information in the patient's medical record that supports the medical necessity for the item and substantiates the answers on the CMN (if applicable) or DIF (if applicable) or information on a supplier prepared statement or physician attestation (if applicable). Suppliers should refer to the Surgical Dressings LCD and related Policy Article for additional coverage, coding and documentation requirements. The above are the opinions of a lymphedema patient advocate, advising lymphedema patients of their statutory right to appeal Medicare decisions with which they disagree. The above is not to be interpreted as legal, medical or billing advice, but are the opinions of a non-professional layman. These opinions have been confirmed by over a dozen Administrative Law Judges in over 20 individual cases, where Medicare Contractor denials have been reversed for lymphedema treatment materials.

And on the other hand sitting around for an hour waiting to shower is not gonna work. Best bet is probably to clear the nodes in your neck before you shower, then wash and dry in the direction and order of your MLD routine so you move fluid toward the cleared nodes. Use some lotion before donning compression again (applying the lotion in the same order and direction). Let us know how it goes! 11bc, aerobic and weight-bearing exercises are a two-edged sword where lymphedema is concerned. They help because muscle movement is an important part of the lymph pumping system. They are also a hazard because they increase fluid flow in the body and can cause accelerated fluid build-up in the tissues. Each of us is different in the amount of such exercise our compromised lymph systems can handle. Dr. K. Schmitz, whose weight-lifting studies often inspire misdirected enthusiasm over the effects of exercise on lymphedema, emphasizes that consistency and very gradual build-up to exercise are paramount -- week-end warriors are more likely than others to suffer unwanted consequences from their endeavors. All of us who have LE or at risk for it certainly need to be extra-aware of our bodies and stop at the first sign of difficulty, no matter what exercise program has been devised for us. Hard to do sometimes! Be well! Binney",

Redness following cellulitis infection, though is fairly common. Since Bob Wiess (the \"Lymphactivist\" who always helps with LE Medicare appeals) gave me permission to post anything helpful he said on the LE Advocates board, I'll just quote him on this one: \"...in many, many cases what starts out as a bacterial infection of the skin (cellulitis) also involves the autoimmune response of the lymphatic system to the perceived invasion. After the actual bacterial threat is diminished or eliminated by a course of antibiotics, the inflammatory response can persist for weeks. It is this inflammatory response that continues the redness and swelling after the infection is no more. If the immediately affected areas are too tender to be treated, there may be benefit to treating the more proximal lymphatics, stimulating the entire lymphatic system and creating a 'negative pressure' which would encourage drainage of the more distal areas.\" Hope that helps.

I wish it were that simple! Truncal lymphedema (on the chest, back, side or axilla) can develop with NO involvement of the arm or hand. And arm/hand lymphedema can start in any part of the arm or hand. One common place is just below the elbow. Another is in the upper arm. It can involve the entire arm or just the hand, or even just a small area of one of the other. For instance, swelling just at the bottom of the thumb, or only in the middle of the back of the hand. Any new or unresolved swelling should be followed closely, preferably with the help of an evaluation by a well-qualified lymphedema therapist--they're the medical professionals who have been trained to deal with lymphedema. Any doctor on your team can make the referral. Denise, if ice helps the swelling that's a good thing, but do make sure there's a good barrier between the ice and your skin, and limit icing to 15 minutes or less at a time. With lymphedema, extremes of temperature (either hot or cold) can lead to rebound swelling. Lili, there are no dumb lymphedema questions, but it sure can be hard finding the answers! Please ask away--we all need one another. Gentle hugs to all, Binney",

As Ravdeb says, even a gauntlet is better than no hand protection. But a glove is better yet, especially for lifting and other strenuous work. It may be true that LE most often shows up first in the arm, but that is not always the case, by any means. It can start with swelling in the hand or even in a finger or two. So your best protecion is a glove with that sleeve. Other lifting helps are: Work up it gradually (exercise at home is a good way to start). Stop AT ONCE if your arm or chest feels strained, achy, or sore; elevate it and give it a rest (Keep it elevated on a pillow overinght) -- you can try again the next day. Use both arms to lift rather than just your affected arm, and keep the weight close to your body (not supporting weight while your arm is extended away from your body. Avoid excess heat or overheating your body with exertion. Stay well hydrated, and protect your arm from any skin breaks or sunburn (use plenty of good lotion a couple of times a day to prevent microscopic dry-skin cracks). Break from time to time for a few deep, abdominal breaths (in through your nose, expand your tummy, out through your nose.) May you never have a \"swell\" day! Binney ",

Some small studies found it helpful in reducing swelling, others (one from Mayo) noted no efficacy, so it was never proven to help. There was an unacceptably high incidence of liver toxicity with Coumarin use, so if you decide to go that route you'd want to weigh the risk and make sure to monitor liver function carefully. I'm surprised they'd mention that in a 2011 discussion, since it's not currently considered an acceptable lymphedema treatment. Looking forward with you to quick, smooth sailing through rads.

This guy went to three doctors before he found one who had experience with the procedure and was really knowledgeable about it. Perhaps another version from another doctor would give you options you don't have at the moment, or at least confirm your direction. Another thought, since this is rare, is to ask the doc for the name of a patient willing to share their experience with you. Thinking of you and keeping you in my prayers.

Here's the web address of the National Lymphedema Network, where you can read their Position Papers about things like Therapy standards and Therapist Training, Air travel, Exercise and Reducing your risks: http://www.lymphnet.org You're right to be pressing for an evaluation by a well-trained lymphedema (LE) therapist. Do make sure before you go that she (or he) has at least 135 hours of specifically LE training beyond her PT or OT certification, and at least a year's supervised experience treating LE. The therapy will most likely be daily for several weeks, and it includes the special gentle LE massage, wrapping in short-stretch bandages to reduce swelling and keep it from re-swelling, skin care, exercises, and lots of instruction in learning to do all those things for yourself. After the swelling is well reduced she'll also help you get fitted for compression garments to keep it all in control. I just wanted to say that all of this is doable, even living alone, but there are moments when it won't feel  that way. It is frustrating to learn the massage and bandaging (but that's true even for those of us with family support. In fact, I'll confess right now to a few bandage-throwing fits myself, with DH and kids looking on in shock. ) Still, we BC veterans are Warrior Women with lots of past coping experience to draw on, so take heart - before you know it this part of your life will be back in your control!

Here are two sites: http://www.womanspersonalhealth.com/products/692/Anita-1094-Compression-Surgical-Bra.htm http://www.thepinkbra.com/anita1094.html Amazon has them for close to half the price of the other sites, but in a limited range of sizes: www.amazon.com/Anita-Compressi... And this site offers both the Anita and Wearease, but I'm not familiar with the site so don't know how they are to deal with: www.nextag.com/compression-bra... Why not ask your therapist to have the local medical supply place order one of each for you to try? I know Wearease let my fitter return the ones that didn't fit at no charge to her, and it's even possible your medical supplier already has an account with Anita since they make other mastectomy bras too, so no problem there. I've suggested several new products to my fitter (Wearease bras, Silique Comfort-Lite prostheses, Gottfried sleeves and gloves) and she's as pleased as can be to know about good products that are out there. So far all those companies have been willing to work with her. And she's been able to use them for her other customers too, so I feel like they're getting a wider selection as well. The way I figure is, even if my insurance is paying, these are pricey items, so I should be able to get what I want, not just the one brand a fitter may already be selling. (The exception to this seems to be the boutique-type places, which have real limits on what they're willing to stock.) But it's worth a try, anyway. Keep us posted! Binney",

Recent research indicates a rise in truncal lymphedema (swelling of the breast/chest, back or side) since the development of the SLN + rads procedure, probably because the sentinel node procedure targets the nodes that drain the breast area specifically, and the rads further damage the remaining nodes and lymph vessels. Lymphedema is nasty, but it's not even in the same class as a bc recurrence, so treating the bc aggressively should be our primary concern. But beyond that, it's well worth the effort to find out how best to lower our risk. Best of all is checking in with a well-trained lymphedema therapist to learn all you can about the simple life-style changes that can help protect you. vtEllen, that burning/tingling can certainly be neuropathy, but it can also be an early sign of lymphedema. Before any swelling is visible or measurable, there can be 30% more fluid in your tissues than is normal -- in other words, lymphedema is already present. It is called Stage 0 or pre-clinical lymphedema. Most times this results in feelings of tingling, aching, heaviness -- or just \"feeling funny.\" If lymphedema is treated at that stage recent studies show it does not progress. (Treatment at that stage is usually a couple of weeks of well-fitted compression garments, then using those garments only for exercise, travel, or any time those feelings return). Nobody told me I was at risk. I wish they'd given me the real facts, so I'd have had the chance to choose for myself what risks I was willing to take. Wishing you all a quick recovery and no \"swell\" days ever! Hugs, Binney",

I'm really sorry you're at this \"waiting\" stage -- it's gotta be the worst part of this journey. I'll be praying that your biopsy results are beautifully benign! Lymphedema following a biopsy, with no nodes purposely removed, is really not much of a worry. Still, if you want to be extra careful, you can follow the Risk Reduction guidelines from the National Lymphedema Network here: www.lymphnet.org.  They're simple and sensible, and they may give you a sense of protection after your procedure. As for chronic breast pain after a biopsy, that's gotta be really rare. Our doctors always have to tell us all the remote possibilities in an effort to protect themselves. And our job is to hear it, take whatever steps we can to reduce the risk, and then get on with our lives. So after your biopsy, do be careful to follow the after-care instructions that the doctor or nurse gives you, and do take your time and be good to yourself while you're recovering. But then put that part behind you and be ready to move beyond this difficult time and back into the swing of your life.  Let us know how it goes, Kim! (((((Hugs))))) and prayers, Binney ",

That sure is an interesting (and rather awful!) idea about how your lymphedema (LE) might have developed, but it's a new one to me. I hope you'll ask your therapist more about it and let us know what she says. Whatever actually initiated it, I'm glad you're getting the help you need to deal with it. Good for you! Here's why it seems strenge to me: our lymph system is divided into four parts, or \"watersheds,\" meaning there are four sort of separate lymph drainage areas in our body. The dividing lines between them around the waist, and straight down the center of us from neck to groin. In other words, sort of like chicken quarters. After bc treatment, the affected \"wing quarter\" is the area that's compromised. Below the waist should be fine (unless you also had tram-flap or diep recon surgery, in which case that \"leg quarter\" might also be at risk). So if you were injecting below your waist there shouldn't have been a problem - theoretically, at least. On the other hand, LE is unpredictable enough that - who knows? At any rate, I hope you're doing well with treatment and finding your way through the maze of self-care to great control. Let us know what you discover! Be well! Binney ",

I too was surprised to see the diuretic use and I wondered, if your therapist has not used bandaging or compression garments, what his/her treatment consists of? Therapists are rare in many areas, and sometimes they're so overwhelmed with a heavy patient load that they can't do all the treatment that's needed. I hope you'll be able to find someone thorough and really helpful! I know Bordeaux is a long way from Paris, but perhaps if you called the clinic there they'd be able to steer you to resources closer to home for you. One possible cause of LE that hasn't been mentioned here is that lymph blockage can be caused by mets. It's not uncommon, and several women who post on the Stage IV board have dealt with it. In some cases the swelling can't be readily reduced, but even then some support from wrapping or compression garments helps to ease any pain or discomfort. Many women use foam-filled night garments for that purpose because the softer form of compression is even more comfortable, in spite of being bulky. Leg swelling and discomfort may also be made worse when you've been treated with Taxol, which can cause both swelling and painful neuropathy. It's important for a LE therapist to take the time to assess the causes so she/he can treat it in the most appropriate way. So glad you've found us here, and hope you'll find the companionship of our \"swell\" sorority a boost! Do let us know what you discover! Gentle hugs, Binney",

If I were in your position and had access to a fully-trained lymphedema therapist, I'd see her before surgery for baseline measurements for future reference and ask her to teach me how to do self-Manual Lymph Drainage. Then I'd do it for several days before surgery and for at least a few weeks afterward to encourage healing and open new lymph pathways. Also, current wisdom says not to raise your arms above shoulder level for the first two weeks after surgery, to allow healing of the lymph vessels in the underarm area and avoid further damage to the delicate lymphatics (there's a brief period following any trauma or surgery during which our bodies attempt to repair the vessels that are damaged). Establishing a relationship with a qualified lymphedema therapist before surgery is, of course, ideal. Go for it! Wishing you smooth sailing through all that's ahead, and no \"swell\" days ever!

I think because of the tightness these would leave ridge-y things on anyone, LE or no. So the question really is, is there swelling there, or just plain old skin glad to be loose from the confines of these goofy garments? If it's only bumpy and not swollen (sore, irritated, heavy-feeling achy), then it's probably okay.

I think the amount of force you're talking about, Hugz, where it practically folds your skin over on itself, would be too much--MLD needs to be \"kitten-petting\" gentle.

Not so good to use for therapy, though, where the actual touch of a knowledgeable therapist is important for assessing the condition of both skin and underlying tissue. Really interesting.

But that's apparently open to interpretation, because they add, \"Some physicians will allow patients to resume compression after several days on antibiotics and if the infection is clearly going away.\" Hmmm! Probably best to ask your prescribing doctor. Itchiness is definitely part of this ugly cellulitis picture, and it can even be the first indication you have of infection.  IVs are definitely not always needed, but if I were camping or traveling and I suspected infection, I'd start popping the antibiotics according to the instructions and head for help, both. Depending where you might be traveling overseas (Germany, Austria, or Holland, say - maybe even Australia) you might actually be better off medically there than here, since the medical community in those countries is better informed about LE than ours is. Did you fly home with cellulitis? Aaaugh! How long a flight was it? Did you use compression to fly? Man, I bet that hurt! So glad you're feeling better.

If it's not LE that's causing the puffiness in your hand, I'd sure want to know what it is, as other causes of swelling need to be treated very promptly. If there aren't other causes for the puffiness, you might ask her why she thinks it's not LE. And, sure, do ask if she intends to do (and teach you to do) Manual Lymphatic Drainage massage. No lotion for that, as Inspie points out. Perhaps she's working on the scarring first and will then address your arm?

In the case of those of us who have had cancer, it's generally used to rule out new tumors (sorry if that's a harrowing thought ). It can be used, usually in conjunction with other imaging techniques like doppler and lymphoscintigraphy, and more recently with bioimpedence, to image hard-to-diagnose LE -- which usually means primary (congenital) LE that seems to arise from no obvious cause. It isn't usually used to diagnose post-bc LE because the probable cause already exists and a well-trained LE therapist can usually confirm the diagnosis with a simple clinical exam. (But of course a lot of doctors don't know that, just like they don't know that breast/chest LE is actually fairly common .) I'm really not sure whether an MRI alone would be able to supply a definitive LE diagnosis. Guess you'll find out! As for how this can be done without a breast, MRI imaging can be done on any part of the body so I'd assume you just lie there and listen to the racket the machine makes until it's done. If they're doing contrast do be sure not to let them use your at-risk arm. Let us know what you discover. Big, gentle (((((HUGS!!))))), Binney Oh, and hey! Editing this to say I'll be praying the \"area of concern\" will turn out to be NO concern at all. Be well! ",

The MOTC/L I believe means this is an Occupational Therapist with a masters degree (rather than a physical therapist or therapeutic massage therapist) -- my lymphedema therapist is also an occupational therapist, which I appreciate because her training gives her the tools to help me adapt activities to prevent further problems. CLT-LANA means s/he's been certified by an organization called the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA). It's a voluntary membership that requires a fee and a written test and has as a prerequisite that the therapist has taken at least 135 hours of specifically lymphedema training and has at least a year's experience treating it. So it's a very good thing. The LANA site is here: http://www.clt-lana.org VODDER is the name of one of the reliable lymphedema therapist training schools, so all good. LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE THERAPY is definitely the treatment you'll want if it turns out that you have lymphedema. It's also called Complete Decongestive Therapy, or CDT (or in the UK and Canada, it's usually CDP for Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.) Wouldn't want to make this too easy for us, would they?! Just a note here about certification of lymphedema therapists. There is no state in the U.S. that has state-mandated laws about who can practice lymphedema therapy, so anyone with PT, OT, or MT certification can legally treat lymphedema, even with no training in it. Aaaaaaaugh!!! There are \"schools\" that offer short courses in lymphedema treatment (a weekend, for instance) and then \"certify\" their grads. So anyone with a weekend of lymphedema training can call themselves a \"certified lymphedema therapist.\" That's a very sad state of affairs and makes finding good therapists very difficult. So LANA certification at least guarantees you that this therapist has been adequately trained to treat lymphedema. The other tricky thing to note is that LANA certification is voluntary, so many fully-trained and experienced lymphedema therapists are not LANA certified (mine is not, because she's so busy she's back-logged and doesn't want her name on the LANA site and end up with even more patients.) All I can say is, getting every state to enact certification standards for lymphedema therapists would certainly make our lives easier. Hope I haven't made this all more confusing.

      "Content": "Aug 16, 2010 12:19PM - edited Aug 16, 2010 12:22PM by Binney4 Sher, have you tried thread crochet without your garments? Once we have the skills to recognize early swelling and know what to do about it, we really are free to experiment with some things. If you're talking about sitting down in the evening to relax and crochet, why not try removing your garments and doing it for about 15 minutes? See what happens, and if it gives you no problem try extending the time by 5 minutes at a time and see what you can get away with. Of course start on a day when your LE is in good control. The trouble for me is that once I start on something I can't stand to put it down just because of my stupid arm. And like you, it was hard for me to get the yarn to move smoothly over my gloves, especially the seams. Very frustrating. Anyway I think part of the pleasure for me is feeling the fibers across my skin. I can only crochet for about 15 minutes at a time now, and that's more frustrating to me than not crocheting at all, so I've had to give it up. But we're all different, and if you don't try you won't know. I've taken up loom knitting. Not anywhere near as satisfying as my crochet projects, but it's highly portable and I can do it even with my garments on. My kids and I make hats for the cancer center, and from time to time I get enough 7\" x 9\" rectangles made to send off a box to the \"hug-aghan\" project on the \"Moving Beyond Cancer: Time to Circle the Wagons\" board. (See the \"Community Afghan\" thread there if you're not familiar with it--you send them squares and a couple of gals crochet them all together into an afghan for our bc.org Sisters who need some extra hugs.). Both projects do well with soft yarns, which have a nice feel as you work with them, they're small enough to haul around with me even in summer, and they work up quickly. I had to modify the hook tool so it's big enough and soft enough for my hand, but with that adjustment I don't have any trouble using it. There's a great Yahoo loom knitting discussion board if you have questions, \"KniftyKnitterLooms,\" and it had a sister site called \"LoomClass\" with free guided instruction in specific projects. It can get quite involved and it's possible to make all kinds of stitches and projects on the looms, so it's not as limiting as it first appears.  I've also had to make some adaptations for sewing, as cutting with a scissors makes my hand swell almost immediately. So I use a cutting wheel for cutting out all but the smallest details of patterns, and that's gotten to be second nature by now. (At first it was a cause for tears and pity parties that alternated with something close to rage -- adapting can be quite a dynamic process!) As for some of the other more dangerous crafts, like stained glass for instance, if that's what you loved it too would be worth trying and adapting. There are Kevlar gloves and sleeves you can buy pretty inexpensively that might help in some cases. Anything you can do to adapt and get on with life is a victory, and that's no small thing! Do let us know what you discover. Hugs, Sher! Binney Edited to add, we were posting at the same time, Celtic-Spirit -- brava to you for finding the ways to carry on!",

Whether you already have LE or are at risk for it, here's a way to make a difference in funding important research. Let me explain: a LE researcher named Mei Fu, from NYU, is interested in showing the importance of LE education for both risk reduction and on-going self-management. The idea is that OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS are supposed to take some ownership in educating their patients about their risk and how to manage it. Which of course means the professionals themselves will be learning about LE. Win/win! Here's a report about Mei Fu's newest study, which will be published this month: http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/vol/22/issue/98/article/1638 It's VERY HARD for LE researchers to get funding for their studies. (Why are we not surprised?!) Mei Fu got her funding for this one from the Avon Foundation, but she still needs their help to continue her work. OUR ASSIGNMENT, should we choose to accept it (does anybody else remember \"Mission: Impossible\"?) is to send an email to the Avon folks thanking them for their interest in LE and encouraging them to continue to fund studies that help us LE patients get the care we need. Of course you may mention you're a LE patient, and that getting LE information has been difficult, or whatever else you'd like to point out (briefly, of course!) Here's the person to contact at the Avon Foundation: Dr. Marc Hurlbert <Marc.Hurlbert@avonfoundation.org> There you go! Something concrete to do to make our voices heard! Thanks!

Also, I read somewhere (but now can't find it -- wish I were more organized ) that these women still had to wear compression garments. Don't know if that's true, but it'd be a bust. Wish we could talk to some of these women, don't you? Researchers never seem to address the problems quite the way we see them. Still, the good news is that someone is actually taking LE seriously as a problem that needs a cure, and hopefully it'll make others in the medical field more aware. Just MHO, Binney ",

It's complicated, but the way it stands now Medicare will only cover LE garments (or bandages) when there is an open wound, or lymph fluid leakage through the pores. In other words, only for very advanced, neglected LE. Then when the wound heals or the leakage stops, they stop paying again. Completely dreadful! And I actually know women on limited incomes who are waiting for wounds to develop so they could get new garments, which they then must wear for years if the wounds heal. Bob is advocating arguing instead that the garments are a prosthetic devise for a non-functioning body system (which of course they are), which is a category Medicare covers. So if you are appealing for coverage, this is the path to appeal. And the more of us who appeal and win, the easier it will become to get coverage without having to appeal. In the meantime, since this is all about as clear as mud, Bob is available to help anyone on an individual basis, no charge. Whew! Thanks, Bob! Binney",

So, having proved conclusively that you're not immune to getting LE, it would seem sensible and careful to avoid doing anything to stress things further. And by the way, since the other arm/hand are also at risk, you might want to look into getting a well fitting sleeve/gauntlet for that side as well. But then, unfortunately I DO have LE on my prophylactic side as well as my cancer side, so I guess I have pretty strong opinions on this. Hoping it goes smoothly and well for you! Binney",

Lili, our lymph sytem is indeed systemic and serves our entire body, but it's divided into four quadrants, each of which drain certain areas of the body. You can think of it like chicken quarters--the area affected by bc treatment is a wing quarter: hand, arm, shoulder, chest (or breast), back and side, all on the operated/radiated side (or in the case of bilateral surgery, on both sides). So the rest of your body (everything below the waist and above the neck) is not likely to be related to LE. Should it happen again you might want to check out all the other possible causes of swelling, including blood clots (which are treated as an emergency), in order to come up with a sensible explanation. (Some drugs can cause swelling like that, so if you were on any new drugs around that time, you might look into that as well.) Be well, all! Binney",

Whether you already have LE or are at risk for it, here's a way to make a difference in funding important research. Let me explain: a LE researcher named Mei Fu, from NYU, is interested in showing the importance of LE education for both risk reduction and on-going self-management. The idea is that OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS are supposed to take some ownership in educating their patients about their risk and how to manage it. Which of course means the professionals themselves will be learning about LE. Win/win! Here's a report about Mei Fu's newest study, which will be published this month: http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/vol/22/issue/98/article/1638 It's VERY HARD for LE researchers to get funding for their studies. (Why are we not surprised?!) Mei Fu got her funding for this one from the Avon Foundation, but she still needs their help to continue her work. OUR ASSIGNMENT, should we choose to accept it (does anybody else remember \"Mission: Impossible\"?) is to send an email to the Avon folks thanking them for their interest in LE and encouraging them to continue to fund studies that help us LE patients get the care we need. Of course you may mention you're a LE patient, and that getting LE information has been difficult, or whatever else you'd like to point out (briefly, of course!) Here's the person to contact at the Avon Foundation: Dr. Marc Hurlbert <Marc.Hurlbert@avonfoundation.org> There you go! Something concrete to do to make our voices heard! Thanks!

You can certainly put the vest on later. I considered it, but I wondered how nervous it would make my fellow passengers to see me emerge from a bathroom stall with my imitation-suicide-bomber vest on. I always wear mine under my clothes, but it takes some experimenting to find a shirt that works over it. I now own a couple just for that purpose and feel quite comfortable in it. It shows at the neckline so I basted a row of tatting my DIL made for me to the neckline and feel better about it. I think if you wear it over a shirt you'd have to be careful not to compress seams and wrinkles and bra straps into your skin, so I don't know how you'd do that. But do let us know what you discover.

Raili, I agree with Kira that the current percentages are conservative. There hasn't been agreement among researchers on the criteria they use for designating lymphedema, so the numbers are shaky at best. There are a lot of us here with lymphedema following SNB, and even many of us with lymphedema followiing prophylactic mastectomy. But in all fairness, this IS where someone with lymphedema would come, especially if they have a hard time getting it diagnosed, so the percentages of women here with lymphedema following SNB are probably exaggerated in the other direction. In other words, in this case, the \"percentages\" needn't worry you, because they're essentially meaningless! On the other hand, there is some recent research that indicates truncal (breast/chest) lymphedema is on the rise due to the higher rates of lumpectomy with SNB and rads -- in this case, the rads seem to be the culprit in increasing the problem. But even there, doctors are so slow to diagnose breast LE that it's impossible to estimate the extent of the problem. As the research community comes together on criteria, and the studies stretch out a bit over time, we'll have better answers. Hopefully they'll also discover some of the predisposing factors, so we'll get better at predicting exactly who is at risk for LE and who isn't. In the meantime, for goodness sake don't obsess over cuts and scratches! What kind of life is that?! Instead, keep some individually-wrapped antiseptic wipes and  a few bandaids with you and use them whenever the skin is compromised. If you also follow the other simple lifestyle guidelines listed in the risk reduction position paper they'll soon become a habit and not a burden, and you very well may spare yourself this particular form of chronic grief. The fact is, you're at risk for lymphedema, so give yourself the best chance of avoiding it by learning what steps to take and doing them routinely. I have to agree with geebung (Hi, geebung! Haven't seen your dear joey avatar in a while -- so good to hear things are going so well for you!) that an appointment with a well-qualified LE therapist for early evaluation, baseline measurements for future reference, and personalized risk reduction tips -- as well as fitting for a compression sleeve and glove to wear prophylactically when exercising or traveling -- is a great idea. You aren't going to get that kind of information and help from your doctors, so do yourself a favor and insist on a referral for evaluation. Here's a page about finding a well-trained lymphedema therapist near you: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm This gets easier, honest! Be well, Binney",

Mine are blue (baby size), red (small child), green (older kid or adult), yellow (large adult). I can use two strands of worsted-weight yarn on any of them and they come out fine. Or I use a larger yarn (Lion Brand Homespun) and a thin novelty yarn together for a fun color and texture combination. Like you, I started out too tight and have learned to wrap VERY loosely, which is better for my hands and the finished texture, both. I've made some fun prostheses on the red round loom, using a weaving technique for the flat back surface. I learned it in a loom-knitting pattern book that I love called \"Learn New Stitches on Circle Looms\" by Anne Bipes. (I ordered the book on-line). It has great hats, scarves, shawls, and afghans, all made on the circle looms. The weaving idea is the top of a hat pattern in the book, but I adapted the method for the smaller loom and it works great. That book really opened my eyes to the possibilities of loom knitting, but I have yet to take full advantage of it. Mostly we just make chemo hats and afghan squares, which are quick and satisfying, and easy enough you can do it without having to concentrate on counting stitches. There are a number of knitting loom manufacturers, and they all have slightly different qualities. Some looms have very close, smaller pegs and knit much finer fabrics, but I haven't tried them because just now I like finishing projects fairly quickly. With the smaller gauge looms you can even make socks fairly easily. I'd say just experiment with the looms you have and various yarn combinations. If you're using two strands, they don't have to be the same kind or color of yarn, so the possibilities are endless without being complicated. And if you want to go for something more challenging, there are all manner of patterns and instructions on-line that will have you knitting intricate intarsia sweaters. If you haven't signed up for the Yahoo \"KniftyKnitterLooms\" discussion board, do! Very delightful bunch of ladies (and men) at all levels of skill and experience, including many loom knitting pattern designers. The sister \"LoomClass\" site has hundreds of patterns from easy to daunting. Great fun! Don't know if any of that helps -- hope so! Onward! Binney",

If you have a well-qualified lymphedema therapist already, and s/he's someone you can work well with, ask her to help you through this time. Though she can't do a complete MLD during rads, she can teach you a daily routine you can use to help keep your affected quadrant clear by stimulating lymph nodes and doing some deep breathing and gentle exercise. Ask her about using arm and hand compression prophylactically during rads, and if she agrees that would be helpful, have her monitor the fit of garments to be sure they're just right for you. Other risk reduction suggestions here: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/riskreduction_for_l...

That term is generally reserved for our day garments. Solaris-type garments are usually considered \"non-elastic,\" even though there is a bit of stretch to the covering material. (I doubt we could even get them on if they didn't have a bit of \"give.\") There are therapists who believe that only wrapping should be used at night and everything else is worthless. And there are therapists and fitters who think only the classic Reid Sleeve should ever be used in place of wrapping. They're all entitled to their opinions, but we lymphers are all entitled to know what our options are and be able to choose what's best for us from everything that's available. Yesterday I went to my fitter's for my twice-yearly garment spree , and she said (as an aside), \"I just hate to see patients come in here with a Classic Reid Sleeve prescription, because I just know they'll never wear it.\" Which certainly matches my own experience -- I know LOTS of lymphers with classic Reid Sleeves, but I don't know anyone who wears it. Reid Sleeves tend to live lonely lives in the backs of closets. Complaints include inflexibility, needing an entire queen-sized bed all to oneself, loss of sleep, difficulty packing it for travel, not being able to toss it into the washer and dryer, and complications of fitting and adjustment. I'm sure there are happy Classic Reid Sleeve users out there -- I just don't know any. BUT In all fairness, there are probably people for whom the CRS is the only thing that works for them, so I sure don't want to write it off. And for the record, TheReidSleevePeople make a sleeve similar to JoviPak and Solaris, called the Opera sleeve (or something musical like that: Symphony? Sonata?), and I DO know lymphers who are happy with those. And let us not forget that TheReidSleevePeople provide us all with free LE alert bands, without which we'd be even more at the mercy of our uninformed medical pesonnel. (Geesh, do I ever sound cynical today -- sorry!) I suspect fitters and therapists are in some cases bound by exclusionary contracts with various manufacturers. They also expect (and get) various perks from the suppliers, so that also encourages loyalty to one manufacturer or another. That's just standard businss practice, but it does interfere with our ability to get the range of products we need, since we're all so different. I absolutely LOVE coming here and finding out about new products from women who try them and use them (or hate them). And I also love it that some of our LE product manufacturers read these boards in order to get the feedback they need to improve their garments. THANK YOU FOR CARING, ALL YOU GARMENT FOLKS! Be well!
