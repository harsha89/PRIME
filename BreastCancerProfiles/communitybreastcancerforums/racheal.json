So I called a breastfeeding helpline - who said to get it checked out as significant changes could indicate malignancy . When I went to the doctor - he simply said that was not possible & if I was really worried to give a sample & it would be screened for infection - which I am in the process of doing & returning to the surgery .  However since the trip to the doctor that breast has become more tender - itchy & lumpy - with a small but firm lump on one side - Has anyone ever experienced anything like this ? I have never really thought about bc before - having breastfed all my kids (3) & it not being in our family - . Am I right to be worried ? or should I take what the doc has said - it is nothing .? There is no sign of mastitis or thrush & no pain - cept tender where the lumpiness is , & no blocked ducts either . So I researched DCIS - could this be a possibilty  & like I said the left breast is still fine & the baby feeds fine from that . Log in to post a reply",
