My stage is early but the grade is 3 and the OncoType DX came back 30, thus chemo...   I cut my long hair to the nape of my neck and donated it to Locks of Love and have my medicinal arsenal ready.  I am anxious and tightly wound about chemo tomorrow, but hopefully I can relax and calm down a little tonight once all my little ones are asleep.  Anyone doing chemo with small children at home to care for?  I have four aged 7, 6, 3 1/2 and 2yrs.  We have hired help and placed the little ones in day care until 5pm to help me handle the fatigue soon to come.  Hopefully this will go well and not scare them too much. Good luck to all starting this week!! Drim- thanks for answering my question. Will take the frozen peas with me tomorrow. I also liked the Claritin advice to off-set SE from Neulasta shot.  I also bought a really funny adult humor joke book on a whim to make me laugh out loud when needed.  Hope this is a good week for you.",

      "Content": "May 18, 2010 02:28AM - edited May 18, 2010 02:30AM by ClaudetteK Hi everyone!  Thank you SO much for the notes of encouragement and advice.  I started today and really felt prepared and after a while even relaxed during the infusion.  All the advice helped today go well (water, water and more water)!  I've no idea what tomorrow will bring, but I know it will be better than not having found this site.  I do have a tip for handling chemo with little ones. If your 2yr and 3yr old are like mine, they will hang around any potty like it's a water cooler at work. \"Leighton, look at my poopie!\"  \"It's blue, Ainsley!!\"  \"I know, we had bday cupcakes at preschool today\" then crying because I don't have a spare cupcake for Leighton...  Anyway due to all the toxic pee, I was told to keep them away from that toilet if possible b/c they touch the entire thing, and to double flush with lid closed plus wipe with and antibacterial wipe.   Fotopet- thanks for adding me and good luck tomorrow. Redbarb, Drim, Country Frau-  thanks for the encouragement- keep letting us know how you are progressing.  Hope you all feel well this week.  I go in tomorrow for IV hydration and a Neulasta shot, then hopefully rest before dinner and bedtime routine...",
