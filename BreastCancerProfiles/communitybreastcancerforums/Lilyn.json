It's funny at my hospital here in Toronto I could have sworn they gave me a cupcake when I had finished my chemo.  Maybe I'm dreaming I cant remember but I dont think they had a bell.  Boy it is amazing what I cant remember sometimes (age or chemo ha ha) Best wishes Lois",

Evergreen your recommendations are great. i wish I ate as healthy as that. I am trying but I am not big on veggies (which of course are so important). I drink green tea at least once a day and have definitely tried to cut back on sugar. I only have 1 or 2 glasses of wine a week now.

You mentioned that you didn't like the look of the lymph node on the U/S machine. It really is impossilble for us to decipher an US image unless your a imaging tech or radiologist I would think. Things always seemed to be strange looking on those screens my sister always did that,looked at the screen and terrified herself. Her biopsies have been negative. You will get the results and you and your doctor will know where to go from there, if it is benign they will tell you what folllow up is required, if it is not you will proceed with recommendations. Try to stay calm dear, I know NOT easy to do I know. sending you hugs and best wishes.",

I ended up having bilateral breast cancer two tumours in one breast and one in the other. I am also triple positive and did chemo and a year of Herceptin. Wanted you to know that was in 2009. I look back now amazed at myself how I did it all, but you know what we do it. Chemo always seems such an awful thing but actually did not have much of a problem they give you all kinds of pill for nausea etc before. Hair loss is strange for sure, starts to slowly come out about two weeks after starting chemo, I just ended up getting it buzzed. I wore soft scarves and lots of very pretty earrings. It will seem like a long time coming back but slowly and surely it does. I used to get quite annoyed watching those commercials when shampoo models were swishing their long hair about. I wish you strength and love I know it is such a challenge but you will go step by step and in six years you will be looking back and writing to another women who is facing our journey xo Lois ",
