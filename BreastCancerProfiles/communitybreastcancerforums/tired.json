No go!  IT RIPPED the stitches all across ed the bottom because of the pressure!  He did Imm. sur.removed the expander, NOTHING came out!!  NO FLUID at all!  When I ask him after sur. were did it go? he said, I don't know!!!  He put in a new expan. re-stitched it up, said he CLEANED it out?  I have two drains now for 9 1/2 weeks.  I am set for surg. Thurs. 28th.  My left side is Hugh again, he took the drains out Monday and the 28th I WAS to have my implants!  Not going to happen!  Looks like I have a infection inside, they will do a culture, take out expander & PACK my breast!  When they get the results, they will decide which antibiotic to give me by IV, in the mean time I will go every few days they pull out the packing and replace.  Now it will have to heal up!  PLEASE, IF YOU ARE DRANING MORE THAN 8 WEEKS, MAKE YOUR PS, GO IN AND DO A CULTURE!!!!!  More than likely IT IS an INFECTION!    ",
