I would get off the Xanax as soon as you can, but talk to your doctor FIRST. A longer-acting anxiolitic (anxiety reducing drug)like Ativan would be much better and less likely to cause dependence. It's your business, but I think there are a lot better drugs for anxiety than Xanax. They will all make you rather tired, spacey, but who of us doing chemo isn't already?",
