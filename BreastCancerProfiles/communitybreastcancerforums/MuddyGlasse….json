Once I stopped the Pepcid and started taking glutamine for the gastritis, it was all well. (this is not glucosamine, it is GLUTAMINE -- helps the lining of the stomach.) Eni PS: if you like, check out the art I've been recently creating to help the healing process: muddyglasses.com/cancerclub/ch... . Thanks!",
