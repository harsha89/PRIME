I'm sure glad that my surgeon said I might need only 4 sessions. Well, it's a hell lot better than 8 sessions :) I'm still pretty bummed about losing my hair through chemo, but I'm trying to have fun getting a wig and buying some scarves. I'm still trying to perfect the \"it's okay\" song and dance number whenever people try to hint on my reaction about losing hair.  Over-all, it won't be such a bad birthday and Christmas :) Happy Holidays ladies! :) ",

The \"underbelly\" of my arm (not exactly the armpit) is very sensitive, a bit prickly, sort of like a shafing sensation. My BS said to rub it occassionally to get it used to the pressure. My BS is female and she is kinda cool. After asking her if it would be okay to drink alcohol given the Christmas party season..  she said, \"Go! Have fun! Drink as much as you can. Once you start chemo you can't drink anymore!\". Made me sad to hear that but I did follow her advice. LOL! Hi Barb, I'd be sooo bothered if I heard a sloshing sound. I'm between a cup A and B so I'm not sure if the size has anything to do with how much fluid can be stored in the breast. =P Sometimes, I do feel a sloshing motion, but in the upper back side of my arm, not in the breast. Sounds weird eh? Not so sure what's normal and weird anymore since I found out I have BC about a month ago... :P",

I'm 2 weeks past my lumpectomy and SNB and it is still sore. Not as numb as before and I think judging from webwriter's comments, the shafing sensation is a common side effect. Just take things one day at a time. 3 days after surgery, I've managed to slightly raise my arm, not much difficulty in taking of my shirt. It's been 2 weeks now and I can take off my bra snap from behind with both arms. My BS said that I can drive in 3-5 weeks, by that time I'll probably have a better range of motion on my arm. Don't try to force it, I think your progress will depend on your day to day activities.",

My stylist didn't want to give me a buzz cut, he instead gave me a Rihanna cut. He wanted to give me \"layers\" to hide the bald spots so that I could still walk around the house without a scarf/bandanna on.. LOL. I humored him but wished that he cut it a bit shorter because I'm still shedding and I find the strands still too long. I'm having my wig adjusted tomorrow since I look like Dora the Explorer. My stylist tried to give justice to the wig by giving me a bob cut with layers but it just doesn't fit right! It gets hot and itchy. Sometimes I think I can pull off a bandanna look and just leave the wig at home. I'm praying the weeks go by quickly. After the 4th treatment, my hair can start growing back. I can't wait! I can't believe I've taken for granted the way we run our hands through our hair, or how we haphazardly tie a ponytail... Hmmm, I truly am obsessed... ;) I guess this is just my way of coping with BC.. :) ",

Herceptin for 1 year Tamoxifen for 5 years Since my estrogen receptiveness is quite high, he's also recommending that I stop my period by giving me shot (I forget the name of the med, starts with a L). Since I'm only 29 and single, he's asking me to think about it because there is no assurance that my period will ever come back. Hence, the possibility of never having kids. The tamoxifen is a bummer because i can't have kids for 5 years, but at least with that, I know I may start trying after 5 years. My friends tell me to think about saving my life first before thinking of another life. If it's meant to be, my period will come back. I'm starting to think that way as well.

To ease your worries, I would suggest to at least get an ultrasound, then a biopsy after if it looks highly suspicious. No use waiting for 3 months. What for?? If it's fibrocystic, then no prob. But what if it's malignant? Not scaring you but wouldn't you want to find out sooner? Anyway, ultrasound and biopsy are painless. Biopsy was something I was dreading but took less time than the ultrasound, which was slightly uncomfortable and embarassing because  your breasts are exposed and gelled to the max! But after the doctor was called in by the technician, I couldn't care less if he wanted to put peanut butter then rub it in with his hands!   I wish you all the best and hope that this is nothing to be worried about ... :) ",
