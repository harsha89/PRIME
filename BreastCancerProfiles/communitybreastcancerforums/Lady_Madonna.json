    "Content": "Lady_Madonna wrote: My pre-surgery MRI found an increased number of lymph nodes on the breast cancer side.  The lymph nodes were \"otherwise unremarkable,\" so no swelling (and my SNB was negative for cancer) but I'm curious about what this means.  Anyone else have this?  Have I always had more lymph nodes on this side?  Can an adult grow lymph nodes in response to disease?  I find this very interesting, and it has to be more than a coincidence.  Log in to post a reply",
