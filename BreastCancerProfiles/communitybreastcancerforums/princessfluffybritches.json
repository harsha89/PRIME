I have no results yet. So what I gather so far is that it's uncommon to find a growth on an extremity prior to finding a primary cancer site, and if the growth metastasized from the breast to the thigh, they would find breast cancer cells in the growth on my thigh.  And if my breast cancer has metastacized  to a growth on my thigh, it can mean that the breast cancer has metastacized to other areas as well Prior to the thigh because the thigh is not a choice site for a breast cancer. This is all from the reading I have done.  It sounds like I have one foot in the grave and a growth on my thigh is not a very good sign.  I have no symptoms of anything.   Serves me right for doing a lot of reading on the internet.  I have a hard time absorbing all this potential most likely diagnosis.  I'm very depressed but don't let anyone see it.   Surgery 7/12/2018 Targeted Therapy 7/13/2018 Ibrance (palbociclib) Hormonal Therapy 7/13/2018 Femara (letrozole) Dx 7/21/2018, ILC, Left, Stage IV, metastasized to bone/other, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "princessfluffybritches wrote: Hi.  I had a round growth on the top of my thigh, not inner thigh.  It was round and was like thick and slightly raised.  But it started to get bigger so I went to the Dermatologist.  The area is now 1 inch wide and very thick raised skin like a plaque still growing in a roundish shape with a few a few \"arms\" under the thick skin on the outer area.  It started about 6 months ago, and I didn't think much of it until it started to grow outward. So she does a \"shave\" biopsy, a month later she gets the results and says \"metastatic carcinoma\".  I also had a mammo 3 months ago that was clean.  So I am really worried and can't wait for my Oncology appt. in 2 days.  Like everyone I've been combing the internet trying to find a picture that looks like this thick skin area and nothing comes close.  I did read that metastatic carcinoma is most likely from the breast, so I'm assuming breast cancer.   Maybe I'm jumping the gun.  It's hard being in limbo.  I was very grateful to find this forum and be able to read about others' journeys and how some good attitudes have come from it.  I want to have a good attitude as well and continue my life as it is for as long as I can.  No one knows how long .  I'm trying to be prepared.  But I do feel alone.
