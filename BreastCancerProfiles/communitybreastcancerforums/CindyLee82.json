I found a lump made an appt with dr. Started having swelling in my armpit and aching. Went for a ultrasound and mammogram and radiologist said it was benign by looking at it but would do a biopsy just to be sure. Then I started getting sharp pains in breast behind my nipple and then on side and underneath breast. Went for Biopsy and Dr said looks exactly like a Fibroadenoma. But I was still worried due to the pain and swelling. It turned out to be Benign and a Fibroadenoma like they thought and I think my own stress was causing me to have issues with my hormones and make pain worse. Try not to stress, but it's great you are being your own advocate and making sure. My Mom was diagnosed at 36, that's why they did the biopsy on mine",
