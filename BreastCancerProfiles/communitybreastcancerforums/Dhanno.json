Frankly the BS did a beautiful job. No pain lovely scar healing .It is just sad that margins are unclear . He has warned me that second re excision means smaller breast which will shrink more after radiation . But I will take a chance but if I can skip radiation after mastectomy then it will be a big consolation . Dx 5/20/2018, IDC, Left, 2cm, Grade 1, 0/5 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

But BC gave me a gift. It revealed the emotional side of my husband who was always loving but never sentimental .Now I want to recover for him Luckily my boys handled it well The younger one who is 15 year old told me if it is breast cancer early stage I do not need to worry as BC has the best prognosis. I was amazed by his knowledge and composure. We live in Brisbane He has his grade 12 exam this year. I am happy to see that he did not lose his focus towards studies even after knowing his mothers diagnosis So let us all count our blessings and do our best to get well soon for our families",

The lady sitting next to me had bilateral mastectomy and the surgeon seem to have done a fantastic job .From outside her breasts looked perfect . I even complimented her .
