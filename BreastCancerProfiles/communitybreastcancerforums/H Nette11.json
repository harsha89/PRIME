I had stage111 Her2 nu + ERT+. 17 lymph nodes removed, 8 were positive and one was starting to escape lymph node but did not make it. I had a year of FEC,  a yr. of taxotere. 6 wks of radiation, a flubbed reconstuction. DR. forgot to tell me to stop Femara before diep flap surgery. Femara can cause the blood to clot and with a diep fat they use the fat and blood vessels from the stomach. I gained weight for it but came out with a tummy tuck. The nurses argued outside my rm. not to get the\"flaps\" because the doppler noise annoyed them. I could not wake up enough to say anything but I heard them. Long story short several surgeries later I have a lattisimus Dorsi flap and the girls are not even. I did not bother with a nipple.  To be honest I think the long surgeries are harder on the body and mind than the chemo.  It's all good now. I am alive and was blessed to be at my son's wedding 3 yrs. ago and getting ready to fly to see my Grandbaby in 2wks. I really don't sweat the small stuff so much anymore and my relationships are the most important thing in my life.   I wish you all the best. I hope my story gives you hope.",

I received a year of FEC \"cocktails\", and a yr. of Herceptin when that was done. I took 3 mo.s off followed by 6 wks of radiation. I worked through all of it, it wasn't easy but I am thankful to have been able to be there for major milestones in my grown children's lives. Just got home from trying to catch some fish they did not bite but the sunset was beautiful and the breeze relaxing. Hang in there and think positive thoughts and don't feel guilty about getting all the rest you need and keep us posted.",

In 2001  I was diagnosed with stage 111 breast cancer, her2 nu+, ERT positive with lymph node involvment, 8 positive nodes and 17 nodes removed.  I got chemo on Friday, slept all day Saturday, felt nauseated (a little) on Sunday AM and worked in public school full time. I left work early the week before DR. visits for lab work and occasionally for Dr. appointments. I had chemo for a year and radiation for 6 wks., after a couple months reprieve between the two kinds of therapy. My kids were in high school, now my son is out of college, has a job in a beautiful state, married to a wonderful gal for 3 yrs. and they are now expecting their first child. This is not a fairy tale story, it was tough but I got through it. I also got Her2Nu after all the chemo, my nails are still thin and brittle, but I am here and very grateful! I wish the very best to all who are going through this now. Dx Stage 3,her2+, Prog+, ERP, with 17 nodes removed, 8 positive & a left side massectomy",

I only iced for Taxotere, thank goodness it only drips for about 15 minutes. They gave me a bowl of ice of to  dip my fingers in and dropped ice bags on my toenails. Once I quit taking my fingers in and out of the ice, they got numb and it was a little easier. Best of luck with your treatments, you'll be in my thoughts and prayers. Oh, I was given Taxotere after a year of FEC. I took chemo on Friday afternoon and worked full time, but I slept most of the weekend. This was in 2001. Take care.",
