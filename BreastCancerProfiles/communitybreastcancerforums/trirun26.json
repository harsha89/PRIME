Yes, as both of you said it will be a long year due to the mastectomy, however the MONSTER will be gone, yeah!!!! a very good friend of mine went through it 5 years ago and did fine, she actually loves her boobs ! I am very nervous about my surgery eventhough as of right now it is a lumpectomy...so far my right is fine..but I will have to be checked in 6 months and so on and so on...if I have to have another lumpectomy I say CUT THEM OFF! I am young as well (41) and very active with doing triathlons, working, having fun with the hubby so this whole thing as been a  pain.  anyway, keep in touch and I will certainly pray for both of you and all the women going through this. Lets have a great weekend!!! Peace to all...alicia",

I am scheduled for my left breast lumpectomy on june 4 after my core biopsy came back 'borderline DCIS\". When I asked my surgeon if I was going to need radiation after he said I was jumping ahead because my biopsy had not completely confirmed DCIS and that we needed to wait for the final path report...this is only causing me more anxiety!!!! as I want to know what my plan is.  I posted in another area if anyone had heard of this \"borderline\" path report..it is making me more nervous, in my opinion it is or it is not. Let us know when your surgery is...we can send each other \"cyber positive thinking\"!! We are all going to get through this for sure...it is just a BIG INCONVENIENCE!! bye for now...Alicia PS I love this site!  ",

The surgery was a little more involved than expected, the surgeon explained to my husband (as I was totally sick to my stomach from the anethesia ;-() that he had to take out a bigger area than expected as well as going down to the muscle area. Oh well, I just pray the margins are clean. Also, I learned that I keloid under the biopsy site....lovely....so he is very worried that I will keloid with this incision and has recommended that I get radiation tx for keloid prevention. I have now researched this and yes it is done often but I don't know anyone who has had it. Do any of you know about this? I am very sore but feeling better today. I can manage this beast! I pray that my final path is okay and that the margins are clean. Thank you linda for your good thoughts!  God Bless all of you Alicia",
