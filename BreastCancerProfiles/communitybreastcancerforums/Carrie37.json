My GYN (she also talked to my MO who is also on board)thinks I should have a hysterectomy with ovaries and tubes removed but I can't help but wonder if it necessary. I am 40 and done with babies. My BC was ER+ and PR+ and my periods stopped during chemo but they've come back full force. I've had a biopsy and D&C in the last year because of the bleeding. FSH numbers are elevated and estrogen is normal so she thinks I'm perimenopausal. Any thoughts? Particularly interested in anyone who\u2019s had the same surgery and what their side effects were.I'm scared of yet another surgery but more scared of cancer coming back. Anyone premenopausal ever have a hysterectomy?

I am waiting on results of the Her2 but I am ER+ and PR+. It is unbelievable at times but then reality comes, I hope you have good support from family and friends but if not, this is a good place for support and info. My BS said on Friday that we would start with surgery but that is on hold now because of a concern from the MRI. A suspicious lymph node that they now have to biopsy because my insurance won't pay for a PET scan. Anyway, I hope you have more answers and are doing okay.",
