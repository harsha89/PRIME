I wish your mom, you and ur family the best!",

I am on the verge of tears here just reading those words, that's wonderful! I am definitely grateful to have found this site.  Well we just met w/ a 2nd surgeon for that second opinion and have decided to go with her rather than the first surgeon we met because we just feel more comfortable/confident that she will provide the best treatment.  Preparing for the next couple of tests (bloodwork) and the date of the surgery...which will most likely be a lumpectomy...and still trying to live life normally and of course preparing for mother's day this wknd Again, Congratulations on being cancer FREE!!!!!

She was actually the doctor we went to for a second opinion. May I take a moment to vent? I am getting very frustrated and upset w/ certain family members calling my mother 3 times daily and NOT b/c they want to see how SHE'S doing, but for HER to comfort THEM!!!!!!! I do tell her that she should tell them that its giving her more grief than if they would never call at all! But I hold back a lot and i sure don't vent on her b/c I don't want to cause added stress, but I am to the pt that I WILL call them and give a piece of my mind! Okay, I got it out, my 20yr old sis and I discuss this almost daily b/c its a build up of things that has happened in the past w/ the fam...its just ridiculous how SELFISH ppl are!
