Now I know this isn't the place to get help get diagnosed but my whole family is switching doctors and my first time to get in isn't till June. :( Basically I stopped wearing deodorant and shaving for about two weeks when I went on a vacation to a cold place. I came home and first instinct was to shave my underarms and put on deodorant, so I did and ended up waking up the next day with and extremely sore painful tender swollen bump under neath my R underarm. I have really bad anxiety so I was experiencing a lot of physical symptoms of my anxiety as well and just felt terrible. Any ways I took matters into my own hands and started icing / heating my under arm and taking vitamin c and apple cider vinegar. My symptoms were just about gone by last week, and the bump was much much smaller. Fast forward a week later and I decided to try out a new all natural deoderant for the day. I woke up the next day with extreme itching under my arms and feel super swollen again. I also just feel swollen and sore in my breasts as well especially the right one and just kind of swollen all over the armpit - breast - shoulder area. Im super nervous and don't what this could be since im only 20 and have no lumps in my breasts.. I also typically have always had soreness - pain - swelling in my breasts / r breast durning my cycle but I don't know If this correlates... Im super scared and dont know what to do to till I go to my doctor... Log in to post a reply",
