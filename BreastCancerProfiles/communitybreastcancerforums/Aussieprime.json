I already know I have at least one axilla node cancerous but she said when doing the biopsy today it was only very slightly enlarged by like 0.3mm and could be reactive due to recent chest infection which was treated with 10 days of antibiotics...but obviously I'm concerned Dx 6/14/2018, DCIS/IDC, Right, 4cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Not given me a stage as I have to have CT scan and bone scan Wednesday and blood tests to check it's not spread past lymph nodes ( another anxious wait where every ache I'm convinced the worst) But it's a 3.5cm lump on ultrasound but surgeon says around 4cm. Grade 2-3 combination of DCIS/IDC. ER - PR- Her 2 + Surgery booked for 02/07/18 - mastectomy with immediate implant recon and axillary node clearance ,then chemo with Herceptin and possible radiotherapy after. I was upset about this and hasn't really prepared for the mastectomy word as was hoping I could have a lumpectomy but trust my surgeon I dont really know what any of it really means even though I've spent 2.5 hrs there with them...not sure I was in the frame of mind as just kept giving me so much information Meeting surgeon again Thursday to go through CT/bone scan results....hoping they come back ok if anyone has similar to me I'd appreciate some comments or thoughts Thanks in advance xoxo Dx 6/14/2018, DCIS/IDC, Right, 4cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 2, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
