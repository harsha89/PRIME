I saw a breast surgeon this morning who is sending me for an ultrasound and mammogram. I had nipple pain and discharge. I also have bc on both sides of my family, essentially every female relative. My obgyn initally saw me and told me that if it was an intraductal papilloma that the surgeon would want to remove it because it can hide other cancerous cells that may grow down the road or may be there. I am not saying that you should get it removed, that was my obgyns reasoning why it would be recommened. She told me that once it was removed it would be tested to ensure that it was benign. It is your body, so if you don't want to get it removed, you don't have to, but that you may need more frequent screenings. Other ladies on this site have responded to some of my posts and have told me that often one papilloma is not indicative of cancer. Of course, there are always execptions. I am not sure about calcifications. I will be going for my first ultrasound and mammogram sometime soon. The people on this site are wonderful and very knowledgeable, I hope this post bumps you so that other members can provide you more information. I am sorry I can't help more! Best wishes for a good outcome! ",

She then did a breast exam, said i have \"lumpy breasts\", and seemed to be finding things to be normal. Until she came to a spot under/behind my nipple. She paused, made a face, put pressure on the painful spot a few times and said that she is referring me to a breast surgeon. I asked her why. She wrote down the word \"intraductal papilloma\" on a post it, handed to me, and said \"I don't think you have breast cancer. If it is an intraductal papilloma, they will remove that part of your milk duct. \" then she said her nurse would schedule the appointment with the surgeon, and she walked out of the room. WTF was that? Can any of you ladies help me understand what an intraductal papilloma is? How can she diagnose something without any imaging? I have never had any imaging (mammo, ultrasound...) performed as I am only 29. What is the breast surgeon going to do? Do they do imaging or just go in for a biopsy? My appointment is on March 27th. I am really confused and a little scared, but my husband is super freaked out so i am pretending that i completely understand it and i am fine. My mother who had DCIS is too upset to talk to me. They are kind of making me feel like I have the black plague! I really appreciate any insight into these questions so i can prepare myself for my appointment with the surgeon. I guess I will pop over to a different board as well? Thanks anyone and everyone who reads this. You are all tremendous women and men who have built this online safe haven that has helped me feel like some people are not afraid of me or my body.",

I am now waiting to be scheduled for an ultrasound and mammogram to investigate. The breast surgeon attempted to express discharge, but was unable to. She said that is a good sign, and that perhaps it was dried up milk stuck in a duct that came out. She said the clear bloody part could have been due to the duct being irritated by the dried up milk. Or it could be something else, hence the imaging. I have never had a breast ultrasound or mammogram as I am only 29, so I guess it begins. My mother was diagnosed at 40 with dcis that became invasive to the surrounding tissue and lymph nodes. Her oncologist suggested I start mammograms at age 30, and since I will be turning 30 in October, I guess this is right on time. At least my insurance shouldnt give me too much push back.",

      "Content": "mommy2lilfi wrote: hi everyone, I am a 29 yr old female with a strong family history of a grab bag of bc types on both sides. My mother was diagnosed at 40 with DCIS, presenting with nipple discharge and discomfort. Her doctors could not find any lumps and brushed her off for months until she insisted on a biopsy. The DCIS was busy and by the time they did the surgery it had begun to spread to lymph nodes and the surrounding tissue. What brings me here is that a week ago I began to have pain in my nipple and breast. There was no trauma, it just started to hurt. I figured it may be related to my cycle due in 2 weeks, or maybe I slept on my breast funny. Anyhow, after about five days of fairly intense pain I looked closer at my nipple while changing my shirt and it looked wet, shiny. So I gave it a little squeeze and white-yellow-green discharge came out easily, followed by a clear, blood tinged discharge. Once the discharge stopped \"flowing\" I conducted a self breast exam. My breasts have always felt lumpy to me, so I can't say if I feel any new lumps. I have been pregnant or breastfeeding from 2011-January 2014, so I am not very familiar with their \"usual\" feeling. I have contacted my doctor and have an appointment next week. I was wondering if you can offer any advice on the type of screening I should request in the event that they just do a manual exam and send me on my way. I have no idea if I have bc, and I understand that most of the time pain and discharge is relatively normal or relating to a begin condition. I just want to be sure that the doctors give me a complete evaluation given my family history. Thank you for reading this, and I hope to report back to you all after my appointment that everything is a ok. Log in to post a reply",

It seems like you noticed the change in your breast quickly, so that is great.
