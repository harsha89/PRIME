You can also visit the YSC message boards - I think there is a category about pregnancy after BC.  You might find some help there.   ",

I met with my surgeon twice before surgery.  Once to give me my diagnosis, then again to talk to me about surgery - then of course, a few hours before surgery.  I met with the plastic surgeon the week after I was diagnosed to go over options if I wanted a mastectomy.  The PS specifically told me that if I go the bilateral or uni mastectomy route with reconstruction/TEs to scehdule another appointment with him to talke about it more.  He did not want our second visit to be in the operating room.  I went with a lumpectomy instead.  I did get fitted for a post surgery sports bra (what I like to call it.)  It is pretty much a sports bra with a zipper in the front.  The funny thing was - all the associates in the store were telling me \"Oh, this is what your surgeon loves for his patients to have after a lumpectomy.\"  Insurance only covered one of the bras and they were trying to convince me to buy another for when the other was in the wash etc.  . . It was $57 and I knew I'd only be wearing it for a month tops.  When I saw the surgeon the day of my surgery I asked him about how often I should be wearing the sports bra I was fitted for and if I should buy another  He basically told me any old sports bra would do - didn't even need the one that the sales associates were pushing on me.  However, if you do go with a mastectomy you will need to be fitted. ",

I'm scheduled for a BMX with TE's on 7/16 - the instructions I have from my PS recommends going to a beauty salon for the first 2 weeks to have my hair washed and styled as I will have limited arm movement.  Does 2 weeks sound about right to go without being able to wash your own hair without help?  I'm trying to co-ordinate babysitting and all that since I have two little ones at home - so I would need someone to drive me to my post op appts and to the hairdresser if needed.  I typically wash my hair every 3 days - hubby says he'd wash it for me but would rather me go to the salon to relax and have them \"do my hair up\" - ha ha......  Do you think I can get by with salon appts for only 1 week as opposed to 2?  When were you all able to resume showering and hairwashing if you had a BMX?  Thanks so much!",

After the re-excision they still did not know if they got it all. They recommended either watch and wait, another re-exicison or a mastectomy. I went and got another opinion and opted for a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. Everyone is different, but to me, not having clear margins the first time around was a sign to do the mastectomy. That was what I had originally wanted, and what my gut told me to do. I had to have re-excisions because I had little satellite tumors around the main tumor. Had I done the bilateral mastectomy initially, I would have avoided 2 extra uneeded surgeries.

      "Content": "Jun 27, 2010 12:11PM - edited Jun 27, 2010 12:29PM by in_cognito Hi NorthernGirl! I had to have a re-excision a few weeks ago that showed another 1 mm of multifocal IDC.  I think there are still small multifoci left in there, thus I am opting for a mastectomy.  My breasts are dense to begin with and I did not have a palpable lump.  I had a newborn that refused to nurse on that side - which was my blessing in disguise.  I actually wish I would have done the mastectomy instead of the re-excision but my BS said it was not necessary at the time and three BS's talked me out of a mastectomy when I was diagnosed.  But now that there is more cancer they recommend a mastectomy (I've gotten a few other opinions as well).  I'm fine with that - I did not want to do radiation to begin with.  I am choosing a bilateral - I have two very small children, my breasts are too dense, I do not want to live in fear, and my BRCA results were inconclusive.  I have a strong family history on my dad's side - I believe I would be BRCA  3,4,5,or 6 once more research happens down the road.  Everyone chooses their treatment based on their personal history.  I will also be doing chemo - does my Oncotype warrant it?  No - but the Oncotype research is for 10 years.  I need 40-50 years.  I want to watch my children grow up, and watch my grandkids be born and need to know I did everything I could at the time to make that happen.  That is what my treatment decision is based on. So - I guess for most of us, treatment decisions vary by individual. ",

On another note, my pathology came back from my re-excision last week and showed 1 mm of additional foci on top of the 7 mm from the lumpectomy that was a surprise.  The Onc recommended a mastectomy at this point.  My breasts are dense.  No one felt the lump to begin with and the mammogram barely picked it up so he thinks there could be more in there.  I'm 37 and this only came to be because I thought I had a clogged milk duct from pumping - I just had a baby.  So now, I am going to go back and read all the posts about bilateral mastectomies and the recovery, what reconstruction is best, etc.  Can anyone here shed some light on the recovery from a bilateral if you had one?  I have a 28 month old and a 3 month old so I am assuming I won't be able to lift them.  Any insight would be appreciated.  I would need to make arrangements for help - hubby works nights and sleeps during the day.  Thanks in advance!",

I had a lumpectomy on 5/27 where the breast surgeon did the SNB.  For me, it did not hurt at all.  They do the painful part after you are under.  They did have to inject 4-5 little shots into my breast when I was awake, but those felt like little pinches - I thought a flu shot was more painful.  I also had a wire insertion - less painful that the original biopsy for me.  What they did was numb the area with cream, then looked at the tumor via ultrasound then inserted a fine wire with a hook at the end into the middle of the tumor.  I'm not sure if they will still do this with a mastectomy though since most of the tissue comes out anyways.  The wire guide tells the surgeon where the tumor is - so when the surgeon goes in he/she just follows along the wire.  There is a thread somewhere on this board called \"Abbreviations for Newbies\"  - I think it is under Waiting for Results. ",
