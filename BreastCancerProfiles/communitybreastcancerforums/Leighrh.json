Stage 2a Doc said 1mm from Stage 1. It does not appear to have spread to any lymph nodes.  Still do not have the pathology of the tumor with the hormone receptors and such.  Go back Wednesday to meet with the surgeon again and hopefully she will have the slides by then.  Also meeting with Plastic Surgeon and the genetics team.  Do not know the after surgery options yet until the pathology comes in but so far on the surgery side my options are: 1.  Lumpectomy with reconstruction and with Radiation 2.  Mastectomy of Rt Breast/ reconstruction 3. Mastectomy of both breast( having the genetic test to see if I have the gene)/ reconstruction I really have no idea which one to do.  I will discuss all options next week. Feeling a little better about it all.  The Docs at MD Anderson are wonderful and this is all they do, so I feel like I am in the best care.  Has anyone every heard of not having to do chemo with this kind of diagnosis?  I know without the hormone receptor test it's impossible to know but I can't help but hope for no chemo. I don't know why but that seems to be the most horrible thing about all of this.   I know I can handle the surgery.  I just really could do with out the chemo  :(  I should just expect the chemo so I won't be disappointed I guess.  I work full time, I have 2 active boys that play travel ball, I love to workout at the gym, I just can't see where chemo fits into all that.  LOL  Plus it's POISON!!! I just can't wrap my brain around it.",

My feeling was because of the node and it being invasive.... there could be a straggler out there somewhere.. Hit it with all ya got! I have not seen MD Anderson go with other chemos besides AC-T for most. I am sure they do, but it seems to be their \"standard of care\". Being younger.... not as young as you :(.... I would still do it.... in my situation.... AC was hard but not near as hard as I imagined. Taxol is better but here at the end it's exhausting!",

When you are young they want to be as aggressive as possible! It's just what they do! I took it.... I am older than you ( 42) but I wanted to throw the sink at it. I want it gone and not to return ever!! Go with your gut though.. trust the MO you are going with. There are lots of side effects of the different chemo cocktails..... but you are young and you will do fine! It's really tough to wrap your brain around chemo and the toxicity of it. But its a cancer killer!!! That's how I try to think about it. And....... There are MANY, MANY, MANY women on here.. Stage I,II,II and IV who have done AC-T..... it's not only for Stage III+....... although I am sure you wrote that in kinda a panicky moment :) ",

I do only skim some of his topics like how bad chemo is for you... since I am doing chemo and don't need to go down the rabbit hole of how horrible it is.. LOL But he does have some great tips for helping your body prevent the cancer from coming back. I absolutely believe that fruits and vegetables and healthy natural eating can play a part in starving off cancer cells. I too unfortunately do not believe that any thing is a \"cure\". My BC experience has opened my eyes to the money machine that cancer is and it has really convinced me that there is no way anyone is really looking for a \"cure\". Sure they are looking for better/easier treatments, but a cure would mean all this money that people pay for treatments would go away. NO ONE at these large multi million dollar Cancer facilities wants to the money to go away.......... sad state but it is what it is,",

I don't know why but the thought of chemo makes this the worst case scenario for me. I am going Wed for surgery follow up and to meet with my MO and I'm sure once I have a def plan I will feel better. Just panicking right now.",
