I did want to ask anyone doing TAC every 3 weeks - is it crazy to think that towards the end of treatment I could take a test, or will my brain be completely fried by then? I am a military reservist, and to get promoted I have to take a series of tests by Jun -- I have 6 left and my thought was that I could sign up to take one the day before each treatment (that would give me maximum healing time). It looks good on paper, but before I commit I was hoping that someone who is farther along than I am on TAC (I've only had 1 treatment) could tell me if the side effects last longer (I know they get cumulatively worse.. I'm just hoping I'll be OK by the 3rd week after each treatment..). Sorry for the long question - I'm just a planner and I need to lay some things out for the next few months... of course, BC does not lend itself well to planning... Thanks! Rachel",

I'm doing \"dense dose TAC\" - anyone else doing that? Would love to hear specifics from someone with same treatment, though I know SEs vary alot person to person. Also, I'm 38 and have 4 kids ages 8, 7, 5, and 1 - I took the 3 older ones with me to a wig shop to help pick out a wig - that seemed to help take the fear out of it a little (they begged me to get a brightly colored one - which I did order on-line for special occasions :). I'm hoping they are still OK when I actually start losing my hair - I have some books ready, but any other advice on how to help them through would be appreciated!  Rachel",

I'm very lucky to have a supportive husband, but with 4 young kids we still have to tag-team even on my worst days just to handle what they need. Part of me wishes I could take a mini-vacation after each treatment to recuperate... of course, then I would miss them terribly and be miserable.... can you tell I'm just rambling??  I am trying to focus on the temporary nature of our current struggle, but my heart breaks when I feel like I'm too tired or grouchy to be the kind of mom I want to be -- and my kids are really too young to understand. Again, my husband is a great dad, but even on his best days he isn't the most patient.  OK - enough feeling sorry for myself - honestly I've been so fortunate that my kids have been rolling with things pretty well - talking about their feelings and their teachers say they are sharing their feelings in school and seem to be doing well with everything. I need to focus on the positive and know that we'll get through it and all be stronger for it...",

This is going to be a crazy ride (already has been, with all the tests and BMX/axillary dissection to date...) and I really love having such a great group to share the ups and downs!! I've been taking notes from all your experiences - which is helping me develop a list of questions to ask when I go to \"chemo class\" next week. I'm hoping by being informed I can do as much as possible to mitigate SEs. rcm - my 5 yr old had a similar reaction to me losing my hair, but he seemed to understand when I explained that it was from strong medicine that was keeping me healthy. Of course, I haven't started to actually lose my hair yet - we'll see if things change. But so far, my kids are able to joke about it - they loved the colorful wig I found on-line for $9.99 (I'll consider that my house hair :).., Rachel",
