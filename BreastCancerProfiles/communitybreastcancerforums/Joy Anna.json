      "Content": "Joy-Anna wrote: Hi Sisters, just a little background about me. I'm 43 and was diagnosed with triple negative stage 3 breast cancer the end of June 2015. A mammogram didn't pick up the cancer, the mammogram came back normal. I found a lump under my right arm which turned out to be cancer. I began chemo the beginning of July and did 16 rounds of chemo which ended the week before Christmas. I am the single parent to a beautiful 12 year old girl who is my everything. January 28th (few weeks ago) I had a double mastectomy and all lymph nodes were removed from under right arm. I had been waiting to hear the results from pathology regarding the tissue that was removed to determine next steps in treatment as well as to see how well the chemo worked. The latter part of last week I was informed by the surgeon that the tissue either never made it to the lab or the lab lost the tissue. He apologized and said this had never happened if his 29 years of experience. I am a very positive person and have fought this cancer bravely and courageously. I have faith in God and pray to him throughout the days. I've tried to keep my tears to the shower so my daughter doesn't see me cry through this. However, this lost tissue has pushed me to a place I was trying never to go to. I'm scared that now I will never know if in really cancer free. Now what?? Just pretend that all is good? I've been assured that the hospital and state will be conducting an investigation. Please sister's, any support would be treasured. I tend to try to deal with things on my own but I really feel like the only ones who can help me right now are you that have breast cancer or have been through it. Please pray for me today I'm really struggling. Love you all xoxo xoxo xoxo. In shock Dx 6/24/2015, IDC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIIA, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Since it's all just happening now, I haven't even talked with my primary oncologist yet. I will contact a lawyer on Monday and follow the advise of all of you. I don't want anyone else to go through this. Someone needs to be held accountable for this \"mistake\". I will continue to pray and get a second opinion. I will also research what additional testing I would benefit from and I will take action. I will not be passive regarding this. I will follow up with you sisters too. Oh how your words comfort me. I'm also researching local support groups. I well keep you posted. I know God has my back too and won't leave me hanging. I just wonder how this could have even happened. It's going to be interesting what their investigation turns up and what they propose to do to \"fix\" it. Additional scans blood work?? I hope an attorney takes my case. Again, thank you for all of your support, I'll keep you all posted. God bless and hugs to you all. Peace xoxo xoxo xoxo",

I contacted a very good attorney in the city where I live and I'm waiting to hear if he'll take my case. I pray that he does. I should know by Wednesday they said. The Administrator of the hospital called me yesterday to apologize. He's doing his job of trying to keep the peace. He said that he would be following up on things and working with the lab etc. Needless to say his words did little to comfort me. He offered to meet with me along with the surgeon and head of the lab. I really would love to have the guidance of a lawyer before I do that. He also offered me a PET scan. I know they just want this to quietly go away, but it's not going to. He said that the lab states that they never got the sample at all. When I questioned him further, he knew nothing and could give me absolutely no answers. I am working with patient advocate from the hospital, who is as kind and helpful as she can be, but has no answers and mainly just apologizes to me. States Attorney General office....good idea. Pray for me please that God guides me in every step and pray that this lawyer takes my case. I don't want anyone else to have to go through this. Someone needs to be held accountable. I'll keep you all posted, my dear sisters. Xoxo",

Around 4:30 this afternoon I received a phone call from one of the best law offices in the city in which I live (the law office I called about the missing tissue sample). They called to tell me that they would be interested in representing me in this case. I feel like God is really got his hands in this. I've prayed and prayed about this and shed a bucket full of tears. I feel like I'm not alone with you, my sisters and now with the support of a legal team. I am so grateful. I meet with my oncologist tomorrow as well as plastic surgeon... It's going to be business as usual follow ups. Im of course not going to say anything about litigation but just see what's the they have to say etc I will then meet with my attorney Friday morning. I will keep u posted my sisters xoxo xoxo xoxo hugs",

A lot has happened regarding my situation and I also had a swim meet to attend for my daughter as well as a hosted a sleep over for she and some friends. I want to just be a mom and give her normal fun childhood joys despite having to manage my pain both physical and mental. By the grace of God we had a wonderful weekend. My oncologist appointment went just as I had imagined it. She assured me of what a good surgeon I had and how bad both he and she felt about what had happened. She wanted to hear my version of what I had been told. I told her that I understood that my tissue had been lost. She nodded yes and then said that she \"felt\" that the cancer was gone and we should be celebrating that right now. She said that we all needed to be optimistic despite what happened and move forward with the already planned 6 rounds of radiation. She thought we could do a PET scan after the radiation which will begin the middle of March. I didn't know what to say and wanted to just hear what she had to say about it all. Especially knowing that I was soon going to speak with a lawyer. It's been very emotional because she had nothing to do with the error and I loved her as my oncologist. I'm torn in many different directions and trying to come to terms with everything. She seems to be on the side of \"let's just move on and assume it's gone\". I did meet with a medical malpractice attorney... One of the biggest firms(if not the biggest and most powerful) in the city in which I live. They want to represent me in this case and feel I have a strong medical malpractice case. I did sign paperwork and retained an attorney. I felt heard and validated by having them take this case. I continue to sift through next steps, day at a time. Prayer, healthy eating, loving my daughter and family and trying to take for granted no moments is how I am carrying on right now. I have alot of pain under my right arm where the lymph nodes were removed so also managing that. I will be getting second opinions as well which will be my next step. I'll keep you sisters posted. Hugs, love and prayers sent your way. Xoxo xoxo xoxo",
