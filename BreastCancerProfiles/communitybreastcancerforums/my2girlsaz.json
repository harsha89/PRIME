    "Content": "Oct 9, 2012 03:18PM - edited Oct 9, 2012 03:25PM by my2girlsaz 2 years ago I was told (in person) I had stage1 BC by my surgeon.  He was kind and reassuring.  I Underwent a lumpectomry and radiation treatment.  My radiation oncologist was GREAT and he reffered me to a Hematology specialist for further treatment.  A recent mamogram showed somthing suspicious in my other breast.  Had a biopsy on a Thursday.  The Doctor said this was different than the last time, instead of a mass it was calcifications and was told the results would be available, probably Monday afternoon.  The Hematologist called me Friday afternoon to tell me the cancer was back, she had already contacted the surgeon and was sorry.  My nerves are shot being left to worry about this the entire weekend.  This was HORRIBLE !!!!  Who does that?  Since the cancer is back I said \"my body is obviously wanting to have cancer.  Can we do additional testing to see what's going on?\"  Her immediate response is that the insurance company probably would not approve it.  Upon my instance, she called and they did approve a Pet Scan.  I'm thinking to look for another doctor.  If anyone lives in the phoenix area and knows of a GREAT Cancer doctor, please let me know....",
