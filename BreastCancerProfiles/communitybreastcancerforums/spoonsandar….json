I had a positive biopsy for ADH in September and I also have an autoimmune disease Takayasu (vasculitis). I was told by my rheums at Duke that I needed to try to limit surgical procedures due to my immunosuppressants and that radiation and tamoxifen would not be options for me if the lesion was DCIS. That is how I came to the decision to do the bil mast. I am 41, had had 2 mammos and had already needed 2 biopsies - and have other mild family history. Overall, they put my lifetime risk around 50% and that along with my issues with the treatment (rads/Tam) if I DID get it, made the decision less difficult. I just started a blog if you find it at all helpful. www.spoonsandarmor.wordpress.com. Best of luck to you.",
