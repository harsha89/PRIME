      "Content": "faithfulheart wrote: Hey Everyone, Well,  I went for my final procedure on my recon today, Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!  It's been 2 years now, nov 13, 2009 that my ps put my expanders in. I had the switch last july to silicone, then lots of rads. 6 months later He formed the nipple on both sides in march, it's just so crazy what they can do these days! I had a pretty tough time healing on my cancer side from all the rads, so after 5 more months of healing,  he finally did the tatooing today!  You know what, it looks so real. I started crying, I felt so dumb, but the dr. said take a look in the mirror. I did and tears just started to roll down my face.  2 years ago this month I was told I had Breast cancer, it was the scariest day of my life. I choose to have a bmx, regardless of recon, I would have done it even if there were no such thing as reconstruction after a bmx!  I just wanted to live. Well I am living, I am raising my kids, one day at a time. Today, for the first time in a very long time, I felt some sort of closer to this nightmare we call bc. I felt like humpty dumpty that fell off the wall,  a real hell of a fall. So all the Dr.s and nurses, family and friends, helped put humpty together again!!!! I know it's cheezy, but you get my point. I just wanted to share this with the strongest women I have ever encountered. I know my journey will continue as yours will too, but each day, is ONE MORE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!! So,  although it was a long road, It's one more thing I can put behind me, thank God!!  I loved my ps, but I am really tired of seeing him!!!  I am not saying recon is for all, and I know that sometimes it's not even an option, we all know our goal is to keep this beast at bay. I just wanted to say that for me, in this world, it was a good day!!!!! Love to all my sister's, Stephanie Log in to post a reply",

I have lost a lot of weight since stopping chemo. kinda of strange considering I had the ooph and I am now on tamoxifen .Oh well I won't complain about that,  it's most likely because I'm afraid to eat anything!   Organic spinich, asparagus, Kale, Berries, berries, and more berries!!!  Fish,hormon free everything.  I am going some where with this I promise. 5000IU-D3 a day and 1200 mg of calcium for bone health. A great one a day supplement, effexor,  for those peskey hot flashes, and lots of Juice plus!  Oh and the Tamox! I want fried calimari, with a nice big steak, a ceasur salad, w/ lots of dressing, and the biggest glass of red wine ever!!!!!!  OK, I will for go the food , if I can just have the wine ! What is ok,  before I was dx,  I really enjoyed my red wine.  Now the occasional glass of wine I have with dinner , or with my husband, I can't seem to even enjoy , for fear that I'm harming my body.   My onc and my bs both told me to drink a glass of wine with dinner, a couple times a week if I want, but why bother if I can't enjoy it. I want to enjoy it without guilt, I feel like I have givin so much up in my life since dx. We deserve some simple pleasures don't we? I don't like sweets, love coffee, not givin that one up! I know a lot of studies show no achohol at all,  but why would my docs say its ok then. This seems trivial I know,  but Gosh darn,  I WANT MY RED WINE!!!!! Guilt free! This is so silly I know ! Its friday,  just thought I would get some feed back on this topic. what do you think?  No stats Please, you will force me to have to drink!!  LOL cheers maybe, Faithful Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "faithfulheart wrote: Hi Sister's, so , I saw my bs today, an awesome DR. and friend. Just a 3 month check up on my breasts. I had an  MRI a few months back, all was well. During my exame she felt a node in my right ax, not the side my cancer was on. I have had a bmx so there's no breast tissue just skin. Since chemo ended I have lost a lot of weight, she feels that might be why she can feel things better now. Well she got her ultrasound out to check it out, she said she could see the node and that it looked pretty normal to her. I FREAKED, do you think it's cancer, she said I don't think it is, however she is sending me to get a diagnostic ultrasound this week to confirm it's nothing. I'm so scared! I just feel like I am finally moving forward, I'm so not ready for any bad news, I just don't think I can deal with this. Has anyone dealt with a swollen node, or had a scare like this. She is also going to ultrasound my cheast wall while i'm there, not that she saw anything there , just as a routine look. Here we go with the waiting game, I hate this it's just so unfair to my family. I need some advice, or words of hope girls, I;m just feeling so scared and angry right now. My bs said to me, this is your life now, things like this are going to pop up and I can't freak out every time. I said to her would you not worry if it were you, she said yes I probebly would. My bs is also a bc survivor, caught it very early, but she gets the fear factor. I don't know what to think. She said we all have nodes, she does not seem overly concerned, but I am extremly concerned. I have never wanted to stay in stage 3 so bad. Please pray for me! I need it !!

In June I had my ooph, then rads then tamoxifen. Since my ooph and tamox, I have developed lots of wierd pains . Now I know at 42 to go into post menapose over night could reek some havoc on my body, that makes since, right?  Well the pain has gotton better all over so now its just right upper leg. Sometimes it will wrap around my side. Comes and goes, but never totally goes away. When I excersise I feel it so I take advil,  and it helps. It really is in an odd place, its like upper leg to the side,  but will sometimes move to my hip area, bare with me please I know I'm rambleing. I have mentioned this to my bs and onc before. They did not seem alarmed at all, said it was not a common place for bone mets, and that if it were mets the pain would get worse and worse, not come and go. My onc does not really trust blood work, tumor markers ect.. However, won't scan if he does not feel its absolutly needed. I really don't want more radiation, I have had so much, but I think I have become completly obsessed with this stupid spot of pain in my leg. I will add it does feel a little better when I really stretch it out. I have an excellent onc, I do love him. The problem is,  Ladies I don't feel strong enough mentally for more bad news right now. I feel like I am finally moving forward, I like my hair,  I feel like everyday I am so grateful to be alive. To be with my kids, and my DH. Sherri, I  know you said to me to xanax up and just do the bone scan,  and get some peace of mind. I can't seem to muster up the strength.  My concern is they will find somthing. I need to decide by tommorow !  Maybe I could try other x-rays to see if anything suspicious shows up, then have a bone scan. I am freaking out here! To be totally honest I am more afraid of getting back in that damm chemo chair then any thing in the world right now. I feel good I just want to live. Tell me this pain is nothing, I don't know what to do!  Love you all, thanks my dear sister\"s HELP!!! Stephanie Log in to post a reply",
