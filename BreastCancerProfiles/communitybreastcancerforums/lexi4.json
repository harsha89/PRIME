Life has been a bit crazy here at home. My dear daddy has been in the hospital for weeks fighting for his life. He has a number of issues going on physically that we are hoping and praying he will recover from. We welcome any and all prayers for healing and recovery for my dear poppa. My kids are great. My DS is graduating HS in 2010. I never thought I'd be here to see this! I am so proud and excited for him. We will be getting college apps filled out here soon. My DD is in 8th grade and is a terrific student and has a great circle of friends. We are so thankful that our kids have survived and thrived through my getting sick. They are sweet compassionate kids. I am in the finishing stages of my foobie recon. I will be having tattoos to finish up the nipp recon. It doesn't make me forget what I went through, but gosh they look really good considering! Nice for wearing clothes and not using the prosthetic foobie. That is it it in a nutshell. I am sad to see new faces in our club all the time. I hope that I can be helpful and encourage others through this horrible experience. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Hugs, Lexi",
