They are like boulders :) Did your PS give you excercises to do?  I thought my range of motion was fine but the therapist moved my arms in certain ways that I had limitations. She said I had functional movement but I could improve in other areas. Always something!  I'm supposed to get my ovaries out soon. Either I'm reading about reconstruction, surgical menopause or LE.  Oh well, one thing at a time or I'll go nuts :)",

I think I am going to get a referral to an LE therapist at the cancer center in my city.  I think it won't hurt to get my arms measured and to just get educated on my risks.  Maybe that will reduce my anxiety a bit.",

I am glad I saw her even thougha sometimes I feel as though it is a bit overkill.  I didn't have radiation.  But I'm only 37 so I feel like I need to be proactive.  A PT friend of mine and someone on the FORCE website mentioned getting evaluated by an LE therapist.",

Since I had SLNB in both arms she said I am low risk for LE (around 4-8%) but it is a lifetime risk.  We talked about things to do to prevent LE like taking the blood pressure on the leg if possible or using the arm with less nodes removed if the leg isn't possible. She said to ask for the smallest needle and the most experienced phlebotomist if I have to do it in my arm.  I can just imagine that would go over well :)  She said even if I don't follow all the recommendations at least I know the risks. It was very informative and at least she has my baseline measurements if something comes up. Thanks cinnamonsmiles for the website reference. Inks, I'm glad you had no problems with LE.  My surgeon said I was low risk and not to do anything different but I'm already a worse case scenario kind of person and wanted to know ways to prevent LE. Thanks for answering my questions. I know I don't have LE but I appreciate your time.",
