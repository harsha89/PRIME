The thing is, more women in the US get mammograms, which can give the appearance that breast CA is more prevalent, but it is actually just that it is more frequently detected. It is really important to remember that a \"cause and effect\" link has to be established, not just a \"correlational\" link. The mantra of good research is \"correlation does not prove causation\". That said, what matters most is what you are comfortable doing, so perhaps a visit to a holistic or organic store might give you more options.",

You have to share this information with your doctors, because they will help you come up with a plan to manage your pain while addressing your previous addiction. Another thing is, are you having immediate reconstruction? From what my surgeons told me, the reconstruction is the more painful part of the process, so you may have some options there as well. Good luck through all of this, and stay strong.",

      "Content": "May 3, 2009 11:58AM emtesla wrote: Otter, you know your imaging! There are a few additional advantages to digital imaging. Skin folds near the axilla can be adjusted for; no more lost films so easier comparison, and a lot of places that use digital imaging are also using CAD (computer aided diagnosis aka Second Sight), which is an additional step that can sometimes help find very subtle abnormalities. But, like you said, a dense breast is a dense breast, and although digital imaging allows the radiologist to better \"window\" the image by making it darker or brighter, it doesn't mean that the breast was better penetrated by the x-ray beam. Eldub, you bring up some great points as well. My only other suggestion is to make sure that any mammograms are done at an ACR (American College of Radiography) accredited site; the techs and equipment have to meet a very high standard, and the radiologists have to read over a certain number of mammograms a year to maintain their proficiency. The important (and frustrating) part is that all of these different modalities show different information. Calcifications show up well on a mammogram, but not so well on a MRI or US. US is great at showing if an area is solid or fluid, and MRI can show if an area enhances with contrast possibly indicating an abnormality, but there is so much information on a MRI that it can sometimes be difficult to say with confidence that an area is benign or suspicious. Sometimes it is only by using multiple modalities that a course of treatment can be decided upon. In the interest of full disclosure, I am an x-ray tech who used to do mammography but now I do MRI.",

It is a shorthand way to describe what the radiologist found on the initial report. What her letter probably says is something like the radiologist found some inconclusive areas and additional imaging is needed. Like everyone has said, 80% of these cases are normal non-cancerous changes in the breast tissue. I know this is scary, but stay positive, okay?",
