The rest of my my chest got feeling back after I healed up. Also got wonderful emotional support on the Facebook group Flat and Fabulous. Wish you the best with your choice. It's very personal.",

We are in the way to my sister in law's house for the fire dinner with the Fam since my diagnosis last Friday. I pretty well knew it was an issue on the 9th when I had th Mammo and it hurt where I had the lump. It's been a roller coaster. I'm holding up well but te sad faces are getting me down. I am a pediatric physical therapist with an over scheduled case load so have been too busy to think except at 3am. My big challenge next week is meeting with coworkers and giving up some work so I can start to take care of myself. Interviewed a surgeon Tues and meeting with another surgeon and PC both on Monday. Went for MRI yesterday in the snowstorm and had to cancel it as th ins goofed and only authorized one boob! Hubby was mad but I am just taking I in stride as in the grand scheme of things it's no biggie MRI for both next Tuesday. All I know so far is ILC small tumor (but painful) low grade, estrogen positive. Don't have HER results yet. Let's keep in touch!",

The BC said a lumpectomy with radiation or UNX would suffice but said he'd defer to my choice. He said the more surgery the more chance of complications.and didn't change my life expectancy. I made my decision getting the IV for my MRI. Decided I wanted it once and done. I have 2 friends that made that choice. A 3rd did not and like me has issues with anxiety. She said she goes crazy with worry every Mammo Did not want the mental anguish and going through possible pain with more MRIs biopsies etc on the good side. Had my surgery Friday and have no regrets. Feeling liberated. On the other hand I'm a wimp and don't like pain so am not going for reconstruction. In my case I am looking forward to getting fitted with some lightweight symmetrical foobs. The choice is so personal. I took a paper and made a line down the middle then made a list of pros and cons of each choice on each side. Prayed about it, slept on it and BMX won for me. Gentle hugs.

The differnece being that the doctor.put a scopolamine patch on me before surgery (sea sickness patch behind the ear) and I was spared the nausea. Plus I have not yet missed my breasts as I was happy to see them go as I was so angry at them for making me sick. Perhaps so am not as far along in the grief process that I don't miss them. Anyhow this isn't about me. just wanted to say I am awake with you. Still waiting on my node report and am consumed with the what might be next. Ijust want to be through all this, Yet perhaps from here on in we will have a different perspective. A friend who went through it 3 years ago says it was the worst and best things that happened. It was painful, the theapy was an ordeal, the hair loss traumatic... She has the what if hanging over her head but she also treasures every day, feels stronger and healthier for making positive healthy lifestyle changes.

When I hug myself with the other hand it feels good. I have been sleeping in a recliner with my arms elevated on pillow so my arm is ok Have tried to wrap it with some compression fabric which seems to make it feel better but now it spills over the top at arm pit. They gave me a surgical bra at the hospital but it's not for compression. It was worthless as it just dug into the incisions Don't have anything to hold up now so what's the point. I'm just wearing a soft cami. The visiting nurse is coming as I had been leaking around the drain site. Just wondered if there were any words of wisdom from you all. SO grateful for how advice had helped me get through the last 2 weeks",

Hopefully it won't have to get drained. The drain site stopped leaking at last! The nurse said things are looking better. The BS will see me tomorrow if it's not better. He called me later today and was most attentive. I've had the best care and feel so much better after the nurse was able to check it out. Back in the recliner for another night with all my pillows. My poor little dog doesn't understand why I'm not in bed with her snuggled by my knees. This BC stuff even stresses our pets",
