After I posted last night I thought I might feel better if I took a nice warm bath.  Well we live out in the country and when it rains for 40days and 40 nights our well gets muddy for a few days.  I know poeple pay a lot of money for a mud bath but with the way my stomach felt I just could not bring myself to get in the tub.  Besides that red clay turns my grey hear and I look like a flamingo for a few days.  So needless to say it was a short shower instead of a long leasurly bath.  Feel a little better today.  Hope everyone is fine, especially my daughter,PauldingMom.  Love ya",

(Ha Ha)!!! Well girls keep your chin's up.  WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS!!! Love you all.",

I was told you could use regular hair spray on my wig.  Just use in lightly.  Do need special shampoo, I was told.  And do not open the oven door with your wig on. I was notified that I was assigned to two angles.  Can't wait to hear from them. Well girls I plan on getting some things done today so I better get busy.  Can't lay around like a couch potatoe forever.  Ha Ha.  Love to all",
