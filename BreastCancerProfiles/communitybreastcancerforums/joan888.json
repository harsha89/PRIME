I will say that I hardly noticed any fatigue at all through my radiation treatment, but I do work from home and that probably made things easier. I also got in my daily walks and played tennis a couple times a week. There were a couple nights during the last week that I went to bed pretty early to hopefully pre-empt the fatigue and maybe that helped also.

I still have my TE's and they haven't changed during radiation.  They already seemed pretty tight before starting radiation.  My PS would have preferred that I did one more expansion before radation but I just didn't have time and felt already expanded beyond what I was planning.  I think I was told a minimum of two months after radiation before I could have the exchange.  I plan to visit my PS in January and get an opinion about any further expansion and exchange timetable.  I was told to expect about a 3-week recuperation after the exchange so I have not figured out when I want to make time for that.  I have a friend who kept her TE's for almost a year after chemo and never even had radiation. Betsy....so sorry about your having to deal with that MRSA infection.  That is just not fair!! Heather...that \"dignity robe\" sounds like a great idea.  I am so thankful to have such wonderful female rad techs.  They have been so compassionate.  The RO is also great and that makes this whole experience much easier.  Several times I have witnessed former patients stopping by the office to say \"hello\" to the staff and get some hugs.  Is this strange?  I did get many referrals for this office before I started.  I guess they were right.",

I completed #18 on friday and have 9 left.  I am now seeing the first of any reaction at all.  It is just a rashy look and alot of new freckles on my upper chest.  My doctor says its the hyperpigmentation and will go back down once I finish the radiation.  Other than that, he says that my skin is holding up very well.  No tightness or anything.  I am feeling very fortunate.  I use alot of that yucky Aquaphor every night and also use that Special Care Cream alot during the day.  The rash is minimal so far and not at all itchy but I have decided to combine some Cortisone 10-Plus with the cream during the day. I didn't think that I was having any fatigue, but then I flew from Chicago to Seattle yesterday.  Stayed up late (Seattle time too) with my daughter and family.  Felt fine when I went to bed, but then slept in til 9am this morning.  OMG!  That is 11am in Chicago.  I think I must have slept 9-10 hours.  That is definitely not me.  We've been out trick or treating in the rain today and will be going all night having dinner at friends, making a big brunch tomorrow morning to host more family and then hopping on a flight back to Chicago in the afternoon.  I bet that I sleep all the way back.  Have to get back home for radiation on Monday.  What a short leash we are all on these days!!  I feel like it is beginning to wind down for me as I am in the single digits now.  Only 9 left.  I really, really hope that my skin does not break down too much more.  I still have my TE's and want to get them swapped out ASAP in the spring. Good luck to everyone in treatment.  Hang in there.",

I have been using the BOOST hair products and just got the biotin serum which I have been rubbing on my head twice a day.  My husband told me yesterday that he is surprised how fast my hair seems to be growing right now so maybe it is helping.  Then again, maybe it is just time that it would start growing faster anyway. Our son's wedding is Dec 11th and I do plan to wear my wig for that!",
