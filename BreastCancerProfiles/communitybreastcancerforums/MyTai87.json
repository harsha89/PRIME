Dx : Invasive Ductal Stage 2-Tumor 2.8 cm, My sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive. I would not have had chemo or radiation but the nodes is what made the onc recommend the treatment. I had a mamoprint done and it came back low for reoccurance my genetic testing on 21 different genes including BRAC1,2 came back all negative. I will have a lumpectomy November 02, 2015. I came thru very well, blood levels remained perfect, except the dryness of skin, edema in ankles feet, lost all my hair with 80% falling out about 14 days after 1st treatment, eyebrows still intact, lashes sparse, and now my nails look bad with places under the nail bed, with one feeling like it might fall off.. I noticed that after this last treatment my face, especially my chin, mouth weith dfeep wrinkles like that of an aged smoker this time and I did not have this 2 weeks ago! I am hoping it doesnt last. My face was red as usual but did not have this until now! nothing covers it up.",
