      "Content": "MissMyrtle wrote: After surgery and receipt of the Oncotype results my oncologist recomended no chemo, a course of radiation and an armoatase inhibitor. i felt blessed. I was also relieved that the uncertainty was over. I was wrong. Last week I got a bone density test, a baseline prior to beginning the aromatase inhibitor soon after radiation is done. I didn't think much about it. They called me 2 days ago to tell me that the bone density showed a pattern suggesting metastatic disease. They said that the bone density test was not suitable for diagnosis of metastatic cancer so I need to go for a PET scan. I have to hang on until next week: test Monday morning, results on Tuesday. I haven't told my family because it is so uncertain, so strange. The PET will be definative. Log in to post a reply",
