After being on antibiotics for 7 days the issue was still there. My doctor ordered a mammo again this time. Radiology said I'm really too young for the radiation from a mammo. Well I'm going in for one tomorrow. Have you had any news since your last post",

I live in a small town so I think some have that mentality that \"you're too young so it can't be cancer\". I'm not saying it is but honestly, any diagnosis of what's wrong with my left breast would make me feel better. After today's mammo if I don't feel reassured I'm going to check out a second opinion and push for a biopsy. Thank you so much",

He said it doesn't feel bad but he ordered a diagnostic mammo and that happens this upcoming Tuesday. Still have some sharp mild pains in the breast and under my left arm. Hoping just a stubborn infection I suppose. Trying to keep things updated on here.",

Before my last period I discovered a small lump at 3 or 4 o'clock in my left breast. My doctor checked it out and said it may a clogged duct (my youngest is 9 years so not breast feeding related) or period related. So I waited until after my cycle to see what the deal was. My period ended last Thursday. The lump seemed to go away but then on Friday something new came up. In the same area I found a lump redness showed up and I now have a lump in my left armpit. It could be a lymph node. I've had pain and aching since I discovered it. I waited the weekend out to see if it would go away. Still there on Monday so I gave a ring to my doctor and on December 3 I have a diagnostic mammo and an ultrasound. Whatever these symptoms are, they confuse me too. Being our age if this is \"normal\" we sure haven't experienced it before to know what \"normal\" is. Not to mention that we are young and sometimes medical professionals and even ourselves may think we need to ignore it. We're too young for serious issues. I begin to think like that and then I'm glad I'm getting it checked. I'd rather be told it's nothing than to wait longer and find out I should've checked it out earlier. Hang in there!!",
