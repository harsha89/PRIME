Anyhow, my doctor thinks it is a fibroademnoma, but she did say she can't say she is \"100\" percent until she runs the tests.  I should hear from her in a few days to make an appointment to talk results. I have read that fibroadenomas do increase the chance of breast cancer in the future.  I already know that even if it is benign, I have to continue monitoring my breasts with regular ultrasounds because yesterday my doctor found another lump starting (might just be dense breast tissue, though, b/c it is so small). I've been reading about this stuff - yup, I'm one of those that just searches for as much info I can get my paws on- and I don't feel that I meet the symptoms of a fibroadenoma.  My pain is not associated at all with my cycle, and I could never move the lump.  Hmmm.  I just don't know.  Just waiting and praying now.  Log in to post a reply",
