A mammogram showed a 9mm nodule at 1 o'clock, however during my ultrasound the Tech stated that she could not find the nodule and called in the Doctor whom also stated that she could not see anything, she then told me \"we will do a repeat mammogram in 6months\". I do not understand why my breast could be so swollen, yet be told to come back in 6 months. At any rate, I notified my PCP of what was going on and she referred me to a breast surgeon. I saw the surgeon on 5/11, after my physical exam she stated that my left breast had thickening and she was concerned so she ordered a Breast MRI. My question is, why is it taking so long for a prior auth for the MRI. When I read my chart online it said \"concerned about Lobular Carcinoma\". Every time I look at my breast, I cry because it looks so different, yet I am still waiting for a prior auth. Any information or recommendations will be greatly appreciated.

My MRI was declined by my insurance company, however with help from my Breast Specialist I will be having my MRI June 29th. I also have an appt. to see my breast specialist that day as my 2nd US(6/5) showed swollen lymph nodes in my armpit and breast which are now painful. I will keep you updated. I cannot thank you enough for your encouragement, I needed it. I do not want to cry anymore, I am going to push till I get answers.",
