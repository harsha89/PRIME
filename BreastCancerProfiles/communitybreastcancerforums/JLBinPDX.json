I was even thinking a Handicap placard during chemo would be justified for a lot of people. I tend to walk but something like that could really help a lot of people out and make day-to-day life just a bit easier. You have me wondering now--hmmm, when/where might I be able to use this.",

I start chemo in four days so it's looking like I'll lose my hair in 3-4 weeks. I'm kind of think that I should go shorter--as a next step--and do some major, fun highlights until it all falls out. I don't color my hair nor have ever paid much attention to it as it's just easy and natural. Good idea or no?",

My second AC chemo is Wed and likely will lose my hair right after that. I have caps ready but no plans for a wig. I'm probably going to be okay with bald most of the time. My daughter wanted me to do the wig things as \"there are so many cute, cool wigs out there now.\" Well, I just learned that insurance pays for one wig (not sure of any limitations yet). God, who knew!? Only yesterday was I able to face my bill/insurance issues and came across this. I'm going to do that now. My daughter then said, \"you can get a wig that looks like your own hair.\" Why the hell would I do that!? Nope, I'm doing something different and fun and that I'd never do to my own hair.",

      "Content": "Apr 23, 2017 07:02PM - edited Apr 23, 2017 07:09PM by JLBinPDX Coach Vickey, if by \"gel caps\" you mean the freeze things used during chemo to try to retain at least some of your hair, that's not for me. I briefly looked into that and quickly decided the hassle, having to have someone there repacking, and possible high expense were not worth it to me. I don't even have anyone drive me to or from chemo so asking someone to do all that work during chemo is just not my thing. My friend says I'll be a hot Sinead O'Conner and I'm going to see how I am about that. It's coming, likely, in just a few days. I live in Portland, Oregon anyway so looking a little different is pretty normal. Mislill, a wig just sounded like too much trouble to me, but the insurance coverage probably will push me into one at least. And my daughter really wants to be a part of it so that just seems like an okay thing. I have basic, mousy brown hair so I'm thinking a few shades lighter, brighter, happier. I'm kinda excited a bit now.",
