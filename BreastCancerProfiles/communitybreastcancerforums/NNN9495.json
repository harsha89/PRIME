I had a BIRAD-4 mammogram (left side) in 4/08 and had a sterotactic biopsy performed on June 3 and the calicifications in question were benign. The difficult part was the wait to get my appointment with the breast surgeon after my abnormal mammogram and then the wait to get the biopsy done. I had moments of absolute craziness - the thoughts of \"what if\" kept creeping in at inopportune moments. Donna, I'm hoping for the best for you and hang in there! Thinking good thoughts for a benign outcome.",
