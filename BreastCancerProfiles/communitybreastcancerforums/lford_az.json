I was diagnosed 2 weeks ago after an annual 3D mammogram & MRI Mammogram: stage 1, grade 1. I've been \"interviewing\" (let's just call it what it is) surgeons & oncologists. I'm considering the Biozorb. I see a post from Virgina123 on 2/15/16 regarding her biozorb experience (pain) but no updates. Does anyone else have pros/cons regarding the biozorb? I understand that, with the Biozorb, I will have to do traditional, 6-week radiation versus the 5-day accelerated partial breast radiation. Also wondering about the pros & cons of the 5-day vs the traditional radiation. Hugs & best wishes to everyone going through this. I'm naturally a bit of a Pollyanna & have already kicked the shit out of thyroid cancer, so am not too freaked about this. Still, I want to make smart decisions. Thank you in advance for your feedback.",
