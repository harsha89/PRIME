I went for a follow up and referral at my primary late yesterday afternoon and received a copy of my pathology report that was sent over from the radiologist who reviewed my initial mammo & ultrasound and also did my core biopsy. I have a few questions, although I'm meeting with my new oncologist first thing in the morning, I'm more than a bit freaked out at some things that were mentioned on my path report.  A quick bit about me and my symptoms so far: - 36 years old, no kids, no family history of BC.  - Lump at 9:30 on right breast, 8 cm from nipple - found about 2 months ago, but passed off as a cyst initially.  - Nipple leaking serous yellow fluid from one duct. This is what prompted the doc visit (leaking has since stopped about 3 days after biopsy) - Slight swelling of breast for past 1-2 months. The right one has always been bigger, but it's a tad bigger than normal. Bra is tighter on that breast and leaves marks - Enlarged axilla nodes seen on ultrasound, but were not biopsied at time of core biopsy. They are not palpable, but area is sore from time to time.  - Bruising from biopsy/tumor area - now a patch of pinkish/red at tumor/needle site (am 8 days post biopsy) - Slight thickening of skin on breast, and under areola I understand everything on my path report (been lurking here and googling for the last 2 weeks!). But the one comment that is giving me a amajor scare is that under Assessment/Recommendation it says \" additionally, there is diffuse parenchymal edema and skin thickening in the right breast, which raises the possibility of inflammatory carcinoma, but could be secondary to right axillary lymphatic obstruction as well\" I have no peau d'orange, but the general slight swelling of my breast, and redness at the tumor/biopsy site are giving me major pause. There is no redness or pink area anywhere else in the breast. The biopsy area is putting out a bit of warmth, but the rest of the breast is not warm to the touch. I have no dimpling or defined ridging, but I do have what look like a few small stretch marks from the swelling near the biopsy site, but they are only visible when raising my arm.   Like I mentioned, I have an appt with my new oncologist first thing in the morning. I was just hoping to get some opinions from others that might have had the same type of slight symptoms present and were NOT told it was IBC. My mind is in overdrive right now, and I went from \"I can handle IDC,\" to \"holy s***, it could be IBC\". Please talk to me and calm me down! :)  Dx 6/10/2014, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 1/6 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2- Chemotherapy 6/18/2014 AC + T (Taxol) Surgery 10/16/2014 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Underarm/Axillary Radiation Therapy 11/30/2014 Breast, Lymph nodes Dx 12/15/2014, IDC, Stage IV, mets Chemotherapy 12/15/2014 Methotrexate (Amethopterin, Mexate, Folex) Log in to post a reply",

I had my port implanted yesterday and am a little sore today, but otherwise fine. I hope this is a good sign of how all the other treatments and surgeries are going to go.  MO says he would classify it as IBC, due to the slight skin involvement, and even though the redness appeared after the biopsy. The surgeon said he wasn't going to call it IBC, but rather IDC with skin involvement. It's really just semantics at this point. Either way, I'm being considered as Stage IIIB, and they're doing the same round of treatment they would since I'm a big fat Triple Neg, as if the IBC was part of it or not.  I have chemo class on Monday, a PET scan on Tuesday, another appoint with more imaging on Wed (since all my images were outside the hospital network they want to do their own) and then I start dose dense chemo on Thursday. 4 x AC, followed by 4 x Taxol. After that, both docs are recommending MX and are highly suggestive of bilateral due to my young age and aggressive cancer.  Thanks to you wonderful group of ladies and my research from lurking here the last 2-3 weeks, my onc said that I was the first person he's seen that had so much knowledge about what was going on and what was going to happen. He was impressed and asked where in the world did I learn about all these things? :) I'm now wondering just how much, if anything, I'll learn at chemo class that I don't already know. LOL.  Trying to stay positive and know that I will get through this. I did have a mini breakdown when I was told that I wasn't going to be able to go the lumpectomy route. I did have blood drawn for BRACCA, so depending on that result my ovaries are up in the air, too. I think my exact words were, \"I'm going to loose my hair, my boobs, and possibly my ovaries??? I'm going to be a boy!!!\" I can laugh about that today, but that's when it all kind of hit me at once. I knew things were going to start moving fast, I just didn't know how fast! ",

      "Content": "Jun 18, 2014 01:30AM - edited Jun 18, 2014 01:31AM by KimmyD78 Kelly, I'm so sorry. I was in your shoes literally last week. Just diagnosed myself, not quite 2 months after I turned 36.  It's great, albeit scary I know, that the onc wants to see you so quickly. I got the phone call Tuesday morning. Saw my primary later that afternoon for a referral, and had an 8 am appointment on Thursday.  I thought my first appt with the onc was going to be a standard one, maybe lasting an hour or so. The reality was I didn't get home until after 3pm, because they bounced me from the onc's office, to a surgeon, to pre-op at the hospital for a port placement the next morning. Additionally, both docs filled up my calendar this week with other appointments and tests that are necessary before I start chemo in 2 days.  I'm not telling you this to scare you, but rather prepare you for the fact that there is a chance this may all move extremely quickly for you. I knew it would move quick, but I had no idea it would be THIS quick. As nutty as the last five days have been since that first meeting with my oncologist, it's much better for my mental health knowing that there is a treatment plan in place and that we're moving along. It definitely beats the week of not knowing as we endured waiting for the biopsy results. Good luck and let us know how it your appointment goes!",
