She spooked, yanked the fence into me, and dragged me until the fence jammed. I remember nothing. I just woke up at the horses' feet and sore where the metal bars had hit my head and ribs. Then over the next week, the headaches got worse until I ended up in the hospital and they found my brain met. My MO believes the blow combined with the tumor to trigger the swelling, so I can say the horse saved my life by finding the tumor. But truly, getting knocked cold like on TV, I felt nothing -- no fear, no pain, nothing. That day, I had no idea that I was heading for MBC. Now, I get to worry about my kids as MBC does its dirty work. I am glad to still be here with them, and happy they did not find me dead in the paddock, but suersis hit the nail on the head -- going quickly doing something we love is awful for our loved ones but easier for us.",
