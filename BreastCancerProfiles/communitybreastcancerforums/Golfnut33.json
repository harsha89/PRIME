I will write down some questions to make sure I ask what I want to know. Biopsy will be done at Oakville trafalgar hospital but I have no idea what kind of biopsy. Anyway thankfully only 1 more day until biopsy then no doubt another wait for results via Doctor",

Cancer centre is 1 hours drive away so called before leaving to check that on time -all was good but when I arrived there was a 90 minute delay! Was also given a schedule for next week but 5 out of 7 times were way outside of the ranges I gave. Radiologist said to just come when I could but that doesn't feel right and am sure receptionists won't agree ... On the verge of refusing further treatment as I don't see who would have the time to waste 4+ hours a day on it - when exactly can I work? On top of that a headache all afternoon and feel very hot",

Last mammogram 2015 which required a fine needle biopsy for a cyst. Got an urgent phone call from my doctor on Tuesday to come in that day to see her. All she told me was that concentrated calcifications were found so she had booked my biopsy for Tuesday and sent a referral to a breast surgeon for me. Haven't seen any reports but compared to last experience this all seems a lot more serious. Can I ask at biopsy for more information? Will they give it to me? Am trying to stay calm over the weekend but this seems an unusually cruel way of dealing with people! I have apparently very dense breasts so I am assuming that makes it all harder. I am in Ontario Canada so undoubtedly that makes the whole thing more complex .... Dx 4/2018, LCIS/DCIS, Right, 6cm+, Stage 0, Grade 3 Log in to post a reply",

So to update, I got to hospital to be advised my biopsy was cancelled as the incorrect kind was booked (biopsy with us when I needed a stereotactic). This has now been booked for April 11 with a follow up with breast surgeon on April 23. I did however manage to get a copy of my mammogram and ultrasound report which notes 'on mammogram the breast parenchyma is dense. In the upper right breast there are calcification a of indeterminate appearance which are oriented in the linear distribution' BIRAD4 was assigned. So luckily it is not a birad5 but such a pain having to wait so long now",
