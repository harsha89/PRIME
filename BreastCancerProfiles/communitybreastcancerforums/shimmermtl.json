I, too, am aware like never before that October is Breast Cancer Awareness month... or at least I thought I was (btw - October used to be mean \"birthday month\" to me) So, I never (or hardly ever) wear pink - and I wore pink yesterday (Oct 1). Ugh - I must have been possessed! Bonnie",

I see you've been scheduled for a lumpectomy on the 28th - I truly do hope that the BS is right and that the results of this procedure will put an end to the struggle you've lived through these last 5-6 weeks. As for your friend - I'm sorry this has happened and that it's added more stress/upset in your life. I can only suggest that, much like what you've had to do with the waiting game, you need to put your focus elsewhere when faced with the off-putting behavior of a friend. This is her drama - not yours! Bonnie",
