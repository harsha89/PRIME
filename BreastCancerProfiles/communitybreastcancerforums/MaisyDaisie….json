I'm 8/33 and just starting to feel SEs, mostly big fatigue and some swelling. Jayjayc, I had some trouble touching my lumpectomy and SNB scars too at first, but since I've been putting on the moisturizing cream every day, the scars feel softer and not as different as they had been. Can anyone recommend a good source for reading about Grays? I read so much and asked tons of questions at every other part of this journey, but this thread is the first place I've heard about Grays.",
