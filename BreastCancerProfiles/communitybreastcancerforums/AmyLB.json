Anyway, thanks again for being out there. Your stories are inspiring!",

So right now, my big fear is the PET scan.  I believe if it doesn't show spread that I will really be ok.  But I will be stressing so much until they tell me.  It is scheduled for Friday. Someone on here commented to me about becoming hyper sensitive to your body.  That is killing me!  I am fighting with myself everyday, trying to convince myself that every ache and pain is not really the cancer spreading.  As of today \"the bad voice\" as I call it, is trying to convince me that the cancer has spread to my liver and kidney...simply because of perceived aches on my right side.  Nevermind that my period is coming this week, and nevermind that the doctor palpated my liver yesterday and didn't say anything about it being enlarged or anything. UGH!!!  It's just so hard to be rational!

This is going to sound so stupid and superficial compared to what I will go thru and what all of you HAVE gone thru, so I'm sorry, but...that was awful.  I went by myself.  Which only doesn't make sense if you are crazy like me.  I thought I was having the test that didn't require an IV.  Dumb as it sounds, I am phobic about IVs.  I don't know why.  There is no rational reason.  So (and I warned her first that it would happen), I'm sitting there crying like a baby as she is giving me the stupid thing.  I calm down from that and settle in for my 45 minute wait and to sip my discusting berry \"smoothie.\"  When time is up they take me to the scanning room and I must have gone pale white and looked as panicked as I felt.  The guy in there...think he was maybe a doctor...noticed and commented, but didn't really care.  It was a TUBE!!!  I was so happy to NOT be getting an MRI because I knew I could not tolerate being placed in a tube.  But this thing was a tube too!!!  I knew some part of a machine would be passing over me, but I didn't know it was going to be a tube.  Are you catching on that I'm ever so slightly clausterphobic?  Dr. Jerk told me to shut my eyes and I wouldn't know I was in a tube.  It took every ounce of strength in me to get in and stay in that thing.  I wanted to scream \"get me out!\"  They had warned me that the contrast would make me feel hot, so I knew it was coming, but between my panic attack...breathing heavy and heart pounding...when that sensation hit me, I literally thought I was going to die.  Not to mention just the concept of what I was doing there.  I have cancer.  They are looking to see if I have even more cancer than we think.  I was crying and could NOT stop shaking.  But I'm not supposed to move, so I'm trying to not cry hard enough to sob and I'm trying to force myself to stop shaking.  After an eternity it was over, and they are just like...bye.  I cried the whole way home, still shaking and crawled into bed for 2 hours.  I can't even be around people for 5 hours because I'm radioactive. I am just hoping and praying and praying and hoping that they say...nothing new...just the right breast and lymph nodes.  Now let's do this!!!! Amy sorry to be such a whiner...",

      "Content": "AmyLB wrote: Hi everyone.  I'm just moving over here from the \"waiting for test results\" board.  I just found out Monday that I have breast cancer.  All I know right now is that I have 3 or 4 small masses in my right breast (2 were biopsied) and lymph node involvement (one was biopsied).  The surgeon plans to remove my right breast, but wants me to see the oncologist first because he believes they may want to do chemo before surgery. They are also running the genetic marker test and if that is positive, he wants to remove the left breast as well, just to be safe.  My first appointment with the oncologist is tomorrow. I've read through some of the posts here and I am jealous of how level headed everyone sounds.  I am a blubbering mess!  I'm 35.  I have 3 small children.  There is NO history of any cancer in my family at all.  I just found a lump doing a self exam and everything has been a whirlwind since.  I have no idea what is going to happen or what to expect.  I'm still too scared to even look at the diagnostic sheet the doctor gave me.  I know there is more information on it than he told me, but I don't feel ready to handle whatever it says just yet. I just feel very lost and scared. Can anyone tell me what I can possibly expect tomorrow? And in the immediate future? More tests? Jump right into chemo? How often do they do chemo? How bad is it, really? I keep telling myself I can do this. That I know I'm going to be ok! But that I also know the next several months are going to absolutely suck. Amy Log in to post a reply",
