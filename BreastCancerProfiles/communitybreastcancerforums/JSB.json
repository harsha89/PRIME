I asked my doctor about  a ovary suppression shot due to research article I found from Austria that showed a lower recurrance rate when the period was suppressed with chemo vs. those whose periods were not suppressed during chemo. My doctor said said no to the shot. He said our original decision to remove ovaries after my bilateral mastectomy would be find. I'm still not happy with estrogen circulating around the body and not happy with my doctors response. I would appreciate any thoughts on this subject.
