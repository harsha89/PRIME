I am really, really, worried. He said \"I would bet the farm that it is not cancer\". However, we thought it might be over an existing scar? I think that is not the case. I go for a mammogram and ultrasound on Friday, and I am really freaking out. I am really scared it is breast cancer and already thinking the worst. HELP!!!!! Log in to post a reply",
