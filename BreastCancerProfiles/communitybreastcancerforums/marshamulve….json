My initial treatment was a weekly combination of Taxol, Herceptin, (and Zometa  once every four weeks).  After 10 straight weeks, we stopped the Taxol.  I've now had 12 weeks of Herceptin (+Zometa).  My scans are showing significant improvement (shrinkage) everywhere, with the spots in the bones stable.  If I can continue to enjoy life I'll gladly accept the regimen the doctors set forth for me.  Someday, I may not be able to fight, so as long as I'm able, I will. Best wishes to all.    MM   ",
