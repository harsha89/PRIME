I was under anaesthesia for 5 hours. I am still very tired from the op and feeling quite spacey. Is this normal? I am assuming that my body is doing all it can to heal after a long operation but would love to know more about how long it has taken people to feel 'normal' again. I am off strong pain meds and just taking paracetemol now. I have quite a bit of bruising and am still quite numb under my arm. Not seeing surgeon again until 7th of Jan. Chemo later next month after first meeting with oncologist on the 9th of Jan. Of course I am now paranoid that the tiredness is from the cancer rather than the op so would very much appreciate hearing that this lethargy is OK. I suspect I may also still be in a bit of shock as the BC news is still only 4 weeks old. Also, my nipple is quite chafed and weeping a little from the chafing. The nurse says wounds are all healing well and that this is excoriation from the nipple being damp and covered up and will heal in time. Did anyone else get this? So many questions. What fun!

I am resting when I can (a nanna nap most afternoons) and eating really well so hope the days before chemo starts fill me with lots of energy - I'm going to need it! ",

Will have to work out how to get that to tag to tell people what type at the bottom of my posts! Found it myself after weaning my daughter. I used to call it my dud breast feeding boob as it never worked as well as the other (now I know why!)  Scarily the surgeon thinks it could have been in me for a year!   Thanks so much for the speedy reply.  Will wait for someone to chime in re extranodal spread.  I have had CT scans, bone scans and MRI on other breast. All clear at this stage. Only one not done was brain CT.  Surgeon says brain mets usually come after others.  Of course every pain I have now, I am convinced is cancer! I figure I will be a worry wart for a while but am trying meditation and other relaxation techniques to help. Will also try the forum \u2013 thanks for the tips. So glad you are hanging in there.

I chose mastectomy over lumpectomy purely due to a family history of BC and am glad I did. It also meant I could keep my skin and own nipple due to the placement of the tumour. I have decided to have my other breast off and reconstructed once chemo is over when I have the right reconstructed. I have a very strong family history of BC and am waiting on gene testing results. My aunt had it return in her other breast. I think I will feel better once the other has been removed. Interestingly I spoke to my breast surgeon yesterday and he said that extranodal spread is quite common which surprised me. He assured me they got clear margins on the node and that the risk of recurrence is only marginally increased with extranodal spread and not to get too preoccupied with it. He didn't even factor it in to my long term prognosis. I met with my oncologist today who explained that spread increases you chances of recurrence slightly but was very keen to assure me that the fact that I am ER+ is a good thing and that I am still an early BC patient with under 3 nodes affected. I feel much more optimistic about the future now. It's a crappy old road on this cancer journey isn't it? I am trying to avoid Dr Google too much after initially going overboard on it. You're right - every new piece of news adds a curve ball to the mix and prompts some more self internet diagnosis and fear. Living with the fear of this disease will be a lifelong thing methinks. Good luck with your chemo and the mastectomy. I will be thinking of you and will look for your post too. J",

      "Content": "Jubby wrote: Hi All, I am hoping someone can tell me what extranodal spread is?  I had a mastectomy (right side only with a temporary tissue expander before reconstrcution after chemo) on 14 Dec and nodes removed. My right breast was a mess and I thank my lucky stars that I opted for the mastectomy rather than lumpectomy as in addition to an invasive tumour (17mm), I also had adjacent DCIS (40mm) which wasn\u2019t picked up on MRI.   They found 2 sentinel nodes (1 positive with the site of largest focus being 8mm and extranodal spread of 3mm, and the other clear).  15 axillary nodes were identified and clear. My question is what is extranodal spread?  As I have had my head spinning, I didn\u2019t think to ask the surgeon at the time and my follow up with him is not until the new year. I was devastated to learn that it had gone to the sentinel node as all ultrasounds looked clear before surgery.  Add the DCIS and the extranodal spread to the mix and quite frankly I am pooing my pants and thinking the worst. I have been told I am T1, N1, M0. My tumour is ER 3+ (90%), PR 3+, HER2 - Has anyone else had extranodal spread who can explain what this means?  I am wondering if it worsens my prognosis?  It has not been 4 weeks since my diagnosis so my head is spinning and I am trying to keep a check on my negative thoughts until I meet the oncologist on 9 Jan. Chemo will be a definite.  I would love to hear any long term success stories from node positive women.  I have 2 small kids (14 months & 4.5) and am holding it together over Christmas but frankly feeling terrified and worried this could be my last with them even though logically this is unlikely. Any extra explanation about the extranodal spread would be helpful and some success stories would also be received well Many thanks, Jubby Dx 11/30/2012, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, 1/17 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 12/13/2012 Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 1/23/2013 Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Ellence (epirubicin), Fluorouracil (5-fluorouracil, 5-FU, Adrucil), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 8/22/2013 Prophylactic mastectomy: Left; Reconstruction (left): SIEA flap; Reconstruction (right): SIEA flap Log in to post a reply",

Would appreciate any feedback (so I can worry myself even more senseless until the appointment with my Onc on the 9th Jan!). Many thanks!",
