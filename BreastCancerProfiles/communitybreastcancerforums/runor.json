Hub worked an average of 55 - 70 hours a week for all those years. Not because he had to, because he wanted to. I was, effectively, a single parent. Daughter and I did everything together. Went everywhere together. Used to drive through the rural back roads looking for old trucks and horses. I was at every event of her life. Our homeschooling did not keep us tied to the table doing book learning 5 days a week. We were very fluid and flexible and moved as the spirit told us. Because she didn't have to get up to go to school in the morning, there were many late winter nights, so cold and crystal clear, that we used to haul out the toboggans and go sliding through the snow, under the stars, laughing like fools. When she got her own license, truck and then moved out, I was ready for her to go, encouraged her to go. In fact we were clashing so bad one of us had to go! But I crashed all the same. It hurt so bad some days I could hardly breathe. I would sit in this still, quiet, empty house and pray that my heart would stop. Just stop. Just stop beating. I truly felt that I had lived long enough and did not, at this point, need nor deserve to hurt so bad. I take huge offense when people sweep the leaving of children under the rug as a minor life blip and tell parents (often moms) to get up and get on with life. Have you seen what happens to a man who invests his life in his job and then suddenly loses that job? That is a crisis !! But when a mother is suddenly faced with the unjobbing of her life and left in an 'empty nest' (that term makes me gag) it is often glossed over and the insensitive question of :what are you going to do now? gets blared in your face. Usually followed by lots of happy, upbeat suggestions and oh, having given your life and time over to the citizens you've just raised and invested in, step right into fulltime employment so you can give over even more of your time and energy to someone else's cause and don't miss a beat acting like kids leaving is a big deal, cause it isn't. Well yes it is! Blainejennie, this is a big kick in a mom's solar plexus. Go ahead and feel lousy and DO NOT tell yourself to gloss over it by getting on with your life. It can be a horrible, painful time. It brings to light many things, not all of them good, like maybe your spouse has chosen to NOT be a companion in any way and you never realized how he ducked out of that obligation and responsibility - yet we reward and praise men who work in excess. We feel bad for them when they lose those jobs, those objects of their focus and desire. But when mom's are left behind as kids fly off... hey, what job are you going to do now, you old work horse you? I cannot even imagine how much worse this is compounded with a cancer diagnosis. You are torn knowing your kids need to go and knowing that your time with them may be limited. I do not envy you. This has got to be indescribable. I am very, very sorry that you are in this situation. But do not belittle the pain of that empty place that is left when our children leave us. Things will never be the same again. Mourn. It is appropriate.",

About 6 weeks after last radiation I got this throat tickle and the need to cough one, dry, pointless cough. Hack. Nothing wet or fuzzy. Just a tickle deep in the hollow of my throat and then bark, a dry cough. I pointed this out to the radiation oncologist at my follow up visit and she said this is typical anywhere from 6 weeks to 8 months after radiation. Well, that's just peachy. Typical does not cure it, make it more tolerable and has not made it go away. In fact, after almost 3 weeks of coughing, it's getting worse. At first it was just a cough but now I feel all over, generally lousy. My energy was coming back, I thought I was doing fairly well with recovery and now I just want to lay down and not move. Blah, slow, uninterested. Everything seems just ... too ... hard. I do not have trouble breathing, although my lungs do now feel congested where in the beginning they did not. I just don't have any energy. But I am able to totally fill my lungs with air (followed by coughing!). Is anyone else experiencing this post radiation cough, how long did it last, did it kick the legs out from under you? MeToo14, I sometimes feel like I can't catch my breath but that has more to do with my heart. I have a condition called PVC and my heart beats fast, hard, then skips a beat or two. Very annoying! When it's in that flutter / fast mode, it feels like I cannot get enough air in my lungs. It only ever lasts a few seconds but the overall effect is that I begin to feel like I am passing out. Never have. Just feel like I'm going to. If you are having continued feelings of not enough air, maybe have your heart checked. It might not be a lung problem at all.",

Time and again I have to go back to the floor exercises, flat on my back, as being the most helpful so far. Despite all the stretching and what-not I do standing up, none of it has the same impact as laying on the floor and putting my arms straight out to my sides, or up above my head and feeling that incredible pull. I do NOT feel that pull doing the same thing standing up. I encourage all LE sufferers, even if you think you have good range of motion, lay flat on your back and just spread your arms out to the side, or up above your head, or cross each over your body in turn. Keep your shoulder blades flat on the floor, let your shoulders relax into gravity. Even that can produce a stretch where you didn't know you needed it. These exercises have, for me, 95% cleared up the armpit, side and rib swelling. My arm swelling is very reduced. The only thing that has not been improved by these floor exercises is my breast, which is still very swollen each night and hurts every morning. But I am trying some techniques for that too and if I find anything that works, I will share. I am a slow learner but am catching on that this is a forever thing. If I don't keep up these exercises, I pay for it. There is no slacking off. Good luck everyone!",

Basically, that's what I do on the living room floor. Flat on back, arms out to sides and feel that stretch. Change the position of your arms so they form a T or up higher so they form a Y. THey are laying flat on the floor. Your shoulder blades are touching the floor. Then if you want to slide your feet up so your knees are bent and drop both your knees over to one side, then the other, this increases the stretching effect on contracted tissue EXPONENTIALLY! I have never posted a pic here. Not sure how to do it. But you're right, pics would help. I am not sure what muscles I feel the pull in (since I do not know the names of my muscles, shameful) but I feel it very much in the affected breast itself! OUCH!

TaRenee, I think I do get what you're talking about. I do something similar in a standing position, had not tried it laying down. But I was shocked and amazed at how moves I do easily standing up were so much more difficult laying down! Obviously there was a whole other set of muscles (?) that weren't getting worked out. It's like it opened up drainage pathways for me that had been blocked off. Cooked shut with radiation. Too bad I haven't found the secret to boob fluid yet. Working on it.... Boob fluid.

The skin has that weird orange peel look to it because it is all plumped up with fluid. I massage my boob at night, following instructions I've seen on different videos. Makes no difference. The exercises that helped very much with the other fluid swelling have NOT helped boob or arm. Tight compression tops have been suggested for night to help the swelling. But with the hot flashes I get from the tamoxifen the thought of having anything tight on is terrible! As it is I hurl off the blankets, whip my t-shirt up and heaven help poor Hub if his hand is accidentally touching me when my personal inferno goes off. 'Stop touching me, you're making me hot!\" (and I don't mean that the way I did when we were in our 20s!) I keep hoping this is a radiation side effect that 'settles down', but it has not improved one bit in the past 6 months. This boob hurts every day.",

I find myself worrying about all sorts of stuff, and I HATE this wary feeling that something is stalking me, waiting to pounce. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel node removal April 12 of this year. The surgery and resulting trauma were to the outer portion of my breast, closest to armpit. Now, that same breast, inner portion, is vaguely red. All the time. A blotch of red the size of my hand. Hard to detect, a blush, not a vivid splash. If you look close the skin looks like you can see little dots, like expanded hair follicles. Like enlarged pores. The other breast does not have this. When I squeeze this breast, the pinkish flesh area looks exactly like an orange peel. When I squeeze the other breast it just looks wrinkled and squeezed. Even though the left breast is smaller now due to losing mass to the lumpectomy, every night when I take my bra off, the seams and lines of the bra have left marked ridges and indents in that breast. Almost like the breast swells during the day and really presses against the bra. Since that breast is smaller you'd think it would be less affected by the seams. Instead, every night, I have serious dents, bumps and ridges in that breast. I am trying not to flip out, but I am. I keep trying to convince myself these are temporary changes due to recent surgery. But this portion of my breast was unaffected by the surgery! It should not be red, it should not be dimpled under pressure, it should not be swelling. I do not like this. I am flipping out.",

If you are interested, the Bach Flower Remedies (of which the Rescue Remedy is one) are interesting to learn about. Something to take your mind off the bad thoughts and worries. I am upset reading about the doctor brushing you off. That just makes me mad! I have a prescription I've had since 1992 when my daughter was born. I went a little bonkers and became CONVINCED that she was going to die in her sleep and it would be my fault for being a bad mother and I could prevent this if I checked on her every 15 minutes, all night long, every night, to make sure that I never missed being there if she needed me to save her ... And when I went to my doctor, pretty much a zombie, all twitchy and bleary eyed he said whoa, lady, take a pill! All these years later I still have that bottle of pills and over the past years I have taken a few to get me past the very worst moments in my life when crippling anxiety made me curl into a ball, cry, shake and throw up. But mostly just knowing I have them if I really need them has even been a help. Somehow knowing they're there makes me feel a bit more able to face things. And if I can't face things, can't deal, I take one and say, tomorrow is a new day but for now I need to check out. Go back when your regular doc is in town and say you need something. (and tell him to stuff his book up his...) As for books, there is one I suggest to people who struggle with anxiety. It helped me through a very bad time in my life. Hope and Help For Your Nerves by Dr. Claire Weekes. It is old and might be out of print, but if you can get a copy used, I found it explained how I was feeling when no one else seemed to grasp it. And feeling understood was a big help to me. I am sorry you are hurting. This is a terrible thing and has a way of making us feel isolated and cut off, different from everyone else in our lives, set apart somehow, even as we share a forum with tens of thousands of other women who are in our shoes. There is no way to describe it. I hope you find some peace.",

I was diagnosed with architectural distortion most indicative of a radial scar. I freaked out. I read Dr. Google. There is good information and bad information and that is a bad time to try and absorb information because this situation panics most people. We do not think clearly in the beginning of any cancer diagnosis, or just the threat of diagnosis. My understanding of radial scars was that they were a bit of a nebulous gray area. In my case I was told repeatedly that 'cancer usually looks and behaves in certain ways and you do not have anything that looks that way, but we can't be absolutely sure so a biopsy is suggested to put everyone's mind at ease.\" I almost didn't have one. I almost said no. I felt that my reading pointed to too many times when a radial scar turned out to be nothing. Did I want to go through the nasty process of biopsies to find out I'm okay? I would have been traumatized by the procedures and experience even if the news turned out to be good. I am a massive coward and doctors, hospitals and needles are my trigger points for terror. I had every reason in the world to take a pass on further testing. I had also read over and over that needle biopsies give notoriously unreliable results with radial scars. There is some split opinions over how 'dangerous' a radial scar is, but there seemed to be a consensus that a needle biopsy is just not the best way to go in the case of radial scar. So I decided to take the plunge and just have a chunk of the darn thing cut out and let's clear this nonsense up once and for all. I went through all the hoopla and procedures, convinced that it would be nothing, like everyone said. But it wasn't nothing. It was cancer. And I was mad, terrified and changed forever. I think the scare of just being down this rabbit hole can change a person forever, rattle them so badly. Maybe that is what's going on with you. I read lots. I asked questions. I did not blindly do what my doctors told me to do. But at the end of the day I wanted to know. My husband wanted to know. My daughter wanted to know. And yes the knowing was bad and sometimes what looks like anger on the surface, is really a terrible, deep mourning. You have been bit, deeply and maybe permanently, by the black dog named Terror. Maybe with you it manifests with questioning and wondering about the sad state of the status quo. I understand this absolutely. I hope with the passage of time you forget about this and move back into your 'normal' life. Life BC, before Cancer. I would like to say I'm glad I found the cancer and treated it. Yes, it's out of my body. I hope. For now. But where it will never be out of, ever, is my head. That damage is permanent. I'm still angry about it. I get where you are coming from.",

Maybe though when I look hard at someone, when I attend every nuance and subtlety and every detail, what I am doing is giving THEM something to hold on to after I am gone. Maybe I am giving them the knowing that I SAW them, I FELT them, that they were in my eyes and heart and they were more precious than gold. They were everything. Maybe that's the point of this intense attention, maybe it's for them and not me. I too have been surprised by the people who never really checked in on me again after the initial 'we're so sorry to hear you have cancer'. Not that I expect everyone to rush in and fall at my feet wailing. But there were a few from whom I expected more contact and have been deeply hurt by their conspicuous absence. In other ways, I have become very selfish and guarded with my time. I want my immediate family around me and I want time and energy for them and find that too much outside peopling can drain the energy I would rather give to those who matter. So in that way there might be people who say that I have left them behind since I was diagnosed, and that might be a truthful statement. My Husband. God. Where to start? I was 17 years old when I first got in a car on a date with this tall, thin, completely uncoordinated, guy who was so shy that speaking was painful for him. How on earth did he ever work up the nerve to ask me on a date? That was 37 years ago. A lifetime. In the recovery room after lumpectomy, rising up from the depths of anesthetic, I was aware of everything but not able to move, speak or open my eyes. I heard everything. Nurses coming and going, machines beeping. I heard him, sitting there, breathing and knew that everything the world had to offer me was right there. And I felt whole. Our relationship is not perfect and at times I want to move out and live by myself. And I might! Cancer might have turned me into a lunatic who does irrational things! But I know that I love him and he is a good person. Which is not to say I like the role of wife anymore, but that is another topic for another day! This site brings me two things in equal measure: comfort and mute horror. The knowledge that there are others walking the walk and horror at how many of us there are! For all of us I have but one wish :peace. Peace in your heart with what you have around you, peace in your heart with where you're going. Peace with how things turn out. Peace when you close your eyes at night and have that coffee first thing in the morning. Peace as we fight and cry and go to appointments and panic over pains and lumps and make cookies and fold laundry. If you find that peace, bless you, and let the rest of us know how you did it! Outstanding thread, Micmel. You are a singularly outstanding soul.",

But I'm going to do it anyway and it runs a little counterintuitive. I have probably said it before so forgive me if this is a repeat. Since tamoxifen killed off most of my brain cells (I only had the three to begin with!) I can't remember anything I do or say. So I often repeat. Are you having a bad day, week, month? That's okay. Go ahead. Be as miserable as you need to be and do not feel bad about it, do not apologize about it, do not think you need to get better or do better. Give yourself permission to feel as lousy as you need to feel for as long as you need to feel that way. Go with it. If you open your eyes in the morning and some fool says, what a glorious day, you tell them to shut up and suck an egg because the day stinks and no one is going to upsell you a lovely day when you know damn well this day sucks balls! When I was young I had a nervous breakdown. Or some kind of breakdown. It was hell. And every time one of those rising waves of panic would start washing in I'd panic at the thought of the panic and the more I freaked out to try and prevent the panic the worse it got! It was a compounding vicious circle / cycle! I read a book that said basically when that shitty feeling of terror comes sweeping in greet it and say, \"Oh, hello Terror. I see you have arrived. I guess you are here to make me feel like pooping and throwing up all at once, right here, while I'm getting my haircut. That's cool. I guess I'll do those things and see what other evil you have in store for me. So do your worst, you have my full attention. I am here to feel utterly terrible with you. Knock yourself out.\" When you resist and fight the terror, that gives it something to pound against. Mainly you. But when you accept, acknowledge and go with the terror, just allowing yourself to feel as rotten as you are going to feel, committed to going the distance without fight or resistance, suddenly you take some of the wind out of the sails. As you float and flow with your feelings, not fight against them, it slowly softens the blow. So while the advice to think positive and do positive and be positive is indeed good advice, you have to go through the bad stuff first to get there. You are in a miserable place right now and you want it to go away. The more you want that the more it hurts that you are still miserable. So... Just. Be. Miserable. and don't even think of being anything else. Commit to it. Embrace it. Be the best miserable you can be! Work it! On super horrible days of blackness post as Muckmel - or something creative. Wear your misery like a fur coat that is sleek and glossy and uber sexy! Then, when you aren't looking, just as you are truly getting the hang of going with the misery, it will begin to lift. Ever so slightly. Like fog that slowly begins to burn off in the sun. Because it does not matter how thick the fog is, the sun always wins. ALWAYS. The sun is out there. But right now your job is to roll in the fog like a pro. Don't look for the sun. It will find you. It truly will. All my love.",

My first thought was, punch him in the throat. Hard. Twice. My next thought was, in my connected Italian family we have ways of dealing with situations like this. Ways where no evidence, or body, is ever found. A phone call, a few thousand dollars in small bills, problem solved. It might be worth having him overhear you having a phone conversation with a hit man. Stand outside his door as he sleeps, kick the door a few times, then say loudly into a phone \"He is a short, squat, toad like looking young man and if you shoot him in the face it will make identification harder, do I have to pay extra for a face shot?\" I would also do things like listen to VERY LOUD music when he is sleeping, vacuum outside his bedroom door repeatedly, bang on his door and shout things like YOU SHOULD GO OUTSIDE IT'S A NICE DAY OUT THERE, YOU WHACKED OUT TROLL!! He may have rights to your home (doubtful) but does he have rights to your food? When you see him about to raise a spoon to his lips, hit him with a broom or rolled up newspaper. Is he in the shower? Flush every toilet and turn on every hot water tap. Go Ninja on his ass. Make the next 30 days super, duper pleasant. No holds barred. Go with your bad self! The rules might say you can't get rid of him but they do not say you have to be sane or accommodating in any other way. I agree with what Egad said. This rift cannot be blamed on the son in law. He is but a symptom. I am sorry dear Micmel, but the blame rests with your daughter. She is entirely responsible for who she has chosen, for being wilfully supportive of his shitty conduct, and for staying with him anyway. She is not a slave. She is an adult with full rights under the law. She could, at any time, have thrown the shitwad to the curb. If she remains in your home knowing that you have asked them to leave and knowing that he has threatened you with legal action ... let her go. Let her go. She is already gone. Others have advised you to let her know you love her and are there for her. Hell no! Oh, you can love her. And sometimes love is closing the door on a child who chooses stupid and letting them learn, the hard way, the painful way. Don't be giving her an easy way out. You say, \"hey there Smarty Pants, off you go into your grown up life of subservient religious oppression and alienation from the people who love you. Knock yourself out. Learn hard. When you decide what you need to do to get yourself out of this shit mess, give me a call and tell me what steps you have taken to solve your own problem. Or not. Up to you. Until then, buh bye, I'm going to enjoy my space to myself. Closing the door now, bye, bye, bye.\" I say this because my own daughter has spent 25 years ripping my heart out of my chest with vicious glee and all I wanted to do was SAVE her from herself until the day I figured out that I was damaging her and harming her by running interference in the HARD life lessons that were heading her way. Now when she alerts me to some stupid and catastrophic choice she is making instead of doing my mom rant I stop. Think. Look at her. Smile. Nod. And say, \"Yup, you do that. There is a whole lot of valuable learning wrapped up in that choice and as your mother I say, go for it. Anything that makes you smarter is good for you and this, my dear, is going to make you a hell of a lot wiser than you are now. So go ahead. Let me know how it works out for you.\" But I DO NOT tell her I'll 'be there' for her. If she fractures the relationship so badly then she has fixing to do before 'being there; will happen. You break it, you fix it or you live without it. You can love her and leave her out in the cold until she's ready to own and admit her bullshit. Don't be so quick and easy to be there. But be ready to let her mend what was torn and heal what was ripped. My heart breaks for you. This is the perfect time to get some Kahlua and drink Brown Cows until you barf. (barf in his room, maybe on his pillow. While his head is on it) You know I am in your corner! Stupid kids are so mortifying and yours is being really stupid. Sorry to say. Hugz.",

Then one particularly bad fight and something in my head cracked. It literally made a ripping sound and that was it. I was done, this was over, TIME TO GO. From that point on I was a broken record. Not mean, no snotty, just relentless. \"Here, Hon, I folded your laundry, when are you moving out? Do you need me to get your lunch stuff, when are you moving out? There is some mail for you, I read it, I like to open your mail, when are you moving out? There's a hole in that shirt, when are you moving out?\" She finally got the message. She moved out. Of course you are loving and giving. If you stop being that way you will betray yourself, not your daughter. If you act in a way contrary to your nature, it will bother you forever. Right now she has the stain on her hands, right now she is the one who shit the bed here by being a turd. You have NOT stooped to that level and I don't think it is in your nature to do so. Withdrawing the venue or other plans that you have paid for, I think, would just add fuel to the fire of reasons to hate you and blame you. Give her none of that. Act with utter dignity in respect to the things you agreed to do. See, that is how we adult. We DO the things we say we will do and we CARE about the reasonable expectations of other people. As much as you are hurting, set the example of what decent, dignified conduct looks like. Do not give her ammunition to bring back against you later. You will be able to say you provided her AND her partner with a home, food and support. You will be able to say that despite how incredibly hurt and betrayed you were, you stood by your word with honour and did the things you said you would. The only person who acted like an asshole in that scenario was your daughter. It is HER responsibility , at some point, to explain to you what the hell she was thinking and apologize. But in the meantime, keep your promises then get them out. At which point you no longer owe her a damn thing. Take a deep breath and just hold tight through the next few events. Yes, I agree, she does not deserve anything. However, this is not about what she deserves. This is about you not tossing another log on the fire by going back on your agreements. The steps you take, your conduct under heat (and this is heat!) may very well determine if this rift can be healed, or become permanent. Right now you want her gone. But you don't want her gone forever. Leave the door open. I think not paying for her party will be slamming the door shut. You want to get through the reception and then close the door gently and with grace, with her on the other side of it. She can always knock. But she might not if it was slammed in her face with an act of (deserved) angry revenge. Remember, every one of us totally gets why you are angry and we are angry for you! We would all want to pull the plug on the party too! But, in the end, I think it would be a bad move. That is what my gut tells me. I am so sorry you are in this mess!",

Everyone's life has ups and downs, but cancer seems to throw it all into a huge spotlight. I have been trying to get a small home business selling hand crafted items, off the ground for the last few months. I have been working hard at promoting it, getting the word out through Facebook, driving door to door, dropping off my cards, telling people what I have available. All of this is WAY out of my comfort zone. I am not a salesman. I feel cumbersome and bothersome. Like a nuisance. Which is not a great feeling for me. But yesterday was an awesome day and I made a big sale, completely unexpectedly! I was so happy! Immediately. Instantly. On the heels of any moment of joy or mirth comes the thought that cancer is going to show up somewhere and snatch it away. Finally, at this ripe old age of mid 50s I'm finding a little something that I enjoy and it makes me feel useful and productive and even returns a tiny profit, and all I can hear is the smashing of the clock as I feel my good time ticking away. I know I might have years left. I know they 'caught it early' (which frankly gives me little comfort after reading many of the stats on this site). But despite what people tell me in way of encouragement, it's what I FEEL that utterly knocks me off my feet. I think it's the biggest thing for many of us. KNOWING where this is going to end. How do you wrap your head around it? I go longer and longer stretches without thinking about cancer, and that is a blessed relief from the past year! But still, when life is the sweetest, that bitter bitch cancer comes flouncing in the room and craps all over my happy moment. Living in the face of what is going on, or what will be going on, or what might never go on, or what might be going on right now and I don't know it .... that is the secret. A secret I don't have yet. But it made me realize that as much as I think cancer is behind me, no it's not. Is it ever, really? I don't know.",

Your husband is probably more concerned with his own feelings of discomfort if he says no to some unreasonable request. People expect him to jump and run.

He said the truly amazing thing about humans is that we're not all wiped out into immobile paralysis by the truths in our lives. Truths being that life is hard, we are frail and fragile subject to many vagaries over which we have no control, that we toil until we die and then yes, we do DIE! He said, in light of this reality, that any of us get up and carry on is the true miracle. Life itself is just cause for a crippling case of PTSD if you look at the reality of it. Hearing this made me think of how we cancer patients often beat ourselves for feeling knocked down and wiped out. When people ask me how I am I say, \"Well it took a while to pull my head out of my ass..\" which is really the wrong thing to say. Having an up close and personal reminder of your mortality is NOT having your head up your ass - it is looking life and death squarely in the face and realizing that your best before date might be past! What I went through last year was not because I was confused and silly - it was because my head was forcibly pulled OUT of my ass and I could no longer ignore the reality of my mortality. I have to think it's the 'other people' who have their heads up their asses, those people who like to quip \"we could all get hit by a bus..' which they say absolutely blind to the fact that it truly does apply to them. Because people who say that stuff think they are somehow exempt. It's a whole other ballgame when you are sitting in a doctors office and he looks at you and says, \" You have just been hit by the cancer bus.\" I think feeling sad and tense and scared and uncertain and unmotivated and like I want coffee AND a chocolate bar is the ONLY SANE RESPONSE to this. Yet we all want to get back to how we were before we knew we had cancer. Is that possible? Is that even a good idea? We talk about embracing the 'new normal' (barf), instead maybe we ought to consider that we are, for perhaps the first time in our lives, having normal reactions to a reality that we can no longer ignore? Maybe we are saner than anyone around us! Maybe our distress is a sign that we are living in the moment, aware of the truth of the moment and reacting the way any thinking being would. These are the thoughts I am having today and I know where there is a chocolate bar that Hub thinks he has stashed in a secret place. Bwa ha ha, there are no secret places! So I am going to eat chocolate and ponder the universe. Hi all. I read and smile, worry, cry, or pray.",

Thinking about this makes me feel .... I'm not sure I know the word. It's like when we stand in silence to observe something of great importance and gravity. I look back over the past year and feel a grave silence. It was shattering. We survived. Sort of. For now. For short or long, no one can say. But for now, I am here. It might have gone a different way. For many it has. I feel very much that I need to be still, be silent, reflect and see where I have been, who travelled with me, how many of us are still on this journey that demands that we live even as we carry the burden upon us. This anniversary feels significant and my heart feels sober and heavy. I know in this circle of women there is understanding.",

The work it takes for you to keep everyone and their events straight and current, you are AMAZING! You have made this thread, as others have said, a warm safe room where everyone can be who they are and feel what they feel and not be made to feel bad about it. Cancer gives us enough to feel bad about, we don't need to make it worse. So, if you are tired, if being the center of this universe is wearing you out, take a break if you need to. But we will miss you. I know I will. But I still support you in doing whatever you need to do. For you! We all want you to know what you need and get it. If that's a break, then you take your break! Don't know if I mentioned it here or not (tamoxifen brain, can't remember shit) but early July a pee test showed blood and doc said, well, if the cancer has spread he wants to know now, not later. Ordered ultrasound of bladder and kidneys and more pee tests. So we can get on it early. Ordered tests in July. My ultrasound date is January 2019. Please tell me how a stinking 6 month wait for an ultrasound is EARLY detection?!? Got my knickers in a knot and called doc office and said either they could phone and rattle some chains or I could, but either way, if there is something bad going on and doc wants to know early, THIS IS NOT EARLY!! Doc calls me back and says, I have your cytology pee test results (three pees over three days) and there is nothing cancerous, nothing worrisome, nothing suspicious and the blood you have is TRACE amounts. (I always have trace amounts. Always. For over 40 years.) So he did NOT feel, based on the pee test, that I needed to worry and waiting until January for the ultrasound wold probably be fine. But if something changes, if I feel any symptoms at all....call him and he'll makes sure things get done pronto. I am very pleased with this new doc. He is on the ball! So.. I think this is good news. Whew. Micmel, I am tucking you in bed in your new room with a juicy book, a tall glass of milk and a box of Oreo cookies. That is a good time right there! Bless you my dear hearted friend. Hugs and strength to all you other ladies too. All of you should go buy yourselves some Oreos.",

It goes on to say that it might be surgical scarring, or it might be cancer, not sure, hard to tell, hmmm, we'll wait and see. As for getting on with my life, this is NOT helping! I feel uncertain every day and this has just shoved me further out onto thin ice! If the whole point of radiation after lumpectomy is to nuke any 'stray' cancer cells, then it obviously didn't achieve that goal ! The 'architectural distortion' that was on my 2016 mammogram, that hurled me off this cliff, is still there!!! I have an Oncotype 11, but I suppose any faint hope that provides goes out the window if there's a pile of leftover cancer percolating away in my boob. I assume Oncotypes are given on the understanding that cancer is removed and not left behind. I do not blame the surgeon. I had a very weird radial scar that presented no palpable mass. The pathology report showed clear margins. Before the lumpectomy that radiologist fellow harpooned me with a tiny spear right into the middle of the mess to guide the surgeon there. I feel that everything was done as well as it could be. But I have no 'team'. I have seen 4 doctors over the course of treatment and not only are they not in the same hospital, they're not even in the same town! Team schmeem. I feel like I've been thrown out of the bus to deal with this on my own. I have called the rad onc and hope she can tell me what a breast, 4 months after radiation, should look like. Should it be OBVIOUS that the cancer is gone? Should it be OBVIOUS what is scarring and what is more cancer? Because, according to the mamm and ultrasound, nothing is obvious at all and cancer cannot be ruled out. They want another look in 6 months - or I could have an MRI. Here, waiting for an MRI takes 10 - 14 months. Although I could have one at a private clinic if I'm willing to pay for it, which I am. If anyone has any light to shed on this situation, please do. I was so hoping to hear, yup, looks good. That is NOT what I heard. The black cloud is descending.

Go away and wait 6 months ... uh, no. I did call my radiation oncologist and bless her heart, she called me back and when I was done talking to her I felt at least that I understood the situation more clearly. She put everything in some sort of context, painted a BIG picture and helped me get perspective. Which is what I needed. I asked, didn't a month of radiation kill all the cancer? If I walked in with cancer, did I walk out with that same cancer? She said yes, if you walked in with a breast full of cancer you left radiation with that same breast full of cancer. The radiation I was given was designed to mop up a few, stray cells that might have been left behind after surgery. It was NOT designed to kill the amount of cancer cells in a tumour. So if I arrived with a mass of cancer, it was still there when I finished radiation. She said she had reviewed my pathology reports and the margins were good. She felt confident that the surgeon had gotten the mass, as targeted with a wire guide. She said the suggestion of an MRI might result in misleading conclusions since a contrast dye is watched for how smoothly it flows in and out of an area. If it flows with difficulty and constriction, that can lead to suspicion of cancer. But in my case, this breast had a surgical biopsy, was cut again a month later in a lumpectomy, then I had a post op bleed, all the internal stitching tore out and the surgeon opened me up again that same day, re-cauterized everything and put back together all the torn apart internal stitches. In other words I have a very LARGE amount of scarring. This boob has had a scalpel in it 3 times (armpit one time). So, in my particular case, an MRI might make things look even worse - save that until all other avenues of investigation have been used, said the radiation oncologist. She said the wording of the report sounds dire, it is cautious, but we have to also see what is NOT there. No one suggested a biopsy. She said if the radiologist felt there was much chance at all that the remaining architectural distortion was still active cancer, I would not have left the hospital that day without someone doing a biopsy right then and there. But no one showed up to poke my boob - so, reading between the lines, this is a good sign even though the language is worrying. She said she sees I requested a 2nd opinion on my original pathology report so she was requesting a 2nd opinion on the mammogram and ultrasound. Someone at the cancer clinic there would have a look. She will get back to me with the results some time this week. She also said if waiting 6 months for another mammogram makes me uncomfortable, go in again in 3 months or 4. Up to me. I do not have to wait 6 months. So the original bad news architectural distortion that showed up Dec 2016 is still there Dec 2017. Is it a scar? Is it cancer? I feel less freaked out than I did. Waiting to hear now what a second set of eyes thinks the situation is. Thank you all for listening.",

Just one, lone cough every 10 minutes or so. Chest feels congested but I produce no phlegm. Do not rattle or gurgle when breathing, although I do wheeze a bit sometimes. By the end of the day I have often lost my voice and sound hoarse and croaky. My chest has that achy feeling I've had with pneumonia. I DO NOT cough in bed at night and most mornings do not cough when I get up, not until I've been awake for quite a while. I ignored this because I thought it was allergies triggered by the very heavy smoke in the air this past summer. Then I continued to ignore it because I don't want to know. I think my brain will meltdown if I get any more bad news. I have a doctor appt later this week. I know there are no doctors here to make a diagnosis. I am asking if anyone else had similar symptoms, a dry, annoying, tickling cough that produced nothing, and what did it turn out to be? I am terrified. I feel that I can't talk about it to anyone because they are all sick of hearing about how scared I am. I feel like I will be letting people down if I have lung mets. Because I was supposed to be fine, it was early stage, I had a low oncotype (11) blah, blah, blah. I do not feel safe. I do not feel 'out of the woods'. I do not feel I can share this anywhere but here with other people who truly get it. I am barely keeping it together. Sorry for that.

Go ahead and find another companion but DO NOT let her and her kids shove our child out of the picture. In other words, don't think with your dick! However, I also think that if Hub spends the next 20 years with a companion he loves and who adds value and comfort to his life, if he dies, she should not be left penniless and homeless for her years of love and care. I see that too often too when someone dies and the kids come swooping in and put the surviving partner (who came along as a second partner) out of the home they have had for 20 years. I think that is wrong. Leaving your kids out is wrong and letting your kids shove your partner out is also wrong. Of course, planning to AVOID theses scenarios takes legal steps and forethought and one thing Hub is not good at is getting shit done unless I'm here to nag at him about it. He will meet a new woman, move her into our home, he'll be thinking that he should draw up some papers to make the division of assets cut and dried but he'll just never do it. Cause that's how he rolls and it makes me insane! I see the nuclear fallout, over and over, of people who do NOT take care of these legal steps NOW, when it's time.

Today Hub and I, with our hearts in our throats, walked into the oncologist office to hear what the results of my Oncotype Test. 11. I scored an 11. He said, \"no chemo for you, lady. The survival benefit you will get from chemo will be ZERO.\" And he made a zero with his fingers to emphasize the point. I will be doing Tamoxifen and radiation, as expected. But no chemo. He was clear to say this does NOT mean that I won't get a new, different breast cancer later. But that this cancer has a very low risk of setting up shop elsewhere in my body. Hub and I should have been jubilant. Ecstatic. Instead we sat there like two, mute lumps. I think we were so braced for bad news that the good news flew right past us. Poor oncologist. When he shares bad news he has to weather the bad emotions but when he gets to share good news instead of high fiving him we sat there like two idiots. We came home and took a two hour nap. I think the tension and dread as this day approached has drained us both. We are almost afraid to be happy. Afraid to be relieved. A cancer diagnosis can leave you shell shocked and wary. Expecting that there are bears in the woods - because we know there are! But I am beginning to feel that I can live, make plans and that really shows up how much cancer had shut me down and taken away my options. I never realized how bad it was until it was lifted off me. So in case anyone wants to know, I am 11. I will be a Tamox taker and radiation participant. I mourn for every woman (and man) who battles through chemo.

I am of the opinion that if the house needs updating, you are better off to drop your asking price by a reasonable amount and avoid the initial outlay in material and labour and let new owners install the fixtures, floors and wall colours they want. It saves you the trouble and time and bringing the price down will broaden possible buyers. At least that's how I see things. Keep it easy. But still .... happy!",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2018 03:10PM - edited Apr 17, 2018 11:22PM by runor Micmel, adult daughters at home are a double edged sword. Mine moved home two years ago after having been out on her own for two years. No sooner did I get used to her being gone them boom, she was back and I had to get used to her being back! Now she might be moving out again and I am torn because I feel opposing emotions. One emotion is that I will miss her energy and conversation and hearing about her life and having her come to me for advice. I will NOT miss the mess, the 11 year old reaction to being asked to help, the extra work she makes with cooking and cleaning and laundry and when she has horses here, I always end up being the stable boy because she works very odd shift hours and is often not here to do the chores when needed. I have moved a LOT of horse shit over the years! But really, she needs to be on her own for her own sake. She needs to figure out who she is when mom isn't around to solve all the problems. And I have to become more of a friend to her and less of the same mother I was when she was a teenager. Making that shift is hard and awkward because I will always be her mother. But I want to be her mother in a slightly different way. Still loving, but more distant and a bit less available to solve all problems. After a point problem solving becomes a form of keeping our kids stupid and dependent and that is NOT the point of parenting! Like you, I crave order, peace and serenity. I need my surroundings to be neat, clean and sane. More and more I am getting anti-social and resent demands that take me away from doing the things I want to do. I have to watch that or I could easily become a shut in hermit with no time for other people. But often the majority of other people do not bring anything positive to my life. I do have some people in my life who are true gems and I love them and for them there is ALWAYS time! But not everyone fits that category and the rest of them can shove off - I have things to do. So I understand you looking for that moment of peace when the flurry and snippiness and not grown up behaviour is gone. And still you will miss her so much. It's like being a little crazy!",

One, an extreme people pleaser, avoiding growing up and dealing with feeling bad sometimes, so they say yes to everyone all the time to avoid their own inner feelings of discomfort at having to say no. They do what they do because of how THEY feel, not because they care about the other person, they just want to never feel inner turmoil themselves. So instead of taking the bullet themselves, they be the nice guy to outsiders and let the bullet hit wife and kids. There is nothing nice about it at all. (same applies to men who work in excess, it's avoidance of life and it hurts everyone around them ) Two, my hub gets MAXIMUM love, admiration and positive feedback for MINIMUM input to others. He has said that when he does something nice for me it's great, fine, but before long I need something nice done again. Where as he can be hero to a work buddy once a year and gets maximum points for how great, giving, smart, and generous he is. But he and work buddy have no relationship that needs tending or sustaining. There is nothing on-going between them. Those long term HARD relationships in which caring and giving is an everyday, all day, until we drop dead commitment, THAT IS TOO HARD. He wants and gets the instant gratification of giving a little help / love to someone else and gets to hear himself called a hero. It's a cheap thrill. He gets his feedback addiction fed by others- and I deal with life on my own, because he has this almost sick need to have everyone think he's a great guy and he gets that, easily and cheaply, from people with whom he has no ongoing relationship. (usership is NOT relationship. He has lots of repeat users.) I have told a close friend that should this disease come back and wipe me out, if at my graveside my Hub open his yap and says something like \"I should have taken better care of her when I had her and spent the time with her she asked me to ...\" I have instructed to her to punch him in the face as hard as she can. I have NO PATIENCE for people who KNOW they need to do better but REFUSE to do so when it counts. My Hub is absolutely serving him SELF in what he does and anyone who believes otherwise is an idiot. (him at the top of that list!) I did not hate my Hub when I sat down at the computer but now I do. Wow. But seriously. Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of when I walked into the cancer clinic and stayed there for three weeks of treatment. Tomorrow our daughter is finally moving back out after being home for two years. And as not good as those two years were, they were something else to focus on. That is all leaving. Bad memories are roiling to the surface. I feel a dark sadness rolling in. And I am scared that my marriage might not be intact when the dust settles. To be honest, in the anonymity of the internet, I don't think my marriage has been intact for years and years. And if I leave NO ONE will get it - because Hub is the greatest guy they have ever known. And he is. Great guy. Piss poor husband. (wow, I am really sour today. I hope I have better things to share another day!)",

I hope for you, and for everyone, a brighter day and some good moments that make up for some of the bad. Keetmom, I read your posts and my heart skips a beat. Sending strength. This is a random thought that has been rolling around inside my head. I will roll it out here, maybe flatten it like pie dough and see what comes of it. LIVE EVERY DAY LIKE IT'S YOUR LAST. How many times have I heard that in the past year and a half? My god, constantly. I almost expect a team of cheerleaders waving pompoms to come bouncing out and start blowing kazoos and shooting off confetti cannons. Yet, more and more that single sentence is bothering me on a deep level and it finally occurred to me what was bothering me about it. It is an astonishingly stupid thing to say. Have you ever seen prisoner's on death row the day of their execution? Are they having a great time on their last day? Are they blissful and bouncy and smelling the roses? How about people marched out into fields and shot execution style by their corrupt and evil governments. Are they all \"woohoo, this is my last day, everything is so fabulous and I must soak it all in and appreciate it all\"? No. Not even close. Not even a little bit. Paralyzing terror and grief so profound it manifests as physical pain, THAT is what most sane people feel knowing this is their last day. For many of us, death is the worst thing we can imagine, and as we imagine it FEW of us rise above into angelic, transcendent world view. And yet, without truly thinking of what we're saying, we tell each other to live each day as if it is our last. That kind of misery is unsustainable and very quickly becomes its own form of unending hell and suffering. I get why we say that to each other. We are admonishing each other to pay attention. See the small, beautiful things. Smell the rain, drink the coffee. Look into the eyes of your kids and loved ones. Marvel in fresh washed sheets dried on the line or garden fresh peas as they pop out of the pod. But all of these things can be torn away from us over the terror and agony of knowing that we are dying. It is very hard to be in the moment and concerned with dying at the same time. And if you are a cancer person you have an ugly reality on one side, and the Carlton Card people telling you how to live (like it's your last) on the other side, ripping you in two opposite directions. When I think about where this diagnosis might end, I am destroyed. It has taken a year to tentatively poke my toe into the land of the living. It is hard to make plans thinking I might not be around to finish them. If I lived each day as if it was my last I would not make a move at all. I would fall on my face and weep over everything I was going to lose. For all eternity. Our last day is likely to not be our best day. Especially if we know it's coming. I think we have to examine, deeply, the way we try to lift each other up and while the intnetion behind those words is good, they actually describe a crisis instead of a gift. This is some messy pie dough. I don't know if I am making sense. But sometimes I have these half baked ideas that I can't unthink.",

I had only one lousy node removed. Surgeon said she dug around quite a bit and cut down into lower layers looking for others, but she never found more nodes despite having injected me with the green dye (which made me break out, head to toe in a red blotchy rash, I am allergic). So with only ONE node gone I should not have had any problems. WRONG! I had lymphedema in breast, armpit,m arm, side, ribs and the boob itself. I have managed to mostly find ways to deal with armpit, side and rib swelling. However, every morning the FIRST thin that greets me is pain in my breast, which swells and hurts. Weirdly the pain in my breast is where I did NOT have the lumpectomy. This tends to panic me because it was pain in my breast that made me have a mammogram in the first place last year and started me down this shitty road. So now when my boob still hurts, my brain automatically says, oh, it's more cancer. Hub and I were talking about cancer and between bites of toast he said, breast cancer doesn't hurt, and I flipped my lid. Yes it does! YEs it does hurt! This idea people have that bc doesn't hurt is wrong! There is a thread asking if you had pain before initial diagnosis and many women said yes. Ugh. Sometimes I wonder if he's been paying attention at all. I will be managing lymphedema the rest of my life. I have exercises that help, but sometimes the swelling wins. And it hurts. Aches. Feels like someone is injecting fluid in to the back of my hand. It is so gross and awful!",

Overall, it was a crappy day. I was black and blue to my pubic bone and in extreme pain! Now to the pillow part of this morbid story. I slept with a breast pillow. My boobs are very large and heavy and when I rolled over at night to lay, ever so gingerly, on my side, I needed that breast pillow plumped against my boob to give it a bit of support. Not under my breast, but up against it, to stop it from spreading out, like a puddle. That pillow helped a LOT! You don't want a hard one, squishy is good. It just needs to stabilize your breast to help with the pain. Now, after radiation, I find new and surprising breast pains (ugh) and still I find sometimes sleeping with my arms around a pillow (on my side) stops my breasts from flopping the way gravity would normally effect them (god, this is so NOT sexy!), but having that bit of front support is the difference between pain and no sleep, or no pain and happy sleep. Pillows are good. They do not need to be fancy. I had a small heart shaped one. You won't be sorry.",

It's pollen season now and I am being hyper vigilant to see if I start hacking but so far all is well. We do put filters in our furnace and in our vents and they get filthy!

I couldn't find it. Couldn't find anything. Figured I have to come to your house and give you a lesson on How To Be Offensive. Or better, take a lesson from that dipshit neighbour of yours. Seems the woman has achieved a level of offense before she has coffee in the morning. Sadly, she reminds me a bit of my mom. My poor mom. She opens her mouth and out comes words that ought to have the warning NO THOUGHT WAS ATTACHED TO THIS SENTENCE. Once some friends had an infant son who died. It was tragic. They were bereft. What did my mom say? \"You're young, you can have another one.\" I could Not. Believe. Her!!!! There are people who are very hate-filled vicious people who say this stuff constantly because they are wildly passive aggressive and not at all in touch with their inner rage. So it manifests as barbs and jabs that seem innocent, but are not. Then there are people who lack the mental ability to grasp the social norms of our society and don't have the skill to not look like complete asses. Everything they say offends and yet their face just keeps flapping and it takes a huge amount of energy to not throat punch them. I feel very sorry for this woman's daughter because when your mother is like that, a mental hole, it's like having no mother at all. It's having someone who has no discernment or tact and can display no compassion or support or kindness. The woman might have a brain that performs below normal, she can't get along in polite society - and her kid has paid the price. Not fair. I am sorry you have to encounter her but it sounds like she is one of those disabled people who can't figure out why everyone avoids her. Lynnwood, I am so sorry to hear that things might be getting worse. I identified with your description of anxiety and the physical agony that goes along with it. Just tell yourself that once you've dropped your Hub off at work and have gotten home you are taking TWO of those Ativans! Oh yes you are - going to sleep for 3 days straight! Hugs and peace to you.

The moment I realize I have had an excellent day I remember that I have nothing between me and a recurrence but a tamoxifen tablet and I immediately feel unsafe, vulnerable, exposed, hunted, deer-in-headlights. Things are good, now. But I would be a bloody fool to count on it staying this way for any length of time because I just don't know. No one does. Micmel, I have had dark, despairing thoughts where the enormity of the blackness is a thick blanket I can't get out from under. But, as I have said before, the sun will find you. One small beam of light will catch your eye and you'll think, huh, there is light after all. It will drain your energy if you grope around seeking the light. Instead, be still, rest, be ready, when you see it, like glimpsing a fairy in the woods on a spring day, say quietly to your soul, look, over there, shhh, don't move or you'll scare it, a fairy! So pretty! She shines and sparkles. Seeing a fairy does not make everything in your life better, but it's a little bit of magic to hold in your heart until the next bit of magic comes along. And it will. You have to have eyes to see it. Same with the light that will shine and momentarily lift your heart. I know the blackness feels like hell. In fact it is my personal belief that that blackness IS hell. The absence of light is hell. But light wins. Every time. I know you will see sparks and flashes, glimpses and fairies. I know it. I believe it for you. I am waiting with you in quiet, gentle anticipation. And love.",

But I have hit the end of my rope. I have one daughter. I home schooled her. Our relationship has been terrible forever. Not because of homeschooling, which people love to blame. No, her problems began back in infancy when it became obvious that she had rage issues. Other people noticed these rage issues. Yet there seemed nothing to do about them. As she got older and more verbal, her desire to inflict deliberate harm and go for the maximum hurt with her words grew and grew. It became a source of power and feedback for her, how badly can she hurt someone? Especially if that someone has been kind and giving and loving. Betrayal of those who care the most seems to hold a special thrill and delight. I have tried to figure out how to describe it and evil is the only word that seems to fit. The sick hunger to hurt and destroy those who have done you a kindness. Mostly that has been me. When she was a teen, well, all teens can be ugly so I gritted my teeth and put up with horrible, insane treatment hoping to god she'd grow out of it. She never did. At 21 I finally booted her out after years of being called a C$*& and a Fingbi(%@ and everything else, because I asked her to clean her room or wash a dish. It didn't matter what I asked or how, I was a target for a spear to the chest. There was no holding back with her. No standard that she wouldn't stoop to. No, she will stoop to the filthiest, most offensive lows that she can find. If she can't find a way to hurt me bad enough, she'll invent something new. I began to have anxiety and chest pains and felt like I was living in a war zone, I never knew when she was going to go off, screaming, slamming doors, breaking holes in walls. I remember the day I had had it back then, there was a literal cracking sound in my head as I knew it was time for her to GET OUT. It took another 4 months after that to actually get her out, but she needed to go and she did. The adjustment was hard but I began to love living my days without the imminent threat of attack hanging over my head. I found some peace. Hub and I liked this space with so much less anxiety and misery. Then she moved back home. I did not want her to. I really did not want her to. I told her that if she came back she had to come back as a different person with a different attitude and conduct because the shit from before could never, ever happen again. Yeah, yeah, whatever, I get it mom, blah, blah, blah, are you done talking now because I'm tired of listening to you. She moved in and immediately became the monster that had moved out and my heart was broken that she did not acknowledge the emotional mess she left behind and that she felt no need or responsibility to mend what she had broken. She has never been abused or neglected. She lived with structure and rules and expectations. She had parents who attended the things in her life that mattered to her. She has never had a reason to repay love with poison other than she wanted to. I needed to know she was different. She wasn't. The past two years have been miserable with her here. Not every day. There were good moments. But those good moments were only good if she was getting her way and no one was asking her to help or clean up her living space. If we did, then there would be a problem. A big one. Peace here came at the price of being hostage to her evil conduct when things didn't go her way. It made me resent her at a deep, deep level. It is my belief that with a little give and take life can be good for everyone, we just need to care about how someone else feels and sees the world. But she was hell bent to prove that she would never, ever have to give a shit about me or anything I cared about. And she didn't. Recently she moved out. Into an ancient house that had many years of garbage piled up and neglected structure. Hub and I have busted our guts for weeks working and loading garbage and clearing weeds and cleaning and repairing. Her and I had a disagreement over something and the FIRST thing she tells me, over text, is that I am welcome to never set foot in her home again. Go away and stay away. In other words, thanks for all your help, I could not care less about you or what you did, drop dead, you are worthless. In the past when she pulls this dirt, I get over it. I let it go. I accept whatever inadequate or non-effort she makes at making up. What she does after slaughtering my spirit is to make contact with me like nothing happened. Like telling me to stay out of her house is just no big deal. I am so done with that. I had ordered her an expensive item that her home desperately needed, that I was paying for and this time, feeling like a real ass, I cancelled it. I just thought, I am DONE DONE DONE doing right by people who shit on me at the drop of a hat. Screw you. If you want this fixed, fix it yourself. This is new for me. If my daughter read this she'd be shocked and instantly defensive. She is extremely brittle and rigid and the idea that she is responsible for ANY of the crap between us is literally too big and too vast for her to even consider. She is without blame in all things. Many people have pointed out her inability to learn from experience. She would begin to name all the ways I've failed as a mother and I admit, there were many. But when I thought I was messing up, I changed, I adjusted, she mattered enough to me that I aimed to do better, be better. But she seems literally unable to care about anyone other than in what capacity they can serve her needs. And then the more she can hurt them as she stabs them in the back, the more fun it is for her! So here's my situation. How do I quit being a mother? How do I stand back and see the destruction she brings into her own life and not say anything? ANd when she comes to me to care about her problems, or fix them, how do I gently close the door on her face, because that is what I want to do. I want to wash my hands. I want to be done with this relationship that causes me nothing but pain. I had hoped her and I could have a relationship as adults but I am pretty sure it will never, ever happen. I am a piece of garbage that she can abuse at will, and she does, without hesitance, over anything. I don't want to show up to be punched in the face anymore. I don't want to do good things for bad people. I love her. But right now I don't like her. And it makes me feel like vomiting. I believe my daughter was born with big problems. But I also believe they are not carved in stone and if she cared, she'd change. It hurts to the core that I am not worth changing for. I'm just her mom. She can shred my heart. I don't want that to happen anymore. How do I stop it? Micmel, I know you are reading this and nodding your head.",

Yeah, cherry that someone puked up. Gross. I hope you get a handle on it quickly! Lynwood, I do not think you're being overly sensitive. You are a person, not a process. A doctor is treating the whole you, not matter how they might like to piece us up for their convenience. I think it is the doctors job and responsibility to ask how you are doing, because in your response, or non-response, or denial, there are clues that a good medical professional puts to use to determine how you are doing. And that is what they should want to know, first and foremost, HOW ARE YOU DOING? They are all supposed to pledge to DO NO HARM, but unless they open the possibility of dialogue and exchange, how can they ever determine when you are indeed suffering harm? Or are doing alright? Or need a little support? Or a break? Or some counselling? My regular doc, who was new to me at the start of this cancer bullshit never once asked me how I was doing. Not once. He was not pre-emptive at all with his attitude or conduct. After a year it felt like medical neglect and I left him. My new doc, on the FIRST meeting, asked how I was feeling, how was I doing on Tamoxifen, was I getting back into life? I LOVE HIM! While your doc might be reluctant to give you feedback out of the blue, she should at least lay the groundwork for you to freely discuss things that are on your mind. A simple, tell me how you're doing? is enough. I do not think medical care is complete or adequate unless there is CARE, not just procedures, involved.",

Got the call for my 6 month mamm, to have a look at that thing in my boob that might be scar tissue but can't be ruled out as cancer. I know I shouldn't be worried. I keep reading about scanxiety, but this isn't a scan exactly. Is it? It seems that anxiety creeps up slowly while you're not looking. At first it's like, cool, mamm, knew this was coming, was expecting the call. Then it becomes, oh my god, what if they find something, what if this isn't over, what if the other boob has gone bad? There was a time I thought cancer happened to Other People. Having had that little bubble of happiness burst I live in the shadow of the Next Bad News. I can only imagine how much this compounds exponentially once you hear that you do have mets. The tension must never end and the task of living with it is Herculean! Strength to you all.",

I am an introvert who likes her home, familiar surroundings. I like my own bed with my handmade quilts and handmade pillowcases and yes, even the mattress was custom made to my specifications. So when we slip in to bed each night it is a full on sensory deep body pleasure experience. Hub and I often say, gleefully, \"We have the best bed!\" For the three weeks I was away from home doing radiation, staying at the cancer lodge, I missed my bed. The comfort and visual appeal of it. Our home is quite plain and humble, won't win any prizes for keeping up with the Jonses. But my own chickens, my own dog, my own bathtub, my own garden and good neighbours.... for me, this is it. This is where I feel most whole and rested. Now if the actual job of being a housewife could be downloaded onto someone else it would be damn near perfect!",

I managed to drag myself to a therapist because I knew I needed help and there he was, Mr. Beige in his beige office with his beige sweater vest, looking at me with an expression devoid of any personality. There I was, slack jawed, no make-up, black bags under my eyes, hair plastered to my head in a sweaty mass, probably drooling on myself, barely able to sit upright so I was sort of slumped over to one side. He says, \"Are you suicidal?\" Hmmm. Suicidal. Let me ponder this. It took me 5 minutes of intense focussed thinking this morning to realize that I had put my shoe on without a sock. Yes, a sock. That fabric tube that goes on the foot before the shoe. Sock. Find one. Where are they? I can't recall if I've ever had any. Maybe I don't like socks. Wait, I think I know where they are. Oh look, a sock is in this drawer .. hey! bonus! panties too! My mind was a septic tank of sludge and my body was in the final stages of rigor mortis and this guy was asking if I wanted to kill myself? I couldn't manage the energy to DRESS myself let alone kill myself! The fact that Hub walked me in holding me up and dropped me like a sack of potatoes should have been some indication of my overall state. But no, this dummy had to ask anyway. But the truth is I was intensely suicidal. I wished to die. It would have been so much easier than what I was feeling. So this is the answer I gave him: If the Grim Reaper knocked on my door and said Runor, we have dug a hole for you out back. Every responsibility and task in your life will be taken over and completed the way you want. No one will suffer or struggle after you're gone, the burdens of your life are guaranteed to be looked after. May I show you to your hole?\" I would have said, thank you, thank you, thank you. Yes, take me to the hole. Throw the dirt over me. God I am so tired. I am so tired. I just need to rest. Was I suicidal? Yes and no. Wanted the suffering to stop but didn't have one lick of energy to make that happen. If someone else had offered me the out, I'd have been all over it. Except for one small fly in the ointment ... my kid. And the fact that I don't think anyone would have done the job the way I wanted. For her I held on. As soul suckingly exhausted as I was. Somewhere in my addled brain I knew that I would pull out of this. Time. I just needed time. I am making a guess, but I hear an exhaustion in your voice that is impossible to communicate. Yes, you need your kids to become the grown-ups they need to be so you are free to continue this journey with your focus on your self. Your kids are of the ages where they need to be stepping up to learning and you have the biggest battle to get them there, with the least amount of energy you've ever had. It's not fair and it's not right. But I know that feeling of not thinking you can carry on for one more step. In coming to this thread and getting a better picture of your story, my admiration of you has grown in leaps and bounds. The way you respond to everyone personally. That is a HUGE job. Huge. And you do it. I don't know how. Please know that if you need to step back and take some time to do anything other than post here, not a single person would hold it against you. Rest when you can. Your kids ARE growing up, even though you might not see it. You ARE fighting to stay here for them, which is what every parent wants. I wish I could say with any certainty that you have good years ahead of you, but that is just so much hot air on this site. We are all too informed to believe that. However, there are women who live longer lives of better quality than ever before and I hope to god that is what happens for you. So, if a guy in tattered black robes knocks on your door and tells you he has a hole for you, just say no. For all of us he's lurking around, but for now you can still shut the door in his face. I send you every thought of peace, rest, strength and renewal that the universe can muster. Blessings on you, Micmel.",

I read your post about him wanting to pack it all up and take off with the horses and my heart overflowed with warmth. He is giving you such a gift! We get wrapped up in money thinking that it is going to keep us safe from all the random badness in life. We are wrong. It does not. If you can find a way to be comfortable letting go and riding off into the sunset, who knows, maybe side saddle, then do it. Enjoy the man who is willing to lay it all on the line for you. I also hope that you have some good news, a simple fix to your tummy troubles. You've had too much dumped on your plate recently. About the privacy of posts. Anything you post in a thread can be found with a Google search. It was in fact those very Google searches that lead me to threads that made me aware this site even existed! Before that I never knew there was a breastcancer.org. I never had a reason to even think about breast cancer sites, cause breast cancer happens to other people, as we all know. I am grateful that over and over I was Googled to this forum. It has been invaluable to me! When I post I do not expect privacy. While I consider myself prudent and selective about what I put out there I am not overly private. I am willing to talk about anything to anyone who wants to know and I do not worry about my name coming up in searches. However, it was learning that my private messages are not private, that mods can look at them anytime they want, THAT pissed me off! If you don't offer private messages, then don't pretend that you do. Call them what they are, possibly snooped in messages or side chatting that only mods can see. But to call them private when they are not? That is false advertising and misleading. I feel more vulnerable knowing that the Powers can look in anytime they want. THAT is an invasion of my privacy on something that is clearly promoted as PRIVATE (but isn't). Micmel, so relieved that you are sounding better. You had me worried there, girl! And now you get to be motherzilla of the bride? Oh dear. I'm sure we all look forward to reading about your adventures. Hope everyone finds peace and better days.

End of month I go for another mamm 4 months after the last mamm to compare to see if that 'area of persistent distortion' is growing or not. Everyone reassured me that it's nothing. It's scar tissue. That's all. Just scar tissue from your exploding boob lumpectomy. Half of me wants to believe that - oh god how I want to believe that. But the other half of my brain says there is just as good a chance that there IS cancer in my boob and it has been sitting in there knitting socks for the past year. As my stinking lymphedema goes out of control and things that had quit swelling are swelling up again I can't help but wonder, is this spreading cancer? That's what we all wonder! When we get a headache or burp our hearts fall to our shoes and we think, oh shit. And the losses just keep piling up and smiling women on tv jog and paddle boats and laughing with their spunky, short hair-dos. No commercials of women vomiting and shitting themselves. Or dying. As I type this I am drinking wine. Right out of the bottle. Didn't want to dirty a glass. Drinking out of the bottle and cursing cancer and thinking of the ladies we have lost. To spirits who left us too soon. Other topic: My whole life I have wanted a certain dog. There are not a lot of things I have wanted. We live a pretty humble, plain life of practical choices that have to be made on one income. But ever since I was a kid, I have wanted one of these dogs. They are not overly common. I found a litter. And I really, really want a puppy. Just as I am trying to find out if I have more cancer. I want life to be simpler and have been taking care of legal stuff and giving away items, clearing out closets, paring down. And a puppy is going to simplify my life? I am terrified that if I buy this pup ($1500) I will regret it. I am terrified if I don't buy this pup, I will regret it. Normally I can make decisions in a snap and move on. They were a litter of 7. All pups are gone but two and there is no time to lose if I want one. I am not young. But I am not old and I don't know if I will get to be old and how much longer do I wait? I HATE how cancer has clouded even the simplest decisions. I know there is a big contingency of dog people here. I have always owned dogs and consider myself a good owner. I have had purebreds and mutts. I have rescued hopeless cases from the SPCA. I am alone a lot and the dogs - well, I talk to them. It bothers me to think I would die before the dog. But these dogs have only a 7 or 8 year life span. But in this case, maybe that will be a good thing? Thoughts.",

I hope to gird my loins with the intelligence and life choices I see here. Just this morning I was thinking about all the pressure for pointless positivity and how it can have the opposite effect of making you feel bad that you're feeling bad.

This is, of course, only my opinion and likely no one else's. You are angry at your daughter. Rightly so. But to disinherit her is to hate her forever from the grave. And I don't think you want to do that. I don't think you want your lasting legacy to be one of final unforgiving judgement. I read all the time of parents who, for various reasons, cut out kids who pissed them off in life. But I think it is a life sentence of having your kid feel that you hated them more than they ever knew, and it blindsides them. It hurts them deeply. And with you gone it will never, ever be resolved. It is a cruelty that a loving parent cannot, with a clear conscience, do. The thing is that while many of us here get how hurt you are and are firmly pissed off at your daughter on your behalf, you have to be a mother to get this. To get the enormity and depth of the hurt and betrayal, you have to have children and love them more than your own life. We know how discounted and discarded you feel. But here's the thing, your daughter does not get it! She is utterly, fucking clueless. A navel gazing nitwit who is the star of her own mini-drama, being queen for a day and getting married. She is NOT thinking about you because most young people literally do not have the brain capacity to see beyond the end of their own nose. If you cut her out of her inheritance and died tomorrow, she would literally have no clue why. Because right now, what you're so hurt about, she thinks it's no big deal. She loves you but she has not yet learned your value. Probably won't for a long time. And it's not just her but MANY of us have kids who have disappointed and mortified and broken us in many ways. But we don't quit loving them and we don't use our power to deny as a passive aggressive last word from the grave. So please, I beg you, give yourself some time to cool off. You would like to slap her but I do not think you are vindictive, punitive or that you want to be eternally punishing. That is simply not a legacy I think you want to leave behind. It's okay to be mad at her. I just don't think it's okay for your anger to be a permanent fist that you haul out and hit her with after your death. If your daughter was an addict who would squander her inheritance on drugs, then yes, tie her share up in a trust or something. Or, put a proviso that she does not inherit anything until she's 35 years old. That's what my father did. He did not want to leave money in the hands of young, stupid people. He wanted to be sure his kids were old enough to know the value of what they might inherit and make good choices with it. You can always hope that by 35 she's seen the light and left this guy OR she is married and her life, as insane as it seems to you, is working for her and she's happy and doing okay by her own standards. And in the end all our kids have to live their lives by their own standards, even if they make no sense to us. Micmel, take her off your power of attorney if that makes you comfortable and I can see how it would. But to take away anything she might inherit because she was a nasty cow, and I do mean this was epic, HUGE, is still not something that would make you feel good knowing how badly you can hurt her. Even though she deserves it. But it's something no one deserves. To have mom's last gesture be one of spite and hate is what she will feel until she is an old lady herself. Don't do it. Take a deep breath, a big gulp of wine, stand in the cool night air and let it wash over you. Be angry. But make no legal changes at this time. Please.",

It is so dark you cannot see your hand in front of your face. You feel alone because you cannot see if you are the only one on that vast, flat, plain alone in the complete and absolute darkness. When someone a half mile away takes their lighter out of their pocket, holds it above their head and lights it. You will see that light. No matter how deep the dark, no matter how big, one little flame will draw the eye. Light wins. You are here to be a light. No, not as a mission, not as a duty, not as a quest. Not as something you owe anybody. You are here because to someone, without you knowing it, you are that flame in the dark. You draw the eye. For your kids, your husband, your friends, you are the flickering light in their dark world that tells them, I'm not alone out here, there is someone else, I can see their light! I believe each of us is a light, in some way that we cannot know, to someone else. And that is the point. To provide a brief flicker so someone surrounded by their own darkness can see the light and breathe a sigh, I am not alone out here.",

It is exhausting to always be exhausted! I am sure you know. Lynne, yes it is hard to not give advice or ask questions. The questions, which are a form of caring and a way to stay in touch are often misread as prying and controlling. It's so hard to show that you are interested and concerned without being accused of being nosey. Minnie, our kids can break our hearts like no one can. I had doc apt yesterday. There is blood in my urine. He has ordered more tests. He tried very hard not to say he was looking for more cancer. But that is essentially exactly what he's doing. There are bears in the woods ... Trying not to freak out. Then of course I have been coughing lately and I immediately think I have lung mets. It would not occur to me that the air is thick with forest fire particulate and smoke, which it is. The moon last night was deep, deep orange, smoke moon. I will be doing several urine tests and an ultrasound for which I will likely wait 5 or more months. Ugh. ",

When I was first going through the steps to get to a diagnosis, my mind went to Hell. I maintain that you do not have to be dead to be in Hell! Your mind can take you places of pure, hopeless despair right here and now. That is where I went when this all started and to be honest, getting up every day in pain, going to bed every night with pain (in breast and armpit and ribs), I wonder what's going on. I wonder if shit isn't bubbling away in there. Spreading. So ... the brain games, the torture of mourning in advance, I get it. I truly do. I would offer advice except I don't have any. But if I could get you to do one thing, it would be to set aside all that misery, hog tie that sadness for 30 minutes, just 30 minutes and focus on your lipstick. That's right. ALL your lipstick. Put it all on the kitchen table. With a box of tissues and a mirror and some baby oil (for removing) and sit there and put on ALL your lipsticks. If you have them lipliners, eyeshadows, blush, mascara too. Put it all on! And while you are, you could, you know, do like a TV ad and make a running commentary: \"This shade, Porno Pink, is flattering to the average American housewife who likes to tend her roses in the morning and drink secretly in the laundry room in the afternoon. Porno Pink helps distract from the black bags under the eyes by neutralizing that haggard look and is frankly such an ugly colour that no one notices your eyes and instead gasps, 'good god, what happened to your mouth?' It's also always fun to get a little on your teeth, just for that shock value when you go to the grocery store.\" Then smile widely at yourself in the mirror, with lipstick on your teeth. Then apply eyeliner. Lots and lots of eyeliner. For a truly freaky look apply lipliner as eyeliner - but only if you are feeling stout hearted. Once you have applied your eyeliner like the 13 year olds do, like they have a crayon and are drawing and big, fat, circle on a piece of paper, blink at yourself in the mirror. Apply your voiceover ad work : \"We call this the smoky eye, or more accurately, Oh My God Someone Smote My Eye! This look is either very sexy or very much like you need medical attention. This look is appropriate for nowhere, ever. But if you wear this look to the grocery store, no one will notice the lipstick on your teeth.\" Then smile into the mirror with your ghoul eyes and lipstick still on your teeth. About this time, with you as cosmetically coated as you can be, Hub will walk in, stop, stare at you, searching for words as men often do when they are frightened. Say nothing. ACT NORMAL. It is perfectly normal to look like you were in the cosmetic department when a bomb went off and covered you in product. Smile at him. Let him appreciate your Porno Pink lipstick teeth. Cause this shit is sexy as hell! For just 30 minutes play dress up. The misery will be there when you get back to it. But it might not recognize you! Hugz.",

I am saddened that a friend I made while I stayed in the cancer lodge having radiation, has died. She was being radiated for uterine cancer. Then they found lung cancer and did 6 rounds of chemo. It spread and she passed this Friday. She was 86. She was a dynamo and someone I was happy to meet during that oddly suspended time of my life when I shared a residence with many others whose lives had been interrupted by this dirty disease. Today, for the first day in weeks, the forest fire smoke has cleared off and blue sky is visible. Bright and eternal. I like to think it's my friend, clearing a way for the light to get to me. NO1 2NV, the blood in my urine is not visible to the naked eye, only visible under microscope. If I was peeing out blood I could see I'd be having a stroke! The cytology blood test showed nothing sinister, which is good, because I will wait 6 months to get the ultrasound my doc ordered for 'early detection'. 6 months! He ordered it in July, I have an appointment for January 2019. It's so stupid. Hope some light gets to all of you ladies today. Hugs.",

But the mamm they took of the 'bad' boob turned up an 'hmmm, that doesn't look right, might be nothing, might be cancer, can't be sure.' So I freaked out and said I would NOT wait 6 months with cancer maybe percolating in my boob. 4 months was the suggested time wait. And today was the squish day. It went according to plan. They took pics, sent me to wait in the waiting room, still wearing that ghastly puke coloured robe, in case they need more pics. The tech walked my pics into the radiologists room then walked back out and broke with protocol. She told me, right there in the waiting room, everything the radiologist has just said. \"He reviewed the last 3 mammograms you've had and there is no change. Whatever we are seeing it is not growing and not changing. He feels this is not anything to worry about, does NOT think you need a biopsy and will see you again in 6 months. \" WOW! Normally I would have waited 3 weeks to see my doctor for that news! They never tell you anything in the mamm office but today she did. Bless her.

Reading about your pain brings back very bad memories of how incredibly painful my lumpectomy was and how suddenly the simplest things were impossible. I was practically crippled and I reacted very badly to being incapacitated. When the pain continued after I had decided it should be gone, I remember the day I broke down and cried, outside, in the horse pen, wearing my gumboots and holding a muddy stick. Ripping pain that was unrelenting just got the better of me and I bawled like a baby. Micmel, exhaustion and pain kick the legs out from under us and make us less able to withstand the regular adult daughter bullshit. On a good day her crap would likely roll right off you. But you are not having a good day and her usual behaviour goes right to your heart. Like a dart into a marshmallow. No one judges you harshly, you are messed up right now! As my friend M often says to me, you are not in your right mind. You will be. Eventually. And it can't bloody well come soon enough. My adult daughter is also armed with spears and thorns, sharp words dipped in hate, disdain and malicious, deliberate cruelty.The biggest gift that I can give as a mother is let my daughter carry the weight of her own shitty actions, decisions and beliefs. I love her, but I do not love everything about her. I love her and think we would benefit from space between us. I love her and admire her and know that there are certain things I will never do for her again. And that means that BOTH of us are getting smarter! Moms and daughters grow together if moms know when to step back, hands off and say kid, this is on you. I tell mine that I trained her once not to shit in her pants. Now any shit she finds herself in, she cleans it up herself. I am going to love her and let her figure it out herself. She can call me when she's not a moron anymore. Maybe you need to be interested in the wedding, willing to help with what she asks, but unless she asks, don't volunteer. Think of her as the tax man, doing an audit. Give what you are asked to give and don't volunteer a damn thing more, because it will be used against you!!

If no one dislikes you, you have been a doormat. And your open door, will-do-anything-for-anyone policy leaves your wife and family at extreme risk of abuse - by the hero! Neglect is abuse. Being too busy doing good for someone else is abuse. Being GONE when you need to be home is abuse. During my illness and treatment and appointments my husband was with me, but I never felt secure. I knew that it was miserable for him to be there with me because he felt he was committed to work and other things (requests by outsiders) which made me feel like a burden and bother. There was no flag firmly planted on the side of FAMILY FIRST and all others can pound sand in the face of a crisis. Breast cancer was a crisis (in my opinion) and I needed to know that he was, without reservation, without hesitation, without a second thought, willing to forsake all others and BE THERE with me in my time of need. He was. Not because his inner values made him, but because I made him. A burden and task that should never have fallen onto my shoulders at that time. But there were fights. There were times he asked if he really needed to be there because, well, someone else expected something else from him and it would relieve his own inner turmoil to please that other person and leave me on my own. He never said it in those words. But it was demonstrated in a million ways, over the past 36 years together. The COST of being one of those guys who saves the world is that a spouse has lived a shitty life of being left in the dust yet having everyone say. \"Man, your husband is the best!\" Yeah. Sure. He's just fabulous. For you. Me? I look around and he's gone because So and So needed X and Y. At this stage of my life I have less and less respect for people who will not put their foot down and draw a line where a line needs to be drawn. I do not respect people who never help and always feel that pbligations are someone else's problem. A middle ground. There has to be a middle ground and balance. My husband has absolutely ZERO of that balance and it has, over time, been an alienating distance. The only thing that I can count on is that I can't count on him. He's not bad, evil or offensive - he's just busy being all things to all people and that leaves zero time to be a dedicated spouse.",

Should have just taken a match and gasoline and saved us all days of work and trouble! It's been a rental for years and years and there is all sorts of left over mess and neglect and bad repairs. Nothing is straight, level, square or plumb. My mother came and we worked like mad for two days scrubbing everything, then Hub , Daughter and I spent another three days hauling mess out, hauling her stuff in and getting everything set up. The yard was 4 feet deep in thistle and burr and weeds and wasps. But she is mostly in, mostly settled. A few things to do, like jack the house up and pour a foundation under it, take the top floor off and set box trusses up for headroom, and install a septic tank - you know - little things. But that all can happen later. July 5 of 2017 I was starting radiation treatments. July 5 of this year I was moving my daughter into her own home. Life is weird. What I can't believe is how tired I am. I used to have energy. What the hell. All I want to do right now is go to bed. But thought I would stop in say hi and give my Micmel a big old hug. Time for beauty sleep ha ha, that's funny!",

I got to the shortcut at the top as an older lady arrives at this little path from the bottom. I waited for her to make her way up. She started, she lost her footing, she stalled and teetered. I thrust my hand out to her and she grabbed it and I braced as she got her footing and guided her up to the top. Level. Safe. That is what we do here. Hands are outstretched. Grasped.

Is your concern to convey real information without alarming anyone? Because if that is your goal ... it's the wrong goal and you will miss the mark. What I read being shared with you is that the weight and burden and impact of this disease, while often not obvious to the naked eye, is so much bigger than anyone expected. It is a battle we fight behind closed doors, after everyone has gone to school or work or to mow the lawn and we look at ourselves in the mirror and wonder who we are. Where did that other person go? What sort of future can we look forward to? Dare we even look forward to a future at all? It's learning to live knowing the rug can be yanked out from under you at any time. Or the rug has been yanked out and tough cookies for you, get up and carry on. Life and death used to be a philosophical discussion before cancer. But now it is the daily truth for so many tens of thousands of women. To convey these TRUTHS and REALITIES you have got to be willing to put pen to paper in such a way that takes all the candy coating out of it. This is hard, between the eyes, fist to the throat truth and to convey it any other way is to further misinformation and misunderstanding. You have been given and will be given more hard earned information that you can present, bare and unedited, to the world for their digestion. Or you can spin it ...and by god we've all read so much damn spinned information that we could puke. Until diagnosed I was one of the ignorant because the information fed to me through media was just too fuzzy wuzzy and unclear. Not plain. Not real. So as not to scare me. Well, too late for that. I live everyday in some degree of scared. I LIVE, SCARED, EVERYDAY and that is the truth. So. Mods. I ask. Do you have absolute editorial freedom to present your information as raw and uncut as you can? Or are you under editorial restrictions, a 'flavour' that you are expected to convey? Who has ultimate final say over HOW you put this information out there? Does this matter? Damn straight it does.",

Confession time, and this will make me sound like a shit. But it's my truth. Since being diagnosed with cancer my thoughts of the future are bleak. Frankly I don't think I have much of a future. Sure, someone is going to point at my diagnosis and quote some cheery statistics, but I don't buy it. I don't feel hopeful. I feel like I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. I look at Hub as we sit watching tv and I imagine him sitting alone. I imagine him coming home from work to a dark, empty house. I imagine him coming home from a day of snowmobiling with no one to tell his adventures to and no one to look at the boring photographs he's taken. (all snowmobiling photos look the same, snow, trees, more snow, more trees). I imagine him pushing a buggy through the grocery store, slowly, trying to figure out what to cook, asking himself what I used to make for dinner and how did I make it? These thoughts, they're a horror movie. They make me feel sick inside. Like I want to vomit up a bitter wad of poison. But then I think what if the shoe was on the other foot? What if I were watching him die? What if he had cancer and we knew it was going to come back? What if I have to live my life without him? And you know what? I have decided that dying is easier. If it comes down to the choice of outliving Hub or dying first, neither being a really great choice, but I think from a purely selfish standpoint, dying is better. I think carrying on without him would be impossible. I am 54 years old now and the first time I got in his car for a date I was 17. SEVENTEEN! We were children together. We have been together ever since. I think living with cancer in the house is like living with a known killer as a renter in your basement. No one can let their guard down. I do not want to die. But when I think about being the one left behind if the shoe was on the other foot. Nope. Don't want that either. Mags, you do not feel it when you are drowning in anxiety and all those bad feelings that haunt and terrorize you. But you are, even as you don't feel it, powering forward in such a strong way. It's not about how you feel, it's about what you do. And what you are DOING is being what women have always been; the rock solid strong ones. My heart breaks for you yet beams with pride at the same time. I hope in time you can find admiration for yourself because you've been to hell and back, yet here you stand. Respect. Respect. Micmel, I hope you DO find some kindred spirits to spend face time with. When I stayed at the cancer lodge for radiation it was very supportive to just be surrounded by people going through the very same thing. Whether we were in the lunch line-up or having coffee in the games room or watching tv, there was something about being with a bunch of people who also belonged to the cancer club that was ... restful. They were the only crowd where you didn't have to explain anything. They knew. They got it. They walked the walk. I think it will help you to find your people.",

He has a valuable resource that he has not yet had to use. That resource is your voice in his head and all our kids have it, even though we don't believe it. When he is living on his own, sitting on the toilet and reaches for the paper, only there is none, because he did not replace the roll after using the last one up ... YOUR VOICE will enter his head. The voice that nagged for years, PUT OUT A NEW ROLL WHEN YOU USE THE OTHER ONE UP! Toilet paper was a learning curve for mine when she moved out. Your son has everything he needs to be fine. Oh, he will stumble and grope and stand in the kitchen in confusion wondering how mom used to do this. But he will make his way because you have done your job. Soon instead of your voice coming into his head after a problem, he will begin reaching for your voice BEFORE there is a problem. Yes. They learn that their inner mom voice is one smart cookie! You have done your job. You may now hang up the hat and go do something else. No one can ask for more.",

I can only imagine that it was like hamburger in there! And it HURT! I had over 30 stitches in my lower bits after a difficult birth and they called the gardener in to give me an episiotomy with his garden shears, it was that epic, and it DID NOT HURT like this lumpectomy did. I stayed one night in hospital and was given Tylenol. Not even T3. Plain, old, useless as hell Tylenol. It didn't even get rid of the headache I had from having been sedated twice in a few hours. I do not consider myself a wuss, but I cried. I could not move. My breast felt like everything inside was ripping and tearing. No position was comfortable. I was in so much pain I was nauseous. I didn't sleep a wink. Pure hell. In my opinion, that was unethical. We have a standard of care we maintain when treating our farm animals and we do not allow pain like that to go untreated. In fact, I seriously considered going out to the tack shed and helping myself to a little of the horse pain meds, THAT stuff would have made sure I didn't feel anything for about 6 days! But I told Husband that if the surgeon said I needed more surgery because the margins weren't clear, and if I said, \"Like hell I will!\" partly it would be her fault for the absolute crap job she did of pain management. Because that is their responsibility. I wonder how many people refuse important treatments because of how badly they were managed first time around? Doctors and hospitals should HEAR about this. They are selling a service, you are the client, they get paid for what they do and if they do a bad job, they need to know. No one needs to be rude, but I did tell my surgeon that I was not happy with this aspect of my care, because it didn't feel like care at all. I am sorry this happens to anyone.

Figuring that if this was a cancer cough an antihistamine would not help it. So I took ONE LOUSY TABLET and I have not coughed since! I kid you not! I think it's like Luckynumber said and my airways got irritated in last year's fire season and just stayed irritated. Doesn't help that we heat with an old wood furnace that belches huge amounts of smoke and particulate into the household air! This year when the province is on fire, as seems to be the norm these days, I am going to take an antihistamine and prevent that whole cycle of irritated airway from even starting. I suspect (but cannot confirm) that the radiation damage to my lung has predisposed me to not being able to recover from small insults to the airways like I used to. To anyone iwth that miserable, intermittent, pointless hacking cough - try an antihistamine. If it works or not will help direct you to your next steps! Thanks all!",
