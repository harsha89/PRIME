She said 75%. It was indeed malignant. The needle biopsy had already been scheduled for following week. ETA: Radiologist said tumor would need to be removed even if benign because of the vascular activity and other factors.",

By end of rads, area underneath breast was blistering, peeling, oozing, cracked open and bleeding. Was put on oral antibiotics and narcotic pain relief. Underneath breast area mostly healed within two weeks. However, entire area across breast now even more severely damaged than underneath breast. Still on oral antibiotics and narcotic pain relief. My bra sticks to skin when try to remove it so I use nonstick pads inside bra at work. Makes me wince to see it. Radiation oncologist recommended going topless, but I'm pretty sure that violates firm's dress code :) At home I do go braless with open shirt. I sleep topless too, but the skin sometimes sticks to sheets. I can only take the narcotic pain relievers at night since they put me in a sleepy stupor. In last few days, I have also sharp electric-like jolts of pain in two places in breast and armpit that interfere with sleep even after taking narcotic pain relief. I do not understand the apparently uneven rate of damage to different radiated areas since radiation delivered all at same time. Now the side and armpit area are beginning to show same symptoms: blistering, peeling, oozing. No cracks and bleeding yet though. Yesterday radiation oncologist told me all damage should heal within 4-6 weeks. Ouch!",
