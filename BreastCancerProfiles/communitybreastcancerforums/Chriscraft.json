We are struggling with telling our family especially our grown children. Our daughter is in college and our son is in the process of buying his first home. As of now, noone in our family is aware. We don't want them to worry. We are doing enough of that on our own. If it isn't B9 and it isn't an aggressive treatment we are considering waiting a month which will allow family members in Florida to get home and allow our son to enjoy the excitement of moving in to his first home. Our son is very compassionate and the news if bad will hit both our children obviously hard. I'm not sure if waiting to tell them is a mistake. We want to protect those we love but will waiting cause more harm then good? My mom died from cancer when I was my daughter's age now which I'm praying our daughter will not lose hers. This is so difficult... My head is spinning.... Emotions are everywhere. Any advice would be great.... Sorry for rambling Log in to post a reply",

Luckynumber47, if the results are not what we are praying for I'm leaning towards waiting so our son and his wife can enjoy the excitement of moving into their new home. Did your boys understand eventually?",
