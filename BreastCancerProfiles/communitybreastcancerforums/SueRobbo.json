    "Content": "Oct 18, 2018 04:21AM - edited Oct 18, 2018 04:27AM by SueRobbo I'm post menopausal Aged 66 when treated with FEC T (Epirubicin and docetaxel), 6 rounds administered every 3 weeks over an 18 week period) My hair was a fine silver and shoulder length. Very full and shiny with a lot of bounce. I'm 6 months post chemo and my hair is a mass of fine white curls on top; the back and sides are very thin, with my scalp clearly visible. The hair directly over my ears, and around the nape of my neck is a hilarious pie crust frill of tiny white curls. My hair fell out 2 weeks after the first chemo. I developed dry eyes. My eyelashes, all other bodily hair and nails fell out mid way between the first and second docetaxel. My face became very sore and scabbed over, forming painful pustules. My Hospital has since withdrawn FEC T chemo due to adverse side effects. I was told the cost of cold capping was Â£1,500 to the UK NHS and so declined it, but I wish I had been more forceful in asking for it, as my experience has been if you don't ask you don't get. Apart from Alopecia, I have chemo induced peripheral neuropathy in hands and feet, weak and broken nails, weight-loss, and extreme dry eyes that make prolonged reading impossible. The veins in my cannula arm have painful chemo damage. Alopecia is upsetting, and I realise that is the focus of this thread, however the pain from peripheral neuropathy is ever present and I stumble frequently, which has caused complete lack of confidence when going out. I can wear a wig for my Alopecia although I am concerned about the cost of doing so long term). I'm 6 months post chemotherapy and on Accord brand of letrozole (although prescribed Femara due to comorbidities, my dispenser won't give it due to cost). I do know other people locally prescribed Femara for no other reason than the side effects are considered to be less. This makes me feel worthless at times, although I realise I mustn't give into it. I'm finding the side effects of letrozole seriously debilitating (pains in bones and stiff limbs that make walking painful, sleep disturbances due to hip pain, nausea and stomach cramps, headaches and blurred vision). I've all but given up driving due to the latter. I've recently made arrangements privately to see a dermatologist with regards to my Alopecia as my Hospital have told me a) my hair would have thinned anyway due to my age, b) hair will come back, c) it isn't anything they've done, d) my hair looks nice. The usual rubbish answers I gather.   ",
