She had a mastectomy and went through extensive chemotherapy. She went into remission and was informed 17 years later that it had recurred. Her doctor first started her on Hormone therapy and remained on that for about 3 years. She took the injection for a short time before he changed her to Xeloda. She has been on this for about 6 months. She takes it 3 weeks on and 1 week off. She is scheduled to go back to the doctor next week. When it recurred, it came back in the lining of her lungs and has slowly progressed into the lymph nodes in her neck. She is a registered nurse and has to have her hands and feet to be able to do her job. So, those of you that have taken it can understand how this has been a torturous few months. He has slowly been reducing her dosage because he is calling her \"toxic\" and her side effects are steadily getting worse. I have been down the cancer road once before with my mother in law who lost her battle to another cancer - and I know that her options are running out. She truly enjoys her job and so many hobbies that use her hands - quilting, yard work, crocheting, etc.... Her fingers on her left hand are numb now. She has lost the nails on both of her big toes.  He told her that he would stop the dosage when she couldn't put an I.V. in when a patient is in the hospital..... Can anyone tell me that has used Xeloda and has experienced numbness, did they ever get their feeling back in their fingers. She has stated that she is getting tired of not feeling good. I love my mother very much and I want her to be able to enjoy life. I want her to be able to enjoy the things that she loves. I don't want her to go through this and lose the ability do do those things that she loves to do the most.  Can anyone tell me anything about this drug?  My prayers are that the struggles that she has faced during these last six months has helped. She will get a PET scan after this appointment and sometime before her appointment in October. Then we will all know if it helped at all......  Mom had stage 4 BC. Metastasis to pleura, peritoneum, lymph nodes, brain, and spinal cord. Amazingly strong-courageous. As some call her-\"one tough cookie\" Log in to post a reply",

She received treatment that was really unheard of then and went into remission until 2005. She received treatment after treatment until I lost her in December 2013. While I knew there was always the chance and so many times while she was so sick - I asked God to give it to me to take away my mother's pain....I never thought I would really be facing the possibility. I have done mammograms for years and self-checked and rechecked between mammograms. I have never found a lump in all of the years that I have been doing this. Around March 6, I noticed a bloody discharge in my left breast - which is also retracted. I didn't think about it at first. I have never felt a lump and I just had a mammogram less than a year ago. I didn't think it could be anything. The discharge continued and I have had an itch (on the inside-don't know how to explain the sensation) and I went to the dr on March the 9. (9's have not been my family's friend this year - my brother attempted suicide Jan 9 (which I am still mad about because so many people want to live and he wants to take his life...are you kidding me!!), he received an electrical burn on Feb 9, and I found out that this discharge could be something on March 9). My GP scheduled an MRI at a cancer facility that happened late Friday and now I wait for the results. It could mean more testing....or surgery....or who knows. They said until the images are read, there is no way to know what the next step will be. One other question that I have is I read people posting about milk \"letting down\" or something to that effect. What does that mean? I know we are all different and have different symptoms...I just want to know that that even means. Since this discharge has started, I have a sensation of leakage and there won't be anything there. Anyway - this is my story and I will be waiting for a phone call today or tomorrow to know my next step. Mom had stage 4 BC. Metastasis to pleura, peritoneum, lymph nodes, brain, and spinal cord.
