If you have time take it.  I was told I did not -too agressive.  I did take a vacation prior and put off 1st lumpectomy by 3 weeks as I wanted to enjoy life.  I had 2 vacations planned and my Onc worked them around my chemo, cruises are wonderful. I would like to have put off the last cruise too close to finishing chemo, counts came back 4 days before we left, I felt weak and ended up getting sick from everyone else, Feb.  I was 5 weeks out before counts came back.  Try to look at the surgerys as your me time (time to take a much needed nap) and have something to look forward to & focus on it, your reward for all that you will go through, I think that is what helped me the most.  You will get through this, I had things happen that I didn't expect and the worst part so far is neuropathy still and hair is not growing very fast.  Chemo day was my day to relax, it was a day I knew I did not HAVE to work and the nurses waited on me gave me carrots and lots of water and warm blankets.  The only time I could eat raw veggies. So for me a positive experience.  It was a chance to get implants and learn so much about all of this.  Kaiser has \"Gummy\" implants, I have them!!!  So ask if you want them, they are wearing in nicely feel natural and I only notice them if I open a very heavy door, they are very light and when I swim they feel natural, not like the TE's and I loved my TE's!  FYI, gummys are silicone that are like a gummy bear in that they will not leak.  Hope this helps to calm you.",

Good luck with your decision.",

Happy thoughts and you will do fine.  I have gone back to work full time after all surgeries and treatment, not a shortened schedule.  Having something to look forward to at the end I think has helped too. ",
