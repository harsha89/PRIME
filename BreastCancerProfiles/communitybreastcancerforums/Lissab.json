My question is I had my sentinel lymph node test right before they did my double mastectomy. What exactly will do on her procedure. When do we find out results. My family found out after my surgery in waiting room. Has anyone else done theirs day before surgery? Is difference bc hers is lumpectomy not mastectomy?
