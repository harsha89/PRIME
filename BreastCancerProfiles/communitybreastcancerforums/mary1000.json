The disconcerting part of the experience was the attending physician who was \"supervising.\"  He had the data from my previous tests all wrong \"oh I didn't notice those results\"--the results on which the recommendation for the biopsy was made), his thinking seemed disjointed, the resident kept having to call his name to get his attention, and he was somewhat rude.   Eg, I asked him (only question to him), what the triangular shape of the mass might mean.  His response \"That it is a triangle.\"  I paused, then asked whether a triangular lesion would be considered an irregular shape (which I know isn't as good as a regular shape.)  His response, \"oval and round are regular, so triangular is irregular\" which was OK, but uttered in a tone of how could you be so stupid. I think medical professionals don't realize how debilitating this kind of behavior is--or the resident knew it, and the attending did not.  I never want to see this man again, in any part of my treatment, if treatment proves necessary. I am so sorry that so many of you experienced pain--I'm sure that was worse.  Good luck to you. ",

      "Content": "Jul 7, 2008 01:04PM - edited Jul 7, 2008 01:08PM by mary1000 Hi!  I hope everyone is doing well.  I am thankful to say my biopsy was benign.  In case it might be helpful to any of you, I wanted to write a few observations/things I have learned for those of you who are also fortunate enough to have a benign biopsy, which I hope is everyone.. The core needle biopsy site didn't hurt until 2 days after the biopsy (June 30).  A week later I have a lump at the biopsy site, within my breast, achy and slightly painful.  So far as i know this is not abnormal, and I do not seem to have an infection, but I called today to ask (of course you cannot speak to the radiologist, but you can speak to someone who will speak to the radiologist!) , and they will get back to me tomorrow.  I would be nice to have an information sheet at the end of the biopsy--it would be reassuring. I've learned that it is very important to get a copy of your pathology report, which I hope to receive soon.  The breast center won't give it to you, but your personal physician will.  Then i plan to get an explanation of the types of histology found:  Some types of benign findings increase your cancer risk a lot, some raise it somewhat, some don't raise it much or not at all.  All are called benign, so it's important to know which you have. It's important to have the original referring radiologist correlate the  biopsy findings with the mammogram and or ultrasound and the clinical finding (eg, palpable lump, no palpabe lump,  etc.)  To see if all make sense together.  This is the so called \"triple test\" and is much more accurate than the pathology report alone. It's important to find out what the followup should be.  For example, many places believe that standard of care is to get a mammogram 6 mos after a benign finding (I think in part to get a new baseline mammogram that shows what the healed tissue looks like, in case problems arise later.) I think the work was well done in my case, but the communication from the breast center has been not so good, a struggle.  I have to say that my gyn and PCP have been wonderful.  I think people at breast center are well intentioned, but busy, and they have not established a standard protocol for communication.  We women should fight for this, as lack of communication raises anxiety horribly (or, at least, it raised mine.)  Of course they don't get reimbursed for communicating. Good luck, and thanks for comments. ",
