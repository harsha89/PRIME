The traditional clinical trial system is old, expensive and painfully slow. I-Spy2 trials have been around for a few years (it's mentioned in a few different forum threads) and offered at ~20 locations around the US, with the lead site at UCSF in San Francisco, CA. Here's a quick glimpse of how ISPY2 works: I-SPY 2 is an Innovative public-private collaboration that combines Personalized Medicine & Novel Trial Design to develop new cancer treatments much faster and for much less cost",

This tyrosine kinase inhibitor is historically been under investigation for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer, but is showing benefit for TNBC in the I-Spy2 trials. 2. MK-2206, an AKT inhibitor. When added to trastuzumab (Herceptin), it improved the pathologic complete response rate (pCR) 3. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), a checkpoint inhibitor which falls under the umbrella of Immunotherapy, is generating durable responses in a variety of cancers. It's being added to HER2-specific kinase inhibitors and generating benefit for HER2+ patients.",

This link will explain the Oncotype DX Test: The Oncotype Test ** One thing that interests me is how accurate this test has been of predicting recurrence. Is there anyone who scored low (under 18) on oncotype that later had distant recurrence? --------------------------------- For those that are curious, here's the breakdown for Oncotype scoring: Recurrence Score lower than 18: The cancer or DCIS has a low risk of recurrence. The benefit of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer or radiation therapy for DCIS is likely to be small and will not outweigh the risks of side effects. Recurrence Score between 18 and 31: The cancer or DCIS has an intermediate risk of recurrence. It\u2019s unclear whether the benefits of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer or radiation therapy for DCIS outweigh the risks of side effects. Recurrence Score greater than 31: The cancer or DCIS has a high risk of recurrence, and the benefits of chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer or radiation therapy for DCIS are likely to be greater than the risks of side effects.",

Regardless, the test results allowed us to precede forward with the proper treatments.",

Being \"Stage 2\" is too broad of a statement to make any conclusions though. It may very well be 7%. There are so many variables and different subtypes. It's best to determine the specifics of your tumor characteristics from FINAL pathology and use that data to draw comparisons, which is challenging due to the genomic variations science continues to uncover. Based on my very simplistic and crude research, I get the feeling that the number is higher than 7%. Perhaps as high as 20% progress from Stage 2 to Stage 4. (Essentially, 2 out of 10). Successful surgery removes the tumor, but the medical community is still trying to figure out why some metastasize, while others don't. You need to understand the complicated steps of cell metastasis, how it spreads, etc. (Local invasion, intravasation, circulation via bloodstream, extravasation, proliferation, angiogenesis, etc). There are a number of companies trying to answer this question and building diagnostic tests that will determine who will progress and who won't. I have no idea when these will be clinically available, nor how accurate they will be. You also need to understand drug resistance and why it happens. There's a litany of other things beyond my understanding that deals with metastatic progression. Some of the good news is that those that do progress continue to live long lives, due the advancements in medicine, making positive lifestyle changes, etc. It's an interesting question that probably most folks here have strong thoughts and opinions on. I will add this to \"My Favorite Topics\", since I'm always curious to hear other viewpoints.",

These companies will test for HER3 mutations (all referred as \"ERBB3\"): 1. University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. [800-256-0893] They offer the UW-OncoPlex - Cancer Gene Panel - which tests 234 genes. It costs ~$2250. You have the option of getting just the ERBB3 gene tested for $1500, which is silly, since $750 more gets the other 233 genes tested. 2. Foundation Medicine in Cambridge, Massachusetts [888-988-3639] They have the pan-cancer test called FoundationOne - which tests 315 genes. It costs ~$5800. 3. Quintiles in Durham, North Carolina [866-267-4479] They have the Quintiles Comprehensive Cancer Panel (QCCP) - which tests 223 genes. Cost is unknown, since I couldn't get a live person on the phone. 4. Genome Explorations, a division of Compass Lab Services in Memphis, Tennessee [901-348-5774] They have the GenOnc Cancer Panel 4 Comprehensive - which tests for 160 genes. There's more companies that test for this and will edit this post as I find them. My challenge is getting past the confusion of HER3 staining vs. HER3 mutation testing. Without a medical background, it's tough to navigate/understand the jargon, especially when it revolves around the constantly shifting landscape of genomics. Hope this helps someone.",

When I saw that you were just diagnosed, my initial thought was to suggest seeking treatment at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania since they have the only research team in the US that is studying Lobular. They are conducting the first ever and only US-based ILC clinical trial (which I wrote about here). It's specifically for \"newly diagnosed\" patients like yourself who haven't had surgery yet. The 3-4 week clinical trial is designed to determine treatment response by testing a few different common breast cancer therapies to identify areas of Lobular drug resistance. Drug resistance is a bit of a challenge and ILC is a chronically understudied, poorly understood subtype that warrants different targeted treatment. The trial hopes to answer some fundamental questions, which are needed to change treatment guidelines that will ultimately improve survival for all ILC patients. Hope this makes sense.

You wrote: \"I saw breast cancer doctor today she could clearly see even in artificial light the indentation and could feel lumps, but said it was lobular tissue\" What is your doctor referring to when they say \"lobular tissue\"? I've never heard of that term and I've been researching lobular breast cancer everyday since my wife was diagnosed with ILC in April 2014. To me, \"lobular tissue\" means lobular breast cancer, but assume they are referring to something else. In terms of the indentation, my wife discovered her breast cancer by the physical \"dimpling\" (indentation) that you have described. She could also feel a palpable lump (if I recall, it was about the size of a green pea). Feeling this lump is slightly unusual since ILC lacks a sticky protein called Ecadherin. Without this protein, the cells have a harder time forming a lump and instead the cancer grows in lines. Another member of the forum accurately described Lobular this way: \"Lobular is so hard to detect initially as it starts growing as delicate fern fronds, and only when big enough gets sufficient density in the middle that it shows on a scan - sort of like palm of hand, with frondy fingers - which is why when they actually do surgery, they are frequently surprised by the larger size, as the extensiveness of the fronds don't show until you are in there\". In terms of diagnostic detection, this characteristic growth makes Mammograms and Ultrasounds ineffective at detecting Lobular. This was the case with my wife. However, the digital MRI revealed her lobular cancer and estimated it to be about 1.8 cm. After surgery, final pathology revealed it to be 2.2 cm, which is fairly close to the MRI size estimate. Here's the data that supports the use of MRI's for Lobular. July 2015 Article: \"Lobular breast cancer series: imaging\" excerpt from article: \"Studies have repeatedly shown that MRI is superior to conventional imaging, not only in terms of its increased sensitivity for detecting ILC, but also for the detection of ipsilateral and contralateral disease\" [30]\u2013[32]. Citation sources: 30: Abstract: \"Evaluating the impact of preoperative breast magnetic resonance imaging on the surgical management of newly diagnosed breast cancers.\" 31: Abstract: \"Accuracy and surgical impact of magnetic resonance imaging in breast cancer staging: systematic review and meta-analysis in detection of multifocal and multicentric cancer.\" 32: Abstract: \"MR imaging of the ipsilateral breast in women with percutaneously proven breast cancer\". I hope I don't make you more paranoid. In the end, you are doing the right thing by asking for the MRI and I support your vigilance. Feel free to visit the ILC section of the forum, if you have questions.",
