My lymph node was abnormal looking according to the radiologist and tomorrow I go in to get a biopsy done of the lymph node. Then I will go and get a biopsy done of the scab on my nipple later this week. The good news is nothing was abnormal on the breast itself. Anyone have a situation where the lymph node was swollen and abnormal looking on an ultrasound? Thanks for all of the kind thoughts. Alyssa",

I went to the doctor on Friday with a swollen lymph node in my armpit as well as pain from under my armpit to the center of my breast. I also have a round scab on my nipple. All of this on the the right side. Since I am young my doctor scheduled an ultrasound on Monday, and depending on the results they may do a mammogram. On Thursday I have a follow up with my doctor and then she is referring me have a biopsy done of the scab that is on my nipple. I am not breastfeeding so I just don't understand how all of a sudden I could get a scab and I have an on and off burning pain on the nipple. My doctor did an exam and did not feel any lumps and seemed unsure and somewhat worried but tried to make me feel like I shouldn't worry. I am young (27) but I have a family history of breast cancer and my grandma also had it young. I wish it was Monday and I could already have the results of the ultrasound because not knowing and just wondering is driving me crazy. Has anyone else had a similar experience?Â  Thanks!

I don't have much longer until my ultrasound but then waiting for the results and then my biopsy. I try not to think about it but it is hard. Wishing the best to you and your results. Alyssa",
