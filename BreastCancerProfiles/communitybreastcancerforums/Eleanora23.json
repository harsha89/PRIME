Would like to be as informed as possible for two upcoming medical ONC visits. Gotta get this treatment started ! Thanks!

Been to tired to pursue this and none of my health care team would look twice at this report a year+ ago when I was diagnosed (except my intial breast surgeon, who ran the report, cost my insurance a bundle of $$, then handed me the report stating in big red l RISK\" during an early visit before surgery, then refused to discuss the test with me at all. Needless to say she didn't remain my surgeon. Had the bedside manner of Darth Vadar. Once in a while the thought of this report rears its ugly head and I want to get to the bottom of it. ALso want Agendia to be fully informed about what this surgeon does...runs their test without actually using it or responding to questions about it. Peace. ",

MY HER2+ status was \"up in the air\" as the intial pathology based on FISH was HER+ but then the mammaprint test came back HER- I had a my initial breast surgeon state that I was HER-, based on the mammaprint being more sensitive than the FISH. At my visit with the oncologist today, he said the the HER+ FISH result was the gold standard and actually due to that he never would have ordered a mammaprint (nor would be in the future order ONCA) as he has faith in the FISH assessment and is sure the HER+ status is good. Clearly this affects so much of the treatment plan. He said give the HER2+ he is suggesting very strongly that I do chemotherapy. I am just wondering any others that could she light on this, have had similar experiences, or just know of good, solid links to advice about this. I am stage 1 at this point, waiting for a partial MX in a few weeks. (For some reason my diagnosis information is not showing below. Thanks for your input and support.

I will indeed need to pursue the discrepancy, as all treatment decisions are based on HER 2+ or not. I am thinking now that when I get a biopsy from my lumpectomy (scheduled to see the breast surgeon tomorrow to hopefully finally schedule the surgery) that I can figure out an alternative lab to send the excised tumor to for another set of results. I will discuss this tomorrow with the breast surgeon.  Phalia, I am sorry to hear of your confusing and conflicting results. It makes everything so much more stressful doesn't it. I am curious as to what that next step is for you...another test beyond the ONCATYPE? Moderators: Hi. I see that you often chime in the posts of newer folks like me to help guide us to the best spot to post here so any intervention is appreciated. THanks.  ",
