I have really been defeated by this this go around.  The onc wanted to admit me to the hospital, but I have no one to take the kids for me, so we are doing this as outpatient at her office.  I am starting to feel better tonight, thank goodness.  My onc is going to reduce the tx by 10% next time to see if that helps with the severe ab cramping.  She also prescribed diflucan for the thrush, magic mouthwash for the sores and bentyl for the ab cramps.  I have been using biotene faithfully, gargaling with baking soda, salt and water 6 times per day.  I guess I will try the ice cube thing.  Could the sores also come from the length of time for the meds to be given?  Would extending the drip/push time help?  Just wondering. Here's to minimal se's for those who recently had treatment and those with one coming soon. Sorry to gripe, but maybe someone has some suggestions for me.  Tina",

Tommorrow is my first tx, so long as onc thinks my incision is healed enough.  It looks much better than it did when it busted open saturday night and the drainage is very minimal now.  My mind is not racing so much about the tx, but more about the disease and my lack of family and friend support (parents dead from cancer and friends have all moved away because of the job market.)  I miss my parents so much, I have been without my mom since 21 yo, I am 34 and lost dad in Aug 06 kinda quickly.  I really need them right now and that has really been bothering me tonight.  I don't think it helps that my onc was my fathers as well and it brings back the horrible memories.  I have been wondering all night, if I will \"sit in his chair\" tomorrow.  I don't know, I feel like I'm rambling, I don't mean to be a downer.  I have been so busy and tired from the 3 surgeries, but tonight the idleness has really gotten to me.  Big day ahead of me tomorrow.  First tx, then to the wig store and then wal-mart for last minute things I forgot about to make this weekend smoother.  If it weren't for the boys sleeping, I probably would have went now to get the stuff.  As for the wig shopping...the girl who does my hair (used to be my clubbing buddy back in the day, but she is now married and settled down) and I were supposed to go together.  BUT, and I swear Murphy and his law have a secret hiding place in my house, she was pregnant and went into labor 3 weeks early, yep you guessed it, labor pains Friday night, baby born Saturday a.k.a. wig shopping day!  So, now I will be going by myself, but called the store yesterday and set up with the Manager my own session with her.  Problem is, I have no idea what I want.  I thought I found on one the internet, emailed it to Carolyn - my hairdresser - she said \"Oh, Tina, that looks soooo 80's.\"  So, I will need all the help I can get from the store manager.  Well, this has probably been long enough....sorry about that.  I hope everyone has a great day tomorrow, I feel a bit better already, I even yawned...yeehaw!

So, now I am at work.  I work at a residential facility for male juvenile offenders (ages 14 to 18) I was worried at first a couple of weeks ago about coming in bald, but since then a lot of the kids have found out about my illness and have been so supportive.  So, I came to work in the hat and it's been 1 1/2 hours and it's already starting to get hot and humid (I live in Florida) so off with the hat and here I sit at my desk bald bald!  I feel good about it and I know it's not for everybody, but I wish that it is as easy for the rest of you as it has been for me.

Then I went to the wig shoppe, found a cute bob looking thing, but need someone else to verify it is not another relic from the 80's LOL. Then to Wal-mart, then straightening at the house, pick up youngest son, then finish my oldest son's \"The Digestive System\" project with him and now onto you guys. So, my next question, I have to have the Neulasta shot tomorrow, do I take Claritin as a preventative tonight or what? PS the onc gave me some Lunesta, so I am planning on getting some good ZZZZ's tonight...I hope.  I am going on 40 hour now and I'm still in rambling on and on and on mode.

I don't care what anyone at the infusion center says, I am sucking on ice chips, popsicles, whatever it takes next time to prevent this you can bet your bottom dollar! One final note, if anyone is hesitant about Neulasta, I am hear to testify that it is a great thing.  My count (white blood, I think is what it is) was 1.1 on wedneday and today it was 9.  Amazing, it's one of the reasons I'm feeling so much better.  I can just imagine what would have happened if I had not had the shot the day after tx, I probably would have had no choice but to be hospitalized for what I just went through...  Just my two cents.

One question, the Emend that they gave me says to take one hour before chemo.  Should I take it with me, since I have to have lab work and see the doc first or should I take it before I leave the house.  I called the onc office this morning, but I had to leave a message and \"worry wart\" me is paranoid that I won't get the call at work as I am in and out of my office so much during the day and out in the boonies, so cell service doesn't work out here. I'm rambling, I think it might be those pills I took.  Boy, do I feel like I'm typing at light speed. Tina",

Anyway, not complaining, just giving background.  I truly hope I am on that first category as well, if not I will have to take it as it comes I guess.  I have talked to my boss about working from home, but he has to talk with corporate about that...we'll see.   I am trying to keep a positive outlook on this whole thing.  This has happened to me for a reason and it is my duty to do the best with it that I can. Thanks again for your post.  Have a wonderful Mother's Day!!",

      "Content": "May 23, 2008 05:44AM - edited May 23, 2008 05:45AM by gogators I too am 34, and just had my first tx yesterday and went wig shopping afterward.  Unfortunately, I went by myself, my hairdresser had a baby the morning of our scheduled shopping trip, just my luck.  Anyway, I found some really cute styles, I called the manager of the store the day before I was going in told her that I am a cancer patient and needed help, she was wonderful.  When I got there, she knew who I was when I walked in the door.  We tried on many styles, I find that I like the monofilament styles much more than the cheaper versions, they really look so much more natural.  Also, even if you are going to buy online, go to a store to try on styles, something that looks cute on the internet model, may not look cute on you.  However, if you don't have that option, make sure you check into return policies, some places have restocking fees. Also, check with your insurance co., they may reimburse you if you have a script for a cranial prosthesis.  Mine reimburses at 80%.  So the $260 wig, was marked down and then she gives all cancer patients 15% off as well, so once I get reimbursed (after someone else goes with me to make sure it looks good) it will only come out to about $20-30 bucks out of pocket.  I am also looking at wiglets, that are half wigs you can wear under a baseball cap or any hat really, but I live in SW Florida, it gets hot and humid here and with summer sporting activities with my sons being outside without a hat is not good! I hope that gave you some insight, I'm still flying high from the steriods I have to take, so I apologize if I've rambled! Take care, Tina",
