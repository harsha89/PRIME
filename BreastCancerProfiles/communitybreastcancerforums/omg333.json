I also had not had a mammo for over 10 years.....last month, I was soooo nervous, then when i had it done, i thought it hurt a bit.....then i got a call back, needed 3 more because of some clusters that were found......this time, even though it was tougher, i rode it out like a pro! Now, i say to myself....bring it on!!! And i truly mean that! Yes, the tech is kinda right in your face positioning the breast, i used a lot of breath spray the second time around... The very best to you! ",
