Here is the report from the ultrasound: Hypoechoic area at the axillary tail in the left breast. Small hypoechoic nodular apprearing area with shadowing suggested at axillary tail. (.51 x .47 x .53 centimeters) No demonstration of cyst, ductal dilation, or vascular abnormality identified. B-rad category 0 = incomplete.  I am just so scared and don't have my diagnostic until Monday.",
