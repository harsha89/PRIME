But the Onco type result terrifies me.It's the only thing I've cried about.Had an uncle with metastatic lung CA. My nodes were neg.but had invasion of lympho vascular bed. There is so little info about this.Genomic owns the test and the only research.That research is based on Tamoxifen tx only and the test has only been used since 2008.Not enough people yet to answer your question. Basic theory is throw everything at it, maybe it will work. I do feel assurance that it may help but for right now I'm just terrified and not ready for any of this. Also praying my side effects of chemo are not permanant. And will pray for you too.",

I trust that my teatments will cover me. I've done all they told me to do and now I pray and live life. I've met and read about so many women whose disease has been more advanced and they go on and on for many years and of course many teatments. It is amazing though how long people live with treatment.GOD BLESS YOU and in all your suffering may PEACE surround you!",
