(Medicare and Cigna) The chemoembolization followed by the Afinitor/Aromasin combo resulted in a huge drop in my markers, which are very accurate for me. Scans are scheduled for next month. My Interventional Radiologist told me that chemoembolization has been around in the US for a long time, techniques improving all the time.  You may want to check it out.",

I did pretty good.  I was given Zofran and Decadron in the hospital, stayed over night and went home next day. The worst side effects for me were flu like aches & pains, and of course pain in the liver area.  I was on Dilaudid for pain in the hospital and that was it.  I had the nurse load me up right before I went home.  Once home I had a script for dilaudid and zofran but didn't use either one.  Still took a week and a half before I felt good enough to go out. Just got cleared and scheduled for the second lobe this morning.  So next week I do it all over again on Tuesday.  I feel it is worth it.......  From there it's on to Navelbine.  Sending hugs your way  ",

Got a year reprieve with Falsodex.  Recently I've been on low dose Xeloda for about 14 months, hormonals not working. New progression.  Onc is going to try adding back the Avastin to the Xeloda to see if it will help manage the mets better.    Since it was working when I quit last time we are hoping it will work again.  Anyone been through this?  We are going to try this before going to the big guns chemo.  Guess time will tell.

Medicare paid and it wasn't all that bad.  Chemo went directly to liver, with beads.  After 2 weeks, the first lobe already showed shrinkage. Then second lobe was done.  Scans won't be done till early July, so I won't have any real news until then.  Just thought I'd pass this along.  ",

My 2 favorites are by Raquel Welch.  My hairdresser styled them for me.  The most I paid for the RW was $125.  The one I like the least is the expensive one. After searching all over for reasonably priced scarves I ended up buying them on ebay.  A former cancer patient makes them and sells them in lots of colors and patterns.  I bought 4, over time. They range from $14 - $18 each (more for silk). They are cotton and are made like a cap with elastic and ends that tie in the back, so they look like a scarf.  They stay on and are comfortable.  I wear them at home.   Hope this helps ",
