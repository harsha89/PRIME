Be patient and kind to yourself. Your body went through a lot of trauma, and it needs to rest and heal. I thought I would feel terrible forever, but before I knew it three months went by and I feel great! Take it day-by-day, and know that soon you will have more good days than bad. it will happen, I promise!",
