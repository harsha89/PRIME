I did a quick wikipedia search on Bramwell as I wasn't familiar with it. Sounds like it might need to be my British period fix since my Downton Abbey has left me for a year after only doling out 7 measley episodes for the entire year of 2013. I had ct scans today and am trying not to throw up when I think about what the results could be. Trying to play it cool till I can call my MO in a few days requesting results. Hoping your treatment continues to be good to you, and hoping that next time, he'll have that magic wand at the ready. (Love your new avatar by the way)",

Unfortunately, I had that one removed because I thought I was cured. Ha! My second port was put in 10/11. I had a lot of issues with it not working well, and they often had to use what I call the \"roto rooter\". It must clot at the end of the tube, and no matter how many pretzel acrobats I do, they can't get a return from it. The roto rooter flush usually works in clearing out whatever is blocking it. That port became infected and had to be removed 11/12 and a new port was placed. It worked well until a month or two ago. Now, they often can't get a blood return again - although the chemo goes in fine. (It's just like a man -  it takes, but doesn't give much in return ;-)    I hope this isn't deja vu as I'm running out of spots to put a port!  The technical term used in my medical report re: the roto rooter: 10 cc NS and 5 cc 100 U/ml Heparin. It stays in the line for 30 minutes, and then a bloodflow can usually be elicited. I get my chemo 2 Fridays on - one Friday off, so it's not going long periods without use. I hope it at least keeps receiving for a very long long long time!",

I live in downstate Illinois and visit Chicago once or twice a year. I drive there and then park my car and take public transportation as it's easier and cheap. Chicago has a great transit system. Very user friendly, and the ride from the airport to the downtown area is safe. You could call the CTA and ask them to mail you a map of their train/bus system. You'll receive one in about a week. You can also purchase a one day or 3 day CTA pass which allows you to use their buses and el trains unlimited for that period of time. Great way to get around in the city.  ",

They did have to back me off a few times over the course of treatment to my current regime of every 3 weeks due to low platelets and wbc, but I'm very fortunate that it's kept me stable. I also had zometa infusions at the same time as a bone strengthener, and I was having flu symptoms with the combo of all those together, so now my Zometa infusion is a week after the gem/carb, and it's worked well to separate them out.  Recently had a problem though, and am hoping someone here will have words of wisdom for me:   I'm pasting in a post that I wrote in another forum because I\"m too lazy to re-write it:  My gemzar/carboplatin combo may soon be at an end. I've been getting these infusions since March 2013 - then suddenly, midstream through my carbo last Friday, I started having an allergic reaction - breathing got very tight. Hands and feet were burning. Face flushed - my BP and Pulse went way up, and oxygen went down to 88. I've seen the nurses in there rush around for a patient before, but this time, it was my turn. They quickly stopped the carbo and started fluids and benadryl. That got it back under control, but apparently, that often happens - suddenly you become allergic to the carboplatin. My onc. is going to try it again in 3 weeks with benadryl as a pre-med, but I'm already very nervous about it repeating. From what I've read on dr. google - once you have that reaction (which can quickly go into anaphylactic shock or respiratory arrest), you'll remain allergic to it. I've also read though, that a person can go through a desensitization regimen and then continue on the carboplatin. It involves getting it very slowly over a 24 hour period in a hospital, and then after that - you're desensitized and can have normal infusions again. I'll be talking to her about that prior to the next chemo. Has anyone else ever had this experience? I don't want to give up on it as it has kept me stable and has been an easy chemo for me thus far - plus, as a triple negative, I don't want to blow through my short list of chemos too quickly!",

Can't say I miss it, but I do feel kind of bad leaving it all to him. We have tons of leaves. We did lower our expectations, and usually don't rake much in the fall anymore. He waits till spring now. Lets them lie all winter and lots of them blow away or break down, and it's a much easier job. As long as he gets them up early in the spring, it doesn't kill the grass. Besides, the oak leaves hang onto the tree long past fall raking season anyway, so doing it in the spring gets these late fallers.",

I also get a very  tight and very painful feeling around my ribs at times, but I'm wondering if mine isn't related to gall stones or gas. I do notice it gets better if I load up on tums or gasx. This is a shot in the dark for you, but I figure you're up for anything that might help at this point. I also find that it helps  to go without a bra when those horrible episodes strike. It likely doesn't explain the shortness of breath, but it might be contributing to the pain around the ribs, as that's where mine is too, as well as the back and shoulders. It doubles me over. Again for me - I don't know if it's a side effect of the gemzar, or if it's a gall bladder attack - brought on by the gemzar. I sure hope you get some answers and some relief! Best wishes.....",

I started out on the Carbo/Gemzar combo 3/13, with a regimen  of 3 weeks on, and one week off. Due to my platelets taking a hit, they backed it off to 2 and 2, then 1 and 2, now I'm at once every 3 weeks. I get a Neupogen shot twice the week prior to chemo to keep my platelets up. And yes - so far so good. It's been a kind chemo for me and I've stayed stable even with backing it off to every 3 weeks. I seemed to have an allergic reaction to it in July during infusion, and so now when i get it every 3 weeks, it's done over about 10 hours - a desensitizing procedure, which is allowing me to stay on it. To me, it's worth it, because it's been my favorite chemo (one of the oncology nurses thinks it's funny that I call it my favorite chemo - apparently, she's not been on the receiving end of the red devil chemo! So my point is.... I hadn't heard that they could back it off to every 4 weeks as your MO did for you - but it's good to hear that it can be done and still keep you stable. You needed that nice little chemo break! You've had a lot on your plate! Hope Mom's adjusting well. It sounds like a stressful but a good trip! Welcome back!",

And it doesn't take a lot of cream - a little blob will do it - right on top of the port, and then cover it w/plastic till they're ready for it. The port is right under the skin, so you can definitely feel it and see it too. It's like a hard round bump right under the skin. My second port is lower on my chest than the first one and it's above the bra cup - nowhere near the strap so that's no issue. Again - so glad to have a port. I couldn't imagine going through all this chemo without it. Best wishes ;-)",

I have a daughter still at home, and a son who just graduated from college this year. A year ago, I didn't think I would even see that. I've had a kind chemo for the past year and (knocking on wood) it has kept me stable. I wouldn't say I feel better physically now then I did a year ago, but I don't feel worse. I've had some complications this year, but not due to the lung mets - problems with heart tachycardia and port infection. I've still been able to work, take vacations, and all the other fun and mundane things that go along with life. I've read on  these boards that some women don't have any complications in their life at all with the lung mets. I do get winded easily, but otherwise, they and the chemo don't slow me down much. It will get easier after some time to deal with the idea of Stage IV. When first diagnosed, my MO told me I would have time to get my affairs in order. I'd say I've beaten that prognosis, as I've had plenty of time, but my trips on De-Nial have kept me from doing as much as I needed to. I don't feel like I need to do it today, either. It sucks that you've got mets. It sucks more that you're young and your daughter is young. I don't have anything to say that will make that all better. It sucks. This board and the lovely lovely women here have been a  huge support and comfort for me. Everyone's journey is different, but there are so many here who are walking similar paths with me and that makes for a much more bearable journey. I come here often. Sometimes I post, but most of the time, I read what others are sharing, and it helps me. You might also speak to your doctor about medication that will help you cope on a day to day basis or on an \"as needed\" basis, because there are sure difficult days. I have medication to take the edge off of some days, but don't use it often. Those days seem to come in spurts for me. I'm so glad I have something to take when I need it. And everything that Michelle said above - I agree 100%. It does get easier after awhile, but the limbo time is wicked. Hang in there. Hugs to you!{{{}}}",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2012 04:08AM - edited Jul 6, 2012 04:11AM by surfdreams I've had two ports. Both times, felt like I'd been punched hard in the chest for a couple of days after they were implanted - nothing that tylenol didn't help with though. First port worked great 100% of the time, but I chose to take it out when my chemo rounds were finished because I thought I was done with cancer. Fooled me. 2nd port doesn't work as well - so far, they can always get the chemo to go in, but can't get blood return to come out - so still often have to get labs via my veins. Still, I'm so thankful to have my port as my veins roll and are difficult to get. I couldn't imagine having to go through all the sticking they would have to do everytime to do chemo (weekly). I didn't like the placement of the first port - it was up by my collar bone and the tubing ran up my neck in my jugular vein. I could feel it in my neck and it was uncomfortable. The 2nd port is put lower on my chest and I like it there much better as it's much more comfortable. Even though it's not good for blood returns, I'm very thankful to have the port for the chemo. I lather it up with prescription Lidocaine cream about an hour prior to chemo. Cover it with a little piece of \"glad press and seal\" plastic wrap and tape the edges to keep it on there till they're ready to access it. I have forgotten to put it on a few times, and it's no big deal to access without numbing. Just feels like anther needle stick. The needle they use looks like it should hurt more than that, but I think that, because the port is so close to the surface of the skin, it doesn't hurt bad at all. Good luck Lynn!",

Mild nose bleeds at times. Neuropathy - though not bad.  After 6 months, my hair started growing back very slowly, but no complaints - it was hair. Sad to be done with Abraxane. It was pretty kind to me all in all.",

I agree with that wholeheartedly. Those statistics online don't take into account the individuals who died of something non-cancer related. And if that's the average, it means that there's lots over that mark as well as under. Also remember that those statistics might be 10 or 20 years old - done prior to all the new medications that have come out since that study began. Lots of variables.",

I have kids at home\".  She then proceeded to tell me that I seem strong, so I'll be OK. I just had to let it go. Hmmmm. I have a kid at home too. Somehow that didn't preclude me from being OK. You would think that in her field and with her family history, she would have more of a clue.....",

I've just finished my 46th hour on the phone with insurance hassles since November. Much of the time it is spent on hold with Blue Cross Blue Shield, but tonight, it was my other favorite - the Federal Marketplace.    2 hours tonight. When I signed up with it in December, it wouldn't allow me to add my daughter, saying she might be eligible for our state's kidcare program. I just received notice 2 weeks ago that we made $1300 too much for her to be eligible, so I decided to add her to my policy via the Martketplace website. Adding my daughter to my policy created a whole new level of GYAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!! It cancelled my old policy and maybe/maybe not started a new policy over from scratch (although I've already met my yearly deductible).  Truth is stranger than fiction. I told the Fed supervisor that I needed to know if I still have insurance, as I have chemo in 12 hours. She said \"what will happen if you don't get chemo in 12 hours?\"  I said \"the cancer will progress\". She said \"would you die in the next 24 to 48 hours if you don't get it?\" I said no. She said \"then it's not considered an emergency.\" I might just die from a stroke from dealing with these &**$%#%$! If you see a huge smoke cloud coming from the midwest - it's not a fire - it's coming from my head!",

In my initial mammogram, even my untrained eye knew there was a problem, as I could see the screen from where I stood at the crusher machine. One breast image looked black - the other breast had a big white spidery blob in it. The tech excused herself for quite awhile before coming back to take more views of the one breast. In my first ct scan to dx the mets last October, the tech was very nice and very chatty. After the scan, she walked out with me and seemed down, and as our ways parted, she said \"You'll be in my thoughts\". Doesn't take a clairvoyant to read either one of those clues though. A friend's husband was recently dx with bladder cancer. He went to the same ct tech prior to being diagnosed. I told her my experience (we jokingly refer to this tech as \"poker face\"). I wished I hadn't told her my experience when he called her after his scan and said that she told him \"I'll be thinking of you\". Sure enough - it was cancer.",

One of the many lessons I've learned since my stage IV dx, is that you have to be proactive in your care. Before being diagnosed, I had enough concerns to address them with my primary care physician, who didn't take my concerns seriously. She wasn't going to order the chest x-ray i requested. I stuck with the request, repeatedly asking , what could it hurt? She eventually caved and ordered it, and guess what? It was lung mets. (the clue factor for me was shoulder pain and horner's syndrome). There have been numerous other times that if I hadn't spoken up, things would have been missed or not done. Don't sit back and wait for a dr. to take you seriously if you have concerns. Stick with it and be the squeaky wheel. I'm not obnoxious, or rude, or disrespectful, but I am persistent. We have to be. They have lots of patients to take care of. Don't allow yourself to be one who falls through the cracks because you don't speak up. Best wishes and keeping my fingers crossed for you.",

By the time I returned, I was too wiped out to do anything but go home and sleep. We had pizza rolls for supper and I made Monkey Bread (one of my DD's favorites) to try to make it up to her.

I went today for just a quick Zometa infusion - takes about 1/2 hour. They directed me to sit in one of the chairs in a certain row.  I had always thought the people sitting in that row were more sickly than the others in the infusion room as it was close to the nurse's desk. But as I walked down the row of chairs, I noticed that everyone in that row had just one or two small IV bags.  I said aloud to the gentleman across from me, \"Oh, this must be where they put the people who won't be here very long\". He started laughing, and I quickly tried to correct myself, and said \"I mean, this must be the area for the short timers\". He started laughing more, and he said \"It's not getting any better\". I agreed with him and told him I just need to shut my mouth. I think only he and one other woman heard me and they were both laughing, so I hope I didn't offend, but to me, it was funny.  Someone posted on the favorite quotes thread one by Jimmy Buffet. I think it was \"if we don't laugh, we'll go crazy\". True that!  And to the previous posters - I'm an Illinois girl too, and yes- the snow and the cold was horrendous. I would love to live somewhere with no snow! On the bright side: it's all melting now!!!",

You're not the same person now that you were then, and yes - I agree completely that you have to put it into context of what you were dealing with at the time. I mean no offense to the very young ladies on the forums, because I can only speak for myself when I say all of my major life decisions were made when I was in my late teens and early twenties, and I was making lousy decisions at that age. I  was fortunate enough  to go to college, though I didn't take it as seriously as I should and I wish I could have a \"do-over\" there. And I chose a very fulfilling path, but one that does not pay well at all. At the time I said that I didn't care if I made money or not - just so I'm happy. I've since decided that I could have also been happy in a career making much more money. My college age son said the same lame statement to me a few years ago and I screamed. He thought that was pretty funny, but he did tweak his expectations a bit and is making OK money doing what makes him happy. In those tender years, I chose my life career path, chose my husband, chose to have children, chose to buy my house, put down roots in a small community,  etc. The years haven't been easy for many reasons, including the fact that I didn't have the experiences of life I have now, but I choose to have no regrets. If I could go back and do things over, who's to say that I would make the best choices even now?",

They might like it better if they weren't required to attend the \"grown up\" church and could instead do the fun things with peers in a different church setting until they're older. By the way - always think of you when having Spam. Loved hearing how well their company treated you.",

Her's thinned but she still had plenty. I wouldn't shave it till I knew for sure how much will be lost. Everyone is different. Mine was all definitely going, so I went ahead and shaved it. Again, your nails may be fine. Mine starting hurting terribly and then starting un-attaching from my fingers from the top down. They've now all (but one) re-attached and look normal again. They were bad for probably 6-8 months, but with nail polish, no one was aware of it unless I told them. ",

I was stage 2 in 2009, but went to stage 4 in 2011. Started Abraxane at that time, and it kept me stable till 2013, when I started the Gemzar/Carbo for bone mets. 2 years later - this year in May, had brain mets which required whole brain radiation and gamma knife. Chemo isn't very effective for brain mets due to the blood brain barrier, so surgery or rads are the options. now that my brain treatment is done, my oncologist would like to err on the side of caution and talk me into restarting the Gemxar/Carbo, but as long as nothing is lighting up on my PET scan, I am ready to let it ride till something lights up again. I feel great (knocking on wood here), and will restart chemo when things start going south again, but so far, I'm enjoying this big chemo holiday. I'm hoping to get at least 2 years out of it! The desensitization protocol involves infusion over a long period of time. My day with that consisted of being the first patient of the day, and the last to leave. I would first get IV steroids and ant-nausea meds and IV benadryl. Then the Gemzar was administered as normal. Then the Carboplatin was started as a very slow drip. Through the course of the day, it would slowly be sped up, but still administered slower than usual. The total day's infusion would take about 9 hours.",

I originally was on one week on and one week off, but also had to back off several times, to my final regimen of once every 3 weeks. This allowed my platelets to recover (with the help of Neupogen shots about 4 days and 1 day prior to each chemo. I had an allergic reaction to Carboplatin after a year - during infusion, but I didn't want to stop the chemo as it had been easy for me to tolerate and we triple negative girls have a limited number of chemos available to us. I googled this problem and saw that other doctors were using a de-sensitizing procedure to be able to continue using Carboplatin after an allergic reaction. I showed the literature to my Oncologist, and she worked with their Pharmacist to come up with a de-sensitization protocol, and I continued on that for another year. My last chemo was in May. Later in May, I had some very concerning symptoms, and MRI revealed mets to the brain. My chemo was stopped at that time to deal with the brain mets. I had Whole Brain Radiation, and then in August, had Gamma Knife performed on the brain mets. About a week after that, I had my first PET Scan. The benefits of a Pet Scan are that any active cancer lights up like a Christmas Tree. My miraculous news is that nothing lit up in my lungs. A couple of bone mets still lit up, so I had radiation on those. I just had another PET scan earlier this week, and no active cancer is lighting in my lungs still, and the mets they radiated in my bones are showing up as scar tissue now. One of the 2 brain mets is completely gone, and the other one is continuing to shrink away. I am feeling very blessed these days. God is good. I think that they have come a long way with cancer medications and that there is hope.",

The other nice side effect of this dosage was that I slept like a log and woke up feeling so rested. I don't think I even rolled over at night. I know of other people that had it prescribed for this as 100 mg. a couple of times throughout the day, so they didn't get that big benefit of sleeping hard at night.

I know February is the shortest month of the year, but it always feels like the longest. I took a girl trip to New Orleans in January to try to get a break from the winter, and it had the polar vortex and freezing rain the whole time we were there. I got a nasty sinus infection while there, so had to excuse myself from some of the evening activities because of the pain. So yes - I agree - it's really been a long hard winter. We're hunkered down for another bad storm today. We're due. We haven't had bad weather for a whole week! But daylight saving time starts next weekend and they're promising 40 degrees in a week. There's that light at the end of the tunnel. A couple of weeks ago, there wasn't a light. Hang in there. Lots of good suggestions on here from lots of ladies. It's motivating me to do something today. Maybe I'll make my daughter her favorite cookies. She really has gotten the short end of the stick. My other kids got a healthy active mom. She's lived for the past 5 years with chemo mom. I like Rosevalley's suggestion re: the light for Seasonal Affective Disorder. I've heard good things about that and can imagine that it would really help.  I love your table and chairs, Divine! So pretty. We need to meet at your house for the potluck or at least tea and dark chocolate! That would sure be a plus to the day! I'll see you all there!

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2014 09:43AM - edited Jan 4, 2014 09:48AM by surfdreams Spirit Blessings - I had a good run with Abraxane for 15 months. If you search these boards for Abraxane, you'll find lots of women who have had good success with this chemo and, although it's not side effect free, it is usually a very do-able chemo. I went 3 weeks on and 1 week off. I lost my hair (but some just get thinning hair so I wouldn't shave it until you see what it will do to you). Another common side effect is nails lifting and turning black - some women have them fall off. My NP suggested that I put vinegar in my dish water to kill fungus that can grow under the lifting nails. They're painful and look gross - the best advice I got from these boards was to keep them polished and cut short so they wouldn't catch on things to pull them back. A good hardening polish seems to save the nails. The other nice part of this is that you don't have to look at them being so icky. I used Sally Hanson Hard as Nails and never lost a nail and they returned to normal over time. Neuropathy is common, but mine isn't debilitating by any means. I had shortness of breath, but I still do, so I'm thinking it's the lung mets causing that. My feet swell with every chemo I have ever had. They would give me an anti-nauseau pre-med with the chemo. I would also take Immodium after chemo as I often had diarea for a few hours afterwards. All of these symptoms improved after the first 6 months. My nails re-attached and hair even started re-growing - though very very slowly! Drink lots and lots of water. Carry eye lubricating drops with you for when eyes get stingy and watery. That's the bad and the ugly of my experience. As for the good - I was able to continue working and living life pretty normally. I never got sick with it. I would get tired. But otherwise, I felt good. I have a chemo that's good to me now too overall, but I miss Abraxane being in my arsenal. It's one I would definitely be fine with doing again! I hope it treats you well.  Mamasboy - have you invited your mother to read and post on this site? We would love to meet her. There are  some sites here that deal with recipes and nutrition that might be very helpful for her as well. And I wouldn't call us brave. We're doing what we have to do, just like most others would do when they find themselves in our shoes. There are lots of chemos out there to try, and I'm hoping her radiation shrinks that tumor down to a size where they can get rid of it. You can always get other opinions as well if you're unsure of her current treatment. Best wishes, and tell her to jump on here as she sounds like a great lady!",

I\"m keeping my fingers crossed that it treats you right.  I've got a date with the couch tonight. I had a bladder biopsy today. My CT scan 2 weeks ago showed my bladder was odd shaped and an area of \"concern\" in my bladder. Followed up quickly with a cystoscope that revealed an area - the likes of which - my Urologist said he didn't know what it was - he had never seen anything like it before. With that crazy bedside manner quote, he sent me on my way with 10 days of penicillin and then back today for the biopsy. My concern was that on the CT scan, it showed the area lighting up in my bladder and including the fat outside the bladder, so I'm thinking a tumor that extended through the bladder which is never good - according to dr. google - often results in losing the bladder. I went into the bladder biopsy with platelets of only 75 (he was hoping for at least 100), but said he would cauterize it good. I'm still here, so obviously, that part went ok. He said the area looked better and smaller than it did when he saw me 10 days ago. So that's a good sign, since tumors don't respond to Penicillin x 10 days. Makes it more likely that it was an irritation from a bad bladder infection. I'm breathing a little sigh of relief to at least have it behind me. I'll breathe a bigger (huge in fact) in 10 days when the biopsy results are back showing that there isn't a new tumor and I can keep my bladder. After all these years, my bladder and I have become pretty attached. Thank goodness for anesthesia and Ativan! I hope everyone's holding their own these days!",

Here's hoping that Abraxane will be your magic bullet!  My gemzar/carboplatin combo may soon be at an end as well. I've been getting these infusions since March 2013 - then suddenly, midstream through my carbo last Friday, I started having an allergic reaction - breathing got very tight. Hands and feet were burning. Face flushed - my BP and Pulse went way up, and oxygen went down to 88. I've seen the nurses in there rush around for a patient before, but this time, it was my turn. They quickly stopped the carbo and started fluids and benadryl. That got it back under control, but apparently, that often happens - suddenly you become allergic to the carboplatin. My onc. is going to try it again in 3 weeks with benadryl as a pre-med, but I'm already very nervous about it repeating. From what I've read on dr. google - once you have that reaction (which can quickly go into anaphylactic shock or respiratory arrest), you'll remain allergic to it. I've also read though,  that a person can go through a desensitization regimen and then continue on the carboplatin. It involves getting it very slowly over a 24 hour period in a hospital, and then after that - you're desensitized and can have normal infusions again. I'll be talking to her about that prior to the next chemo.  Has anyone else ever had this experience? I don't want to give up on it as it has kept me stable and has been an easy chemo for me thus far - plus, I don't want to blow through a short list of chemos too quickly!",

Now, still on Abraxane, they've all re-attached, except for one thumbnail, and no longer hurt. The thumbnail is the last hold out, but even it's getting better and I won't lose it at this point. keep them trimmed super short so they don't catch on anything because, Boy, does THAT hurt when there's so little of them attached anway. Something my MO's nurse practitioner shared with me was also to put vinegar in the water when I was washing dishes as the acid in the vinegar will kill any fungus that might want to grow under the nails when they're loose. Sometimes,  I just soaked my nails in some warm vinegar water while I was watching TV. Something worked. They're doing much better. I also lost my hair on Abraxane, and it has grown back, though still too thin to go topless - and when did it turn gray??? I had the bone pain that I was sure was bone mets, but so far, bone scans ruled that out, and the pain is improved. Abraxane has it's downsides, but it's also sure got it's perks - like keeping the cancer stable so far.....I'll take it. Best of luck with your treatments!",

I was shopping for vaults, based on their height from the floor (so someone could reach it to put flowers once in a while), realized that there is a marble podium in the center of the cross wings, so a memorial service could be held there with a view of the speaker from any wings. Chairs could be set up in those wings (I was imagining where the chairs could go). The acoustics were amazing! No microphone would be needed. A guitar would sound awesome in there.

I just started Gemzar and Carboplastin last month due to rotten progression. I agree with what JillThut said: The first infusion wasn't pretty - 2 days after having it, I thought I had the flu, but since then, it's been OK. And yes - have to keep up on top of the constipation, but don't know which to blame it on - the pre-meds or the chemo. In any case, it is a hard blow, but I'm right with you in hoping that the Gemzar will be your silver bullet and you'll be back to stability by the time your next scans roll around.",

Just recently having problems with the Carbo - but hoping to get past that.  I also had the feet swelling, despite diet changes, elevation,etc. I was a squeaky wheel and my MO put me on Lasix as needed. Well, I need it every day. Great help getting rid of that swelling, and even seems to help me breathe better. So be the squeaky wheel and get something for those feet if the simpler measures don't work. Our reality is that we just have to advocate for ourselves with doctors, and if that means pestering them to get what we need, it does.  Best of luck to  you!",
