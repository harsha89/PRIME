You have every right to get credentials and to explore all the options, including various surgeons and oncologists, available to you. If available to you, you may want to look into going to a breast cancer center. I go to Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, RI. On one floor is the breast health center with surgeons who specialize in breast cancer and basically only do breast cancer and there are oncologists who also specialize in breast cancer. On another floor is the gynecological oncology center, where I received treatment for ovarian cancer. Has anyone spoke to you about talking to a genetic counselor given the family history of cancer and that your mother has ovarian cancer? I would think this would be a good idea.",

It looks like a little hole and it drains.  PS said that it was from stitches that didn't dissolve. He took them out and said to leave it alone, just shower normally and use gauze to protect my clothes. It should heal by itself.  A doctor friend of mine said that this is common.",
