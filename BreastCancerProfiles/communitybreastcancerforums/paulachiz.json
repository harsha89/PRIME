I found a lump in rt breast a few months ago.  I have aleady fought and so far beat the battle with bowel cancer.  I have had surgery, rads, and chemo so when I found this lump i just ignored it.  I have been through so much in the past 6 years i just didn't want to deal with being the sick person again. I finally told my husband and he told me not to fool around and get it checked.  So I did, my dr sent me for a mammo, then the next day called and told me to go back up for an u/s, and another mammo with magnification views. When I went back to him he stated that there are cluster microcalcifications at 10 oclock and others behind my nipple.  10 oclock is also where this lump is.  Sorry this is so long....anyway he stated that the Rad stated is was a Birad 5 and I also noted that the Rad wrote on the reoprt malignant. My confusion is how would the Rad know it is malignant without the path report and have you heard of anyone who has had Birad 5  and turns up being b9.  I have been so stressed over the holidays and today I received a call from the BS that my core biopsy is Jan 14,13. Just scared and confused and wondering if I should perpare for the big C again with myself and family.  I have 2 daughters 22 and 11 and they have been through so much with me....I am praying that I am in the 5%. Hope to hear your feed back as your advice to others have been helpfull. Thanks for listening.
