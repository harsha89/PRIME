On another good note, I had a great weekend with a friend of mine!  We went to bingo Friday night, and I won $500.00!   So, I'd have to say the weekend went well!  I am thankful that we haven't gotten any snow since a couple of weeks ago, but I think the cold is here to stay.

I had my own scare, when I went for my three month follow-up.  I was having pains where I had the mastectomy, so I told my onc about that, when I finally saw him.  He ordered up a ct scan, which I DO NOT like doing, because I'm allergic to the contrast dye, and because I have to pre-medicate the night before, not only with prednisone, but with benedryl...  Anyway, the waiting was the hardest part!  When I went to see Dr. Marino, he said that I'm still cancer free...which was a great, great weight off my shoulders!  At first, he thought I was having pains, from possible radiation scar tissue on my lungs.  After the scan, I was telling him I thought it could be scar tissue issues, which he was also thinking, or he also thinks that it could be residual effects from the shingles I got last summer. So, I'm back in the village, with the oh-so-slowly melting snow!  We still have maybe 7 - 10 feet of snow on the ground?!?  And I'll tell you what, it was sure nice to be in Anchorage, with barely ANY snow on the ground!!!  And, when my mom and I came back, we didn't have to ride on sno-gos!!!    We got to come back to town in a vehicle!   Anywho, my onc also said that I'd be taking Tamoxifen for two years, instead of five...AND I'll be taking Zometa every six months, not every three, like I first stated?  Speaking of Zometa, that first treatment was JUST AWFUL!!!  It almost reminded me of a chemo treatment!  Early the next morning, after the treatment, I woke up in the coldest, cold sweat imaginable!  I got my parka, my roommate was MORE than gracious and gave me her blanket, and I laid that all on top of me!  I almost wanted to go to the ER, but I didn't want to trouble my roommate, as she just had a hysterectomy!  So, I stayed in bed, and thankfully, that cold feeling went away!  When I told my onc about that, he said it's usually the first treatment that's the hardest to take!  Hopefully, it will not be that bad next time! Well, I'm out for now!  I hope all of y'all are doing well! Take care, and y'all are in my prayers!  P. S.  Everybody looks bee-u-ti-ful in their new pics!",

Ace, it's good to know that your onc hasn't seen anyone die from blood clots or got uterine cancer from tamox!  That's a load off my shoulders!  Other than that, I don't think I've really had any serious SEs; except, my hands are a little bit stiff in the morning, when I get up, and I think I had a twinge of depression, when I first started taking it.  What I'm wondering though, if my fingertips are still numb from the taxol... Congrats, princessS! Well, I went to surgery, yesterday, and got my port taken out!  I feel a little bit sore, and my skin's a little itchy, because the doc said not to take the dressing off until tomorrow!  The spots that are getting radiated...THEY ITCH LIKE THE DICKENS!!!  My doc said to take either the pain meds I have, or ibuprofen, since the itching is a pain response???  That, I didn't know.  My armpit started peeling, so now it looks like the color of the preview, submit, cancel buttons to the right. Today, there's going to be a luncheon for us native women, who've had mastectomies, so I'm kinda stoked about that...my chance to take a lil' break from the hospital scene, if only for a minute...Then a friend of mine wants me to go with her to AFN (Alaska Federation of Natives), so we can watch Eskimo dancing; I can't wait to go see them...I only wish I knew how to eskimo dance! Anyway, happy Thursday, y'all!  I only have 8 treatments, including this morning's!",

It's been pretty darn cold out here the last couple of weeks, but it warmed up, ever so slightly, and snowed, last night!   My skin still itches a bit, and it felt like I was getting shingles again, but THANK GOD, it's not shingles!  I've been having a bit of nerve pain too, but other than that, I think I'm doing allright! Our thanksgiving meal was basic, as ever, but it was good!  I think we're all turkeyed out, at least until Christmas! Since I've been back, my other half complained about me getting too much attention, you know, from being diagnosed, so I've been told that men are not TOO terribly vocal about explaining their jealousies???  Does that make sense? I've been kind of complacent about taking the tamoxifen too...I finally called the clinic to get the refill...so I'll be back on...again   I just wonder if I'm going to have to re-adjust, yet again?

By the way, I got another treatment of Zometa, at the end of July, and I didn't have any SEs!  Well, I had a couple of hot flashes, but nothing compared to when I had my first treatment!

Well, the last couple of weeks have been rough for me and my life partner.  His mom passed away, this past Saturday, from renal failure.  Her final wish was to come home and die, instead of moving to Anchorage, for dialysis.  It's been rough for me too, because this brings a lot of pain back, when my adopted mother passed away, and I'm kind of scared, because I certainly don't want to go through the pain of depression AGAIN. There's been a LOT of chaos in Steven's household too, because his older brother is here, not only with his four kids, but Jackson also brought his life partner here.  Compared to how I grew up, these kids don't know or have ANY idea what quiet is?  Hopefully, Jackson will be flying back to his other village, with family in tow, on Saturday?!? Anyway, I hope y'all are doing well! Take care and God Bless y'all! P. S.  I just wanted to update y'all.  Helen's funeral was yesterday, and I have to say, it dang near reminded me of my adopted mom's passing.  When it was the 'in-laws' turn to view Helen, I lost it.  Steve's oldest sister told me to calm down, while Steven was comforting me.  I think I'm doing allright today. I'll write more later!",
