Her Diagnosis: Stage IV,  ILC, bone metastatic, HER 2 neg, Est +, Prog +, growth 2 The doctor is recommending xgeva injection 1x/month.  concerned about the jaw bone and other side effects.  Does anyone have experience with this?  If so, has it been a good choice for you? Also recommended is to be pushed into menopause (28 day process) and take fulvestrant injections.  (the hormone treatments) and also be involved in a trial. Have only had a double mastectomy surgery; has not started treatment yet. Currently no pain, feels good, normal and energetic, but fearful that the treatments will make the situation worse with all the side effects. Any thoughts or experience with these meds and treatments?   If you've had a similar diagnosis, what has been successful for you?  Thank you.   p.s.  I forgot to add that she is not a candidate for chemo. They say her body can't handle it. Dx 9/9/2014, ILC, 5cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 13/22 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
