Both came up normal or saying they didn't see anything, but to come back in 6 months. Went to my breast surgeon who say my right breast actually felt fuller to her. Anyways, just to ease my mind about that dreaded \"hiding cancer\" in dense breast tissue and so I wouldn't have to come back in 6 months, my dr. ordered a MRI. I had it done yesterday. I'm still waiting for the results and hope they come back clear. What I do know is that digital mammograms and ultrasounds do a good job, but MRI can find very small cancers, but they also find things that aren't cancer. Even though I'm anxious waiting for the results, I\"m glad I had it done. Even if they do find something, I'm hoping it will be small and curable.",

Get an MRI...that along with an ultra sound and digital mammogram will keep you from always worrying about the \"what if's\"....BUT do check with your insurance to make sure you are covered for it. They are spendy.",

The place that did the MRI said they would have them to the Dr. within 24 - 48 hours. Would a receptionist lie to me and just tell me they weren't there because the results were bad and the Dr. wasn't there anyways? Why does it seem like everything that has to do with a test ends up having to wait until Monday!!! Log in to post a reply",

Anyways, is it normal for one nipple to be more erect than the other nipple? I think I'm more aware of my breasts since I've been through the mammogram, ultrasound, MRI saga the last month. For some reason I've just noticed that my left nipple is never as erect as my right nipple. Maybe it has always been this way or could this be due to perimenopause? I've looked on line but can't find anything. As I said, this maynot be the place to ask, but I can't seem to find any website site or chat room for women with general breast questions.
