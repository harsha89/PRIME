It also hate how I always think that something they said to me or the way they looked at the screen, means something\u2026. ! Probably it means nothing or something totally different. I try to tell myself: until you heard the bad news, you have not got it yet! Take care, Marietjes",

Finished my radiation by the end of January and since March experience growing tightness of the chest and dry cough - getting worse. Today went to the hospital to have an X-ray. Waiting for the test result, I hope tomorrow morning. Anyone here to help me through the night with a similar experience, turning out to be radiation damage? Like radiation pneumonitis? Would really love to suffer from that! ;) Or just some other supporting words\u2026.. Love & strength to you all Marietje",
