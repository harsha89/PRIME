      "Content": "Apr 14, 2014 06:42AM - edited Apr 14, 2014 06:47AM by QueenOfHope Hiya! I've got a couple spots on my liver in addition to bone mets (mostly spinal).  When my cancer was discovered in Feb. 2010 (I was Stage IV from the get-go), the first thing to happen was a total hip replacement on my right side.  Apparently the mets made my right hip looked like swiss cheese! You wrote:  \"From what I gather, no one goes straight to chemo for small liver mets.... yes/no??\" That was not my experience.  1 month after my hip surgery, I started chemo (Taxol + Avastin).  I was on chemotherapy once-a-week for a year-and-a half.  6 months into my treatment, the CT scans showed 60% shrinkage of the tumors on my liver.  They have not changed since, and my CT scans taken every 6 months since Nov. 2010, show that I've been stable.  The largest of the two is only 9mm, and has stayed that way for 3 1/2 years now. In Nov. 2011, my Onc. thought we probably got all the effectiveness we could out of chemo, and I've been on only Arimidex since then, plus a monthly shot of Xgeva.  (I already had no ovaries, as I had a complete hysterectomy in 2003 to finally put an end to years of horrible endometriosis) I live a mostly normal life -- I work (including a lot of business trips -- in-the-air about every 4 to 6 weeks), take vacations, and continue to plan for the future.  Just this afternoon, my husband and I were talking about what we wanted to do for our 30th wedding anniversary--- and it's a tad over 2 years away! I sincerely hope these comments give you some hope.  My motto for living:  Concentrate and celebrate on what you CAN do-- not on what you cannot do!!",

I did take your advice (and that of a friend who does HR for her company), and I've kept my cancer to myself.  I really appreciate everyone's point-of-view who commented. I guess I was a little naive, despite my 51 years, when I started this thread.  I've never worked for such a big corporation before.  Everywhere I've ever worked prior was with smaller companies, where when the company describes its workers as \"family,\" they mean it.  In fact, when I was diagnosed on Feb. 10, 2010, the first call I had my husband make was to my office to tell them I was going to have surgery on my hip and that I have cancer.  It didn't occur to me to do otherwise. Between my workplace and his, they became a tremendous network of support to us. Anyhoo-- job's going great!  Great place to work.  Enjoying my co-workers very much, and the best part is that I feel my experience is valued.   My manager didn't really blink when I said that I have a standing doctor visit every 4 weeks.  She's really laid-back and so flexible about our work schedules.  It turns out the  cancer center's only a 15-minute drive from the office,  and it wasn't hard at all to make-up the time away.  I just continue to schedule my visits really early so that I'm only about an hour or so late. Sometimes, these days, I just reflect on how odd my life is.  Now that I've passed two years into this journery.....right now, for the most part, I function like a healthly person.  I just look in the mirror and it's hard to believe that I have this \"invader\" living inside me. I guess I'll just enjoy it... go to work.... plan our next vacation... and count my blessings and keep my fingers crossed that I can enjoy this quality of life for several more years.   ",

      "Content": "QueenOfHope wrote: I'd really love your feedback on this topic... After being laid-off (after 12 years with the company!) at the end of October, I've got a new job I'll be starting on Monday.  It's about a 25% raise over what I previously made, and it's in my field so in these tough times I'm so relieved that I can continue to succeed in my line of work.  And, with my cancer being so stable, and I'm feeling very good, I'm so happy that I can continue to work full-time. The only thing that's really weighing on my mind is how to tell my new employer about my cancer.  Knowing that they legally cannot ask me any questions about my health during the interview process, I didn't offer the information.  I made a decision to wait until I was actually offered a job. I have until Monday morning to figure it out.  I just need them to understand that I go to the cancer center once-a-month for Zometa and a visit with my Onc (or her nurse practitioner).  Since we schedule 4 months of appointments way in advance, I can get early appointments and am usually out-of-the-door between 9:30-10AM.  The cancer center is about a 20-minute drive from the office, so I'd probably get to work no later than 10:30AM. My husband says I'm worrying about nothing, and said, \"Everybody has doctor appointments.  I've never heard of a business that wouldn't let you go to the doctor.\"   And he's kind of right, because we're talking about once-a-month, I'll be a couple hours late to work. Has anyone else been in this situation?  How did you handle it?  I'd really appreciate any advice you can give me.    --Shawn-- Despite the bone & liver mets (to say nothing of the hip replacement!), I'm still living a mostly normal life.

My onc told me it was time to re-check to be sure the cancer hadn't mutated. She was actually excited with the results because it hadn't changed-- still ER+/PR+, HER2-. In fact, she describes my BC as \"highly estrogen receptor positive,\" and put me on Fasolodex as a result of the test because Xeloda was too hard on me. My tumor markers dropped 30 points after only being on Fasodex since mid-November, and she's planning new CT scans next month to look for shrinkage. My biopsy was done with a CT for guidance. The doctor took samples from 3 sites and I was on the table for close to an hour. It's a long needle and he did a topical anesthetic first, but I still felt some pressure and a pinch when the needle grabbed the tissue samples. The weirdest thing was he warned me that sometimes people experience pain in the shoulder during the biopsy and that actually happened to me! That was worse than the actual biopsy-- LOL! There was a video screen just to my left, showing a live CT picture of my liver. I actually turned by head and watched the whole procedure on the screen. I was fascinated! I didn't really have any bleeding or bruising afterward-- just a dull ache at the site, like someone had punched me under my right boob! I went right back to work the next day.",
