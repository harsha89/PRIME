On occasion I will also use the 'chuck' (a net like thing full of cushy material) in my bra or under by straps in the back. Definitely helps because I can feel my ribs much easier now! I also have a special bra on order but with the holiday I haven't been able to pick it up. I will update how that goes in the New Year. Happy New Year everyone!",

In February it was better but now it's swelling again. I'm chesty and it hurts to not wear a bra. Are there lymphedema bras out there?",
