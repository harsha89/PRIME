CERTAINLY not but we donot have anything else people who chose alternative therapies are risking everything simply because the information is not there, different people react differently to the same therapies and all cancers are not created equal, there is a huge amout of variation even within the same cancer, breast cancer is no exception. The ideal scenario is to have treatments that can kill only the cancer cells without affecting anything else, and with no side effects but we don't have that and the only way we know how to stop it is through chemo which is a thoughtless monster that just destroys anything in its path, cancer or not.",

Let me qualify what I mean by peach fuzz, it is very very thin hair, I actually did not know hair can be so thin (hardly visible to the naked eye) and it sticks up especially when you put water on it, a real hair is probably 20 times thicker than that kind of hair (peach fuzz), if you refer to Wikipedia you will see a reference to vellus hair, the hair I am referring to is probably the same thickness. I had taxotere as a part of FECx3, Taxoterex3 and I am extremely concerned about the permanent hair loss associated with taxotere and would like to know if what I have covering my head will ever change into REAL HAIR, I did not shave my head but lost it all to the first part of treatment. I am 7 weeks PFC. Thank you for sharing your experience. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair Log in to post a reply",

BC is very tough for everybody but more so for younger couples because of conception issues, find a fertility doc who has worked with cancer patients, I believe this is key to finding a solution that will work for you. Good luck!",

My chemo was during the winter so I wore a fleece cap most of the time at home, I am not going to lie, looking at my reflection in the mirror was very VERY hard but the treatments will come to an end, that's a given, things will start to change slowly thereafter.",

Had my first treatment 3 weeks ago and today was my 2nd cycle. First cycle had blurry vision, breathlessness even climbing 8 steps to my door, getting an ECHO to check on heart before next cycle, had soreness in my hands and feet - my soft tissue got sore and inflamed, had trouble walking for a couple of days. There was no throwing up 1st time around but certainly felt like throwing up pretty much the whole week following the first infusion. I had to be given neupogen shots for 2 days as my neutrophil count was below 500 - it should at least be higher than 1000 - so they had to start minting those WBC early, the bone pain was not fun, not fun at all, according to my MO there is a15% chance that would happen, I like to be special :).

I do not know how they make that decsion (ALND vs RADS ) but for anyone reading this if you do decide to have ALND please check into reverse arm mapping it is meant to decrease your risk of lymph edema.

I read the research about radiation vs ALND and radiation seems to be associated with a lower incidence of lymphedema. My surgeon carried SLN biopsy and ended up dissecting 12 LN at the same time of my MX. I didn't have to go through another procedure because the pathologist was in the OR and she was looking at the LN as they were being dissected - he ended up removing level 1 because 2/3 sentinels were positive. However, my BS also carried out Reverse Arm Mapping, which is a procedure that entails injecting blue dye to see where all the veins that drain the lymph fluid are and to avoid these lymph nodes. I did not want to get radiation because I was going to get chemo anyways so I didn't want to end up doing both - but as it stands now I might have to get radiation (go figure!!). Your BS if trained to do this will avoid any injury to your nerves. However, I have to say that I am still hypersensitive in my top arm and it is still painful under my armpit. It is also still painful to raise my arm and sometimes it is numb. It has improved over the past 2 weeks. Week 2 was the worst for me. I don't know about the side effects of radiation to this area but ALND is not a walk in the park -  it is difficult and you never know what could happen. If you can get radiation and it is as effective, this might entail less pain and suffering.",
