I had the recurrence in February of 2006 and at first I was on Xeloda with some side effects of red blistery feet, maybe slight tingling in the feet but the nodules didn't seem to get any smaller.  The Xeloda probably just stabalized it for a while.  It was after that the doc put me in a clinical trial with the Avastin/Abraxane.  After that I was on Gemzar which I don' think made the neuropathy worse, although on researching it, it said in the trials 64% of the patients developed neuropathy.  After nine treatments of Gemzar, doc wanted to put me on Ixempra but after looking into that I said no way as I read neuropathy was one of the main side effects.  The doc then put me on a 6 month chemo holiday.  I just started a new cycle of CMF which is what I had in 2001 when I was first diagnosed.  I think my feet feel I little worse but it is hard to tell because they are so numb as it is.  After two treatments he did a scan which didn't come out very good, increase in number and size of nodules but doc said hopefully it will improve after the six treatments I am scheduled for.  I don't know what will come after that!  It does get discouraging when all the newer drugs coming out have neuropathy as a side effect.  I joined a Neuropathy Support Group which is not too far from where I live and that has been helpful to a point.  Good luck to you and hope things improve.",
