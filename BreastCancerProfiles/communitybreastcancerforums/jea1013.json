It was wonderful to be done with it in a week, and my doctors are amazed at how well my breast came through it--they all are saying it looks wonderful.  All four of the doctors I talked with felt the results with this would be similar to the mammosite results.  I was too afraid of infection to do the mammosite.  There is one study I found that has five year follow up data on the one week external beam and the statistics are very good--similar to the full breast and the mammosite.   ",

I had someone request the info again so thought I would repost. I found some interesting information on the effectiveness of partial breast radiation: Results \"APBI is a new concept, and there are good 5 - 10 year results available for multicatheter brachytherapy APBI. Not all doctors believe in it. There is a large ongoing multihospital randomized study underway (RTOG 0413) to try to answer the question of whether APBI is an acceptable option to regular whole breast external beam radiation. Certainly, selecting the right women for this treatment and doing a good treatment technique are vital to having good results. For mammosite, a William Beaumont Hosp study showed a 3% rate of cancer recurrence in the breast within the first 3 years. This would be similiar to what is seen after external beam radiation to the whole breast. Cosmetic appearance was good/excellent in 88% at the 3 year mark. A study from Hungary in 2007 randomly compared women to receive either 1)APBI with multicatheter brachytherapy, 2)APBI with electron external beam radiation, or 3)standard whole breast radiation. There was no statistical difference in the 5 year rate of cancer recurrence in the breast, which was 3.4 - 4.7%. The brachytherapy patients had the best cosmetic appearance of the breast afterwards.\" Here is the abstract from the study from Hungary they are referring to: 1: Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Nov 1;69(3):694-702. Epub 2007 May 25. Breast-conserving treatment with partial or whole breast irradiation for low-risk invasive breast carcinoma--5-year results of a randomized trial. Polgár C, Fodor J, Major T, Németh G, Lövey K, Orosz Z, Sulyok Z, Takácsi-Nagy Z, Kásler M. Department of Radiotherapy, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary. polgar@oncol.hu PURPOSE: To report the 5-year results of a randomized study comparing the survival and cosmetic results of breast-conserving treatment with partial breast irradiation (PBI) or conventional whole breast irradiation (WBI). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1998 and 2004, 258 selected patients with T1 N0-1mi, Grade 1-2, nonlobular breast cancer without presence of extensive intraductal component and resected with negative margins were randomized after breast-conserving surgery to receive 50 Gy/25 fractions WBI (n = 130) or PBI (n = 128). The latter consisted of either 7 x 5.2 Gy high-dose-rate (HDR) multicatheter brachytherapy (BT; n = 88) or 50 Gy/25 fractions electron beam (EB) irradiation (n = 40). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 66 months, the 5-year actuarial rate of local recurrence was 4.7% and 3.4% in the PBI and WBI arms, respectively (p = 0.50). There was no significant difference in the 5-year probability of overall survival (94.6% vs. 91.8%), cancer-specific survival (98.3% vs. 96.0%), and disease-free survival (88.3% vs. 90.3%). The rate of excellent to good cosmetic result was 77.6% in the PBI group (81.2% after HDR BT; 70.0% after EB) and 62.9% in the control group (52.2% after telecobalt; 65.6% after 6-9-MV photons; p(WBI/PBI) = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Partial breast irradiation using interstitial HDR implants or EB to deliver radiation to the tumor bed alone for a selected group of early-stage breast cancer patients produces 5-year results similar to those achieved with conventional WBI. Significantly better cosmetic outcome can be achieved with carefully designed HDR multicatheter implants compared with the outcome after WBI.

At the end, her rad onc said he had never seen anyone's skin survive so well.  Has anyone heard of this or tried it?  I'm now finished my week-long, twice-a-day-treatment, with no burning yet, but my rad onc says the burning may happen a week or two down the road.  If so, I may give it a try. (I have some in the wings ready to go if need be, that I got over the Web.) It would be interesting to know what other doctors think of this, if they have even heard of it.  Incidentally, I did try it on a steam burn I got on my arm, and it was very soothing and the redness was gone by the next day.  I wouldn't want to use it on open wounds, but for just redness of the skin I thought it might be a good possibility. Also, of course, you would have to be sure to buy it from a reputable company, given the bad press some Chinese medicines have gotten.  Here's a description of it from the website where I bought some. \"Ching Wan Hung (also written Jing Wan Hong) clears heat, disperses swelling, invigorates blood, relieves pain, generates tissue. Use topically for first, second, and third degree burns with blistering, redness and pain. It has been applied to chemical burns, radiation burns, and sunburns, as well as burns caused by fire, electricity, steam, or direct contact with a hot liquid. It is also utilized to treat hemorrhoids, poison oak, poison ivy, dermatitis, ulcerative rashes, and bedsores. It acts to relieve pain, decrease inflammation and infection, and aid in the regeneration of the damaged tissues. It is fast acting, alleviating burn pain almost immediately after application. It is useful in pediatric eczema.\" Ingredients: Sesame oil, Beeswax, Commiphora myrrha, Angelica poy mopha sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Mastic, Fructus Chaenomeles Spp, and Sanguisorba Officinalis.
