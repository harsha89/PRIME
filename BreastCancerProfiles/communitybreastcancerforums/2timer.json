Some people have low grade small tumors and end up going to stage iv and some have large, agressive tumors with nodes and never deal with BC again after treatment. I'd feel differently if the medical community could pinpoint who the %7 is going to be but they can't. One is either on the right or wrong side of the statistics.",

Yet it couldn't detect an INVASIVE cancer until it was a 3.6 CM MASS??\"  Yep, I got breast cancer again and while I realize that it couldn't have been prevented without a mastectomy years ago (which I would not have had with the tiny early pre cancer that I had), my breast density and the preference for mammography by the medical community prevented my  current cancer from being found much earlier.  I believe it was there all along, hiding.  This is an extremely important issue for women with dense breasts and I found out the hard way that the people who are supposed to be \"following\" you don't always do they are supposed to do.  I felt I was let down.  I was given annual screening mammo's even though I had dense breasts and had several high risk factors.  I cannot stress enough that you MUST TAKE THE LEAD when it comes to seeing that you get the proper scans.  You cannot depend on the medical community;  it's one size fits all with them.  Good luck.",

I don't know what to say to you that could help but I don't want you out there thinking you are alone in how you feel.  It's pretty normal to be scared sh!tless at the idea of any kind of scan.  But scans are a fact of life for a bc patient (at least in the beginning) and they have to be done to ensure proper treatment.  I hope everything turns out okay for you and that you can find some kind of closure and move on.  If you do manage to do that could you post how you did it?  I could use some ideas on that myself. *hugs*",

I was told the exact opposite:  I have  20% chance of recurrence.  But that isn't really telling me anything since either I'll reccur or I won't.  There are women on the mets board who have been around for years with great QOL and there are women who were early stage and ended up dying from the disease.  You just don't know how things will play out.  And you can NOT make yourself sick with worry over something that may not ever happen.  I'm struggling with this myself and I have a very early stage cancer.  No guarantee's at all with BC.",

Two months ago when I had my bmx, they took 6 sentinel nodes from my left breast (where the cancer was) and 3 from right. They all tested negative so no ALD. After the surgery the pathology showed that there was a node inside my breast (I think) that had 2.5 mm of cancer. The BS decided against any further node removal. My question is this: does it make a difference *where* in the nodes the cancer is found? I asked my BS and MO and they didn't indicate it would make a difference, a positive node is a positive node. But it seemed strange that 6 sentinel nodes were clear yet a node in the breast was not. I'm not really too worried about this but I was disappointed to find out that I did indeed have positive node(s) since it would have made me a 1a instead of a 2a but bc is a crapshoot anyway.",

I wish I lived close enought to help.  There has *got* to be some kind of organization that can get you some kind of help -- if only cleaning the house.  I don't know how you can be expected to do things like laundry in your condition.  Maybe you could call the United Way or perhaps there is a social worker at the hospital that might have some ideas.  Hopefully your ex husband can talk to the boys so that they're more helpful (or at least more pleasant -- I have 2 teenagers so I know).  Let us know how the progresso soup worked.",
