These results suggest that women with HER2-negative breast cancer may be spared these drugs, which carry a rare risk of potentially severe side effects including heart damage. I know that oncologists still follow the ACT plan because it is \"the standard of care\". But as a doctoral student, I did my own research when I was diagnosed with 3A ER+/PR-/HER2- breast cancer in 2009 and found this article along with several other studies.  When I questioned the first oncologist I was referred to on the benefits of ACT for me his response was \"it's the standard of care, but you can refuse any of the treatments that you choose\".  Why would I take a drug that can damage my heart when it has no effect on my type of cancer--crazy!! As far as taking the Taxol--it doesn't look to be effective for ER +/HER2 - bc patients http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17928597 CONCLUSIONS: The expression or amplification, or both, of HER2 by a breast cancer is associated with a benefit from the addition of paclitaxel after adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin (<60 mg per square meter) plus cyclophosphamide in node-positive breast cancer, regardless of estrogen-receptor status. Patients with HER2-negative, estrogen-receptor-positive, node-positive breast cancer may gain little benefit from the administration of paclitaxel [Taxol] after adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide. I ended up finding an amazing oncologist who has truly partnered with me through this illness--I bring in my studies and we review them together.  I knew he was the right one for me when he walked in during the first appointment and said, \"Well I know what you don't need-- adriamycin--because you're HER2 negative.\" This of course is not medical advice.  Perhaps you have something different in your diagnosis than those from these studies.  Bottom line is you need to do your own research and print these studies and take them with you to the oncologist.

GO TO YOUR DR. APPTS ARMED WITH INFO--QUESTION EVERYTHING.  I did my own research when I was 1st diagnosed with 3A ER+/PR-/HER2- breast cancer in 2009 and avoided taking a drug that I didn't need that could also have caused heart damage. When I questioned the first oncologist I was referred to on the benefits/risks of this particular drug for me his response was \"it's the standard of care, but you can refuse any of the treatments that you choose\". Why would I take a drug that can damage my heart when it has no effect on my type of cancer--crazy!!

Email me if you would like to read the whole thing (warning--it's long :) Again thank you so much!!     Younger Women with Breast Cancer:  The Impact of Self-Directed Learning on Quality of Life during Chemotherapy   by Christina A. Burke   A dissertation submitted to the faculty of Wilmington University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Business Administration   Abstract   In addition to facing advanced and more aggressive forms of breast cancer than older patients, younger women with breast cancer face a wider range of age-specific challenges, have unique information needs, and often report lower quality of life.  Self-directed learning can be a key component in meeting the informational needs of this population.  The Health Belief Model provided a framework for this research.  Self-directed learning activity levels may help predict health-related action by limiting perceived barriers, providing cues to action, and increasing self-efficacy.  The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine if a significant relationship existed between disease-related, self-directed learning activities and quality of life in younger women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy.  Specifically, this study sought to examine whether a correlation existed between quality of life, as measured by the FACT-B survey instrument, and self-directed learning activities, as measured by the Self-Directed Learning Activities Assessment survey, an instrument developed and piloted by the researcher specifically for this study.  The results of the correlational analysis indicated that no significant relationship existed between quality of life and self-directed learning activities among those surveyed.  The lack of relationship may be due in part to the homogenous nature of the sample.  The study did find, however, that younger women with breast cancer made significant lifestyle or medical treatment decisions based on information obtained from self-directed learning and those participants who engaged in higher levels of self-directed learning took actions that were more significant.  These findings provide support for the Health Belief Model and demonstrate the impact of self-directed learning on health-related action.
