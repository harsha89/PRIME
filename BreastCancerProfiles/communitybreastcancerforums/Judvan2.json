I'm on 60 mg. of prednisone down to 20 in 21 days, crazy. its been three weeks and its still red and hot. They did a punch biopsy and it was negative. My oncologist said she will do mammo, MRI and anothe biopsy if it doesnt clear up. Thank you for all your ideas, I will mention each one. It feels so much better to find someone who has experienced this. Have a great day!!",
