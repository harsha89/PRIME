Even after we knew where it was, none of my doctors, nor myself, could feel it. I have dense breast tissue, so that may have been part of why no one could feel it, plus it depends on it's location within the tissue. Mine was fairly deep. So it's possible to have BC with no palpable lump, though I couldn't tell you what percentage it is.",
