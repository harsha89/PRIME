My chemo ACT will actually begin Friday March 15 since going to get the port in the day before. I am also starting to get super nervous but also glad to have a set plan in place and kind of just want to get started so it can end! I went wig shopping today. Getting my eyebrows microbladed on Friday. Trying to control what I am since the rest feels totally impossible! Hope everyone \u201cenjoys\u201d the few weeks left until this stuff begins, I\u2019m trying to relax, work, go out and do normal stuff!",

Working on my new mantra of one step at a time... which is so not my style. For those looking for ways to prepare, I got my eyebrows microbladed yesterday. It was great, expensive, but I have big dark eyebrows and I think for me worth it if I can have something that looks somewhat normal under there when mine fall out! I have been told you cannot do this once chemo starts because of infections risks, so I won\u2019t be going for the top-up, but I am glad I went",

I cannot believe I need to knock myself back down again so soon for AC round 2 on Friday.... First round I was basically sick and could barely eat for until day 8. A full week and threw up 2 nights I think because of not having eaten enough... this time around I am planning to have some help at home to try to get me to eat and drink and keep my stomach full, and also will be more on top of the nausea meds and stomach meds and the cannabis... hoping for the best. I chopped off my long ponytail yesterday and got a short cut, first time ever... it\u2019s not so bad, figure it won\u2019t last much past round 2 on Friday but will soften the blow. Hope those who are still suffering are coming out of it. Figuring out how to stay fed and hydrated seems to be the key. And time to get it out of system... getting strength from all your updates.

Glad I did it it was cute while it lasted and made me look more forward to that after phase (I have always had it long and just up in ponytails).
