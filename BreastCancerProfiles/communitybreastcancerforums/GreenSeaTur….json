I'm really confident in this breast surgeon- she's got a great reputation and works exclusively with breast cancer and other breast issues. On a side note...being the untrusting soul that I am I called the BS office on Friday to confirm that my appointment was still on and to make sure that all my info had been sent to her office. They had recieved the films but non of reports- not even the pathology. Geez, if I hadn't checked it would have been a waste of time! Goes to show- with anything medical double check! Maybe it's because I am exhausted but when I read that you once asked your doctor if \"probably benign\" meant \"maybe malignant\" and she said no, not really- I actually laughted out loud! Not even a concrete answer to that question either. Sigh indeed! Thank you for the good luck and the hugs. We'll see how tomorrow goes...",

The thing with dense breasts and fibrocystic changes is that it makes it very difficult for mammo's to see everything going on. Ultrasounds are better but MRI's are the best at 'seeing' everything. I would get the diagnostic mammo and an US done. Be sure to explain the new lumps and bumps you are seeing.

Now I would rather go through the biopsies then to not know what is going on with my dense breasts. One of my breasts has lots of fibrocystic stuff going on in it. I've got a fibroadenoma, sclerosing adenosis, cysts and hyperplasia. But only on the one side. It's especially lumpy and bumpy. The imaginis website on my earlier post talks about fibroadenomas. You might need to get a biopsy for peace of mind dependion on how your other tests go, and whether you get a doc you trust or not. Hang on to your balls! You've got to be your own advocate and fight to get the tests you need! Oh, I also had high grade precancerous lesions on my cervix! I had had many surgeries to get rid of it. Eventually, because it just kept coming back, and because I was having some other stuff going on, I had a hysterectomy (but I had them leave my ovaries) I was 24 years old for my first cervical surgery, and 33 when I had the hysto. Managed to have 3 kids during that time :) Take care (again)",

You lay on a table, they swab the nipple, put numbing cream on it and then they gently press on your breast to see what duct the discharge is coming out of. They then insert this little L shaped catheter into the duct(this can take awhile- the ducts are tiny and hard to find). The catheter is attached to a long tube with a syringe of dye on the other end. They will fill the duct up slowly until you feel pain or pressure. Now, for me at this point the doctor taped the tube and syringe to my side and I had to walk over and get a mammogram so they could see the duct. They took several shots at different angles. I had some discomfort, more like a feeling of pressure, in the breast when it was filled with dye. The only problem I had was I fainted while holding my breath during the mammogram and smacked into a wall. I have a heart condition and I guess having the pressure inside my breast and then holding my breath was enough to trigger a vasovagal episode. I have had lots of mammograms without any problems whatsoever. It was kind of embarrassing. Although the nurses laughed because the first thing I asked when I came to was whether the catheter had fallen out since it took so long to get it in (it hadn't, yay). I went on to do the rest of the mammogram.  The only biopsy I've had was a vacuum assisted core needle biopsy which is on a much smaller scale than excisional. They sent me home with a pressure bandage on that I wore for 2 days. I still wore a tight fitting sports bra for weeks after, and I iced it every 20 minutes for 2 days after. I was told no Advil, Motrin, Aleve, etc.; no vitamin e, and no fish oil supplements for one week before the biopsy. Good luck and keep pressure on the breast- you don't want to end up like a lopsided Dolly Parton!",

Secondly, there are many stories on this board alone about women who totally trusted their doctor, didn't get further imaging done, and ended up with later stage cancer than they would have had if they had had a doctor that listened to them and did more tests.

There is nothing to worry about right now. Not maybe, not seems like, but just benign. My nipple has been inverting because of some of the tissue (sclerosing adenosis, microcysts and other fibrocystic stuff) going on behind my nipple. She could pull the nipple out and it would stay out for a little bit before slowly retracting in. She said that is a good sign. If it was pulled deeply into the breast and she couldn't pull it out would be something to worry about. Or if it pulled to the side or started pointing to the ground. She also told me what to watch out for. Re: the discharge- she couldn't get any at the appointment but she said that she worries about discharge that is clear, runny, or bloodtinged, more than the thick white stuff I had. She did a very thorough exam feeling for any lumps. I haven't been that felt up since I was in high school! She took the time to look over my films with me and read over the pathology report to me. She was so comforting and at the same time straight with her information. She does not see the need for any kind of surgery at this time. She does want me to go ahead and have my 6 month MRI, which is actually only 3 months away now. She wants to check the stability of some random clusters that I have and also all the stuff they found around my fibroadenoma, and the fibroadenoma itself. At that point we'll meet again and talk it over. She did say that I have dense breasts and the MRI is the best diagnostic tool to use in my case (she did say that my breast center was very thorough with me since I had mammo's, US, biopsy, ductogram and then MRI). I asked if the dense breast tissue could hide things in an MRI and she said that the MRI that I had, with the injected dye, would catch everything except something really really small and very slow growing.  And with the mammo and US images along with the MRI she could get all the views of everything going on in my breast. The only other thing was she sent me to get my prolactin levels checked to see if that was what was causing the discharge. She told me she didn't think that was it but she wanted to get that test checked off the list. It is not cancer causing the discharge but it could be the stuff going on behind my nipple and my body dealing with it. It was a long appointment with a lot of information and I left there much more at ease. I feel more in control because she gave me so much information about me and my breast specifically. I'm taking some nice deep breaths...",

But my journey started because my nipple starting inverting and I also had thick discharge from it (and my last pregnancy was 6 years ago). The doctors have told me that a nipple that is starting to invert could have many causes, not just cancer. It could be a papilloma, a fibroadenoma (both abnormal growths but not cancer). It could also be that a ligament in the breast has shortened for totally benign reasons. Also, it might be they way your breast is responding to pregnancy. They change a lot with all the hormones running around and getting ready for milk production. I would keep an eye on it but don't worry about it unless you have a secondary symptom come up. They can only do an ultrasound on you right now since you are pregnant. Otherwise they would do a mammogram or MRI. Good luck!",

The nurse says that all those keep the blood from clotting easily. They wanted to do an immediate biopsy but had to delay it since I was taking Aleve, the Vitamin E was in my multi-vitamin and I take extra fish oil supplements. I figure better safe than sorry!",

With all the goes with kids and my business and then these health things I have to really remind myself to find peace and serenity as often as I can.  I really hope they can reach the biopsy site this time. And I hope for B9 results for you! Gottobme-Congrats on the B9! What a relief. I'm sorry you have melanoma. That sucks. Can I ask a couple of questions? Have you had it in multiple sites? Is it typical to have one site and then if you had melanoma removed any recurrence would be adjacent to that site? Regarding diet: I agree that it would be worth mentioning it to your doctor. It would be interesting to see what his take on it is.  Take care ladies :)",

I was told that even if they think it's a fibroadenoma, if it's grown they have to biopsy it to confirm that it is just a fibro and not something else. The only way to truly diagnose what a solid lump is is by biopsying them. If it is a cyst, which they could tell by ultrasound, then they should drain it since it is causing you discomfort. Be sure to tell your doctor why you want a second opinion. He/she should know what a bad doctor he sent you to! You should not have been treated like that. Take care, and stay strong!",
