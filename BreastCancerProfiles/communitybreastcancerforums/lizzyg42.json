    "Content": "lizzyg42 wrote: I recently had a screening mammogram which came back with a concerning spot under the armpit. During the screening mammogram, the tech became confused as to which breast she had started the images on. Does the technician label the breast side as left or right during the mammogram? I mentioned my concern to my doctor and the technician at my follow up visit, but they would only image the side identified on the screening mammogram (which thankfully was normal on the diagnostic mammogram). I'm terrified that the screening tech mislabeled the mammogram and they looked at the wrong breast. Does anyone know if this can happen or if the breast side is labeled by the computer? Thank you!
