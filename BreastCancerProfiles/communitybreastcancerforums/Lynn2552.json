Both breast: 1. Fibroepithelial proliferation, most consistent with fibrodenoma. See comment 2. Fibrocystic changes with mild to moderate intraductal hyperplasia and focal sclerosing adenosis. 3. Significant atypia or malignacy is not identified Surf path comment: Both specimens A and B show fibroepithelial proliferations with histologic features that, in my opinion, appear most consistent with benign fibrodenoma. However, the edges of these proliferation are not particularly well sampled by this biopsy procedure. Therefore, excision of the entire lesion is recommended for full evaluation, and to exclude a low-grade Phyllodes tumor. Microscopic description: A and B. Microscopic sections of specimens show similar histologic features and these are described together. Each specimen consists of needle core biopses of breast tissues. Each of these specimens shows involvement by a fibroepithelial proliferation. Where seen, the edges of this proliferation appear smooth and pushing and lack an infiltrative appearance. However, the edges are not particularly well sampled by the biopsy procedure. Within the limits of these needles core biopsies, no broad, leaf-like, process are present. The epithelial component shows areas of promonient intrductal hyperplasia, although significant epithelial atypia or malignancy is not identified. The surrounding stroma is not particularly hypercelluar, nor is perdiductal condensation seen. Stroma cells lacks significant atypia or increased mitotic activity. Surrounding breast tissues otherwise show fibrosystic changes, with mild to moderate proliferation activity, including mild to moderate intraductal hyperplasia and focal sclerosing adenosis. Significant calcification a are not identifed in either specimen.",

Computer-aided detection was utilized. Additional spot compression views were obtained. Ultrasound of both breasts was performed. Findings: Mammogram: The breast tissue is composed of scattered fibroglandular densities. Focal asymmetry persists in the upper outer left breast. At the site of the palpable marker in the right breast there is no mass, suspicious microcalcifications, or areas of architectural distortion. Ultrasound: Several solid masses are present. In the right breast at 11:00 2 cm from the nipple there is an ovoid circumscribed mass which is wider than tall measuring 1.4 x 0.7 cm. Immediately adjacent there is a smaller solid lesion measuring 0.8 x 0.4 cm. In the left breast, at 2:00 5 cm from the nipple, there is a mass measuring 1.5 x 0.9 cm which is macrolobulated. No additional lesion is seen sonographically. Impression: 3 solid masses seen sonographically. Given the disparate appearance of the 2 larger masses, ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended of the 2 larger masses.

My ultrasound came to find I have two masses in my left and one in my right. The doctor thinks it could be fibroadenoma but is sending my pictures to another doctor to see if they want to wait it out or do a biopsy. Has anyone experinced three masses at one time?
