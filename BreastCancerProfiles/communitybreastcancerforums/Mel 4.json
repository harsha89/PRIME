I had expanders put in at the time of surgery so when I woke up I had a really tight feeling in my chest due to the muscle being pulled.  You will get use to that and each fill up.  When they put the saline in the expanders it doesn't hurt at all.  Then for about two or three day you'll feel the muscles pull and stretch but they should give you pain meds for any discomfort.  Putting the implants in was a breeze.  It feels so much better to wake up with out those expanders. If I can help you in any other way please feel free to ask.  You know I had breast cancer in my left breast but decided to have both taking off because of family history.  I have people ask if I had to do it all over again if I would do it the same and the answer is always yes.  I don't regret doing it the way I did.  I pray everything will go smoothly for you.
