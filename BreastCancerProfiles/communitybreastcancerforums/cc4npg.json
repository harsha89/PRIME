How do we deal?  Well, sometimes we don't do it very well and that's normal.  You do the best you can to get through the rough spots even if you have to take one second at a time.  And then you live your life to the best of your ability as you would have without this knowledge.  Don't let the genetic thing rob you of your life... because it can if we allow it to do so.  I have one daughter, 19, positive and one daughter, 22, negative.  My son is too young for testing.  It isn't easy, that's for sure.",

I do take a lot of supplements to help me fight cancer (those that I've read about), and I exercise more, and try to eat healthier.  But sometimes I wonder if Cancer is similar to other diseases where yes, you can combat them to a degree with how you live, but ultimately you need a cure because it's still a random thing hitting people who seemingly do everything right and still get it.",

Like I said, I use a two step process with Light Mountain Color the Gray products, but the body art quality henna is recommended by most.  Rainbow is supposed to be very good too.  You can probably find Light Mountain at your local health food store (call to see).  If you have a lot of gray, I would suggest a two step process.  The two step process is basically this... the first step contains 100% Henna only, which leaves gray/white hair orange.  Step two contains your indigo or cassia or whatever color you want to tone the red down.  So, if your hair is more than 10% gray, I'd suggest using a step one of pure henna.  Here are some tips:  use ONLY distilled water; do NOT use anything metal unless you want green hair; if using coffee, double the amt of coffee to make it really strong.  You can add just about anything to henna!  But be careful, sometimes less is more.  I only use very strong coffee, and add espresso instant coffee to my second step to achieve my color.  Also, bear in mind you might want to do a spot test to see how long you want to leave the henna on.  Some people leave it on for an hour, some for 6 hours.  Some use heat like a hair dryer to get the color to set quicker, some don't.  Heat can bring out more of a red color.  Use plastic gloves, take off rings.  Have old towels handy.  Get plastic hair caps or plastic wrap.  Prior to using Henna, wash your hair but do NOT use conditioner.  You may use baking soda or a little conditioner after dying to remove all of henna.  Don't rewash your hair though and it's best not to use conditioner.  The color of Henna will change over 72 hours as it oxidizes.  PM me if you have questions.  The link below will take you to a page of real people's pictures and their recipes.

To me, the pros outweigh the cons.  Even with the mess and time, I'd rather put something less harmful on my hair.  And when done correctly, the result is absolutely gorgeous.",

Here are pictures before and after Henna.  I have two albums, one for general hair growth, and one for my first Henna dying after chemo.  I will be posting a couple of additional pictures later today to show exactly how long my hair was prior to this whole ordeal.  It was hard to find one, because I didn't usually have anyone take just a picture of my hair length, so it took some digging!   ",

Here's what I know.  When I wanted to use Henna, I was told to wait at least 6 weeks after my last chemical dye before using it.  I had no problems.  Using it too soon after a chemical treatment (dye, perm) can leave green hair.  The same applies when switching from Henna to chemical dye.  I was told if I ever want to go back to chemical dye (not that I would), I would need to wait about 6 weeks after using Henna in order to use chemical dye.  You can also use Crystal Light Lemonaide in an attempt to get Henna off your hair (I don't know how well that works).  But you shouldn't have to cut your hair in order to use chemical after Henna.",

I didn't feel much like eating after surgery, but I remember being really hungry!  I had the same thing though, I would get full really fast.  Know clue if I've lost weight... I hope not.  I only weighed 102 to begin with! I seem to be continuing to recover very well - 8 days out now.  I was really sore under my armpits this morning, and my sides hurt now from the bruising.  It's strange how at first I didn't feel all the bruises, and now as I start to heal, I'm feeling more.  My right breast has perhaps a little fluid buildup or something and looks larger than the left.  It may be just some puffy swelling.  I hope they both even out and feel they will.  Both nipples look really good... nice color, no blackness at all, and I am pleased to have feeling in the right already.  My incision went beneath the areola and up at a slant toward my armpit.  I have stitches and a long steri strip over top of it.  They'll come out Monday, so I'm going to try to get the tape off Sunday to prevent unnecessary pulling by the doc.  The tight feeling is going away and now only feels like a slightly tight bra.  I actually am already larger than I was prior to surgery toward the top of my breasts.  I never had tissue at the upper parts of my chest and the tissue expander actually fills in the space quite nicely so I really haven't missed the tissue.  I have almost complete range of motion now, but I still move slow.  No pathology back yet, and I'm praying for nothing new and perhaps better news than I've had in the past 60 days.",

      "Content": "Oct 20, 2010 08:16PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:59AM by cc4npg Hi guys!  I'm still doing what I consider to be great on recovery.  I do still have a lot of pressure, discomfort, and under arms is still quite tender, but probably almost 100% range of motion.  I am having a lot of problems with emotions right now.  I was so relieved and happy after surgery, and now I'm dreading my next step... chemo.  I know I'm normal, but it's so hard to control emotions around family, and then I feel guilty about it because I know I'm bringing everyone down!  Then that makes me upset... and it's a vicious circle. I went for my first onc appt today.  My onc is female, and has a little accent but not too bad.  She went over everything I already knew... how BC starts... how DCIS starts... how it becomes invasive, etc.  Apparently I was part of probably a lengthy discussion regarding my case, because she's calling my triple negative an \"incidental finding\".  I didn't have a lump... or pain.. or a mass.. just 4 microcalcifications on mammo.  The biopsy apparently got all the invasive part out (stereotactic).  However, they weren't able to determine the size of it because it was done thru a needle and it was fragmented.  She went on to say it was definitely under 1 cm... well, I should think so if the DCIS was only .9 x .8 cm on final path.  If we knew the cancer was under 5 mm, then chemo wouldn't be recommended, but, being that we don't, she is recommending 4 rounds of Taxotere/Cytoxin.  So on one hand I'm like, cool... no Adriamycin (Red Devil).  But on the other hand, I'm like, ok, so should it be Cytoxin or Carboplatin?  She is ok with either, so now I'm trying to find more info on it.  I asked her about Dose Dense, and about weekly doses.  She feels that's overkill with my cancer being very small, possibly right at the gray area.  The only main reasons she's even suggesting chemo is because of size unknown, and because of my age (43).  She also definitely recommended ooph.  So I need to schedule that probably for December or January.  Assuming I'm feeling up to it.  She said it was not that big a deal really, but I'd still have a 2% chance of cancer there due to no hysterectomy.  Some of you have been thru the ooph... I'm premenopausal... will I be ok? I just feel down this week.  I should be so upbeat having such a good outcome, so I feel badly for feeling down.  Good news is, if I start chemo mid November, I'll be done by around March 1st!  I HATE winter, so if I have to have chemo, this is better for me.  Bad news is... the holidays may not be so great, my birthday is in January too, and oh yeah, I have to get my license renewed so I'll be chemo-girl for 4 years on my license.  I may get it redone after hair comes back.",

So I had a second opinion today.  I asked about the oncotype test, and it isn't recommended for triple negatives and is only used mainly for hormone positive people with early stage to determine if chemo is necessary.  I went to the state university for my opinion, and the onc's there pretty much agree with my first onc... 4 rounds of TC every 3 weeks.  However, my case is of interest to them and they want to test the tissues again to verify I did actually have IDC and not just DCIS.  I can't imagine I had only DCIS... the tissue from biopsy was stained to see that it was invasive... and when I said this to the onc, he said that it was more of how the staining was interpreted, thus the interpretation may have been wrong.  Well, it'd sure be cool not to have to have chemo but I'm not holding my breath.  So I'll know something more on that in a couple of weeks.  I wish I was closer to the university because I really liked them better, but I can't see driving slightly over an hour one way in the winter to have chemo.  He agreed and said the treatment drugs were the same no matter what area of the country you're in.  They were really nice and I'd highly recommend them for a 2nd opinion to anyone.",

I got my second opinion results today.  OSU retested my tissue, and found my IDC at biopsy to be .3 cm (3 mm).  They said there was a super tiny bit of microinvasion seen in the mastectomy.  But even with my IDC being only 3 mm, the onc there says he'd recommend 4 rounds of TC because I'm triple negative and I'm only 43.  The general gray area is for cancers less than .5 cm, often leading to no chemo, so it really looks like I'll do the chemo even with it being tiny.  I don't think I could forgive myself if I didn't do the chemo and a year later found it spreading.  I'm very afraid of the SE's, so I'm a bit down today, but God is in control of it all.  I worry about memory, vision, and SE's that might be long term.  So I'll be reading more about these things now to prepare myself.  Four months from now, I'll be done, so it doesn't seem too bad when I look at it that way.",

Leanna9:  LVI... simply put, from what I've read, this means there is a chance the cancer has spread via the veins, but it doesn't mean it has.  Do a google search.  I will also tell you from what I've read that those who have absent LVI doesn't necessarily mean the cancer has NOT spread.  It's all confusing and pretty much none of us know what these nasty cells are or are not doing because they're sneaky.  I agree... get another opinion and ask questions.",

I guess she got the point I was making.  Seriously, LISTEN to me!  I most often know whereof I speak, and someone has to fall in that small percentage who has one rare side effect, right?  It really angers me that they didn't figure this out themselves... that I had to do it for them.  That is bothersome.  So believe me my next onc appt I'm going to have something printed out from the Neupogen website regarding this side effect and the preventative to it.  As for my pulse right now, it's been hovering in the 90's to 104 so I feel it's coming down.  Otherwise, I feel good.  Oh, and I think I may be getting ready to lose my hair... my head is really sore. Neulasta shouldn't cause me to have tachycardia.  So far I haven't found anything saying it might anyway, but I'm looking again now.",

Sorry to see you here, but I've been lurking on this forum for a while and they're a pretty awsome group!  I'm glad you have Stage 0.  What kind of reconstruction are you having?  I'm getting Tissue Expanders.  My surgery is Thursday, the 7th... obviously nervous but I want this OUT of me!  I did not have a good experience with the biopsy, though I believe I was numb, I felt bunches of bee stings during the procedure.  I'm having the sentinel node injection at 9:30 am, just 30 minutes prior to surgery.  It's just one injection, in the area of the tumor, which thankfully isn't around the nipple.  I'm hopeful I can retain the nipple to the cancer side, since I have IDC.  My BS believes it is far enough away from the nipple and is willing to give me that option.  I may have a one night stay, but honestly they have me scheduled for day surgery and say I still have a chance of coming home that same day!  I don't know too many people that do that, so we'll see.  I will let you know how it went!!",

Abnormal mammo beginning of August, biopsy beginning of September, met with plastic surgeon 9/27, surgery 10/7.  If I were you, I'd call both doc's and ask for a preliminary date asap after talking to the plastic surgeon.  They have to coordinate their schedules, and I was a very squeaky wheel.  What have you been told so far?  When were you diagnosed?  See if you can get your doc's to go with a date the week after you meet with the plastic surgeon.  That's what I did.  The sooner you get it done, the better you will be mentally... trust me on that one.  Keep us posted! So, Vicodin made me a little itchy and they switched me to Darvocet.  Darvocet gave me nausea and a sick headache yesterday.  I finally made myself drink more water to flush it out and took Ibuprofen last night.  I don't feel so sick today at least.  I don't do well on pain meds, and I think it's because I am such a lightweight.  I don't take medicine unless I absolutely have to, so my body is simply not used to all that stuff.  My arms feel stiff.  Breathing is getting slightly better I think.  I tried very gentle stretches today with my arms... nothing major.  Seems like I have better range of motion to the prophylactic side than the cancer side, probably because of node removal?  I'm nervous for my PS appt tomorrow.  I know he'll take the compression bandage off and not sure how that will feel.  I don't like pain.  I may take a Vicodin before the appt just in case.  Janet?  Do you have any suggestions on that?  I took pictures before surgery, and took one of the compression bandage for the picture forum.  I'll take another one tomorrow when he takes off the bandage.  Then I'll have to figure out how to post them.  I get itches under my arms, but when I try to scratch I can't feel anything so I don't know where to scratch!  It's the weirdest feeling ever.  I've had other surgeries so thankfully I know the numbness is because of the nerve damage and a lot of that will eventually come back... probably not all, but a lot.  And I know it can take up to a year to fully recover from a major surgery.  Can I skip the next several months?  I have Chemo still ahead of me, and the ovaries and fallopian tubes to be removed, so yeah... Lord?  It's me again...  Also, I'm noticing it's harder for me to focus on my clock across the room.  I wonder if that's the left over anesthesia or what?  I can see, but I have to really concentrate and focus sometimes.  I keep telling myself I've had major surgery, and so I need to take it easy and not expect as much of myself.  Oh, and I have yet to have a BM since surgery Thursday.  I don't feel stopped up, but I think I may take a stool softener just to be safe.",

I stopped the major pain meds today guys.  They were giving me side effects that were not good.  I will ask for something else tomorrow at my appt with my PS.  I think I'll have to take a Vicodin before going there, just in case.  But yeah, I'm a lightweight.  Ibuprofen (600 mg) has been doing ok for me today.  I'm not pain free, but it's tollerable and my head feels clearer.  Hopefully there will be no pain involved tomorrow.  I wonder how long the numb feeling stays?  I know most wonen get the feeling back to most parts of the breast, maybe not the nipple entirely, but I just wonder.  Today, every once in a while, I feel maybe a little burning sensation.  I think someone said that happens when the nerves start healing.  Ladies going into surgery this week, Ask your doc for something to help calm you prior... like Versed... it worked like a charm for me.",

I have to sit up and magically, that helps.  I haven't decided on implant type yet.  If you're in the US, they don't have the gummies approved yet, but I'm leaning on smooth silicone from what I've read. A word about cold caps.  Go to the actual website and read what you must do for them to work.  You have to start with them on somewhere around 30 minutes prior to chemo.  They have to be changed something like every 20 minutes... and have to remain frozen at the right temp until needed... so you'll need dry ice if your doc won't freeze them for you.  EVERY 20 minutes or so, before, during and 2 hours or so AFTER chemo treatments.  You'll need enough caps to get you through that entire time.  It does add up money wise.  Also, from the website, you'll need one or two people to stay with you during the treatment.  They have to help you put on the cold caps the right way every 20 minutes or so. As to them working, I've heard good things.  Some people still have hair loss.  If you don't get them on right, you'll lose hair in those areas.  The cancer cells being on the scalp is a question... some docs believe it is very unlikely, but no one really knows.  I don't know the percentage of people these actually have worked for, but there are a lot who swear by them. For me, I won't be getting them... per advice from my cancer treatment coordinator.  I'd love to keep my hair, and will pray for it's quick return... maybe I'll have curls!  My hair has always been fairly straight.  It was past my waist prior to dx, but I cut 18\" off before mx and now it's to my shoulder blades!  I will probably get it cut short prior to first treatment, in preparation for losing it.  I've read many journey's here of people who had this same treatment we're having, and so far they've gotten their hair back.  Yes, I know, there are a couple who didn't... I saw them too... very disturbing and frightening especially when we thought everyone would get it back.  We have about a 95% chance of getting it back, so I think that's pretty good.",

This year has been horrible for me.  Every time I go in for something wrong or for some kind of test, I find myself becoming very nervous and anxious.  I know it's normal... I've read hundreds of posts describing the same thing!  I wish cancer didn't leave us fearing things so much.  It's like... I want to be done with the cancer, and have the treatment over with... but then it hits me that no one is ever really sure \"when\" it's over.  It's that darkness that haunts us for many years, if not for the rest of our lives.  I'm really considering, once I'm done with treatment, looking into some type of light hypnosis that would enable me to not worry about it so much.",

I've had some stress recently and is anyone else feeling unable to cope as well as before?  I'm noticing when something happens my heart races and I get really nervous, whereas I didn't used to have that problem as much.  Is that part of what menopause does?  I know I'm in chemical menopause.  I hate the heat associated with the hormones doing whatever they're doing!  Last night I was literally burning up and even tossing off the covers didn't help.  I just layed real still and relaxed until it started easing up, but it isn't comfortable at all.  With the ooph coming up, and instant menopause, I wonder if it'll be about the same or worse?   Weather in Ohio has been gorgeous this week!  Warm... in the 60's!  Got some clean up done from last years plants yesterday... I didn't do anything from September on because of all the mental stress I had from my dx.  My energy level seems pretty much back to before dx.  My fingernails HURT though!  Hoping that goes away.  Can't open soda and other things really hurt.  Also I've noticed a significant decrease in strength to open things, like jars.  All in all though, I think I'm doing well.  Wish these little white hairs on my head would thicken up and darken, but I'm not quite 3 weeks pfc even so I know I'm really expecting a lot at this point and lucky to have little white hairs showing up like I do already!",

The pain was not as bad as I thought it'd be.  It's more a pressure ache, but I have felt some burning pain in a couple of areas which thankfully went away quickly.  I told them no morphine prior to surgery, because my family doesn't handle morphine well.  I was given Zofran for nausea and Vicotin for pain.  The Vicotin makes me itch, so they gave me Benedryl with it.  Going from lying to sitting hurt, especially at first.  First time up to the bathroom was interesting... I was still woozy and weak from anesthesia, but I made it.   They took 3 sentinel nodes, and the preliminary results, which they say are 95% accurate, were NEGATIVE!  I don't have a stage yet.  I'm a bit nervous for final pathology, but I think so far I've been given good news.  My original biopsy showed no vascular/lymphatic invasion, so I'm very hopeful. I notice I can't feel much under my arms... it's weird numb feeling.  My fingers/hands feel a little swollen/stiff.  My shoulder blades are stiff/achy.  I've been doing the breathing thing, and can get up to 2000... I can't remember what this breathing apparatus is called. So anyway, I'm on the other side of it now and feel like a huge weight has been lifted!  I don't think I'll really miss the boobs that tried to kill me.",

      "Content": "Oct 14, 2010 01:59AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 11:56AM by cc4npg Hi guys!  Yesterday was a little rough for me... had some lingering pain and still felt foggy.  I broke down and took a half percocet last night and was able to finally sleep in a real bed!  Today, I feel like I've made a turning point and feel pretty good, although still tired.  I noteced today that my sides, under my arms, look puffy.  I don't feel any jiggling, but it's definitely puffy.  Did anyone else have this happen?  I'm assuming it is probably a little fluid, after all they did take the drains out Monday.  I had only drained 8 ml from each during the prior 24 hours though.  The pressure sensation or rubber band feeling is much less today and I actually sneezed!!  That was a little scary, but it went fine.  Still no final pathology... and I'm nervous only because of all the bad news I've had over the past month and a half.  My doc hasn't told me anything about oncology yet and I assume he's waiting on final path.  I go back to my PS Monday to get stitches removed.  They told me Monday to start stretching, finger walking up walls, etc.  I can raise both arms straight over my head.  Sideways my right is about 95%, my left is probably 90%.  When I clasp my hands behind my head and stretch like a butterfly, that's a little harder... right one better than the left.  I think the range is really good for not even a week out though. HappyGirl45 and faith22:  Sending positive thoughts and hoping you're recovering well!  Let us know how you are when you can! mom38yo:  I had NS bmx Oct 7th... cancer on the left, prophy right, triple negative, grade 2, no stage yet, BRCA2 positive.  They took 3 nodes and say preliminary results at time of surgery looked negative for cancer and believe that will stay true for final path.  They took a core biopsy at time of surgery under my left nipple too, and it also came back negative during surgery.  I had immediate reconstruction but they only put 25 ml in at the time.  I was a small A cup and honestly I look almost the same size as before surgery.  I didn't have valium the night before, but asked for Versed as soon as possible that morning and remember nothing except talking to the BS prior to surgery... then I was being wheeled back into my room and it was over.  I was a wreck prior to surgery.  Today marks my 6th day out, and I took Extra Strength Tylenol yesterday, 1/2 Percocet last night, and only had 2 Tylenol this morning.  I plan on taking at least a 1/2 Percocet again tonight to help me rest.  The TE's feel like rocks to me.  I'm mostly numb from the nipple up to my collar bone and have feeling from the nipple down.  Armpits have feeling now.  And thank God, I have what appears to be complete feeling in my right nipple!   Janet: I haven't had anything like that.  The weird thing I noticed was with my vision, which seems to be clearing up.  My left eye has always been better and clearer, but my right seems to be now.  It may straighten out.  The tight rubber band feeling is way less, and now the feeling I have is similar to when I was breastfeeding and was full... very strange but I'll take that over pain!",

I have had some emotional moments recently.  I still contribute it to all the trauma and meds.  My mind drifts into areas that I shouldn't even be thinking about.  I've got 3 kids, breastfed each one, my baby will be 3 next week (maybe that's triggering some of it).  I absolutely loved nursing my baby and at 43 I probably wouldn't have had more children, although right before diagnosis, believe it or not, we toyed with the idea.  And it got to me today... I'm officially done with those years... childbearing or otherwise.  I completely forgot about the fact I'm BRCA2+ as I was remembering past pregnancy and nursing.  I know I wouldn't bring another child into the world knowing I could pass that to them.  I have 3 kids... and I am blessed to have had children because many who have the BRCA haven't.  I think it's just everything hitting at once.  Like I said in another post, we go thru this on adreneline and then it starts sinking in.   I still continue healing well.  I've not had a nap during the day since I came home from the hospital. Having an almost 3 yr old and not a lot of help, I didn't have a choice.  I've been driving since  Oct 17th... took myself to church because no one was available and I was determined to get there.  I have a bit of seroma on my non cancer side but it's not really painful.  My TE's were only filled 25 ml during surgery, so that probably has an effect on recovery.  First fill is next Monday, the 1st.  I'm nervous for it only because I don't know what to expect, but after going thru what I've been thru, I figure it'll be a piece of cake.  My incisions look wonderful... steri strips off today and gonna take pictures for the picture forum in a while.  I think they'll be almost invisible once done.  I guess today is just a down day... plus it's cloudy and I dislike winter greatly (always gotten depressed during the winter)... AND I'm in Ohio so today we had all these major storms come thru with tornado warnings left and right!  But mainly I got myself down by reminiscing, which has wonderful memories.  Wish I could go back and relive them, but I think I'm going to get off the computer and go play with my little boy... and make NEW ones instead! ",

The burning sensation is definitely normal and I've heard it related to both nerves regrowing and a \"phantom\" feeling after a breast is removed.  I've read that this phantom feeling occurs in people who have had a limb removed too.  Whatever the case, and I lean more toward nerve growth, it usually dissipates over time.  I had a slight burning, more like medium discomfort, going from sitting to laying and vice versa.  I had nipple sparing bmx 10/7, and actually last night I had quite an uncomfortable night of sleeping.  Mine, I believe, was due to a seroma that has been reabsorbed so my right side is now feeling some discomfort from the expander or whatever.  I feel actually wonderful this morning, so maybe that part is over.  But that just gives you an idea that you'll have good and bad days, but will notice an increase overall with good.  Yes, use alcohol pads for the drains.  I actually used gloves too, so that I'd keep everything sterile.  I agree with Janet, you'll feel all kinds of strange things... zaps, stings, itching, burning, twinges of pain if you move a certain way.  The things to keep an eye on are increased swelling, redness, feverish skin, fever, and any drainage that resembles infection.  If in doubt, call your doctor. Sleeping... I think we all just kind of did our best the first few days.  Recliners are your friend.  Pillows under the arms help.  After drains come out, you may be able to very carefully figure out how to lay on your side.  Keep the pain meds coming.",

A word of caution on massaging with lotion.  Make sure your incisions appear to be healed with no raw areas.  I wouldn't have started if I'd still had some raw places, because of the fear of infection.  I was very careful and cautious the first time since I have no feeling in some areas and didn't know how hard I could push.  Over time, you'll get used to how everything feels inside and out.  But yeah, it was pretty creepy feeling the TE edges when I started... that and the lack of sensation was just weird. Also, if you still have drains, be really careful not to get anything around the tubing that goes inside.  I didn't massage while I had drains and hopefully you'll get them out really soon!  Just hang in there for now... things will get better tremendously after those come out!",

I don't know if you'll have another drain when the TE is placed, but it's something to ask the PS.  Ask him about pain/discomfort, as well as when you can shower/excersize.  You'll want to keep out your button up tops.  I only wore them for 4 days, but my drains came out really soon (at 4 days out).  Also ask the PS how much he will fill at time of surgery, which varies according to how tight the TE is under the muscle.  Trust me, you don't want him to fill it more than he suggests.  The discomfort comes (from my understanding) from filling too much too quick.  Many women have the other side augmented, so ask the PS opinion on that.  Finally, there is a picture forum here that will show you results from other people who have gone thru this.  I very highly suggest looking into being approved to see this forum.  Timtam is the one who gives the permission and password, but there are a few other women on the board here who can help you.  If you have difficulty finding Timtam's profile to send a pm, let me know. Well guys, I was busy today!  I saw the BS, PS, and went to the Look Good, Feel Better Class!!  BS is THRILLED with my results thus far, and requested pictures so he can use them for other patients/presentations he does for nipple sparing mx.  The PS was also quite pleased with results thus far, and feel my final result will be great.  The Look Good, Feel Better class was awesome.  I got some make up (part of which I may not use), some scarves/hats, and a wig!  My insurance won't cover a wig, so that was a plus.  It's not exactly like my hair now, but better than nothing!  I'm also going to call Locks of Love and see if they have any kind of wigs.  There were only two of us in the class today, and the other lady was taking 6 rounds of TC and was half way done.  She really hadn't suffered any great side effects, so that was really good to hear/see.  My whole week is busy.  I have at least two more dr visits this week, one being my onc on Thursday.  And maybe my ears heard wrong, but I thought I heard something about possible SNOW (that four letter word) on Thursday!  Yuk... give me the 90's I just left in Cali!  Hope you all are having a fabulous week!!  If it's warm where you are, go out and enjoy it for me!",

My son got a full bucket of candy last night!  He's been munching on it unfortunately, but we usually don't give him candy.  So many cute kids out last night!  One of the houses in the area we go always has cider and donuts... GOOD donuts... and different varieties.  So we got a treat too!  Some of the homes give full size candy bars, and the church always has hot dogs, hot cocoa, and coffee.   Excited for tomorrow... first fill!  I have a couple larger bras because I'm not sure what size I'll get.  It doesn't feel as weird now when my son is sitting on my lap.  It's still numb, but since most of the pain is gone, I think either I'm getting used to it or it's actually feeling not as \"alien\".  I still believe a good deal of the feeling will come back to the upper breast, but it'll take time and I may not even realize it's happening.  Just glad both nipples look wonderful, and to have feeling in the right one.  The scars are healing nicely.  I started using a special lotion and massaging them just a little to help with blood flow and scar tissue break up. I believe I may watch a scary movie in a bit.  But first I'm going to Henna my hair (or my significant other is).  It may be my last time doing it if I have chemo.  Very frightened of side effects now... afraid of memory problems, vision changes, neuropathy, and long term possible effects.  The oncologist said something can happen to the bone marrow later down the line.. doesn't happen with everyone but to some.  Still praying the university determines only DCIS, but then I'll most definitely need to have a 3rd opinion.  I'll happily get it if there's a chance of only DCIS but not getting hopes up too much.",

While there, standard procedure I guess is to place a heart monitor on.  Never had one and my heart tends to beat a bit faster, sometimes in the upper 90's, occassionally in the 120's, and if I'm highly aggitated or a major issue has just happened, it can go to 140.  So I had one, and heart was racing.  While laying in bed, it was around 120's.  I had test after test for the white count... chest x ray, blood cultures, urine cultures.  It slowly rose from .8 to 1.3 in 24 hours, then to 2.2 by 48 hours.  The onc was going to release me, but the heart was still of concern.  After walking in the hall, it went to 157, so a cardiologist was called in.  I then underwent an EKG, CT with contrast, and Echocardiogram, as well as thyroid blood check.  In the meantime, I was extremely frustrated and irritated with the whole thing!  My heart is normally high, not quite like this, so what changed?  It was high on arrival they said, so what happened?  Neupogen happened.  I came here and searched for neupogen and found it has done this to others... tachycardia.  It's rare, but it's even on their website as a side effect.  None of the docs had heard of this, and I don't think they still believe the chemo or neupogen has something to do with it.  But I've read it here too.  Anyway, long story short, I came home. Now I have three specialists to follow up with:  Oncologist (for BC), Pulmonologist (for lung nodules believed to be histoplasmosis), Cardiologist (for poss tachycardia) OMG... 2010 cannot end soon enough!  This is seriously nuts!  I'm really thankful I've had so many people praying and thinking of me, but being on that oncology unit in the hospital was like being on death row.  One person even died while I was there right who was right in my same area!",

I got another expansion today and I had 3 people in the room (nurse and two people finishing their clinicals).  My audience really liked how the girls are looking!  One young surgeon said I could just keep the expanders!  I'll agree, they are awesome.  I have cleavage that I've never had before.. not sure what to do with that!  lol  And I'm anxious to wear some tops I've never felt comfortable considering to wear, or trying on bathing suits to see how they look.  I'm definitely a C cup now.  My B cup is not fitting so well.  I never knew boobs could be so cool!",

The main reason we get cancer, undoubtably, has to do with all of the bad things we eat, drink, inhale, and probably the unseen air waves being sent hither and yon from cell phones, satellites, televisions, microwaves, and computers.  But I also believe, and some of it has been proven, that these things cause other health problems such as vision and hearing.  It is the era in which we live.",

HappyGirl45:  Sounds to me like a little seroma.  I've read the body will reabsorb the fluid, but sometimes they need to drain it off.  Are you stripping the drain?  The only other thing I could imagine is maybe there's a little clot in the drain, so I'd try stripping it if you haven't.  My TE was only filled with 25 ml at surgery, so I'm sure I wouldn't hear any sloshing from that.  My understanding is that the TE's are completely deflated with no air in them, so they probably don't slosh.",

I went to the PS yesterday.  Stitches out, steri strips on!  Arrgg.  Incisions look good, range of motion is great, no pain meds during the day.  Don't get me wrong, I still have discomfort and sometimes when I move the wrong way I hurt, but I'm trying to stay off as much med as possible.  I think my digestive system is getting back to normal.  I was somewhat constipated like many others.  I regulated this with cutting back pain meds, drinking water, and eating prunes/apples and anything that would help.  I will have my first fill Nov 1, PS wants to go slow.  I do have some fluid buildup and I think he wants some of that to dissipate.  I don't think it's a whole lot, but it's probably contributing to the soreness I feel under my arms.  My first onc appt is tomorrow... not looking forward to that... but I know I have to hear what he suggests and it will probably be chemo.  I hadn't questioned chemo until my final pathology report, always assumed I'd have it.  Now I still think they will recommend it, but I have a small question because they never said how much \"invasive component\" there was, only that it was present at biopsy and fragmented.  I know there are a small number of people whose triple negative is caught extremely early and I feel I am one of those, and sometimes they don't recommend chemo for people with less than 5 mm IDC.  So it should be interesting to hear his suggestion, and of course if he suggests no chemo, I will get two more opinions. Hope everyone who had surgery this week is healing well!  Looking for more posts with good final path results!!!!",

My daughters had genetic testing today.  I'm very concerned about their results and don't want either to have this.  I know it doesn't mean they'll \"get\" BC, but still, I worry.  My half sister is also being tested.  My half sister and I are the only ones with BC.  The only family history unknown is from my father's father.  Dad died at 36 (suicide), and his dad died at 36 (cirrosis of liver, not alcohol result).  I don't know anything about that side and wish I'd done more geneology.  If my mother were alive, she would tell me if genetic testing was done on all of us, they'd find something weird somewhere in all of us. So I try not to let my mind wander too far. As for prophylactic mx... I completely am in favor of someone doing this prior to a cancer dx.  The results you want for final path on that would be negative, so eileen, you definitely did what I would have done.",

TE's... yes they're a pain.  Each morning I wake up and moving hurts, but once I'm up it's ok.  I look forward to having them removed.  \"Iron bra\"... definitely.  There are few descriptive words for them until you actually have them.",

Now, as for your PBM... in my opinion... YOU DID THE R-I-G-H-T THING.  I had a bilat mx too, and the only thing they found left was tiny DCIS.  I know you're stressing wondering if you should have kept them, but you'd already had cancer and your decision was based on your personal experience with your breast problems, and the knowledge that you had the option to have them removed, thereby almost eliminating that risk for future problems.  Do we know that they would have become cancerous again? NO.  But we all know that if there is a recurrence, it could be much worse in terms of prognosis.  That's a chance, personally, I wasn't willing to take.  We can live without our boobs... but not without our life.  I haven't been stressing over the loss of my boobs, but I can tell you my emotions have been off the wall since surgery.  I had a similar thing happen after my last C section.  Keep in mind, especially if you're still taking meds, that sometimes medication can have an affect on you that will make you think and feel things that you otherwise wouldn't.  My family has a history of this very thing with certain meds, and especially morphine. Feel free to vent all you want here... get it all out.. say what's on your mind.  I'd bet money (if I was a betting person) that there are a lot of other women who have felt exactly the same way as you are now.  Focus on one day at a time... take deep breaths... remember the feelings prior to surgery... tell yourself over and over why you decided to have this done... and then tell yourself you did the best you could to save your life... and I believe that should enable you to continue healing.",

Everyone seems to be coming along well here.  We haven't heard from our latest surgery people yet and I'm hoping they're healing well and resting.  If any of you have kids or grandkids, would love to hear what they're going to do for Halloween.  I personally wasn't allowed to trick-or-treat when I was growing up.  We went to lots of Harvest Parties.  But I enjoy taking my son out, seeing all the kids dressed up so cute, and talking with people in neighborhoods (since my neighbors are further away, there's not much talking.. lol).  Plus this year, he's actually old enough to know what's going on!  Too cool!!",

I start chemo next week.  Just heard from onc today.  Ironically, my half sister started chemo the Monday after Thanksgiving when she was diagnosed 6 years ago.  Really weird.  I'm waiting on test results from a pulmonologist.  Earlier this year, in March, I had a really bad illness.  Started with feeling like the flu... achey, extremely tired, chills, and a cyclic fever that would come in the afternoon and break in the middle of the night with tremendous sweating (woke from that a few times).  Went on from March to late May... kinda on and off.  I developed a cough in late April which became worse and worse... very productive.  I finally went to the dr after I spit up some blood.  A round of antibiotics, two chest x rays, and a ct scan with contrast later... they determined I must have had a fungal infection called histoplasmosis.  I haven't had any cough since, so I figure I had a whopper of an infection.  Well, I wanted to see a pulmonologist back then, but they were booked up.  So last week I finally got in to see them and had an x ray and regular ct (no contrast).  He wasn't real concerned at the appointment... ran a breathing test while I was there... guessing I passed, nothing mentioned.  X ray had really nothing spectacular on it... maybe the hint of a nodule (but I had 3 nodules in June that didn't enhance, thus the probable infection).  So I called them today right before they closed, and the nurse said they couldn't give the results over the phone because the doctor hadn't been in this week and hadn't reviewed the results.  I figure if anything weird had come back, they would have called me, but I won't lie... it's stressful.  It's been a bad year for me, but then, I've had a rough time since 2006 honestly.   My energy is pretty much back to normal.  I had a fill on Monday, and have noticed it's harder to get comfortable at night.  The TE's seem to be squished together more now since they're filling out.  I'm a side sleeper.  I feel really good physically.  I'm not looking forward to chemo, but I'll gladly do it because I am much more afraid not to.  I realized today that I would be petrified any time I had a strange symptom if I didn't have chemo.  With chemo, I really feel I'll be more calm with aches or pains.   Have a good holiday guys!",
