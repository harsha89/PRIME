The one thing that radiation does prevent is ever radiating that same breast again.    Just like you can find women with metastatic cancer, you probably don't know all the women around you who are 5 - 10 - 20 year survivors of BC who are living normal lives.  Just my two cents.   Debbie ",

Layne, I guess it isn't enough to contend with work, radiation, and life in general but then you have to throw a cold in there.  I'm glad you at least opted to work from home and still enjoyed your walk. Helen,  20 tx down and you're doing okay?  That's inspiring.  I hope everyone is getting on well with their treatments.   Debbie ",

FerretMom, be sure to drink lots of fluid.  Depending on your body's caloric needs, be sure some of those fluids have calories, at least that's how my med. onc. put it.  Drink gatorade, V-8 juice, whatever your pleasure along with water.  Goes a long way to manage the dizziness. I'm done with 15/33 treatments.  So far, so good with me.  Using the Jean's Cream, mostly.  My skin is a bit pink but otherwise fine. I'm doing T-day.  This time will be different than most.  I'll finish my rads on Wednesday.  Then we'll get into a hopefully already packed car to drive 6 hours to my dad's north of Syracuse in NY.  I'm bringing the entire T-day dinner makings including the pots, pans, ingredients for dinner.  He's 79 and looking forward to it.  I'll then prepare T-day dinner on Thursday while my dad stands over my shoulder to make sure I'm doing it right.  I'm only 52 so I'm still learning.  :-) Layne, I hope the cortaid is working.   Debbie ",

Lymphedema is swelling, usually in the arms or legs, that occurs as a result of  an impaired lymphatic system.  For those of us with BC it is from the removal of lymph nodes with the sentinel node biopsy but more so with the axillary node dissection.  If the lymphatic system has been impaired, the lymph fluid can back up and swelling occurs.  It is an accumulation of tissue proteins, edema and chronic inflammation within an extremity. I was doing okay until the last month of chemo.  I think the edema from the taxotere that the steroids were to help abate may have contributed.  Radiation can also contribute to it. Some folks get truncal swelling as well as in the hands and arms.   The Lymphedema board here on bc.org has been a real help. Let me know if you want more information. Debbie ",

I also had a bit of a scare that was resolved on Friday.  I have a sore rib that isn't in the radiation field but on that side of my body.  I tried to connect with the onc. on Thursday afternoon but he was doing the breast clinic.  My regular rad appt is 4 PM.  I made plans to go in for my treatment a bit early on Friday to meet with the onc.  He sent me up for x-rays immediately. By the time I got back downstairs to radiation and changed, the onc was reviewing the x-rays on his computer.  He called me in to tell me he could see nothing to indicate mets.  Looks like I have an inflamed interstitial muscle.  Needless to say, I was greatly relieved.  Like he said, he didn't want me to worry about it the entire weekend.   Hope you all had a great weekend.

You'll miss your walk but it'll be great to get some time back.  Although I finished with the rads, I am now doing the daily lymphedema treatments.  The good news is they are 7 AM appointments.  I finished listening to the book Middlesex.  In the end I liked it.  Loved the narrator.  Now I'm listening to Mayflower.  The drive to these treatments is serving a purpose.

They seem to provide just enough compression for me. Just one more thing to consider in our growing bag of tricks. Debbie ",

Going back to the previous thread again, I like your suggestion of bouncing on the balls of your feet in a rhythmic fashion to simulate the rebounder when one isn't available.  I am new to the LE scene and love expanding my bag of tricks with this kind of information.  I do have the luxury to work at home.  I was just listening in on one of those quarterly rallying concalls (on mute with speakerphone on) scantily clad doing my MLD.  :-)  Next call I'll be bouncing on the balls of my feet.  Thanks!
