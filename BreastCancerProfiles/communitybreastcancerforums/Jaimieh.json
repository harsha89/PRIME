Realize there is nothing beside exercising and eating right after your treatment is over. I spent so much time looking at stats and numbers after round 1 that I regret that time. I wasted it. I don't regret my time at BC.org just that I wouldn't look up stats. I am one of the unlucky who after 5 years my stage 1 came back in a piece of leftover breast tissue after a double. The odds of that happening are SOOOO LOW. So I often tell people do the treatment know that you did the best that you could and once you are done go live life :).

Not amazing but enough that I was able to workout, 3 loads of laundry, and work on some of my work (I am a photographer). I hit the wall about 5 pm and I am now just chilling until bed time.  My hopes are just to stay the same or start to feel better until round 2 of AC.   I do have some bone pain from he neulasta but all in all I am feeling okay. Hoping and praying that the Emmend continues to work because I really don't do well once I get nausea. My last time in chemo I lost 30lbs while taking TCH.   My hats are on their way along with my new hair piece now I just have to make piece with cutting/losing my long hair. :(. ",

At the hospital that I go to the ACS employees do the class so there is no pressure from a salon or anything. I signed up but I can't remember when.

I think the mind games are almost worse than just making you feel bad.  As for me I woke up last Thursday with This knot I have had forever on my neck being a little larger. I guess when I go for my I between oncologist appt tomorrow I will ask about it. Along with my back has what looks like an infected area grrrrr.  Not happy about it at all.  So I overdid it this weekend. :(. I woke up Friday feeling great and did a ton of running around trying to get things done. Saturday I woke up early 6:50 and decided that my front garden needed to be cleaned out and mulched. After that we went to my daughters lacrosse game out to eat and then we went to go shopping but I had to go home because I was exhausted and not feeling well :(. Yesterday was three kids games supervising my company while we shot a sports league and just more over doing it. Grrrrr.  I hate not being able to do everything that I normally can.  Round one side effect for me with AC; Dry mouth. Immediately. As soon as the drug is started to be pushed in.  Dizziness. For three days.  The worst was Thursday after treatment I felt like crap emotionally and physically. My bones hurt but I need to take Claritin for longer.  I gained about 4lbs with infusion which I slowly lost plus a couple other pounds. I am done about 2lbs so far and not from trying. ",

I forgot how cold being this close to bald is.  So my neulasta never made it here and I am pissed. I needed this shot here today to make sure I stay on track and some how someone screwed it up.

SO finally tomorrow is treatment #3 it's also our wedding anniversary which what a way to spend the day. The crazy part is that I will have treatment #4 13 days later.  So tomorrow I will be trying not to throw up as they push AC. I get a weird feeling in my port and the taste in my mouth makes me want to throw up. Uggghh.  Does anyone else that is going thru AC still have some hair ??  It's not consistent but I still have hair on my head and body hair still. I am a little shocked because the first round with TCH by the third treatment I was bald. I am hoping that this means I will have some hair growth during taxol. ",

I am not sure what to expect but I am happy that AC doesn't require decadron (aka dread a dron). It is going to seem odd sitting back in the chair after 5 years. :(. Not something I want to do but I am going to count my current blessings and get it done. I mapped out my infusions as long as I stay on the plan I will be finished chemo mid September.   I just dread the looks of pity. :(.  So tomorrow I will order the hats and hair piece that I need and just keep powering thru things. Day 1 of 126 is tomorrow. I remember what my pops used to say the hardest part with some things is just getting there. ",

A little T25 is better than no T25. I am supposed to abs today as I am following my own calendar because of the rads x-rays. I need to space out Total Body circuit so it's not before x-ray day.  My arms and shoulders hurt after TBC. :).  So 5 rads down 28 more to go. That seems like forever. ",

If you try it yourself just make sure you have a hairdresser back up plan.  Speaking of hair FINALLY I started to grow mine back. It's coming in like crazy including all of the places that I really don't want hair back. I will take it though because I was tired of being bald. So my hair is dark at the bottom and white on the tips which is odd looking. It's only about 1/4 of an inch but is filling in pretty good. I love listening to my kids about it.  I am now just hoping by the time we go on our cruise in Jan that I have some coverage. At least I know it will only take me a couple minutes to do my hair. :).  I also finally finish rads this week. :). Now I just pray it doesn't ruin my flap from 5 years ago. ",
