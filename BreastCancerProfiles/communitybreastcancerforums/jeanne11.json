I had a three week break before starting the 3 weeks on/ 1 week off schedule and the neuropathy improved quite a bit by the third week.  I also have gotten some peach fuzz on my head and hope  it continues to grow.  Time will tell. I found when I was on A/C chemo, I was able to predict when I would be feeling bad and when I when I would start to feel better.  I also found the first 6 or 7 weeks of Taxol to be fairly predictable in how my body would respond.  It seems harder for me to predict how I will be feeling now.  There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to the days the neuropathy or fatigue feels worse. The streroids given prior to treatment do give me a burst of energy the day after treatment.  They also cause insomnia the night of treatment.  I have a prescription for Ambien and will often take one the night of treatment.  It also pays to keep some apples and prunes handy as constipation can be a problem. Best of luck.  I hope you find Taxol to be an easy chemo.",

I have had some really wonderful physicians along the way and some that I have wondered how they ever got through med school.  When I was first diagnosed, I didn't know a whole lot about the disease. At the time, I had one friend that had been diagnosed with it and she was (and still is) doing very well.  However, I am continued to be surprised by how many women don't really know anything about the disease, how young it can strike, that mammograms don't always catch it.  We expect our doctors to always know what tests to order and when to question results, but that doesn't always happen.  One of my doctor's thought I was being a bit paranoid.  He reminded me that when one hears hoof beats, don't look for zebras.  I think we all want the doctor who knows when to look for the zebras.",
