We had a moment of sadness and tears and then my brother cracked a joke about telling my Mom who was 82 at the time and in denial about her poor hearing.  He said \"oh great, we'll tell Mom that you have breast cancer and she'll say what...Mary is the best dancer...no Mom, Mary has breast cancer\".  We all laughed and it set the tone for how we managed the diagnosis, treatment and survivorship; with some grace, some grit and lot's of humor.  I left it up to them to tell their own children and other close family members, (a brother who lives in another state, cousins, aunts, uncles).  I am a single mom and work full time, I decided not to share my diagnosis and treatment via social media (i.e. facebook, instagram, blog, etc..) I felt like I needed to circle the wagons and concentrate on my health and treatment and not gt distracted by all the (well-meaning) questions, comments, and associated curiosity...I did however, tell my boss who in turn told my co-workers.  I waited about a week to tell my boss because I wanted to meet with my BS and Onc to make sure I understood my pathology and treatment plan.  He was extremely supportive and we came up with a plan to decrease my work load so I could manage that and chemo at the same time.  All my co-workers were extremely supportive as well and were more than willing to help whenever I needed it.  I did ask my entire work team to keep the diagnosis confidential due to the nature of the work I do, we didn't want anyone to question if I could get my projects done well or on time and we didn't want clients to be concerned about the quality of the work as well.  Because we had a plan in place and there was a lot of help and support those issues were never any concern. It's important to note that I work from home so didn't have to travel to and from an office everyday and didn't have to worry about people seeing me with a wig or bald, etc..When the time was right I did tell all of my local colleagues. Of course I told my closest circle of friends as well since we've know each other for many, many years and I knew I would need their support too.  The day of the diagnosis I texted them and let them know we'd get together when I knew more details.  And...that leads me to Cancer Class.  I held two, one for girlfriends where I explained all the details about my diagnosis, treatment plan, and prognosis including pictures and diagrams along with all the information I had from the BS and the Onc. We made it fun, everyone brought yummy food and we laughed and they learned about what was going on and what I would need from them.  This way I only had to explain once to this group of people.  The second class was for my large family; siblings, spouses, significant others, nieces, nephews and anyone else who wanted to join.  Again, this was a way to explain everything to everyone one time and let them know the kind of support they could provide.  I wanted to make sure everyone had all the facts straight, that I was in control of the information they got, and that it was right.  Both \"classes\" worked great from there we traveled the journey. This is a very personal decision, this is what worked out really well for me and my personality and way of life but different strokes for different folks.  Everyone has to decide what will be best for them and help them get through treatment, regardless of how decide to manage this challenge do what works best for you and your family. You will be great!  Peace and healing to you.              ",

I think the delivery is important; getting it in a calm and comfortable atmosphere by someone they trust is important, giving details based on what they can handle at their age is probably a good option as well. Taking the time to think about how you may handle it can help you and them, of course you may not be prepared for all the questions but you know your kids best and you'll do what is right for them I'm sure. My boys were 17 and 26 at the time, one at home another in a city about 300 miles away. I told the youngest in person and told him my diagnosis and then said \"I'll be OK, and you'll be OK and we'll be OK\"...I was hoping to reassure him (and me) that even though this was scary news we would get through it OK. We live a pretty quiet lifestyle so I was also sure to say that things may be out of the ordinary for awhile (visitors, people bringing food, coming over to help clean or organize) and that we'd handle that too. I told the other one via phone because I didn't have a choice and said almost the exact same thing; we'd all be OK. Prior to calling him I called his long-term GF to make sure she was available to hold him up so to speak after our call. It worked best for us...and like you we are all very open and can discuss anything - everything, so the open communication was the best way to go. If you feel the need perhaps consult with a counselor or trusted advisor (especially because of the anxiety). Perhaps letting them know that they can be as involved or not as they need will help...maybe knowing that they can help you get better will ease their minds. Maybe making tea, or a shopping list or bringing you a pillow while you rest is way for them to be of help. Most of all reassure them that you will still be mommy and will do as much as you can to keep things as normal as possible. You all will figure it out, it may be difficult at first but once you have a clear treatment path and have some information you will be in control and it will fall into place. Hugs..",

This is a scary time, take someone with you to see surgeon, an extra set of eyes and ears is important along with moral support. Take notes or have your extra person do that, don't get too overwhelmed. They will be giving you a lot of information, some of it hard to grasp. Try your best not to use Dr. Google, definitely not something that would be helpful now. Take some time to think about how you want to tell people, your family, friends, work, etc..think about how you will handle this journey, think about the kind of help you might need and circle the wagons. I am sorry you had to join the ranks of BC cancer warriors but you've found a safe place where you can get good information and positive support. Stick with us...you'll need a place to vent or just come to visit on occasion. You can do this! Keep us posted.",

Everyone has something positive to add based on their own diagnosis, I also agree with the take some time to breath option. I was diagnosed on July 3rd (2 years ago) and I had to wait over the 4th of July holiday and weekend to meet with a breast surgeon. It gave me time to wrap my head around the diagnosis and get prepared for my first appointment. Take someone with you who can take notes and/or remember things you may forget because of anxiety and nerves, write down any questions you have right now (you will have many, many more in the days and months to come). If you are not comfortable with the current track ask friends, family, someone you trust for suggestions on a different surgeon or oncologist. My primary care physician suggested a surgeon and onc from a local integrative cancer treatment center. I made an appointment but one of my closest friends called a former in-law who she knew had \"insider\" knowledge on good Docs; turned out that I was seeing the local \"dream team\" already so had peace about the upcoming visit. Having some time to think allows you to make plans like how you will tell your family, how you will deal with work issues, how you want to forge ahead and face this journey. There are great articles on the site to help you understand some of your initial questions. The beginning is the eye of the storm, it will calm down once you know more about your diagnosis and pathology and treatment options. It is a scary and daunting place to be right now but please know that it does get better, in the meantime we are here for you to answer any questions and help ease the way. Best to you in the days to come.",

I had a core biopsy and didn't have any lingering effects. A cancer diagnosis can be sad and scary, if you need to cry or have some anxiety to move through the unknowns going on right now just make sure you are taking care of your immediate needs, sleep, nutrition, and getting the support and love from your family to help you stand up and fight any diagnosis. The first few days are definitely difficult but once you meet with a breast surgeon and/or an oncologist and get a treatment plan in place things start to feel less scary; there will always be some stress and anxiety. If you feel like you need to ask the Docs for some meds to take the edge off then do it. This is a time when you need to be a bit selfish and take care of you first...then you can consider what comes next. I will guarantee you that if you have cancer there will be people here who have very similar diagnosis and treatment plans and you can get A LOT of support and advice. Being strong will come later and you will figure this all out, know there is a light at the end of the tunnel. I hope you get the best news possible and that you travel this road with peace. Best to you! ",

There were two things I heard from my Onc. that led me to that regimen \"we are going to be aggressive with your treatment because we want to give you 30 or 40 more years\" and \"there is no reason you won't live the same lifespan as that of your family tree\" (mother is 83, grandmother lived to 84, great grandmother lived to 99)...that was all I needed to hear to move forward. I do have hypertension that is well controlled and had a heart scan/MUGA to make sure my heart was in shape to manage the A/C. My test results were excellent and we moved forward, I am aware of the risks however, the benefit definitely outweighed the risks for me. I have two fantastic sons, a large loving extended family and friends that I want to hang out with for a hell of a lot longer. I did chemo first, MX second and radiation last followed by tamoxifen/AI therapy for 5 - 10 years. it's been just 9 months since I finished rads and I feel great, and am 1 week out from my DIEP reconstruction. I am an active person and eat a healthy diet...the nursing staff during my recent hospital stay was amazed at how well I got through the major surgery of breast reconstruction telling me that I've done better than most women much younger. Saw my PS just Tuesday and he said you look fabulous and by the way that is a great boob! He may be a bit biased however... My point is that even after A/C, Taxol, I feel great, look great and have the same love of life I had before...I have not aged one bit beyond the natural aging process and I am looking forward to being given the gift of aging!! Everyone has a different experience with chemo and other treatments and you may feel older after in body, mind and spirit but you can recover and do well and thrive beyond BC treatment....best wishes to you.",

I am sorry that you are having to deal with this during the holidays, it just adds an additional anxiety factor. I am responding because I have dense breasts and had 2 mammograms/ultra sound with a BIRAD 4 result as well. They watched the \"distortion' I had on my breast for a year and after the third set of pictures they did an MRI and a biopsy. I know it's so scary right now but once they have a clear understanding of what you might be dealing with you can have a specific treatment plan (or not given the results) in place and that will help calm your nerves. While you are waiting you might check out some of the articles on this site...gather up all the questions you might have for the doctor and bring someone with you to your appointments if you can. I was where you are at one time and it does get better, knowledge is power; find some fun things to do to keep your mind off the testing and know that you have great support and resources here if you need them/want them. Feel free to ask any questions or just vent. This is a really great place for any and all of that. Keep us posted.",
