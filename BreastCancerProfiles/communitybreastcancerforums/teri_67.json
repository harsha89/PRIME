Which i did religiously. My skin just will not heal, ive now been told that i have to stop using the violet. And let my boob air dry, and keep it dry. Im at my wits end i cant get it to stay dry, itll dry up and then start weeping again a few mins later. My life is now ,sitting watching tv holding my boob up. (Dr told me to do this while my husband is running round the house like a lunatic trying to fix dinner after a 12 hr day at work. Its not fair. And i hate it. This has bound to have happened to someone, i cant be the only one. Please help!!",
