You will find reliable and helpful information in addition to encouragement and support from many BC warriors! Search for HER2 triple positive and you will find a number of posts. As Kicks mentioned, your BC type, grade, stage, etc. determines treatment. My first set of doctors recommended chemo for 6 months, surgery, radiation, and hormone pill for 5 years. I went for a second opinion and decided to participate in a clinical trial. I am 6 months into my treatment; I get an infusion of Herceptin and Perjeta every 3 weeks (no chemo). I take Arimidix daily. Side effects have been minimal and I've been able to continue working full time. I had 2 tumors and enhancements on the outer quadrant when I started treatment; no tumors or enhancements were visible on my last MRI on Feb 22. I meet with surgeons next week and am leaning towards a bilateral mastectomy. You will find a HER2 triple positive diagnosis overwhelming at times. Information is your best friend, ask lots of questions and stay strong. Sending prayers and hugs, take care  ",

This site has the most current info and the experience shared by everyone will provide the support you need. The first couple of weeks after diagnosis is scary with all the info and treatment options to consider but you must be strong and remain positive! Try not to freak out until you get all the facts at your oncology appointment. Information is your friend, don't be afraid to ask questions and I strongly urge you to get a second opinion. I am participating in a clinical trial and experiencing great results. There are success stories all over this community and you will be one too! Have faith and fight with everything you have. Your precious kids will be your inspiration. I will keep you in my prayers. Sending hugs, take care",
