We are looking to permanently move from California to Texas to get treatment at MD Anderson. Right now I have state health insurance pre-cancer since I was a poor student. Now I'm just a equally poor cancer patient with a degree, haha, with good health insurance (thank you CA) unable to work. I've been researching all the companies & policies that are accepted at MD Anderson and just don't have a inkling on how to navigate what isn't going to leaving me on the streets or dying because I can't get treatment. I'm stage IV with TNBC brain, lungs breast so it's not just a history of cancer or a slower growing cancer. It grows in cm in weeks. It's extremely aggressive to say the least. Monthly cost for coverage doesn't matter (treatment so far has cost over $500k gross ...thank you current insurance) since it pales in comparison to out of pocket costs. Does anyone have experience they can share in this? What did you do? Any insurance companies you suggest or things that are specific to stage IV cancer? I see policies that seem ok, but there's fine print that exclude cancer, which, I thought was now illegal...can't turn away for preexisting conditions? Can you get insurance once you are stage IV? Because of the brain stuff I'm not able to work right now so we are on one income and our family makes sure we are ok, but obviously cost is still a big factor without insurance. I've seen cancer insurance, but that's just as confusing and I don't want to waste money. I'm 30 and giving me a few years to live is crap and I'm not going to let money kill me let alone this cancer. Also, how did you make the transition of care from one state to another? I'm afraid if we move I'll have to wait months to start on treatments again. How do we do this smoothly? I'm afraid of getting there and being stranded and left to die because it's so costly for treatment. Please help!

      "Content": "Jul 23, 2018 03:11AM - edited Jul 23, 2018 03:22AM by Parrynd1 Love stories. I have one to share as well as some thoughts from a stage 4 young woman's view.  My partner and I met on an online game. We are gamers and nerds, but the chance of us individuals it only meeting and falling in Love is so small. Some background on him: He is first generation Indian (like from India) and they do arranged marriages. He spent his whole, albeit 18, years of life telling himself he was going to have this one person he would spend his life with, love, and experience what he was brought up to expect to experience (school, career, marriage, kids). Sheltered with a close knit loving family. He never had a gf, dated, or allowed himself to be attracted to women sincerely he found it pointless. They weren't going to be his wife. He was in his first semester of college, pulling all nighters, and only played this online game bc a friend begged him to. He is very shy and generally doesn't go out of his way to reach out to people he doesn't know. Some background on me: Grew up in a very Christian household where my parents were divorced, were abusive, substance abuse, and generally wa eft to raise myself. My mom thought technology is the devil and everyone online is a serial killer/rapist murderer. I've dated, was a few years older and just trying get by in my tender age of 20. I had never played an online game only PlayStation games (thanks Dad) starting when I was around 12. At the time when we met I was working 2 jobs and only looked into this online game bc it was free and I didn't have a PlayStation anymore. Somehow we met one day and had kind of a crazy experience with this group we were in then went our separate ways. Then we met again in another group and started talking. Talking in game led to talk through instant messenger to texting to talking on the phone. We developed a relationship long distance, but during the 2 years he was getting his associates degree he would come visit every few months if he could. His parents knew nothing. He felt like he would be disowned since I wasn't Indian. My mom knew nothing since she isn't crazy and think she everyone is bad. They did meet eventually when I was having issues with my roommate. Jen came up to help me while I was at work since she started damaging my stuff and putting my dogs in danger. I was at work the night shift when my mom drove by only to see the front door open and screen door shut. She ran inside just as he was walking out of my room in a towel. She was screaming at him and telling him to call the cops (she of course didn't have a phone). Eventually they both calmed down and figured out what was going on. I got 2 very interesting voicemails while I was at work that night to say the least. Luckily they hit it off and talked for a few hours. Now how his family found out about me was very different. The day he finished his degree he told his parents he not only had a girlfriend, but he was moving to another state to go live with her that night. They were very upset. It had been 2 years at this point, but they didn't disown him like he thought they would. Side note: he has the most amazing family and to this day I don't know why he felt this path was best, but I understand his logic. They supported him and just wanted him to be happy. Mostly they were upset he wasn't going on to get his bachelors degree right away. We lived together for a few years till it was time to finish and get his bachelors degree. At this point we knew what we had was not only real, but we work as a couple and partners. We moved together to a new city where he spent the next 5 years in school (architecture is one of the few degrees that's is 5 years :( boo). I met his family and they are my family now in my heart and soul. We planned from month 4 of our relationship to get married, but it would be when we were stable, done with school, and could afford to do whatever we wanted. This would only be a 1x thing. We both have very strong commitment values in this. His last year on school is the hardest. Thesis year. A few weeks before this FINAL part in and seemingly endless stream of schooling I found out I had breast cancer and had 9 months left to finish my own bachelors degree. We were devastated, but positive. I really feel like few people find what him and I have together. We never moved out of the honeymoon phase even though we have had to work on things in ourselves and our relationship. We have the same thoughts all the time, can laugh, and be stupid together. We see each other with all our flaws and accept the other for who they are. I know soul mate is cliche, but he is why that phrase exists. I took a break from school to kick cancers butt. Chemo kicked my butt though and his mom stayed with us during my treatments every other week for the year and a half till I was done and just needed to do radiation. I couldn't feed myself, or even shower for the first 7-9 days after chemo. She did everything and is a godsend of a woman. Everyone pulled together to help me. His brother in HS took care of himself while she was 4 hours away taking care of me. His dad had to do all the work for their long haul trucking business on his own. And the two sisters in college would drive home alternating weekends to help grocery shop and do anything else. My partner wanted to take the year off of school, but I knew he would miss graduating with his friends and honestly what could he do? Watch me sleep and be a zombie? Plus he had a full time job since I couldn't work. He was so strong for us even though I know he was barely keeping it together. He never once got mad or was insensitive about me having cancer. I felt guilty during this time. Like he didn't deserve a partner like me who was sick, but he said he would rather go through this with me than be happy with anyone else even if he had the choice to never know about me. I was NED November 2017. I started back in school before radiation though so in February when I had my 3 month follow-up with my rad onc and complained about a constant headache I had been having for the last 2 weeks. She ordered and MRI and this led to that and I was suddenly stage 4, recovering from a craniotomy during midterms of my own thesis. He stuck by my side. Helped with homework. The family rallied once more. My onc told him and I that statistically my prognosis is I have a few months to 2-3 years before this disease usually takes people. She reminded us we are not statistics and they are going to fight like heck to get us as much time as possible. With this I've asked him if he really wants to still marry me on our 10th anniversary in Jan next year. It would be easier to just keep being how we are, but he never waivers. I have the hardest time with this. I can accept dying. I can accept the pain cancer causes in me, but not in him. I am his world and this I feel like will shatter him. The guilt of what this will do to my loved ones is the worst. He says he will never be with anyone else. I can't think of him with anyone else either, but I've told him I don't want him to have to go through life alone. If he finds some one who he can laugh with and find at least some comfort then I am ok with that. I told him not to push them away because of me. I've come to see this potential person as more of a placeholder since I know when he also dies one day we will reunite. It will be like the beginning of our relationship...it was just long distance for a while till we did what we needed to do and could be together for real. No, I can't imagine or want to imagine him being intimate with someone else, but I also can hold the guilt of denying him that if I'm not there. Those thoughts I don't think about because if they come to pass I won't be here to care. That's how I've been coping. I think it's important to let a partner know these things as well. I'd hate for him to struggle internally because I didn't say how I felt on the topic of him moving on. I'm not ok with him being with other women, but this cancer stuff isn't either of our first choices. It's not like he has the option to be with me and is choosing someone else. We are all just trying to do the best we can with the cards we are dealt I think. You aren't a place holder. Everyone dies eventually and some way earlier and more unfair than others, but at least we get to have that connection and feel that love for however long that is. You will always be special and significant to him. Fight because it's unfair. Fight because one more day is a day closer to a cure where women won't sit here online and grieve over the stolen time from their husbands, children, and family. Fight, take those 27 medications that make you feel like crap, eat healthy because your loved ones are also fighting a battle for you. This isn't one-sided. It's ok to cry and be sad over this. It's a sad thing. I don't know if I will ever accept that I'll die soon. I'm scared. It doesn't feel real. I still cry a lot. And I think it's ok to acknowledge those feelings and thoughts, but equally important to acknowledge the good. You don't know how much time you have. No one does. You could get hit by a bus tomorrow. You could live another 40 years and not know what happened to the cancer. You can be thankful for every smile you have or given, every moment that left you in awe, each time someone showed that humans have an amazing capacity for love. You may not be in control of the fact you have cancer or where that might take you, but there are good things you can control...you just have to let the good in so the bad doesn't overwhelm you. Not as easy as it sounds...it takes practice and I still struggle some days. Good thing we have forums, lol Sorry for such a long post. That's our love story and my thoughts on him moving on after I'm gone. I hope it helps someone out there. Cancer makes you think a lot.",

Going anywhere after my stage 4 dx has been tricky with infusions, scans, doctor appointments, SE\u2019s, medications and other limitations brought on by this disease. We never know when a new treatment will be thrown in or how it will affect me in terms of side effects, let alone the schedule - 2 weeks on 1 week off, every other week, or a combo of the 2! This makes it hard to not only get out there and live life, but scary to leave the comfort of my emergency room and the little pharmacy I have in my house (not really but it feels like it). I haven\u2019t found a good place to talk about how anyone has made their travel plans? I\u2019m hoping to plan a honeymoon this year, but feel scared and overwhelmed.

There have been times where I haven't been about get up off the floor and currently can't drive due to vision loss..another big factor for this travel stress. In honor of those who can't I do want to do what I can while I can as I know that's not the case for everyone. I've alwasy been a go go go type of girl tiring out everyone else, haha. Building in rest time is very smart I've already made a note :) and I like how you think of the emergency part of it...sounds less stressful that way. I did go camping this year and go visit our parent 4 hours north but that's been about it. For the wedding we are flying to San Francisco to do an English style wedding and then on to Canada to do a traditional Indian wedding. I'm praying I have the energy and health to do it all! I just started a new treatment this week and will have another infusion next Monday right before jetting to the airport. Am I do this right!? Who knows but I'm getting out there at least is how I see it. Where have you gone internationally? I'm looking for some good tips as I still want to plan our honeymoon. Nbnotes great tip on the insurance I'll have to check it out. Look at your globe trotting Africa sounds so great. I'm glad you got to go! Someone I know was planning a safari and had to put down a 70k deposit in case they needed to be air lifted out safely (her husband has many health issues and they ultimately cancelled the trip) so I haven't even looked in to that. There is this place you can stay while on a safari (my information is lacking so sorry in advance) where giraffes will wander around freely and you can feed them. It sounds magical. Did you get to see any animals? What all do you do in Africa or on a safari? Did you need specific vaccines? Have you ever had a problem taking your meds with you? I'm nervous about having something illegal I don't know is illegal and the. I get very stressed about not knowing everything! Thank you everyone for the great responses so far. Below is some pictures from that camping trip this year. Hope I can add to them with more travel.   ",

If you can go back sooner then cancel the plans. If not then you had it taken care of ahead of time and maybe an extra day or 2 to rest, even if you feel ok, isn\u2019t a bad thing. You may feel fine, but your body is still healing inside where you can\u2019t see or may feel. Wouldn\u2019t hurt to take it easy if you can. Hope it all goes well for you.

Some advice I got from my brother helped bring my stress down at this point was: \u2018Don\u2019t worry about the what if\u2019s, worry once it\u2019s a fact\u2019 It could be so many things, and if it is BC then there are things you can do. You have options. It feels like your world just crashed, but it will keep going. You\u2019ll pick yourself off and begin your battle plan. The worst part is waiting for scans and biopsies and appointments.This might be the start of a new journey or it may be just a scare. I think of it like money. I refuse to spend my emotions on what I don\u2019t know. Doesn\u2019t me mean I can\u2019t educate myself, but it\u2019s does mean I won\u2019t cry myself to sleep convinced I need to write my will tomorrow (ok, honestly I have done this... it takes practice to think yourself out of that place). Luckily you found these forums. This is a good place to find comfort, info, and connect with others. Especially on those sleepless nights. I hope your biopsy shows it\u2019s benign or some small easily dealt with thing :) here\u2019s to hoping the best outcome for you",

Sounds like they are taking no chances and making sure you get this figured out soon - which is awesome! I honestly wish I and my first doctors had more of a sense of urgency when I was getting diagnosed. You live and learn I guess. Wishing you luck with the biopsies :) following the cold pack instructions really does help it feel less sore over the days afterwards.",
