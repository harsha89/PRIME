It's from a recent People Magazine interview with Dr. Funk from the Pink Lotus Breast Center: She was discussing Rita Wilson's stage one cancer. Dr. Funk said: \"Once you have breast cancer, if you do a mastectomy the recurrence rate in the skin or muscle or armpit lymph nodes is about 4 to 6 percent. That number can be cut in half by taking an anti-estrogen pill, but it requires some monitoring. If you think about it, every woman walking has a 12.5 percent chance of breast cancer. And so the recurrence after mastectomy is less than a third of everyone else of getting their first cancer.\"  ",

I was hoping to try tennis and jogging again and am looking for suggestions for sports bras and prosthesis that are very secure. (i.e. so my foob doesn't fall out in the middle of a tennis match.) I have the TruLife Leisure form size 3 but wasn't sure if a heavier form would be more stable/secure during exercise? Or maybe the opposite is true? Many thanks!

I went on Amazon to look for an electric razor and saw that the electric razors had mixed reviews. Can anyone suggest an electric razor that has worked well for them? Or if there is a regular multi blade razor that would be ok to use? ( My MO suggested Nair, but I am trying to avoid chemicals ) Many thanks.
