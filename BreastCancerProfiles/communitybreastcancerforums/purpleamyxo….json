Family friend had BC 13-15 yrs ago (in her 20s), had chemo then after 5yrs hormone therapy she's had 3 kids. It recurred this year, but it was small and only in the breast and she is back on hormone therapy. She stopped having check ups and only went for another one after my mum was diagnosed. A cleaner at my work had it around 15 years ago. She had 7 lymph nodes positive, chemo, mx on one breast, and was part of a trial. She is doing well, no recurrence I did a teaching placement (im studying teaching) and the teacher I worked with mum had breast cancer 14 years ago, chemo, multiple nodes and is doing well, no recurrence I met a lady who also did chemo for breast cancer 10 years, she is doing well Two of my mums friends are also 5-6 years out and did chemo My great aunt had ovarian cancer 7-8 years ago, she was given 10% survival, she's still going well with no recurrence My mum was dx with bc a year ago after her sister was dx with bc 2 weeks before her (at stage one). Mum was stage 2b er+ pr+ her2 - she had 1/26 lymph nodes and did chemo. She is 45, her sister is 51",
