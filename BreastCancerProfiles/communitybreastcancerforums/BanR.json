I really dont want to go to the extent where i have to need blood transfusion..my chemo interval is 2 weeks, maybe thats why my body is not getting the chance to recover. he mentioned Taxol wont cause haemoglobin dip, what has been your experiance? thanks again!!",

Thanks Vivian...will discuss the medicines with my doc too! sorry to hear about it luke.. i believe they skipped chemo for you in the first occurence, thats why it recurred. Was yours hormone negative or hormone positive..i realise sometimes that cancer is such that even with chemo there is no 100 percent assurance. This time, they will go aggressive with chemo and it should go. i am 35, have my husband and 5 year old kid at home....terrible to go through this at this age.",
