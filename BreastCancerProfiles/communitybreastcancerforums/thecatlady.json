My PET scan was clear, so I think pain had to do with my right expander. I had never had a PET scan with expanders before, and it was on the right side where I have mild lymphedema. But that was such a relief that there was no cancer visible on that side. Yesterday was a bit crazy however. I had my triweekly H&P and had a severe reaction to Perjeta. I was having trouble breathing, when I would take a deep breath I had a wracking dry cough, my hands turned bright red, and the nurse said my eyes were red. My oncologist immediately stopped the Perjeta (I had about 3/4 of the bag) and started IV steroids. When I got home I had to take 50 mg of of Benadryl and slept most of the day. When I got home my lungs were hurting, I thnk from all of the coughing. I feel better today but still feel like I have been sick. Just run down. My oncologist said she would continue the Perjeta with benadryl and steroids before I start treatment, but now I reallly just want to be on Herpcetin only. But that is also a bit scary because I do not want a recurrence.",

The tech told me it could be an indicator of cancer. Has this happened to anyone else? This was after I got the radioactive sugar (about 30 minutes after). I got diagnosed with stage IV HER2+/estrogen Sept 2017. Metastases were only on my left lung. And it spread through my blood and not my lymph system. My pet scan this summer showed NED but a mammogram done in July showed DCIS in my right breast. So a year and a month after my original diagnosis I had a double mastectomy on October 3. I know there is a risk of mastasteses after mastectomy so I was wondering If anyone else has had a similar situation I am on maintenance Herceptin and Perjeta at this time and I am supposed to be on it indefinitely. I had six rounds of chemo (taxotere) last year from November 2, 2017 to February 16, 2018.

Did your Mets come back even when you were taking Herceptin and Perjeta? I noticed your recent taxol chemo last month. Did it spread again? Just don\u2019t know what to expect. My doctor acts like I won\u2019t have any additional mets on H&Pbut I have wondered how long it lasts. Like walking on egg shells.",
