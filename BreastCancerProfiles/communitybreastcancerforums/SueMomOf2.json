In the beginning of July, I noticed a lump and also a hard section next to it on my right breast.  As I am 40, I was already due for a mamo and had an appointment scheduled for 8/20.  Rather than wait that long, I called my obgyn and got an appointment for 7/15.  She sent me immediately that day for a mamo and ultrasound.  The radiologist said that the hardness I was feeling was a 'cluster of cysts', and the lump appeared to be a fibroadenoma.  She recommended a biopsy to confirm that.  She said it was no rush and didn't seem concerned.  I booked the first opening they had for a biopsy and got that done on 7/31.   After waiting 8 days for results, the Dr. called me on 8/8.  She said that I have another fibroadenoma, BUT some 'atypical cells' are present.  Her exact words were 'atypical lobular proliferation'.  She said that this was 'NOT a cancer', but the lump should be removed.  She said that since the biopsy only gets samples from a few places in the lump, there may be other 'atypical cells' nearby that are of concern and this could be the 'tip of the iceberg'.  She gave me the number to call to make an appointment with the breast surgeon that is part of the medical group.  I called immediately and was able to get an appointment in a week.  So, I will be seeing the surgeon in 2 days on 8/15.  I am not at all sure what this means yet, or how serious it is. I tend to be a very anxious person, and I must admit that this waiting is killing me!   I can't focus on my job, and I'm trying to act as normal as possible around my kids so they don't see how stressed out I am.  Not easy for me.... To make matters worse, I am supposed to be on a plane to Disney World on 8/23 and won't return until 9/1.  This is a trip with 10 extended family members that has been planned for over a year.  My mind is going through all of these 'what if' scenarios.... like what if the surgeon looks at my lab report and says this lump should come out ASAP and she wants to do it when I'm supposed to be away?  On one hand, I know I'm being ridiculous and obviously my health is more important than my vacation.  But on the other hand, quite honestly, the thought of telling my kids that I can't go away with them is killing me.  This is all they have been talking about for weeks.  The waiting is so frustrating... wait for the first appointment, wait a couple weeks for the biopsy, wait a week for results, wait a week for the first appointment with the surgeon, etc.  I know that waiting a week here and there for things is perfectly reasonable and understandable, but it sure seems to add up!  I am just trying to think positive and hoping that it won't be a big deal to wait until the beginning of September for surgery. If you're still reading, thanks for listening to me vent, and good luck to the rest of you out there who are in the same boat! Log in to post a reply",

The surgeon wants to see me again in 6 months, and of course, I will continue with my self exams (which is how I discovered this lump) and yearly mamograms.  The surgeon peeled of my steri-strips today and I have healed nicely and was never really in any pain.  For anyone out there who is worried about a biopsy or lumpectory, feel free to ask me any questions.  I was worried about both, and both ended up being much easier than I anticipated.  ",

For anyone out there who is concerned about getting a biopsy, I can tell you it was a piece of cake compared to what I expected, so try not to worry!  Only a small pinch when the needle with the anaesthetic went in, and then I didn't feel a thing.  I watched the procedure on the ultrasound.  I was good about using ice on and off for the next few hours and only took some Tylenol as a precaution in case I'd be sore when the numbness wore off, but I may not have even needed it.  I have very little visible bruising.  I even went to an amusement park 2 days later and went on roller coasters with my family (got the doctor's ok before doing that).  I had no problem at all... just needed to skip the water rides.",

The surgeon is a woman about my age, so I felt comfortable with her.  She says she has seen plenty of fibroadenoma lumps that had 'atypical cells' on a biopsy report that turned out to be nothing, but of course the only way to know for sure is to take the whole thing out to be tested. She said it was perfectly fine to do it after my vacation.  Unfortunately, I will need general anesthesia which I don't look forward to from past experience (but that was 20 years ago, so maybe it's better now).  She said I have dense breast tissue around the lump and she didn't think it could get numb enough with just a local. Apparently dense breast tissue is common for someone \"my age\"... fun getting older, isn't it?",

I was in a similar situation myself last year.  I found the lump myself, immediately called the Dr. and had the mammogram and ultrasound.  The radiologist said it looked like a possible fibroadenoma, and recommended a biospy.  The biospy came back showing atypical cells (atypical lobular proliferation, to be exact).  The Dr. said it wasn't cancer, however, more atypical cells could be nearby that were.  I was advised to get the lumpectomy which I did.  Everything turned out fine, and it was just a fibroadenoma.  My advice to you is to just get rid of it.  More than likely, everything will be fine.  I agree with Juliecc, peace of mind is definitely worth a scar. Good luck with everything.",
