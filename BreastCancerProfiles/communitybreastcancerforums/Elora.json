Of the percentage of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, my understanding is that most are actually neither BRCA1 nor BRCA2.  Most unfortunately remain in the 'cause unknown' category.  With your concerns I would strongly urge you to speak with a registered genetic counsellor who is fully versed in these dynamics and has the training and experience in this area to guide you through possible testing and treatment options. I can appreciate this is an unsettled time, considering what your sister has gone through at such a young age and your also feeling a cyst concern.  With this I'm a bit surprised your physician authorized mammography prior to at least age 30.  There are strong (preventative) reasons for not having this done at a young age, as it involves radiation and on still developing breasts.  Another option is FDA-approved breast thermography.  Baselines for this are recommended starting at age 20 and then annually after that, and later in tandem with mammography.  It's important to get a thermographic facility referral through a compounding pharmacy to ensure the related technicians are well-trained.  (I personally hope that someday there is a full replacement for the mammography radiographic tool being used on those with high risk for breast cancer.) No matter which route you choose, I wish both you and your sister the very best.",
