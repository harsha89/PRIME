Changed and waited just a few minutes before technician came and got me. They told me the first treatment would take a bit longer, but I was dressed (after I slathered up with aloe Vera in dressing room-technician said it was ok) and back in my car by 2:45. A few things I noticed-although I have a hospital wristband I\u2019m to wear every time, no one scanned it or even asked to see it. This was different than the chemo center. I was scanned, double checked by 2nd nurse, asked my name and birthdate and then had me verify my name on chemo bags. Much more relaxed at this center. Halfway through radiation I noticed the machine seemed to move to theleft side of my body (it is my right breast that needs radiation). So I start thinking \u201cwhat if they have the wrong patient? What if they think I\u2019m someone else and they are radiating wrong breast\u201d. Of course I had to tell the technicians after that I noticed the part of the machine that seemed to be aimed at the left side of my body. They reassured me it was all about the angles. I guess I just always need SOMETHING to worry about! Moth- We DO have similar dx. I think I was so quiet on the boards during chemo because I was so overwhelmed and out of it much of the time. I did read when I could the Feb chemo thread and was so thankful for those of you who posted.",

Slightly pink, but no other irritation. I guess my biggest complaint is the fatigue I felt, and still feel. I\u2019m hoping to push through that and ramp my excercise routine up a notch or two. I\u2019m also feeling a little bit of \u201cwhat now?\u201d Being triple negative, my active treatment is basically over. I see a NP next week for a \u201csurvivorship care plan\u201d appointment and have a 3 month visit with my MO in October. It just feels strange because I have had daily or weekly trips to the center since February. I should be happy that treatment is finally over. And I AM happy. Just feeling a little lost I guess.",

After the nurse took my vitals she checked my breast and mentioned how she noticed it was getting a little pink. (I had just finished telling her -\u201cnope. No color change yet\u201d) When I got home I could definitely see my radiated breast was a slightly pinker shade than my other breast. So it begins... Other symptoms-fatigue. When I mentioned how tired I was to RO and nurse, they both felt it could be partly due to radiation and partly due to lingering SE from taxol. I am 7 weeks PFC so that makes sense. We discussed exercise. I am so anxious to get back into pre dx shape, and my body is just not cooperating. It\u2019s frustrating. As far as the actual treatment goes, I have to agree with what others are saying. It is quick and painless. I decided I was going to take a 10 minute catnap while on the table today (I was THAT tired). I closed my eyes and got in to a meditative state and next thing I knew, the technician said \u201call done\u201d. Seriously. It was that fast. I have read complaints about the noise the machine makes but I am able to tune that out",

My treatments are in the afternoon. I want to keep my breast moisturized, but I know I can\u2019t go to appointment with lotion on my breast area. So do I moisturize in the morning and shower shortly before appointment? Or shower in the morning and not put anything on breast until after appointment? Or am I just overthinking this whole thing?

And since radiation burn come from the inside, drinking lots of water must help. So I carry around my liter bottle of water and refill it several times a day.
