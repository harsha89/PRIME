I have an appt with the oncologist on Tues. but as usual the waiting is horrible.  The other thing I have is a kind of \"surety\" that this is a recurrence.  Seems my intuition is telling me the worst So, my questions are:  what were your symptoms of recurrence if any?  And did you have a sense or intuition that it was back before the diagnosis happened? Thanks for any words of wisdom. Tammie Dx 8/27/2007, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 6/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Tumors were positive, positive, negative.  The surgeon stated that mixed type is relatively rare... she had not seen it before.  I had 5 treatments of AC, 5 treatments of Taxol, finishing in Feb of 2008.  No radiation.  Had expanders placed in July of 2008, currently anxiously waiting the exchange to silicone implants on Dec 1.   I am 45, happily married to an orthopedic surgeon, have 2 children ages 6 and 10.  Needless to say, my world has been rocked in the last year.  I am interested in talking to anyone who also has mixed type breast cancer.  Is the chance of recurrence higher?  My oncologist assures me that we have this beat.  Just want some more reassurance.  Thanks for listening, Tammie  Dx 8/27/2007, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 6/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
