      "Content": "anasamara28 wrote: Hi all, I was diagnosed with PASH December 2011 (18yrsold) and was given the options of surgery to remove or wait and see. I didn't want an invasive procedure at the time so opted for the wait and see method. I did some travelling for most of 2012 and when I returned in March 2013 had another ultrasound which showed that the PASH had grown. The previous largest dimension was 3.9cm and the new largest dimension was 4.7cm. I was still told there was no need to panic and put it out of my head as there was no pain and I was also heading back overseas for another few months. In the last month or so I have been doing my own research as I was getting a bit suspicious of the lump and was sure it was still growing. I am arranging to see a specialist in Brisbane in the next couple weeks and just wanted to know if anybody had any advice on my case. From what I can see, everyone is unique and what worked for somebody may not work for another. Having said that, Is it unusual or bad that I left it until now to potentially remove it? I have been reading lots of stories about it growing and deforming the breasts (I am an E cup) and other cases of PASH returning after removal. I sort of feel that the severity of the situation wasn't explained to me when I was first diagnosed and had I know that it could create a dramatic cosmetic difference I probably would have got it out sooner. Any advice at all or your own experience would be greatly appreciated! I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place of leaving it to it's own devices, Paying up-front for surgery in Australia or waiting another 3 months til I return to NZ and then removing it if need be. -Ana Log in to post a reply",
