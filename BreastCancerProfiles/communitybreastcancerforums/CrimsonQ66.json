In addition to the IDC already biopsied. That changed our plan from lumpectomy to MX. There can be a very good reason to use the MRI first. My surgery is May 27th.",

Day 3 was my bad day--absolute fatigue and unable to sleep. No nausea, vomitting or even queasiness. I have great spurts of energy and then I bottom out. My hair started shedding on Day 14---a bit earlier than I expected. I commented to my coworker that my hair was falling out--she said it didn't look any thinner (I have thick hair). I told her to hold on a sec----I spread paper out across the table then shook my head over it. We both laughed when it was covered with hair. I guess I have plenty too lose. I'm really hoping to make it through the weekend with my hair. I have a pool party on Sunday and am just not ready for THAT to be my breakthrough moment of showing up in a wig, a wrap, or a bald head. I may not have a choice. My scalp seems to ache---somewhere between a sunburn and pins and needles. When it started I predicted that my hair would start its retreat. I have been lucky to avoid the acne for the most part. I have a giant underground knot on my jawline, but that's about it. Most of my acne is induced by whiskers---and since my hair is coming out, hopefully the whiskers will go away too!! I have found the my skin is much drier and crepe-ier. Bringing on the heavy moisturizer. I don't recall my MO saying anything about alcohol, but I will admit to have a glass of prosecco the other night and it tasted FABULOUS. Since just about every beverage tastes like crap, bubbles are my saving grace, usually just sparking water. But the prosecco was such a divine indulgence. I guess time will tell when I get my blood work done next week. ;-) Best wishes to everyone getting their time in the lounge chair this week!",

My greatest issue outside of the absolute fatigue that others have discussed is constipation.  The chemo really locks things up for me.  I have had Mirilax and Colace and I wasn't satisfied.  As I gear up for round 3 on Wednesday, I am going to add something else to my bag of tricks.  Someone recommended Milk of Magnesia to me.  I tried it this weekend.  I think it may do the trick.  It kind of sends things the other direction, but I would rather be \"loose\" than not go at all.

It is important to get your colon awake and moving for optimum comfort. You CAN do this and it will be OK. You will be surprised at the inner strength you can summon when you most need it.
