      "Content": "MichelleMME wrote: I was diagnosed with DCIS in the right and LCIS in the left breast back in June of 2013 at the age of 42, both stage 1. I had lumpectomies on both and with an addition surgery a month later to remove 3 lymph nodes on each side due to the pathology report stating they found some invasive cells. Nodes came back clean and I then started radiation. Since then all has been good. I felt very fortunate. This past February, 2 months after my check up, a red pea sized lump showed up on my right areola. I went in for another mammogram and an ultrasound. Both looked fine and my doctors felt the red lump was due to changes in my ducts/glands. I followed up with my oncologist at the beginning of May and there had been no changes to shape or size of the red lump. Recommended to just keep an eye on it. Since May my right breast has changed significantly. It has shrunk in overall size (DD to D), has become firmer and lifted higher on my chest compared to the left (I was very symmetrical), my entire areola has become hard and 'swollen' to make my nipple appear inverted, and the whole top of my breast is hard and sore (areola to half way to chest wall). I emailed my doctors, no response yet, but I am trying not to freak out. Could these changes be 'normal' for my age and having had radiation and lumpectomies in 2013?

She is not pushing one over the other since the Create-X study showed better results for triple neg and the study was primarily done on asian decent woman (I am white). So she is leaving the decision to me and need to let her know by end of this week. I too am curious to hear from those that are taking it for residual ER+/PR+, HER- and what SEs they may be experiencing. I am unsure what I want to do at this point.",
