Of course, then they gave me a Rx for a cream (biafine) and tell you to use Aquaphor (OTC by Eucerin) twice a day.  Might as well just be vaseline - don't know how that's going to stay dry?? jules - my RADs nurses said I could use any deodorant that didn't contain aluminum - they recommended Toms' of Maine.  Got it at CVS for 5 bucks. milena - let us know if you chose whole breast or mammosite.  I was offered a clinical trail that was 50% mammosite and 50% whole breast, but I decline the trial and went whole breast.  I'm really curious about the mammosite, though.",
