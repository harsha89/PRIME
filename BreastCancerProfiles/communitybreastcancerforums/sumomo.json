Maybe their activeness is more important than their count, and some exercise for the good blood flow would help our immune system. Just a thought. Hi Sassa. Thank you for your comment. Good to know you rarely become ill. How encouraging that I should be fine with low WBC. Many thanks, and take care!",

I just found from my recent bloodwork that my white blood cell count was still very low, even lower than when I was tested three months ago. According to the info available, it seems the recovery takes a few months to six months at most, so mine seems to be a unusually slow case. Has anyone experienced the same? Log in to post a reply",

I would like to know when it was for everyone, so that I can have some idea when I will get better. I will greatly appreciate your input. Log in to post a reply",

I had some numbness/tingling during the treatment but it's getting worse after completing the treatment. I also started having some muscle pains and feeling weakness in my thighs. Anyway, except for hair loss, would the numbness/tingling/pain/fatigue normally get worse after completing the treatment? When is the worst, e.g. 3 weeks after completion? That was what I would like to know. Thank you.",
