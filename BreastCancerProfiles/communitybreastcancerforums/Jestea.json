The ultrasound report came back stating that there is dilation of ducts in both breasts with lots of small cysts??  With the little bit of research that I have done on BCO, a few dilated ducts are common but all of them??? Feeling lost and frustrated!!  Testing doesnt happen again until December with a MRI scheduled... Thanks for replying Kim, it is much appreciated.  Big hugs and God Bless x",

Clear Mammo and US, FNB-b9-Unsure of actual pathology.  2007-Woke with a large sore golf ball size lump behind nipple.  When the nipple was squeezed a large amount of green pus would expel.  Same 2 years later.  Both had clear Mammos and US.  2nd time was biopsied and came back fine....6 months later and I had a gallium scan for fever, tiredness....Report stated 'Inflammatory process or Malignancy in Tail of Right Breast-MRI recom', MRI-Reported 'Area of Enhancement in the inner lower quadrant' (Opposite to Gallium findings???) Was sent for a MRI guided biopsy which came back with ADH.  Surgical biopsy revealed ADH, Complex Sclerosing Adenosis, Complex Sclerosing Lesion and Columnar Cell Lesion with Atypia.  Sooo then on to 6 monthly monitoring.....  Dec '11 MRI - Patchy parenchymal enhancement in upper outer quad bilaterally-b9 hormonal enhancement??, Intramammary lymph node seen centrally in R close to chest wall and unchanged.  June '12 Mammo and US- Lots of small cysts in both breasts.... My R breast, armpit, shoulder, chest wall and arm has been very sore for about 6 months now with a definate thickening in the whole armpit side of the breast with a small lump that you can now visually see near the junction to the armpit.  Nipple continually has a 'let down' feeling and also has a thickening when the nipple is erect, it is a vertical thickening that runs towards the armpit.  The nipple also has a constant white crust on it...And some of the thickened part has a goosepimple sort of feeling to it....Cant sleep on the right side and if I sleep on my stomach the breast feels as tho it is full of a net of knots?? Upper arm measures 3cm larger than L arm??? With a fairly large lump in the upper armpit, sort of down towards the arm... So my questions are:  If you had clean imaging before diagnosis, how were you diagnosed??  Also, how many of you have had that 'gut' feeling that something is just not right??? I stated the gut feeling to my BS a few weeks ago and she just shrugged her shoulders and stated that until something shows on imaging, she cant do anything???  I have been researching both ILC & IBC and I have a few symptoms of both???  Any advice would be greatly appreciated  xx Log in to post a reply",

I travelled over 1000kms to get another opinion when I had my last set of surgery in June 2011 and the BS more or less told me exactly what my BS is telling me....the only other thing he stated was that with so much going on in my breast, my chances of getting BC has now increased to around 20% instead of the normal 10%??",

And you may be laying on your stomach for a little while? There may be a little bit of pain and swelling after the procedure but make sure you keep plenty of ice on it afterwards for at least a few hours. Good luck with your biopsy and I have my fingers crossed that it comes back b9. ",
