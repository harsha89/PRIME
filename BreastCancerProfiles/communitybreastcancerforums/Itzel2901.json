In the month of November last year, I was experiencing pain on my right breast with under arm back and collarbone and underneath pain. I did a self breast exam and found lump. Went to dr and he said he was sure it was just a cyst. But ordered a US . The US results came back as a cyst , and It said catagory 3 probably recheck in 6 months. But now it's 2 months after and I am feeling that while discomfort again and my anxiety is super high! I have a diagnostic mammogram and another ultrasound scheduled to get a second opinion. I just don't what to think anymore. I wasn't sure this pain can come with cyst.",
