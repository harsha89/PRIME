So far so good although I know they say the side effects can kick in after 2-3 days. I had weekly Taxol for 19 treatments and tolerated it very well. It was time to change chemo due to mixed response mostly in the liver on my last P.E.T. scan 3/2019  of course it would be great to hear from others on Doxorubicin liposome. Thank you!",
