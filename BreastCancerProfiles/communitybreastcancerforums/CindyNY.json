My RO and her nurse explained everything and more on what to expect. They went over my CT scan & tattoo markers; skin treatments - lotions to use, deodorant; weekly x-rays while on the table for rads; and weekly meeting w RO. Please don't be terrified, rads are doable. A pain in the posterior but doable. It took me longer to get undressed & redressed, than the actual rads being given. I wish you the best!",

First thing I'd recommend is getting a copy of the pathology report. This will give you a lot of information. Secondly, I think your mom is overwhelmed and you or someone else should go with her to Dr appts. Being alone you miss a lot of what gets said. Also start a note book, write down what you know from pathology, and write out the questions you have. The oncology team will have more information. I'm assuming they're meeting with her prior to any node removal. Its at this time you can ask them any questions you have. Best of luck to you & your mom.",

I was told that if she needed more tissue than anticipated I'd end up with a MX vs the LX. I trusted my surgeon and told her I was good with it if that's what she had to do to get it out of me. She was able to leave my breast pretty much the same, probably a larger divot, but nipple intact. Chemo would be decided between you and your MO. A lot will depend on your Oncotype DX score - a test on a slice of tumor sent to a lab, given a score on % chances of reocurrance. You can read more on Oncotpe scores on the main site here under the TAILORx results recently published. Radiation after LX is normal protocal. I didn't have a MX but I believe most don't need radiation due to breast tissue being removed. You could ask your MO. You're young, and you will get through this. This is a group no one wants to belong to, but its a strong group of women on this site and all are willing to support you. Best wishes on the reexcision. PS - I'm small breasted. The rads breast looks perkier, not actually smaller.",

So I kind of shouted from the rooftops to every woman I know that I had bc and only found it by US - with no family history either. I let them know if they had dense breast tissue they needed something more than a mammo, or bc might be missed. With diagnosis I did group texts - key once and be done. And copy & pasted to others as texts came in. I'd update as different things occurred. Research, I only researched up to the point I was at (ie. Lumpectomy). Didn't look too far forward because didn't have all the info (ER+ or -). I believe the more I knew the better prepared I was. That's your call. I did wake up at night after 3-4 hours of sleep, unable to fall back to sleep, I'd research more. All the terms and abbreviations were a new language to me. Stress is stress. You do what is right for you. As you can see from posts, each of us took the path that we felt was right for us. You can do this, you're stronger than you know, and you have HUGS from each of us that came before you.",
