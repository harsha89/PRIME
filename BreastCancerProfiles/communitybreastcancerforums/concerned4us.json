I have seen the symptoms for IBC and had some concerns. My first symptom was itching on both breasts. After about 3 weeks of it getting worse I noticed I had a round red rash under my right breast and a red rash in a string on my left breast. My doctor treated me with Bactroban. Instead of helping the rash started to burn and grew. I saw the doctor who then put me on Nystatin. This time the rash on my right breast appeared to be drying up but the skin where the rash was started getting dark like a bruise. Today my doctor started me on Diflucan because my right breast is tender. I also feel full like when you get engogrged but nursing and pumping do not relieve the feeling. As the rash has changed the itching is not as bad. Could this be IBC? Has anyone with IBC had the itch go away as their rash changed? Has anyone had a rash that changed to a bruised appearance?
