It's been awhile since I've been on these boards or else I would have joined in earlier  I've been on Halaven since early June and had great results with markers after the first cycle but since then they've started slowly creeping up. I had scans last week and am waiting on those results. I see that many said you do 2 weeks on and one week off. Anyone do 3 weeks on and 1 off? Starting the wonder why my onc put me on 3 weeks. Didn't realize when we started that 3 wasn't the norm.",

I've never posted before and even took a hiatus for several months but am desperately seeking some answers.  I started Tamoxifen January 7, 2014 and found out a few days ago that my tumor markers have tripled. My liver counts are still normal or close to normal though. I also finished 10 days of external radiation on January 7th to my pelvic bones and femurs. Wondering if anyone else experienced what I'm praying are tumor flares. If so, how much did your markers increase and how soon did they start going back down?
