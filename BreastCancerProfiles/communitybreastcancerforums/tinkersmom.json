I too am going in Jan 5...the posts about how to prepare are priceless...i would like to hear about how yall are conquering the fear, during the day im ok, but sometimes in the middle of the night its like a very cold wave, and i can do is chant to myself how very lucky i am. It was caught early, I have good insurance, great support system in coworkers, relatives, and friends. and one other thing, how can i help my husband fight his fear too...i know its there, its in those rib crushing hugs ive been getting lately. thanks again, sheryl",
