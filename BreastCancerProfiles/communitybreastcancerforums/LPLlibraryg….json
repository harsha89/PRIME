I was very lucky to escape skin issues during my 20 sessions, but I couldn't evade the dreaded shoulder problem. I thought I would share my experience since reading that several of you are having some shoulder trouble as well. After surgery (and even now) I would find that I was holding my left shoulder tensely, without even realizing it. When I noticed the tension I would relax. Over time it must have gotten worse because by the time I went in for my simulation it hurt a lot to raise my arm. The techs made a mold that cradled my shoulder, but didn't really provide any comfort. It got worse throughout the radiation treatment. I took ibuprofen and acetaminophen everyday just to make it through radiation. I saw the breast cancer PT who helped with lymphatic massage and guided my exercise, but the shoulder got worse. My RO referred me to an orthopedic doc and after waiting several weeks I saw him on Friday. The dx is that I now have a frozen shoulder and should have some PT (another 2 week wait, unless there is a cancellation). Geesh! I read that frozen shoulder occurs at times of unusual stress. Emotional stress increases physical tension which can lead to myofascial trigger points (frozen shoulder, migraines, back pain, knee pain, jaw pain and maybe more). Stress keeps muscles tight! And makes it very hard to get a good night's sleep. The doc prescribed Naproxen 500mg so I am taking that for pain and inflammation. I am also taking acetaminophen and eating more anti-inflammatory foods. I wake up in the night a lot with shoulder pain so I am hoping this will all help. My hospital offers a gentle (mostly chair) yoga class that I am taking once a week, as well as a gentle exercise class for bc patients. I am not sure what my advice is for those who are experiencing shoulder issues, but I hope you can avoid a frozen shoulder! Congratulations to all who have finished RADS and good luck to those who are making their way through it. I am thinking of you and sending gentle hugs.",

What a sweet gesture that your facility gives a handmade pillow to all of the RAD grads! DeeDee, you finished too. Well Done! I hope the blisters are healing. TC73 you are almost finished too. Hang on for a couple more days. And when it's over...it's not really over. Continue to hydrate, lotion, exercise and rest when you can. Heather, I was lucky to have an easy time of radiation, at least with skin issues. I'm sorry to hear about your aches. With me, it was my shoulder. Stretch when you can. Welcome to so many new people! You will find great advice and support on this thread. Wow, lots of teachers on this thread. Has anyone studied which occupations have the highest incidence of breast cancer? I am curious (and a retired teacher and now working part-time in the children's room at the library). Good luck to all of you, especially all of you who are working through radiation and taking care of your families.",

I've been done with RADS since New Year's Eve but I still like to check in and see how everyone is doing. Keeshondmom, I did the breath holding too, but without a picky tech. Of course, they just want the best results for you but that tech's behavior seems odd. Each time I went in I had to do one or two practice breaths and the techs would tell me if I needed a deeper breath or needed to let some air out. Good Luck! Faceforward, I was worried about your scary start but it sounds like everything is good now. Thank goodness! Suzyshacklechick, I did the Oncotype test and felt it (or something similar) was considered routine for everyone. I remember being told not to worry about it, then it came back saying I would benefit from chemo! I think everyone might have been a little surprised. After that test the MO decided I should also have genetic testing. In the end, primarily due to my age, I decided to decline chemo. My MO supported my decision, which was a little hard to make. She did say that taking an AI for next 7-10 years would be super important since I wasn't going to do chemo. I told my BS I was going to flip a coin because I couldn't decide what to do. He said no, no...go with your heart. So I said no. If your onco number is low it might be reassuring to you and if it is not low then you have to make a decision. Best wishes with whatever you decide. We all make the decision that we think is best for us at the time. I'll probably worry about my decision because I am so good at worrying! But, if I didn't do the test I would worry too. re: creams- I have mentioned Jean's Cream before. It was given to me every week at my RO appointment and I think that there was a clinical trial for the product at my medical center a number of years ago. I haven't heard of anyone else on this thread who used it but it worked well for me. I still use it once a day. http://www.jeanscream.com/home/ Dani, stay warm. I hope you have some hot cocoa planned for your evening. We get the arctic cold tomorrow. They are already posting delayed openings for schools in NH tomorrow. Take Care everyone. ",
