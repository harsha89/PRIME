    "Content": "anativeangel wrote: Hello! I am just wondering if anyone had a similar experience to mine? In June I had my first mammogram and it was abnormal. I was called back in for ultrasound which showed three enlarged lymph nodes that they said were probably benign. I was told to return in 6 months. About a month ago, I noticed a very faint dimple on my breast under the area where the nodes were found. A few days later my underarm swelled and was very painful. I went to my ob-gyn that is currently watching a complex ovarian cyst. He felt and said he thought would be OK but would check again in a month. So I just felt like I was just being paranoid. A couple days ago I noticed the dimple has gotten almost 2X larger. I still have yet to feel a lump. My imaging reports said the nodes were deep in the axillary tail. Any ideas or similar experiences. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
