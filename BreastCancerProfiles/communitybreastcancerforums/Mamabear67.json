My doctor is pretty cautious because of all the cysts I have. I'm sorry I don't have the report from the mammo but I'm sure I could get it. I'm so use to having to go for the ultrasound that it's never a big deal anymore, until this time. Now I'm pretty scared. Can you explain some for the findings? I see some of the words you have on your list of not such good words. ",

I have a lot of cysts but no big deal. This time after the ultrasound they called me for a second ultrasound. They were concerned about an area in my left breast. This is what is on the report: Additional evaluation was performed for the area of altered echotexture in the left breast, 2 o'clock seen on 11/6/2018. On the present examination, there is an irregular avascular area of altered echotexture with indistinct margins measuring 9x11x8 mm in the left breast upper outer quadrant at 2 o'clock located 8 cm from the nipple. Internal echogenocide is hypoechoic. There are decreased posterior echoes, edge shadows are excluded. Impression: Area of altered-echotexture in the left breast is suspicious. Ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended. My biopsy isn't until Dec 4th. They also have scheduled a post biopsy mammogram, not sure why? I'm scared!!! Any insight or interpretation of this would be helpful . Log in to post a reply",
