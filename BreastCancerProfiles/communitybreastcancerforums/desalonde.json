I have read lots of medical articles going back years and consulted 3 rad oncs and it seems clear there is no consistent \"prescription\" even for same person.... different docs give different opinions depending on where they trained so a lot of it is culture and custom not hard science about what is minimum effective dose. That means making decisions with blinders on. What is worse.... RO may be ( mine is) defensive and irritated when you quote a literature info of concern to you and insist that you\" trust\" their experience......even though they disagree among themselves and may contradict the literature. It's primitive and makes me mad because women deserve better science to reduce the suffering that accompanies these treatments! I'll be very interested in hearing posts from women who can shed some light on this and please share your experiences of what dose rads you got... whole breast or boost... and the results and how far out you are.

I think you have a much better surgeon than me however... seems he laid out the options, clearly and respectfully. My surgeon of nice enough but when pressed for details and risk she gets fuzzy and in the end I found she minimized the risks and possible problems I may ( and did) have post op. I do not regret electing lumpectomy over mastectomy. I was prepared to go in the mastectomy direction if my MRI indicated either other areas of cancer in same breast or add'l early cancer in opposite breast. But my MRI was interpreted as negative for any clearly suspicious lesions. In terms of RT, I just finished last week the 36 sessions.I really struggled with accepting the necessity of doing RT post lumpectomy . I suspect from my review of the studies-most of which are retrospective and data quality is not detailed enough to differentiate stage of cancer, types, etc - that not all women are 30% risk of recurrence without RT..... but who is? There is a lot not known and it does seem to me that RT post lumpectomy is \"generally\" better than no RT; boost added to whole breast better than no boost at all; hormonal blocking meds ( if ER positive) better than not..... However the potential and significant risk of SE from Rads both short term and years later is something that was minimized by my RO to the point of interfering with transparent information in my experience... and when I hunted for my own info, it was scarry what can and does occur as SE of the RT treatment itself.... so it's a risk and information is limited  in the studies how large is the risk, how to minimize, and who is more likely to have risk... and many RO go with a one size fits most approach. My RO offered... 50 Whole breast to all then 10 or 16 boost.... no other combos. Yet in other RT centers there are different practices and DOSE and the combo of WB to boost and total dose does impact not only recurrence risk but also known SE such as fibrosis, neuropathy, arm muscle stiffness issues, lymphedema and how much Rads the unintended normal tissues get also. There are also different options for how RT is delivered. IMRT, 3D, partial breast.... but if the RO you consult doesn't have experience with it they won't offer it as an option. Go to a place which can offer you the most options and talk to 2 RO from 2 different institutions , read, then make your best decision you can . Happy to help in any way with what I learned along my difficult journey.",

It's hard to make a choice when you don't know a lot of facts because there are just a lot of unknowns for possible problems with rads and also for Mastectomy/recon. And I learned that many RO's either don't explain or don't understand themselves the less common but seriously quality-- of life altering issues that rads can introduce to the existing BC diagnosis. Yes I want survival but I want to get best survival WITH quality of life and they are really poor about figuring that into their advice or allowing patient enough info to make a truly informed decision...Ultimately I decided lumpectomy and rads because as the nurse from Main in post before said, there are multiple steps, possible complications there also, and takes many , many months to complete. Where I really struggled was whether to permit the higher DOSE rads my RO wanted vs what a RO consulted out of town advised as sufficient. I went for higher DOSE and pray I have no disabling SE in future years. I also know many women decided to do double mastectomy however and there are happy with their decision. God bless and guide you. You and all here are in my prayers.",

      "Content": "Mar 2, 2014 03:12AM - edited Mar 2, 2014 03:14AM by desalonde I finished last boost of Rads course yesterday after a 2 day delay caused by my fear of going to higher dose and the real distraction and priority on helping with arrangements for my son's care after he flipped his car on ice and sustained a fracture to T12 vertebra in his back. He is in so much pain but -thanks God- not paralyzed. Now that I have completed total dose 6640 as I was prescribed by my RO who was impatient and condescending throughout this grueling period, I am scared still of long term side effects most especially plexopathy which can cause arm and hand disability a decade out. I read about encouraging pilot study on trental ( pentoxyphylline) and vit A as a prevention strategy against fibrosis( which they think leads to late effects on lymph and nerves) and asked RO about it, showing him the literature I copied for this. He would not even look at it; lectured me that \"all meds have side effects and I won't use it unless you have a problem\" ( although literature says that after problem with fibrosis related late effects noted, it is difficult to impossible to make any difference). He said it's an off label use of that med and I won't prescribe it to you ( although he admitted he uses for other off label situations such as non healing open radiation related wound) and although docs are the only ones allowed legally to do off label use as done with many meds ( anticonvulsants are used for chronic pain for example). I feel so angry. I am happy the RT is behind me but hope that I am not haunted by side effects later. There is way too little attention given to this in research and in full information to patients . Sorry for the negativity. I really am trying to be positive now and look forward to starting the tamoxifen which I was advised to begin 2 weeks post RT. That med has way more risks than trental but I have no problem taking because the benefits I read about are unequivocal to me. I am choosing to take Tamoxifen first 2 yrs then Aromatase inhibitor(AI) last 3 yrs so I can delay the bone thinning impact expected by AI's..... been reading up on the options and the combo routines work as good or better for recurrence rates. By the way Sisters, using creams post rads.... read the labels... I was astonished how many include parabens including utterly smooth, carmex for extra dry skin,many others. READ the detail. Not everyone believes parabens are a risk but if I have an alternative will avoid that ingredient .",
