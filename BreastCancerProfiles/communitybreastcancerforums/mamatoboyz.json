My mind is all over the place. When I went in for my second mammo the tech was so casual \"so do you have a history of BC in your family then?\" Uh no! \"Well it could just be early BC\". I started to cry & she said \"Oh my gosh, are you OK?\" I know they do it all the time, but really...its our bodies they are dealing with, our lives, right? They told me that my Dr. won't have the results for me until April 14th so I'll have to wait until next Thursday to hear anything!!! OMGosh!!!",
