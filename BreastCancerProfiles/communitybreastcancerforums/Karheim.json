My breast cancer was dx as stage 1 0/2 nodes grade3. I had lumpectomy and was told just radiation but then they did a mamoprint and it came back high risk so now chemo. I dont like even taking aspirin now i will be infused with toxic chemicalsðŸ˜± The side effects are really freakin me out. Im afraid i will not be able to handle it esp when my hair goes. Im going to be doing taxotere and praying my hair comes back. I also have to work. My income is all commission based with no vacations or sick days. Im so afraid of catching something esp with how bad the flu is here. I just want to hole up in my house until its over.ðŸ˜ž  ",
