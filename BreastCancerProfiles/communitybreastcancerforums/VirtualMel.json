I wish they had just set a definite time like they did for me. It was hard, but at least I had an appointment that was certain. I hope you find out soon, for goodness sakes! Do you like to read? (I get lost in books, and that's my therapy...and walking....whatever burns off steam to keep you distracted.) How'd it go today at work? Did you make it in?Remember 80% benign rate while u continue to wait. Hugs! Love, Melanie",

For tomorrow for a fast, precise surgeon, and nice, distracting people to keep your mind off of anything. It really will be over before you know it and you'll be waiting again like me. :) Hugs, love and prayers! Melanie",
