The other CMF is less toxic but you have to be on for 6 months and will lose hair for sure. Im going to google both...but was wondering if anyone out there had one of these chemo regimes and what their experience was like? I have a 2 year old son so its gonna be hard to care for him if Im getting sick a lot (he is in day care 2 days a week) but I have no family where I live. I live with my boyfriend...any info helps! thanks.. And how soon does your HAIR fall out? after first session? Any recommendations for wig websites?

How serious is this when the neutrophils drop this low? are you all talking about Clariton the over the counter allergy med to take? weird that would help with bone pain...but hell I  will take whatever to get rid of side effects...  ",

      "Content": "Jun 8, 2015 11:32AM - edited Jun 8, 2015 11:36AM by mircann Hi Ladies- Thanks for starting this June thread... I started my first CMF chemo session last Wednesday. The session almost put me in a panic attack and it turns out it was from the steroid they gave me...so I had to float thru that panic attack during the drip and then drove home almost real giddy and hyperactive from the steroid. So after talking to the RN and pharmacist we wont do the steroid next time..I hit the bed at 7pm that nite and couldn't get up and felt like my brain was half working and felt like I was on qualudes or something..the next day was better. By Sunday I was extremely exhausted and now have a horrid cold with a mucus tsumami...lol. I can barely move I am so wiped out..not sure its from the cold or the chemo or both... So is it true I heard your body starts doing a pattern of how the fatigue plays out..as I have a 2 year old I have to watch and we are also going out of town to a reunion in mid July and hope to get that July infusion around my vacation so Im at my best and best energy level..any thoughts on this..I am brand new to this...   My Dx is mastectomy April 22, 2015 - DCIS and dime size tumor (ICIS), stage 1, grade 3 tumor, 0/2 nodes with zero cancer. ER  +/Prog - / HER- thanks!",
