The tumor was 2.4 cm. but feels like it has grown in the past two weeks. Arm pit has been very sore for a long time and noticing pain in collarbone area. I already hate all the test and having to go to drs. I am so worried about financial stuff I already want to call it all off. How can a person get through this and keep their sanity when I am already so tired doing a days work is taking all I have. Total exhaustion have invaded me. I also have MS and other health issues. If I don't work I can't pay bills and won't have insurance. What am I going to do? Dx 12/19/2012, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
