      "Content": "Mar 5, 2011 09:39PM - edited Mar 6, 2011 11:36AM by Sereena I was diagnosed 12/10/10. Had 2nd surgery to obtain clear margins and to sample a few nodes on 12/28/10. Initial quick look at the 4 nodes were negative. Pathology came back 9 days later and 3 of the 4 were positive. 2 nodes were micro and 1 node was macro (5mm). So on 1/25/11 back to surgery for more lymph nodes and all 22 were negative. My onc did not recommend chemo. WHAT??? Did the oncotype dx test..score was very low at 10. My ki67 was only 2%. He took my case to a clinical tumor board where 10 oncs and a chief of oncology (who is world renowned) all said NO chemo. I would only benefit 1% and at best 2% from chemo. Not worth the risk of severe side effects. The side effects nullified the benefits. Hormonal therapy is more beneficial. Even with all those top-notch medical opinions I agonized day after day and night after night but in the end I decided w/no chemo.I spent hours and hours on the computer, on this site and anywhere else I could gather information. Do your research. I am 52 and post-menopausal which also contributed to my decision.  It is a personal decision and a difficult decision. Good luck!",

Initial examination of those nodes was negative. 10 days later pathology came back with 3/4 nodes being positive (happens 1% of time)....guess that means I'm not carrying any lucky charms. As a result I had to go back in for a 3rd surgery to remove level 1 and level 2 lymph nodes to learn the extent of the \"C\" invasion. 22 more nodes and they were all negative. Thank God!!! Pretty painful recovery from an ALND:-(  I had my tumor oncotype tested and it came back with a very good score of 10 so I did not do chemo. I would have only had a 1% and at best 2% benefit. For me it wasn't worth the risk I am now taking arimidex, 3 months now, with very little side effects, those being just achy joints. I can live with that. Ibuprophen is a good friend of mine now!!!!",

Standard of Care is to have chemo in that case but for several years now, research is leaning towards no chemo for post-menopausal women with low grade, low oncotype score even with some node invasion. If you do a little research you will find this to be true. Here in Boston/Dana Farber they feel the standard of care will be changing soon. Cancer doesn't always mean chemo. It was hard for me to swallow at first but after my own research I was comfortable with no chemo. Go into my profile and you will see where I had started a feed on positive lymph nodes and no chemo. There would be some good info there as I think some of the girls posted links on the subject. BTW.....I still have a 16 year old at home! My other 2 are married (27 & 30).",

I am putting together a list of questions for both the BS and Oncologist who I will be meeting w/on Tuesday. Thanks for the links. I also had a 2nd area removed that only had clear margins on 3 sides and because the 4th side was right up to the skin (not free of cancer cells) she is not doing a re-excision. I'm thinking that should be concerning! Why leave it in there?",

If you end up having to have a ALND then he/she would be removing nodes that they do ALL the time. Less risk of any problems such as unecesssary nerve damge. I was fortunate enough to be at a Breast Center within the Dana Farber network so my surgeon, MO and RO are all doctors specifically for breast cancer. Of course, I'd rather not know any of them but I feel I am in the best place possible. Best wishes for you!",
