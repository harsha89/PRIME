    "Content": "Kayloveslife wrote: I had a lumptectomy on 4/29 and then my breast care team suggested an MRI (5/14).  My surgeon just wanted to return to get clean margins and take 2 lymph nodes on 5/16.  MRI was done on 5/14 and found some 'other stuff' so surgeon cancelled  surgery until an MRI biopsy was done. There has been much delay since ~ and it's working on my stress.  I' m told the tech is a new tool, few doctors can perform (usally one day/wk), they need their own RN to assist etc.  It is now scheduled for 6/27.  I'll probably return to the original plan of surgery but feel like I'm contributing to someones research.  They say this is a new tool ~ does this route sound familiar to anyone?
