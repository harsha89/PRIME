Was told things seem to be holding their own whatever that means. As far as the leaking told it is up to my doctor to decide further treatment. I am picking up my films tomorrow to take home with me as we'll as digital disc. Should I pursue it further or bloody discharge means nothing and just wear a pad?",

Last mammogram was 2006 as we didn't have insurance and no problems and did self exams so didn't feel a problem. I am out of state this week taking care of my mother who has MDS cancer. Problem started while out of town so called my family practice doctor who recommended I see someone immediately so went to insta care and he ordered mammogram. Now heading home and have an annual physical scheduled for the 8th of July. What type of doctor do you recommend you said breast doctor? I was thinking Surgical Oncoligist. Should I request a MRI or something else. This is all new to me never thought about breast cancer being anything other than a lump. Thanks for any help or suggestions or direction.",

Her thought was we can do an ultra sound and a MRI but it isn't going to tell me anymore than I already know. You have what I would guess is a benign palpaloma in a duct in your left breast. 90% sure non cancer but there is that 10% and based on past results lets just remove it. I go in at 6 am tomorrow to have my duct and growth/tumor removed.",

Last Friday while traveling to take care of my mother who has MDS I noticed that my breasts started feeling like milk was letting down. My breasts became tender and engorged. Last Friday I noticed that my left breast was leaking clear and bloody fluid. Monday my right breast started leaking clear but mainly my left breast is leaking more. I contacted my general practice doctor to schedule a complete physical and explained my breasts. Since I am out of town for another week he insisted I see someone immediately which I did. This doctor expressed concern of breast cancer and immediately scheduled a mammogram. That was done yesterday with lots of digital pictures. They noticed two areas of concern. Left breast was leading blood and a growth behind nipple. Right breast calcification. Told they needed to get my past mammograms to compare and that might be just scar tissue. They said they would call or send letter with results. I said if cancer just let me know, they said they can't tell me. Results are being faxed to local doctor and out of state doctor. What should next step be? Can't they check fluid? Will fluid tell them anything? If biopsy is needed what type doctor should I see? I live in a real rural area so need to find doctors just not sure what type other than general. What type doctor do you recommend? Sorry this is so long, worried, impatient and need answers so I can be prepared when I get home next week. Any help is appreciated. As a side note all the tissue they removed in hysterectomy and breast reduction came back diseased non cancerous. Still engorged and leaking. Log in to post a reply",

Went back to PCP and he did breast exam and asked if I was comfortable with clear mamo and bleeding stoppage. I said no due to the info I have read on this and other sites, bloody discharge was caused by something, not saying cancer but answers needed. He then did blood hormone testing as he thought lactating hormone was out of whack. He then said do not cancel Breast surgeon appointment as other hormone levels are off. Not sure if I should be worried or not as I don't know what this all means. Wish they would have taken a smear during mamo when they saw I had a bloody discharge. Going to insist on MRI any other suggestions? Wish I had answers for you.",
