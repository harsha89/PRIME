    "Content": "rayofsunshine wrote: Hi everyone, hoping for some tips (and I guess some reassurance, too :)) I am in my early 30's. Two years ago, during my regular yearly exam, my primary doctor found a little bump in my left breast. Wasn't too concerned because I've grown up with little fibroids. Never had them imaged b/c they go away on their own. Doc insisted I have it checked out. Had a mammogram - too dense to see - so they did an u/s. Radiologist found a 10mm - probably fibroadenoma- at the surface and gave it a birad 3, check back in 6 months. By then it was 14mm & becoming more painful. Mostly it only hurt when I accidentally bumped it or rolled over on my stomach during sleep. He gave me a pamphlet about managing breast pain and said I could have it removed; otherwise there's no reason to come back for another u/s. A year later, the pain is now more constant, and radiating to my shoulder blades, armpit, rib cage, waking me up at night. Went back to rad & it was the same size. The rad sounded annoyed this time, telling me I should go see a BS and I don't need to go back to see him until my 40 yr mammogram. Pretty sure I am not going back to him ever again. I felt so foolish after that, I almost didn't have the courage to see a BS. Met w/ BS to see what kind of surgery it is to remove a fibroadenoma. She did an ultrasound in her office but couldn't locate the lump in the size/position that the radiologist specified. After getting a more detailed report from him, she managed to locate it, but found additional pieces extending all the way to the back of my breast, near the chest wall. She explained that's probably why it hurts - but couldn't tell via the u/s whether I have a cluster of lumps or one big lump with pieces extending out.  She asks why I haven't ever had this biopsied (nobody told me to) .  She explains the excisional biopsy, saying she'd have to go in through the side of my breast because of the depth of the lump, explained how the anesthesia works, etc. She explained that it takes 5 days to get back pathology results. She said it would be purely to remove the lump(s); if she goes in and finds evidence of \"c\" word, she will schedule a follow-up surgery to handle that separately. Well, nobody's ever said the \"c\" word to me, so my brain kind of turned to mush at that point. In my mental fog I asked her \"so, this lump with more lumps on it, is that just a normal thing?\" and her answer is just \"well, let's just say it isn't completely abnormal, but I want to see a full pathology\" . When I told her I'd get back to her about scheduling the surgery, she emphasized that I should have this done soon. I asked if I could wait until the Fall & she said she strongly recommend against waiting that long. Now I regret not getting more details about what she saw on the u/s, but at the same time, even if it's totally b9 I still need to get it out because of the pain.  Sorry for the super long story! This just happened this week, and it's been floating around in my brain, and I am still a little freaked out.  I decided to take a breather and schedule it after the holiday weekend.  Part of me is in preparation mode - wondering what the biopsy will be like, and how I can prep to make it as easy as possible when the time comes. And the other part of me is grappling with that not-knowing-limbo that I hear so many people describing here. And another part of me is feeling so suspicious...if the radiologist missed something like that, how can I trust that this BS is any better? I asked my primary doctor what she thought, and she said to do it because it will relieve the pain, but not to worry about cancer because cancer isn't painful.  Thanks for listening...anyone had similar experiences? Or can anyone make suggestions on things that they've done to prep for surgery that made a good difference for them (before and after)? I heard that having a sports bra is a good idea but that's as far as I am right now.  Log in to post a reply",
