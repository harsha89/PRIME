I am a keen runner,(in fact was diagnosed just 3weeks after running the London Marathon,talk about a bolt from the blue!)and am wondering about what it is like to run with a prosthesis(or, indeed without) Is it possible/comfortable to run longer distances with it in place etc,  also other exercises etc. Please let me know if you are a regular runner!
