The cancer came back and I had a lumpectomy in April and then started on Taxotere and Cytoxan. I was supposed to start radiation this week but my radiation oncologist noticed something suspicious (that everyone else had missed) on my February PET scan. I had the PET scan redone and those suspicious spots are two areas of cancer that are now larger. (One in a mammary lymph node and the other behind my pec muscle.) The tumor board is meeting again on Monday to discuss whether I need surgery, more chemo (probably Adriamycin), or to just zap it with radiation. I'd appreciate hearing from others who might have experienced this same thing to hear what worked for them. This cancer must be pretty aggressive.

My doc liposuctioned my thighs (covered by insurance) and did some extra fat grafting in my breasts to round them out. Right now I look like I was hit by a truck! I've never seen such bad bruising - thighs and lower back. I was already happy with how I looked after stage 1 so I'm just praying I haven't messed things up. I'm very swollen but this too shall pass!",

Now I've had a recurrence in the left breast and I'm going to be starting radiation at the end of July. I'm finding very little information about the effects of radiation on a DIEP. I think it's probably in my favor that it's two years later. Any DIEP ladies out there who had radiation after DIEP? It sounds like maybe I could have some fat necrosis develop and maybe some shrinkage? I went through a lot of pain and money to get great cosmetic results (NOLA girl) and I'm sad that I might lose that. I love that every doc who sees me can't believe that I've had a BMX because they look so natural.

I know everyone is different but it makes me feel so much better to read that you didn't experience any change. Makes me feel like there is hope! I will be having full breast plus supraclavicular nodes and internal mammary nodes radiated-30 sessions. But first I have to get through one more chemo, which all in all has gone better than I expected. I should be done the week my kids go back to school.",
