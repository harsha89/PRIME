We married 2 years later, 1st daughter a year later and 2nd daughter 3 years after. Always plenty of love and sex!! Then he had a heart problem 15 years ago and had a double bypass. We decided to take early retirement and move to Spain. First few years were wonderful, then I had my first diagnosis. However, got past that. All wonderful again till last year and MBC. Hard for both of us I know, and intimacy is hard because of my hip pain, but we try now and again!! God loves a tryer!! I dread leaving him alone. I know he will be ok, just afraid of the wolves lying in wait. Hope he is strong enough to cope with them. Please all of you, don' worry about weight. I want some. I'm too skinny. Going to sleep in my part of the world. Good night all. Sweet dream",

Scan done, thanks to 2 very patient handsome male nurses, Jose and Antonio. Vein in my foot worked for the contrast, so only waiting till Tuesday for results. Micmel, I also have a port and do not worry if it shows. Our temperatures from now till mid September will be 90 or higher. If someone doesn't like the look of it, tough. It's part of me, and makes life so much easier for treatments . I also went through times of thinking this could be my last ........, but then I realise that no one in this world really knows when is their last summer, birthday etc because things can happen of which we have no control. As my MIL used to say, don't worry, you could be run over by a bus. So I sort of, put my MBC to the back of my mind as much as possible and get on with living how I want to, and trying to carry on doing the normal day to day stuff. Feel better for it too! Tanya, enjoy your camping. When you reach Morocco you will be so close to me (well, maybe not just round the corner) lol! Thoughts and prayers to Gracie. Lynne 50s, I'm sure your poems were deeply touching. We can all forget how hard it is for the partner living with us. Night night x ",

I am glad it is possible to get help, especially financially, but the most important is a listening ear. I love to hear what everyone is doing. It's good to have distractions. It's good to know that people carry on, even when we have days when you feel you can do nothing. I will get to know you all by name, but keep telling your stories of your lives. Thank you all xxx",

We went to the memorials for The Forces who died building the railway in Thailand that inspired the movie Bridge over the River Kwai. The cemetery just made me so emotional even though I did not know anyone who died there. I'm sure Pearl Harbour would be one of those places too. The old photos are amazing.

I travel between Spain and UK and Ireland, but how I long for real distance. When I was first diagnosed and treated and well again DH and I travelled to Canada,Thailand, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, also within Europe. I realise I will never be able to do all that again, but I am so glad I did. Now I feel sometimes it is just too stressful to think about. Micmel, try not,to think too much about next week. Try to look forward, it will soon be over and done, and you will be on the mend, feeling positive again about yourself. You are a strong woman!! 3 sessions of radiotherapy done this week. Treatment week next week. Sick of hospitals, sick of being sick, feeling very sorry for myself ladies. Know there are others feeling this way. Group hug. Love to all x ",

Like you 50sgirl, when I drift off to that other place, my DH wouldn't know he should let you know, because like you I have made comments here that are not for his eyes or my family's. Hopefully I will be able to comment until near that time, and when it goes silent, you will know. I love the prom pics, you all look so sweet. This was not something that happened in our schools in Ireland. All we had were the occasional school disco, when we eyed up the boys, and thought we were all so beautiful in our trendy early 70s gear. Saying that, I think we were like teenage girls all over the world. My daughters had school \"formals \" similar to your proms. Still waiting for warmer weather, it is a lot,warmer than some,of yours, but not our normal Spanish spring. Going away for a few days next week, so fingers crossed for sun",

Then when they interviewed her she said she had breast cancer which had been successfully treated 2 years ago. I still think she is amazing but people just don't understand what Advanced Cancer is!!!

Leg is,shorter now on right side, so hobbling. Micmel, go for it, you will feel so much better, sounds like you are the perfect candidate. Cheering you along from here. What time zone are you. I'm CET, Central European time. My daughter in BC is 9 hours behind me, so she goes to bed as I get up! You will be less I think. Best wishes to your DH illimae. Can understand your friends feeling. When I popped into Oncology yesterday for denosumab shot, it occurred to me how well I must appear to other people. So many who can't get around or rely on family and friends for everything. Humbling. Night all, 11pm here Micmel, ready to sleep x",
