This website and the community of people here have already been a great help, but I'm confused about preparing for Chemo. Thank you in advance for your tips and compassion. I was diagnosed on Halloween and start Chemo the Monday after Thanksgiving. I met with my treatment team on election day and then I have to spend this week doing more tests and meet with my medical oncologist next Monday, so I don't even have my regimen yet. I spent the days after I got the treatment plan getting more tests that lead to more tests. I only have a little time to prepare (will be away over Thanksgiving). I have some questions about the \"Things to Gather before Chemo\". And the \"Tips Before and During Chemo\" So here they are: 1)I need a brand of unscented moisturizer (other than aquaphor which is so greasy) 2)What is a toothbrush sanitizer ? 3)Unscented hand cream (what is the difference from #1 ) and need brands to look for 4)I need a brand of non-toxic dish soap and moisturizer (this is the third time they have mentioned moisturizer) How many products do I need? 5)Regular Claritin for Joint pain? I thought Claritin was for allergy 6)What doctor is supposed to prescribe supplements 7)Do I really need a blood pressure cuff? 8)Where can I get a seam free soft hat for sleeping? 9)Where do you buy a hair net? Are we talking made of hair or made of polyester? 10)Why do I need slippers, can I wear my tennis shoes around the house? I have slippers but prefer my tennis shoes. 11) Cold caps, I just looking into that today.. so haven't had time to read the material. Why do I need to get a short hair cut? Maybe it will be less stress on follicles when brushing? 12) Are Playtex gloves allright? I read some account where non-latex gloves were recommended, but I'm not allergic to latex and I think the nitril gloves I bought are not high enough for doing dishes. 13)What type of store would you buy the nail strengthener and cuticle cream at \u2013There is Ulta near me is that the right place? 14) So I can't paint my nails after I start chemo? I'm a little confused here. I do not ever paint my nails but if they are going to turn black (not sure yet) then I would like to paint them so my nails don't scare people. Recommend a color or type of nail polish. Does it matter? I usually buy the cheapest, but I use nail polish to label camping equipment, not for my nails. I'm 58, have a 9 year old adopted child. I was diagnosed with the breast cancer that 80% of women are diagnosed with. (I would have to leave this page to go look it up, so I'm guessing some people are familiar with the type.) I am triple negative, I believe.

At first I was going to do bilateral, and then I saw a new doctor and she recommended just one breast. And I had a plastic surgeon who thought I could do Diep for one breast. And that is sort of why I chose one breast. But the next PS said there was not enough tissue there, and I have to agree, I saw what they were going to take off my stomach when first PS drew on me. I would be so tight it would be hard to stand up straight. My fat is on my outer thighs and hips. I just don't have the fat in the right places for recon. I am putting in a tissue extender and then I'll decide if I want an implant or not. I am not eligible for any of the autologous reconstruction and i'm having radiation, so this is my one chance to get a second boob. I'm just trying to figure out which is easier to live with, no boobs or one boob.

I have a ready source of Dry Ice at a Beer store in the neighborhood. Did it work for you? Did all the things you have to do to your hair to prevent hair loss feel easy to do or was it an incredible chore? I have not ordered yet, I probably will, but all the things you have to do or not do during this time are freaking me out. I have fairly thick hair that has never been colored or permed, so I was thinking all that would work for me in using the cold cap. The beer store I would get the dry ice from has done this numerous times for breast cancer patients, which was good to know.
