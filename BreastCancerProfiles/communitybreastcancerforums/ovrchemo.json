Nothing too severe.  Reglin every 6 hours.  No nausea.  Day 5 (Saturday) May not have had 100% of my energy but aches had gone and by Day 6 (Sunday) felt good enough to go out to dinner.  Back to work Day 7 no problems. I can honestly say this is the pattern I remained in throughout my treatment.  There was only one other side effect that I started feeling on Day 2 after each session.... \"chemo brain\".  I'm a web developer and could not concentrate on any complex tasks.  This SE seemed to always start on Day 2 and lasted no more than 2 days... but it did make multi tasking difficult, and I found it hard to hold a conversation.  I just started taking Day 2 off... simply because it was frustrating.  My energy level remained reasonably good throughout (Day 3-4 slightly lower than normal). Day 14, my hair started to come out.  I had had it cut very short, but what little was there was coming out en mass.  This was my lowest day. I had my head shaved on Day 15.  I bought a couple of wigs which I hated to wear because I thought they looked like wigs.  I work from home, so went \"bare\" and wore a scarf when I went out.  Since the weather got much cooler  (I'm in Philadelphia), I've started wearing the wigs with hats... which look quite natural.  Hoping my hair is in by the time our temps heat up again!!! The aches in my legs did get progressively worse.  By my 4th treatment, they were with me most of the time, but they were not unbearable... just there... I noticed them when I went to stand up after being seated for a time (in my knees and shins).  I can still feel slightly today.  My appetite was good throughout. My eyelashes lasted until my last treatment.  I still have a few and as of day 51 post treatment they are growing in fast... I can see them although they are not quite long enough for mascara (maybe next week).  My eyebrows barely survived, I kept a few.  They too are growing quickly.  My hair has started to grow.  I have a nice layer of \"peach fuzz\". Lynn, I don't know how many treatments you have ahead of you but you will get through them. I hope you feel no worse than I did throughout because it was bearable. I kept thinking about my halfway point and once I was over the 3rd one, it seemed like the 6th was upon me and I was done.  If I can answer any other specific questions, please let me know. By the time you read this, your first treatment will be over and you'll be one closer to being finished :-) Kerrie",
