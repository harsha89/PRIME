We don't use the term stage IV. My daughter has asked me to promise I wouldn't die from this. It's hard to look in that little face. She wants a black and white answer and there is a lot of gray. I try to focus on reassuring her (and some days myself) of how competent and confident my medical team is and that when I'm not feeling well it's usually side effects from treatment, not the cancer itself. Whenever a parent dies in a movie, I hold my breath for the questions that usually come. But most days feel pretty normal. I just had my last taxotere, so hopefully normal will become the norm.",

Your choosing to only post our upbeat \"put my best face on\" entries adds to the shame of this disease, whether intentional or not. MBC is scary, it hurts, it's lonely. And it's too uncomfortable for everyone else. I for one am sick of trying to make everyone else feel better.

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2016 11:38AM - edited Jan 5, 2016 11:40AM by Bluefrog76 Cita: My kids are 8 and 11 and I was diagnosed stage IV out of the gate in August. I have been very public with my diagnosis (I posted that decision process on the bone mets thread last night.) My husband and I told our kids once we knew my treatment plan. We started pretty high level, but I answer all of their questions. Some have been much harder than others. My brother in law died at 39 18 months after a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis. That was five years ago. It was important to me to be able to tell my children all of the different possible outcomes of my diagnosis, especially now while I am feeling so well and responding so well to treatment. I needed to have the lines of communication open constantly. For us, walking the fine line between maintaining honesty and creating worry is a daily decision. I think it is different for every family and you have to trust your instincts on what is best for you and your own children. I often ask my children what level of detail they need in order to feel confident in what is happening. For the most part, we have resumed a very normal daily life. Once my spinal fractures healed and I adjusted to chemo, my children have been very unaffected by my treatment. This is certainly the hardest aspect of all of this. Since I was only diagnosed five months ago, I am definitelystill navigating this myself. But I would be more than happy to touch base by phone if that would be at all helpful to you. I send nothing but good thoughts your way as you figure out what makes best sense for you. Here is a photo taken about two weeks after my first chemo. Proof that kids (and moms!) are incredibly resilient. ",
