Still going thru the shock and horror part, looking forward to the learning and living part:) anyway I\u2019ve searched and just couldn\u2019t find any relatable posts about fractures due to mets. Does anyone have any relatable stories? I had hip pain for months and finally last week had the \u201cright\u201d test show up mets to femur with impending fracture. I have surgery scheduled called proximal femur replacement. I\u2019m wondering how anybody else made out? Also per pet scan have multiple scattered spots all over, bones, lungs, liver. My onc hasn\u2019t met with us yet to discuss treatment plan because biopsy must be done first and can\u2019t start treatment anyway until I\u2019m healed from hip surgery.

We stopped chemo for about 2 months to try and figure out why I was so sick and all to have radiation for some bone mets to alleviate pain. So during a hospital stay I did have some ct scans that showed stable to slight increase in liver and lung Mets. Actually I felt pretty good about it since I hadn\u2019t been having any treatment. Anyway now I\u2019ve started doxil, I think you try to give it 3 months to work before you scan. Hope you all have a strong happy day",
