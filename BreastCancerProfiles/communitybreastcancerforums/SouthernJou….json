I'm not sure they even realize how many times they have called. It's all going to be OK. I'm still repeating to myself over and over this is nothing but it doesn't always work. The mind is so powerful you go into the what if''s and more often when your feeling the pressure of the multiple calls or missued words. No matter what happens tomorrow, everything will be OK. Now to just stay calm and try to sleep so tomorrow will come and go.",

So I'm good for 6 months and celebrated with a margarita and then sone wine when we got home today. Not having to worry about my own situation for a while will now allow me to concentrate in the ways I need to on my mother. She had her PET scan the other day and we're waiting on results. If all is well she will receive her implants the last of this month. She's 16 months into her journey with triple negative. I have to keep my focus on her and believe she will be healed.  To all the ladies who have not been so fortunate to receive good news, my heart and prayers are with you all.",
