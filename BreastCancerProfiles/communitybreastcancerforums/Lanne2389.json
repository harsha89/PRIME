Feels also like the edges are grating ( especially the tabs that stick out) digging in - worse on the bottom. These TEs are driving me mad. For those of you getting ready for radiation (I've had 9 sessions), work hard now on your range of motion - you'll need to get your arms up and back, pretty close to your ear. The mapping appt takes 20-30 minutes. OUCH if you're still straining like I was - which just adds to the stress of being in the CT machine. I resorted to oxy and Ativan to get through it. Your first rad appt will take 20-30 minutes too as they will likely take scans (which have to be examined by the Dr in btwn, all while you wait, frozen in position, on the table) before the actual radiation. And then you're back the next day - but thankfully getting in position takes longer than the radiation. My rads take about 70 slow breaths to complete. It's still hard even after 2 weeks. PT is v v helpful, especially for the massage.",

Very painful. I'm 13 months past surgery and the feeling has finally calmed down. I was on gabapentin (an alternative to Lyrica) and that worked well. Then I switched to Cymbalta (which addresses both anxiety and nerve pain). I added curcumin and that worked even better. I've had to stop the curcumin (Tumeric) bcs of upcoming surgery and I can feel the difference. If Lyrica doesn't work for you, gabapentin might. Don't settle until you have the pain under control ie to where it doesn't control you . It is so exhausting to deal with on a long term basis. Hope you find your solution soon! Lanne ",

The pain slowly lessened and at 13 months was almoooost gone. Then I opted for DIEP surgery instead of an exchange to implants. The scratchy feeling is back, but I'd say it put me back only a couple of months (but I'm still healing so could possibly get more feeling back). Anywho, just wanted to say the impact of the second surgery was so much BETTER than I feared. For those of you looking at a second procedure and worrying about the hypersensitivity I hope your outcome is as good or better than mine. Lanne",

I'm hoping that having smooth implants makes a difference - my TEs are slightly textured with 4 small tabs the PS uses to initially attach them to your chest. He told me that those stitches eventually dissolve and the TEs can move around a bit - eventually they are held in place by scar tissue. (These are TEs placed over the pecmuscle). Does that sound right (or wrong) to anyone?",

My problem now is that the skin on my chest feels like I've been in a wet bathing suit for 3 days if my shirt is touching it - not exactly pain per se but so unnervingly uncomfortable. Only feels better with 5mg oxyC, which I hate taking and the dr's office won't refill anyway. Tylenol is no help. Has anyone else had this problem? This, on top of continued pain/discomfort from the expanders themselves plus now radiation (and having to get my arm over my head AND my #%#% feet - gah), I'm at my wits end - my pain bank is depleted. Any advice or thoughts? Swap to implants is 7-10 months out. ps - I asked my PS ifwomen who have implants ever feel like they didn't- and he said not usually. :(",

I'm half way through and I'm just starting to see a little pink. FWIW - My radiologist recommends calendula cream 3x day (Boiron calendula first aid cream - not the gel or oil) because they think it penetrates to deeper skin layers than other creams or oils. I asked about Emu oil, and the nurse said they've found it is terrific for the top layers of skin but calendula goes deeper. But she said different centers recommend different things - they've just seen better results with calendula, especially during the two weeks after treatments end. I'm supposed to keep using the cream for at least 3 wks after rads are done. I'm going to try the green tea treatments tho - will slather on my cream afterwards. Re fatigue - Dr says the rads trigger your body to secrete something or other (didn't catch what) that triggers fatigue and they haven't yet figured out how to block it. She said I'd feel the effects until about Thanksgiving (my treatment ends second full wk of Sept.). I notice I'm more sleepy but it isn't like the chemo type of whole body fatigue. And just for comparison, I'm on my back for treatments (no mold) and the machine arcs around me including rads from beneath the table. The techs apply the bolus every other treatment. I'm being treated for one breast (after double m) and nodes. Each session lasts about 80 breaths! Wait 9 months afters rads to swap TEs (which i hate with a passion) for implants. Best to All.",

If you're close to your doctor and don't mind making another trip there the next day, this may be a less stressful option. My hospital even had a closer satellite office so it was even more convenient for me. The shot is likely the same outrageous price. I hated the patch! I accidentally knocked the patch with my bra strap and some of the medicine leaked out when it went off. Since we weren't sure how much was actually injected, I got a follow up shot - and did experience the flushed and puffy face described in the packet - likely got too much medicine. It abated the next day but was a bit scary . That's how I found out you can get a regular shot instead! Lanne",
