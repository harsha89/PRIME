There is a line, if you will, across the outside of my right breast going from the nipple area to the armpit, almost like there is a ligament pulling at the muscle of the areola. My GYN is sending me to a breast surgeon. Diagnostic mammogram and sonogram. She says she does not know if it is a ligament pulling or something going on further back closer to my armpit that is pulling the ligament. Anyone have any experience with this? It just seemed to show up one day. My doc seems concerned. Worried.ðŸ˜” Log in to post a reply",
