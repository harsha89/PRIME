I recently saw a naturopath (FABNO) who recommended a combination of locoregional hyperthermia, IV vitamin C, intermittent fasting, and various supplements for my residual disease. At the moment, it's not clear that I have any active disease at all, so I'm not sure how aggressively to utilize these expensive complementary approaches.",

I may have a tablespoon of coconut oil in the morning with my Tamoxifen so that I don't take it on an empty stomach. I also will have some bone broth and green tea during the day. Since I'm generally always hungry, a more strict fast is better than a 5-day fasting mimicking calorie restricted diet. And I swear I'm much more hungry since I started Tamoxifen last month.",

As you point out, Heidi, it's a cheap intervention that has shown some promise: https://news.usc.edu/103972/fasting-like-diet-turn... I'm aiming for 48 hours of fasting timed to coincide with my Herceptin & Perjeta treatments every 3 weeks. I tried 24 hours with my last treatment, and that went fine. I don't think I can fast for 17 hours every day, but every 3 weeks is feasible forme.",

Mostly, I'm thinking that I need to be reading this thread more often. There is so much collective knowledge here, wow. And so many knowledgeable individuals, too.

Z, thanks for the expanded perspective on biopsies, Foundation One, and Caris. I have had biopsies of liver, breast, and lymph nodes, and all seemed a bit tricky for the radiologist to get, due to small tumors, dense breasts, etc. It seems that I good biopsy sample is never a guarantee - so what's the solution, extra core samples every time, if that's even possible? Today is scan day, I had a head CT in the early morning, followed by breast/axillary MRI midmorning. The MRI was routine follow-up, but the head was scheduled quickly due to me having headaches and vertigo/dizziness for about 2 weeks now. I saw my PCP, and he couldn't find anything else to explain the vertigo, making me worried that it is a brain tumor. I never expected a brain tumor as my next crisis, so feeling unprepared. I expect to get results early next week, possibly Friday. A neurologist I know says if it's clearing up on its own then its probably not cancer causing the vertigo, so I spend all day second guessing whether it is getting better or staying the same.",

Thanks for the info about your consult at DF, Rhonda. I will keep reading this thread, I have a feeling that my liver mets are going to be acting up. I have a liver MRI coming up. This is a lot to process, isn't it? Does anyone here have experience with trials at NIH? There is one with TDM1 for patients post-brain surgery. There is so much going on right now, thanks for all the info about mushrooms, too.",

I got my CT results back yesterday, and it showed multiple tumors in my cerebellum, as well as swelling, which is of immediate concern. I was admitted to hospital and will have surgery on Monday. Hard to wrap my head around this, as I was not expecting it to go to my brain. Great-looking scans over the summer gave me a false sense of security. My family is researching clinical trials, but they haven't found anything yet. I will have to travel for a clinical trial, so I need to recover from surgery first. Then radiation. My mother has a connection at Dana-Farber, so we're looking into a consult there. Does anyone here have experience with getting a second opinion at Dana-Farber? Z, I'm going to get in touch with pathology about how they store samples, thanks to the wisdom of your experience. Not sure what further testing we will want. Okay, I guess I need to head over to the brain mets forum now. ",
