He mentioned that there was going to be a trail on a new drug for the treatment of lymphedema in Breat Cancer Patients. I do not remember the drug name. It is a drug that has been used for treatment in mets. patients. Researchers have noticed that mets. patients who happen to also have lymphedema had a reduction in lymphedema swelling while on this drug. Has anyone else heard of this? Does anyone know what the name of this drug is? Also..has anyone heard of this trail and how I can get more info.? \"I am not lost. I am exploring.

However, I just got a call this morning from the breast surgeon's head nurse...the MRI results are in. Good news - nothing in either breast - hurrah! however...the MRI showed questionable areas in my left lung. So now I am scheduled for a CAT scan of my lungs at noon today (I just was called by the nurse at 8:30am). No need to tell you, but I am scared to death! I just don't have anyone around right now to talk to. So I turned to you ladies (my support system)! Have any of you had an MRI done that showed up something in your lungs? Did the other test show that nothing was wrong? I know I am just grasping for positive stories right now.... I am dreading telling my kids (when they wake-up) that mommy has to go for another test today. ~ Barb (in Indy) \"I am not lost. I am exploring.
