I've been lurking a bit on this site and wasn't planning to post anything, but I figured I would since I've been experiencing a similar situation.  I'm also 27, and a few weeks ago at my physical my doctor found a lump in my left breast that she thought was different from the rest of my breast tissue.  I can feel it too-- it's about 1 cm and feels kind of flat and solid (and different from my surrounding tissue and right breast).  She sent me for an ultrasound which showed nothing, and the tech told me that it was \"probably just dense tissue\" but that I should follow up with my doc.   When I e-mailed my doctor about whether I should follow up, she wrote to say that she's going put in a referral for me to go to a breast clinic and ask them whether I should have more testing or just watch things.  I know from experience that these referrals usually take a few weeks to go through, but I think I'm okay with waiting because I'm grateful that my doctor is being proactive.   I spent a lot of time stressing during the week that I was waiting for my ultrasound!  I think that the worry has gradually gotten easier to deal with over time because I'm beginning to see that the likelihood of this being serious is small.  I've also been thinking that even if this is something serious, it seems that diagnoses tend to take a long time for many people, so I should just resign myself to the fact that this could take awhile and try not to let it eat at me too much in the meantime.   Anyway, just wanted to say hi since we're the same age and dealing with things that don't show on ultrasound.  I hope the waiting gets easier for you!  ",
