I just started Aridimex tonight.  Trying something a little bit different. Neo adjuvant hormonal therapy hoping to shrink some of what is in my left breast before surgery.  So -- reading all the posts on enzyme therapy and the potential side effects is a little scary but this whole disease is.  Tennis used to be my passion -- great sport.  I played the singles leagues in Washington Twp. But my hip started to be tricky so I gave it up for other kinds of exercise which are kinder to my body.  Wish I played now -- your Sunday group sounds great. ",

You bet. But I felt like I didn't want to compromise my joints when I know that there are other methods that can be used.  I will be calling my team  on Monday to have a discussion. I have read that the breast MRI is controversial because of the false positives.  I also know that my surgeon has done many without the MRI because of dense breasts which I have.  The powers that be really need to come up with something better than this machine. Probably not in my lifetime but wanted to weigh in. Would love to hear from others with with a similar dx  who couldn't do this test and how it turned out.",

And then she will prob. tell me I need a lumpectomy to take the \"thing\" out, and from what I have heard, that is where the staging comes in. I am older,way over 60 and am hoping that I will hear her say that in older women, this IDC is not aggressive.  I did post as much info as I could into my first post and that is pretty well all the info I have up to now.   Initially I was happy that the two \"masses\" which were called \"architectural distortions\" were tiny.

So at first I thought they were scar tissue.  Showed up on mammo and US as \"architectural distortions\"..  Left breast.  Of course this breast after biopsy done almost two weeks is itching and bruised still.   I have reflux on that side so now of course, with my imagination running wild, it is metastisis. The mind plays tricks after this dx. Some mornings I wake up feeling so positive and others there is that horrible feeling of negativity.  I see you are in the city -- great hospitals there. I am in NJ but Valley Hospital is a few mins. from my house so opted for that instead of going through the hassles of travelling to NYC. I will post results from whatever the breast surgeon says on Friday.  Let's stay in touch with each other and talk it through. We will get through this.  By the way, without having met with a doctor yet, how do you know yours is a Grade 2. They did not put any grade on my biopsy report.",

I am over 70 and thought twice about going for a mammo since my oncologists for the uterine cancer told me not to bother any more since breast cancer in older women is not that aggressive.  So I went and started the roller coaster ride. All of this being said (I am ranting here) my greatest fear is the spread of this thing. We don't know until the surgeon does what he or she has to do and then we wait again.I am prepared for my breast surgeon appt. Have notes, questions, and of course, my tape recorder. I have heard good things about the surgeon I am about to see.  By the way I do not take Xanax to calm myself but an old med called Donnatal which calms my stomach down. I have IBS. and it sure does help.  Also a shot of vodka here and now does the trick. I have gone over my path report with a fine toothcomb. I am ER and PR strong positive.  Have good Ki67 readings, but am waiting for HER2. If I knew for sure whether this \"thing\" is just confined to my breast only I would be a much happier camper. I also was on HRT for 20 odd years -- that probably did it a well as giving me uterine cancer. I also would love to find out if having no reproductive organs (had a complete hysterectomy five years ago) is a good thing at this time but haven't gotten any info on that either. I also am getting night sweats and am wondering if this has anything to do with the \"thing\". Prob. not but am changing to a pillow wih only cotton material.Now with every ache and pain I have in my body, I imagine the worst.  My other breast is now aching -- it probably ached before the diagnosis but never noticed. Now I am aware of every little twinge. Sorry for the rant but thought I would just put down on paper what I am feeling at this horrible time.  ",

Me being me am going over the path report with a fine toothcomb and attempting to find info that way. On the 8mm mass, the poorly to differentiated description doesn't sit well with me, having done some research.  This mass says \"8mm in greatest dimension and involving all of the submitted cores\" Confusing -- does this mean that the radiologist submitted the whole mass instead of a piece? \"all sumitted cores\" is throwing me a little bit and that's where I am confused. Also they say \"invasive carcinoma\" with no mention of what type of carcinoma. I am aware that there are different types of carcinoma. After having spoken to the radiologist office (head nurse), radiologist has the flu -- she told me that everything will be explained after the breast surgeon goes in there and actually sees what it is there. So this waiting in limbo is hell.  A shot of vodka sure does help. LOL. but I am one of those people who needs a little more explanation and since I don't meet with the breast surgeon until the 23rd, am left wondering and waiting, like 80% of the women on here. And...I also realize that regardless of the size of the masses, it's the lymph node involvement that really counts.   Again, thank you for any information that I can get.            ",

If it's a cancer center or a hospital, I think a call to the top brass there might bode you well with your current circumstances. I have to presume that this is closer to home for you rather than where it was suggested you go now.  I realize you felt comfortable with your doctor, but there has to be some compassion on her part under these current circumstances.  That's why I suggested calling the powers that be where you are being treated now.  I also realize that this is a very personal decision on you and your family's part so forgive me putting in my two cents.  I just sometimes feel that doctors are too quick to dismiss circumstances without going the extra mile.   Vent away on here -- we are listening.   Shirl",
