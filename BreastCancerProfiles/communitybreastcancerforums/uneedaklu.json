Reader's Digest condensed version: Nov 2017 - screening mammo; radiologist spotted some new small thing and did f/u US; conclusion was to watch and repeat in 6 months. BI-RADS 3; my OB's office never called me about this, which now makes me extraordinarily angry, but the breast health center sent a follow-up letter. 4/23/18 - repeat US; lesion is bigger and shows calcifications. BI-RADS 4A; f/u w breast surgeon for stereo biopsy. 5/3/18 - BS attempted stereo biopsy but couldn't visualize, so did US-guided instead. Pathology showed papillary lesion with atypical features and calcifications. BS recommended removal of remaining tumor, and is calling it lumpectomy, which is weird considering I don't have a diagnosis yet. 5/11/18 - insertion of Savi scout marker to guide excision (which I find infinitely preferable to having a coffee cup taped to my boob). So I'm scheduled for lumpectomy on Thursday 5/17. Also awaiting genetic info because I'm adopted and have no insight into familial history, but I provided raw data from my genome to the genetic counselor in the practice. Also told that because of the atypia, I now fall into the high risk category, so this is the beginning of a long road no matter where it leads. Waiting, waiting, waiting ... I'm already tired of waiting, and this is just the beginning. Eesh. Hope all of you ladies who went before me have the best possible outcome, whatever that means for you. ",

Watch and follow-up US in 6 months, which happened at the end of April. Lesion doubled in size, so off I go to stereotactic biopsy, except he can't visualize it, so he does US-guided instead. Pathology shows papilloma with atypia and microcalcifications. Because of that, I'm scheduled for lumpectomy which happened last Thursday, 5/17/18. I'm very happy to say that the pathology from the lumpectomy shows ADH, the same as the biopsy, so there's nothing hiding.

Phew. Still trying to process that this was the best possible result. I feel like this last month has moved me into PTSD territory. And I gotta be honest - I'm not 100% convinced that this is over yet. I feel like the idea of riding this roller coaster every 6 months for the next however many years might just put me over the edge. There's a part of me that wants to say \"Just take them away and be done with it\" to take back some level of control. Does anyone else ever feel like that?",

The surgeon was actually waiting for me when I got up to the unit from registration because apparently everyone else's surgeries went quickly, so it was the fastest pre-op prep I've ever had. I got to the hospital (about a half hour from home) at 11:30 and was home shortly after 4, which is awesome because without my morning caffeine, I was seriously cranky. So far, not a lot of pain as long as I don't move too much. My DH took me to my favorite place for an ice cream cone after dinner, and the bouncing in the car wasn't wonderful. I suspect that I still have a fair amount of lidocaine rolling around in there, thought, and I've had enough other surgeries to know that tomorrow will likely be somewhat unpleasant, but all in all, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I will say I'm a little surprised by the size of the incision. The initial papilloma was .9 cm x .7 cm, and the biopsy site was twice that, so I was kind of shocked to see that my incision runs counterclockwise from 12 noon all the way to 6 around the edge of my areola. When I raise my arm, I can really tell that the underside of my boob is mostly missing on that side. Like Kelligirl said, it looks like someone took a bite out of me. Hoping that pathology is back before my post-op follow up on Wednesday a.m. I'd like to just get on with it, whatever *it* is. Kelligirl and Ready, hope you're recovering well, and don't have too long to wait for your final results. Also, all of you other early May ladies, I hope everyone is on the path to better days. And for those of you still to go under the knife this month, you're all in my thoughts. ",
