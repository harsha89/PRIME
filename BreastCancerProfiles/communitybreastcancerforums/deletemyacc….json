I have TCH x 6 with Herceptin every week for four months, then I shift to only Herceptin every three weeks for the next eight months, for a full year of treatment.  I am considering a double mastectomy (preventative) in April with reconstruction.  I am terrified of TCH as I have been reading about horrible bone pain and mouth sores.  I am only 41 years old and in pretty decent shape.  I'm hoping for the best, but afraid this is going to ruin my life.  I live with my SO and his two wonderful sons and up until this I felt like i had everything I could ever want -- I was fully happy.  This is like a nightmare I can't escape and I'm terrified I'm going to age quickly!",

Maybe I should ask my onco Friday? I had a lumpectomy on 9/21.  They thought it was carcinoma in situ and once they got in the found it was infiltrative.  I had a sentinol lymph node dissection removal on 9/30 and they were all clear.  Right before the lymph surgery they told me I was positive for Her2neu and would need chemo.  I was crying so hard when they wheeled me in I couldn't breathe through my nose in the oxygen mask.  I am devastated buy rallying hard.  I love my life and my boys and I don't want to die anytime soon. ",

Thinking of you both today and hoping you feel better.   Seems many of us did the proactive thing and cut our hair early.  I had long hair for years, this is my first time in ten going short and I kind of like it! So that is a good thing.  I had my port put in yesterday and I don't mind saying I earned another WIMP Warrior status; cried and cried on the table in recovery and then had to take two Darvocet.  Back at work today mighty sore but powering through it.   Chemo TCH tomorrow at 11 AM.  I'm ready!! Baking my banana bread tonight and gonna make some new friends in the AM :) Joanne, your experience was especially helpful -- I can make it five bad days if I know it's going to lift by day six or seven.  Thanks for to everyone for lifting my spirits today.  We are so going to do this and come out better on the other side -- promise!!!!!  I 'borrowed' by brothers treadmill as I don't see myself going to the gym during hte next four months.  I plan on walking at least ten minutes a day on bad days, and 45 on the good ones.  Everything I've read says exercise is the key to beating off the fatigue, irony! Much love and strength to all you sister warriors.  I can't tell you the comfort I am getting from reading your stories.   ",

Anyway, my stomach is a mess.  My Dr. did not prescribe Emend for the first TX, but once I told him of my issues today (crippling constipation) he gave me a RX for next time.  Can anyone share with me (TMI I know but I need to  know) if hte Emend caused them to get constipated? BrendaShore: Congrats on the new Hip Hat Hair -- that is awesome! I bought two wigs but can't bring myself to have boyfriend shave my head yet.  I suppose I need to do it this weekend.  It will be one week out for me. Kimmy, hope so much by the time you get back on the board you are feeling better.  Getting sick blows, no pun intended. JustMeAlicia, I had headaches for hte first three days and then they pretty much passed.  Today one is back but I think it's from the Herceptin and/or the shot to make me grow white blood cells //grin . In any case, I'm loading up on Tylenol.  If it gets really bad I have some darvocet left over from the surgery at home.  Do you have any good pain meds or are you OTC? Mommy2Two, I hear you.  I seem to cry all the time lately, and feel as if I could cry now if I let myself. Peace and love to all of you today  Remember, this too shall pass.  Susie",

I'm happy to give you my experience if it will help -- maybe it will go so well it will ease your fears (mine too) I've been keeping it all together for my family and find myself crying at odd times (alone in car/stores/bathroom at work) I think because I'm trying to shield my family.  I'm sure this sounds familiar to many of us warriors -- I just got a new tee shirt Fight Like a Girl! On a positive note, I just made an appointment for the Look Good, Feel Better free makeover/class sponsored by the American Cancer Society. Thanks again Hopbird.

Popping in to say I am one TX down and it all went very very well.  My port made everything so easy and I'm so happy to report that three days after port surgery all my soreness and swelling is a thing of the past.  Got home last night and took Tylenol and a nausea pill and then an ambian to sleep.  Slept fine (YES!) and woke up to more Tylenol and nausea pill.  Side effect: horrible contsitpation? Any advice? I took some senokot last night with zero results //grin so much for worrying about being in the bathroom all night.  I also drank over a gallon of water while in treatment yesterday. So, is this day 1 or day 2? Not sure how you 'count' them, I assumed Treatment Day was Day 1 but maybe I'm wrong? Moving on the you guys on the board (enough about me already!) Ann you are not alone.  There are women all over this board who are here for you to listen and offer great advice -- I am so glad you found this place! Yesterday before treatment i was so prepared with a list of questions and comments due to THIS BOARD and these women who helped me -- Susie, a woman they have never met -- to be ready and prepared.  Educate yourself her and with books -- check out The Breast and Living Through Breast Cancer and you will make the right decision for you!!!  reglau I was mad as a wet hen about the port the first few days I had it in but yesterday was so grateful! i\"m on weekly IV therapy so it was a no brainer for me, but you might want to consider it.  Two people in treatment with me yesterday had vein issues, and it sounded scary.  My veins 'roll' so I\"m super glad not to be messing with that -- good luck in your treatment.  You sound very positive and I'm told that is half the battle.  ccnani Horray for Pink Heart Funds! As a Southern lady myself, I'm proud of my Mississippi sisters :) What a blessing for you! drcrisc: giving us the hope we need from the May thread  So awesome. Many thanks. SLV I am triple positive too -- are you having TCH chemo? I had two core biopsies, two MRI's, a lumpectomy, sentinole node removal, port placement and my first chemo on Friday, all in 75 days.  It's been a crazy fall for me! I have chemo for 16x, 6 weeks of recovery and then a bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction (my choice) plus a full year of Herceptin IV therapy.  Long road but I'm one TX down.  Would love to hear your thoughts on your Chemo experience.  I am hopeful on SE's but its early for me, Day 1 //grin so we'll see. RedheadPam; thanks for the heads up on the hair - I am a red head too (bottle!) and almost wish it would fall out right away so it can just be done.  I am about to jump in hte shower and go get ready to pick up my wigs -- very exciting! I don't know why (sterioids) I'm actually in a good mood today? Maybe it is the forward motion of having one of these dreaded chemo's down.  I'm pissed as hell about being 'sick' but ready to get on with my good life.  I was happy before CA and determined to be that way again -- today anyway :) Love to all of you, even those who I didn't get to -- we are all in this together and we can do it.  Stats for me; 41, Alpharetta/Atlanta GA, a fabulous SO i've been with for 4 years and two amazing stepsons, 13 and 16.  I love my life and want to keep living it! Peace until we 'talk' again.  Susie",

I am the same way about pain and medical stuff.  My SO will be there with me to hold my hand and I'll ask if I can have some of that cold spray and/or the Emla cream.  I am trying to learn all the names on here and am about to make myself a 'cheat sheet' //grin as I feel sure we will all be 'talking' over the next few months.  What a blessing to be able to reach out in this way. JustMeAlicia, I hope your shot goes well and that the ache isn't too bad Wednesday. I think I need to add Ativan to my list of ?'s for my oncologist.  Sounds like I also need to buy some Claritin.  You guys all have the most amazing attitudes.  Through it all I have tried to stay up for my family and friends, but some days it is a challenge.   SueinFL: I am sorry to read about your SE's but your attitude is amazing.  Life will go on for all of us and I so admire you getting up and walking it out.  I plan on sticking to my Yoga and Walking through chemo and hopefully that will help alleviate some bad SE's.  I am most upset about menopause, as I am only 41 but it is what it is.  It helps to read the posts here and know I am not alone. ",
