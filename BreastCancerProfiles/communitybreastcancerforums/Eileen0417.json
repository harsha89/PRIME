Have you experienced any hot flashes or other menopausal symptoms?  I agree, the longer we have high levels of estrogen, probably the higher the risk. Actually my estrogen remained at premenopausal levels all through chemo and tamoxifen. Which eas surprising to my docs. I'm glad that you felt at peace with your decision.",

With my first diagnosis I was 42 and premenopausal. My period stopped after my second AC treatment. After chemo ended, I started taking tamoxifen because bloodwork showed I was premenopausal. My period did not start up again but my onc said it was the tamoxifen that was stopping it. He did bloodwork a few more times and it continued to show premenopausal. I stopped taking tamoxifen last november and two months later my period started again. The first two were scary heavy and after that they were normal. Then I did not get a period last month and I started getting hot flashes. I was diagnosed with my second breast cancer a little over a month ago at 48. My onc suggested \"putting my ovaries to rest\". So I'm assuming that means the monthly shots and an AI. This was upsetting to hear as I hadn't had that missed period yet and was premenopausal. I was just starting to feel normal again: I was off all cancer meds and I had my period again. It was really nice to feel like I did before the whole cancer thing happened. Also I know that estrogen serves many functions in our bodies, protecting our hearts, keeping our arteries flexible, even stimulating the production of elastin and collagen in our skin-less wrinkles:) Hey it's something! My second hormone sensitive tumor formed while I was taking tamoxifen so I know that the hormone treatments don't guarantee anything anyway.  My oncotype results will be in this week and I just know he will be advising to suppress ovaries anf an AI.  I just hate the idea of stopping a natural bodily process. Even if I am starting menopause, I don't even like the idea of using an AI. Can anyone relate to my feelings?",

I am almost 7 years out from my first diagnosis and I am still seeing my medical and radiation oncs. I have never been sloughed off on a NP. I have been closely followed with annual MRIs also. I have just been diagnosed with a second breast cancer and my docs are all over it. If I were you I would make an apt. with him to discuss it and see if it is possible to continue seeing him. If not I would go else where. You have to do what makes you feel comfortable, but I never heard of such a thing.",

I have always seen my onc, and he examines me each visit and sits and talks with me and seems genuinely concerned not only with my physical health but with my emotional health and any concerns that I have. I just think it is wrong to push patients off on a NP, as someone said, you are paying to see a doctor. That is who you should get. This is cancer!",

I don't understand how insurance companies can override the opinion of doctors that are experts in oncology and work with patients every day. They are the ones who know!! I was diagnosed with my 1st tumor in 2006 and have had annual MRIs very year. My tissue is very dense and there are three other women in my family who had BC, no first degree relatives however my Mom's sister died of it. Fortunately my insurance has never questioned the MRIs. In fact, my second tumor was found in the same breast, a new primary on my MRI in september. It did not show up on my mammo last december and my doc did a mammo of that side the morning of my biopsy and it still did not show. And it was not felt on exam either. My surgeon said this is the exact reason that MRIs should be covered by insurance in high risk women. This latest cancer could have taken another couple years to be seen and would have been more advanced. It is to their benefit to pay for the tests because if the cancer is found earlier then they will most likely not have to pay for chemo etc... My surgeon said he has many patients who he thinks should have the scans and the ins. will not pay for it. My radiologist recommends the test every year and my medical oncologist writes the script. This tumor was 2.2cm which is not large but big enough that it should have been seen on a mammo. My med onc said that some tumors produce calcium and others do not and the makeup of it determines how well it can be seen. Perhaps you should have all of your docs sign off on the script for the ins. comany. My doc writes \"dense breasts, personal and family history of BC\" on the form. Good luck, keep fighting and hopefully you will get approval.",
