But my MO back then made reference to it possible helping against recurrence.

I am having a hard time giving up control of my kitchen but also know that I have to choose to do less as I know that radiation and/or chemo are looming. One thing that worries me is food as my guys are not at all creative and depend on me for most of cooking. Guess I got myself into that over all the years as it was my thing. My daughter plans to come home from travels mid October and she is a great vegetarian cook so that is something to look forward to. How do you manage with three hungry teenagers?

After the big surprises of my post op patholgy compared to my core biopsy pathology I did wonder what that was about. Since I am strongly estrogen positive, I was surprised about the aggessiveness of my cancer since this is usually a slower growing type. But the MO told me last week there is Luminal A and B and B is rarer and it seems this is what I have. Lucky me! I know that is why they are trying to get my chemo going ASAP, with the extensive lymphovascular invasion especially. While I was waiting for discharge after the port procedure on Friday, I read what was in my chart and see why my MO has added the mitigating circumstances to the notes for the chemo waitlist of having to have already waited 6 weeks for surgery. This was due to what she calls \"summer closures.\" Of course I was aware that the wait was due to surgeons all busy or away and OR's full but it is too bad that now it seems that we need to speed things up as a result. I did complain about the long wait for path but this is our system too. \"Hurry up and wait\" is what I am calling all this.  Marian ",

I just read your post and sounds like you could use some company, even through cyberspace. I have never been to Perth but hear it is beautiful. My husband is a Kiwi and we were supposed to go there in January or Feb. but not sure now with what may come following my surgery on Friday. You were diagnosed after me but had surgery pretty quickly it looks like. I have had to wati due to summer here and OR slates full and/or surgeons on holiday. But two more days and finally my surgery - SNB and lumpectomy as my surgeon tells me that due to the location of my lump and I guess my breast size, a mastectomy would be almost a radical. Anyway, enough about me; your situation sounds as though it has become even more complicated with the rheumatoid arthritis which I take it is the autoimmune disease that has caused the aolpecia. do they see that as permanent or hair will return on remission? As for chemo I have not gone there for myself as not sure if I will have it in addition to radiation I am guaranteed of. But I did look around on this site and there seems to be an excellent thread. I have a friend who lives in Thailand though she is American. She had a mastectomy and axillary dissection in July there and now is in the throes of deciding on what chemo and has two opinions. She already knew aboou this site but had not found the chemo thread and it has now helped with just more information. Her problem too is that their health insurance has a cap and if it were in a deveolped country that woud have been reached already so she is lucky that treatment in Thailand is relatively cheap. There are many woman on that thread already in chemo or starting and it seems that every thread has someone in the processs too. Is there an Australian thread? We have a Canadian one and also one for my province and though they are not perhaps huge in numbers, it is helpful to have people who are experiencing BC closer to home. I vaguely recall seeing an Australian/NZ one and will let you know if I run across it again.  Meanwhile you have three kids also on your own. Any family of any use? I know for me it is my friends and my kids but not extended family at all that are supportive. My husband too though he is away and not back until after my srugery on Friday though that is no problem as our 19 year old son has the day off and an old friend is taking me to the hosptial and picking me up after. Both our young adult sons live at home and our daughter comes and goes. How old are your kids? How have they taken this rapid course of events?   Did you have reconstruction after your bmx? How did it work that you had both done? So early in the game (well not early but no surgery yet) for me so not much knowledge of how it will go. Anyway, I am here and happy to hear any rants that you have - you well deserve them! Marian ",

OK, have to admit to copy/paste here but as you will see below, I aleady screwed up on losing long posts today! I wrote ealier this AM for the September thread ss there were 4 of us for surgery yesterday and one the day before. Hi Everyone: I have lost two posts so far today but may be due to not being all together \"with the program\" post op! I think I try to make sure there aren't any mistakes and then click something in the wrong place as in the last one when I did a preview first. So, I did have my lumpectomy, called partial mastecomy on my consent, along with the SNB yesterday. The nuclear med injection was almost painless and lasted only a couple of seconds; so much for my anxiety over it. The first IV attempt was much worse but thankfully the second one done by the anesthetist was better. My surgeon visited me before I left for home and she found a second small lump about 1 cm from the first and also a couple of the nodes she described as pearly looking; not a good sign I am thinking. It could take as long as 10 business days for my pathology reports but am so happy to have the surgery over with. I had a friend with me and she hung out after I got home until my sons got off work because I felt so awful. Her nurse daugher dropped by too and is coming over on Sunday to take off the first dressing. No showers for a week. It is great to have our young adults sons living at home right now - they both hung out with me for awhile and took good care of me last night. My husband comes home on Monday. Now that I am post op I look forward to sharing more of the DCI posts with you all and thanks so far for so much info. One thing I don't know anything about is the DCIS which was on my core biopsy result. Nothing to think about or waht? Marian ",

I have one ripe avacado left and plan to so something good with it. I was reading about juicers and recipes last night. This cookbook called Staying Alive, Cooking for Cancer Free Living was another pass me down from a friend survivor. More of this and that we should and shouldn't do though they try not to say DO NOT but rather think about it. Back to Juicers though, this book suggests it is one where better to pay more. Anyone care to weigh in on types? I got a really good pressure cooker for Christmas last year and paid more and got more than the cheap one I got at Canadian Tire - worth every penny and now that I am doing way more beans etc. from scratch it is so useful. As for smoothies, I honestly can say I have never had a vegetable one and it seems almost sacreligious to put my avacado in it but hey I am up for trying anything new on the food front if it tastes good. As for exercises, I went to my physio who I already love, for my first post op appt today and it was great. He knows all about LE and though he wants to refer me a to colleague who does LE massage in a few weeks for two sessions, he will handle all my physio for my right side (shoulder, arm, underarm, breast, the whole shooting match) and today gently went through the whole thing to check on muscles affected, nerves (all good on that front) and was totally reassuring. I see him every two weeks and feel so good about that. He has kept me trekking for the past two years and now we move onto a new phase. He and his family have a chicken coop and we going to visit them this weekend and check out theirs before my DH builds ours - can't wait to have our own eggs. And I don't want to hear that eggs are bad! Now back lying in bed as I am walking 5 k later this AM and am feeling tired - one week ago today was my surgery. Not bored yet but of course early days and still surrounded by books, notebooks, newspaper, cookbooks and breast books. Some of them put me to sleep thankfully. Tazzy back to wine, avacadoes, beer - I have been really good with dropping most alcohol and consider it a good day if I don't have my one glass of wine but honestly I feel OK about that one glass since I went from 2 or 3 more often on weekends. Habits. So I guess it is still a good day with the wine but I like it that I can also not drink at all on some days! Still not sleeping great since surgery but stopped any pain pills day before yesterday and finally at midnight took .5 mg Ativan - maybe not being as active as before has an effect too.  Marian    PS Went for the 5 km walk, never got the rest but had to deal with our Internet/Cable provider and that has taken an hour and now off to Yin yoga which my physio says is good; just nothng on elbows, wrists, arms but Yin is all about being mainly on the floor and holding stretches so am lloking forward to it. ",

I did have the CT scan (and bone scan which was fine) which showed a small spot (I saw 8mm on my chart when I was getting my port on Friday) but the MO seems to think it is not a problem and the plan is to scan again in 3 months. She said a PET scan would not be any more conclusive. My paranoia ebbs and flows! nbnotes I hope you did get some sleep after a crazy day with the news and also your first A/C! I too am curious as to how the process went for you - what made them suspect? And are they saying that the chemo should help this? Seems so crazy to be stage 1 wth no postive nodes to this. I know you will have been saying that too. For me it is so many questions but hard to get the answers with the busy cancer agency and leaving messages. ",

I did post a few days ago on \"Venting about permanent neuropathy\" thread which is unlikely what is happening to me~~at least I hope not! A few women also let me know that it would be doubtful. For me it is tingling/burning and pain in my hands along with pain either radiating to or from my scapula. I got Lymphedema for the first time in late April while flying. I had my compression sleeve on and was even on a lie flat bed in business class a (a big treat as I was using all my points. I had flown longer flights in January and March for NZ so was really surprised to see my hand like a balloon. Anyway, long story short I was on my way to Nepal to lead my swan song trek which I did do~~Mustang which is a high altitude trek. The lymphedema was there but did not bother me. On my return to Vancouver I already had 6 monthly appts. made and by that time I did have the tingling in my hands and the pain from my scapula but still not bad. However my implant redo only less than 6 months prior, was already contracting and cording starting, the reasons for the redo in December. My PS decided to remove all ASAP and scheduled that for June 26 whereas it took me well over a year to wait for the previous surgery. We were moving also in June and there was a fair bit of stress~~duh! But all the problems were getting worse and by the morning of surgery, I could hardly wait for anesthesia everything hurt so much. I had hoped that would resolve the issues but no and the past weeks have intensified the pain and my fingers and hand have tingling/burning and intense pain at times along with the pain from scapula and through my arm. I now have numbness in my under forearm where there is mild edema. The strength in my hand has decreased remarkably in the past 10 days. I had an ultrasound of axilla and supraclavicular area July 11 and unremarkable. I already had an MRI booked for same and since then my cancer agency has worked hard to decide what to do and luckily head of radiation was in on a weekend a couple of weeks ago when the MRI dept. was trying to decide on two MRI's. After lots of consolation the MRI July 31 is to be C-Spine and brachial plexus in hopes of finding out where the nerve damage is coming from. I also started Lyrica last Sat. 75 mg twice a day. I think it may be helping but am not jumping up and down about adding another drug. I have not been able to lie on my right side for a month as immediately the pins and needles start and arm to hand goes numb. Wish I was left handed too! Possibly the Lyrica, but I am sleeping better and not taking any Zolpadem which was I was taking most nights though a small amount~~2.5 mg. So that is my went for the day and am hoping one of you has similar circumstances. We are off to a folk festival today for the weekend so it should be fun and take my mind off this. Certainly it is a mystery. Now home from the folk festival and last night was mostly sleepless with the pain and sharp zaps through my arm and into my fingers. We spent a few hours at the festival today and I loved the music but felt like I was constantly nursing the whole works with more shooting jabs. 8 days to MRI and not looking forward to them. Lyrica was supposed to be assessed after a week (yesterday) but not sure if it was me or doctor to assess! I don't see a doctor until day after MRI. So that is my story for now.",

I went back over yesterday for an appt. at the pain and symptom clinic at the cancer agency. The doctor there asked if I wanted her to call Dr. Martin the radiologist to see if he could check on CT results. Long and short is that yes he could see a lump snd will do an ultrasound guided biopsy which is yet to be scheduled. Looks like less any chance of RIBP and more likely recurrence. Due to the pain, last week. I started on Oxycodone but yesterday it was changed to Oxyneo twice a day 10 mg snd it is helping. I have to say I am relieved that the team is working together to try to find an answer.",

So far I am being treated in Vancouver since everything is there for now. I have been referred by Dr. Elliot Weiss to Janet Sprague an RMT for measurements, wrapping etc. He also referrred me for an EMG at Holy Family and that date is in August but have heard nothing from RMT. BTW, Dr. Elliot at St. Paul's says the tingling/burning in my hand and fingers are not LE symptoms. Right now it is less the LE that is a concern as the tingling etc. have increased in such a big way along with huge lost of strength and that has happened only in the past 10 days so whatever is causing all this is moving fast. However, some of the issues are worse at different times so not continual for all~~tingling and burning in hand all the time but shooting electrical pains intermittent and pain to or from scapula is there but can really get bad.

Since I also had 6/8 nodes and other issues I have really struggled with whether to do rads before or after surgery. As usual there is no clear answer but the RO when I saw him in December, said that studies showed you could go either way but you have to decide yourself what you are comfortable with. i.e. if I fear the cancer recurring during the gap between chemo and surgery to rads after then maybe I will choose to do rads first. I found it all very difficult. I saw the PS Thursday and after a good discussion and examination and what can be offered to me, I made my decision to go with mx, axillary dissecton (this was already planned) done by my BS and then the PS will carry on with immediate reconstruction with T/E. He will do a fair fill right then so that after I am healed and go on to rads (ASAP after healing) there should still be some elasticity. So I felt good about the decision but I guess naturally a few days down the road I am having little niggling doubts. Crazy how BC can make us so fearful. But my MO will put me on Armidex right after chemo so there is a protection there. My breast surgeon also seems to think this plan is OK. My MO called yesterday and she wants to PS to do the surgery as soon as he can after chemo - like 3 weeks. She feels that my blood counts are good and clearly does not want any long gap. I guess it is time to look for a thread for surgery since my old September srugery thread is pretty much ended.",

I have been reading your posts and last ones about Effexor (Venlafaxine it is called in Canada) I would suggest that it is individual. Awhile after I had been on it I brought up wit my doctor at our cancer agency my concerns with the scary withdrawal stories. She said it is actually not as common times comes, we do it with care. Just suggesting that sometimes inadvertently we scare those (like me at one time) who may need whatever the drug is. I did not mean to post on Effexor LOL! Short story is I am awaiting results from core biopsy yesterday and hope to have them Monday or Tuesday. Lymphedema late April and I had been on a flight though had my sleeve on and never before even on longer flights. I think it was kind of a red herring but luckily I had my usual 6 monthly appts. lined up when I returned from my swan song trek I led in Nepal in May. Physio, RMT, MO, PS and told them all about my LE and also that by then I had some tingling and burning in BC hand. PS agreed that the redo of recon in Dec./16 had not worked so set up surgery ASAP and implants removed June 26. MO was concerned and tests ordered. Since then pain from scapula through axilla and down arm to hands much worse and a month ago hand strength suddenly diminished and right under forearm swollen and numb blah blah. MRI July 31 showed enhancing tissue, Chest CT with contrast Aug. 2 showed lump and core biopsy yesterday showed lump 2.5 cm long and rectangular. Head of of rads at my cancer agency who has been involved for several weeks thinks probable axillary recurrence. My original lump was close to axilla, 6/8 nodes taken during lumpectomy positive and 1 more positive post chemo at mastectomy and axillary dissection. Extensive lymphovascular invasion and am i surprised now? No, but weekend waiting game. Not liking prognosis I am reading about either but it is what it is. Thanks for the venting time.! Marian",

My did not develop until a year ago last fall and so about 8 0r 9 months post exchange. I have never liked my Allergen 410 hard and cold implant so nothing to do to with PT suggesting it. He thought it was worthwhile asking the PS as it does appear to extend under the implant and muscle. Calidancer, my PT and I hoped that the work he was doing plus stretching would cause that release or pop but no. What PT does do though is break it down and keep it from increasing in size which did happen last winter when I was away 10 weeks. jill, so glad to hear that your LE therapist has been able to work on arm/truncal~~how far into the trunk and arm? Sounds like you really have had what I call \"cancer takeaways\" far beyond your dx and surgeries? Katydids, yes when was your surgery as it can take time as jill says to figure out what will disappear with the healing process and what will slowly resolve or become perhaps an issue. BTW, my PT keeps me going in many ways~~before BC, he kept me trekking which is what I kind of do for a hobby~~leads treks in the Himalaya and I had motorcycle injuries from decades ago that eventually gave me some grief just pre BC. I am thankful that not only is he awesome but he is young enough that he can keep me going for a long time! I am also lucky to have insurance that pays for much of it as Canadian insurance does not pay for physio unless you are poor or have extended insurance. Unrelated, yesterday I had an abdominal CT scan with contrast (nothing to do with BC) and that was less than thrilling as they can't use the right Mx side and difficult to get it in the used up veins on the left. Finally called the IV team and I got the scan.",

As for my baldness, for some reaon it hasn't bothered me much. I go to yoga several times a week and off comes my cap or scarf and I feel just fine and everyone else seems fine with it too. At home I never wear anything on my head - I have never liked hats or caps too. In the car I often get hot and again off comes scarf or cap. We are all so different and wonderfully so. adagio, saw the MO today and good to go tomorrow for #4 A/C. Neutrophils were such that I go back to 5 injections every other day. So it was, 7, then 5, then 6 and this next cycle 5 again. I asked about hemoglobin today. Even though I am still keeping up with my walking etc. I wondered if my feeling that I have had to back off a bit on uphills etc. was heart or oxygenation, thinking more about the latter. Sure enough my Hg has been sliding and MO says chemo. Diet is good and chemo is culprit. It was 92 today and if it goes below 80, then blood transfusion. This triggered lots of emotion (though really transfusion if necessary is fine with me) as my father in 1994 had lung cancer and both first and second chemos had to have blood transfusions. Second one, minutes after, he went into respiratory arrest and died 4 days later. So yeah lots of thoughts today even though our situations and health are very different. 8 weeks for him from diagnosis to death. As for which chemo thread for newcomers, I confess to reading all the fall ones as there is so much to be learned from everyone!",

Don't worry about the hair thing; I think you will manage it fine. I was at the Look Good Feel Better class today and they said it is rare for permanent hair loss (alopecia) but that it does take a long time post chemo for really good hair to grow back. Class was great so hope you sign up soon! We cut my hair Tuesday night at home - #2 buzz but even that fuzz is coming off now. I went to yoga late afternoon and even took off my cap as I was hot and honestly did not care. I do wish though that I had kept my curly Mohawak longer than an hour as it could have been fun with trick or treaters last night! You may have already figured out the Neupogen and FairPharmacare but Neulasta is not covered here and is same anyway as Neupogen just more hassle as you have to do the subcuatenous injections on your own instead of a one shot deal each cycle. Victory Program will likely pay almost all if not all of your costs. Also my MO asked me to try the first cycle not using Claritin and I had an easy time. She said it was better to try a cycle so I would have a baseline. So far I am happy with all her advice and hope Karen is same for you. I do do it every other day from second day and have heard that daily times 7 may be rougher but not sure. I only have to do 5 next cycle as neutrophils good. It is great to have Sept., Oct., and now Nov. threads as much info from those before, those during and those to come! Thanks all!  Chemo # 2 A/C has been quite OK so far. Marian",

Not that we are exactly making records here but don't want to get an infection or worse!

You may recall on my last post I said the GP at drop in (last Wed. evening) said I had folliculitis of the labia majora and mucisitis of the genitals. Even the cancer agency help-line nurse the next day had a laugh with me about that dx. The lumps look like the little bumps on lego. No sex around our house and probably be awhile with lego parts! As for dose dense Sneaky refers to, as always with our cancer, treatments are situational. In my case, dose dense was recommended if I could do the Neupogen cost. Turns out we don't pay all that much and same for most of us in British Columbia. But not much is a lot for many families and so the majority do not have dose dense. For sure there is less concern about the blood counts as below. But with my fast growing and aggressive cancer faster is better in my estimation. Yesterday we discussed the Taxol dose dense or once every 12 week options. Dose dense still recommended but if I don't tolerate it then we go to the other option. I was away from posting for awhile. Vancouver General Hospital does not have WiFi!  Long story short, I am grateful for the follow up from the help line at BCCA and when my blood work results came back from the pre chemo draw Friday AM, the doctor who read the results called and suggested I go to ER at VGH and when I arrived the paperwork was already in progress. My hemoglobin was 82 and neutrophils .4 so with anemia and neutropenia, I was admitted within minutes. I was there from Friday afternoon until Monday AM and along with lots of IV antibiotics and 2 units of red blood cells my counts all recovered. I got a pass from the hospital yesterday to go to my scheduled appt. with my MO. She cancelled my chemo for today saying no oncologist would allow chemo after what I had been through and I need a week to recover. So now it is next Tuesday which puts me \"behind\" a week but means no chemo on Christmas Eve! I posted today on my blog about my hospital stay and also posted a photos of my amazing view. Last night I watched \"Parenthood\" for the first time. I had heard a main character Kristina, has breast cancer and is on chemo. She too got hopsitalized for neutropenia but on Christmas Eve and way more drama but I had a much better room with a deluxe view! Photo of view is in today's blog post.  XXOO Marian",

I will have to go back for port flushing after 4 weeks but Dr. Lennox plans to take it out during surgery which saves one more procedure.

For several days after the little hairs fell out en masse in the shower.

One more of A/C next week then Taxol starts. As for chance of infection, I went to 3 evening events last week but only once did I feel I was too close to too many people and we left. I am on dose dense so every two weeks with Neupogen every other day (this cycle 6 times) and seem to feel the worst at the halfway mark - like now, but felt pretty OK for several days after chemo and then seem to feel much better last 4 days before next chemo so am looking foward to the weekend! So it may be around the halfway mark that we have the lowest wbc and chance of infection is what I am thinking. Have still not done the wig even though it is mostly covered on our insurance - but I don't work and so not sure if I really need/want one. My only advice is not to order too much stuff as I did - I know I won't wear most of it.  Flu shots - at chemoteach we were told they would tell us when to get it and I keep forgetting to ask at chemo when this might be!

I know about the second guessing too and many times in the past month have wondered about bmx vs umx but I do not have the same scenario as you and I have read/heard the same about LCIS with more chance of recurrence. For me there were many things that came from pathology from my lumpectomy and SNB including of course the 6/8 but I also have cancer on one margin and really close to others plus the extensive lymphovascular invasion. I don't think I am in the same category as you re bmx but the ALND has given me cause for relfection but I am trusting in my BS and MO who say it is important and no doubt there will be other nodes though I suppose chemo will have done a number too. I read on another thread that some of the newer research is against full dissections, but you know what? I allowed it to bother me for a day or two but then again realized I need to trust my medical team and do whatever I can to keep recurrence at bay. My adjuvantonline numbers for recurrence are high but do drop significantly with chemo, surgery and rads too. So much for each of us to take in and move on with! Marian",

Nothing like Alberta but I am glad to be sitting in our warm house looking out at the sunny cold day. I can relate to those of you with the problematic blood draws. I had my exchange surgery yesterday and the nurse did not even try to get the IV in. Anesthesiologist did it in the OR and used my only little vein where I have managed to get my blood draws. When I woke up the IV was on the inside of my arm and there was another \"try\" on my hand so he had to redo the IV a couple more times and now I fear that little vein that Lifelabs has been able to use will now be useless too. As for the surgery, it went well and the nurses were very complimentary on how good my newly constructed breasts look. I was in and out of the hospital in a few hours and slept well last night.

Shelley, it is good to hear that things turned out so much better second time around. Tuesday was my mx etc. and now Sunday. Though I came home Thursday feeling not bad, Friday was no fun at all. I took my very first Anastrozole at 0700 with my antibiotic and 2 plain Tylenol. I started feeling naueated soon after and then vomiting. Took me awhile to figure out that is was likely the AI. I read the S/E pages and sure enough first one was nausea when starting the drug. But it did last all day and evening and I guess, went backwards as nausea/vomiting had been an issue post op. Yesterday I took Gravol first thing and took some advice on the Anastrozole (BCO members and cancer agency pharmacist and took it in the evening along with some more Gravol. Yesterday was so much better and I even managed a slow walk of about 3 k. Pain management still OK too and home care nurse coming again today. She changed my dressing Friday and incision looked good. Not much drainage now and maybe drains out on Tuesday. For those of you with bmx I can see where the recliner would be great unless you have someone to help you in and out of bed all the time.

My surgery went well but I did have nausea and vomiting in recovery and so was there a few hours. It was not bad though as they kept me topped up with antiemetics and pain meds IV. Low blood pressure and Hg dropped too so I got the choice to stay an extra night and was quite happy to do so. I have seen my new breast (not much fill in yet) and it looks good to me. Nipple sparing was not an option as BS said with cancer on and close to margins, not a good idea. Pain is not bad but I agree with staying on top of it. The resident gave me an Rx for Emtec or Traumatab/acetominophen but I told him I wanted Percoset~~a breast cancer buddy who had same surgery and PS in the fall said she needed more than she got sent home with and PS ended up prescribing Percoset for her which I told the resident. He kind of grudgingly gave me what I wanted so am asssured of good pain relief now at home though I do hope to taper off sooner than later.  I am really lucky in that a friend flew out from Nova Scotia last night to spend 5 days looking after me which makes my DH happy. She and I nursed together in the same hospital I had my surgery in and though it was decades ago, we knew a few people still. Neither of us has seen a drain in years though so we learned that today before my discharge. Home care nurse will come too to change the dressings and also will take the drains out when it is time. PS also took my port out and so they could not use it for the IV. That was maybe the worst part as my veins are so bad. The nurse gave up and the anesthetist actually gave me gas to knock me out so he could put the IV in pain free! No fun down the road for regular blood work but the doctors did not want to leave it in just for that. So as others have said above, it is not as bad as I thought~~quite manageable in fact. And it feels so good to get this step on the long journey over with. Marian",

So next Wed. another fill and CT simulation delayed again. But I just hope this resuturing does the trick. Thankful, I hear what you are saying about bmx's but for me, I was happy to keep one breast. If I have to have it removed down the road so be it but for now I have one with feeling in it. However I suppose that may change a bit when my PS does an augmentation way down the road to \"match\" my foob. Meanwhile, good luck with your excision!",

I have used a pillow under my legs for years and it works fine. She also said not to worry about buying bras etc. as each doctor has their own protocol for dressings and recommendations after surgery.

It does not make sense since you also say Stage II and to have mets means breast cancer elsewhere than breast/nodes/lympho/vascular system and thus that would be Stage IV. Even though I had a one node that was thought in surgery to be a second lump, it turned out to be what was called a metasteses of a lymph node but still not a \"met\" i.e. in a \"distant place.\" I hope that makes sense and that you do not have mets!

He also said that normally he would not be doing fills as fast but because I am having rads soon (RO would have liked it even sooner) he had to fill quickly.

I suspect she thought I was OK and then no MO for two months due to surgery etc. When I finally did speak up, albeit in tears, I was persuaded by her to try Mirtazapine with a low dosage and have now taken them just over 3 weeks. Can't say that it is what is working but I am better. My wise daughter just emailed with advice from a roommate saying \"... says drugs are not the solution, but they make it possible to see solutions, to make the necessary changes in actions or thoughts. So I support your courage to take them.\" I am not speaking publically about this so only my family really knows. Yesterday I realized I had taken mine out the night before, went to get water and forgot to take them. I felt really weird mid afternoon and suspect that was the cause. I do not intend to make this antidepressant thing long term but if it helps then yes I am doing myself a favour. I was really miserable and though I was still out walking and did not stay in bed all day, I was very low.

Maureen, you are amazing and have managed so well to keep track of us all, enocurage us and be there for each of us. I had my surgery 4 weeks ago tomorrow and ROM is much better every day and I am doing the exercises recommended in pamphlets given to us post op. I also see my PT weekly and he is happy with my progress. It still has a ways to go but I see the light at the end of the tunnel and know I need to persevere. I am back walking 5 k almost every day. The one thing that seems to be variable is the compression sleeve. How many of you had one prescribed? My BS when I had my first visit with her last Tuesday, said I should wear it every day all day for 3 months. My PT and also the woman at the pharmacy who fitted me for it disagree. The woman suggested wearing it for a short time each day to get used to it in case of L/E starting. So I am wearing it now for my walks and my PT will closely watch for any signs of L/E weekly. I can tell by my rings on both hands that when I walk there is some tightening but because it is equal both sides, it appears to be normal. I had lunch on Sat. with 3 other BCO women and L/E was a topic. One other woman had her sleeve on along with a guuantlet or glove and she and one other said I too should wear one. I have to say that this whole topic is a tough one. I have gone to the BCO site but still it is not easy to make decisions. I think my BS is being careful but for me too careful. Any opinions out there? I had some slight oozing from my incision the past few days but I think it is OK. I go for my 3rd fill of 60 cc tomorrow and that should be it. Radiation CT simulation is now set for April 15 with rads to start a week later. I am happy with that as it was supposed to have been this past Wed. but thankfully PS wanted to do another fill. I feel as though now there is enough time in between. My MO took me off Anastrozle which I had started March 8 as I have been having S/E and feeling very low. She seems to think it will be fine until after rads. Oh, the roller coaster of this BC!",

My first and last jobs were pre and post natal and I loved it. Now feeling very lucky to be retired and am in awe of you who work so soon after treatment.",

Dr. Dingee even told me that it could take forever the day of my surgery. I did not cry but I did get mad and I think the staff at MSJH was relieved when it finally came through, not to mention everyone around me. Hurry up and wait became my motto. 3 weeks +/- a few days seems the crazy norm and BS said in US only a few days. But we can take heart in the fact that theirs is an insurance issue and patholgists there get paid a bundle to do it. Does not make it easier to wait but I bet Hazel keeps you from going completely crazy.",

I know you already have a great medical team and once you go to BCCA, you will find them wonderful too. Sounds crazy, but everyone there is so caring. I had a PET scan there too and I fell asleep in a big recliner while the sugar contrast was absorbed. They even give you a choice of music and headphones. The scan itself seemed quite fast and the tech so nice too. So much to absorb for you but it sounds like you have a great partner and baby Hazel and I am thinking good friends and family too who will pitch in?  I am still to have the full axillary dissection but with already 6/8 they are sure there are more. One day at a time is how I have done a lot so far and lots more for you and me and so many of our other sisters here who are with us, thankfully!",

Osteoporosis and fractures are a couple. I am having a bone density test next week for a baseline so you might want to ask about that. Hot flashes too for some. Yay, more of them. Taxol has been giving me night sweats so I am already getting used to that. Radiation after surgery for me but I think it is totally individual. ",

Just got home from physio, counselling appt. at BCCA and yoga. Great morning! My physio has me booked weekly pretty much continously after my March surgery and is also referring me to a massage therapist who specializes in L/E and lympahtic drainage and of course massage for after surgery also so I think I am going to be in good hands. It is good to have a plan. My first counselling hour long session which I asked for only on Monday when at the cancer agency for bllod work etc. was excellent. I noted that others on the threads have chosen counselling and for me it was good just to have the chance to speak to a professional. I will see her monthly. So now off for a walk with my neighbour. Steroids are good for something!",

I have called this a roller coaster ride all along because I can feel so positive one minute and then whoa, how did I get so sad? Hazel must be so beautiful at almost 6 months old and her love for you will just grow and grow and without reservation. She won't care about your \"new body.\" I know that is not concretely helpful but let yourself have those down times and appreciate the up times. Who will give you the path results, BS or PS?  Marian",
