I did one round of chemo last November, which I had a highly allergic reaction to, was bed ridden for nearly three weeks and never did it again.  I then completed my radiation from DEC through Feb, while receiving herceptin treatments every three weeks until April when I got a bad muga score 43.1 and had to stop herceptin for a time.  I decided to go with my spirit/gut and get a second opinion as the cancer treatment center in my area has a terrible reputation and I was pretty unhappy with my treatment thus far.  The new center's oncologist was appalled that my ovaries were not taken out (I'm HER2 positive) and they are being removed (oohphrectomy) on Tuesday.  He then \"revisited\" the chemo issue saying that the herceptin will NOT work unless it is given in conjunction with a chemo drug.  He said the chemo that I was given was antiquated and that his team would not be using it; he also said he would give me a much lower dose and more steroids in the beginning.  I told him I would give him a chance.  I also had a dream the night before my scheduled appointment; in the dream, the cancer metastasized to my lungs...when he was speaking to me in the office...he said we need to do the chemo as we don't want to have it metastasize to places like your lungs!  OK OK I'm doing chemo again:/  ...and my hair just grew back a couple of inches:/  sighs",
