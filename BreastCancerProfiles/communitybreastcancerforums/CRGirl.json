      "Content": "CRGirl wrote: I tried talking to a coworker the other day about questions for my bs appointment that I had today. She is a breast cancer survivor so expected some level of understanding and good practical suggestions. I have been extremely stressed about an inconclusive biopsy and been doing 6 month follow ups. My biopsy came back with a number of possibilities. They never said benign. The repeated tests and the roller coaster ride each time you have tests is not something I can handle. I like things black and white, I like a clear plan, and I like knowing all the facts. My coworker basically told me i was being stupid worrying, and that I was going to give myself cancer and why was I thinking the worst. I said I wasn't gloom and doom and thinking I was dying. In fact if it is cancer I believe I would win. I just need to know for sure, rather than having all these questions. Anyway, my daughter and i met with the surgeon and he was fabulous. He didn't jump on the surgery bandwagon. We talked about another biopsy, but figured it was likely that would be inconclusive again. Asked about MRI but said it wouldn't likely show anything more than we know already. We reviewed my results, and he confidently said you don't need to worry about these three, but \"this one can be nasty\". I told him I think I want it out, he said given the differential diagnosis I received that would be his choice too. I feel I made the right choice pushing to see a specialist. I wanted peace of mind, and now I can get this damn thing out and know for sure what it is. Then it will be treatment if this is indeed a sarcoma, or finally back to regular mammogram screening. Good news is it will only be a three to six week wait for the procedure. Though I don't have a diagnosis yet, I feel this is forward momentum and that a huge weight has been lifted. I have a plan now and will deal with what that brings. Still hoping for good news ( and the odds are in my favour) and am waiting again, but I least this time I will get real answers.

I don't think asking for a conclusive answer is unreasonable, but it still makes me feel like a pushy patient.",

You don't want to worry them, but trust me if you don't you will cause yourself more stress. I played down my fears at home, then had a meltdown at work. I finally ended up talking about the whole situation rather than just \"oh, I have a test\", now I am able to sleep a bit better and am way less stressed at work. I didn't go so far as to ask him to go with me to the surgeon, but my daughter asked to come with me. She already believes I know more than I am telling her, so this way I can prove I am not hiding things from her. That should help her stress level. She worries about losing me since he dad died in an accident when she was an infant. So, 5 days to go and I can maybe have some better answers for all of us. Take care, and good luck!",

      "Content": "CRGirl wrote: A year ago I had a mammogram and ultrasound that showed a 10 mm lump close to the chest wall. I didn't waste any time and asked for a biopsy. The core needle biopsy slides were looked at by two labs but came back inconclusive. i cant recall what they said, but basically it could be one of three things, one was nothing to worry about, the other could hide cancer and the third could potentially show later as cancer. I had a follow up ultra sound that didn't show any changes. I am due for another mammogram next week, and expect another ultra sound since I have dense breasts, but am wondering if I should push to have the lump removed? Where the lump is they can't really see it fully on mammogram or ultrasound. The breast feels different than two months ago, and the \"what if factor\" is driving me crazy. They say don't worry, but I do. What if they are wrong and I have had a reason to worry all along? Log in to post a reply",

I have been waiting patiently and now I am two days away the mammo, and those wonderful squished extra views for the area to be magnified. Then another ultra sound on the same day thank goodness. Once these come through showing things still the same ( hopefully) or worse ( hopefully not), I will be sent to see the breast surgeon/ oncologist. Lucky for me I have a great doctor who understood my not being comfortable with previous inconclusive results. Dr says the breast surgeon will either give me peace of mind with a biopsy that comes back conclusive and/or be the one to remove my lump. Also I am hoping he can help me uderstand my dense breasts and what that means for my risks. Don't know how long it will be to get in to see the surgeon, but at least it is forward progress. Hopefully this will put an end to the worry over the \" we think it might be a possible fibroadenoma, or phylodes tumor, or hamartoma, with atypical hyperplasia. Results inconclusive.\" I can't wait to get off this roller coaster, or if need be get on with the real deal, rather than this fear of the unknown. I can't battle an unidentified foe, but if it is cancer I can get down to the serious business of getting it out of my body. I have to admit though that even hearing the word oncologist is enough to cause you mind to blank and your heart to race at the same time. In any case better to err on the side of caution. Fingers crossed for good results and a speedy process.",

I actually had a mental/emotional meltdown today at work since this stress and worry is driving me nuts. What does that say about my ability to handle a cancer diagnosis if I were to get one? I know I need to take a deep breath and relax but it is more easily said then done. Hopefully I can get some sleep tonight (that would certainly help!) and get through tomorrow, then put this out of my mind until the next round. Fingers crossed! Jillianmommyof3 - I hope the next month flies by for you and you get good results. I can't image your challenges with 3 kids and this hanging over your head. I only have one daughter and she is 25 and I think I am almost as afraid for her as I am for myself. Thanks for your support and empathy. It means a lot.",
