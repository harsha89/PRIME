Patricia ~ hey feisty lady!  Tuffy looks great!  I'll have to post a picture of Fiona.  I took some pics of my 87-yr old dad modelling Fiona when I was in Toronto last weekend.  Then my brother tried it on - laughter therapy at it's finest!  Yes, Carlisle is just up the road.  I wanted to tell you I ordered Kanta's CD.  I've been looking around for another one to get, and I downloaded Louise Hay's on cancer.  I needed some good meditation cd's - so thanks for the suggestion.  For anyone who wants a hilarious movie to watch, Bill Cosby \"Himself\" is laugh out loud funny!  My friend picked up a copy for me at Barnes & Noble and I howled laughing.  You know what they say, laughter is the best medicine.  Have a great weekend May Warrior friends!",

I'm not planning on testing the pH of my urine but am intrigued by what I've read on one of the threads on BCO.  Some have lost weight and have gotten lots of energy from alkaline diet, etc.   I might order a case of Alka Pure water from Amazon to see if I notice a difference.  It's too bad the filtration systems are so expensive.   ",

Wellsey ~ hope you meet your man!  Congrats on 40 yrs!!!!  Re: rapidlash - I've known women who swear by it.  Same with Latisse.  Never hurts to try.  Have a fabulous weekend in NC! GG ~ hope you can make it to our get-together.  Glad to hear no skin problems with rads.  Also, good news about the weight loss.  I've put on over 20 :-(     Congrats on BF's dream job - at least the living situation is temporary.  Hoping and praying the last of your rads will be an easy ride with minimal, if any, SE.  How's the fatigue? Paxton ~ I hear the relief and excitement in your voice!!!  SOOOOO happy for you!!!!!  Yippee!  Hurray for being done!   Leanna ~ sorry you had to go alone.  I'm telling you, I would have taken off yesterday to come with you!!!  I think my friends think I have so much support and I'm experiencing the same thing.  It is a long road.  Everyone has full plates of their own and they just don't know.  Good for you - checked your Komen site - hope you make more than your goal.  Okay, I know what your SE are like.  I'll be praying for you daily!  It's a promise - esp. since I couldn't come to tx with you.  Hopefully they won't be as severe.  Hugs and prayers your way....  You can do this! Sacphotomom ~ you will start to decline....but only to incline again.  We're on a healing journey...lots of downs, but ups as well.  I, too, love rubbing my head.  Will think about you next time I rub it - and will send positive vibes and prayers your way while I do. Jean ~ when do you get the results from your scans?  Hoping for the best.   DancerMel ~ who would have ever thought that would be an obsessio?  Hope it comes in full, healthy, beautiful!    Keep smiling! Summer ~ where are you?????  everything ok?   I'm SOOOO glad my final tx is tomorrow and even more excited that Fri. will be my last Neulasta shot!!!  My onc. is going to be disappointed that I still haven't followed thru with BRACA testing.  I still don't know about the oopherectomy either.  DH and I are trying to decide if we should plan a trip before or after rads.  I'm afraid I might be too wiped after, so we might go to Cabo San Lucas or somewhere tropical in October to celebrate 20 wonderful yrs together.  It would only be 5 or 6 days - so it may even be somewhere closer.  We need some down time together.  Not to mention, some romantic time - since it's not been on my radar the last few mos.  Some things are worth investing in, or re-investing in - which is more my case.   I'm so grateful to have you guys to share the ups and downs of this journey.  Thanks to each of you for your honesty, encouragement, inspirations, and humor.  I'm glad we're sticking together thru rads!  hugs, Daiva",

Jersey ~ you're not the only one feeling down.  Vinny sounds like my DH - balanced and rational and steady.  Re: tamox -  I called my onc. yesterday to see if I can skip filling the rx. til after ooph in Jan. because they'll swith meds then anyway.  He was ok with it - thank God!   I don't want to take any of it!!!!   I cracked up when I read your rx was in your glove compartment.   kim ~ hope the cold's better.  Thanks for the hugs.   Patricia ~ 5 ft. snake!   I would have run right out of my house!!!  You mentioned your hair color - are you going to keep the color or do something about it?  I can't wait to start playing around with color again - but don't really have enough yet. So I went back to Hopkins to see my PS yesterday.   He has never seen a punctured TE.  Aren't I special!?   I got another 100cc fill and will go back in 2 wks for another.  I woke up this morning and it appears to be leaking internally because it's already deflating some.  Argh!!!!!  He doesn't want to wait 6 mos for my DIEP anymore and wants to do it 3 mos earlier.  It's now scheduled for 3/8.  That's really around the corner.  My ooph and port removal will be mid Jan.   At least my boobs matched in size for a day.  My left boob looks a bit weird due to the fact that it's rotated.  I was so sad to find out the nurse practitioner who does my fills and works with the PS is moving away.  It's amazing how attached you can get with some of your care providers.  We have really bonded and I'm so bummed - esp. with the big surgery coming up in March.  Life just goes on... Ok, last thing...  Luke is in 4th grade and is asking me to help him come up with metaphors (homework).   Nothing like jogging the brain first thing in the morning! ",

I don't know if I mentioned this before, but Emma's friend (19) was pregnant at the same time I was having chemo.  We spent a lot of time together.  There was no way she could keep the baby and decided to place her for adoption.  My friends from Cali. adopted her last Fri.  Tess was born on Tues and I was with her the whole time.  Talk about a beautiful experience!  They were discharged on Fri. and ALL came here, along with the adoption agency people to sign papers.  It was intense, heartwrenching, beautiful and exhausting.  So many emotions!  Lots of significance for me to watch a baby born on March 1 and to see signs of spring around me, considering this exact time last year I was diagnosed and was in a very different place.  It's so interesting to once again see how joy and sorrow can be experienced at the same time. It's going to pouring here today... good day to put my \"nesting\" urges to use :-) hugs to all of you!   Daiva ",

Day ~  I, too, have loved your info on the herbs.  It never bores me and I am always up for learning more.  So please keep sharing with us and no, we don't find it boring.  Sorry to hear about your misfortunes.  Patricia ~ I got my hands on a copy of Noises Off - will let you know what I think.  Drim  and GolferGirl ~ congrats on your last treatments! (and to anyone else who may have finished). Leanna ~ what do you mean about asparagus?  I have read it's great for you, but do you do something special?  Good luck with your tx. Summer ~ are you a martini girl?  I love espresso ones.  Went out for dinner last night and had a good dirty martini with some delish olives.  mm...   I'm regretting it now, because i am awake and keep vowing that I want to clean up my diet some more and cut back on the alcohol.  It's just not easy to do at this particular time.  Not to mention, I love wine - though I'm finding that red wine messes with my sleep :-(   Also, I wanted to ask you about Tim Tam - how do I PM her?  I can't find her to do that.  SOS.  Have you checked her site?  I'm dying to. Sacphotomom ~ I love my juicer too.  What are your favorite juices to make?  And how's your dad?    Irishtess~  it was nice to hear your 4th tx was a breeze.  I'm not looking forward to mine but reading your comment helped me relax about it a bit more. Barb ~ did you find anything out about your ankles?  I feel like my whole body is swollen!!!  Paxton ~ I'm thinking about you and your situation.  I'd send my teenage daughters over to help you if you lived nearby.  I'm sending up a prayer for you this very moment.  Hugs to you! I'm taking my daughter, Leah, to NYC today.  She's getting some headshots.  We're catching the bus from Baltimore and returning tonight.  I thought it might be fun before tomorrow's chemo.  I can't wait to close my eyes and listen to my meditations.  They are helping me a lot.  I'm getting so tired of not sleeping through the night.  It only compounds the fatigue I already have.   Ladies, we're doing this and we're going to make it though!  Soon enough, we're all going to look back and it will be behind us.  My heart goes out to those just starting on this journey.  We are survivors and we're going to thrive! ",

Njbhwgirl~ it would be fun to hook up in Monmouth!  Any word on lung x-ray results?  Re; exchange - my PS thinks that DIEP is best way to go, though I'm leaning toward gummies and taking the chance that I won't get contractures due to rads.  Lots of info out there!   Leanna~ will send you a good pork chop recipe for crock pot if you like chops.  We're with you in spirit today!!!!!   You always get so much done before chemo - organizing, cleaning, etc.  I should be more efficient when I get that boost from the steroids. Paxton~ thanks for sharing your journey.  I find it interesting that you weren't so freaked out because I think it would be SOOOO tough!  Re: hair coming back - I'm freaking out b'c I see white hair coming in - NOOOO!  I want to shave it because I can't see walking around with a white/gray crew cut :-(  How long did it take the first time for color to come back?  Also, Gage is precious!  What a gorgeous child!  And the cake looks delish!  I immediately thought of Day and how she would have liked a piece :-) Summer~ your fever and bone pain sound all too familiar!  except I didn't have to go to ER.  Hope you're feeling better.  My TE aren't so bothersome right now and I have been able to lay on my stomach for a little while now.  The massages have been wonderful!!!!  I'm going to PM my e-mail as well, would  you mind sending me the recipes too?  I am meandering to the mall today to buy a bigger pair of pants - :-((((((( Judy ~ so sorry about the eye.  And 80/37 - yikes!  How are you feeling now? Patricia ~ thanks for the reminder about good choices and occasional treats.  My definition of \"occasional\" needs to be looked at.  Walking is really that good?  Do you push to go fast or just to keep moving for a certain amount of time?  Did some yoga yesterday and it really worked out some kinks and stiffness. Redbarb~ I'm right there with you - ups and downs emotionally; lack of sleep, exhaustion.  I think I'm going to try extended release melatonin to see if it helps with sleeping through the night.  The social worker at my onc.'s office said the transition at the end of chemo can be tough for many people.  DancerMel's article sure confirmed it.  Do you meditate ever?  I wonder if that could help - get your hands on some good cd's maybe.  We're all in this together - you're not alone. DancerMel ~ thanks for the article.  How are you doing today? Drim~ -20 degree caps - talk about brain freeze!  Did the caps hurt?  Glad you were able to keep your hair - yay!  I find when I wear my wigs I get angry.  I'd rather wear a baseball hat and be bald.  Something about the wigs that bring up something in me.  Can you not dye your hair?  It makes sense it would be dry...  all the drugs coming out through the scalp and into the hair.   Sacphotomom ~ hurray for the nubs and no neulasta!  It's funny, my nubs are freaking me out because they're white/gray and I want to shave them off.  Too bad we can't jump straight back to a good head of hair.   Day~ can't wait to try your Romanian cabbage - it sounds so much like what my mom used to make.  Lithuanian and Romanian cuisine probably has many similarities.  Have you ever tried \"Ayr\" nasal gel for your nose?  I get it at the grocery store and it really helps with the dryness in the nose.  Yea, if I had gorgeous waist long silky hair I'd miss it too!  I love the pic!  Gorgeous!  So where in the world does one get walnut and pecan leaves?  Most of us don't have them growing in our yards - boo hoo!  Hope you don't lose AC today.  I guess you can go for a nice drive and hang out in the air conditioned car...  Stay cool. ",

Patricia - buff headgear?  I might have to look that up - esp. as the weather cools off.  Denise ~ I wish I didn't still love wine, but I do.  Onc. told me one glass a day is ok - hmm...  or in moderation.  I must cut back!!!! Irishtess ~ can't they stop and resume when you return?  Glad you didn't back down with your \"no\"! Leanna ~ hurray for a better tx.  One more to go!  Hold that finger up like Wellsey's rider does:-)  DH and I might go to Riviera Maya before rads for a quick anniversary celebration.   It needs to be somewhere sort of close and not too pricey.  An all inclusive sounds great to me!  Hugs to all of you! ",

Ditah~ great name!  What nationality?  Sorry if you mentioned it before - can't remember.  My glasses broke and I was told to wait to check my eyes in a few months due to chemo as well.  So I have readers all over the place.  I found great glasses (purple) and almost used my rx from 12/09 but decided to be prudent and wait.  Yes, chemo has messed with my eyesight as well. Paxton~ sorry about the colds.  Sounds like you're bouncing back nicely though.  No need to rush on the recon. Latte~ good thing you got your picture taken earlier!  I see pics of myself and wonder whose round puffy face I'm looking at. Magda ~ what is Zoladex for?  So neat to hear what the chemo did to the tumor size!  Hoping you won't need rads.

So here's my update:  bilat. mx 3/26/10; last chemo 9/1/10; start rads 10/20 x 33; then tamox 5 yrs.   Will find BRCA results next wk and will determine if I need ooph.  DIEP 6/7/11. I'm praying they were wrong about the $40 copay each rad tx - ouch.  Gotta call ins. today.  Simulation yesterday - was blue about it - not 100% sure why.  I just don't want more done to my body and am tired of being tired.  It is what it is and I'll take one day at a time.  It helps to hear that it's already behind some of you.  My TE are no longer painful and the rotated one will just have to stay like that til recon.  Really no big deal.  Hugs to all of you ~ Daiva ",

So good to spread the word!  Theresa ~ how are the burns?  Denise ~ any SE from rads?   Have you had 9?  I think we started the same day.  Jersey ~ I'm using something for my lashes too.  It's like Latisse.  My friend gave it to me.  I think all that stuff works.  I only lost some of my lashes - and my brows thinned out a lot.  Thank God for makeup - nobody can tell when I put my \"face\" on.  They're delicate so I usually go au-naturelle unless I'm going somewhere special.  Day ~ it's good to hear the recon is an easier ride! Have any of you had an oopherectomy yet?   Someone told me it's best to go to a gyn oncology specialist because the ovaries have lots of tissue around them and the surgeon must be skilled with cancer?   Does that make sense?  I have an appt tomorrow with my gyn.  My onc wants me to have a pelvic sonogram and then proceed with the ooph.  I think I'll wait til Jan - after the holidays. Hope you all have a great day!   Tess, Jenn,  Patricia, Barb, Kim, Paxton, Linda Jen and everyone else I missed - hugs to all of you!   ~ Daiva ",

Sacphotomom ~ I just started reading Exchange City last wk. and am also starting to think about it.  The T.E. on my left side seems to be placed a bit too laterally - and it's starting to concern me.  My rad. onc. wants me to resume my fills and complete them before radiation starts.  That was a different opinion than the other rad. onc. I saw at Hopkins.  Hmm...  I'm still debating on the flap vs. implants as well.  You mentioned tim tam site - what is that? Leanna ~ Hooray for your DH getting a job!  That's got to be a relief!

Patricia ~ well, how were the RBC's?  Hoping to hear good news.  Hopefully the heat will break soon.  It's amazing how much easier it was to walk in Cali. since it was only 70 degrees.  My legs are feeling it - yay! njbhwgirl ~ that just stinks about casting for recovery - I'd talk to them and see if they'd be flexible. Summer~ your bone pain from Taxol sounds exactly like mine - only mine lasts 4 days - all jumping around between hips, ankles, shins, back, knees, femurs.  I don't know if it's from Taxotere or Neulasta - but it's enough to make me want to jump out of my skin.  Oxycodone helps in my case.  Ouch! Leanna ~ get your counters yet?  Hope your gut is better - you might want to try some fresh ginger. LibraryJenn~ happy anniversary!  3 hrs is a long drive - I'd look into Sacphotomom's idea.  It just sounds exhausting.  Johns Hopkins has places that patients and their families can stay at nearby.  Even if it was for a few days a week.    I'm off to meet a friend fro a walk - am determined to get out there everyday!  I can hear Patricia's voice telling us that our choices matter and make a difference  hugs ~ Daiva",

I'm still in Toronto (since Mon.).  We just got back from a 2 night stay at my brother's lake house.  I can hardly believe how much and how well I slept.  It's amazing how different it is when you can take the \"mommy hat\" off.  I'm here alone.  I've also been taking Melatonin (extended release) to help me sleep.  The Lunesta does nothing for me.  I'll be curious if it helps once I get home and in my own environment.  My dad (88) made me the best cabbage soup ever!  He's thriving and so healthy.  I had the thought at one point wondering if he'll outlive me.  Ouch!  I find those types of thoughts lingering around my head at times. It's been so wonderful to be around his positive energy and to be the recipient of lots of love here.  I'm grateful.  Pleasant dreams, dear friends!",

I just discovered that my family designed t-shirts for my last chemo day.  They have pink boxing gloves on the back with my name on them - along with the final chemo date 9-02-10 (just like the show that used to be on).  It's nice to be on this end of this part of the journey.  Think about all the women logging on to BCO for their first time right now.   If anyone ever has free time, it might be worth jumping in on one of the newer groups with a word of encouragement.  Remember how scary and overwhelming it was at first?  Off to \"try\" to get some sleep...   Hugs to each of you!",

      "Content": "Jul 6, 2010 09:14AM - edited Jul 6, 2010 09:31AM by x-raygirl Wow, I'm in Toronto visiting my dad and it's almost 100 degrees and he has no A.C.  Too hot for my wig (Fiona).  My DH and 3 kids are at home in MD and it's SO nice to sleep when I want and to not worry about much of anything.  I did go shopping for a bit yesterday and go really bummed about my wt. gain.  I can't let that get me more depressed.  Decided to be kind to my body right now and just do the best I can - limiting sweets, drastically cutting back on alcohol, walking 30 mins. daily, and incorporating yoga.  I refuse to critisize my body right now - it's going thru so much.  My acid reflux is much better since onc. told me to take Prilosec.  Acupuncture and B12 shots seem to help with fatigue, so does extra protein.  I can't remember if it was here or on Exchange City, but I read that Costco sells protein shots made by Body Choice - 25 mgs. protein.  I know it's best to get it from food, but I can't seem to eat enough protein.  I read that while undergoing chemo our bodies need to repair and that requires half our wt. in grms. of protein.  I think it's helping with fatigue - yay!  Btw, I did get new panties - they make me walk straighter and feel sexier :-)  Nanof2 ~ my next tx is 7/15 ~ just after your 4th.  Are you in a clinical study too? Summer38 ~ thanks, I found Exchange City.  Are you leaning towards implants?  We're in the same boat re: sizing, etc.  Keep me posted.... Patricia48~  thanks for the reminder of giving our bodies love and comfort and kindness - I needed to hear that!  btw - how's Tuffy?  Mine is called Fiona and looks like my own hair.  People often stop me and ask where I get my hair done - LOL!  I'm still more comfortable wearing just a baseball or newsboy cap.  Sacphotomom~ hurray for normal blood counts!!! yes, I do take amend in addition to dexa and T.  Can't remember how long the drip is. Wellsey66~ we're on same regimen TC q.3wks x 6, then rads.  I'll be doing Tamox, though.  My 1st tx was 5/13.  Good luck with the gloves.  The nurses told me to keep polish on my nails and keep them groomed and that the  first sign of anything to put tea tree oil on them.  I'm glad you mentioned eating organic b'c of ER pos - somehow I hadn't made that connection. LibraryJeann~ I looked up Body Talk in my town and will be calling the practitioner when I return from my visit with my dad.  It's right up my alley!  Glad you got a port - it's the best, eh? Redbarb804~ lucky you!  no weight gain!  Yes, I'm in a clin. trial and that's why I'm having 6 tx.  I now get it.  My 4th tx is 7/14.  No, I'm not taking additional steroids, just the 3 days and I.V. on tx day. Leanne~ you have a lot on your plate!!!  chemo, young kids, work, SE, etc.   I'm saying a prayer for you right now and sending you good vibes.  I don't get why you'd have to pay $45 if you don't get your wig there - that stinks!  I know what you mean about getting tired vs. poor me has cancer.  I feel like I'm in the middle of a marathon and it's hard to keep the positive attitude.  Have you ever heard of Louise Hay?  She has some awesome affirmations that have helped me.  One day at a time, right?  You are not alone and we're hear for you to let it all out.  We'll listen.  Hugs to you...  Fotopet~ it cracks me up that your place is in a nudist resort.  Inspite of the fatigue, I hope you had a nice get-away.  I just love that you could bare it all!   :-) Ladies, we're in this together!  Lets keep our heads up and  be a little extra loving towards our bodies today.  They are fighting for us and we will come out thriving in the end!",

This is the first day since my tx on Thurs. that I have been able to get out of the house.  Luke, my 9 yr. old and I juiced some veggies this morning - he was  \"into it\"  today.  We made a trip to Costco and then I went to the coffee shop that sells Brassica tea.  It's got broccoli extract in it - I thought it might help in supporting my immune system.  Wow, after a few really bad days, I really appreciate a decent one!  I ran into a woman at Costco who is a 2 yr. survivor - it picked up my spirits even more after talking with her.  She looked vibrant and healthy.  Right now, it just seems so long away.  So I have a question:  not to be morose, but do you guys think about your mortality?  Maybe this is not the place to discuss this and it's ok if it's dropped like a hot potatoe.  I just am finding myself wondering if I will be one of the ones who \"makes it\".  Thoughts are swirling in my head - not in a depressed sense, but in a sobering way.  I try to envision myself as thriving and healthy, but not everyone survives this nasty disease.   I know it's a process and no one can answer these questions for me - I just can't ignore them.  As far as today goes, I choose to be present to whomever I'm with.  I look forward to hearing about Emma,  my 18 yr. old's, trip for college orientation.  I choose to be grateful for the blessings in my life - both big and small.  This group is among my blessings - thanks for being there!",

Sacphotomom~ how's the spine pain?  My DH wanted me to quit the Neulasta because of the amount pain I was experiencing.  My onc's office said, NO WAY!  It would be too risky to get a nasty infection that could land me in the hospital.  Be careful!  I hope the pain has subsided.  Re: the long brows, you may want to trim them.  Mine are getting sparse, but I still trim them to make them look groomed and then pencil them in lightly.  I've exposed my head to the sun in small amounts to get some color on it and have even put some self tanner on it so that I don't look so sick.  Hope you enjoy some pain free better days this week! LibraryJen~ 8x8cm tumor?  How do they measure it at the onc's office?  Or do they send you for a scan?  I liked what you said about writing your fears in a journal.  Then they're out and not just swirling in your head.  I'm going to do that.  I don't want to ignore those aspects of the disease, but am trying to focus on the positive and on living, thriving, etc.  There's a balance in there and I'm trying to achieve it.

Paxton~ Have you tried rinsing with salt water and baking soda for the mouth?  You may want to try tea tree oil for the breakouts as well.  My daughter swears by it!  Just a heads up - it's got a strong smell!  I know what you mean about \"chemo face\".  I'm right there with you! Summer~ I bet my swimming tube is bigger than yours! I still haven't found out my KI-67 - hoping to call Hopkins today.  Someone yesterday told me that her onc.'s office gave her cancer markers each time she had blood drawn.  Anyone ever hear of that?  I don't even know what these markers are - though I've heard of them.  My fingers are crossed that I'll be chosen for Casting For Recovery in MD.  It's a fly fishing retreat, with a limited number of BC patients/survivors.  I've heard it's wonderfully bonding and healing.  I got the idea yesterday that I might sign up for belly dancing classes - LOL!  Low key and fun - right up my alley :-)   Sorry to be so long today.  Cheers to you, my warrior friends.  Have a blessed day.  ",

I had an opportunity to go to the neighborhood pool by myself yesterday.  I listened to an audiobook on joy by Christian Northrop and took a snooze.  It was 100% lovely!  My head got some sun and I feel like I look healthy.  I like the look with my new blonde wig, named Lola.  My GF and I got a great walk in the morning as well - funny how great it felt.  I just wish I could muster the energy to do it daily.  Yes, that is my goal.  Boy, the bad days sure make the good days that much better.  Just like the sunshine after a storm, or rain after a drought.  Yesterday was  gift to me.  I'm working today - Lola is going to make her grand appearance.  Hugs to each of you.  I'm saying a prayer for all of you right this very minute.   May Chemo Warriors ~ we CAN do this!  And we WILL get through this!  love you guys! ",

GolferGirl~ Lucky you that there's a naturopath at the onc's office.  I hope you share what he/she tells you.  I'm a hungry hippo as well. Patricia~ hope the RBC's stay up and no need for a tranfusion.  I've got a tat as well - actually a few.  My first one is on the inside of my ankle, an angelic symbol for \"release\" - letting go... as in letting go of old patterns that don't serve me well, letting go of control, etc.  It's brought me strength.   My newest one is on my wrist and it's a friendship symbol.  I have about 8 GF who also got them in solidarity with me to show their support for me during my battle with BC.  It's been overwhelming to see how many people love me and support me.  They are both Zibu symbols and I love them!  Like you, I'd love to meet everyone in this group - wouldn't that be quite a get together!  who knows... maybe one day. Day~ glad you got your chocolate cake - yum!  My sleep is all messed up as well - crazy schedule.  I look forward to hearing about the hair recipe and how it works.  I've been using Nioxin to keep the follicles strong, etc.  I can't believe yours is growing already!!! Summer ~ sorry about the reaction again :-(   My walking hasn't kept up either and I keep planning to start again.  The bone pain sucks but just remember it's better then landing in the hospital with some nasty infection due to low blood counts. Cleob ~ I love your positive strong spirit! Jenn~ aren't there any anti-nausea drugs that help?  How 'bout phenergen suppositories?   I love my CFK cookbook too - have you tried the curried cauliflower soup?   Kim~ LOVE the bald look on you - it rocks!  Hurray - you made it to your last tx.  Now, to get past the crappy days following it, right?  Sending positive vibes your way.  Sacphotomom ~ great quote! njbhwgirl ~ now I get the name - thnx!  My daughter will be going to Monmouth Univ. at Jersey shore this fall.  I love the Jersey beaches!  Re:  casting 4 recovery - I'm surprised they wouldn't give you your own rm.  Everybody is different and at least you know yourself and your needs.  I just found out I'm on the list if someone cancels, so I don't know if I'll be going or not.  It's not til the beginning of October.  I hope your lung issues clear up - sending up prayers for that. Drim ~ How's your hair back already?  wow!  How long did you have to wait between chemo and rads?  You may have mentioned it already, just can't remember. PackJen~ I, too, wonder if this BC will come back and end up causing my death.  I try to visualize myself healthy.  In the end, I just try to make my days count and live life to the fullest.  I hear you loud and clear about the weight and the jowels - yikes!  I just bought pants yesterday that were 2 sizes larger than my normal size - boo hoo! Paxton ~ I can't imagine going thru this again.  I'm so sorry this is a recurrence for you.  When was your first BC?  What tx did you have?  Sorry about your ER trip.  I hope you have a restful time at the lake and happy bday to Gage!  Kudos to you for speaking up about the Avastin!  Rest up and enjoy the lounge chair. Barb ~ fingers crossed for clear margins.  Sending up prayers on your behalf. Leanna ~ sorry about the rough week.  At least now your garage is clean - was DH surprised?  It's such a good feeling!  Re: tumor, have they talked about surgery?  Please God, let that tumor shrink for our friend!  Stay strong, girlfriend!   Am I the only one who likes being bald?   I'm finding it so much easier getting ready.  The wigs are hot and there's nothing like pulling it off and feeling free!  I also feel proud when I'm out and people see me...  Yes, I'm battling breast cancer and I try to keep my head high and show them that it's not beating me down to nothing!  It's inspired those around me and I find that gives me strength.  I might just keep shaving my head for a while until winter when I'm ready for it to grow back.  Another question:  does anyone have darkness that has developed around the ouside of your eyes?  I have dark spots on the corners of both eyes - weird.  I need to google Onco Type testing - what does it tell you?  I found out my Ki-67 was 18 - is that on the low side?  I can't believe how much there is to know and learn.  Sometimes I feel like my head can't take any more info!  Well, DH and I are taking off for San Diego this morning.  No kids.  He'll be in meetings during the day and I will be free to do my own thing.  I'm really hoping I can get into a good novel and escape BC for a bit.  Sunny California, here we come!   Sorry this post is so long - I just had to catch up.   I'm so grateful for this group!  Thanks Fotopet for pulling it together - and congrats on being done with your treatments!  Hugs to each you ~ Daiva   p.s. - running out of time so I can proofread this...  ciao for now.",

Tess ~ sorry about the liver panel.  I'll be eager to hear how that unfolds. Have you looked up foods or supplements that detox the liver?  Even hot lemon water each  morning on an empty stomach is helpful   Thanks for the lavender tip - will definitely try it.  Jenn~ what a nice coworker!   I find that these random acts of kindness people do for me so touching!  I guess they're not so random, but they mean a lot. Magda~ hope your blood counts were good and tx was uneventful.  Getting closer to the end!  Glad you're on FB - love seeing Prague. Denise ~ it makes me sad to hear about your sister.  I'm spoiled!  Glad your neighbors have stepped up - mine have too.  Yes, I'm a blond on FB :-) Theresa ~ NYC firefighter.  I can't imagine all that emotion to deal with.   I hate being center of attention too!!!!!! Paxton ~ good for you for walking!  I keep saying I will...   My emotions are all over the place too.  It's such an emotional rollercoaster!  I think we'd all agree. So I got stopped at security yesterday.  There I stood, had to take my hat off, spread my legs, arms out...  the metal detector beeped over each breast.  I explained I have tissue expanders with a metal disc, etc.  Then she had to \"feel\" me - me and my hard TE (opted for no bra yesterday).  Oy!!!  Also, onc. called saying my vit. D levels plummeted.  I insisted on having level checked and it's a good thing I did.  There's a strong correlation between BC recurrence and low D levels.  Might want to get yours checked ladies!",

Leanna~ how neat...an essay about you!  Post the link when it's up - you'll have my vote. Paxton ~ I wouldn't rush the recon if it's not sitting well with you.  You could always go for a PS consult just in case you'll change your mind.  I don't blame you for a minute wanting to wait til Gage is a bit older. Beth and Ditah ~ it never hurts to double check with BS re; the pain.  Mine is great at responding when I shoot them an email. Jenn~ 5 hr. trip would wear anyone one out -  you go daily, right? (to Saskatoon).  The countdown is on - yippee!  Nails lifting?  Doesn't sound good - I dodged that one.  I only got white stripes across each nail - weird.  Hurray for the emu oil!  Btw, loved your skype idea! Denise ~ congrats on Andria's news.  Do you like her fiancee?  I agree with you about the wig, I just don't feel like myself with it.  You look great! Patricia~ I hope you have a fabulous time with your sister.  It's probably SO good that  you've been walking as much as you have.  Please pace yourself while there.  I'll be thinking of you and waiting to hear all about it.  There are lots of interesting spas and acupuncture places and such, maybe you can recharge mid trip.   Safe travels.... Jen~ Tahoe!   Lucky you!  Hair trimmed already?  Yay!  I can't wait to be sitting in my hairdresser's chair and getting a trim.  I always loved getting my hair done!  You are looking fabulous! Laura ~ how's it going being back to work?  I am still so fatigued that I can't imagine.  Are you full time? Jersey ~ my heart is still happy about your no mets news!!!!!!!  How was NYC?  Did you use the rooftop pool?  I'm going to see Jersey Boys in a few weeks in Baltimore - from what I hear, everybody likes it. Magda~ dear Magda, don't be hard on yourself.  Perhaps it's Tamoxifen related, but I think we're at a different part of this journey and it's hitting us what we've been through.  Make sure you try to incorporate things you love to do in your days, things that make you happy internally.  If you keep feeling down, maybe talk to your dr. about options.  Right before my official BC break during the holidays, I thought I was depressed.  I'm feeling better now, but I think these transition periods are tougher than we realize.  I'm praying for you today.  (HUGS)  I'm scheduled for the ooph Fri.  Tomorrow I am going for another consult re: recon - it's such a big sx (DIEP) that I need to be 100% sure about who will be performing it.   My sister is going to Puerta Vallarta in Mexico exactly a week after my ooph and has offered to buy me a ticket if I want to go with her.  Has anyone had an ooph?  Do you think that's too soon to travel?  My wbc was out of normal range when i had my blood work done (too low).  I'm not sure if it's a good idea.  Any thoughts?   Oh yea, my tumor markers and PET/CT scan were all normal.  I didn't believe it til I saw the reports with my own eyes.  The PET was a follow up because of something they were concerned about the first time I had it.  My onc wanted to double check about my hip pain as well.  All clear!  WOOHOO!   It was a relief!   I also saw a Naturopathic Dr. last week - WOW - so much neat info.  We're doing some testing - will keep you posted.  One thing she did tell me, was to drink 6-10 cups of organic green tea daily.  That's a bit much for me, so I use 2 teabags at once in a large mug and make it strong.   Google green tea benefits - you'll see why.   Sorry for the long long post.  Hugs to all of you, my dear May Warrior friends.  ~ Daiva ",

Summer ~ was the party today?  how did it go?  or is it tomorrow?  Hope it's a blast! Judy~ yes, my husband gives me the neulasta shot the day after tx - I dread it b'c I am one of the ones who gets bone and joint pain.  It's not fun in the least.  A nurse suggested I take claritin the day before, the day of, and the following day to help offset the SE.  Unfortunately, it didn't help me last time.  That steroid and hyper combo is for the pitts!  I wonder if anyone has taken sleeping pills?  I have just toughed it out and gotten a few things done with the extra energy. Leanna ~  love your new profile pic!  Gorgeous!!!  For the record, I wasn't impressed with LGFB either.  I did, however, get a nice Chanel pallette that I use daily - the rest of the stuff was cheap and nothing I'd ever wear. I went to Hopkins with my best friend to Image Recovery to pick up my prostheses - my clothes look better with them popped in my bra.  Since I'm gearing up for round 4, we decided to go to one of my favorite  restaurants on the way home and enjoy a couple martinis. Espresso one, then chocolate - YUM!!!!   We laughed and laughed and talked and talked.  Oh yeah, we also got pedicures.  It was so therapeutic.  My goal is to do something super fun the week of my chemo treatments.   I'm off on Wed. so still plan on something fun that day - not sure what yet.  I so want to be a survivor who THRIVES.  It's not something that will just happen by chance - I'm amazed how much mental and emotional energy it takes to try to stay strong.   Dear May Chemo Warriors - lets strive to thrive through this hellacious experience.  ",

I want to embrace this time and learn all I can.  Life is such a great teacher and I want to come out wiser, stronger, and better as a result of all this.   Patricia ~ will check out heavenly hats.  It's good to hear your onc. respects Simonton.  I know there are lots of quacks out there.  You mentioned spring water in the past - are you particular about what brand of water you drink?  I have a filter that's in my refrigerator and sometimes wonder if that's sufficient.  Your Sweetie sounds like a keeper! Njbhwgirl~ last fill already?!  how many cc's are you at?  I'm still curious what the initials stand for...  Good luck Wed. and pls keep us posted. Kim~ great story!  I think you should put the wig on and post a pic for us. Summer ~ Timtam told me she had to sort some things on her site first.  Were you able to get to the pic forum?    I'm still fighting off this darn UTI.  Will call dr. this a.m. since I'm at my nadir pt. today.  I also had the runs yesterday - maybe wbc are down too.  After my last tx. I had GI issues right around this time with lots of fatigue.  Do any of you take probiotics?  I'm thinking my body might need some.  I don't know too much about them but am going to look into them.  The temps here in MD have finally broken.  We've had too many 100 degree days.  Yay, I might actually be able to get a walk in without wilting.  You guys inspire me and motivate me in many ways.  Thanks to EACH of you (even the ones I didn't mention today) for your posts.  I, too, mention my chemo-warrior friends often in conversations.  I learn a lot from you and am grateful to have you.  Hugs ~  Daiva",

My onc. told me had he known about how badly my ankle was swollen after the last tx and that I had shortness of breath issues, he would have sent me to ER.  A reminder to all of you - chemo and tumors both make you more susceptible to blood clots - so be careful!  Anyway, I missed keeping in touch and just wanted to touch base.  I've been reading posts from my phone - not the easiest.  For those of you on AC - I wish it was easier and feel like a baby compared to what you are going through.  Thank God that life's journey is filled with peaks and valleys and we don't stay in the valley forever.  Wishing you all a peaceful day!  ~ Daiva ",

Redbarb~  I'm right there with you - worried about the fatigue factor.  It's so not like my usual self and I want my energy back.  I hear it gets bad near the end of rads.  Keep me posted on the best tips you hear or find. LibraryJenn~  love your pic!  #1 - you look SOOO good bald!  #2 - great fish!!!!  oh yeah, hip polish too.  I keep thinking I'll try blue but I feel like I might look like I'm trying to look too young.  I'm 48 and my 17 loves blue polish.  Maybe I'll try it on my toes...   Girl, your tumor is 8x8?  I'm praying the TH kicks it's butt and your next report will be like Leanna's.  Can't you visualize it?  Shrink, dam tumor, shrink!!! Irishtess ~ the end of this chemo crap is near for you.  Hope your 7th tx didn't kick your butt too bad.  Ireland sounds delightful!  I just watched P.S. I love You and it made me think of you and your place there.  It was a heartwarming and romantic movie.  Love the accents!  Cheers to moving along in our treatments and seeing the end of this particular tunnel! Sacphotomom and Paxton ~ those emotional days are so hard for all of us.  Paxton - I love Kabat Zinn!  I have tried to see all the things I have to be grateful for this week and it's made such a difference in my perspective the last few days.  In the midst of my most blue days and nights, there are still good things around me and I have to consciously remember them.  .Sacphotomom~ thanks for the compliment.   That wig is Fiona.  She's natural hair and is very much like my real hair.  I like kicking it up and spiking it, etc.  My other one is Lola - blonde and peppy:-)  Glad you felt a bit like your old self today.  Don't the bad days just make you so much more grateful for the days you feel good? Kittycat~ welcome to our thread!  I can't chime in on AC because I'm on TC x 6 wks.   Question:   Does anyone have an issue with gas after tx?  OMG - I'm a tooting machine and don't know what that's about.  I haven't eaten cabbage or anything gassy.  Also, my onc. gave me Hydrocodone (instead of oxycodone) - hate it!  It last 8 hrs and wigged me out!  Fortunately, the bone pains have subsided quite a bit today.  Pleasant dreams to all of you!!!!!  big hugs ~ Daiva ",

      "Content": "Oct 11, 2010 04:28AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 04:55AM by x-raygirl Good morning friends!  So we returned from a fabulous trip to Vegas.  We saw 2 Cirque de Soleil shows:  \"O\" and \"Love\".  Both were phenomenal and I highly recommend them if you get a chance to see them.  I had amazing treatments at the spa and some much needed time with DH.  Other than the tissue expander problem and pain (which I will have checked out today), it was a great time.  I'm glad we opted not to \"squeeze\" in a trip to Venice - esp. because I had a hard time walking due to the pain in my boob.  Has anyone else had a rotated TE?  I can hardly believe some of the comments I heard while away:  \"my  mom had BC 4x - she was a survivor too, though she passed away at the end\"; \"my mom died of BC - what a horrible way to die.  I can tell you will beat it because of your strong spirit and the fight you have in you\";  \"sorry you have to go through this, I watched my sister go through the same battle\" -  How is she, I asked.  \"She died\".  OK people, do you REALLY have to share this with me??????  Sometimes I wonder what the heck they are thinking?!!! I have an appt at Hopkins re: my fills today; simulation for rads this week; and genetic counselling/BRACA testing Friday.  No dull moments.  I kept putting off BRCA testing because I didn't think emotionally I could handle knowing if I could be positive.  I need it now to determine whether I need the oopherectomy.  The thought of my teenage daughters having to ever go through this makes me sick!  I will have to just deal with it. Denise ~ thank God for happy pills.  How long do the docs usually wait for port removal?  Girl, hope you're feeling a bit stronger each day. Leanna~ Thanks for the hugs.  Sounds like a busy weekend.  I can't believe your sx is so soon!  I can't remember - are you going bilateral?  I wish I had my recliner when I had the sx.  A friend offered to lend me hers but we ended up buying one.  I lived in it after we got it.  Also, do you have one of those \"Lets Dish\" places near you where you can go and prepare a bunch of meals at once and freeze them?  You may want to consider that if you have such a place - might come in handy and your mom could pull them out and just bake them as needed.  Re: your mom - I loved the idea of making a list for her - even if it's simple things that are obvious to you but she may not think of.  We'll be here cheering for you and keeping you in our prayers, girlfriend! Magda ~ glad they lowered your T.  I'm impressed that you are keeping up with work - not sure how you've been able to manage it all.   Hey, go easy on yourself re: the fatigue and wanting to stay strong, etc.  I'm trying to be kinder to myself because I have expectations of myself that are hard to live up to at times.  When I don't, I get down on myself and that's not right.  Our bodies are fighting hard and working so hard for us and we should talk to ourselves like we'd talk to best friends.  Btw, I think of you when I look at this beautiful Czech plate that my friend brought back for me from Prague. Have a great day May Warriors!  xo  ~  Daiva ",

I've walked a few days in a row and even got a short hike in this weekend.  I forgot how good I feel when I get moving and fill my lungs with fresh air.  Now to make it a habit!   Question:  does anyone else have knee and hip pain?  Perhaps it's due to the extra weight I'm carrying?  I might pick up some glucosamine.

Beth and Leanna, tonic water has quinone in it and it helped me a lot during my pregnancies when I had that kind of cramping.  It's great with some lime in it.  Just drinking a bit a day helped me signficantly.  Will write more later.  Be well! ",

I'll be thinking about you today as you go for your MRI and praying it's nothing more than that. I have dropped by on the boards here and there but it's usually not when I have time to give an update (like now). I'll get on when I get home later. Sending a big hug to each of you, my warrior sisters! I think of you often. -Daiva",
