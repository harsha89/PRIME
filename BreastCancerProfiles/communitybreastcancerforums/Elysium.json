      "Content": "Elysium wrote: Hello,  The brief synopsis here is that I have had greenish drainage from both breasts since at least 1996. I have fibrocystic breasts. I've had a mammogram that showed something on the outer left quadrant of left breast. Been to several docs who just shrugged me off in spite of the fact that I complained of terrible pain and heat in both breasts that seems to be cyclic. Now I have many.....MANY swollen and palpatable lymph nodes in both armpit muscle areas. ( feels like peanuts in cottage cheese - very lumpy, even along muscle )  I went to the doctor last Tuesday. She expelled drainage from right breast and it was the same old greenish color. When she expelled drainage from left breast blood came out of one duct. The left breast feels smaller than the right one. Should I be concerned?   They drew blood to test my prolactin levels, TSH, and TRH levels. Waiting for results. I have Oct 15th appt for mammo and pap. In the meantime I'm a little freaked out and my \"partner\" isn't exactly supportive. Emotionally unavailable. I feel like I'm totally on my own here. Thanks E. When your legs fail you, be ready to fight on your knees. Log in to post a reply",

The size discrepancy is newly noticeable. I haven't seen a specialist yet so there has been no mention of node removal. I am uninsured - the clinic I went to this week is a sliding scale women's clinic and I saw a PA, not an MD. She is summoning my records from my cardio and GP doc as well as from the hospital where I was admitted last Oct for pulmonary edema and other symptoms. I just talked to a friend who said that she had bloody drainage when she had mastitis but she had no lumpy nodes. Thanks again.",
