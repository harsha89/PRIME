This will be a New Year to remember for me! My oncologist wants me to meet with the radiation oncologist at the beginning of January for the initial consult. I've been told that I will \"most likely\" need 30 radiation treatments. How long have those of you who had chemo needed to wait before you could begin radiation? Thanks!",
