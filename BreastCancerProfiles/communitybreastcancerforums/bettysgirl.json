I agree you need to talk with the onco and look at all the suggestions. I am not going to lie. Chemo is tough and there are some really bad days. But I was fortunate enough to be able to work throughout chemo with about three days off after each tx. You manage the side effects as they come, you come here and vent and find answers and then you take each day at a time. You will find out that your inner strength will rise up and you will surprise yourself as to how tough a cookie you really are. Best wishes as you move forward.",

I ws out a few days after each tx and have missed more days since i started the taxotere but i am still there. I have been lucky that they are flexible and understand that i am a little more tired some days an i have been allowed to come in later. You have to make the decision yourself but the nausea meds are good, my onco is good about not wanting the se's to deter my life too much and he is very helpful with that.

Don't rush into surgery unless you know all the facts, and are comfortable with the decision you make.I didn't want to wait either but the CT, PET and other tests gave us more info and i went into surgery knowing it was going to be a mastectomy, if we had not waited for the MRI i sould have been surprised as the mamogram didn't tell the whole story. Take a deep breath( and a Xanex) and know that there is a lot of support here. As far as nodes you won't know that until they do a sentinal node biopsy/ and or surgery.

You will find your strength. You have to allow yourself to walk through the emotions, have a grumpy cat kind of day and them move on to the next hurdle. I am glad to see that you are here. You will get great advice here from oldies and newbies alike.  I found chemo to be quite doable and never got sick and worked throughout the process. That doesn't mean there were not tough days, but you seem to be able to move forward and go on to the next hurdle. I had read all about the side effects of chemo and was also terrified. I guess i had made is seem so horrible that is wasn't as bad a i anticipated. rads were not too bad for me either. I had no fatigue, went everyday at 4 and did not have a breakdown of skin until the last two weeks. I found a great chemo group here on BCO and we have been close ever since. I do not come here as often as i used to but i pop in from time to time. Know that you are on our hearts and minds and in our prayers. You will sail through this and have a story to share.

I was also a DD and it is an adjustment to have them gone. Immediatly I was aware that weight was gone. (7 lbs) Some days I am fine with it and some days I am saddened by the change in my shape. It is a long story but the only recon option i was given was the shoulder flap and that wrote any idea on recon off for me. I go flat. I have not worn nor been fitted for a prosthesis. I wear layered shirts. It is a big decision and one that you have to be comfortable with. I knew that i never wanted to have to go thorugh that dx phase again with the other side and with the history of all the fibrocystic cysts it would have been a possibility. Of course you have to know that on the elective side (in my case) they do not take as much tissue and thus there is breast tissue left for a chance of recurrence... I am sorry you are having to go through this. I also hate BC. It is something I wish no woman ever had to go through.

I will echo what was said before stay ahead of any nausea you do get. Fluids are key. Drink while you are being infused. The more liquids the faster your system can get the meds working and flushed through your system. You will have to see what tastes good to you, somethings you liked won't be appealing. Someone told me to get lemonheads candy if you get the metallic taste but i was lucky and did not get that. The biggest complaint i had on taxotere was that eveything tasted like cardboard. I was able to work all through chemo with a few days out after each treatment. And my hair did fall out on about day 15...BUT it will be over before you know it and you will be on the road with NED. There will be some unpleasant days but you WILL come out on the other side and you will know that you gave the BC the big guns and survived it. I wish you all the best. Lisa",

This website is also wonderful for searching info. I know the gut reaction is to have surgery fast & first..Hopefully yours is small and early. Mine was a larger tumor and I did surgery first..if i had to choose again i can see the benefit of chemo first (if needed at all) because you know how well the cancer responds to that particular treatment. Before surgery if you are going to have any recon work you need to consult with a plastic surgeon prior to surgery for advice. You probably won't get the referral to the rads oncologist until you have completed surgery. I wish you the best of luck as you move forward. Take things a day at a time. If you have questions, come here and someone almost always has an answer. And with the vast group of women and time zones there is almost always someone online. Good Luck to you!",

In my case the MRI was totally important as it showed the true size of my tumor. They did my Sentinal node biopsy first to see if there was node involvement. Once we knew there was I was the one that asked for a PET scan prior to surgery because i had been a smoker for so long. Looking back i can see where chemo first is a good option because you know it is working on your tumor. Some people want to know everything and some don't. I read a lot of books, studied online but the most important and helpful info came from other survivors themselves. Talk to someone you know personally that has had surgery and been through the journey. Talk to the ladies on here. You need time to think through all your options. One of my good friends is a doctor and her BC was very aggressive...she was the one that told me to breathe and think all of it through..you do have time.

Sorry also about the constipation..that seems to come with it for some. Mine tends to run the other way. At least now you know how better to manage things the next go round.

My hands never peeled but did look chemically burned after the first taxotere. I was also out of commission for almost a week. VERY sick. Had to go back for fluids and steroid two days in a row. Pain was horrible and I slept for almost the whole first week. BUT my onco listened to all I described and once I showed him my hands he told me it was an indication that the dosage was too strong and we lessened the dosage for the second tax. It worked for me. It didn't make taxotere easier but did prevent the previous problems. We had also discussed that abraxane woul be the next move if i continued to have problems. It is a wicked drug. Lots of people react to it. Onco told me it is the preservative that they are reacting to and that abraxane has a preservative that is more of a human protien and that is why they don't react to it. I know how frustrating it is. While I was having all my problems my onco was out of town. I told the nurse he was going to have to give me a good reason to come back and do Taxotere again. Thankfully when I went back he sat and listened to me for a long time, (almost 30 mins) and we lowered the dosage. So sorry you had this experience. Thankfully we all survived it.",

I had no problem brushing my teeth or my hair but the hair was much more difficult. Do what you tolerate.

In the end I lost all fingernails and toenails. Fingernails have recovered and are beginning to grow. Most of the toenails are back with the exception of the two big toenails that are much slower growing for some reason. It is aggravating but they will come back.

Buy things to prepare for both. I was out of work for about 3-4 days after each FEC treatment and a little longer after each taxotere. My hair fell out in about 15 days also. I wore a wig to work and scarves or nothing at home. I had thrush after each treatment that was worse after taxotere. With taxotere everything tasted like cardboard..you have to seek things that taste good. Lots of water and or gatorade is highly suggested. I had a port and was glad i did. Never had any trouble with it. I nursed my nails during chemo and treated them with strengthening polish and thought i had done real well, no discoloration, no blackness and all of a sudden one day one fell off, quickly followed by the rest and soon to follow were the toenails.. My hair started growing back during the taxotere and was a thin covering of down by the time i finished 6 wks of rads. When it came in it did come in curly but i lost my chemo curls quick. There were some days when i wondered how chemo could go so smoothly and some days (like after the first taxotere) that i wondered how i was gonna do this.. You take a day at a time, pray a lot and I was a part of a group of girls on here that all had chemo in Sept of 08. Find a group and hopefully you will bond like we did. It does help because you all can compare stories. Chemo is like birth stories..sometimes they grow worse with time or you forget the pain...Either way it helps to have supportive people around you that know what you are dealing with. I wish you all the best. You CAN do it!!",

There were a few girls in my group that did react but not quite as bad as you desrcibe. They would stop the drip, give oxygen and benadryl and wait before starting the drip again. We did see one that had a severe reaction on her second infusion and they were going to have to try something else. The first infusion i had i was sooo sick and out of things for about a week. My hands looked like they had been chemically burned. I had to go back two days for fluids and steroids. We had to lower the dosage and i did better. But at that time the onco told me that it is the preservative in the taxotere that most people are reacting to. Abraxane is a kind of sister drug to taxotere but uses a human protein for the preservative. You may have to change to that or another drug all together. I hope that you are feeling much better and that your onco figures out the best plan for you. Take care BG",

You have to do this for yourself but also for those who love you and need you to be there for them. We will be praying for your surgery and a quick recovery to follow. As the other girls have said, take it a step at a time. You WILL be able to do this. Sommhow we summon the courage to forge ahead even when the mind tells us we can't. All surgery is scary and this one brings up so many emotions..let yourself cry when you need to then move on to do what you have to do. We will be here to listen when you want to rant, rave and cry. Best Wishes to you",

As far as the mush brain i am on fec right now also and it was worse the first treatment than this time although there are times where i just feel like i am in a fog and know that i am not as sharp as i should be. I do beleive there is a chemo brain effect...although i think it is also a combo of fatigue, stress and the illness itself combined with all the drugs we take for SE's. Hope you feel clear again soon.",

The initial days and weeks right after you are diagnosed are the worst. Once I got into the active treatment phase and had a plan mapped out it eased the worry some as i was finally soing something. Don't look too far down the road take it in a little at a time and know that there are women here who can answer your questions, listen to your rants and cheer you on a bad day. While all of us wishes we didn't have to be here it is a WONDERFUL site for support and you will meet many new SUPER cyber friends. Best wishes to you Lisa/Bettysgirl",
