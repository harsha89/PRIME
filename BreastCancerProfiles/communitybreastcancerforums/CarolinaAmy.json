I may have to do it yet again because it STILL is leaving a large bald area at the front of my head (think of a line drawn from the fronts of my ears over the top of my head) and also bald atÂ the cowlicks. Did anyone else have this, and does it stop?? I'm hoping it will start coming I'm normally once the final chemo works its way out, but it kills me to shave the hair that IS coming in.",

      "Content": "Feb 18, 2016 05:00PM CarolinaAmy wrote: I just finished my final chemo on Tuesday!! I did have hubby buzz down the patchy, strange hair growth again Monday night. It was coming in perfectly thick along the ears and wrapping around the back of my head, but the crown/cowlick areas and the front patch above my forehead were about as bare as they were the entire time. It looked so much more pathetic than flat-out bald. :( I decided to finish chemo, give it a few weeks, and see if it starts coming in a bit more properly. I figure that if I'll have to cut it to get it even at some point down the road anyway (2\" hair in the back, 1/2\" in the front???), I might as well start over and see if it can start together. I did notice that the hair he buzzed off was that 'sewer rat' color. Yuck. I'm 41 and I was surprised, when it came time to shave my head during chemo, that I didn't have a single gray hair. I've expected it but never found one. Looks like I'll be making up for that in spades, at least for the time being. What's funny is that the eyebrow/eyelash thing has bothered me so much more. I think that the wigs/hats/scarves look kind of cute and more like a fashion statement. Losing the eyebrows and eyelashes is where you look really \"cancery\". Ick. That was definitely when my best friend said it broke her heart because I'd turned some kind of corner and now LOOKED sick. I'm preparing myself for the likelihood of losing what little I have left and repeating that process a few times based on what y'all are saying. My sister is regrowing her hair after going through chemo and radiation for colorectal cancer. Some jackhole in WalMart (naturally) made a comment to his companion yesterday that, \"I hate when women wear men's hairstyles\". She looked right at him, grinned, and said, \"I love that I don't care at all what you think.\" YOU GO, GIRL! But I really wish she'd followed that up with the reason for that hairstyle. Unless he's a stone-cold psychopath, he would have died of embarrassment right there and I would have paid money to see it.",

It's just insanely patchy, which to me looks worse than being bald. But since I head to surgery tomorrow I figured I'd just let it go and see what happened rather than continuing to buzz it all off until it comes in evenly. We'll see what happens. And I think we need to make a policy that until we get our eyebrows/eyelashes back and have enough hair to be a style, the leg hair can just HOLD ON A BLOODY MINUTE!",
