I had my yearly mammo done and I was called back for a diagnostic Mammo and ultrasound.Â  I then was told that I need a biopsy. I have still not yet talked to any Drs...just the imaging place to make appointments.So, I decided to go and pick up my reports to see what is going on. This is what my report says: Increased soft tissue density and approximately 3.8 x 2.1 cm area of prominently increased number of mostly pleomorphic microcalcifications in the anterior periareolar upper-outer right breast. zthere are mildly dilated ducts in retroareolar region. Abnormal echogenicity such as abnormal acoustical shadowing is seen. There is suggested dense fibroglandular tissue in the area evaluated. Stereotactic needle biopsy recommended. Can anyone give me any insight? Please... I am going bonkers :/ Log in to post a reply",
