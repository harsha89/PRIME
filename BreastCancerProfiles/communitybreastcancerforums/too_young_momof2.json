I went to my family Dr with tiny water blister type things on my legs, he said it was folicilitice sp? I was put on antibiotics but it never went away. I then went back for blood work and have developed 3 what I thought were boils on my bc side in a line starting under the \"breast\" to back rib cage, GP put me back on strong anti biotics. I went to see my plastic surgeon today for an assesment on my open wound from the 3 failed recon and asked him if my skin infection had anything to do with my bad healing problems? He looked at it and said he is concerned and said if they are not gone by my next visit he is doing a biopsy. One is quite large about a quater but the hardness underneath is much larger. They are not leaking fluid and there are no heads and are very hard??? I am very concerned now and cannot find alot of info! Please please any info?
