      "Content": "Always09 wrote: Hi, I am having a biopsy tomorrow. This is something I prayed I would never have to do again. I just finished radiation 3/27/18. Diagnosed with IDC right breast 12/12/17. My 6 month mammogram shows calcifications. After 2 hour diagnostic mammo radiologist recommended this biopsy. Oncologist says 2% chance of reoccurance after just finishing 32 radiations 6 months ago. I don't have a good feeling. Same breast very close to same spot. Anyone have this kind of experience. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
