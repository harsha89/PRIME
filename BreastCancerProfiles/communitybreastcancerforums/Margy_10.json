I went to a doctor who originally said \" don't worry, it's just sinewy tissue\" then I went to family planning who were absolutely wonderful and booked me in for a mammogram & ultrasound. The results were a highly suspicious frankly malignant calcification and lump. How does that work....highly suspicious & frankly malignant? i struggled to get my head around that! I had the guided core biopsy on Thursday and now await the results. Like you, I automatically think the worst! I have a teenage daughter and am recently separated so I'm not coping as well as I should be. I can't sleep at night and worry about missing all the important milestones of my daughters life. I keep thinking why didn't I go to the doctors sooner? Why didn't I do things differently and why now that I'm on my own. My friends have been wonderful, but it doesn't help at 2am in the morning when I'm laying there worrying about the worst case scenario....It's my daughter's birthday on Friday so I haveÂ delayed my results until Wednesday. I figure I want to spend this week with my daughter and savour every minute and deal with the results after her birthday...This is definately the worst part.....waiting",
