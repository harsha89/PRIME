Know that you are doing exactly what you need to do, you are searching for answers....do not stop until you figure out what is going on. I know that it will seem like forever until your biopsy date - it will seem even longer until you get the results. I have to keep my sense of humor about it all, or it makes me crazy. I hope that your journey for answers is a quick one, and that you don't forget to smile - at least a little - along the way. It is so easy to think the worst while you are dealing with the unknown..... Hang in there - Robin ",

My nipple looks funny when I lay down too Christine...very different from the other...sunken is a great way to describe it! Oh yes, before it cleared up, my breast started to shrink (measurement at MRI in 07 - one was 10.9 the other 9.2)! My doctors all made me feel very crazy...so I quit going...it eventually calmed down, and I was content to ponder life's mysteries! Flash forward to Dec 08 and it has started all over again - we have named it nipplelotopus...you might have gawked too long if....you named it!! I now have aching in my armpit and a dull baseball sized ache in middle back on that side. So far have had diag mammo, u/s (both clear) and biopsy (done by a plas surg this time - the last guy butchered me with just a puch biopsy) - get my stitches out, and the path report on Friday! I am sure it is nothing, because all the doctors that I have seen have said so....when they figure out it is nothing, I am going to get a job as a model for before and after augmentation - having two different sized boobs can have it's benefits! Stay vigilant, and be your own advocate....try, try, try not to worry....I believe that the diagnosis process can be worse than finding out whatever is going on. Knowledge is power! (Spoken by someone who has had to do this already once before for no good reason!!) Wow - did I say I was going to make a long story short? Sorry!  Robin P.S. - I have also found great comfort in reading so many stories of so many brave people who are battling the known and unknown...I have posted rarely, but been here often. The stories here are inspiring!",
