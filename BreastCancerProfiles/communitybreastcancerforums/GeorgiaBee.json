I have very large breasts (G cup, yea I'd like to have a breast reduction in the next year or two) and at my recent annual Gyno visit, the Dr. noted that I have fibrocystic areas in both breasts but found no palpable masses. I went for my Mammogram and liked the Radiologist doing the scans. When I was leaving she basically told me in a roundabout way that I would be called back for more images because as she put it, \"there's a lot going on\". I wasn't too freaked out because this happens to my sister frequently and she has had several Ultrasounds and was cleared after those. Anyway, I got my results and I'm worried because there are 3 \"concerning\" findings. Making matters worse the 1st available appointment for my Diagnostic Mammogram is not until the middle of September. The Radiology report and some relevant history are below. What do you all think? Anyone else had results with multiple areas of concern? I feel pretty sure I'll end up requiring an Ultrasound at least (in addition to Mammogram images). Also, I don't want to end up on the Merry Go Round of always getting abnormal results in the future and requiring lots of additional images and biopsies. I've read how stressful this is for women who deal with this. I know prevention is key, but this whole process is so darn stressful & draining and to have to go through this every year, geez! I had several benign fibroadenomas removed from right breast in 2000 My Mom & her sister were both diagnosed with postmenopausal DCIS (Ages 61 & 60) and were treated successfully after lumpectomies My Radiology Report Findings: The breasts were heterogeneously dense which may lower sensitivity of mammography Finding 1: There is an asymmetry seen in anterior inferior region of right breast (This is the breast that had fibroadenomas surgically removed and there is a large scar on the right side) Finding 2: There are 2 focal asymmetries seen in the middle upper outer quadrant of the left breast Impression: All areas noted above require additional mammographic images, spot compression & tomographic views are recommended and an ultrasound may be warranted.
