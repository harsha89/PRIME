My mother also had a stroke about ten years ago that resulted initially in paralysis on her right side. Immediately after the stroke she could not even feed herself. After many months of rehab her only remaining impairments were that she walked with a cane, and her formerly perfect Palmer-method handwriting was ever so slightly shaky. She credited her recovery to the many prayers said on her behalf, but I think her own determination had something to do with it, too. It sounds like your mom is equally determined. So there is hope. There are things she can do to support her immune system to help fight the cancer until she is strong enough to resume treatment. My primary care doctor told me the day I was diagnosed about a very helpful book by a physician who is a cancer survivor himself. It's by David Servan-Schreiber, and the title is Anticancer: A New Way of Life. Servan-Schrieber combed the medical literature looking for things that would help his body fight the cancer and prevent any more recurrences, and then he compiled what he found into this book. He has very detailed recommendations about foods to eat more of and foods to avoid, and nutritional supplements to take. It's not a substitute for conventional treatment, but it helps make conventional treatment more effective. One nutritional supplement he does not mention - probably because he sticks to things that have been proven in clinical studies - is a nutritional supplement called Coenzyme Q10 that has shown promising results in a handful of breast cancer studies in Europe. You might want to check that out as well. Bless you for your devoted advocacy and support for your mom, and bless your husband for supporting you and bringing your daughter to visit her grandma - I bet your mom loves seeing her. I know it will be a long haul, but I hope you get good news in the end. (((Hugs.))) Anne ",

I am thinking I might step up the doses of my immune-supporting nutritional supplements when I have to go off meds - I'm taking coenzyme Q10, omega-3 oil capsules, and calcium as supplements. I might just add an extra capsule a day of each. What do you think of that approach?

You're right about the beets & brussels sprouts - those are both cancer growth inhibitors, says David Servan-Schrieber. (Anticancer: A New Way of Life, Anticancer Action section, page 11.) He charts veggies in order of how much they inhibit cancer growth - they go like this: Garlic, leeks, scallions, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, broccoli, radishes, savoy cabbage, onion, turnips, green beans, red cabbage, asparagus, fiddlehead fern, spinach, beets, potatoes, jalapeno peppers, red chicory, cucumbers, orange peppers, celery, squash, and Boston lettuce.

I haven't talked with Dr. Khan personally, just her staff. So I am thinking now I might just ask my doctor to refer me to MD Anderson for a second opinion. I am not ready to throw in the towel on the idea. The research seems most clear that surgery helps if there's only one met, or only bone mets. There's no clear benefit if mets are extensive or visceral. But mine are in between those cases: four small bone mets, plus several tiny lung spots too small to tell if they're mets. So I feel I need more evaluation.  I am bummed that there seem to be no clinical trials yet. It would have been so nice to have been assigned to one arm or another and let that make the decision for me! Thank you for checking back with me! ",

He basically agreed with everything my medical oncologist had already said. He thinks the small lung mets are probably cancer; he agrees that they're too small to biopsy; he thinks the lump I had in 2006 was probably cancer all along and not the \"benign cyst\" they concluded at the time (and didn't biopsy). So his conclusion is that surgery won't extend my survival, because I've had the cancer a long time, it's had plenty of time to get out into the rest of my body, it's in my bones and lungs, and he expects I probably have micrometastases elsewhere that are just too small to find. He said \"But there have been times when I've been wrong,\" though, and it's my decision. Even if I do decide on surgery, he confirmed what I had surmised from the Internet, that nobody at this cancer center does DIEPs. He would do immediate reconstruction with implants, but I don't want implants. My onc said yesterday she'd give me a referral if I wanted one. From what I've read on the Internet, the folks who are leading the charge at studying long-term survival in Stage IV patients are the docs at MD Anderson in Texas. So I guess I'll be on the phone to MD Anderson tomorrow morning. I'd be more convinced that surgery wouldn't help me if I heard it from the people who believe it does help in some Stage IV cases. I haven't heard anything yet that convinces me I'm not among the group who could benefit. So my plan at this point is to get a second opinion about whether there's any benefit to surgery at all, and then to explore going to NOLA for immediate reconstruction with a DIEP if it seems there is a chance I'd benefit.  At least there's no hurry - my hormone therapy is still working beautifully; everything is still shrinking. So I have time to do my homework. Thanks, everybody, for your support and info. ",

Elaine, my sentiment exactly - I keep wondering \"why is this my job?\" But at least the docs are clear that it is my decision and they won't stand in the way of whatever I decide to do. Linda, I'm so glad your lung nodules were not mets, and I hope your next scan shows they haven't changed.  Wow, Darlene. That was grim but helpful - I appreciate your being so frank. That made something my surgeon said make so much more sense. He said he wouldn't recommend surgery with the goal of extending survival, but he would do it for managing symptoms in the breast. My unspoken reaction was \"but that has nothing to do with me - I have no symptoms and my tumor is getting smaller every day.\" I wasn't even thinking of the eventual day when the cancer will progress and what whatever is left of the tumor will do then. Thanks for making me go there. It makes sense that I should deal with it early while I am strong and healthy. Mammalamma, thank you for that sweet story. Your note reminded me of my 5-year-old the other night. She is trying to get her head around this whole \"death\" idea. She knows that both her grandfathers died before she was born, but she doesn't really have any direct experience with the idea. So she asked me if our family knows anyone who has died after she was born. I thought hard for a moment and then told her the only person I could think of was her grandma's friend Frances who lived across the hall from her and who died last winter. Do you remember Frances? I asked my daughter. She pretended to remember and nodded, clearly wanting to hear what came next. So then I told her that Frances had been a very nice lady who had been a teacher when she was young, and after she died a lot of people who had been her students came to her funeral and talked about what a good teacher she had been. That seemed to satisfy my little one and she stuck her thumb in her mouth and curled up in my lap and went to sleep. I guess we all want as much information as we can get! Thanks so much, everybody, for sharing yours. I am going to call MD Anderson tomorrow and see if I can get evaluated there. Anybody got an answer for Princess' question? Anne ",

My oncologist is pursuing the strategy your Doctor 1 is recommending, and it's working well for me - but one reason she chose this strategy is that my pathology reports showed my tumor is greater than 90% estrogen positive, so in my case hormone therapy is the most effective strategy. It really matters a lot whether your particular cancer is estrogen positive, HER2 positive, etc. and how strongly. At least one of your doctors should be considering this. If they're not, I'd recommend going to one of the major cancer centers (one that's NCI accredited) and finding out what they recommend. I see you're in Wisconsin - any chance you can make a road trip over to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN and get evaluated there? I had an evaluation there and they agreed with my oncologist that I'm likely to get more benefit from hormone therapy than from chemo. This really gives me additional peace of mind that we are doing the right thing. Good luck to you! ",

I think that's an additional reason I'm getting good results. I am very grateful that so far I have been able to forego chemo.

My oncologist thinks it was cancer all along. She told me that any time the mammogram technician can feel the lump, they should biopsy it, even if the imaging suggests it's benign. \"Sometimes the imaging is wrong,\" she said. If you want a biopsy for a palpable lump and your doctor is dismissing your concerns, it's time to see a different doctor. You are young and so the odds are very good it's nothing. But if it's something, you need to find it early. The young women who do get breast cancer tend to get more aggressive, fast-growing cancers than older women do. Catch it early and your odds of a cure are still overwhelmingly good - but you need to catch it! Trust your intuition, tell them about your family history, and get pushy if you need to. You have our permission! Good luck and I hope it's benign! Anne ",

I only have four bone mets and only the two in my spine ever hurt, and those not often, and when they do plain old Tylenol takes care of it. No fractures yet - it was a routine mammogram that caught my cancer; I did not even know I was ill. Walking into the infusion bays to get my Zometa and Zoladex every month, I feel conspicuous, like I'm too healthy-looking to belong there. My friends keep offering their sympathy and support and asking what they can do to help - but I don't feel sick! Even the anxiety hasn't been bad because the hormone therapy has been working and the tumor's been shrinking. And whenever I post here in the Stage IV board I feel like I'm posting in the wrong place. Is there a place for people who are newly Stage IV but so far pretty much symptom-free?

Like your doc, they recommended doing chemo before surgery to reduce the tumor size, kill any cancer cells that might have spread - and allow the doc to see how well the chemo is working by observing how much the tumor shrinks. There are different kinds of chemo, so if one kind doesn't work, there are others they can try. But I couldn't be treated at Mayo because it was out of my insurance network. So then I got referred to another very good oncologist at the University of Minnesota, and she ordered a PET/CT test which showed I wasn't Stage III, I was actually Stage IV - because I had 4 small bone metastases. Bad news with a silver lining. It was too late for chemo to beat my cancer before it spread, because it already had. My tumor is strongly ER positive, so in my case, hormone therapy is now the best strategy. So that's what we are doing, instead of chemo. If you don't have metastases, your prognosis is better than mine - you caught it before it spread. I remember how awful it was when the news seemed to be worse with every visit. But lately the news has been better with every visit. My hormone therapy is shrinking my tumor, and next month my oncologist is going to check to make sure my metastases are under control. If they are, I'll get referred to a surgeon, and we'll get this thing out of there. Your Doc 2 sounds like he's on the right track. The more info he has, the better job he can do of finding the right treatments to beat the thing so it doesn't spread and doesn't come back. There are things you can do, too. There's a book by a doctor who himself is a cancer survivor that talks about changes in diet and exercise you can do that will make your treatment more effective. It's called Anticancer: A New Way of Life, and the author is David Servan-Schreiber. Our local public library has it - maybe yours does, too. This book says a half-hour walk each day has been shown to extend survival in breast cancer patients, so I have been doing that. I've also cut out most of my junk food, as the book recommends. With the better diet and the exercise, so far I've lost 10 pounds, which is a nice benefit. I feel stronger and feel like I'm doing something to help my treatment work. You've come to the right place. There are a lot of sisters here who will share what they've learned and offer you support. I'm glad you're here. Good luck to you. ",

My marker blipped up when I started treatment, and my onc said that could be because of dead tumor cells. Then it went back down again and is now close to normal. My onc says she pays more attention to whether the tumor is shrinking than to the markers. Make sure you exercise regularly - it helps your treatments work better. I bought a treadmill and have been walking on it a half hour a day.

Some women on this board have had good results, some with no side effects. You can put \"Herceptin\" into the search box and find threads where they've discussed it. I have been on Tamoxifen for nearly 4 months now. I am happy to report that my results have been great (I see you saw them in my signature line) and my side effects have been minimal. The only ongoing side effect I've had is hot flashes, and they're pretty mild. Just the occasional, \"Gee, it's hot in here ... oh, right.\" I figure I would eventually have had them with menopause anyway, so they don't really bother me.  I also had one experience of cancer \"flare,\" which happens sometimes at the beginning of Tamoxifen treatment, which is where the cancer flares up before it begins to shrink. I have two small mets in my spine, so the flare gave me serious backaches for a week (so serious I could not get in and out of bed without help), mild backaches the following week, and then the backaches went away. While I was having them, they were manageable with Tylenol. You probably won't have any flare with Tamoxifen because your surgery will remove all your cancer before you start taking it. If you should happen to get nasty bone pain after starting Tamoxifen you might want to ask for a PET/CT scan to make sure you don't have mets. It's an expensive test (thousands of dollars), so they may not order one for you unless there is some reason to suspect mets. From what you've said it sounds like they caught your cancer early enough that mets are unlikely. Since you are a newbie, you may not have seen any of the other times I've recommended a book that has helped me a lot. My primary care doc told me about it. It's Anticancer: A New Way of Life by David Servan-Schreiber. He's a physician and cancer survivor who combed the medical literature for evidence of lifestyle changes that can help fight cancer, and this book is the result of that search. This board is a great help, too. I hope you learn as much from it as I have and that you get wonderful results from your treatment! ",

This is when cancer has spread beyond the lymph nodes to other parts of the body. In my case, since I neglected to get a mammogram for 2 1/2 years, by the time my cancer was diagnosed, it had already metastasized - it had spread to my lymph nodes, four of my bones (two of which are in my spine), and possibly my lungs (the lung spots are too tiny for the scans to show whether they're cancer or not). When I started Tamoxifen, the bone spots flared up and that's what caused my backaches. At the early stage your cancer is at, it is unlikely that you have mets, but it's not completely impossible. The most accurate way to test for mets is a full-body scan called a PET/CT that makes the cancer spots \"light up\" on the images, but it's a very expensive test, thousands of dollars. Insurers don't like to pay for a PET/CT if there's no indication it's necessary. I don't want to worry you - you caught your cancer early and it's unlikely you'll have to worry about mets. Just wanted to let you know that if you had bad bone pain in your first few weeks on Tamoxifen, it could be mets flaring up, and then you would want to ask your doctor about checking for mets.  In my case we already knew about my mets before I started on Tamoxifen. The results of my MRI showed I had fairly advanced cancer - a large primary tumor and at least three lymph nodes involved - so my oncologist ordered a PET/CT the very first day she saw me. Congratulations on catching yours early - you should do well! ",

I just had a little spotting - thought it was nothing - oncologist said see a gynocologist. In quick succession, a biopsy, referral to gyn onc, D&C, long story short - it's endometrial cancer. A separate cancer, not a new metastasis. Caught it early - still only grade 1 cells. Odds are good (80%) that surgery alone will take care of it and I'll be back to just fighting the breast cancer. Gyn onc says it's rare for someone to have both cancers. She thinks it's extremely unlikely that the tamox would've caused it 'cause I've only been on it 6 months. Never took birth control pills. Never had HRT. Nursed all 3 of my babies. Baffling. Gyn onc thinks it may be genetic and will refer me for genetic testing.  Have been reading all night, books & web. Have learned that there's a genetic condition called HNPCC syndrome that increases risk of colon cancer (which my mother's brother died of), stomach cancer (which my mother's aunt died of), and endometrial cancer at an unusually young age (I'm 50, which is young for this), among other cancers. Have also learned that there seems to be no alternative to hysterectomy for this. Questions I have for all you good sisters: - Anybody with experience with HNPCC syndrome? - Anybody know anything else that might have put me at risk for both cancers? - Is it really true that I have no choice but to have the hysterectomy? - Anybody know any good resources for how to have a good outcome from hysterectomy, avoiding the common side effects?

If I have the surgery, I get to keep the Tamoxifen, which has been doing a great job shrinking the breast tumor and the bone metastases. So I'm not looking for ways to get off Tamox!

A friend of mine researched the question of whether it's possible to do both hormone therapy and chemotherapy at the same time, and learned that apparently it's risky. So they look at the biopsied tissue and figure out which therapy will be more effective on that particular cancer, and just do one or the other at a time. If the hormone therapy does not work for your mom, they can always switch her to chemo later. If it works, she may not ever need chemo! Good luck and good wishes. Anne ",

My cancer is over 90% estrogen-positive, so my oncologist chose to start with the hormone therapy. The way she explained it to me is that chemo is faster, so they'll use that first if your cancer hasn't already spread, in hopes of beating it before it does spread. But if it has already spread by the time they find it, then they'll use the more effective therapy, which in my case is hormone therapy, even if it takes longer. (Apparently you can't do both at once because there are risks involved.) As for the surgery question, there is currently research going on to investigate whether surgery extends survival at all in patients who are Stage IV at initial diagnosis. The early research seems to show that if you have very few or only one metastasis, and only in bone, then having a mastectomy can add as much as 18 months additional survival, but if you have widespread metastases throughout your body, then surgery doesn't extend survival. I am in the middle - I have 4 bone metastases and suspicious spots in my lungs that are too small to confirm, but they've been shrinking in response to therapy so we assume they're cancer. But nothing in my brain or liver. So will surgery benefit me or not? I don't know, so I decided to go to the experts. So I am getting an evaluation from MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, where a lot of the doctors who've done the research on this question are based. In fact, my appointment is tomorrow morning. We'll see what they say! Good luck to you and your mom. I hope she gets great results from her treatment! ",

I want also to echo what several have said that you'll need to find out more about your particular variety of cancer before you can accurately assess how much benefit chemo may be for you.

I had a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist tell me that in my case, he thought I'd get more benefit from hormonal therapy than chemo, and it looks so far like he's been right. Whether you choose chemo or not, there are some diet/exercise/lifestyle things you can do that will help your treatment be more effective that have been clinically verified. A doctor by the name of David Servan-Schrieber has documented them in a book called Anticancer: A New Way of Life. My primary care doctor recommended this book to me the day she diagnosed me. I have been following many of Servan-Schreiber's suggestions and I believe that's a major reason my tumor has responded so well to hormone therapy. My oncologist said it's one of the best initial responses she's ever seen. Servan-Schreiber is a physician and cancer survivor who combed through the medical literature after he experienced a recurrence, looking for ways to change his lifestyle to reduce his risk. This book is the product of what he learned.",

I came here wanting to hear what people think. I appreciate your honesty - thank you. I'm familiar with the \"NOLA in September\" thread - I spent a lot of time lurking there when I was a newbie, and it may actually be where I first got the idea to learn more about NOLA. It's been so long now I don't recall for sure. An immediate DIEP was what I was hoping to do when I was first diagnosed when they thought at first that I was stage 2 or 3. Then the PET/CT revealed the bone mets and the biopsy revealed how highly estrogen positive the tumor was, so the whole treatment plan changed to no mastectomy at all at that point. But now 20 months down the road it appears we need some method of local control. And the thing is, I just don't want anything in there any more that isn't me. No tumor, no implant. Just my personal \"ick\" factor. I'm looking forward to having the beastie gone, even though I realize I'll have to fight my way through several months of recovery. A year ago I had an easier surgery - a laproscopic hysterectomy - and the surgical recovery from that went well for me, much better than I expected. That makes me cautiously optimistic.",

The slight progression we observed in November became definite progression in a few weeks. So we switched me from Tamoxifen to Anastrozole (generic Arimidex). We still needed local control of the tumor, though, and soon, because it was impacting the skin, bruising it and threatening to break through. Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Stolier kindly worked me into their schedules and I had the mastectomy with immediate DIEP on December 15. (Dr. Massey was in Charleston all month and not available at NOLA, and I wanted NOLA.) Dr. Stolier called me before the surgery to warn me about the risk I'm taking by doing immediate reconstruction instead of delayed - his recommendation was to have radiation in between - but I explained to him my multiple reasons for wanting to avoid radiation and he was willing to do the surgery anyway so long as I understood the increased risk of local recurrence. I'm writing this at five days after surgery. I'm out of the hospital, I'm off narcotics and just using Tylenol, I've been showering without help for two days, and I did ten minutes on the treadmill this morning at 1 mph. I don't have any lymphedema yet, and I hope to keep it that way - we'll see. The flap seems fine, the incisions seem fine, the drains seem fine, and I hope they will come out at my post-op appointment later this week. If current trends continue, a recovery of a few months looks much more likely for me than one that takes a year. I think the thing that'll take the longest to resolve will be the breast incision - I was not able to have skin-sparing after all because the tumor had impinged on the skin too much and the skin had to go. So I have a big patch. Fortunately, the skin tone matches pretty well. If anybody in similar shoes to mine is considering this, the one thing I wish I had known a year ago was that waiting until the tumor threatened the skin would make it impossible to spare the skin. If you are stage IV and you want a mastectomy and your doctor won't give you one, this might be an argument you can use - doing it earlier may provide a better cosmetic outcome. I am looking forward to seeing how low my next CA 27-29 will go now that the beastie is gone!  Thanks, everyone, for sharing your experience and helping me think this through. ",

The author also had young children - her youngest was 3 at the time of her treatment. You and your daughter might enjoy this book; it's beautifully written and inspires hope. The title is Not Done Yet - Living Through Breast Cancer. The author is Laurie Kingston. The publisher is Women's Press, an imprint of Canadian Scholars' Press Inc.

(I'm early stage IV - at diagnosis mine had already metastasized to 4 bone sites.) Apparently the advantage of chemo is that it is faster. My oncologist told me that if I'd been diagnosed at Stage III they would have done chemo first, but since mine has already metastasized they are using hormone therapy first because for my cancer it's more effective, although it takes longer to work. It sounds like in your mom's case, there may be other considerations to think about besides speed. Since her cancer's >90% ER, it might be worth asking her oncologist about trying hormone therapy first. I hope all goes well for you and your mom, too - thanks so much! ",

      "Content": "AnneN wrote: Hi, everybody. Last time I posted it was to check out for a while because I had just started a run for the state legislature. As a Democrat running in a Republican-leaning district in a Republican-leaning election, of course I did not win, but I got a respectable 38.39% and I'm not too sad or embarrassed. I loved campaigning, met a lot of great people, learned a lot, and had a great time. People are already encouraging me to run again two years from now, assuming I am still healthy enough, and frankly, that encouragement feels great. Of course, the last couple months before election day I was very time-crunched and got a little less careful about diet, exercise, and sleep. That fickle Stable Boy apparently took offense and is flirting with leaving me. The mets are still stable, but the primary tumor has started to sloooooowly grow again. And my CA 27-29 tumor marker numbers, which had stayed stable in the mid-50s to mid-70s for a year and a half, have started slowly climbing; the most recent one was 99. Rather than switch me off a (mostly) successful drug regimen, my onc recommends getting local control of the tumor and keeping the drugs the same, since they're still working at controlling the mets. She suggested radiation, but I told her I would rather just do a mastectomy and get the tumor out of there. (Plus I don't like the prospect of radiation side effects.) My onc is okay with that as long as I do it soon - she is concerned about the tumor eventually breaking through the skin. I have started talking with Dr. Marga Massey about mastectomy with an immediate DIEP sometime early in 2011, probably at NOLA. I am 50% nervous and 50% excited to get it dealt with and start recovering. In late March I am scheduled to do a workshop at a conference in my field, and the thought of having my surgical recovery behind me by then and being back on my feet and moving on with my life just sounds so appealing. So even though I just lost an election and have to deal with this little bit of progression, I am feeling surprisingly good about the whole thing. That said, if you know of any pitfalls/cautions/concerns/issues I should be considering, please feel free to chime in. I always welcome your advice, sisters.
