(I was also pre-menopausal.) They both talked about \"tolerating\" AIs and that some women need to try different meds to see what works best for them (with least umber of side effects). If your uterus is out, Tamoxifen is still a possiblitiy if you don't tolerate the other AIs very well. This is whaty they explained to me. Good luck.",

The recovery was super-quick, and the pain was gone after a couple of days. I handled it just fine with Advil. My surgeon's nurse said that, yes, the robot (laparoscopy) is awesome but that women have to remember about all the stitches on the inside and remember to take it easy. She said that most people feel so good after it that they forget that there are still limitations for a while about what you can do. I hope yours goes well, too!",

The pain a week after both axillary surgeries has been brutal. It's still not gone three weeks after the most recent surgery. As far as I've read, most people say it's nerve pain (the nerves regenerating or the nerves having been damaged--mixed theories) and that most pain relievers won't help, including Oxy. My surgeon didn't warn me, either, and when I asked her about the pain at my second post-op appointment, she said to gently massage it (which I've read on a couple other posts here at BCO, too). I am not a big fan of this because IT HURTS TO TOUCH. But I'm trying it. I'm seeing a PT/Lymphedema specialist in a week, and I'm going to ask what I can do about the pain. I hope you get some relief! I'll be thinking of you. Kelli",

I did get tired about four weeks or so in, but I turned the corner on the bone-crushing fatigue about ten days after my last zap. (I'm still tired but more from ten straight months of treatment, not from the rads.) I can confidently predict that the radiation techs/nurses will be wonderful and will take very good care of you. You may have some skin discomfort (I didn't really--a little itchy from a minor rash), but they will be looking at you every single day and will help you with whatever might come up. Take care of yourself.",

IndyMom, you might bring that up with your surgeon because it does show that premenopausal women ER+/PR+ have an advantage with ovarian suppression. I was BRCA negative. I had not only an ooph but a complete hysterectomy. (I'm 47 now.) With the robot, it was easy as pie. But I could tell that my breast surgeon was annoyed at having to synch up her schedule with the gyno onco (especially because of the robot). My gyno onco said they have even done three surgeries together if I wanted to do reconstruction (which I did not because I had a lumpectomy) with a plastic surgeon. So I know it can be done. Maybe see if your surgeon has *very specific* reasons s/he doesn't want to do the ooph at the same time? Good luck, Keli",
