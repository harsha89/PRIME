I had no problems at all.  Thanks so much for feedback from everyone - as we say constantly here - everyone is different. - cracker1951",

It will be m 6th week after surgery, I'm currently in my 3rd week. My drs reassured me from the beginning that I should still do this vacation and that I would be ok for traveling. The trip is still on but we are flying instead of driving (2 1/2 hr flight). I'm worried about the trip - I don't want to be so exhausted that I cannot participate & don't want to be in pain/discomfort when flying. Am I being unrealistic to do this, despite what drs said? For those of you who have been 5 & 6 weeks out - what do you think? I'm not planning on swimming, surfing,etc - just being w friends, reading, birdwatching, short walks on the beach.  Wanted to fish but can tell that one is out. What do you think? - Cracker1951 Log in to post a reply",

I'm seeing my surgeon this week and will ask her about the lymphadema thing. I recall that she was not worried about that at all when we discussed that pre-surgery. I, too only had sentinal nodes removed. I'm probably overanxious about this but it will ease that if I have information and a plan. Thanks again - cracker1951",

My BS and PS are not concerned about lymphadema for me on a 3 hr plane flight so have to add that to the mix of things here.  It is really helpful to look at this and focus my concerns when I talk with the doctors.  Will have to make a decision soon. Thanks again - cracker1951",
