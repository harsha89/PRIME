The thing the physios etc forget to tell you is that 2 weeks is still VERY SOON after lymph surgery and not being able to lift your arm much is totally normal I think now. I felt completely crippled ( seroma drained 4 times I think ) couldn't do the exercises they gave me,. Lots of pain. Cording. . All this at your stage. . And then after six weeks, I was back in the pool doing laps. And yes the Cording was still noticeable at full stretch but I could swim. The first few weeks are totally scary but it gets better. Hang in there sister. It was my experience that the physio and the pamphlet they gave me ,didn't distinguish between lymph node surgery and not having it. The latter being much easier on the body. I still after 4 months have some Cording but I only notice it when I do a full stretch, like at the gym. 2 weeks is still very early days. Your body needs rest more than vigorous exercise. . I found after a month I started to make significant progress. Do whatever relaxing things you can for nerve pain like baths? Meditation? Aroma therany? Music? and give yourself time. Hope this helps. It's really scary the Cording at first,I remember that, but all the research I read says it does eventually go away. Best wishes Rachel in New Zealand x x",
