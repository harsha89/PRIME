My history: I had a mastectomy (left breast in April) for an ongoing breast cancer that was originally diagnosed as 90% estrogen receptive and 50% progesterone receptive 4 years ago. I was treated with Arimidex for a year and then switched to Faslodex for another 2 years . It seemed to control the cancer growth, until I had a ruptured appendix last November. After 7 weeks of extensive antibiotic treatment, the breast changed and not in a good way. I decided to finally have it removed. The surgery did not get clean margins (unfortunately) and the tumor removed had changed; it was now 56% estrogen receptive, 0% progesterone receptive, and HER2 amplified (2.2). Before I could start Herceptin treatment, I contracted the flu which quickly turned into what I thought was pneumonia. My left plural lining was completely occluded. I had trouble breathing. I finally had a thoracentesis which showed the fluid contained the same breast cancer cells. I have been receiving Perjeta, Herceptin, and Taxol treatment. I have used the Arctic cold caps at my son's insistence, and have not lost any of my hair which is shoulder length.It is a process that requires a helper to apply and a lot of patience as it must be started 45 minutes before Taxol treatment, and continue for 4 hours after. Your head does get used to the cold. You also cannot do anything but spray leave on conditioner on the hair, wash it in luke warm water no sooner than 3 days before or after treatment, and otherwise not cut or color it. It is just your hair treated very gently. The results are excellent, however, if you have the time and patience to devote to it. It was not that expensive - $362. to rent the entire package per month. I am not familiar with Penguin caps, but Arctic caps do work. Hope that helps. Log in to post a reply",
