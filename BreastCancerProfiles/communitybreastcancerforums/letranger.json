I like the frequent follow-ups and my MO and clinical oncs are communicating so I appreciate the input from both to better treat me. Hopeful, I did not know that there were some out of pocket expenses for some clinical trials. I thought they were funded. Well, I learn something new from you ladies everyday! And yes, thanks again to the Herceptin ladies who particiapted in the early trials!!!",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2015 01:05AM - edited Jul 30, 2015 01:06AM by letranger My case is a little different. I had a bilateral mastectomy, one side was prophylactic. I really wanted to be flat, but let my PS talk me into silicone implants. Well one got infected after 6 months of the exchange so now I only have one implant. I wear a sticky prosthesis, but wish I was flat so I did not have to worry about looking balanced. I have bigger issues than that, but I am self conscious. I am ok with the prosthesis, but don;t wear anything low-cut as one can see it if I bend over. I also wear it swimming. Just have to pick out my clothes more carefully.",
