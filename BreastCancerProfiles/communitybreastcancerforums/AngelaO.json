I'm not very computer savvy either, so I completely understand your confusion. I thought that I'd try to \"talk\" you through the process of entering your information: After you log in, look at the top right of the screen. You'll see \"My Profile\". Click on it and it will pull up a page that has four areas for you to enter information: My Articles, My Diagnosis, My Treatment, and My Personal Information. Click on \"My Diagnosis\" and you'll see a list of questions about when you were first diagnosed, the nature of your diagnosis, etc., There are drop down boxes with choices of answers, as well as fill-in-the-blank responses. If you are not sure about a response, you can just click the choice indicating that you'd prefer not to answer, and it simply leaves that area blank. As you go through the responses, you'll be instructed to \"go to next\", or to \"save and exit.\" After you've finished with the Diagnoses area, move on to Treatment, then to Personal Information. As you've already noticed, the information you entered and saved will be listed under your posts. However, I've seen many posts from ladies who choose not to share their information, so it isn't mandatory - just helpful to others to see your history. I'm headed to bed right now, but will check back on this thread in the morning to see if you have trouble following my not-so-clear instructions! I see that you've already received much good information and suggestions from many of the ladies on this forum. They will be such an incredible support system for you - regardless of your pending test results. Best wishes to you, Angela  ",
