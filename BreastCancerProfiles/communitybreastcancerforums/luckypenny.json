So the surgery pathology is very important and is what you base treatment decisions on.   They only know about the biopsy sample right now which isn't your final staging or grading.  After surgery, you will meet again with surgeon to go over your pathology and then meet with an oncologist to go over treatment.  What are they saying about your biopsy or mri?  How big do they think the tumor is?  Are they concerned about any nodes?  Have they asked you if you want reconstruction?  Alot of women when they have mastectomy, also have reconstruction at the same time.  I had skin sparing during my mastectomy but didn't do reconstruction at the time, but have the option of doing it later .  My surgeon had no problem doing skin sparing.  Actually , I have decided I don't want reconstruction and would like the extra skin removed, and she said she can do that if I want.  I understand this is all so new and frightening.  I think it would help to sit down with your surgeon again and ask them the questions.  A good surgeon should take the time to answer these and also you need to ask for what you want to be sure the surgeon is a good fit .",

I so remember the beginning of my dx and reading and questioning everything. I love my onc and he is really on top of things but I have to feel in control and knowledge is power. He respects my reading and research and my asking questions. Ultimately I want to know that I have done everything I could to beat this thing. Ultimately, over time my trust in the process and my providers deepens. but I have to be an active part of that process or it won't work for me. And guess what ....my dr doesn't think i am off my rocker Don't let anyone dissuade you from asking questions here or of your dr. Or providers. Many women get multiple opinions before they feel satisfied with a treatment plan. You have the luxury to do this",

You said that you or possibly your docs or pathologist had a 6 cm tumor but that your area of involvement included dcis. So for your tumor size only the invasive part was counted as tumor. Do I understand that right? If that is the case, I had a 9 cm area of involvement. I have IDC but 30% of that area of involvement was dcis. If I go by what you have been told then my ' size' was 6.3 cm. Am I thinking of this right? Is that how your doc or path calculated yours? If so then I am better off. I always wondered how have 30% dcis in my idc played into things.",
