Maybe because it is a government facility or it is because im not a kuwaiti. I am really scared and no one is trying to explain to me whats on my US mammogram. They dont even ask any history of disease or even just ask me if i have family relatives who had breast or even ovarian cancer. I had gone thru two clinics and two hospitals already. I just want to go home instead. Log in to post a reply",

I went to a gynecologist and said that she did not find any lump but still she request ultrasound mammogram. There are three lesions in my left breast and one cyst on the right breast. I had picture of the result of the mammogram. I will try to check if they can send me one also.. Thank you",
