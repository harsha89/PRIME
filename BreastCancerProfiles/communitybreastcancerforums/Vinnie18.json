Letrozole stopped working after one year, hormone blocker was changed to Tamoxifen which helped for under a year now the recommendation is Zeloda or a hormone treatment which is given via injection. Can anyone with liver mets also let me know what your physical symptoms are? At the second diagnosis I had multiple lesions on both lobes with sizable tumours on both lobes as well. Following a Tamoxifen and cannabis oil regime all multiple lesions were gone with only a few tumours. Six months later there was progression. I started last year with severe cramps, I have shortness of breath but my liver function and inflammation markers are fantastic. My physician (not onco) says that Essential Extreme tablets are the best on the market. I am not keen to try any further chemotherapy. As I understand it, the time of NED the first time round doing chemotherapy is a very good indicator of how the second would go so I don't see the point as I was NED for 7 months. My tumour markers are as follows: 06.05.2016 - 52,20 29.09.2016 - 61.60 18.10.2016 - 88,00 15.12.2016 - 197.40 17.01.2017 - 171,00 16.02.2017 - 185.00 What to do? Anyone else feel so lost?

CO failed twice as I was on it throughout chemo in 2014 up until recurrence seven months later. I went off it and then tried it again but tumour markers were going sky high.
