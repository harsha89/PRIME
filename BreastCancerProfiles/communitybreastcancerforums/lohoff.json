It's like glass. You can see right through it to my scalp. It is definitely growing super slowly. I'm still not comfortable going without my chemo cap in public yet, but I am completely topless at home. Before BC, my hair was dark brown with a lot of white. As soon as it grows a little longer, I'm ditching the caps for good!",

I have learned that healing from cancer treatment is definitely a slow process, so I'm just taking it month by month. Joining the Livestrong program at my local Y was an awesome experience. I highly recommend it. I could barely walk up my steps each day and now I can run up them. I feel better today than I have in many years. Hugs and prayers to all of you!

The class is two days a week. I was so worn out though, and all we did were assessments. 😆 I am the youngest (at 56 lol) and the only one in the class still in treatment. I'm planning on beating this fatigue. I still do everything I did before my diagnosis and while on chemo. It just takes me a little longer. Three days after my lumpectomy, I hosted my family - 45 people - for Xmas Eve, Xmas day and then on New Year's Day. There is something healing for me about not acting sick and doing the things I always do. I also try to ride my bike 🚴🏻♀️ for a half hour when the weather permits, which in NE Ohio is about two days per week 😀 I am so encouraged by the thoughts and experiences of everyone on this forum!
