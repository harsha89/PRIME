I was planning to have a double mastectomy in the next couple months, but I find myself stalling the process. My mom died from Breast Cancer when i was 19 and I have two little girls (3y & 8mo.). I am still breast feeding and am not wanting to stop even though my plan was to stop after 6 mo. Once I stop BF I have to wait 6 weeks before I can have surgery. im not sure I am done having kids but feel a pressure to have the surgery sooner than later. As a mother, what is your opinion? Thanks so much",

I am still breast feeding my 8 mo old and feel I should stop to prepare for double mastectomy. I wish someone could tell me how much time I have. I cannot decide to do surgery until I know which reconstruction method would be best for me. I did not like the paid surgeon I saw over a year ago,  so I am finding a new one.  I am really overweight now, (5'5'' 280 lb) especially since having child #2. With the postpartum and the surgery looming over me it is really difficult to diet and exercise. I am not sure if i should put off surgery (at least a year) to hope to lose weight. Has anyone undergone this type of surgery while overweight? What would be the best reconstruction method? Would DIEP be possible? What about the stretch marks? Obviosly it would be nice to get a bit of fat removed from my tummy if I have to go through this. ?..?.  Thank u Log in to post a reply",
