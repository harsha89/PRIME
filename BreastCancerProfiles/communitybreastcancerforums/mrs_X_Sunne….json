I guess the point of all my rambling is that I SO know how you feel, and it SUCKS!!!!  p.s.Janice you look FABULOUS in your wig.  I notice in all of my wig on pictures that my hair has that shiny barbie doll synthetic look.  Oh well. ",

I did the weekly Taxol, but the combo with herceptin and zometa just made a mess of my stomach.  I had horrible diarrhea for about 3 days after treatment each week.  I am a piano teacher, so the neuropathy I had in my fingers made it difficult to play and teach piano lessons.   I will have to check out that alternative to taxol- abraxane.  I too hate the dexemethazone.  It makes me so jittery and agitated, and can't sleep and I swell up, so I look like a bald fat man.  I posted some before and after pictures on my blog. I have been on Aromasin, but my doctor doesn't think that changing hormonals will make that much of a difference quickly enough.  I asked about radiation, but I have way too many bone mets for that to be effective.  They want to save that for if I am in imminent danger of a bone breaking.  He is quite adamant about not changing treatment drugs from Taxol because we quit that while it was still working, so he strongly believes that I still have some mileage left out of that, and he doesn't want to burn through treatments too quickly.  I have a lot of years to live!!!!!!  I will have my tumor markers ran again in 2 weeks.  If they do another large jump doubling again, then we won't delay the start of Taxol.  However if they only rise a small to moderate amount, we will delay another 3 weeks until August 19th.  We have a family trip planned August 6-12 so I would really want to wait until after that.  My kids go back to school on August 25th.  3 will go all day, and then I will have my kindergartner go half day, and have my 2 year old home with me all day.  I will be able to rest and handle the side effects a lot better once the kids are back in school.  We will just have to cram a whole lot of fun into the next month!!!  We already went to Yellowstone national Park for a week, and that was so beautiful and relaxing.  We plan to go swimming lots, and to the Zoo and the park, and school clothes shopping, and all that other fun stuff.   ",

I was pretty drugged up for a while. I got my drains out today, what a relief that was. I have fluid in my lungs and have been coughing quite a bit, which is really painful on the incisions from the hysterectomy.

I recently did gamma knife for a single brain met.  It sounds like with 3 (I think you said) brain lesions you would be a candidate for gamma knife instead of whole brain radiation.  Gamma knife is a single high dose radaition treatment, and I am glad that I was able to do it, even though it was indeed a traumatic, painful experience.  The actual radiation was fine, it was getting the head frame placed that was painful, and the 4 spots where they screwed it into my head are still a little tender a month later.   I know what you mean about how disappointing it is to loose your hair again.  I too had a cute curly short hair do, and it was a lot more difficult to loose my hair the second time.  I did go buy 3 new cute wigs, that I actually like more than my out of control curls.  they are a lot easier to tame, however they are a little more uncomfortable than having my own hair.   I wish you all the best in your treatment decisions.  It is difficult to learn of brain mets, but it seems like we get used to the bad news, and just keep on keeping on.  It does help to have responsibilites and things to do.  What is the point of being here if we don't still enjoy things, or live life, right!  Best wishes, Amber ",

Therefore, I DID NOT chose to die.  Choosing to have treatments does not mean choosing to live.   I am sorry that you are feeling the frustration as you feel like you are a burden to your family, I feel like that every single day.  I just hope that you can find some peace, and that you will have strength to do what is best for you.  I will pray for you. love, Amber ",

Because I was a breastfeeding mother, my ob-gyn kept on telling me it was mastitis, engorgement, clogged milk ducts etc.   I thank God every day that I found this site and was able to read about this terribe disease, otherwise I probably wouldn't be alive right now to type this.   I hope that it does turn out to be nothing, but you do need to be agressive and find out what exactly is causing her problem.   ",

I too would love to stick them with the needle for once...... ",

They are not sure if it is cancer, and the area where they are is too risky to biopsy.  My tumor markers have also continued to rise.  It seems like the chemo isn't doing much. I have decided to take a month off from chemo, get feeling better again, and try to get my strength up again.  My husband is taking me to St. Martin, and island in the Caribbean in 2 weeks.  We will spend a week together at a beach front condo.  I can't wait to spend some alone time with my love, and can't wait for the warm sunny beaches, and floating in warm water.  That is the best pain relief!!!  ",

Well, turns out, it really was that expensive.  I will be on Herceptin the rest of my life.  Each week with my visit to the onc. and treatment is $1200, and I have to pay 30% of it.  Luckily our insurance covers at 100% after you pay $5,000 out of pocket.  It starts over every year.  I am grateful to have the coverage, but it sure stinks to have to pay that much money..... ",

I am doing great and am off my pain meds!  Yippeee!!!  It is so good to not have pain, only a little.  I had my first weekly herceptin treatment without the taxol today.  I also had zometa.  It is great to not be feeling nauseated or have my hands and feet burning from the taxol.  I was so tired of that. I received my pathology report today also.  There were a couple of spots of cancer left in the breast, so my onc and surgeon are both still recommending 6 weeks of radiation to prevent recurrence on the chest wall.  I was really hoping to get out of radiation.  At least they told me I could wait a couple of months to recover from my dual surgery.   I also have to start taking Aromasin today.  Anyone else taking this??  Have many side effects?

Just popping in to say hello.  I can't believe how many posts and views there are on this thread!  140 pages!!!!!!  WOW!!!!! I am doing well.  I finished radiation a month ago, that was tedious. I hated going to the hospital every day, and it was so painful to my back and hip to lay on that hard table.   I go in every three weeks to receive herceptin now, and hopefully that will keep me stable for a long time.  I also take Aromasin, and I hate it.  I am achy like an old woman, and the hot flashes are so annoying.  Better that than dead, though!!!  ;) It is so cold here, I am ready for spring!   Take care everyone!  I will try to check in with you all a little more often. ",

Staying busy for the weekend seems smart.  Try to keep your mind off things.   I think once you can have your surgery, you can start the healing and moving on.  I was so relieved when I started treatment so I could feel like I was doing SOMETHING to get rid on the terrible thing inside of me.  ",

You are amazing that you went to work..... That is wonderful.  Make sure you get the rest you need, though!!!!!  Have a good night! ",

Hope you can go back to sleep!!!! ",

I am so glad to read your posts and know that there are others out there that have the EXACT same feelings as me. I had a hard time yesterday mourning the disfigurement of my body. My tummy is so bloated from the hysterectomy, and I am bruised everywhere from the mast and hyst, and I just BAWLED. I hate not having hair...I wonder if I will ever look halfway normal again. It is so good to know that others have the same feelings and mourn the way I do. Some days, it is easy to be positive, but then there are days when all I can think about is how much having cancer SUCKS!! It is hard to be hopeful sometimes. I am so glad we have each other to help one another through this difficult trial that life has dealt us. I loved everyones pictures!!! I will have to post some pics once I feel a little better. I hope everyone has a good weekend! Hugs to everyone! Amber ... Sunneedazee",
