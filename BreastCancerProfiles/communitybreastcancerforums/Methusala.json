I do have my expander it (and dam*) it HURTS... but I'm glad I had it done now, because the way she talked, you can NOT have an expander put in AFTER radiation. is this true?? does radiation hurt your skin THAT much? also, the sentinel node was positive, so they took out ALL my lymph nodes.. they said there were 38 of them... and ALL 38 tested NEGATIVE!!!! yahooooooooooo!!!!! but my arm hurts so much were they cut under there It hurts no matter how much pain meds I take!

The dr. gave me some strong pain pills to fight off the neulasta pain, plus a script for lomotil for diarrhea.  No more emend or steroids either.   Like Spongebob says: \"i'm ready, i'm ready, i'm ready\" oh, found out today I am: neg, neg, neg!! (for hormone thingys) I am grade 2, and stage 2b.  I finally saw my path. report from August. ",

LOL I guess I do look like a leper, I guess I'd stare at me too now that I think about it...   well, I'm kind of rambling, but I haven't been back here in weeks, and trying to read all the posts.   My lap top was also in the shop for 3 weeks, I got it back and it's worse than when I sent it in, so now it's gone back.   Anyway.. ta ta for now, I tired myself out writing all this!! ",

That's the ONE thing I've really complained about through all of this.  Seriously.  I find kids staring at me all the time, but I've found a big smile usually gets a big smile back.  Honestly, I can't stand other peoples kids (mine are perfect ya know) but seriously, if you smile at them, especially like 7 or 8 year old girls, you will get a big smile of relief back.   As for adults, screw them all.  In APplebee's last Friday an old man was staring at me and I stared right back, I kid you not ladies, after the THIRD time I stared this man down, he did NOT look back, he actually turned his back to me in his booth.  If the old fart is going down memory lane, then he needs to come up and introduce himself and tell me his story, I can handle that these days, but don't stare at me out of your own insecurities and ignorance.  I have enough crap to deal with in my every day life. One thing I love about Roswell, I can walk around bald, and almost NOONE looks at me.  I love it. (except the new people in the lobby, and I think I just give them a good scare. <eg> ",

Hubby found a lump in my right breast about ten days ago, on a Tuesday. On Thurs. I went to my GP, and he sent me home with antibiotics and said it was a cyst, and told me not to worry about it. He'd see how it was in two weeks. By Sunday night I was a wreck, so Monday AM I called my nurse Midwife (no I'm not pregnant, I see her for my 'female' stuff). They got me right in Monday afternoon. She was really concerned, as SHE found another lump (my dr. missed it) and sent me up to Buffalo to a breast clinic. At the clinic I had 3 very painful Mammograms, one ultrasound, and an excruciating biopsy. The dr. there told me \"It doesn't look good\". She said, \"we'll treat this aggressively\" and \"You will still need an MRI\". They said the results from the biopsy would be in Fri., no later than Monday. As of Friday, they results were not back. So, I'm sitting here.. near hysterical again.. LOL it comes in waves, sometimes I'm fine, other times, I'm in a panic I can't get out of. I had a sister die of breast cancer when she was 38. I am 37!!! I had never had a mammogram before. WOW did it hurt when the smooshed the tumor on top. whenever I roll over or bend over, I about scream in pain. It took 3 lortabs to get the throbbing in my breast to stop tonight. IT HURTS! I have no indents, drainage, or anything like that. The top tumore is one inch around they told me, and it HURTS! yikes! anyway, that's my story. Long enough to bore everyone I'm sure. I'm here looking for support, and reading posts to see what's going on with others. I don't know anyone who has or had b. cancer. I never knew my sister that died. My father also died of cancer, as did his brother and everyone on that side of the family. Thanks folks for letting me rant. I do have some questions.. like \"WHAT NEXT\" and \"How do I stay CALM\"... and \"can I kick my dr. that sent me home with antibiotics?? I am so angry at him I could scream!! How could he just blow this off?? How could he miss such a serious medical issue?\" I HATE HIM right now for not taking this seriously. If I had listened to HIM, I'd still be in the dark, taking unnecessary drugs, and not even seeing him again until THIS Thursday! JERK!! I'm so glad I followed my heart and called my Nurse Midwife.. she's the greatest. so.. what now?? thanks everyone. I didn't realize how badly I needed to unload. oh.. what about my teenage daughter? I've told her everything... is there a support group for her? and my hubby is THE GREATEST. BRCA 1 + and the BIG 3, triple negative.. Life is short. Pray hard with your kids.

I haven't posted much on here, or my blog, but my life has been a whirlwind.  I haven't even thanked my chemo angels for all their kindness...  I can't wait til this nightmare is over and I have the time and mental status to be one!! Well ladies, it's Thursday morning...  and Th. are the most hectic for me.  So what do I do? sit here LOL LOL I have a 'tech' in my rad office that I do not like.  I think she senses I do NOT like her.  She rubs me the wrong way.  She's like all of 23?  5'2\", cropped plantinum hair.. and just.. well.. just.. ye gads... if she says one more condescending remark to me, I'm going to have to slap her one with the stupid stick!  all the other girls are very quiet, look you in the eye, compassionate... this one tho'.. she thinks she's all that and a bag of chips, ya know??   *sigh*  is it just me??  tell me ladies, do I need to \"man up\" LOL and forget it?  Maybe I'm just directing my anger at her... I'm so darn tired of this cancer running my life.. telling me where I have to be and when, surgery, radiation, chemo, appointments...  drugs, co-pays...   I WANT MY LIFE BACK!!! and I want it back NOWWWWW!!! hm.. well. heh he heh... Did I mention I haven't taken my xanax today? LOL happy Thursday. ",

I burn.. burn.. burn... sigh. They gave me a sample cream, anyone hear of it?  it's war zone or something weird like that.  They say it's being used by the troops in Iraq. It's 100% herbs/natural.  It' smells pretty coool.  I wasn't amazed by it's use, but whatever.  I posted a picture of my blisters on my blog .. my sister told me my armpit was gross.  LOL  I wan't offended.  it's MY blog and I'll post whatever I want. ",

On a crappy note, the Post Office is trying to sue my husband for the family leave he took for me last Fall during chemo.  Can you say amen sister.. he's worked for them for nearly 30 years, and this is the slap in the face he gets.  They approved it last Fall, he has the letter to prove it, but they say he should have known better, and has to pay back 12K of it.  OMG.  Life's a beach around here.  Then our income tax refund was $1,200 LESS than we thought, cause I defaulted on a student loan.  I just can't win.

I would really wonder if I had a dr. tell me there would be no lung damage, etc. not trying to freak anyone out here, but it just seems to me that ANY amount of radiation is harmful to some extent.  You just have to weigh your pros and cons. Both drs. also agree absolutely no deodorant except the second dr. gave me free sample of deodarant ( A BIG SIZED one too, that will last!) and they gave me a full bag of aquaphor, said to use it all over, my hands were/are really dry and the nurse said almost all the chemo patients they see have 'chemo skin' and that this aquaphor would work anywhere.  My hands are terribly dry, I just thought it was old man winter etc. They did tell me no perfumes, but that was because they get some really sick people in there and smells can really bother them more than usual. (Fine with me, my own dr.'s secretary had a candle burning IN THE OFFICE! that made me nauseated!!) no bubble baths, etc. as it could really irritate the skin, unscented ivory soap was all they approved of during radiation. well, I've typed enough.  I'm escaping reality right now.  My 16 yo dd was majorlly rude to a friend of mine today so I turned her internet off, and she went behind me and turned it back on. *sigh*  She's lucky ALL I did was yell at her ( I never yell at my kids... trust me I'm a calm person) and for the first time all I wanted to do was smack that rude mouth of hers. too many appointments, too many pills, too much pain, hot flashes, and I feel like my period wants to rush forth and greet me with a big hello, but since I'm in forced menopause, it's going to just be crampy forever... and then that mouth.. I was embarrassed for both of us!  hm.. I hear voices... yes... voices... they are calling me... yes....I'm sure now, the fridge is yelling to me to let the Zinfandel out...  hm.. guess I better go see what's going on... I think that zinfandel NEEDS me right now... ",
