Love your wind, and love the knowledge shared on these boards.  I guess my fear stems from the nurses questioning the fact that I have no port.  I did have a total mastectomy, 4 nodes from 1 side& and 5 from the other.  I would certainly prefer to continue using my veins, but scared to have something else go wrong through this proceedure.  I'll speak to my ONC about it.",

Thanks again. Deb",
