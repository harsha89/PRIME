Its taken my whole summer but I want each of you to know you can get thru it.  I had alot of pink skin, a couple blisters etc. but I made it and praise the Lord I did. I am encouraging all of you it will be over soon.   This has been a great place to learn about what I was going thru , because none of my friends or family have ever had BC and Ive had no one to talk to about it.  This is a very good site to make new friends and we all have the same feelings and fears about what has just popped into our lives.  God Bless Each and Every One of You! I hope you make it thru as easy as I did.",

It will be over soon.  I finished on Aug 20th so its been a couple weeks. Im actually more tired now than I was while doing rads. My skin is slowing returning to normal. I have had lots of peeling. The huge square tan that I got from reg. rads is disappearing and the pink-redness has lightened so much from the boosts  after two weeks of  no radiation and the swelling has gone down tremendously to almost normal.  Please have faith that you will get thru it. I did.  Love you all.  PS. I am also suffering from sinus infection too. Made the whole weekend miserable.",

      "Content": "Sep 8, 2009 12:22PM - edited Sep 8, 2009 12:24PM by KRMC That is what they told me to about the Xray to make sure they were still on target.  Didnt have them with the boosts but that is such a smaller area.  I also thought to make sure they werent hitting your lungs and I was thinking my heart also(right breast for me)  Its really funny because in the beginning they draw their lines and tatoo you and then in several weeks your tan line is exactly in those line areas.Then you move on to the boosts and they draw their lines and again you are radiated right in their lines so it has to be pretty accurate.",
