I had my first chemo treatment last Thursday, it will be for 16 weeks, every other week now.  Then 6-8 weeks of radiation (5 days/week) and then take Tamoxifen after that.  What I am just finding out is how fatigued you are afterwards.  My chemo was 1 week ago and it is a week later, and I still can hardly get out of bed, except to get some food or go to the bathroom.  I left the house only once this week to get some groceries and it wiped me out.  I have fibromyalgia, and since chemo started, it has increased what was very manageable for the past 10 years.  So, I am sore in the muscles and laying in bed is uncomfortable.   Lack of sleep increases the fatigue as you can imagine.  I will be so glad when this is over, at least the radiation won't be so severe as this.  What are you symptoms, are you handling the chemo OK?  Hopefully, it gets better as we get \"used\" to it.",

As you know, Tamoxifen is to block estrogen so it will also produce menopausal symptoms. What a road we have to travel, but once this is over, life will be great.....it already is! :>)  Have a great day!",
