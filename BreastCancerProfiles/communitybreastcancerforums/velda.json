They are suppose to call within the next 2 weeks to give me an appointment with the oncologist. I don't mine waiting. Yesterday's appointment was a second opinion. The original doctor wanted to just redo the mamogram in 6 months even with my past history. I'm sure once I do see the oncologist he will agree with a biopsy. I won't settle for anything less.",

      "Content": "velda wrote: History: Routine screening of right breast. Left breast cancer in 1992 with mastectomy. Craniocaudal, mediolateral and mediolateral oblique screening mammography of the right breast performed. Examination demonstrates a benign-appearing oil type cyst measuring 6mm in the 2:00 retroareolar portion of the right breast. Multiple small lymph nodes are seen in the right axilla and upper outer quadrant of right breast. I do not identify any suspicious dominant mass lesions or microcalicifications. Mamogram negative for malignancy. Now this would all be well and good except when I did have breast cancer with lymph node involvement they didn't think it was cancer then either. It ended up being atypical medullary carcinoma with multiple foci. I guess my biggest question is, what is the retroareolar portion of the right breast? I saw a nurse practioner yesterday and she has put in a consult for an oncologist to see me but it will be another 4 to 6 weeks before I will actually see him. And doesn't a mamogram normally show some of the lymph nodes anyway? Any responses would be appreciated. Log in to post a reply",

He had a heart attack in February with pnumonia and then went into kidney failure. He is now on dialysis. While he was in the hospital recovering they found a mass in his thyroid glands. They told us they were 98% sure it is cancer. But because of his recent heart attack they can't go in to do a biopsy until July at the earliest. They don't think he would survive the anesthisia (sp?). So the waiting for him to find out what type of thyroid cancer he has and if mine could be BP I'm about at the end of my tether. The waiting is truly the hardest part. Once you know, you adjust and cope the best you can. The mental anguish is at times almost unbearable. I keep telling myself God never puts more on your plate then you can handle. But boy oh boy.",
