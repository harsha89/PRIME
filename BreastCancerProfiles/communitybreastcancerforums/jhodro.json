I have to fill out a pain/condition survey once a week as well to see how things are progressing in addition to those first appt pics. They'll take another set of pictures at the end as well. I've completed 10 of 33 as of today. I feel like it's slow progress, but progress all the same. As far as side effects go, I was swollen and 'heavy' after the first few treatments. As of today, I'm pretty visibly pink. I have super pale skin, so it's pretty visible. I also have some tightness in my scar from the part of the lumpectomy where they removed the lymph nodes under my arm. I did PT a while back so I am trying to remember to do the stretches so it doesn't get worse. The only thing I've used is the gel thing that a nurse gave me that is stored in the fridge and helps to alleviate the nipple tenderness. It's effective, but can only be worn for 4 hours. Otherwise, I've kept it dry, only used unscented dove soap, drinking as much water as I can and eating lots of protein.  Good luck to everyone starting out. Hoping for no SEs for everyone!!!",

I held up fairly well - do have some pain, itching, redness etc. but the aquaphor, hydrogel and for the itching the cortisone cream all do help. Now my underarm can begin to heal, the incision there is very tender and the area is pretty red. The fatigue has really gotten to me the last couple of days, more than ever. But, there is light at the end of the tunnel. After 10/8, I'll just have the every three week Herceptin until April. Mmtagirl: best of luck on your decision. It's almost easier if you're not given a choice, somehow. Peggy: I'm also pretty much going without deodorant. Someone told me along the way that the rads would eliminate whatever it is that makes you sweat there and cause odor, but that has not happened for me. On the other hand, there is much less hair growth there than on the other side, I guess that is a plus? I just use wipes when I'm going to be out for a while so I don't smell too bad. It hasn't been as bad as I initially expected. The entire area under rads is numb for me, although the skin still itches at this point, so I just used cortisone and put the aquaphor over the top of that to keep it from drying out.  Hope you're all hanging in there!!",

Not wearing deodorant on my right side was sometimes frustrating, but I'm done!! Tomorrow, I plan to sleep as late as possible, but still get my son to school at 9. :) Hopefully in the next week or two I'll get some energy back and my skin will get back to resembling something like normal.  Now all I have is every 3 week Herceptin through until April and a most likely surgery to get some symmetry going on. Thanks to everyone for your posts - it has been a great inspiration knowing that I'm not on my own through all of this. Good luck & you can do it!!!",

I am one full week since rads (yahoo!!). I have been very frustrated this week though since the fatigue is still seriously kicking my butt. Today I dragged myself to walk with the dog - this is something that I used to do daily even through most of chemo for about 3 miles, but I could only go a very short distance...Luckily I had my BS follow-up appointment today. He was really helpful and explained/reminded me how many things we've all been through, surgery(ies), chemo, then rads...so it takes much longer than we all expect to feel back to normal. Honestly, even though I was tired, I figured I'd bounce back in a week or two. He said expect to have more energy by my next 3 month check up and be back 100% at 6 months. Not that I want to wait that long, but it does make sense, as I was starting to wonder if something was wrong with me.  So if anyone else is feeling this way, you're not alone! I also have a consult scheduled for my next phase, symmetry, PS. It probably won't be until after I finish Herceptin in spring, but at least I can feel like I'm getting it all scheduled and then I'll finally be able to move on. :) Take care, everyone!!",

I am a DD on the left and a C+ on the right since surgery, so it's made the right bra next to impossible to find. I can't really go free, although when I'm home I do use a cotton cami and then I use the cut-up t-shirt under my arm where that seam is. I do feel like my scars and my nipple are extremely sensitive already (for example, accidentally brushed the towel against those areas and it's not pleasant) although my skin doesn't look any different. I started on Tues last week (8/19) but the machine broke down Friday, so I picked up number four this morning.

I had my first bloodwork drawn this week, I'm on the low side which accounts for my nagging desire to nap every afternoon around 2 or 3. Today, the computer went down mid-treatment, fortunately for me they were able to bring it back up and finish mine, but unfortunately for the ladies after me, they had to wait for someone to come and see what was going on. Something about the water that's used for cooling the machine. :( But, happy Friday. I hope everyone is feeling decent and get some r&r this weekend.  Peggy, I wish it was easier for you too. My MIL has Parkinson's, but she is a wee little thing, barely weighs 90 pounds at this point so my FIL can help her around easily; and they are in Canada, so she is able to have a nurse come 4 times a week and they also have a benefit that allows a cleaning person to come once a week. It's a really rough disease (I guess they all are, though really). Best of luck to you. ",

When they are underwire free, they are like vests that just smush you down and together. It makes me look like I have a ton of cleavage all the time which the underwires don't do that. I think we should still have decent supportive options that don't look like a vest from the 50's. I also haven't found a sports bra that I can get on (hooks in the back) and is supportive enough for running/intense exercise (I haven't started that yet, but plan to soon). I am also planning a reduction on the left in a year or so once all this is over. The symmetry will help me find more bra options, I think, too. Onelump: I got 5 tattoos, only one on the breast bone, two on each side. I'm thinking I'll have that one in the front blasted off next year sometime, but the ones on the sides, I'd never see and they are super tiny. Hope you all have a great Tuesday.

I have a pretty red thing going on especially in the armpit and the scar from the lymph node removal and my lumpectomy scar are pretty tender. I am using hydrogel once a day during my busier time of the day and Aquaphor. I noticed this week too that the skin looks 'pixelated' and the RO said that anything on your skin (like old stretch marks I have from nursing) will be more visible but he said it all goes away a month or two after rads are finished. As far as working - I had an interview Tuesday. It was very difficult, because my brain still cannot recall things like it used to. So trying to describe things in detail - it was very frustrating. I think it went ok, but I still feel like I have lost a lot. I hope it all comes back. Not sure how it will, but I'm hopeful. I'm 8 weeks PFC - you'd think that the brain stuff would be better. Maybe it just takes practice.

I'm going to call tomorrow and see about a stronger sleep med or stopping the steroid. But, I seem to be very sensitive to steroids and have taken them for a sinus infection in the past and had a bad reaction. It's also causing raging acne that I really don't know what to do about either. The MO suggestion of cortisone has not helped at all. The acne is crazy on my head as well, which makes wearing anything on my head, especially a wig, very uncomfortable. Hopefully after sleep tonight I will be in a much better space about this. :)",

I plan to take them with me one time to the infusion center when they are out of school, just so they can see what that is all about.

Footballnut - congrats on the Rangers last night! My hubs is from Montreal, so he was pretty upset. :) I do get dry mouth quite a bit on taxol too, I chew a lot of mint gum too. I'm not sure that helps but it masks the taste somewhat. Boobieprize - you look fantastic! Glad you had a good time at lgfb!! Mscaruso - sh**show reflects perfectly what all this is. Bleh.

For me, and I may have said this earlier, I did the surgeries ok. I was just matter-of-fact, but then the day I wig shopped pre-hair loss, I lost it. Then, my MO said, oh, with taxol, you probably won't lose your hair. Then I did in week 4. Then I spent the week losing it again. And got a buzz and felt better. But going in public, it's such a struggle. I hate when complete strangers approach you - and I have had this a few times - to ask - do you have cancer. Or at the elementary where my son goes - now everyone has to know and people are all curious. People have asked what my chances are. People have told me their cancer relative horror stories. And like you guys, people compliment my hair or hat, depending on what I feel like wearing - I know they mean well, but there is pity. Maybe it's that they see us as too close to them, and it hits home that it can happen to anyone and they are afraid. Who knows. I just don't want that to be my only conversation, and especially not with people who are so clueless most of the time (not people that are close to me, these are casual acquaintances, mostly). I still am the same person with thoughts about issues and interests. When you have cancer - that's all the public seems to see. It's very disturbing, and, I feel terrible for kids who have to endure the public interest.  On the positive side, going for H only today. My break week - gonna try to really enjoy it!! :) Happy Tuesday!!",

I got my results right away when I was called back in. I didn't get a sure diagnosis until the biopsy, but the mammo/ultrasound results they read and relayed them right there that day. I hope you actually get them much, much sooner. The waiting, in all of the stuff we've been through, is positively one of the most horrible things. Good luck. I'm sure everything will be ok.  Timbuktu: Glad you found the pill!! I am still operating on half a brain. My husband asked me the other day for the English word for 'compass' - he couldn't think of it, it took me about 30 minutes to figure it out. I only speak English. LOL.",

I figured I'd go the route with no regrets - meaning I'd do the Taxol, then I'd have done everything possible to avoid recurrence. Best of luck in the decision.

I also have weekly blood draws. Because my chemo day is Tuesday, originally the infusion center wanted my blood draws on Saturdays. I'm fortunate to be very close to the center, but Saturdays I usually had to sit with the crowd that was waiting for the Urgent Care (Same area) and had to wait as long as 90 minutes. I complained finally and they said, oh you can go on Friday - when they use my \"fast pass\" and I'm in and out in 15 minutes and I don't sit with the crowd in general waiting!! Why they didn't tell me that first, I have no idea. I also am starting to get some track looking marks and bruising on my arm from the blood draws, but was told the techs could not use the port, I'd have to wait for an RN to come down to do it through the port. I'll just keep using the arm as long as possible, I think. It usually isn't too painful as long as you get a decent tech. :) Amazing how that can vary!!",

I've been reading the posts and my thoughts and prayers go out to everyone for quick bouncing back from any side effects, along with full happy and healthy lives!!  I just completed my third treatment of Taxol today. I will have 9 more, 3 weeks on and 1 week off. So next week is my chemo rest week. I'm also getting Herceptin weekly, but no break from that one next week, and will have it for a year. I too have a port and am very glad I do. I had the port surgery two weeks ago, Monday. It's really pretty pain-free when you use the lidocaine cream. I've found that my side effects are pretty varied day-to-day. It's been nothing horrific, more annoying, I think. I'm going to list what I've experienced here, if it can help anyone who's behind me. I think the anxiety of what might be is so much worse than what actually has happened, at least so far for me. The major effect for me has been the fatigue for sure. The day of treatment, I usually just come home and nap for a couple hours. Then I'm usually functional. I haven't slept well the night of treatment, but did take a Tylenol PM (one is better, after taking two the first round was way too much the next day I had a hard time functioning). The metallic taste was definitely the worst for me the first week. That has subsided a bit. Unfortunately, though, food just doesn't taste the same. The only thing that appeals to me is salty, so I have to be careful not to overdo the salt! I also just want a lot of soft breads and cheeses. I have managed to walk the dog most days - I was in pretty good shape before all this started, so I'm trying to get back through a lot of walking. I have to vary the routine, as some days I can do 20 minutes but a few days after treatment, I'm back to a 45 mile fast-ish walk. The steroids have caused some acne (on my face, chest mostly) a couple days after treatment and I also have a lot of sores on my head - which fortunately for me is still covered with the shorter haircut I got week one. Brushing my hair is uncomfortable, but I'm really thankful to still have it, I do have a wig back up plan if I end up needing it. I also have some 'flushing' the morning after treatment, it feels a lot like a sunburn from the inside out, but it comes and goes and is not really disrupting anything, just a feeling. Finally, I have some water retention for a day or two (I have been drinking a ton of water), but that is usually gone a few days after treatment.  I get my infusions on Tuesday mornings, and I've found that by Friday, I can deal with a short cat nap in the afternoon and I'm in pretty good shape. Before all this, I was in a Masters Program, worked full-time and have three kids 7-17 and husband, so I had a lot going on. I decided to take a leave for work for the first few weeks to make sure I could continue my program, which is scheduled to end June 26. I think working would have been do-able for me, but I wouldn't be able to do that, kids and school, so I'm able to take some time off, fortunately. Plus my brain is not at full speed, so work will be a challenge when I do go back. Haven't decided on a date yet, but will have to soon. Hope this is helpful to someone! Best of luck everyone!!",

I have never worn a makeup that is darker than the first shade - for any company - my skin is practically transparent. I'll count that experience as \"it's the thought that counts\".",

I wanted to use my usual running hat, it's much cooler than any of the other hats with more coverage.  Happy mom's day to all you moms out there and hope everyone is enjoying the weekend SE free (as much as possible!!) Oh - and on the LGFB - if you want to meet some local people that are dealing with all this, that is a great place for that. Just as a reminder that there are other people going through the same issues as we talk about here. Have any of you gone to any of the group/sharing meetings - I hesitate to call them support groups - but I guess that's what it is? I have available next Monday, so I'm considering it, but it's two hours. And Monday is my last 'feel decent' day before my weekly infusion Tuesday.

DDKath70: Adding on to what Footballnut said above, I think the feelings you mention are felt by all of us at one time or another. I recommend taking it day by day. Some are better than others, for sure. This group has helped me a ton. I really feel so less alone by hearing about everyone's experiences.  I didn't share my diagnosis with the broader friends and family group, until the night before my first surgery, which was a couple months in. I didn't want to burden anyone or get the stupid questions. But I finally shared that night and it actually encouraged many of my friends and family to get checkups which they wouldn't have done otherwise, I think. And people have been remarkably encouraging, for the most part. So I'm glad I shared. I don't share a ton on Facebook, but when I do I keep it light. I'm sure most cannot understand like this group can. I am also journaling, which I plan to launch in a blog some day (my background is as a copywriter so it feels like the right thing to do).  Here's one of my posts, if you need a chuckle: Here are the top 10 benefits of a hair free lifestyle: 10. People confuse me for Sinead O'Connor from back in the day 9. My 7 y/o thinks I look like a pirate with the cap-scarf 8. Getting-ready time slashed to about 15 minutes from start to finish 7. More space on the bathroom counter 6. Save big on hair cuts and color 5. No more styling dilemmas 4. Temporarily save the environment from all those products' plastic tubes and bottles 3. Rain, it just doesn't matter 2. Wind, see above 1. Get to freak out staring strangers by simply removing the hat  Best of luck to you and everyone!!!",

I initially also had been told only surgery then radiation, but like so many others, another path unfolded. I can tell you that I handled the idea of surgery and radiation ok, but somehow the chemo is so much more disturbing. Maybe it's because it makes the entire situation outwardly visible. And the hair thing is not about being vain. Not at all. Don't be too hard on yourself about that. I mean I had three surgeries and never really lost it until i had to wig shop, then sobbed. Those poor women at the wig shop LOL!! Luckily they have seen it all. Maybe that's the day it all hit home for me, and I was a few months in. And the idea of chemo, at least for me, was way worse than the actual doing chemo. I have had minor-ish side effects (weekly Taxol), and it's different for everyone, but for me at least it hasn't been as bad as I'd imagined. Hang in there. This is a phase you just have to get through to get to the good stuff on the other side. Best wishes!!!!",

In case you haven't considered that as an option. Also, many of you mention the Claritin for the bone pain, but for those who have the continuous drippy nose, like I do, I started Claritin as well and it has really reduced that drip. Again, it's a bunch of stuff to take, but it does seem to help. I ended up shaving my head on Thursday last week, and have a case of folliculitis (sp?). My scalp is very sensitive, but have ordered some 'Lindi's face serum' to help resolve this problem. No way I can wear a wig with this scalp, so hopefully it resolves fairly soon. My son has said that I rock the pirate scarf (the cap scarf that ties in the back), so I guess that'll work for the time being. :) I start round 2 tomorrow (I'm on a taxol only for 3 weeks, one week off). I'm not looking forward to it, because I really felt decent during my break week and most of the surgery stuff has finally healed, allowing me to feel more like a human being again.

You'll love having a wig. (Seriously? Spoken by a girl with hair down to her butt, I am quite sure she has rarely, if ever cut that hair!) 3. My [grandmother/distant/insert relative or friend name here] had cancer. She/He died. (Really? thanks for the pep talk!) 4. Why are you still coming to work? (Well, Einstein, I still need MONEY!) 5. Are you feeling sick? (Ugh. I just can't really respond to that.) 6. How are YOU?

The SE's? The \"I feel awesome even though I have cancer?\"  I have to say the majority of people are amazingly supportive, but to those few, who are just so socially awkward, they don't know what to say - I suggest a quick google search - what to say to someone with a cancer diagnosis: http://www.cancer.org/treatment/understandingyour...

It was traumatic for me after a couple of days of looking at wigs and not being happy with any of them (except the real hair ones which are insanely expensive). I was told that I might keep my hair with only Taxol chemo. Unfortunately, today (day 21), it appears that is not likely to be the case as I'm shedding like my black lab in spring. Probably more. Ugh. I've dealt with three surgeries, a month of chemo and annoying side effects (nothing horrible) and this particular part of things is throwing me. I'm hoping that I'll feel better about it tomorrow. I ordered some hats online today. Still unsure about whether or not a wig will be comfortable enough to wear or if I should just go the hat route. Thanks for all the pictures! You guys are all amazingly strong!!",

You'll just need to adjust your working time to account for treatments - you'll have good days and bad and you'll know fairly early on how that will go. Do you have any freelance partners that you could reach out to for backup if you need it? You could do it fairly seamlessly so the client wouldn't even have to know.

And as far as counts - I've maintained my numbers from week to week. I haven't had anything drop to far out of the 'normal' range. So no neulasta for me, so far.  I get treatments Tues and that day is out - exhausted. Wed, could be out, depending on my sleep Tues night from the steroid. I don't take the extra steroids at home before or after, and then the rest of the week, I'm very tired. I also have some aversion to certain foods, but I'm not a huge food lover to begin with. Have the dry mouth, water retention, etc. I also have some pretty persistent heart burn, but it's remedied with over the counter Pepcid. Finally, have lots of runny nose issues, that ended up giving me fluid in my ear - which is a typical issue for me, so I'm taking Claritin D to keep that under control.  I just finished my 5th treatment. I'm 3 on, then on the 4th week H only. I just did the second treatment of the second round this morning. The H only week (the week I lost my hair), I felt mostly myself. Hopefully this helps you! Chknfeet: Sorry to say, but I had a ton of hair, although I had cut it shorter into a JLawrence pixie/bob, and mine was noticeably patchy on day 3 after it really started coming out, plus it was a huge mess. I had it buzzed on a Thursday and my work had an event with Sheryl Sandberg from Facebook for 750 people the next day and I wasn't prepared for the hair loss (had been told by MO it might not come out on weekly treatment), so I hadn't gotten a wig. Only had cap/scarfs that tie in the back but have elastic, but had found some cute/comfy ones. I rocked that scarf at a 750 people event, and didn't feel bad about it in the least, and got lots of compliments - someone even said I was radiant. Haha! By the time you get to that point to buzz, you'll be more ready for it. Hope this is helpful. I know I tend to go on. :) Have a great evening, all!!",

I've pretty much left my hat on except for a few that are here most often. It's more me feeling insecure, I think, than the kids! They have said the same thing, it's just a bald head. They have had a sense of humor about it all, so that helps too. I think it's great that your daughter sees you vulnerable too, they need to know that you're human. I've always hidden hard stuff from them, and downplayed this situation at the very beginning, but that isn't necessarily the right thing to do. Now they know the full story, which is very positive considering, so, they are pretty at ease. My daughters have even said that I should 'play the cancer card' more often, LOL. Happy graduation to your daughter!! Did you know there are some scholarships out there for kids whose parents or siblings are cancer patients? Jaimieh: On taxol, I lost about 2/3's of my hair after week 3, but then it has been growing in on my head, so i have stubble again, just not everywhere on my head - like patchy. And your kids are going to be strong. Every kid has something to deal with, just like every adult does - - this is just our thing. xo Oh - and one great thing about being on Taxol in Michigan - - the mosquitos finally avoid me!! Woohooo!! :)",

I still am experiencing SE's\u2026mainly: no sleep the day or two after infusion (from the steroid and haven't found anything that works), a bad case of acne (started an antibiotic - but I was prone to that even now in my 40's), some D 2 days after - but resolved with immodium, a constant runny nose (claritin D seems to help), a dry mouth, my taste buds are off (meat is especially disgusting to me for some reason) and fatigue. I try to take a nap a day, even if for 30 min or an hour, and then I'm usually ok energy-wise. I'd say I feel better than my fears of starting chemo, but not definitely like normal. I have blood work every week and my numbers have stayed pretty constant so fortunately, I haven't needed Neulasta. I also take Herceptin and that's all I'll have this coming week/tomorrow. Hope this helps. Best of luck for you too!! mmtagirl: anything for ice cream, that's what I say!! :)",

It's getting warm, and I think I'm having serious hot flashes, so often the wig is just uncomfortable, especially for long periods of time. I feel like I can be more private with the wig - no questions, no looks. But with the scarf/hat and no hair, I get looks, questions and comments. Or, I feel like I have to justify why I have no hair with an explanation.  Brigadoon: You're so right about not knowing how much time anyone has. It's all we can do is fight. Footballnut: Glad you had a great trip! Hang in there. This is a marathon, that's for sure. Ddkath: The hair is definitely traumatic. I felt like it was one of the worst parts, in some ways. But, believe me, you'll feel better after it's out, just not having to worry about losing it. I've even shaved it again to get rid of the peach fuzz that was growing in. It was growing in like a horseshoe, old man hair. And when my hubs shaved it, it looked like the hair you get off a cat or dog when you brush them. Completely not normal hair. :) I'm back to the chair tomorrow, #8 of 12 taxol, could the end be in sight? I have some mouth sores forming. I don't think I drank enough water the last few days. Will not make that mistake again!!  Let's kick cancer's A$$!!",

They are all about the size of a peroid on a keyboard. The only one that hurt was the one on the breast bone. The others were like you got a scratch maybe. I will not be concerned about the ones on my sides because i have a bunch of freckles so they blend but the one in front I will have removed because it is visible to me. Best of luck everyone...oh!

I just finished 17 of 33 rads, so to those of you who are being thrown into that not expecting it - - it's way way way easier than chemo. The actual treatment for me is about 10 minutes, most of which is positioning and measuring. I got 5 micro-tattoos, although some use sticker and sharpies, all but one is not really visible, just the one on my breastbone is visible and I'll want to lose that one after treatment.  The worst part is the anxiety (like before we started chemo) of what it will be like and how it will effect us. The other tedious part is going every day. My girl is red and sensitive, but I've been doing an exercise class and working out every day (still gaining weight, but I'm active, dammit), and as long as I get a quick nap in the afternoon, I'm good. On days I don't exercise, I'm not as in dire need of a nap. I had my first bloodwork this week and I'm low on Hemoglobin - like 9.9, but not too bad, which I guess accounts for the need to sleep. I also have a gel thing that I keep cool in the fridge and can use when it is more sore, like when I'm more active, and that relieves the majority of the discomfort. I'm 8 weeks post chemo and I've got eyebrows and eyelashes again. And like many of you, about a 1/4 inch of hair that is enough to go wig-free 99% of the time. Although, today, it was pretty chilly here, nothing like snow, but I'm thinking I'll need hats again to stay warm!! I keep getting \"nice haircut\" from people - thinking that I chose a micro-pixie of my own free will, hahahaahah!  I'm having some major water retention from the Herceptin so today I got a prescription to hopefully resolve that. I wonder if I'll fit back in my old jeans after that - - 20 pounds or so of water, right?! Happy Friday everyone!!",

I got this at work today: \"You look really well\u2026\" in a surprised voice. So you haven't seen me in 10 weeks. You know I have cancer. Couldn't you just say - it's nice to have you back. The weather is great - - WHATEVER - - you look really well, pffft. Because, no, I don't look WELL. I have a wig (everyone knows, small office), I've gained weight, my skin looks - well- not good, I have these giant circles under my eyes, and drawn-on eyebrows. LOL.  So - about the acupuncture - going out of town, on a cruise - would anyone trust that person, because it's offered? Or maybe I should just wait until I return? I am anxious to get it started before I have another date with the chair. :)",
