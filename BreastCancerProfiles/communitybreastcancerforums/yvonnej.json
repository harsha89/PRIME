GP done everything, changed meds, scaned for liver involement, creams. Seen dermatologist he nothing to add. I wonderd if it was an allergy so stopping things one by one. Thought it was red grapes, but its erupted again. I do have rib damage leftside, with occassional periods of pain, and damaged skin, motttled under left cancered breast .Thinking about where my arms were during treatment, could this be an exit site? Radiotherapy side effect? Log in to post a reply",
