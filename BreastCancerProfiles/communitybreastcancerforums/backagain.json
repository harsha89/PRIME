So glad to get one behind me.  Felt a little fuzzy last night and didn't sleep much (probably the steroid) took some ibuprofen for headache but other than that feel great today.  Go for Neulasta at 4:00.  I told my chemo nurse about the claratin.  She was skeptical but said she would check with my doctor and the drug rep.  Hope to get some things done today before my chemo crash!  Thanks everyone for your posts- it is so nice to know what to expect.",

Being diagnosed a second time was devastating but I am amazed at how much progress has been made in breast cancer research and treatment in the 8 years since my first diagnosis.   Thank you all for sharing your strength and your stories.  The force is strong with us! ",

I get tired easily, but I just slow down and take a break.  I plan on going back to work next week. gilly - I think it depends on what combo's and meds you are being given.  I was six hours for treatment one, but my nurse said they like to go really slowly with the first tx to make sure there are no adverse reactions.  She said next time will be 4 hours or less.  On the subject of drinks - the one thing that I have found that tastes REALLY good to me are Smoothies from Tropical Smoothie.  My son brought me one that had strawberries, mango, and kiwi in it and it tasted great.  I think I'm going to have my DH bring me one at chemo.  I am having a lot of trouble drinking the required amount of water.   I drank 4 20-ounce bottles of water during chemo #1 and got the frequent flier award for trips to the bathroom.  Now water tastes awful to me.   And quarter here's a laugh for you about me:  After no bowel movement by Day 5 after chemo I decided to be proactive.  I wasn't feeling uncomfortable but after hearing all the constipation horror stories I figured a dose of milk of magnesia might be a good idea.  WRONG!!  I should have left things up to Mother Nature - things started moving immediately and I have now had diarrhea  for 3 days.  Lesson learned!  ",
