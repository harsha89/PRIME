I\u2019ve been followed closely for the last 10 years by dr Rosenbaum-smith in NYC (mt Sinai). The last few years I switched to screenings locally at a Breast center (Monmouth medical) Nj. After receiving initial labs immediately saw a local dr (kohli)who was actually trained by my NYC dr! She is fellowshiped trained, numerous accolades and certified in skin nipple sparing and hidden scar. Nothing but good reviews but only has only 5 years in practice. My ny doc obviously has 20 years More experience. However she and her ps shy away from direct to implant and are not advocates for pectoral nerve block. Any advice on how to choose? Should I get a 3rd opinion from MSK or Cornell? Thank you for any input. Trying not to decide on convenience alone. I have 3 small children and I need to get to the other side of this quickly hopefully! Log in to post a reply",

I was kind of waiting to see if I needed any further treatments after surgery as right now still looks possible I may not. I used to work for a hospital in the city and have heard mix reviews on MSK for surgery.... crazy that some people love it and others so unhappy. Although not ruling out getting an opinion. I\u2019m definitely sending my pathology after surgery for them to review and would absolutely consider having adjuvant treatments at their satellites. Thanks again",

In the end I think I have to accept I\u2019ve done my due dilligence and as all the candidates are exceptional surgeons have to go with my gut and pray for the best. Right now my preference is for a prepectoral direct to implant. I\u2019m really athletic and cutting into my pec muscle does not sound ideal. Although I realize things found out during surgery may throw that plan out the window. I guess my only concern with prepectoral placement is future monitoring but ps says there is no imcreased risk. My BS say that I\u2019ll have to fall into a very specific category for her to agree to pre vs post pectoral. All at once I\u2019m feeling I just want this surgery over and also scared of what I will wake up to ...",
