Two, that the bandages actually kept me from feeling the interesting and irritating sensations that follow nerve damage.  I find having much of anything on my chest to be uncomfortable, and irritating.  Hmm perhaps I should move to a nudist colony LMAO   The sensations seem to flip from phantom pain ( I know I don't have any nipples that could get pinched) to strange tingling that runs from my collar bones to the bottom of my rib cage and actually wraps around my chest to the underside of my arms and the shoulder blades.   there are actually moments when I want the bandages back or I simply want to go topless.  I do go topless at night, I lock the doors pull the curtains and pull off my top just to feel nothing for a little while.  I find my reach is limited due to the new scars that are forming, raising my hands above my head is still hard, and uncomfortable.   More so than any of that I want to talk about going out for the first time. It was a simple trip to the grocery store.  Pick up a few things for dinner, and go home.  simple right? NOT!  I found myself very aware of where peoples eyes settled, and often it was right at my chest.  I found myself very self conscious of the fact that I no longer have boobs.  It was difficult for me and very eye opening at the same time.   I put myself into a position to truly face the image of what I am as a woman, how I see myself, and how others see me.  I was probably far more conscious of it than anyone else.  I felt like I was some how less of a woman for a few moments.  It was not a nice feeling.  I avoided the melons and choose grapes instead.    That was the moment when I realized that it was me judging me, not anyone else.  It is easy to say stay strong you are still a wonderful woman, it is not so easy to believe it every minute of every day.   I am not afraid of how others will see me, I am more afraid of how I will see myself.   Afraid of what I will project to the world about me.  I feel broken, I feel less than I used to be.  Not all the time, but sometimes.   I am going to go buy a big pack of post it notes, and begin to leave reminders for myself all over the house.  I am a complete woman, I am worthy of kindness and love, I am beautiful just as I am right now.  Those are things I will remind myself of.   I will also give myself permission to cry and grieve for my lost boobs.  So there will be times when I am teary eyed and sad, I will also use those times to remind myself that my worth is not wrapped up in that lost tissue, it cannot be cut away from me so easily.  ",

I am unconcerned with keeping my nipples especially considering I am pretty sure I would have to loose the one on the right any way, I am already thinking of tattoos for the new ones when all is said and done. truthfully I am not sure that the surgery is as scary as the chemo I am facing. I am very small only about 100 lbs and am concerned about what it will do to me. you are right in that some days are better than others. I have days when I feel like a phoenix waiting to rise and others when I feel like I want to crawl into bed and never come out. I am grateful that my family will be with me, and that my son who is in the military will be home tomorrow to be with me for surgery. the hard parts are those moments when everyone knows there isthis ugly giant elephant in the room but we all try to ignore it. Thank you for the link will be going there right after this! can use some sisters to hang with and talk to after surgery. ",

Oh I have my moments when it gets to me, but for the most part I am not sad, or miserable. Everyone keeps telling me I am doing so much better than they thought I would. I don't know if that is just them being nice, or if I am just doing good. Either way I am happy with where I am right now, and good with how I feel.",

They are used to seeing me do for them and have never really had to deal with things like this. they have been amazing in getting things ready, and yes I do have a belief system, I am Native American, and we do our prayers every morning. I try each day to put my trust in the path I am walking and believe that each step will be guided as it needs to be. I go in today to deal with the last of the paperwork for surgery, and then out to dinner with my family for one last wonderful meal before I am stuck with hospital food. I will prob not be back on hereu ntil after I am home form surgery. I am about to boldly go where most fear to tread! Once more into the breach!",

Tomorrow is the big day for surgery, and already have butterflies in my stomach. It feels rather overwhelming, have family coming in tonight, and some of them are already here, trying to stay strong for them while dealing with my butterflies is hard, especially since I am putting one of my sons on a plane to poland today. He keeps asking if he should cancel his plans with is finance, and I keep telling him I will be just fine even though I don't really feel just fine. I think the hardest part for me will be the loss of my hair, being Native means my hair is very sacred to me, and the loss of it will be very difficult to handle. I keep reminding myself that it will come back, but it will never be the same. am thinking of having it cut (it is waist length) before chemo so I can place it with my other sacred items. It truly is a toss up as Native women do not usually cut our hair unless we are in morning or ready to cross over. though perhaps I will be in morning for what I have to go through. I do not know what my Creator has in store for me for the future, I just know that I will do the best I can to face this as the warrior I am, with as much dignity, and grace as I can muster on any given day.",
