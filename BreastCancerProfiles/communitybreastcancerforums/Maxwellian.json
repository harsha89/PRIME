She focused her attention on the right breast in particular ad shows me a big black area. I was told flat out ita not a cyst and it's not fibroadenoma.

I am waiting on doing biopsies Wednesday as I have to be off plavix for 5 days prior to biopsies or ahe would have done the same day she said. Log in to post a reply",
