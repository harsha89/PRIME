I haven't been able to afford to go back to the doctors to get it checked again as they removed one over an inch out of my right breast, and still have one in my lower left breast almost below my breast. Woke thinking about it at 4am... maybe I should try to get insurance and get them checked again. I wasn't able to feel the only on my left before and now I can big time. ",

I was diagnosed with PASH disease UDH/ADH, Fibroadenoma and I've always had polycystic breast disease. I was told to come back every six months for mammogram and ultrasound because I also had a tumor in my left breast but I could never feel it. Well five years later almost I am just now trying to get in for mammogram and ultrasound again. The tumor has grown so big I can feel it with 4 fingers together and I feel a burning sensation in the area along with rib pain as it is under my breast tissue on my left breast. I'm 31 years old. I\u2019m so afraid that this tumor that has grown so big is not good... ðŸ˜ž I wanna puke my nerves are so bad.",
