So I start chemo today (up and wired from the dexamethasone--weird stuff, but if it helps so be it) and I was given the wimpiest anti-emetic for the first go-round.  My chemo nurse told me if I feel sick to take it and wait 1 hour.  If it doesn't seem to work, call the on-call number immediately and the nurse on call will step up the pill to the next one that stops nausea.  I say A-OK.  she said they can keep doing that, so keep calling.  They'll prescribe 5 pills at a time until I find the one that makes me feel like I can eat and sleep without tossing my cookies.  That makes me so much happier...

Journal if that helps, find blogs, avoid negative people.  Don't Google!  Repeat, Don't Google!  Find people to care for your that you trust.  This is important.  I would give anything I owned to my breast cancer surgeon if I had to and I know it would be there when I came back.  I trust her with my life. Sleep a lot.  Dreaming has helped me.  And just keep posting.  You are going to be fine, it is just going to be a journey.",
