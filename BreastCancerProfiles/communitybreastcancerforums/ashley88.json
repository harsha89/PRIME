      "Content": "ashley88 wrote: As some of you may know from my past posts, my mother has breast cancer. In March she had a double mastectomy although she wasn't even a stage one. She did it to be precautious. She has blood work the other day and today we got a call from the Oncologist saying her lab results were abnormal. She only had a CMP & CBC. We are worried to death. The receptionist of course couldn't tell us what exactly was wrong, said the doctor would have to speak with us. It's like the stress is never over when you're dealing with cancer. You're always on pins and needles.  I also want to mention, my mother had a seizure in late June due to low potassium. It happened at work and they had to rush her to ER. Wouldn't the lab work they did there show abnormal results? Could this abnormal lab just be her body lacking some vitamin or nutrient?  ~Ashley~ The diagnosis is my mothers, not mine. She is currently in remission. Dx 9/1/2009, LCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, Grade 1, 1/2 nodes Log in to post a reply",
