The only symptom i had was back fatigue or a slight burning in my back occasionally. It was like sitting at a baseball game on bleachers without back support for a long time and your back gets tired. It definitely wasnt something i would have ever gone to the doctor for. I thought it was just from working long hours and bad posture at my desk.  I would want a scan for peace of mind, it may be nothing to worry about. good luck! Teresa",

Now as they have questions they will be comfortable asking and you will probably be more at ease talking about it with them on their level. My kids are older but when I told my kids- twin boys 16 and my 19 year old daughter I cried through the entire conversation (couldnt help it even though i had psyched myself into being strong) . They boys were so great and supportive telling me I had to be strong! But my daughter cried and said she couldnt live without me...i explained everything I could so they would understand. They initially didnt have many questions.  After those inital crying meltdowns and nesting episodes it has become much easier for me. I also have come to realize that im not going anywhere anytime soon and I may be around for a long long time! :D (((HUGS to everyone and our kiddies))) teresa",

Stay positive that if the one lesion became smaller the other one can get smaller too. Its normal to feel down when you get negative news. But then you have to get your head around it because the mind is stronger than the body. Embracing and Praying for you.. God is Good...he can heal..Believe. Happy Birthday.. Twins FTW!",
