Got my dx 2 weeks ago and was all set for a lumpectomy than went to BS today and she told me they found more nodes in the MRI. I've been a total mess all day. I thought I was prepared for the uni as plan b, but guess not! I feel totally overwhelmed thinking about the reconstruction options. Thinking of going with implants.but since they can't save my nipple I'm even more confused. Sorry, I'm just such a puddle. Thanks for adding me to the list...although I would rather be just about anywhere else Dana Maria and rk85 -- thanks for the laughs. Actually just realized I'm finally getting a tattoo. My DH has a few and I've always hated them. How ironic...I'm getting a tattoo and its a nipple! But on a serious note, is it going to look awful?",

I'm now just basically sick to my stomach all the time with nerves (I guess it could be all the chocolate and wine though too!). Thanks for the responses to my \"total panic\" email. I did meet with the PS....who by the way is 6'2\" and gorgeous. There should be a rule that all PSs should be old and ugly. :) I was so nervous about flashing my saggy boobs that I kind of forgot to be mad! Anyway, he was actually quite nice. Of course he did the soft sell for implants, which is his main business other than TRAM. I decided to go with the TE's for now with the plan of meeting other surgeons to investigate my other options (DIEP, etc) after recovery from the bmx. I feel good about the decision just wish it didn't have to come with all the anxiety. Did my pre-op stuff today too. Not a big deal but it does kind of put it in your face that the day is right around the corner. One last thing, I saw a couple things I wanted to pass on: ...for return home: plastic cups and bendy straws (may have seen this on surgery post but someone said it's hard to maneuver with our sad little arms after surgery). ...was looking at posts for feeling better after TEs: saw a suggestion for a book that seems highly recommended \"The Breast Cancer Survivors Fitness Plan.\" I'll let you know after I've taken a look at it. Sorry for the small novel. Sending everyone healing thoughts and peaceful dreams! Thanks, Dana",

The one thing I did do before talking with him was I went on the american cancer society site and they had some suggestions for talking with your kids. Basically it was reassure them that they didnt cause it and that they couldn't catch it. Those we're things I wouldn't have thought to mention. Otherwise, we gave him kind of the minimum info since he's pretty young. He actually asked really thoughtful questions like would it come back and would it go somewhere else in my body. That was 2 weeks ago and tonight was the first time I noticed him out-of- sorts (nearly cried when I told him what was for dinner....well, that does make my DH cry but not usually the kids!). I just told him we are al feeling kind of mixed up right now. He's not usually one to do much talking but he seemed to perk up after that. I wish I could offer more than support and encouragement. Good luck. I do think that our kids surprise us sometimes...in the good ways!",

It all happening way too fast and I'm freaking out because I have to decide about reconstruction! I did a lot of research this weekend and really want to do a DIEP and don't think the PS I'm seeing does it BUT am close to Chicago where there are more than a few experienced diep surgeons. But since surgery is next week don't have time to arrange for them to do immediate recon. So I'm leaning to postponing recon. So I call my BS to tell her and she said she doesn't really want me to postpone recon since it means she has to save the skin another way. While very polite to her on the phone I feel like I want to explode. Who cares if she has to do a little extra work. But I'm just feeling mad, mean, and totally panicked. Anybody else thinking of dealing recon? any suggestions ideas for me? I'm feeling like I'm going to absolutely lose it. Thanks, Dana",
