I have 3 kids of my own and between them and their friends I figured Â was exposed to lots of germs. I was careful to not share pencils and used the anti bacterial constantly. I took off on infusion day, did the neulasta at home the next day. I was lucky in that I finished the dd AC and only had 1 Taxol before Summer vacation- My bones killed me through the Taxol and I would definitely have missed more work for pain. I returned to work in the Fall 3 weeks out of chemo. Honestly I guess I lucked out because I only had 1 time my numbers were too low for treatment and the steroids took care of that. I made it through without even the sniffles.",
