Also, my wig looks way better with my hair gone.  Please keep that in mind for you girls who have your wig and your own hair yet.  My wig fits and looks better with my hair all gone.  What a rollercoaster of emotions! Ok, now to concentrate on WBC.  Good luck to everyone who had Rx today or will tomorrow.  We are doing this!  We are not alone, and I think of you guys when I am at work or scared. Have a good night. Mimi P.S, it is cold without hair!",

Firni I hope you are adjusting to your new look.  It does take a bit. Hey, do you girls think it is ok to drink o.j and cranberry juice while on chemo. Or eat spinach and other greens?  I have been thinking about this and all the antioxidants.  I hope it is not too much, but it was helpful for my cold sx.  I only take a multi vitamin.  Any input would be great.  And was the most recent post only regarding vitamin c supplements.  Is that differnt than drinking vitamin C? 2nd rx went well today, and my WBC was back to 10.8.  Crazy how it drops and comes back up.  I did not have to get a Neulasta today. Mary good luck tomorrow and good luck to the rest of you with chemo and SE this week. Good night, mimi",

Dr. Decker thanks for your support. :) Carol, how sweet is your husband?  My gosh what a sensitive man.
