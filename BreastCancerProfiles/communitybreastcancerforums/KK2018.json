Started talking to my doc about Taxol-dose dense versus weekly since dd would give me a good week like I\u2019m used to with AC and would get me done before Christmas. He said it was up to me. The efficacy is the same either way, but possible SEs are lesser w weekly. It\u2019s a hard decision. PNWC-I had my surgery before chemo (similar ex), but I struggle with the \u201cis this working\u201d because I have nothing to measure against. Are there other positive nodes in there? But I\u2019m trying to put my faith in the science of it and hope that I forever remain on the good side of statistics after this unlikely cancer debacle! Hopefully your tumor just needs a little more time before the chemo starts \u201cdissolving\u201d it. Robyn-for me I would describe it like mild morning sickness for a few days-no puking, but things taste wrong or smell wrong and I just don\u2019t feel \u201cright\u201d. And I\u2019m more tired than normal. But I\u2019ve had no aches and pains. For the most part I just take all of the meds like they tell me to and by the time the week is over I feel like myself again. My daily escape is fantasizing about travel. We spent 2 weeks doing Yosemite/Monterey and San Fran this summer, just days after my dx. It was amazing and exactly what I needed to process this life change. We do a big family trip to the Outer Banks of NC every other year (parents, brother and family, cousins aunt and uncle-we\u2019ve grown to 17 people) which is scheduled for summer 2019, but hoping to escape to the Caribbean or Mexico for some winter sun after chemo. The girls did so well city-touring in SF that I think they are ready for Europe-we\u2019ve been waiting until we were post-stroller! I would love to see NZ and AU but getting there seems a bit miserable w kids...if only business class were cheaper, lol! There is hardly a place I wouldn\u2019t go given the opportunity! My bucket list is almost exclusively travel-food and wine and foreign places ‚ù§Ô∏è I met a friend in NYC on Friday night and we had tapas at a cheap neighborhood bar and went to a concert and walked around like we didn\u2019t have a care in the world.

I kept up with things last week and enjoyed a couple meals out with friends but it wasn\u2019t as \u201cgood\u201d as my 2 previous off-weeks. Knowing it was the last one helped me maintain my mental health this past week as well, but it was a struggle. Talked about clinical trials with my MO today. He said he was going to do some research for me to see what the closest big cancer centers have to offer as far as the cdk 4/6\u2019s opening up to early stage since my regional hospital doesn\u2019t host any for those particular drugs. Not thrilled about 90 minutes in hellish traffic (which can easily double with a wreck) but I\u2019m obviously willing to make it work if I am part of some treatment arm of a trial! Trying not to be anxious about Taxol-it seems that most women say AC is harder, but the devil you know and all that. Started stalking that weekly page a bit more on here, too. Eyebrows and lashes and patches of buzzed hair are holding steady. I joked before I buzzed that I would be like my tortoise shell cat-my scalp would look multi colored since my hair was blonde/brown/red, and while my skin is all one color I do look moth-eaten with what appears to be patches of different color hair all over my scalp. Maybe it is just baby hair that is blonde and my old hair is brown. If I pinch the dark hair it comes out, but not if I don\u2019t give a tug. I\u2019m sure taxol will do in the remainder üò´ Before cancer I l.o.v.e.d wine. Like maybe too much. But I have had no taste for it whatsoever since chemo started. I miss having something soften the edges a bit after a long day. We do have medical mj here and I got a card recently but I just haven\u2019t gotten around to a dispensary. In my travels I have enjoyed getting dosed ediblesI don\u2019t want to get wasted-just want the \u201c2-3glasses of wine\u201d buzz I miss while cooking dinner and chatting with my husband! I think of you all often and wonder about everyone spread out all over the globe walking through this-It is truly an unexpected positive part of this experience. I remember when I was pregnant with my first and anxious about birth that I imagined myself as part of this whole ancestry of women who had done this before and the power that had been passed on from generation to generation. This has illicited similar feelings. I\u2019m sorry this is long. I find this more satisfying than journaling but then I take it too far! Strength and manageable SEs to all ‚ù§Ô∏è",

I know I was lucky, but I followed my anti-nausea regimen to the T and I got through pretty unscathed (ironic how my former self would describe unscathed and how I describe it now). Just try to keep up with the fluids. I lived on decaf english breakfast tea with milk and a bit of sugar - it was the only way I could ever reach the volume that was recommended. BeingPositive - I would love to hear how your DIEP went. My PS says he won't touch me for a year after rads - so Spring 2020. It feels like a really long time to have these damn TEs in, but I am slowly getting used to them. I can't say I can sleep comfortably on my stomach, but I haven't really done that since I was first pregnant 11 years ago. I debated between implants and DIEP for the last 6 months. I'm pretty sure I'm all on board with DIEP now. Beeline - you inspired me to interview for a different job. It was hard not feeling self conscious with extra weight, a wig and pencilled in eyebrows, but I think it went well. It's a bit of a reach as far as my skill set goes, but we shall see. I'm glad I did it. RE: endocrine therapy - I haven't been given any idea what will be prescribed. Obviously if we get into any of these clinical trials we will have to do OS + AI. I'm not sure how long I will want to do OS before getting them removed. I'd really like to reduce my number of Drs visits. I'm also slightly irritated because in my post Dr visit research UPENN only does PALLAS not MonarchE - but a local hospital does MonarchE but it is a competitor to my current hospital. I know everyone loves these big cancer centers, but if my local hospital is running the trial and it is 10 minutes from my house AND it is a \"better\" cdk4/6 as far as side effects go I wish I didn't have to get into it with my MO. I'd rather not drive 2 hours ESPECIALLY if I don't end up on a treatment arm! So now I have that email/phone call to make. Ugh. I called my MO today because the leg muscle myalgia is not improving at all. I'm not sure how I got through 20 weeks of chemo with minimal side effects and now have to deal with this, but they want to double check I don't have any clots, which is highly unlikely since the pain is bilateral and even - like I ran a 5K or did 100 squats or something. A clot would be most likely isolated in one leg. Another drs visit, another copay. comme ci, comme ca. It is 60 and sunny today - a 55 degree increase from a week ago.

Hello to all the fur babies. I have included a photo of my boy Dusty this time, affectionately nicknamed \"Mr. Luva Luva\". One week past my second AC and feeling pretty normal again, thank goodness! Thank you all for your kindness and uplifting words when I was down the other day!! Reflections on this second round: don't mess with the meds. I took half doses of 2 of my 4 days of steroids in the attempt to avoid constant hunger, heartburn, and jitteriness. I didn't feel awful, but I didn't feel as good as round 1. I also started taking prilosec instead of just eating pepcids - mostly bc they taste so gross. Also, I got my period, pretty much right on time and I think that may also have played into my sadness for that day or 2 before onset. So far it seems milder than it would be normally - we shall see today and tomorrow. My last AC is 10/22. Then 12 weeks of Taxol, which should end mid-January. I was told I would have a few weeks off before I started radiation, so I'm hoping all will be complete by late March, early April. Other observations: for those of you who had mastectomies, do you notice increased sensitivity during your treatment week? I had been healing beautifully (trying to give these frankenboobs some love and positive thoughts - they are far from beautiful) but I notice in the days after infusion the incisions seem pinker and achier and just \"off\". I showed my plastic surgeon who seemed mostly unconcerned, but he did put me on a weeks worth of abx and said I would only have one more fill during my AC portion. Again, this brings me back to the damn steroids, which also inhibit healing. It feels a bit of damned if you do, damned if you don't. All in all I am so excited for my \"good week\" that I have probably over-scheduled myself with fun things and placed too-high expectations on what I will accomplish around my house. Hope you all have a good week, too! ",

I'm not sure how I will feel through all of this but I am going to try to do as much as I can that makes me happy. Met with my MO today. 9/10 is my start date for my 20 week AC-T plan. Gahhhh - I'm nervous! Have my chemo class and Echo and some bloodwork and then I am all set. I don't want to do this but I want get started, all at the same time!",

Between the side effects, the possible damage to nearly all of my major systems, the list of food I shouldn't eat to the drugs for the drugs for the drugs. I'm thinking the Ativan script they threw in there had less to do with the supposed nausea than it does to the anxiety of having sat through that exhausting meeting. I have everything I need for Monday. My last drain is out and as long as nothing is red or yucky in that area I'm hoping my MO signs me off for chemo. I won't know until Monday right before my scheduled infusion!",

I asked my doc about the neulasta since I had zero side effects perhaps with the help of loratadine.

My mouth is weird all the time, I brush multiple times a day and try to do whatever I can to make it feel less gross but no luck. No sores or bumps though, so no advice there. My husband has been generally good. We own our own business that has had a bit of a rough patch since my diagnosis - we kind of left things to be run by his business partner and our staff and it is noticeable when we are not actively participating in the day to day - I personally find it a decent distraction but I think my husband is buckling a bit over trying to shore up our only form of income, having to reinvest personal money back into the business and trying to help run our household with me not firing on all cylinders. But hearing both he and his business partner complain about their workload and everything is sometimes hard for me to stomach. I want to say that I have to listen to their shit AND feel like shit and still get shit done so a little less whining and sighing and little bit more positivity would go a long way! The house isn't quite falling down around us but I find that I am more irritated that it isn't clean bc I am staring at it all constantly, too tired to really dig into any of it. I finally changed out some decorations that said \"Spring\" on it. Clearly that is where time stopped this year. I'm on day 5 which has generally been a crap day post-infusion. I'm also due for MY cycle but who knows if that will happen this month. Watching a handful of friends celebrating their 40th birthdays via facebook and trying not to get depressed about it since my 40th was 2 weeks before my bmx and I felt like my world was coming to an end. I look like hell, I don't feel great and am struggling to find things to look forward to. While this 8 weeks was manageable I feel this heavy weight when I think of the next 12. Maybe food and drink won't taste as terrible on Taxol. That would be nice. Thankful for the weekend and for the promise of rain - it will be nice to have no excuse but to stay inside.",

I am becoming increasingly more fatigued but I think that is because my red blood counts are slowly dropping into the anemic range. WBCs are still at the low end of normal. Going to have to focus on some iron rich foods but not sure that will really be any competition to chemo. I've been searching on here how they handle anemia and chemo and I hope I can get through the next 7 treatments without needing any transfusions. I have a busy few weeks ahead am I going to really have to figure out how to manage it all. It is a bit overwhelming. The hot flashes are annoying. I am a go with the flow kind of person but I really hope that this happening every.single.night comes to an end sooner rather than later. My sleep is so restless and it is starting to wear on me. I asked about regular massages since I feel like the last 6 months have completely wracked my already poor back/posture (between sitting at a desk all day, large pre-cancer boobs, nursing for numerous years, etc my poor back was a mess before surgery and then compensating for the mastectomy, sleeping propped up for months and then muscle loss from not exercising my upper body as much as I was used to I am in rough shape). I was told to avoid lymphatic massage since we don't have lymph nodes in our arms any more we don't have anything to stimulate. I was also told to avoid deep tissue massage as well. So gentle massage is ok, preferably by someone who has decent accreditation. Most likely in a chair since laying on my stomach for any period of time is pretty impossible. waaahhhh. i just want a good massage. I think about you all often and how you are getting along. This site has really been such a positive outlet for me and i look forward to logging on and catching up with everyone's posts. Have a great weekend! ",

Piksie - before I finished AC I reviewed the weekly taxol versus the DD with my MO in the hopes that I could do DD - I would finish before the holidays, I would have my week off like I did with AC - it just seemed more manageable than doing this weekly for 12 weeks. He talked me out of it bc of the reduced SEs and exact same efficacy. If you are miserable maybe you can discuss switching it to weekly? I know the SEs are cumulative but so far I feel so much better than I did with AC. Thanks for the burrito tips - I think I will wrap up a few dozen to have as quick meals when I'm just not in the mood to cook! A woman I know from my children's school was diagnosed a few years ago and I reached out to her to discuss when I was diagnosed. She literally could not remember anything - she didn't know the size of her tumor or the drugs she took - but she did remember that she had positive nodes (but doesn't know how many) and had to do radiation - she kept saying, I'm not sure - you'd have to ask my husband. I still shake my head in disbelief - I guess some people really are able to block it all from their minds. My brain doesn't work that way! Met with my PS today and he thinks my frankenboobs look \"good\" and don't need additional fills - I agreed with him, and then he looked over at my husband asked him if he thought they were big enough (they are significantly smaller than they were when they were mine) and I literally cut him off and told him it doesn't matter what my husband thinks. I was laughing but seriously - what year is it - 1965? And my PS is probably in his early 30's so it isn't like he is from an older generation! Oh well. I'm glad that I have fewer doctors appointments to deal with since I don't go back to him until radiation starts. I'm starting to get used to these TEs that I will be stuck with until 2020! HA. ",

She is also fitting me for a sleeve - it was her position that any woman who has had a node dissection should wear a sleeve daily through radiation and should wear it during exercise/flying/heavy arm use. I have good insurance so I am going to follow her suggestions and do the twice a week therapy. The thought of spending more of my life as a patient is disheartening - especially during this time of weekly taxol since this means I will have 3 separate days per week where I have appointments 40 minutes from home.

That being said, you would have to smoke or eat a lot to reach those levels of thc-25g per day. The occasional gummy or puff off a joint to ease nausea I believe is still reasonably safe, and is no more potentially carcinogenic than alcohol is said to be for us hormone positive ladies, too. I spend most of the time being positive about my future, but I think about my previous joie de vivre and I wonder how I will express that in the shadow of cancer. I feel like this has robbed me of my innocence, so to speak. And the kicker is that I knew and appreciated how beautiful my life was.

On one hand the flexibility and what I get paid for it is unrivaled but on the other - I am working for my husband and his business partner and I'm tired of having all of our eggs in one basket, so to speak, and I know my husband agrees - but I don't know if he really understands how much different things would be around here if I worked for someone else as far as children/school/after-school/etc. Going to have to just put my feelers out I think. As far as physical activity - I shuffle around doing my normal activities but I definitely need to kick it up a notch. I don't particularly enjoy exercise in theory but I always feel better when I have done it - but going to a germ-infested gym isn't high on my priority list. BeingPositive - I start Claritin (actually generic loratadine bc I'm cheap) the night before chemo, so I have a couple days worth in me before my neulasta on pro goes off. And then I take it for a week with nightly advil for god measure. So far, so good. I might be occasionally achey - but I'm still dealing with sleeping awkwardly with these damn tissue expanders and continuing my lifelong poor posture from being in front of a screen all damn day. As far as lumpectomy/mastectomy goes - lumpectomy was not an option. My tumor was too big. And I honestly didn't hesitate with choosing bilateral because I didn't want to worry about recurrence in that \"good\" breast (happened to a friend 10 years after her original dx so she had to do the whole rodeo twice) and I have some fantasy that I may have relatively symmetrical frankenboobs when this is all done? As much as my large- breast-fed for nearly 4 years- breasts weren't what they were when I was 25, they were pretty damn symmetrical and that really matters more to me than size does when this is all said and done. Reconstruction is often on my mind (bc of these uncomfortable TEs) but I really won't know what my true options are until I finish radiation and determine whatever damage that has done. Fairchild - my friend went through the Her2+ regimen and her SEs seemed similar to yours. I believe it really does a number on your digestive tract and with that effects fluids and potassium, etc. I'm sorry that you have to go through that extra-tough portion. Day 2 so far has been uneventful and I am getting a full day of work in. Always start to dread what may come up days 3-5. Carb-loading has been the most effective at managing my nausea - bagels, cereal, pasta. I haven't lost or gained a pound so I'm going to roll with it. Not how I normally eat but at least by next week I can load up on protein and veg!",

Still struggling to bounce back - normally by Sunday I feel human again, but yesterday I had diarrhea all day and it has continued today. Probably going to call the MO tomorrow because I'm afraid I'm not keeping up with the fluid loss. I'm wondering if this is something one of my kids brought home or if this is a SE (my daughter had a stomach bug 2 weeks ago that I thought the rest of us had avoided). Friday night into Saturday I really crashed (assuming from the steroids). I napped on and off and pretty much didn't leave my bedroom on Saturday. It is really hard to feel positive on those days and I find myself reading boards here that I don't belong on - or rather, that I shouldn't let myself get sucked into. I used to love living inside my own head - I was great at escaping and managing my emotions and generally being able to cope with whatever was going on in the outside world. On these hard days I feel like I lost my safe space - it is Cancerville all the time in my brain. As I am preparing to get past this Final AC next week and move on to Taxol I am starting to get nervous - as much as I am glad to be almost done with AC I do enjoy having a week off. 12 weeks seems like such a long slog. I'm also reading about this Pallas trial and think I should enroll but then can't imagine 2 more years of side effects on top of whatever the hormonal therapy throws my way. And also considering ovarian suppression so I can go on an AI instead of Tamoxifen since they have better recurrence prevention rates. I think I'm just not in the right phase of treatment to be considering the next phase - the whole one day at a time thing I guess - because it all seems awful and like it will be unending. I remember in the last days before my surgery I cried to my husband that what if this was the last time I felt healthy and whole again for the rest of my life. And after surgery I thought, well, I still feel like me and look like me. Right now I don't feel like me. I don't look like me. I am laid bare. Sending positive thoughts to you all - I will try to readjust my sails....",

I may have panicked when my headwrap fell off after I jumped and strangers saw my bald head, but I did all of the things yesterday and I feel quite accomplished-attached are 2 pics from Coba-from the bottom To the top.

Waves of sadness and panic but there\u2019s no getting off this train so I guess here I Go! Thank you all for responding. I know this board is going to be such a lifeline over this next year",
