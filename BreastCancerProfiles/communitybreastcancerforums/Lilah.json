Once you've had this surgery you should consult with an Oncologist and a Radiologist to find out your treatment options.  Lumpectomy is often treated with radiation, for example, and that is something to discuss with these two types of doctors.  It can't hurt to make appointments now as a follow up after surgery (and recovery from surgery). ",

I am also going to opt for the unilateral MX (although if my BRCA test is positive I'll do the bilateral -- that said, I will be surprised if it is because no one in my family has had BC or cancer of any kind for that matter).  Glad to hear you don't regret your decision patsfan!  It is so reassuring.  I too will opt for an implant and agree it would be nice if there were a perfect option.  For me, an implant seems to have the least amount of risk (and the least recovery), which at this point is most appealing to me.

I have an expensive human hair wig that I LOVE and wear all the time.  I never have a problem with styling it (in fact ALL I do is brush it).  I also got some very comfy wig caps/liners from TLC Direct (I think their website is www.tlcdirect.com) ... 100% cotton and I think I got 2 for $12 and it's a natural/nude color that does not show through/read as anything other than skin... makes ALL the difference as far as comfort.  Before I got the wig caps the wig I have was VERY itchy... after: not itchy at all.  I can wear the wig for hours and hours. Marie I'm not sure why mine was itchy but it was.  It's not lined.  There are different kinds of wigs and this is one that is meshy and designed so that you can see through the part to your scalp (which makes it look VERY real).  BTW, your wig is wonderful!  I would not have guessed that the hair in your pic/avatar was anything else but your real hair!  WTG!

I finished 4xAC DD and started Taxol/Herceptin almost two weeks ago (will have 3 more Taxol DD and Herceptin until end of next summer)... lost most of the hair on my head (and I had had it buzz cut just before it fell out so what's there is very short).  I had thin hair but long and looked thicker than it was.  So two things: one -- my underarms, which were completely hair free due to AC -- now appear to be growing hair!  Is that possible?!  I didn't expect to see any hair growth until after Nov 9 (my last taxol) -- but there is definitely stubble there.  Re: Nioxin... because my hair was thin my hair dresser had sold me some last year and I never used it... am wondering whether it's okay to use it now?  Marybe you said you used it \"the whole time\" so I'm assuming all through chemo?  I can't tell if hair is growing on my head yet (don't think so) but am wondeirng what the Nioxin can do? Thanks! Lilah",

Re: eyebrow pencils and powder.. I just went to target and bought a few that had pencil on one end/brush on the other... I'm betting that if you got to Macy's or Bloomingdale's or Nordstrom's or any big department store with a bank of cosmetic counters you can get someone to sell you some powdered eyebrow material and brush (or whatever) as well as show you how to use it.  My advice though is that your brows will grow in pretty fast and an inexpensive pencil/brush combo will probably do for the few weeks they are truly gone (as opposed to in-between). I agree Jenn they do define your face.  It wasn't until I lost all my lashes and brows between Thanksgiving and Christmas that I felt like I truly looked like a cancer patient.  It sucked.  I am relieved to have them back and fingers crossed they don't fall out again.

Sherri -- I mostly lost my eyebrows and lashes AFTER I finished chemo.  I finished on November 9.  By Thanksgiving my eyebrows were sparse.  By Christmas I had NO eyebrows or lashes BUT by New Year's I had them back.  The day after Christmas I realized I had five o'clock shadow where my eyebrows had been and the hair had come in visibly by New Year's (probably thickened up a bit a few weeks after that but what I had by New Year's was good enough)!  So the answer is: they come back fast. Jancie -- as far as I can tell the eyelashes are even.  I don't bother much with makeup either.  Since I started chemo August 1 I wore it exactly once -- at Thanksgiving  -- because my mom asked me to put some make up on so I would look bad LOL.  Mothers are so pure, aren't they?  She was right.  I did look better/healthier with it on!  Lilah",

CCBaby -- you look gorgeous!  Michelle -- I think mine fell out a little at a time for awhile (while on Taxol) but then I did have a week where I kept noticing little hairs on my laptop (so am assuming I was rubbing them off then transfering them to the surface of the keyboard).  Hope that's not TMI :)  They are tiny and there aren't that many of them, so mostly you don't notice the loss -- at least not the way you get the hair loss on your head.

Iago (or is it Lago -- i or L ?) -- your typo is funny above (frozen \"pees\" -- LOL -- I'm sure you mean \"peas\")... I had long hair (past my shoulders) all my life...

Warrior -- re: getting started with public speaking... do you know what you'd speak about?  If you can draw up a plan for a public speech topic (I assume related to BC) you could contact your local cancer center or hospital or breast center and see if they are interested.  My local breast center, which is also where my onc is and where I get chemo, runs all sorts of seminars and I can imagine that a BC survivor speaking on the things you need to know (for example) might interest them.  Sometimes with public speaking, it seems to me, it's a matter of starting and then word of mouth takes over. LookingForward -- 13% isn't bad when you consider that 12.5% is what anyone's chance is (prior to ever having BC).   I DO think though that your chance of recurrence with BC IS less after 5 years... that's what I am told anyway.  But that MAY be specific to my pathology and the HER2+ and Herceptin.

I know -- for me -- seeing my Onc was the most helpful step in the process (surgeons don't really tell you much except about cutting you :)  If you do have to do chemo, don't worry.  There are great drugs now to help with SEs and the worst thing that happens is you lose your hair, which grows back.  I too found the thought of chemo terrifying but now that I've been through it I have to say the terror OF it was far worse than the chemo itself.",

Anyway I think you are already having your surgery (or have had it) so I am writing really to say: I am another one like you.  More women, I think, get bilateral than unilateral.  I worried for a few weeks about whether I would have a satisfying symmetry with unilateral, but the truth is you can have symmetry issues with bilateral, too.  Bottom line is: find a PS who you trust and who listens to you.  And remember that nature rarely creates perfect symmetry :)  God knows my original breasts have never been terribly symmetrical.  Cheers, Lilah",

I definitely agree with Gina -- counting down the weeks was a big help in getting through it all.  Lilah",

I have not seen that movie.  I have to put it on my Netflix list.  It's the one about the discovery of Herceptin, right?  I've read comments on this site about it... sounds great!  I am grateful for Herceptin. Welcome 5Timewinner! I had fll #2 today -- so far so good (knock on wood) -- only a little discomfort which advil handles well.  Going to Atlantic City tomorrow to ring in the New Year!  See you all in 2010!

Lowrider - my heart aches for you having recurred to stage 4 mets.  I just finished my Herceptin so I guess that means I'm a year out (I had two lumpectomies, then CHEMO, then my MX -- by which time the tissue removed was all NED)... which I recite to say: I'm still close enough to the whole experience that I don't feel like I am cured though of course I was thrilled to hear the NED pathology.  So I am cautiously optimistic -- and occasionally I live life without a care or a worry and that is countered with days of great worry -- most of the time though I'm just in a careful state of mind, maybe even an NED state of mind (which is not a cured state of mind).  I address all of this to you because I wondered -- since, if I read what you wrote right, you seem to feel you ignored a sign/symptom -- what was the symptom you ignored? Thanks all for this very worthy subject. ",
