I live in San Luis Obispo, CA, which is on the coast halfway between SF and LA. My bc is Stage 2, Grade 3, ER-/PR+/her-. I had a bilateral mast. on 5/15 with immediate reconstruction. Didn't expect chemo as they thought it was just DCIS. But found one node positive and IDC so made me glad I opted for the mast. I met with my onc. today and will begin chemo on 6/4 with 4 DD AC and 4 DD Taxol. We're going to try it without a port and see how it goes. Fortunately, one daughter will be coming home from college next week to help me go wig/scarf/hat shopping, as I am clueless in that department. I'm a court reporter and a runner and a soccer player. I have an amazing group of friends and an adorable black lab, Levi, who, along with my family, will help me get through this. But to have friends like you all who are beginning or have been through this same journey is invaluable. I'm so glad I found you. A dear friend of mine from college just sent me a beautiful necklace that I wish I could give to all of you. It's a simple silver beaded necklace with a small silver piece with the word \"Courage.\" This is what we all share. It doesn't mean we won't get down or scared at times, but we will continue to pick ourselves up and move on and get through it. Thanks for being there to help me along!",

But the good news was I did have a \"significant\" urinary tract infection.  I'm just happy that that is what it was, that antibiotics can treat it and I don't have to do more testing.  Phew....I was really stressed out for a few days.   Today I thought I'd be bragging, saying I only have two more treatments to go, but hopefully I'll be saying that on Thursday! To all of you with grandchildren, I'm jealous!  I love hearing about them, and I can't wait to have my own.  Although I don't say that too much around my daughters quite yet!  But I sure will love it when they come. Hope you are all having a good week. xoxo Kathleen",

I've been busy with my family leaving me!  One daughter went back to college five hours north of home, my other daughter left for Italy for a college semester abroad, and my husband started a new job three hours south of home.  I went from a full house to an empty house in one week.  I was fine at first, but it's starting to get a little lonely around here.   I have had my sixth Taxol tx and I have six to go.  This is the first week I've felt extremely tired since I started Taxol.  My blood counts are the lowest they've been and I really feel it.  I'm hoping I don't get my tx delayed.  I'm planning to visit my daughter in Italy 17 days after my last Taxol infusion, and I'm beginning to think I won't be able to go.  I'm not sure how fast we bounce back after our last treatment.  Does anyone know? Just like some of you, with my family gone, my black lab is now sleeping on my bed.  I'm sure it interferes with my sleep, but I don't care.  He is such good company! I get so frustrated as well listening to people complaining about every little thing.  I feel like I worry less and complain less than I did before bc.  I realize now that my complaining or worrying isn't going to help keep me safe or make it better.  I did have a little scare and drove four hours to my plastic surgeon to be reassured.  My tissue expanders started rippling, but it looked like lumps in my breast.  He told me it was normal and that some other smaller lumps were from the sutures around the Alloderm.  It was worth the drive to find out everything was okay.  So I guess I do still worry! Terry, congratulations on your wound healing and no more packing.  That just sounded so uncomfortable and frustrating, as if we aren't already uncomfortable enough! Shrink, I wish you the very best and that the rest of your treatment does the trick.  You are in my prayers. You are all in my thoughts and prayers for few side effects, great appetites, some rest, and a great weekend. xoxo Kathleen",

I hope everyone stays safe and warm with the harsh weather out there.  I feel a little guilty as I'm complaining that it is getting a little cold at night, into the 30's, but it is in the 60's and sunny in the daytime.   I sure would love some snow at Christmas though.  Here in Central California that would be a miracle.

Gracie, you lived in Italy!  What a wonderful experience that must have been.  I was there in 1979, backpacking for two months with a friend.  It was the time of my life.  This is trip will be a little different.  No sleeping bags or train stations to sleep in, hopefully.  I can't wait! Terry, I'd love to get the link to the website of your local dragon boat team.  It might give me some ideas as we get our group started.  Also, did you decide not to do the Tamoxifen or Arimidex?  I think we are both ER-, slightly PR+.  My oncologist is leaning towards not giving me either.  He thinks the risks outweight the benefits.  What have you been told? Debbie M., good luck with your scans.  I guess I won't be getting any until I get back from my trip.  Maybe it's better that way.   But I am anxious to get all the tests done and get this all behind me. Dawn, good luck with your last few treatments.  I felt like the last ones were the hardest, mainly because I felt so close to the end, but it really wasn't over yet.  I guess I was overly anxious.  I hope it goes fast for you.  You'll be celebrating this Thanksgiving for sure! Debbie K., so you are having rads after having a mastectomy?  I had a bilateral mastectomy and haven't been told to do rads, but now I'm wondering.   If you don't mind me asking, do you know the reason?  I've really wanted to be as aggressive as possible, and although rads don't sound like fun, if it will keep this monster from coming back, sign me up. Garnetann, good luck tomorrow!  I will be thinking of you.  It is such a great feeling.  I'm still celebrating! Denise, you mentioned tatoos.  The only tatoos I have read about are the ones I will need after my reconstruction is finished.  They tatoo the areola and then add the nipple.  It's kind of hard to imagine, so I haven't really researched it much.  One step at a time.  My exchange surgery for my implant is in January, so I think tatoos come a few months after that.  Quite a long process.  Linda and Cyndi, thanks for the info on the lymphedema.  Loose fitting clothing is something I need all the time now due to the hot flashes, so I've got that covered!   And layers.  I get so cold and then so hot.  It's funny I had to ask my doctor about the lympedema.  I would think it would be standard procedure to mention it like your doctor did, Cyndi. Hope everyone is doing well.  My best to you all. xoxo Kathleen",

Terry, thank you for the wonderful website of the dragon boat team in Buffalo.  I'm going to forward the link onto my group for ideas for our website.  The video is really beautiful. Those Buffalo women are very inspirational! Debbie K., thanks for the info re rads.  Now I'm worried I'm not getting radiation.  I will see my surgeon next week and talk to her why I'm not getting it.  I hope there is some clear-cut reason rather than being in the \"grey\" area, which makes it so confusing.  I had one lymph node with microscopic cells and a tumor less than 1 cm.  But now I'm reading that radiation really improves the odds even with small tumors.  So much more to learn.  Good luck with your rads. Dawn, thank you for offering info on the breast reconstruction.  I am really curious about the next phase of this process.  Did you have implants, with the tissue expanders first?  I have so many questions about the exchange and the nipples/tatoos.    Cyndi, I sure hope that UTI clears up finally.  I'm so sorry you ended up in the hospital.  Things can get out of control way too quickly during chemo treatment.  My doctor gave me some antibiotics for my trip, just to keep on hand in case I feel some infection coming on.  I hope you continue to feel better! Gracie, did you request the BCRA test or did they do it routinely?  I really want the test done, mostly for my daughters' sake.  The more information we have, the better prepared we can be.  Congrats on being BRCA negative!  I'm feeling few se's from my last chemo.  I went back to work yesterday for the first time in four months.  It was a little difficult to concentrate, but I know it will get better with time.  I also changed my walk with my dog to a very slow jog with my dog.  We both loved it, but I'm a little sore today!  I hope you all have a wonderful weekend. xoxo Kathleen",

Shrink, I was so happy to hear you were done and the tumor had shrunk so much.  What wonderful news! I want to respond to each of you, but I'm still recovering from jet lag so I will make this short. I just got back last night from 12 days in Italy...Rome, Cinque Terre, Florence, Venice, Milan and Lake Como.  Nonstop travel with my best friend as we were celebrating our 50th birthdays and visiting my daughter who is studying over there.  I had a wonderful time.  I was achy and sore from walking and walking and walking and stair climbing up Duomos to see the views, but it was worth it.  Honestly, other than having to put on a wig every day, I almost forgot about the bc.  If I can figure out how to post pictures, I will post a couple pics in a day or two. Like I said, I really didn't think too much about the bc during my trip, but when I was almost home and in the bathroom at LAX there was an older woman with a bald head.  I saw her and didn't say anything, not knowing her situation.  But on my way out another woman was speaking to her, telling the woman her own story about breast cancer and her hair growing back.  So I came up and pulled off my wig to show my head, and then another woman walked up and did the same thing.  It was amazing and brought tears to my eyes.  Here were four of us women, all of different ages, all with this common bond.  It honestly brought tears to my eyes.  We spent a few minutes hugging and chatting and then went on our way.  But I will never forget it. I know most of you are doing rads and chatting over on those boards.  I wishyou all the best of luck with that.  I questioned my oncologist and surgeon about my doing radiation, but they both agreed I didn't need it after my bilateral mast.  It's funny how I didn't want treatment in the beginning and at the end it's almost as if I can't get enough treatment.  I will continue on this board for a while as I will be getting Herceptin until next August.  I said this would be short and instead I rambled.  I think it's time for a nap.  Take care and hooray for all the June 2007's! xoxo Kathleen",

Cyndi, my eyes have been extremely red as well.  Coincidentally I went in to get some new glasses (left mine at the airport!) and I mentioned it to the optometrist.  He thought it was due to dry eyes so he recommended Systane for dry eyes or Octiv (or something like that).  I started using the Systane and it does seem to help. I have a disgusting little story to tell.  I finished my shower yesterday morning and grabbed my towel that was hanging over the shower door.  I was still in the shower while drying my head with the towel.   I love to just rub my towel over my barely-there new hair and I was really enjoying it.  Then I noticed on the shower floor some black specks.  I thought it was black lint, but had no idea where it could have come from.  I took my towel wrapped it around me and stepped out of the shower.  Then I saw what I had thought was the black lint.  There was a parade of black ants running up and down the corner of my shower door, exactly where my towel had been hanging.  I had just rubbed those nasty little things onto my head.  Of course I jumped back into the shower and was really freaked out.  What a mess to clean up.  I'm sure they made their way into my house as we were having our first real rain of the season and it had been pouring all day.   I always seem to get ants with our first rain but I've never seen them near my shower!  What a way to start the day! Anyway, I hope you all are feeling well and are able to enjoy these last few days before Christmas.  I just love Christmas!  xoxo Kathleen ",

Garnet Ann, it's interesting what you heard about the trauma and stress from 18 months prior. My father passed away 16 months prior to my diagnosis and I had a really difficult time with it.  He really was my hero and that whole year I had a hard time.  I was just starting to feel good again and moving on when the bc diagnosis occurred.  I wonder if there really is any relevance to it. I am enjoying my coffee this morning.  I finally like the taste again.  It really gives me great pleasure!  Have a great Saturday everyone. xoxo Kathleen ",

I thought the Neupogen shot was $2000, but it turns out it's only $200, so I was able to pay for it until the insurance authorizes it.  It's still expensive, but not quite so outrageous.  I got one shot today and I will get it again tomorrow.  Hopefully my counts will go up so I can get chemo on Monday.  Terry, I hope your cold resolves quickly and you're able to get chemo next week.  We don't want anything to stand in the way of that last treatment!

Bgcrutcher, you'll find so much valuable information on this website.  When I was first diagnosed I went to the threads \"Just Diagnosed\" and \"Help Me Get Through Treatment,\" but you should read whatever interests you.  This group started chemo in June and some of us are done, some are beginning rads and others are still getting treatment.  I wish you the very best with your treatment.  And keep reading, you will find an amazing strength from these women who post here. Cyndi, did you get a UTI?  Hope it was taken care of quickly.  Mine was quite a scare but was gone in a few days, thank heaven.  At least we have a good connection with doctors to get us the medicine we need ASAP! Gracie and Terry, I hope your scans came back clear.  I will hear from my onc next week on my follow up procedures.   I hope he schedules scans for me as well.  When you finish chemo do you always get at PET scan or CT scan? Shrink, I hope you are feeling good and looking forward to the countdown.  I have two treatments left also.  They can't come soon enough for me! Linda, congrats on being done with chemo.  When do you start rads?  I had a bi-mast so I won't be doing rads, but I will be doing Herceptin until next August!  Oh well, it's got to be easier than chemo. Dawn, that was so funny!  My first thrill in quite some time was when I realized I had a 5 o'clock shadow!  My hair is mixed dark brown with white so it was definitely a shadow.  Even though my hair is barely a quarter inch long, I took out a soft brush today and brushed it.  It felt so good and actually made it look better. LOL.  Of course, I'm sure I'm the only one who would notice.  :) Denise, I had the weirdest sensation getting Taxol and Herceptin a couple weeks ago.  I really can't even describe it, but it was in my crotch :) and it felt like I had bugs running wild down there.  It only lasted a minute or so, but it was really creepy!   Garnetann, we will finish chemo the same week.  It's getting so close! Debbie K. and Terry, I will be flying too on November 2.  I'm flying from California to Rome. I have several connections with my longest flight being 7-1/2 hours, but a total of 21 hours of travel.  I totally forgot about getting a sleeve.  I've heard mixed opinions on whether one is required when you have no symptoms.  I had five nodes removed.  I will check with my doctors this week to see what they say, but what do you two think I should do?  How could I have forgotten about this?  Yikes! Debbie M., I'm getting better all the time!  I love the Beatles!  My husband plays guitar in a band that plays oldies and they play that song.  From now on that song will have a special significance in my life!     I love it! Bonnie, how are you doing this week?  Taxol/Herceptin #11 will be Wednesday for me and then #12 on Tuesday of next week and then I shall be done!   I need to find a big bell like the one you rang! I hope all of you are doing well this week.  Only two more weeks for me!  Yippee! xoxo Kathleen",

I have really good news...last Monday I had Taxol tx. 7/12, and I am now absolutely sure my hair is growing.  The top has lots of grey and peach fuzz, but the back is beginning to look dark and is actual hair!  I honestly can't believe how much it is growing.  And if I look with a magnifying mirror very, very closely I can see little stubby eyelashes and eyebrows starting to grow.  I didn't lose all my eyebrows, but they are so very thin and sparse.  I always had dark eyebrows with dark eyelashes even though my hair was very light brown.  I feel like the loss of the eyelashes and eyebrows has really made me look like a cancer patient.  But it's all coming back and sooner than I expected.  Of course I've read where some women see the regrowth and then they lose it all again.  Yikes, I hope that doesn't happen.  Unfortunately I do wonder does this mean the chemo is not working?  I guess the fear always creeps in.  I think I'll quit thinking about that part and just enjoy looking in my magnifying mirror! xoxo Kathleen",

I'm really scared right now.  This morning I saw blood in my urine.  Or was it vaginal bleeding?  I'm not even sure.  First I noticed it on the toilet paper, a light pink color.  Then I noticed a drop in the toilet.  Then there were a few very small clots.  And now, six hours later, there is nothing.  I called my onc's office and I went for a urine test and he prescribed some antibiotics.  Of course I am praying for a bladder infection, but why the clots?  It couldn't be my period.  I haven't had one in a year.  I hate this.   Thanks for letting me vent. xoxo Kathleen",

I went for a meeting last night of breast cancer survivors who are putting together a Chinese dragon boat race team out of Morro Bay, CA.  I guess there are teams all over the US, Canada, Austraila, New Zealand and some do it for fun and others compete.  Our group is just getting started but it sounds like fun.  I'm not sure I'll have time for it, but I'm going to give a try.  Lots of great women of all ages.  Have any of you heard of this?

My eyebrows are crazy right now.  I've lost most of them, but what are left are long and wirey, but I don't dare pluck them.   Then there are new ones growing in, lots in places where they shouldn't be, but I don't dare pluck those either since I could lose the long ones that haven't been lost and then I'd have nothing.  Luckily my wig has heavy bangs (something new for me) and when I wear my beloved baseball hat, it gets pulled down as low I can wear it!   It sure will be nice when I begin to feel a little less self-conscious.  Oh, one thing I want to share...a little upsetting, but I had to laugh.  I was shopping for a purse to take on my trip and I found a Fossil bag.  I had a 20% off coupon for the store today and I asked the saleswoman if the coupon could be used for a Fossil bag.  She said, \"No, that coupon can't be used.  But you can use your senior discount.\"  I'll be 51 in December, but I never thought that I was considered a senior.  I just said \"Okay.  Thank you,\" with a big smile and walked away.  Oh, well.  I had to become a senior some day.   Hope you are all having a good day. xoxo Kathleen ",

Garnetann, I am really sorry to hear about your calf.  They are such beautiful animals.  I am sure she was quite a blessing to you during this treatment. Dawn, how are your blood counts doing?  I hope they've come back up.  Mine went down to a critical point, so I did get two Neupogen shots and they shot back up.  I thought I would continue to get the shots, but they don't give them to me until they bottom out again.  I hope you get the shots if you need them. Bonnie, it was good to hear the blood clot would not keep you from getting that last treatment.  I hope you are feeling well and I'll be thinking of you tomorrow as you ring that bell! Terry, Congratulations!  Today should be the day.  It's been a hard road for you with the slow wound healing, but now it's time to celebrate! Gracie,  I've been concerned about my blood tests as well.  My liver enzymes have gone up and down since treatment and it scares me that there is something going on with that.  But I have read that Taxol raises those levels as well, so all we can do is go with what the doctors tell us and wait and see what happens after our bodies have gotten a little rest from all this chemo.  Congrats on being done and I'll be praying for you. Cyndi, I'm sorry to hear about your friend's husband.  I'm sure she is grateful to have you there as her support, especially someone who realizes what it is really like to go through chemo.   Debbie K., it's great to hear you are feeling so good again.  That's what we all want to hear.  Just thinking about being done with treatment gets me excited! Debbie M., I get really down too when I hear or read about women with recurrence.  There are a number of women I see on chemo day who are being treated for recurrence.  Most of them are very positive and look like they are doing great.  But when I start to read too much about what can happen, I get very depressed.   It's hard to not think about, but I'm trying to convince myself that when chemo is over, I will not look too far ahead and just concentrate on the present.  Easy to say, hard to do.  I'm glad you were able to see your daughter perform.  I know the feeling.  There is nothing like seeing your child looking proud, confident and happy! I have three more treatments.  I should have been done on Sept. 15, but got extended with the weekly Taxol (changed from dd 4 tx).  The extra month was hard to take at first, but because the tx is every week, the countdown goes quickly.  For those of you who are finished or are finishing I hope you continue to let us know how you are doing.  It keeps me moving forward and gets me excited as the end is in sight. Best wishes to all, xoxo Kathleen",
