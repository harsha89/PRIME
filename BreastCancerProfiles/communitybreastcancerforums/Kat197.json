I had found a lump in my breast about a month ago, so decided I better get it checked out. I was sent for the mammogram and ultrasound by my nurse practioner, where it was confirmed that it was indeed a lump. lol But since the radiologist couldn't tell me if it was a cyst or not, he recommended a biopsy. The doctor who saw my results, also recommended the biopsy. So I said \"Ok\" and had the biopsy yesterday. I was very scared to go through that procedure, but I did it. All by myself. :) My husband had to work, so I decided I could do it on my own.Â  Now the waiting game starts. I can phone to the clinic to get my results tomorrow, or wait until Tuesday when i see the doctor. I'm thinking I'm going to call tomorrow! They took 4 samples of tissue. It was a hard lump, no liquid. I guess that doesn't mean anything at this point, except that it's not a cyst? Thank you to all who post here. I don't feel so alone anymore. Log in to post a reply",
