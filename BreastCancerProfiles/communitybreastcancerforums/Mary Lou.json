But the sisters here have years of info to share. I was in this same place almost 3 years ago. Got the word on Sept 20 and by the 26Th was in surgery to remove the beast. I had a 12 cm tumor and also nodes involved. Stage III B IDC. I'm fine today, and am beginning to get used to my \"New Normal\" I hope your wife comes here to speak what ever is on her mind, and I really mean what ever is on her mind. If she is pissed, scared , mad or something has happened in her life that has nothing to do with cancer she is welcomed to vent, cry , scream....what ever! This is a tight sisterhood and we all have each others back. We hold the hands of those that have to fight the hardest. And we cheer for those that seem to have beat the odds. Take your wife by the hand and tell her that you can get through this just as you have many other things in the last 35 years. Together you will get through this. You are a wonderful husband to write in behalf of your dear wife.",

My long hair was gone, and people didn't even know who I was. It was a part of my daily routine , and it was no longer there to take care of. I felt out of place.

And I don't think my body should feel as if a mack truck hit it either. I would be fine if I could just feel tired and lay down with out it becoming such a sign of being lazy in other peoples eyes.",

I know I have signs of what is called Vaginal Atrophy. I'm going to see my GYN about it this week. This may explain..... Relief for Vaginal Atrophy, also known as Atrophic Vaginitis can cause a number of side effects that can make sexual activity uncomfortable and even painful. A lack of lubrication or vaginal dryness is one of the most common complaints for women experiencing this condition. Lyriana is a world-wide patented topical gel that can help: Clinical studies have proven Lyriana's effectiveness in treating symptoms of vaginal atrophy. So if you're tired of trying temporary lubricants and want to avoid potentially dangerous hormonal treatments, learn more about Lyriana and discover why it has turned around so many women's sex lives. This is a link, make sure it is okay with your Doctor. http://www.lyriana.com/ppc2/vaginal-atrophy/cont/index.html?ucroi_kw=vaginal%20atrophy&ucroi_adid=27950&ucroi_google_type=std Also this link http://www.webmd.com/cancer/tc/ncicdr0000062859-factors-affecting-sexual-function-in-people-with-cancer Sexuality and Reproductive Issues (PDQ®) - Factors Affecting Sexual Function in People With Cancer  Sexual dysfunction may be multifactorial; both physical and psychological factors contribute to its development. Physical factors include functional damage secondary to cancer therapies, fatigue, and pain. In addition, cancer therapy such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation may have a direct physiologic impact on sexual function.[1] Medications used to treat pain, depression, and other symptoms may contribute to sexual dysfunction. Psychological factors include misbeliefs about the origin of the cancer, guilt related to these misbeliefs, coexisting depression, changes in body image after surgery, and stresses to personal relationships that occur secondary to cancer.[2,3] Increasing age is often believed to be associated with decreased sexual desire and performance; however, in one study, elderly men reported that sex remains important to their quality of life, that performance can be maintained into the 70s and 80s, and that altered sexual function is distressing.[4] Treatment-Related Factors Secondary to Surgery A number of cancer treatments have a direct physiologic impact on sexual function. As treatment success has improved for some sites, attempts have been made to modify treatment to reduce sexual morbidity. Several predictors of postoperative sexual functioning include patient's age, premorbid sexual and bladder functioning, tumor location, tumor size, and extent of surgical resection. Breast cancer Sexual function after localized treatment for breast cancer has been the subject of a good deal of research. Several reviews concur that breast conservation or reconstruction have only a minor impact in preserving sexual function compared with a mastectomy alone.Women who have breast conservation, in particular, are more likely to continue to enjoy breast caressing, but groups typically do not differ on less subtle variables such as the frequency of sex, ease of reaching orgasm, or overall sexual satisfaction. A cross-sectional survey of younger women (aged 50 years or younger) with breast cancer found in multivariate analyses that having a mastectomy was associated with greater problems in interest in sex; chemotherapy was associated with greater sexual dysfunction.Other studies confirm that sexual quality of life is disrupted more among those receiving chemotherapy, those who have undergone total mastectomies, those whose cancers were detected at later stages, and those with more depressive symptoms near the time of diagnosis. Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy increases the rate of hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal discharge, and increases the risk of premature menopause in women older than 45 years by approximately 10%. Furthermore, though rates of sexual activity with a partner did not decline, women taking tamoxifen reported slightly increased rates of difficulty with sexual arousal and achieving orgasm. Few studies evaluate sexuality in women with breast cancer that recurs. One longitudinal study compared women who were recently diagnosed with recurrent cancer with matched patients who were disease free. The recurrence group had less frequent intercourse, although there were no differences in sexual or relationship satisfication. As noted in other studies of women with breast cancer, sexual changes were more common among younger patients.",

But I pulled my big girl panties up and got on with life. I'm a firm believer that God knows the plan and I must watch the signs he gives me. About the neulasta, I didn't like it at all, the pain was horrific for me. But when I didn't take it (just once) my count went down and there was an unknown infection and I had to go into the hospital for 3 days. I never did that trick again. Just take the pain pills, I was trying to be a strong lady....Not a good idea either. One thing to watch for is constipation....stay on top of it or you will really suffer.",

Not that any of us wanted to learn any of this for a membership to the \"CLUB\". I'm a very straight forward person , I don't sugar coat things that matter. I learned about neuropathy here on the boards. I was able to tell my Dr stuff. & he in turn used that to help my sisterhood at the cancer center. One thing he didn't understand was the nails, finger nails he was used to, but not the toe nails. I was so upset at looking and feeling like a train wreck that I could scream. As far as the neulasta, yes it makes you feel like the flu....and the leg pain can be bad. But the back it where it really got me. The chemo kills every cell in your body....then you make new in the spine. There is where the pain is. Like I said I had dose dense chemo, every 14 days. You will see people put DD AC blah blah blah....you just start to short cut after being here for so many years. By the time I even began to feel like a human it was time for anther DD. You will have every emotion known to man. It is your right, and no one will totally understand unless they have been there. Please copy your post and keep them. I go back and read some of my old ones from 2005 and think to myself.....DAME I am one tough woman...... And I am, ME & GOD can face whatever comes. It is a very long journey even if all goes well....So try to think about where you are going rather than where you've been. There is life after all this. You will have a \"new normal\", takes allot of time to get used to. I was the old way for 49 years and fell apart before I got to be 50.   I didn't know I was sick till I was told. I just know I was tired, very tired. And as I look back I guess there were signs that i just passed off. I had a 12 cm tumor, yeah guess I was tired. But I'm glad that I fought like a wildcat, did what I had to do to stop this beast. I have a grandson since my treatments ended, and he is going to have a sister in May. My oldest granddaughter is now a teen, will be 14 in May. I have seen my boys both buy homes and life is becoming life as I knew it. I'm just the one who is forever changed. And that's okay. It's what I do with what I have learned that matters now. God never gives us more than what he knows we can handle....but he wants us to handle it with him right there at our side. Even when we think he is no where around, he is watching. I believe that with all my heart and soul. I count on God to never leave me. That is where that trust comes from. Oh dear, Barb, I have written a book....Just got caught up in the moment. I have been feeling sorry for myself this past week, I believe God lead me to your thread......To open my eyes, and appreciate what i have this very day. Sorry to ramble, and be all over the place with subject matter, I can thank Chemo Brain for that one!",

It will show pictures. The reason I am having the surgery is I have no brain to keep up with a fake boob the is not attached. I lose it all the time. And as far as looks, that is not happening. I just pick good pictures. This morning while I was getting ready for work I looked in the mirror and said i look like a train wreak.....",

      "Content": "Sep 30, 2008 08:50AM Mary-Lou wrote: Just some info I came upon. It is a bit long , but worth the read. In the 1990s, AIDS activists were inspired by the ribbon medium, and decided to make ribbons for the people that fight against AIDS. The ribbon that represents AIDS became red as this is the color of passion. During the Tony awards, a photo was taken of the actor Jeremy Irons, who had the bright red ribbon pinned on his chest. As the public followed the awards, the ribbon was an eye catch and became popular overnight. The year 1992 was declared by The New York Times as \"The year of the Ribbon\". In the fall of 1991, the Susan G. Komen Foundation handed out pink ribbons to participants in its New York City race for breast cancer survivors.[1] The next year, Alexandra Penney, who was the editor in chief of Self, a woman health magazine, was working on the second annual National Breast Cancer Awareness Month issue. Evelyn Lauder, who was the senior corporate vice president at Estee Lauder, was invited to be the guest editor of the NBCAM issue edition in 1992. Penney and Lauder came up with the idea to create a ribbon and to enlist the cosmetics giant to distribute it in stores in New York City. Evelyn Lauder then promised to spread the ribbons in the entire country, but a color for the ribbon was not decided on at the moment. Charlotte Hayley, who battled breast cancer, produced peach color ribbons. She sold them with a card saying, \"The National Cancer Institute annual budget is 1.8 billion US Dollars, and only 5 percent goes for cancer prevention. Help us wake up our legislators and America by wearing this ribbon\".[2] Her message spread fast. This made Penny and Evelyn Lauder interested in Hayley's concept. They saw the initiative to adapt to Hayley's idea by working with her. But Hayley rejected the offer saying that they were too commercial. After discussing opportunities with Lauder, Hayley and the lawyers, they came up with a \"new\" color. The new color of the ribbon was pink and became an international symbol for breast cancer awareness.  [edit] Organizations and programs The aim of Pink Ribbon International is to create a supportive community worldwide and to inform patients, specialist, families and friends about Pink Ribbon and Breast Cancer. During Breast Cancer Awareness Month each October, people raise money by organizing activities such as theme parties or a \"pink day\" (when employees wear pink clothing or accessories) at work. The money raised is donated to the organizers' choice of breast cancer care or research programs. The original 'pink day' is called wear it pink and is organized by Breast Cancer Campaign. In 2006 this event raised £3.5m in a single day, and 2007 marks its sixth anniversary. Breast Cancer Care's In The Pink which raised £800,000 in 2006.  [edit] Products Each October, hundreds, if not thousands, of products are emblazoned with pink ribbons, colored pink, or otherwise sold with a promise of a small portion of the total cost being donated to support breast cancer awareness or research.[3] The first breast cancer awareness stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued 1996. As it did not sell well, a new stamp with an emphasis on research was designed. The new stamp does not feature the pink ribbon. In Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint produced a silver commemorative breast cancer coin.[4] 15,000 coins were minted during 2006. On one side of the coin, a portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth is illustrated, while on the other side a pink ribbon has been enameled. Additionally, 30 million 25-cent coins were minted with pink ribbons during 2006 for normal circulation.[5] Designed by the mint's director of engraving, Cosme Saffioti, this colored coin is the second in history to be put into regular circulation.[6]  [edit] Intellectual property status In most jurisdictions, the pink ribbon is considered public domain. However, in Canada, the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation claims ownership of the ribbon as an official mark, a special form of trademark reserved for governmental and charitable organizations. [7]  [edit] Critical movements  [edit] Pink Ribbons, Inc Associate professor of kinesiology and health studies at Queen's University Samantha King describes in her 2006 book, Pink Ribbons, Inc: Breast Cancer and the Politics of Philanthropy how breast cancer has been transformed from a serious disease and individual tragedy to a market-driven industry of survivorship and corporate sales pitch.[8] King writes that, in an unprecedented outpouring of cause-related marketing, large businesses have turned their formidable promotion machines on the promotion of breast cancer awareness, while also opposing public health efforts (such as stricter environmental legislation) and stifling investigation into why and how breast cancer affects approximately one woman in 10 in the developed world. King questions the legitimacy of privately funded efforts to stop the epidemic among American women and the consistent NBCAM emphasis on screening (such as free mammograms) instead of fundamental research into causes. She also questions the corporate focus on breast cancer, which kills one-tenth as many woman as heart disease, the #1 killer of women. More women get skin cancer than breast cancer, and more women die from lung cancer than breast cancer, she notes, but these other diseases do not attract the same level of corporate -- or consumer -- attention.  [edit] Breast Cancer Action San Francisco-based Breast Cancer Action has renamed the annual awareness campaign \"Breast Cancer Industry Month\" to emphasize the costs of treatment.[9] Their \"Think Before You Pink\" campaign urges people to \"do something besides shop.\"[10] After explaining that some \"pink\" sponsors are polluting industrial giants or spend more money on breast cancer-themed advertisements than they actually donate towards research or treatment, BCA asks consumers to reflect thoughtfully on questions like, \"How much money was spent marketing the product?\" or \"What is the company doing to assure that its products are not contributing to the breast cancer epidemic?\" This group has particularly excoriated major cosmetic companies such as Avon, Revlon, and Estee Lauder, which have claimed to promote womens health while simultaneously using known and/or suspected cancer-causing chemicals, such as parabens and phthalates in their products.[11]",

Caffeine has been implicated as contributing to both the symptoms and scarring (fibrocystic) changes in fibrocystic breast condition. However, when the scientific evidence is reviewed, the results are conflicting, and no firm benefit of caffeine restriction can be scientifically established. Additionally, there appears to be no evidence that caffeine increases the risk of breast cancer. However, in women with fibrocystic breast condition, it might still be worth a trial of caffeine restriction. (Note that coffee is not the only source of caffeine. Tea, chocolate, and certain soft drinks also contain caffeine.) There is no harm in trying caffeine avoidance, and there may be a few fibrocystic breast condition patients for whom it is beneficial.",
