I am going to see the consultant in the hospital where I work and go to the breast care team at the previous hospital where I did my placement as I am a student nurse. Really hoping I can get some more information. 2 weeks seems like a lifetime right now to wait for my surgery. I am trying to keep positive and telling myself that everything will be okay",

I am only in my 30's and was told today that after having a mammogram and biopsy last week, I now have a radial breast scar. There is a strong breast cancer link in my family and the BRCA 2 gene is there also. None of the websites that I have looked at have been able to give me any reassurance as to what caused this or what all of this now means. I have constant pain in my left breast so I never have a moment where I dont think about this. I have no idea if the pain is related or not",
