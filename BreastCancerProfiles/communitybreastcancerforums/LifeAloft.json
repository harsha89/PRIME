I guess that is a question that I need to ask her.  Notdoneyet, that's  my fear, that I will read something and have no idea what it means, and get myself all worked up for nothing. ",

My regular physician is off this week, so that's adding to my worry that things will be delayed getting to me. She had told me to call Tues if I didn't hear anything...so of course I called today :). The breast center nurse coordinator said 48-72 hours, but like you said, the holiday weekend likely threw things off. I will definitely be calling again tomorrow, I don't care if I make a pest of myself.  I'm a Birads 5, so I'm prepared for the worst, hoping for the best...but I'm sure everyone on here understands... I just want to know and move on.  Thanks again for your input!",
