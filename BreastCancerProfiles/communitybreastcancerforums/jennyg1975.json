I found incredibly difficult to tell my coworkers in my small company about my cancer and I couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be like to have all of my personal health details out in the public. ",

I just wanted to let you know that it is possible to have your nodes react to a biopsy, because mine did. I had a core needle biopsy, which diagnosed me with DCIS. When I went for my presurgical MRI, one of my nodes showed enhancement and became swollen. My breast surgeon, GP and oncologist said it could very well be because of the biopsy, and it turned out to be true. Moira is right-this is the worst part. Her post provides excellent advice. I wish you all the best.",
