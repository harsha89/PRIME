I started with the pain and stiffness, almost unbearable, while waiting for my lumpectomy last April. In between that and the second surgery for lymph node removal (6/18 positive)in May, I had an infection of the breast, on antibiotics, and then to hospital every day for 17 days for IV ant-Bs. I could hardly get in and out of the car, the pain and stiffness was so bad. Been on various pain-killers, hydromorphine, gabapentin, now going to try Lyrica. All my docs, including oncologist and a rheumatologist say it had nothing to do with the cancer. During chemo from June to October  it was slightly better, probably because of the steroids. Then radiation ending end of November. I still have a slightly red, sore breast and the oncologist told me that I was cancer free, but to keep and eye on it and go back to him if it spreads in case it's inflammatory breast cancer. He thinks it's just from the radiation. To say I'm freaked is to put it mildly. And of course, I'm as stiff and sore as I ever was!",
