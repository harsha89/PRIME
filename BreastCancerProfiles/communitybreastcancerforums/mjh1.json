You didn't say whether you will also b having reconstruction after lumpectomy. If so u my want to meet the PS that either of these doctors work with b4 u decide. While having a good BS is important, it is even more!important to have a very skilled PS to do your reconstruction. I personally didn't like the atmosphere at Weill Cornell and I just went there for a second opion with a PS. I ultimately chose Dr. Choi at NYU to do my second revision and she did an amazing job. I havent met anyone one here that.wasn't pleased with the BS or PS at NYU.",

NYU is next week. I hope that will be better.",
