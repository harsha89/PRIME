Its been hard, i am a single mom and i still have 2 young children at home, its hard to keep from crying around them,and when my older ones come around, i just cant wait until its bedtime to go cry alone,  you are in my thoughts and prayers, its been hard so far, but we will all make it through this together, best of wishes, sue xo",

I am on antibiotics and i have had a nurse come everday for the last week to pack my wound with sterile gauze. i went to see my surgeon for my results and found out there is cancer in 1 out of 4 of my nodes they took out, i am booked for an axillary dissection to take out more nodes next week, that is if my infection is cleared up, then i was told i will be going for liver and bone scans and chemo, i am so scared i just want this all gone, i am having a hard time staying strong for my family I h, especially for my  11 year old twins, i am a single mom ( i have 3 grown children with 3 grandchildren) with 2 children at home with me, the financial situation is getting to me,, i just wish i would wake up from this nightmare, i am trying to stay strong but am getting weeker by the day,",

I go for bone, abdomen and heart scans this week, not sure when i start chemo, i guess after i heal up? my emotions are still going on a roller coaster, try so hard to not let my kids know i am tired and scared. so tired of hearing people say, oh youll be fine, my neighbor, or aunt hairdresser's mail-lady, or dog groomers sisters 3rd cousin had it and they are fine,thats good they are better but these comments dont make me feel better, were they their whent these people had their surgeries or chemo,etc. or having a bad day, or through all their pain, i dont think so, one older woman had the nerve to say to my daughter at work, thats no big deal,that her neighbor went through it(and she knew i went through a mastecomy and a node dissection and all the problems) We are having the best summer in years and i cant enjoy it, i cant wait until next summer, i just want to jump into a lake and cool off, and splash around and have fun with my kids and grandbabies. hoping to have a better day today, sue",
