Just wanted to say, for those of you facing rads after chemo, I am totally thrilled with the Canadian protocol so far.  I have 4 more regular tx, then 5 boosts, then I'm done.  So far, no skin issues, a few shooting pains that I'm told are normal (ie. everyone gets them apparently), a little fatigue, and sometimes a mild sore throat right after the treatment.  I am so happy that I will be done in another 1.5 weeks!

Off to the UK on Saturday for the holidays, major long flight, will be wearing my compression sleeve of course:-(  I cannot wait to see my family over there. Happy Holidays to you all.

Cheyanna, I'm sorry you're going through all this stress, but I don't think starting chemo a couple days later will make any difference.  I'm not starting until almost 8 weeks post surgery, didn't think I was going to be having chemo at all.  My onc. and surgeon both said it probably took years for my tumor to get big enough to see on a mammogram, so i think if there's any little cancer cells floating around I have a little time to zap them!
