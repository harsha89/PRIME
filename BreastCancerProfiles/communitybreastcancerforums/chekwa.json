I will have my ultrasound tomorrow and I will see my doctor the next day so I will let you all know of the results. About the gene tests, I really don't have any idea about it and I haven't asked my relatives, who were cancer survivors, what kind cancer they had before. I will keep you all updated... hope it's benign again just like the cyst that was taken from me before. To BJ09... we will get through with this.... just pray.... that's what keeps me strong right now.. HUGS TO ALL!!!",

HUGS to all!",
