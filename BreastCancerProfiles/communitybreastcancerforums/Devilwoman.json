Over a month ago she got mono and she is always tired she is always cold and never gave her breast a thought i know all girls grow at different rates. She recently dropped from size 11 to size 4 in womans she has a appetitr only for junk food which we are trying to change now we have her on vitamins. Anyhow last weekend she said her breast hurt, i took her to ER after finding a hard egg sized mass in her big breast. Little breast feels soft. Er sent her to dr.on monday and that doctor said she has a large marble it doesnt seem to really move and that her areola is mishapped as well and so she has a sonogram on monday. Im scared to death... She is 12. Lost and confused. And praying for her to be ok. Log in to post a reply",

My daughter who has been thru hell with a abusive brother just had mono two months ago, we moved and is struggling at new school she's always tired, she has recently went from a size 11 to a size 5. She is 12 her name is Bella and she has had for over a year a breast that was three times the size of her other breast I thought nothing of it at first...then she complained this last weekend it hurts...she doesn't eat a good diet she eats junk food which we have now bumped up fruits and veggies anyhow she has a breast mass... Her breast mass is the size of a large marble..the doctor said her areola is shaped and looks abnormal...she is scheduled for ultra sound on Monday... We tell her she is to young for breast cancer but I fear it. Not sure how long we will have to wait to get results of ultra sound...but I got people praying for her she has been on antibiotics for ear infection... Just scared any advice would be welcomed.. Tammy Blessings to all.",
