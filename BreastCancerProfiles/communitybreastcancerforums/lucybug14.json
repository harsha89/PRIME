I've ordered some all-natural semi-perm hair color called IPOIRO. The plan is that I'll dye back to my preferred color (apparently my hair went all white during the years of coloring) after. It supposedly will wash out in a few washings. Has anyone else used it? My hairdresser is totally against it but she's a pretty negative person and I think it would be a cool way to celebrate having the worst behind me. ",

It's very thick and about 3/4\" on top and in the back but sides are shorter and not as thick. The shock is that it came back bright white. I knew my hair was turning grey but didn't realize my whole head was white. My oncologist told me I can start using permanent dye after it goes back to its original texture -- right now it's super soft. I plan on using semi-permanent all-natural dye when it's a couple inches long. I always wear a wig in public and am so sick of them. However, this past weekend I got a facial and massage and didn't wear a wig because it would just get in the way. The woman that did my facial said she thought I just had a very edgy hairstyle. That was great to hear but will still wear a wig.",

      "Content": "Feb 6, 2017 05:30PM - edited Feb 6, 2017 05:32PM by lucybug14 Finished chemo on Nov 4 and didn't start to see hair growing back until mid-Jan. I was getting worried (thanks to the taxotere commercials) but my oncologist's nurse reassured me. She has been working for almost 40 years and can count on 1 hand the number of women that never got their hair back. I was whining to the nurse at the radiologist and she pointed to her head and said \"this is what it looks like after a year\". It really moved me that she would share that with me and we talked about life with no hair. However, it is growing back BRIGHT white. I had been coloring it for so long there's no telling how much grey I had but I'm thinking it was quite a bit. My hair was very thick and curly and though now it is not long enough yet to curl it is pretty thick on top but thin on the sides. I'm thinking about dying it pink when it's a bit longer to celebrate then end of all this stuff. Can't wait until I have hair a few inches long! My eyelashes have been kind of funky -- didn't fall out until maybe a month after chemo ended and now have grown back. They're not very long but at least I have them. My eyebrows have thinned (always were too think anyway). No hair on my legs yet -- hooray. My eyes water constantly for about 6 weeks. They dried up when I started Reiki treatments. Not sure if that was the reason or if it was just time. The other annoying symptom I have is my fingernails are very discolored -- look like a french manicure gone bad. I really don't mind that but I've lost half of 2 nails so I'm using a nail strengthening nail polish hoping to keep the others on until they grow out.",
