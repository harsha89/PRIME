The hair on my head, armpits, legs and private area is coming back and I am back to shaving. Throughout my treatments (4) I kept my eyelashes and eyebrows. I noticed this past Monday morning after showering and starting to apply my makeup that my eyebrows were....very very thin, almost gone. Eyelashes the same way. Did anyone else experience this? This is almost the end of November and now I lose my eyebrows and lashes? I saw my Oncologist Tuesday and I don't think he understood what I was asking...He said they were coming in just fine...I told him noo you don't understand I am just now losing them. He said they would grow back, I know they will grow back I'm not an idiot, I was just curious as to why they decided to take an exit now two months after chemo.",

Update from me: Had my 2nd round of chemo yesterday. 2 changes made for possible recurring side effects. Prilosec OTC for the acid reflux like some of you have received. Took some when I got home yesterday as the steroid was really causing it to flare up. It worked! I ate dinner with no acid reflux!! Yayyyy, Second change was eating ice cubes during chemo infusion for both the taxotere and the cytoxan for the mouth sore situation. I am truly hoping this works. Onc said eating the ice would cause blood vessels to constrict in mouth and chemo couldn't invade so easily to do damage. Keeping fingers crossed as that one seemed to be the worst and most painful for me. Go for my Neulasta shot at 11 a.m. I had no effects from the last one and nurse said my counts were good so that may have done the trick and my counts were excellent according to my Oncologist yesterday after my first round of chemo so hoping no side effects this time either as far as bone or hip pain. Got another new wig and lol gotta be honest, have never been a blonde or a redhead and I'm experimenting now! I have two and one is human hair the other is synthetic. Going today to have them styled at my hair dressers. I'm still liking the headscarves, head turbans and my little ole yellow fishing hat the most. These don't make my head sweat during this heat. It's only been a few hours since my 2nd chemo treatment but I truly have faith it won't be as my primary doctor has said and kick me to the curb this time. I just don't foresee that knowing who I am and what I can accomplish when I pray and have positive thoughts. Hugs to all and I hope Mellie you are feeling better about losing your hair soon. Yes it's a very important part of being you but remember after chemo it will grow back and maybe better than before! I am so very glad to see most of you are doing things, planning things, having an upside to all of this that you are going through. Just remember it won't last forever and then we truly can get on with our lives! Heal On ladies, Heal On!! xoxoxoxo",

Busy day for me and day 6 after treatment number 2. I woke up early this morning for some reason so I am just going with it. Have to move our sons things to him an hour and a half away. He started a new job. He's just out of college this year but still taking classes this fall to get his Bachelors degree. So proud of him! I am concerned about going, with today only being the 6th day after treatment. I am still a little tired. Hubby told me I could nap in the truck when needed. We are taking my pillow and blanket. Soriya - I have tissue expanders in both breasts currently. I will be getting my implants after all chemo treatments have stopped. My last treatment is September 19th, then have to wait for the side effects, then have to wait until blood counts are up enough to endure surgery for the exchange to implants. I am guessing end of November, first of December. My plastic surgeon is very picky and very health conscious (anything so he doesn't get sued lol). I might be being cautious so I'm not swearing to this time but just a guesstimate after chemo ends. Heal On Ladies! Heal On!",

I am only 47 years old. I have never had an issue with incontinence except when having bronchitis once a year and get to coughing so hard I pee my pants. I know from having a child you have to work on Kegel muscles, which I did and still do to this day. Today however, I was at the grocery store with my husband. I didn't feel that feeling when you have to go, but I felt a lot of pressure in my abdomen, next thing I knew I was soaking wet and very embarassed. I have treatment #3 tomorrow morning and will ask my MO about this. I am scared, I'm not ready to wear depends and hope when treatments end this goes away too. Thank you to any and all that can help. Hugzzz and Best Wishes to all.",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2013 08:00AM - edited Jul 30, 2013 08:03AM by RealityCheck Hi Ladies, I am beginning to lose the hair on my head. It started yesterday morning day 11 after first chemo treatment. Here is my dilemma. I went to the American Cancer Society Resource Center at our local Cancer Center for a free wig as I cannot afford one otherwise, after I saw my Oncologist and discussed treatment a month ago.  I found one the first visit but later decided it was just too dark for my skin color and I returned it. I went back twice to possibly get some help from a volunteer about ordering a wig that would work for me from the ACC but each time I went back no one was there and wouldn't be til the following week. All of this happened before my hair started falling out as I was trying to prepare for the inevitable. Now that it is here, no one is available again at the resource center to help me get a wig and I am not a scarf or hat person. I am to the point of no return on emotions for this one. I just want to cover my head with a pretty wig close to my style and color so I don't advertise I am going through chemo as I am just not ready to do that yet. I don't want the wigs they have available at the resource center as they are just too short, gray in color, white in color and short. I don't want a short one as I have longer hair. Can anyone help point me in the right direction to get a wig at little or no cost? Yes I have health insurance. Thanking you in advance. xoxoxxo",

Any Woman who is Independent and used to having control like myself, you find yourself unable to control anything in times like these. You feel frustrated, angry that you can't do much cause your so freaking tired, your stomach hurts, you get little aches that you never had before, your constipated, your sitting on the toilet cause your butthole won't close long enough to get off of it, your bald, you have scars you didn't have before and everytime you think you can have control it's like a slap in the face and you start all over. Your tired of hearing only three more treatments, two more treatments, however many you must endure yet. Your grateful for the little things like just waking up every morning and being alive to face it all again. I say to you Dear Breast Cancer Sisters - KEEP UP THE FIGHT! IT WILL BE OVER AND YOU WILL HAVE CONTROL BACK AND YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE FOREVER. This is my mantra. I am STRONG! I am ALIVE! I will BEAT this! I am BEAUTIFULLY BALD but my hair will grow back!

I've had a cold that turned into bronchitis and let's just say I couldn't cough without peeing my pants. TMI I'm sure but very annoying! Went to see Primary Doc last week and got an antibiotic and an inhaler. Was feeling so good this past week I have cleaned house, went through a box of photos that I've had laying around and got them into photo albums where they belong. If you knew me you would know I don't just stick a picture in a photo album, I write down occasion, person in photo, date it was taken, etc...I had those old albums where you opened the plastic page and stuck the photo to the white board and closed the clear page, remember those anyone? lol well my updated photo albums have clear plastic photo pages that you just insert picture into and come in different sizes and are easy to take out. So this has what has been keeping my attention lately. I was just reading about everyone and what they are dealing with in their lives. I send Big Giant Hugs to all of you Ladies!! Hope you are feeling better soon and staying tough to get through the next round of chemo. To the ones losing hair, I have lost mine as of last week, I have some really dark fuzz coming in but figuring in the next couple weeks it too will fall out as my 2nd round of chemo is tomorrow. If you don't know me I am a Type 1 diabetic and have started my steroids yesterday (Wednesday)...Needless to say blood sugars are over the moon!! Keeping blood sugar watch consistently and because at 2:39 a.m. central time zone my blood sugar was 350 after changing my infusion set in my insulin pump I can't sleep :( I have also noticed the steroid is giving me major heartburn, I thought this was a side effect from my first chemo treatment July 18th, I believe now it is the steroid as I haven't had my chemo yet but will in 7 hours or so. I have my tums handy and if they don't help Maalox or Pepto is on my shopping list after chemo treatment today if I am feeling up to it. Primary Doc says first treatment was nice to me and to be ready to be knocked on my butt with the second one...I hope to prove him wrong. He doesn't know how strong I am and even at my lowest I will not crawl. Just me, just the genes given to me. Anywho just wanted to check in Ladies and have missed you all. Hope to be here more often in the next couple weeks while laying down resting lol. Heal On Ladies, Heal On!! xoxoxo",

Had my second infusion and today is day 5 after. I am TIRED. I mean drag my butt, can't lift a finger to do anything cause it's just too much work. My mouth sores are back so I am rinsing, rinsing, rinsing, food tastes YUCK and the only food that even remotely sounds good is fruit snacks. Have eaten those little jelly gummies and feel like I'm in heaven. Hard to keep taking insulin while eating them but I really don't care at this point. Oh and the Prilosec OTC has been heaven too!! No acid reflux or none that I feel lol. I am drinking water only as I have been told by those who love me that drinking iced tea is not going to cut it. Well the iced tea tastes like heaven, water tastes like...water ya know? Yes I know the reasons for drinking water but I drank like five gallons last week during chemo treatment and three days after. I want the damn tea! So I'm sneaking it. I love my family, each and every one and I know they mean well but geez give me some credit for knowing what tastes good to me at this point. Ok off my soapbox. I have been reading about PET scans and bone scans...I don't believe I have had the opportunity for one of these yet. I had a scan before surgery to find my lymph nodes does that count? They shot my boob up with this dye stuff and waited like 2 hours before dye hit lymph nodes before surgery...when found I was whisked to the operating room. My Onc, Primary doc or anyone related to my case has not said a word about a PET scan or bone scan. I feel left out :( (Joke) If  I sound whiny and drippy nosed I'm sorry I just feel like a truck has hit me and just keeps rolling over me back and forth. I want my strength back. I want my independence back, I want to feel good for at least a little while. I don't want to wait until next week when wbc come back up. Screw that. I'm going to ask my best friend to sneak me a McDonald's mocha frappe. Good for the mouth right? LOL Love you all! Keep fighting the fight! Heal On Ladies, Heal On!! xoxoxoxox",

Hope all are doing a little better today, if not sending a hug of comfort and hope you feel better soon! Rambo - I feel your pain on the mouth sores. I've had them since first treatment. Used the magic mouthwash but had to get a prescription and that works a little better during the worst of it. My taste buds are shot. Food just does not appeal to me. NoCompromises - I agree we do need more postive. I am trying to surround myself with good things that make me happy and make me feel more like myself. I would like to come to the forums too and see good things. I know it's not possible all the time as we just need to vent and tell how we really feel, but when you feel good let it be known in the forums too. It may just brighten someones day and make them feel a little better through this process. Hugzz to all",

I started losing my hair Monday day 11 of first chemo treament. My mouth sores are healed and I am eating with no issues. No nausea, no diarrhea, no constipation (Aren't I just a freaking ray of sunshine?) DH shaved my head after dinner this evening. Everyone wants a picture. Why? Didn't they like me with hair? Are they going to frame it and have it sitting on their knick knack tables or hanging on the wall with other friends and family? Puhleasseeee. Let me get used to it before we call Olan Mills (remember professional photographer? Am I showing my age now?LOL) My next chemo treatment is August 8th and primary doctor says it will knock me on my behind. If that is the case hope you ladies are still talking to me and will be a shoulder or adviser. Big hugs to all and Heal ON Ladies! Heal ON!",

GraceB1 LOL on your other daughter running. Yes when it rains it pours but the storm eventually dies out and the sun shines! Karkar I have not experienced any body rashes like some of the other ladies. I understand it's an allergic reaction from the chemo drug taxotere. If I am mistaken ladies please let me know. I also wondered about how chemo drugs affect eyesight, you always hear the stomach, hair and wbc but hardly a word on the eyes. If it affects the whole body, eyes are definately included. Is it temporary or permanent? I myself am nearsighted and wear contacts or glasses. My glasses have bifocals...I'm thinking an eye appointment is due after all my chemo treatments have stopped.

I had my third treatment today and asked MO about the incontinence thing. He said most likely my bladder was weak at the moment and to just hang in there til treatments are over and see what happens. I do hope it's from the treatments and not going to be permanent. My RBCs were down a little and I have anemia, hence the sore legs when walking and being tired. Normal. I will be eating lots of dark green leafy veggies and eating more iron enriched foods to help combat this SE. Mellie, like you I had been drinking lots of water before treatment and I will again for a few days after as well. I did not know my bladder was full. I had no warning, no bladder push as they call it. I did have a little pressure on my abdomen and the next thing I knew WHOOSH! I have taken precautions now so it doesn't surprise me or embarass me again.  LOL Hannariggs on pushing the kids down,( I know you didn't push them down for real, but sometimes you just need to go to the bathroom) at least you knew you had to go!",

Marsha - I haven't had anymore issues with the incontinence lately so I am hoping it was just a couple times thing going on with chemo. Going out in public I wear a pad just in case to be on the safe side. NoComprimises - My eyebrows and eyelashes are starting to get really thin. I am so glad I have just one more treatment left. I am tired of being tired lol.",

Then dealt with heartburn every time I ate or drank something. Last Saturday went and had my hair cut (long) to a lot shorter but not too short yet as I was guaranteed several times by folks that my hair would indeed fall out. Woke up this morning with a cold and it's close to my Nadir time. Calling Onco tomorrow. Diagnosed May 28, 2013. My cancer is Stage 1b with one lymph node. Bilateral MX, Reconstruction with tissue expanders in now and full to the size I want. I am a type 1 diabetic. No radiation, expecting Tamoxifen after chemo and implant surgery after chemo is done. Hoping to have all this done by end of year. Just want to be here so you and I are not going through this alone and hoping questions are answered if I have them. xoxoxo",

Long story short I am wore out still. Can't get up for very long cause my legs give out tired. I have a question if anyone could possibly answer or know. My 3rd treatment is next week the 29th. If my counts are low will I have my treatment? I want to get them over with and am praying this tiredness goes away for at least a few days before my next treatment. I only have two left before I am done with chemo. I am reading the posts when I can keep my eyes open long enough and have so much respect for you ladies. Hang in there!! Hugzz to all.",

I'd just as soon get it over with and deal with the SE at home. I am resting and I do need to eat more protein. Nothing and I mean nothing tastes good. My taste buds are shot it seems. More eggs and peanut butter coming up! LOL Welcome to the group HVV! I have no clue what the black patches are. I was looking at my SE list for taxotere and cytoxan as those are the two chemo drugs I am on. What chemo drugs are you on? Maybe ask your Onc at next treatment? If you find out please let us know in case anyone gets black spots. Hugzz to all and hope your feeling good soon!!",

My husband kept telling me it was the chemo because anytime we walked together anywhere I would out walk him. I am so relieved! I will check with my Onc of course when I go in for my 3rd treatment next week but if you are experiencing it, then I am not alone. Not that I'm glad your going through it also but just so relieved it's not something more serious like blockage in my legs. 2bluestars - Your doctor is right. It will not hurt when he pulls them out, it's kinda scary how much he pulls out but it doesn't hurt at all. I had three drains after my BMx. I took the pain pills as I was just too uncomfortable without them. I only had the drains in 10 days and my DH drained and measured liquid for me. I was told NOT to shower due to my incisions, even though they were covered with sterile bandages and tape. I could do sponge baths, which is pretty much all I felt like doing anyway. I am doing reconstruction and currently have tissue expanders. After I am done with chemo I will be getting implants. Hope all goes well for you and don't be afraid we are with you!! Hugzzzz",
