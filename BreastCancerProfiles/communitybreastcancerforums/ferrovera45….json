I live in Norway and cant find a similar website over here. Its sad reading about all you have to go through, but I realise that it also helps a lot knowing that Iam not the only one facing BC. I started on 8th of April and will be having 6 rounds every 3rd week. My hair is falling off now, and Im trying my best to deal with it. I got really sick on round one, and having to travel with a train for like 6 hours back and forth to the hospital didnt help much.. This time I got some new anti nausea drug in my bag before the chemo. I pray that it will work! Im glad I found you girls and wish you all a non SE day :)",

The cemical name is pantoprazol, it slows down the pump that makes acid in your stommac. Ksusan, you look terrificðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ Getting new hope about shaving it all off â˜ºmy hair is 16 \" kopper red and has/had a lot of volume. But leaving it on until now at TX2 I hope has given my soul some time to absorb the fact that it will be gone, and that the long haired times are over....",
