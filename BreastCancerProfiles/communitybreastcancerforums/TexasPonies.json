They claim that they can't find a reason for the bleeding and have put it on the back burner as this is more concerning. Could there be a connection?",

I guess cagey is the wrong word but I don't understand why they wouldn't read me the MRI report, there was quite a bit of detail in there, like my BIRADS score.  Thanks for all your suggestions!

The reason the biopsy is taking so long is they said it needs to be done on day 7-10 of my cycle (same as my MRI) so I essentially have to wait a month from the time of my MRI I just feel like the doctors are so cagey and I would not have known any of my details had I not personally gone down to the imaging center and picked up my report.  MRI Says: No suspicious mass or suspicious area of enhancement is seen in the right breast, and no abnormality is seen on MRI to account of the history of right breast bloody nipple discharge.  I've done a round of antibiotics and a cream for the discharge but it did nothing, doctor says \"we can remove it if you want\" but that sounds elective to me. I am at Methodist Hospital in Houston,TX so I am assuming they are NCI recognized. I am considering getting a second opinion from MD Anderson but I don't know if that is going too extremes. ",

      "Content": "TexasPonies wrote: So far I have had- Mammogram (abnormal) Mammogram with spot compression (abnormal) --Then Ultrasound was recommended-- Ultrasound Done (abnormal) --MRI suggested-- MRI done (abnormal) MRI Report states: Clumped non-mass enhancement measuring 2 cm AP x 1.5 cm TR x 1.6 cm which shows a persistent-type enhancement pattern. Suspicious, BI-RADS Category 4. MRI-guided core-needle biopsy is recommended. This is in a similar area as the described mammographic abnormality on the outside exam. I know we are not allowed to post images here but my MRI showed an irregular shaped enhanced area with some smaller enhanced specs surrounding it. I can't seem to get a a clear understanding of what this means and my biopsy is on the 22nd so what feels like a lifetime from now. My doctor seemed concerned but is a man of few words and I had to personally call the radiology center to get the report so wasn't able to speak to the radiologist personally. I have strong family history of breast cancer (Both mother and grandmother passed away from the disease before age 45) so I am getting a little impatient here. Any help reading this would be really appreciated. Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
