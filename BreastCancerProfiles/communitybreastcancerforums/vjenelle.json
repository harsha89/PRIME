I'm 40 years old & I have two distant cousins that passed away in 2015 from breast cancer. No close family members like grandmothers, aunts, mom or sisters though. Not even first cousins. Since I tested negative for the BRCA gene, I asked the surgeon about removing both breasts. He said he would remove the cancerous breast and that I could get the other breast remover at a later date. I get the impression that he is just putting me off. So I'm taking the advice of the folks around me & getting a second opinion. The only downside to that is that I will be delaying the treatment plan that is already set in place. It scares me because at least 3 lymph nodes are already infected. The medical oncologist says that I'm in the beginning of Stage III.",
