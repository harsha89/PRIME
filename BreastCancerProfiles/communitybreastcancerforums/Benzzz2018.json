I came on here looking for stage 4 survivors over 9 years ago So people were saying that when people survive they just go on and live their lives. And don\u2019t come on here and share...so I\u2019m stepping up to say I\u2019ve been cancer free for pretty much the entire 9 years excluding a small cancerous lymphnode recurrence in 2017 to my adrenal gland it was operable. I\u2019m here to say through all my fear, anxiety and PTSD ... Im still here and cancer free. I just had to share. This is a long journey we\u2019re on. But it\u2019s doable. Sending hugs and positivity out here. Deborah Dx 5/6/2009, IDC, Left, 3cm, Stage IV, metastasized to other, Grade 2, ER+/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
