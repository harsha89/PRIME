I've met with my BS in person twice, and talked to her on the phone once. She's always been very responsive to my questions, and thorough in her answers, so I trust her. I'm just nervous. I've never had surgery before. I've had four children, all natural, so feel completely out of my depth with this.",

Lobular is so different and sneaky that the current recommendation is to get a mastectomy right off the back. It's hard to find on mammograms, US, and MRI's even, so they're moving away from recommending lumpectomies until the patient really understands how Lobular cancer works.",

      "Content": "MyJourneys wrote: I hope someone can help me think through the timing of things. I have multi-focal ILC, LCIS, ALH, microivasive areas in my left breast. All thought to be small, and all biopsies were too small to even grade. Because it's multi-focal, and lobular cancer, and therefore sneaky, they're recommending a mastectomy on that side. They biopsied my right side and found a small area of atypical lobular hyperplasia, but they say the rest of the breast looks fine. They want to do a lumpectomy on the right side when they do the mastectomy on the left. Then, if there's any evidence that it's something more than ALH, we'll figure out what to do afterwards. Before the ALH was discovered, they planned to do a lift on the right after the swelling goes down on the left (about 3 months) to make it better match the left, which will have an immediate reconstruction after mastectomy. One part of me says that we're going at it backwards... we should do the lumpectomy on the right, see what the pathology says, and if there are any signs of lobular cancer, the go ahead and do bilateral mastectomies and reconstructions at the same time. But another part says, do the left first, hope for the best on the right, and at least I'll have better use of my right side while my left is recovering. For those of you who have been there, what do you recommend? Thank you for your advice.

We're planning on an implant right now, and the lift 3 months later after swelling goes down so they can better match the left. They said that I'll have little to no disfiguration from the lumpectomy on my right. I think I'm leaning toward the implant/lift now. If I need radiation or something different down the road (if they find cancer in the right), then I'll have the option (hopefully) of a DIEP at that time for both breasts. Does that sound like a good strategy?",
