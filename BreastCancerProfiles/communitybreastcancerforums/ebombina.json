She proceeded with chemotherapy and was defeated by the cancer. It eventually spread to her brain which led her to brain surgery in order to remove the tumor. After successfully removing the tumor they tried to treat her brain tumor with chemotherapy for a few months, it spread to her spine, lungs, etc. She passed away after fighting for 1 year, passing away at 31 years old. My mother was diagnosed 2 years later (at the age of 34) with stage 3 breast cancer in the left breast. After her stage 3 diagnoses, my mother tested positive for BRCA1 & BRCA2. She immediately went for a mastectomy on her left breast, refusing chemotherapy and radiation. A year later, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer deciding to follow with a partial hysterectomy. 2 years later, a benign tumor was found in her right breast. She immediately proceeded with a mastectomy on her right breast and reconstructed both breasts from her abdomen. My maternal grandmother was diagnosed with endometrial cancer at the age of 65 and proceeded with a full hysterectomy. My grandmother completed radiation therapy for half a year. At the age of 18, I was tested positive for the BRCA1 mutation gene. Being too young for mammograms and MRI's, I simply didn't do any type of testing but self examinations at home. Just last year, I went in for my first breast & chest MRI, my doctor in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Hospital suggested I look into having a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy with nipple sparing followed by tissue expander. After a few months of testing, I decided to go with this procedure. I would much rather get this done and have the weight of possibly having breast cancer off my shoulders and conscious.  I am reaching out to anyone close to age range that had this procedure done and could offer any advice or suggestions. I have done a lot of research on this procedure and could only find woman as young as 30 (which is still very young, but was hoping to speak to someone at least in the early to mid 20's).  Any advice or suggestions from women who have had this specifically performed on them would help a lot. What to expect, how to cope, etc.  Thank you all very much and kindly.. in advance :) Log in to post a reply",

I am seeking any advice, suggestions or recommendations by you or your own PS's regarding the best scar eliminator or diminish on the market. My PS says he can't recommend any because he doesn't believe they work. Now, I know they won't completely disappear but anything to lighten and thin the scars will do jsut fine. Price is not an option. I heard great things about Mederma, Scarguard, Vitamin E oil, Bio Oil and Silicone scar sheets.. but am torn between all of them! Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
