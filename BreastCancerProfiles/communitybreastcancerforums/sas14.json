I won't have the results until Monday or Tuesday they said (uggh more waiting).  But the radiologist was somewhat encouraging and said she didn't think it \"looked like anything scary\".  She told me when I first got in there that if she had been the radiologist who read my first ultrasound, she wasn't even sure if she'd have ordered the biopsy. It is a solid mass that grew from .6 to 1.0 cm, but I guess the appearance is round like a fibroadenoma.   But the first radiologist told me the only way to know for certain is to biopsy it, so I am aware it could still be cancer. Thanks for the support!  ",

      "Content": "sas14 wrote: I am a 48 year old female, with a history of cysts (for many years now) and a fibroadenoma (when I was in my 20s). My breasts are dense, and very lumpy (I have as many as 12-15 cysts per breast at any one time). When I had my last mammo/ultrasound in May, they found a couple solid masses (via ultrasound, they don't show on the mammogram) on the left breast and told me to come back after six months for a recheck (I was a tad late). Had the follow up ultrasound today , and one of the masses decreased in size, but the other INCREASED from .6 cm to 1.0 cm in about 8 months. So now I have to have an ultrasound guided biopsy done next week, then wait close to another week for the results. I am a numbers person, and I know the overall number of benign biopsies is around 80%. BUT, I found a chart which breaks it down by age group and diagnosis (cancer, fibroadenoma, cyst, other benign), and the incidence of fibroadenomas is much lower in my age group (only 10%), and cyst can be ruled out based on the ultrasound results. Basically I'm left with 40% combined fibroadenoma and other, vs. 35% cancer. Almost even odds its cancer.   I am beside myself with fear and anxiety (I have an anxiety disorder anyhow), and would like some advice on how to get through the next couple weeks without making myself crazy. Thanks to all who take the time to read this and respond. Michele Log in to post a reply",
