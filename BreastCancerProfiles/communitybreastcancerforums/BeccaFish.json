I had the 4 A/C treatments, the 12 Taxol, 4 Perjeta and 1 year on Herceptin, and am now on Arimidex (I was only 39 at diagnosis, but I was put into a medically induced menopause to protect my eggs so that I can try to have children in a couple of years and then return to the Arimidex after, so my MO thought Arimidex was a better option than Tamoxifen.). I had a double mastectomy even though I only had one small tumor in one breast and wanted to be as aggressive as possible with treatment because I want to do everything I possibly can\u2019t to avoid a reoccurrence.",
