Achy, sore, tingly, etc.  Just recently I have noticed a large tender area on my right breast and a swollen/tender lymph node in my arm pit. I have a dr. appt in 9 days, then probably a mammogram.  Just worried that it might have spread to the bone? Does anyone else have arm pain?  Thank you.  Log in to post a reply",

She didn't feel any lumps or anything - and mentioned the tenderness could easily be from my new birth control pills I recently started. The achy, sore, tingly feeling is also in my right leg, so that is of concern. She gave me a referral to a neurologist and a brain MRI. Hopfully it's just a fluke but it's been going on for almost a year. At this point they are concerned with my brain or neck, not BC. Not sure which is worse. Maybe I belong in another forum now ;)  Take care! ",

I wake up at night with tingles, as if I'm sleeping on my arm wrong - but I don't think I am. The pain is dull, achy and concentrated in the forearm, but now I feel it on the shoulder/upper arm too.  I went to the doctor a bout 6 months ago for the arm thing - (Funny thing, I feel the same sensation in my right LEG. Achy, twitchy). The Dr. ordered a basic blood test to check my vitamin levels, everything was fine. Not checking for cancer!! I've been attributing it to a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel, but with the onset of this breast tenderness, now I'm freaking out. Was your diagnosis strictly BC? Or has it spread to the ribcage or shoulder area?  Thank you & take care.",
