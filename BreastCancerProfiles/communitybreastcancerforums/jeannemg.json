I received a call on 6/27/17 that the margins are not clear and that I need to go back in for surgery to remove more? Does this happen often? I am now second guessing my surgeon? Just upset that I have to go through the surgery again ugh! Thanks",

They also scheduled a Breast MRI on 7/3 to get a closer look. I am looking for advice on some important questions I should be asking of my surgeon? I have not yet met with an oncologist.",
