Thanks for the expander info...I am hoping to feel that exacy way.   I am also feeling like no one understands unless they are in my shoes. I never want to seem ungrateful for prayers, help and support but there are times when I feel like they could not console me enough...and it bothers me to feel that way. But this is part of it, I know.  Thank you HLB, very much  ",

When does one stop crying? I cry everywhere. More than I ever have. Supermarket, My daughters School, Washing dishes, 3am...anywhere it just spontaneously takes over. I am worn out, drained, and numb.  18 Years struggling with the unknown, Lupus. And now this.  Talk about curveballs (sigh)   My story: Bleeding from one breast, and clear leakage from the other for one year. Mammograms, Ultrasounds, Biopsy, AND MRI all negative. Therefore my doctor felt it was a normal hormonal reaction and they would just keep a close eye on me. Hmmmm...I did not like that anawer. I pushed for further investigation and did not stop till they agreed..August 21st I had a ductal excision of both. Results: Breast Cancer (oh and tons of uncomfortable sharp pains now) Diagnosed August 27th, I go to meet with my surgeon. I was so numb that I forgot to get a copy of my path report. But boy did I see it, clear as day. BC on the right, and tons of Pap's on the left.  It's almost like the Cancer was just waiting to grow....or be discovered. Wonder what would have happened if I agreed to just sit back and do nothing. smh Although it is early, there are way too many signs, risks, and family history to opt for radiation and lumpectomy. So Mast was highly recommended. My mom is a survivor....I was right by her side through her very long journey encouragining her, helping her, pushing her to fight, but somehow can't find the strength for myself.  Bi-Lateral Mast scheduled for October 5th, 2012 at 7am. Expanders will be put in.... Can anyone relate?

After waking from recovery, OH BOY! the pain, the stiffness and tightness in my chest was unbearable. Not happy about that. A I must admit I did panic. Right now what I feel is a very tight feeling, almost like bricks tied on my chest and cant raise my arms. I also feel a shortness of breath. I did not do well with Morphine drip, so I am now on Percocet. I spent 24hrs vomitting and still have a little nausea.  I am still afraid of the long recovery but love to see and read how everyone else is handling this. The advice is great and definitely helps me. I still cant believe I did it. I can now relate to all of you, you are all superheroes in my book!",
