I had my second bone scan since dx and I am shouting - no progression in almost 2 years and some of the tumors have gotten so small they had to keep blowing them up to show on the scan. WHOOHOOO!!! Report said treatment is working. (femara & zometa). I totally know what you mean about the changes in appearance and all. It was like I went to bed a semi- decent looking 48 years old with nice boobs (finally) and woke up 85 - fat - 1 boob gone - shuffling along. UGH! I told my onc that I would rather be a fat old live lady is better than a sexy corpse. But it is still hard to look in the mirror and see the me I am now - good thing tho is my memory isn't as good now so maybe I will forget the old me. LOL",

I realize it has to be done and who but you can do (we are all faced with this at times) - but you make me laugh when you write about it. Praying the acupuncture works - it will be good to know there is help for the pain other than the pills.",

I have felt so alone. 2 of my friends  have been diagnosed this year with bc and Praise God - both were early stage. They have both just finished their chemo and are moving forward. I am so thankful for theirs being found early - but I would be lying if I didn't admit that I wish mine had been found early also. I say this for many reason some that are readily apparent. But also because early stagers have all kinds of literature, information and support that I have not been able to find. I was diagnosed as stage iv with the cancer having already spread to my bones. I have had doctors that can't seem to understand why I never had chemo and friends and family that can't seem to get it in their head that chemo won't cure me. some people even think that because I have not had chemo - I must not be that bad LOL. Anyway - I am not trying to whine - it is what it is - I am just grateful to find a place where I feel there are others like me and I fit in. Thank you Ladies for your inspirational post and the way you reach out to each other - it is a blessing and a priviledge to read your post.",

Thank you all for your words - I was so excited about this site - I was trying to explain to my husband how wonderful it was to finally find other like me - I finally told him I had found a battalion of \"soldiers\" who even afraid of the battle just keep going out there to fight and heaven help anyone who gets in the way.",

Sorry to show my ignorance, but itseems that I have gotten more information on this Forum than from my doctors. I was dx'd January 30, 2009 with a phone call (screwed that Saturday up) and was told \"looks like you have breast cancer and it has already spread to your bones\". Lo and behold - that was found to be true after PET Scan, MRI, Needle Biopsy and finally mastectomy. I was told the mets were in my spine, hips and pelvis. About a month ago I had pain in my ribs and was told - oh yea you have it in your ribs - we just don't bother mentioning that because they aren't lode bearing. I was on tamoxifen until Feb of this year and then changed to Femara due to the hysterectomy I had in November. I have Zometa treatment once a month. The Femara has caused alot of joint pain and weight gain. It seems I went to bed a 50 year old and awoke 45 years older. LOL. Before dx, I had hip and back pain but thought it was age, arthritus, ect. I have had 4 PET Scans in all and each say \"there is no significant change - stable\". so I back to my question - am I dancing with NED or messin' with the stableboy??",
