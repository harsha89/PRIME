Right now they're telling you it's a fibroadenoma, and they've done the sensible thing and are monitoring it, so you're in safe hands and you're doing all you can. You can always ask your doctor if they would do a biopsy for you, to put your mind at ease? If it has grown that doesn't necessarily mean they'll remove it, but if they did decide to do that it's a very straightforward procedure. I'm in a similar boat to you, I'm 29 and just had a cyst drained and a biopsy on what turned out to be a fibroadenoma. I haven't had any information or offers or follow ups or anything, so I am going to chase them up and get it checked out again in six months to be on the safe side. Your doctors sound like they know what they're doing, you're in good hands! Try not to panic. Everyone in this community is so great, you'll always have people here to listen if you're worried and want to talk.",

What's worse, dealing with something that has a very high chance of being nothing to worry about, or worrying yourself sick over what it might be? There are a number of things it could be and the chances of it being anything bad are very slim. And like the others said, even if it isn't good news, finding it as early as possible is really important. Ignoring it isn't a good thing. Even if it's a cyst, they can be uncomfortable and painful until they're dealt with, and they'll just drain it for you right there and you can move on!Â  Also, I totally understand not wanting to tell anyone. I didn't tell my family until I had my results, so you should handle that part of it however YOU want to for yourself. If you don't want to tell certain people, then you don't have to! Do whatever you need to do in order to cope with this, but do get it seen to as soon as you can, and let us know how you get on!",

Like you, I really didn't have anyone to talk to and didn't want to worry my family unless I needed to, so I can empathise with how worried you are right now. Do nice things for yourself while you're waiting and distract yourself as much as you can. Sounds like you're in good hands and they've got things moving quickly for you, not long to wait for results which is good. Please do let us know how you get on!",

I'm the sort of person who always feels bad for making a fuss or complaining or being difficult, but in this instance I'm dealing with my health and wellbeing, so I guess it's fair enough that I just want to fully understand what I'm dealing with! Thank you. Are you chasing up more tests or waiting for future monitoring?",

      "Content": "Se82 wrote: Hi guys, this might be a bit of a ramble but I'll try and express myself as coherently as I can! Basically, I had a biopsy (fine needle) two weeks ago on what has come back as a fibroadenoma. I've been reading a lot in these forums because before last month, this whole situation was completely unknown to me - the fact that there are so many different breast cancers, cysts, benign tumours, and so on, I had no idea. While I was waiting for my results I was sharing my own way of waiting with others - try not to worry about 'what ifs' and try not to worry about any information beyond what you've been given until you know what the deal is. But the last week or so I've found myself getting worried after what I've read on here, like what if they're wrong? It seems that fine needle biopsies aren't the most accurate to have on a solid mass since they can miss so much. I think a lot of this is made worse by the lack of information by my doctor. They were brilliant at getting me a fast appointment for all the testing at the breast clinic (and it was a really nice clinic) - it was just a week between me finding the first lump (I found a cyst, and they found the solid mass in the other breast on the US, I didn't even know it was there until then) to having had a mammogram, ultrasound, and biopsy. However, they were slow with my results which came by letter, and the letter literally says, word for word (translated from Swedish): 'Hi! The analysis shows that it is a fibroadenoma and is harmless.' It is then signed by the doctor. That is ALL I was given, I'm not leaving anything out. And I mean...'hi!' How informal is that?! I am in the process of chasing them up and getting hold of all my reports so that I can take them to a doctor in the UK when I visit home at the end of the month, so I know all I can do is just get hold of the info, but right now I have literally no idea at all of how big this thing is, exactly where it is, or anything. I can feel something underneath the nipple that I couldn't feel before, and judging by where they entered with the needle, I'm unsure as to whether that's what they sampled or not. Boyfriend says it must be as they'd have picked everything up on the US which I'm sure is true, but still. Do you think I'm being silly and paranoid for feeling unsettled? Should just accept it's a fibroadenoma and move on? I just don't feel like I've had anything explained. I mean, if it wasn't for you guys, I wouldn't even know what a fibroadenoma was (or that there are different types), as the doctors here certainly didn't explain.They haven't said anything about future check ups, or anything like that. And as I mentioned in my other post, I'm concerned that he said I have a lot of 'rough tissue' in that breast, as I have no idea what he meant. I also still have quite a bit of discomfort two weeks after the biopsy, is that normal when it's just a fine needle? I'm sorry if I sound unecessarily paranoid, and obviously B9 results are fantastic, but I just can't help feeling a little bit unsettled and still a bit confused, honestly. Any thoughts? Edited to add - I literally just found out on the phone that my mum had treatment for something when she was just two years older than I am. I only spoke to her briefly to tell her what I'd been dealing with so I can ask her for more details, but apparently it was some pre-cancerous cells? I had absolutely no idea until now, is this likely to put me at higher risk? Log in to post a reply",
