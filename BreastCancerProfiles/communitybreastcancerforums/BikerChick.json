Everyone is different and everyone handles things on different levels. Feel free to PM if you want more info on my SE and ways to combat them. TAC is difficult, BUT it is do-able. And remember- the usual regimen is every three weeks for 6 cycles compared to the regimen of AC x 4 every two weeks then T x 12 every week.  Good Luck with your decision and do what is right for YOU as you are the one who has to live this!
