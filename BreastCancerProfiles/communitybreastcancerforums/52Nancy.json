Tomorrow I will be going in for a multi-view mammogram and an ultrasound.  My GP, who provided his copy of the radiology results to me, said, \"If you were my wife or sister, I would tell you to get a biopsy.  I will recommend it for you.  The only way a biopsy would not be possible is if the nodule is too small.\" I have seen there are several methods of biopsy.  Since it was reported my nodule is middle depth, is it likely my biopsy will be more invasive?  Does anyone know what this phrase, within the findings, means, \"... with an obscured and circumscribed margin in the left breast.\"?
