I'm past 4 years now and chugging along happily.  My oncologist and surgeon both told me that being Her2+ and being able to take Herceptin was a game changer for me as Herceptin is so effective.  Breathe deep...you have a long year and a half (or so) ahead of you....but like my DH said...treatment was really just a hockey season. My fear of what was going to happen was so much worse than the reality of it...maybe you can take some encouragement from that.  Taking it one day at a time was key...get up...go for a walk....go to work....go home...sometimes it's one minute at a time, but after a while, you'll be surprised that you get some \"normalcy\" back.  Keep your head up!",

I was in a support group with some stage 0 folks expressing their fear of dying with a lumpectomy and no further treatment.  I know it's cancer for all of us, I know it is terrifying to hear those words, but it's so hard to relate to someone who may have had to deal with the mess for 3 weeks when from stem to stern with the every three week herceptin and staph infection and reconstruction, I treated non stop from July of 2009 to December of 2010 and had 5 surgeries.  I am more understanding of the fear, but I definitely feel better looking at the stage III and IV forums with a bunch of girls kicking a$$ on a daily basis and living for years with strength and amazing humor.  You girls are where I go when I need to renew my strength, like the last 2 weeks when I had a funky bone scan but clear CT.  You are my sisters :)  Keep your head up through the AC's....I thought the taxol was a lot easier, if you have that coming next.  Mimi",
