A double mastectomy - my ex chose the size which I live with and hate (too big). I declined to do any further treatment. A year later mets to lungs and bones. My lungs and bones starting healing after only 2 treatments. I thought that was how it was supposed to be. I have spent the last 8 years doing various treatments. In August I had to do Whole Brain Radiation for around 40 tiny brain mets. My latest scan shows it worked. Enter my lungs, they are a mess. Both lungs have diffuse tumors, my right lung is partially collapsed, and I did 4 - 5 thoracentesis procedures this last year. As the fluid builds , so my heart rate increases, and it gets harder and harder to walk upstairs or move around. My last EKG was abnormal, so I see a cardiologist this week. The upper side of my right lung is puckered by a tumor. I am seriously considering putting in a catheter, so any suggestions or advice on that would be wonderful. Has anyone had a collapsed lung over a period of months, which they healed from? I did a test that showed that my type of cancer would respond to Ibrance (Palbociclib) - but I am ER- I am doing a lung biopsy on Tuesday, so hopefully, we will be able to confirm the hormonal status of this cancer. Sia - the singer, has a song called Alive - and yes she shouts - but she shouts - I am Alive, I am still breathing. Here's sending out the intention to all you wonderful ladies, that we'll all be breathing a long time into the future!!! Best wishes Fern",
