Hate to tell you, but be patient, you will be able to use your arm, but it takes several months. Your arm, by hurting, is telling you that you are overdoing it. I had all 10 of mine removed under my left arm last Nov 29, 2007 and my arm still hurts if I overdo it. I crochet, so I know that the repetitive motion will definitely aggravate your arm in the next months. I also make jewelry, and I am back at that, so I know you will be able to work your arm like you are used to doing, but you really need to give yourself some time to heal. Repetitive motions are not good for long periods of time. Also, be careful about reaching and lifting things. When I overdo it, my arm, shoulder and entire left side hurt for days, so be kind to yourself!  Do the stretching exercises recommended for this sort of surgery, and eventually it will not hurt all the time.  One month out is very, very early in the process. Hang in there!",

A couple blocks into the walk, I start feeling better. The longer I walk the better I feel! It's the Getting Started that is the hardest part .  Walking BRISKLY daily DOES work if you keep it up and encourange yourself to walk further as time goes on.  The keyword is BRISKLY.  Strolling doesn't count. You want to be able to speak while walking, but work up a bit of a sweat.  Portion control also helps. We Americans tend to eat way too much; our plates are too large. I was surprised to learn that a serving of pasta is the size of your fist, not a gigantic restaurant-bowl size which is what we're all used to.  Go for veggies, fruits, back off on beef, drink more water, and getting a good night's sleep is also important. Best wishes!! ",

HOWEVER, if you read things when you are more vulnerable than at other times, it can scare the dickens out of you. When I  am making myself sick with worry, I pick up a book my daughter bought for me at the beginning of my own journey with BC.  It was a blessing to me, and I keep it by my bedside.  \"Chicken Soup for the Breast Cancer SURVIVOR's Soul.\"  You can order it through Amazon.com and have it delivered right to your door. Full of little stories from those who have been touched by breast cancer one way or another in their lives. Some famous, some regular everyday people. You have a 'family' here, and trust me they will help you every step of the way. I have found that sometimes it is much easier to explain my feelings and fears to those who have walked before me in these shoes. My family, as loving as they can be (and you mentioned your sisters - I have one sister - my older sister - who has NEVER called me once during my entire cancer situation) is not always as sympathetic as I expect them to be, and maybe it's because now that I'm done with treatments they want me to get on with life.  It's not that easy sometimes, but I always feel better after getting encouragement from the wonderful people on this website. Hang it there! THOUGHTS BECOME THINGS; MAKE THEM GOOD ONES",

I know, it's hard to be positive for these things, but I'm glad you listened to your voice inside telling you to check things out.  The stereotactic procedure: the hardest part is laying perfectly still while they adjust and adjust and adjust your boob. Once they get that all set, you get numbed, and you won't feel a thing. We have a hotel in the area called \"Sybaris\" where only couples can go, \"swim\" in their own private pool, and...you get the picture. We call the stereotactic table the Sybaris table!",
