Its now been 14 days post and muscles are very sore and tight and lots of arm, left leg and ankle swelling! Is anyone else having swelling? Dr. Ruled out blood clot and we are trying low does of LASIX but no relief yet- also very tired body wise not enough to sleep but just rest. Good news kept 80% of hair with the CCC! Walking for 35-40 min everyday too? So glad this is over- but want to feel better!! Tips and advise appreciated!!! This round was worse of all- I guess it all added up!.",

I've been going to LE therapist, tried the LASIX (didn't work but was only 20mg daily) - resting with legs up- watching salt- and NOTHING is working. Drink over 72 oz. of water daily. Today right hand puffed out - and as usual behind both knees, left ankle and right arm (more than left) are still thick and tight. Need to start anti estrogen soon but afraid to add those side effects to these! Plus will be plane traveling in 2 weeks and yes will wear compression on all but so dated that too will cause more issues...",
