But she also had a very small tumor on the posterior section of her L5 vertebra (that's the last one down), and she had surgery to remove a small portion of the bone that had the tumor on it. Your post is timely since we also just received yesterday the news of her PET/CT scan done last week, 10 months after the spine surgery.  As in her first follow-up PET/CT from September, the radiologist noted some mild uptake at the surgical site, but did not indicate concern for malignancy, noting the uptake as likely 'chronic postoperative changes'.  I would have expected the report to indicate a greater level of concern if there was really any suspicion of cancer involved. When her original spine tumor was first detected by PET/CT early last year, an MRI was immediately recommended, but this time nothing - nor did her oncologist show any concern when we met with him yesterday.  My wife is due for a one-year follow-up spine MRI in April anyhow, so until then we're going to trust that the post-surgical activity is very likely the cause for the mild uptake.  If that MRI shows anything more serious, we'll deal with it then, but we have peace of mind now with our current status.  Other than that her PET/CT was clear, and she continues on with NED, which was actually her starting point since her surgeries last year completely removed the detectable recurrences of her cancer. In your case, I would get that MRI in a timely fashion if you think you need it for peace of mind, and until you get the results just try to remind yourself that no amount of worry is going to change anything.  If it's just post-surgical changes like everyone suspects, then it would be great to know that for sure.  On the off chance that it is cancer, it's better to know that for sure and so that you have the best chance of treating it appropriately.  The only thing you can really do helpful for yourself now is push for the MRI. Regarding other false positives, my wife had a tracheal lymph node with mild uptake on her original PET scan early last year - turned out to be nothing, and was probably due to the respiratory infection or bronchitis (still not sure what it was) that caused her to start getting things checked out in the first place.  Good thing she got sick though, since that's how we were able to discover her lung and spine tumors before they grew or spread further.  We thank our son's daycare for helping us give her a better chance at controlling this disease for a while.",

My wife was recently diagnosed in March 2010 at age 46 with recurrence of her breast cancer, for which she had a complete mastectomy in Jan 2002 with no nodal involvement.  With respect to the recurrence, there were two detectable tumors upon a thorough imaging workup: one 2cm tumor in the upper lobe of her right lung, and a single tumor <1cm on the posterior of her lower spine (only impacting the bone, and in a very accessible position).  Cleveland Clinic surgeons completely removed both the spinal tumor (April, laminectomy) and the lung tumor (May, lobectomy).  Microscopic levels of involvement of two lymph nodes within the resected portion of the lung were also determined after surgery, presumably spread from the lung tumor (as opposed to indicating a pathway to the lung tumor) since no lymph nodes outside the lung were found to contain cancer on biopsy.  She was declared NED as of the completion of her surgeries, with a clean CT scan and pathologically negative surgical margins.  The lung tumor was triple positive, like her original cancer, but the spinal tumor was extensively necrotic (i.e. dead) and could not be accurately typed since it had too few living cancer cells left in it.  She is currently on a 12 week regimen of Taxol+Herceptin, to be followed later by more Herceptin + Tamoxifen.  She is tolerating the Taxol very well, with hair loss and mild fatigue being the only noticable symptoms through the first 6 weeks.  Her case is an example of aggressive local treatment of oligorecurrence (or oligometastasis), followed by appropriate systemic treatment for her cancer type.  We'll see what the future holds, and of course we hope she's among those that achieve \"cure\" (or at least holding the cancer at bay for many years) for oligorecurrence.  Jeff",
