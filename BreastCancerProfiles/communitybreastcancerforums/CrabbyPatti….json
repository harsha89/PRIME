So I'm hoping my onc will have something to tell me tomorrow. It's funny but I'm starting to look around my house for stuff to give away so my husband won't have to deal with it when I die.  Well not funny but I'm sure some of you know what I mean. This seems to be the only place where I feel like I can say what I need to and there are others that understand.",

It's pretty depressing to see how many people are going through cancer but at the same time it's encouraging to see how strong you all are.",
