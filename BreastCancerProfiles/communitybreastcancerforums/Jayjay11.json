      "Content": "Jayjay11 wrote: I had a small red/pink spot on my left lowerbreast it seemed to be a zit at first, I scratched it and I believe I popped it and then it began to peel and now it's just a red spot it's now been there for at least 2 months it hasn't gotten bigger or smaller. My breast do tend to get swollen and tender about a week before my period and sometimes I feel more pain in my left breast but this is only before I start my period and or during then it goes away, but the red spot is still there. Any ideas what it could be? Log in to post a reply",
