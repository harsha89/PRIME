I'm so glad to have that part over with. I just can't decide what to do about the port. If it weren't for the flushing every 6-8 weeks, I wouldn't mind leaving it in, but that is going to be cumbersome for a year or more. What are your thoughts?",

Will I still need blood drawn for three month checks? I guess maybe the best thing is to leave it in for a year?  Thanks to all of you who have helped get me though this. :)",

I'm having the port put in, lymph nodes removed and the marker clips inserted on June 4th and then the chemo begins. That scares me, but since everyone seems to handle it differently, I will just wait and see. Thanks so much for your support. It really means so much. SusieQ",

We still don't have all of the test results back so I don't know if the tumors can be shrunk with chemo or if I'll lost the breast. I've already seen the oncologyst and surgeon, but without those last results (Her-2) for one - we're still in limbo. My only daughter's wedding is on the 23rd and the good news is I will get to attend before any surgery is done. I know that I will have to have a chemo pump and that really scares me. I still don't know what to do. I will probably try to save my breast if they think the tumors can be shrunk but then there's the radiation to follow chemo. There's been so much information thrown my way in the past week that my head is spinning. I don't know what to expect with the chemo. I've heard of women who went back to work and didn't miss a day and others who were miserable. I plan to fight the fight, but I'm still really scared. Thanks for listening out there!

It helps to know others have gone thru this and have come out on \"the other side\" stronger and a lot wiser. :)",
