I have been with a man that was not a very caring or kind person to me, he is simply a Angel to everyone else, and no one can believe me that he is so very cruel. I was already suffering from a pretty terrible depression when I got the news. My ex-boyfriend really didn't talk about it after that day. He never asked me how I was doing except for one day! I was literally shocked! I felt that there was hope after all! When he saw my face, he instantly knew that was my reaction, and quickly smiled, and gave me that \"look\" he wanted sex! The very first, and only time he ever asked me how I was I was so excited to think he actually did care, only to find out he couldn't care less about how I was, he was simply seeing if I wanted sex! After that day I was angry! I kept it inside. Growing, festering, everyday I would ask Eddie if they needed any help at the church he is re-modelling, I asked him for support from his church, I asked for a Turkey, or to go to the church, abd serve Thanksgiving, and Christmas dinner. Both times, he never asked, he never went out of his way to ever help me. Day in, and day out, I was at home. I quit working when I got sick, and found out later it was cancer. Some say that they don't feel sick, but I did immediately. Tired, anxious, and sick to my stomach. Eventually we became glorified roommates, six years together wasn't important enough for him to change. Leaving me alone everday to go to work, no car, friends gone. Now he is gone, we finally had the big one, he was gonna punch me in my face, because I misspoke a word he said. He is Mexican with a strong accent, and all I couldn't do was understand what he said. My three grandkids were here, he had only been home for 5min, I was serving my grandkids food, and Eddie got in my face, and counted to two, bawled up his fist, and said this is what happens if I get to three! I will punch you in your f'ng face! All because I misunderstood him! My three year old grandson saw his grandfather about to hit me, and begged him not to hit his grandma Eddie continued to fight with me, as I was trying to call the police, he had me on the ground, twisting my arm to get my phone from me, he grabbed my phone, threw it at the wall, it didn't break, I picked it back up to put it together crying hysterically, my grandkids were crying hysterically, a dinner uneaten by three small babies. The reminders of what was too be a normal night. Finally after begging, crying, and pleading he left, only to go to my mother's!! My mom has known for awhile that he was not very good to me, but I stayed so there wasn't much she could do. Than after all of this, he goes to the one support system I had, and told my mom about me always crying about my cancer, and that I was \"cancer crazy!\" That I flipped out, and was playing the \"cancer card\" he said. Now I am all alone. My ex Eddie is staying with my mom, I don't talk to her now, I just can't. I feel so betrayed that I cannot say anything without losing it! I am so sad, I have no friends, I am alone all the time unless it's one of my million of Dr's. I am so sad, and mad! I am so devastated that this is just a bunch of rambling, all I have is me. Alone, alone, alone, always. I have not been this sad since my son died 20yrs ago. I am sure this makes no sense, all rambling, no sense I just don't know if I can do this alone! Help!
