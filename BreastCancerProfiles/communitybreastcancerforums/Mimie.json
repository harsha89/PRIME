Don't know how long recovery will be and how long I should expect to be home from work (desk/computer tasks). I meet with RO this Wednesday, will learn about the 4 different types of radiation available. I hear mention of drains on this thread, don't know if I will have that pleasure (not!).

Took off dressing and showered last night, supposedly I'm glued together. Two days post op and really don't need pain meds any more.

After 5 hours of tests they found nothing. I spoke to RO following day and he recommended 600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. We were going on a 3 week Mediterranean cruise and the RO said to go. I was miserable. After the trip saw a cardiologist who ordered blood work (SED rate and C Reaxtive Protein) and echocardiogram. He thought it could be pericarditisand started me on a 5 day decreasing pac of prednisone. It helped at first but 2 days after I was finished it was worse. Echocardiogram was normal but blood work indicates severe inflammation so he consulted with MO, and tried to talk to RO. MO said it sounded like inflammation of chest wall and put me on 40 mg.of prednisone (hard to sleep on that dose). Down to 10 mg 3 weeks later and RO told cardiologist to add back the ibuprofen. RO said he didn't get anywhere near chest wall during radiation. I see him 12/28. This is so dipilitating. I can't exercise am fatigued. As others have noted lying flat is painful as is bending forward. I'm being treated at a major cancer center in Miami and my MO has only seen this one other time. They were clueless at the ER associated with the cancer center, and RO doesn't seem like he wants to step in and get involved",

I have the tea bags ready as well. Is there any particular soap you used for the area. I have been using Cetaphil since surgery, but noticed it contains alcohol, which my RO says is a no-no. TapperMom38 - thanks for your comments on fatigue as well. Running after a toddler sound much more exhausting than a vacation with DH, so I am encouraged. Mmb - I too am humbled by your daily trip for treatment, but maybe if you listen to a book on tape, or music while in route it will be manageable. Like the other comments: I'm not sure how to describe my current condition, but I like the suggestion of \"cancer survivor\". Lets not let this define us, just make us stronger.

I usually don't like taking meds with frequency as worry about the effects, but this time I blew caution to the wind. On another note a woman waiting for rad's yesterday told me I should be doing wheat grass and pomegranate as radiation is bad for the liver, and they will help to rid the toxins, anyone hear this too? And I finish tomorrow, and am traveling in 2 weeks, will I still be using aloe and emu oil, should I pack them??",

I asked how many more and he said 7. I asked for lidocaine and he said the Cancer Institute didn't have any. I told him it is liberally used upstairs in the Breast Center. He refused to get it but said I could get by with the markings and tape. Why didn't he offer this from the beginning?! I felt traumatized and was crying for days. I guess my guard was downas up to then every aspect of my treatment had been exceptional. All the caretakers were compassionate and concerned with my comfort level. DH called the hospital and my RO ended up calling me Saturday night to apologize. I start my treatment of 16 and 4 boosts on Monday. I'm really scared now.",

I think they check for range of motion, and healing of incisions. My RO recommended 100% aloe gel, 4x per day. It works fine, BUT need to put on at work 4 hours prior to my appt, and although it eventually dries it takes longer than I'd like at work. Any suggestions for an alternative at work that dries immediately",

First I met with the PA, when I described my symptoms, she said they were not known symptoms to the radiation, and made me feel like it was in my head. I felt so beaten down didn't pursue the issues with RO. Just gotta get through it. Its not unbearable, but I would have liked reassurance that what I am experiencing is normal. Jeisseebelle - I was told no cold compresses, would love to use that, as it helped a lot after surgery. Will ask at next weekly gab fest with my \"crack team\".",
