Update - my rad onc just called and said they irradiate the tail of breast tissue that entends up toward the armpit but they don't go deeply into the underlying tissues, just the top breast part.  That made me feel better.  I was glad she called back so quick!",

It also comes all the way up to my armpit.   After about 2-3 hours at work I apply a generous amount of miaderm or essential vitamin e cream.  When I get home I usually shower or take a not too hot bath and then apply a generous amount of emu oil and a clean tank top.  Then before bed I apply a lot of aquaphor (rub it between your hands to soften up).  I apply all over the breast, up into the armpit area and across the top of the chest.  That is my treatment area.  I also got a larger bra to wear over the tank top.  I got about 5 of the tank tops and use hot water to get the goo out.  Good luck, so far (crossed fingers) my skin is OK (just had #21 today)!  edited to add: my breasts are large and have not won the battle with gravity that's why I wrapped the tank top underneath - those still winning the battle don't have this problem!",

These are all numbers though and I agree with you that I don't have a real grasp of how they apply to me and my risk of recurrence.  You are for sure not alone in thinking about these things!!",

Maybe just looking at me with my puffy eyes, my few remining wisps of hair, distended tummy and tired movements will say enough. Oh well, maybe I am just thinking too much about round three on Tuesday. Ugh.",

As Michael Holick reported previously,we have learned that at most latitudes such as Boston, USA, very short and limited solar UV-exposure is sufficient to obtain \"adequate\" vitamin D-levels. Exposure of the body in a bathing suit to one minimal erythemal dose (MED) of sunlight is equivalent to ingesting at least about 10,000 IU of vitamin D and it has been reported that exposure of less than 18% of the body surface (hands, arms and face) two to three times a week to a third to a half of an MED; (about 5 min for skin-type-2 adult in Boston at noon in July) in the spring, summer and autumn is more than adequate. Anyone intending to stay exposed to sunlight longer than recommended above should apply a sunscreen with a sufficient sun protection factor to prevent sunburn and the damaging effects of excessive exposure to sunlight. ",

The book is nicely written and very informative.  They really present LE as something that can be managed if it occurs.  Also the speak up step out website has lots of information.  Two women here, kira and binney are both experts in LE, you can check their posts for information too. Personally I think all women who have had biopsy/surgery/rads treatment for BC should get a consult for LE and get followup periodically. ",

Heading home Wednesday on the red-eye flight.  Have one more boat/snorkel trip.  It's been just great to be at the beach, listen to the ocean and the birds, eat papaya, see the fish and coral.  I am ok with going home too.  I feel nervous about this part of our treatment as well, hence the tiki.  I still have herceptin until aug but then it's just tamoxifen and me and whatever lifestyle changes I can put together.  I am not sure which ones are best!  I know exercise is great but the diet supplement part is very confusing.   I sure am grateful to have you all.  This is my home group - I send you all a little ocean and a little ocean breeze today.",

For some reason I actually feel kindof glad about it, something about the early Aug date was bothering me, don't know why though.  So I will have a total of 18 herceptin treatments.  I also have another ECHO at the end of this week, that will be number 4.  Of all the things we go through the ECHO is a breeze!  I am missing my vacation I gotta say - I am just back into the deep end of work.  Other than that it's hot hot hot here, probably 108 right now.  HOpe everyone is doing A-OK.  Oh yes, and today is 1 year since I got the phone call about cancer and also 1 entire year of no alcohol.  That's pretty amazing since I do love beer - almost as much as coffee!",

On another note, I had an LE massage today for my side which seems to collect a bit of fluid - she put on tape to help, anyone else had that?",

I am not sure if that is what your NPis measuring but it soundedsimilar.

I told the guy that she hadn't really driven a car before and he basically took her out on the main road in rush hour traffic after only 30 minutes in the park/neighborhood. I was actually super proud of her because she held it together for the whole 90 minutes while feeling all the while like she was going to get in an accident. Needless to say we have cancelled the rest of the lessons with that company and just decided to take more time and teach her slowly.  Today we went out for the 4 time and she drove around for 40 minutes.  I think the clutch is giving her the most trouble but she'll get it.  Congratulations on reaching your weight goal!  That's great!!  I am still working on it.  It was a slow learning curve for me to figure out this menopausal body - I basically have to eat nearly half of what I used to to lose weight.  I am truely counting calories everyday now using the fitday download software.  It's nice because it also tracks nutrients so I can see where i fall short (vit D and E are chronically low).  I also can keep track of saturated fat (a baddie for my cholesterol).  Still doing weights and enjoying it.   I am on Arizona time which is the same as MST right now if you want to plan to be on at the same time on new years eve. ",

Either chemo brain has evicted it from the short-term file in my brain or I was never clear on it! Just wondering...is this the ER, PR, HER results? Is that what markers are? Lizzy -  When I think of markers it is exactly that , the ER, PR and Her2 results.  The markers can make a difference in therapy.  For example if someone is Estrogen Receptor negative presumably giving tamoxifen or an AI would not help them. Similary herceptin is gonna work for women who are Her2 positive but not those who are Her2 negative.  I am not sure how the 'degree' of positivity plays into this, for example someone who is 30% ER+ vs. someone who is 90% ER+, maybe someone else could talk about that.  There are some studies out there that combine the markers in different ways and estimate risk of recurrence for the different groups.  Then there are the molecular marker tests like oncotypeDX and others.  They provide more detail.  I didn't have one so don't know too much about it.",

I am reading 'The Emporer of all Maladies' about cancer and treatment through time and I have to pass along that it is very well written and super interesting.",

I can't take credit for the ethnic store idea - I read that good idea too, but now I can't find the post so I don't know who suggested it..... Iowasue -  I am about 5 days behind you, I noticed some hair on the drain today which I don't normally see - so its coming.  I have heard that hair does grow back while on herceptin just a bit slower.  ",

Well this morning is it completely land-locked!  I am checking my finger to make sure it doesn't turn blue!  Apparently my hands must be swelling during the night!",

Adolescents and Adults: Females age 14 and older: 150 mcg/day A 1/4 teaspoon of iodized table salt provides 95 micrograms of iodine. A 6-ounce portion of ocean fish provides 650 micrograms of iodine. Most people are able to meet the daily recommendations by eating seafood, iodized salt, and plants grown in iodine-rich soil. When buying salt make sure it is labeled \"iodized.\" About the vitamin D, folks with darker skin or tanned skin apparently make less vitamin D.  I tan really easily and when my onc tested my level it was 30.  I have been supplementing with 2000IU for about 9 months and last it was checked it was up to 36.   ",

While normal cells deprived of nutrients enter a dormant state similar to hibernation, the researchers saw that the cancer cells tried to make new proteins and took other steps to keep growing and dividing. The result, Longo said, was a \"cascade of events\" that led to the creation of damaging free radical molecules, which broke down the cancer cells' own DNA and caused their destruction. \"The cell is, in fact, committing cellular suicide. What we're seeing is that the cancer cell tries to compensate for the lack of all these things missing in the blood after fasting. It may be trying to replace them, but it can't,\" Longo said.",

      "Content": "Jan 24, 2011 07:05PM - edited Jan 24, 2011 07:16PM by Omaz Lil - I hope someone knows more than me!  As far as my understanding goes, if you are still having periods you have to take tamoxifen and not an AI.  AI's don't work for women who are having periods.  If your period stops while on chemo and you are of menopause age then they think your period won't come back.  But they could so for the first year the docs monitor your hormones levels to see if you are staying in menopause.  During that time you would take tamoxifen.  If you are truely in menopause then you can switch to an AI.  If you are already menopausal when all this starts you can go straight to an AI like arimidex.  For women who have not gone through menopause, taking out the ovaries will guarentee menopause and so you don't have to go through the year of tamoxifen. Some women cannot do tamoxifen because of clotting risks or other reasons. Tam and AI's work differently to deprive breast cancer cells of estrogen.  As I understand it, the tamoxifen blocks the estrogen receptor on breast cells but acts like estrogen on other non-breast cells.  The AI's block the action of an enzyme called aromatase which converts estrogen pre-cursors into estrogen.  In menopause estrogen precursors are made by fat and some other tissues.  Here is a link for more info: Whereas AIs reduce the amount of estrogen in the body, tamoxifen blocks a tumor's ability to use estrogen. Lil- I hope that helps.",

I did get an infection under my arm from the sentinel node biopsy that I had with the lumpectomy.  It did not become apparent until day 11 post lumpectomy and that delayed treatment a week while I did antibiotics.  Now it feels fine (thankfully!).  Were you thinking of getting a port? ",

Black cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) in tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients with climacteric complaints - a prospective observational study. Rostock M, Fischer J, Mumm A, Stammwitz U, Saller R, Bartsch HH. Source Institute of Complementary Medicine, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland. Abstract Objective.\u2003The antihormonal therapy of breast cancer patients with the antiestrogen tamoxifen often induces or aggravates menopausal complaints. As estrogen substitution is contraindicated, herbal alternatives, e.g. extracts of black cohosh are often used. Design.\u2003A prospective observational study was carried out in 50 breast cancer patients with tamoxifen treatment. All patients had had surgery, most of them had undergone radiation therapy (87%) and approximately 50% had received chemotherapy. Every patient was treated with an isopropanolic extract of black cohosh (1-4 tablets, 2.5\u2009mg) for 6 months. Patients recorded their complaints before therapy and after 1, 3, and 6 months of therapy using the menopause rating scale (MRS II). Results.\u2003The reduction of the total MRS II score under black cohosh treatment from 17.6 to 13.6 was statistically significant. Hot flashes, sweating, sleep problems, and anxiety improved, whereas urogenital and musculoskeletal complaints did not change. In all, 22 patients reported adverse events, none of which were linked with the study medication; 90% reported the tolerability of the black cohosh extract as very good or good. Conclusions.\u2003Black cohosh extract seems to be a reasonable treatment approach in tamoxifen treated breast cancer patients with predominantly psychovegetative symptoms. What does THAT mean???",

If you look at the survival curves in cancermath.net each time a person 'dies' in the graph the curve goes down a little bit (cancermath is mortality not recurrence risk I think, I wish they had recurrence). If the risk stays the same over the whole time period then it is a straight line.  I think of it like 100 people at the beginning and all are alive. Of the original 100 people:  At 5 years 93 are alive (93% on the graph) and 7 have died. At 10 years 87 are alive (87%) and 13 total have died    At 15 years 82 are alive (82%) and 18 total have died between 0 and 5 years 7 die out of 100 at risk, 7/100=7.0% between 5 and 10 years 6 die out of the 93 remaining at risk, 6/93 =6.5% between 10 and 15 years 5 die out of the 87 remaining at risk, 5/87=5.7% so it looks like the percent that die decreases over time.  Please let me know if this is not right!",

Some good news - I saw the LE specialist today and she said my arm was in good shape.  She thought this LE was limited to the radiation and when that heals up I'll be ok.  She said I am still at risk and wants me to wear my sleeve (which I get tomorrow) but things look good.  I think she was surprised.  I did the self-massage, guess I'll keep that up.",

I went back and described the problem to them, my LE therapist (who doesn't sell compression garments) also called them and they exchanged it for the correct size.  Much better now.  Good luck.  It isn't too much trouble to wear a sleeve, better safe than symptoms.",
