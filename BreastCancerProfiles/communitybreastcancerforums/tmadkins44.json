For the past month or so, I have been feeling a pulling sensation in my left breast, and a thickening in the left breasts. Kind of painful. So of course, I made an appointment to see my doctor, because in my mind, I should not feel a pulling sensation in my breasts at all. Well, needless to say, my doctor confirmed she felt a thickening as well in my left breasts. The next day I was scheduled for a mammo, they saw no big difference, just a slight change. As ususal their reply was if there is anything, we will call or you will receive a letter in the mail. I received a call three days later stating that they wanted to do an ultrasound because of overlapping dense tissue. Test were normal, but wanted to make sure. The same day I had my mammo. I felt another strong pulling in my left breasts. I felt were the pulling was, which was under my armpit, and my lymph node felt swollen. To make a long story short, after the ultrasound, the doctor came in and said she saw nothing that looked abnormal, which is great! But a part of me want to go even further to rule out everything. I know they said nothing, not trying to claim anything or want anything like cancer. But, want to make sure, sure, so that nothing will pop up surprisingly from it not showing up on ultrasound as well. Do you think I should ask my doctor what else should we do, or should I just keep an eye on it? Log in to post a reply",
