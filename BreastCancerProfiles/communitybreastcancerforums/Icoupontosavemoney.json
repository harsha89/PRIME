    "Content": "Icoupontosavemoney wrote: My stomach has been in knots for a few weeks. I am 46, had a routine mammogram about 2 months ago. The lady doing it said she had been doing them for 37 years, nothing to worry about. After the images, she said she wanted to have the radiologist look at them before I leave. He wanted magnification images. Again to the radiolosist to review. Next was an ultrasound, then the radiologist came in and did another ultrasound. As soon as that was done he asked if I could stay for a biopsy. They said I had 1 cluster of microcalcifications that had irregular edges and lots of calcifications. birads 4, suspicious. Long story short after waiting 5 days for results they came back B9. The breast clinic said the doctors would review the pathology results against the mammogram images and most likely have me come back in 6 mo. For an updated mammo. 2 days later they called back and said the radiologists reviewed the images again and want me to see a surgeon. Not what I expected having a B9 biopsy. So 2 surgeons said take it out, but wanted a MRI first. So now waiting for those results, then schedule the next surgical biopsy. I am trying not to think about it, knowing the percentage of B9 cases, but I can't seem to relax. Any advice would be great. Log in to post a reply",
