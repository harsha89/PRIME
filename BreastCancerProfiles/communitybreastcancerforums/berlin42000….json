I had cancer taken out too but high on her2 so am starting chemo in JUne for 6 cycles and herceptin for 1 year. Plan to do the cold cap. Is it tolerable? Is it really a constant brain freeze pain for the whole solid time? and if it only stays cold for 35 inutes how do you handle that. I bought 2 caps thinking I would switch to other one but that still onyl gets me alittle over an hour?? thanks.",
