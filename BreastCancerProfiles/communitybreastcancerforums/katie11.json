The only time I was given an expiry date was when I was first diagnosed with Stage IV from the get go.  A rather ignorant breast surgeon looked at my mammo and ultrasound scans and told me I had 2 years to live!  I hadn't asked his opinion.  That was 4 and a half years ago. Since then I've never asked how long the docs think I have left.  I am pretty sure that when things really start to deteriorate that I will know myself and, in any case, no one can really tell you how long- it depends entirely on how you respond to treatment. Only a few months ago, I was preparing myself for the inevitable when the disease suddenly took a turn for the worst.  As it turns out, I have responded well to the latest treatment and have managed a fabulous Christmas with my wonderful family. You are right to prepare yourself and get your affairs in order.  For the sake of ourselves and our loved ones, we all need to do that but try not to dwell on time frames.  Instead, enjoy every moment with your lovely family that you can take.  The decision to stop all treatment and turn to palliative care is indeed going to be the hardest choice we are ever going to have to take.  I like to feel - at least I hope - that I will instinctively know when enough is enough and will be at peace with the decision.  This is probably a fantasy on my part.  The one thing I have repeatedly said to my onc is that I am prepared to go on trying new treatments as long as there are options out there (which I know there are) and as long as my quality is life is good (which it currently is).  What treatments have you had to date?  If you let us know, we may be able to suggest alternatives to discuss with your onc.  Don't give up unless you are ready to and stay strong! You are in my thoughts! ",

Whatever the future may hold for me, I am lucky enough to have a wonderful life here and now that I enjoy, surrounded by people I love and who love me back.  I've learnt how to live more for the moment, enjoy simple pleasures and it's amazing how things that used to stress me out and anger me, be it at home or work, don't touch me at all now. Also, like CalGal, apart from those I am closest to, I haven't made my mets diagnosis general knowledge.  I find this ignorance much easier to deal with than the continuous worry and concern of others (albeit genuine) that can be overwhelming and all consuming at times. Finally, when the fear really takes hold, I have a good cry, a warm hug with my DH and I come here where there are other women walking the same path and really understand what I'm going through.  There are many women here who I have found truly inspirational. Hugs, Katie xx",

I haven't done a lot of research on Navelbine but have vague memories in my head of others finding it quite gentle whereas I have been finding it really tough. It's no wonder I've been feeling so run down and getting sick if my blood counts have been bombing like this with each infusion! I am going to just get lots of rest and try to recover. At least I continue with the Faslodex on Friday which helps me feel I am actually doing something. In the meantime, this beautiful spring sunshine beckons... Hugs, Katie",

Next steps are interesting as they are asking me to consider a clinical trial.  I don't know much about it yet and will be meeting with the onc on Monday to discuss but it will involve taking a pill which works by cutting off the blood supply to the tumour and therefore making it die,  DIE, DIE!! Anyone doing a trial like this at the mo?  I will post when I have more info.  Thank you again for all your excellent advice.  Seriously, what would I do without you all? Katie xoxox ",

Hope all goes well and keep us informed! Katie xx",

Good luck with the trial!  Eribulin is not yet approved here as a breast cancer drug but my onc did mention it is used with lung cancer and she thinks she can get hold of it for me, too!  I am also planning ahead! ",

The latest one was missing a couple of treatments of Navelbine recently when I had an infection and again due to poor blood test results. If you don't take a break when your body needs it, you put your general health at risk as our bodies can't fight off even the smallest of infections. Blood transfusions will help boost your blood counts and make you feel less tired. I've had a couple and always feel better as a result. Remember also that the chemo in your body will continue to work long after the last infusion.",

So, go ahead and don't feel guilty about it.  Once you've had a good old cry, a pity party and done a bit of inner screaming, though, it's time to pick yourself back up, dust yourself down and put your fists up ready for the next round. You can do it, sweetie, so stay strong! Good to hear you're getting out and about in the fresh air and enjoying the good weather - that's a good start. Take care, Katie",

I've been having trouble with board access all week since the upgrade and just managed to log in successfully now to find your message! I've heard some refer to breast cancer as a 'gift' before and personally I really struggle with this idea.  Though this journey has changed me in many many ways as a person and though some of these changes have helped me reprioritise my life in ways that I think have made me better as a human being, I would balk at the idea of calling cancer a 'gift.'  The bottom line is that it's a terrible disease that is killing many wonderful women on a daily basis leaving families devasted.  Gift? I think not. Oh, Wendy, I'm so sorry about Tyler!  Our automatic reactions as parents is to feel guilt when bad things happen to our children and my most painful emotional battles with this disease have been fought when I think about the possibility of not being there in the future when my children will need their mother at their side.  Don't feel guilty, Wendy - Tyler was not in any great pain and there is no way that you could have known that he had appendicitis.  You found out what it was precisely because you are a caring mom and took Tyler to ER to be on the safe side. I wish I was there to hug you, Wendy, but consider this a virtual hug.  Katie xx",

Nothing for it but to keep going and fighting. Stay strong - I'm right here holiding your hand.  Right have to go as I've just heard the dog opening the door of the living room - no doubt to enjoy the comforts of the new sofas in my absence!!

I am so,so sorry to hear about your new dx.  Cancer is truly crap!  It took me a long,long time to adjust to the reality of a stage 4 dx.  I found this place the ONLY place where people would really understand something of what I was going through.  Friends and relatives only come out with all that stuff about being strong and beating it because they want to believe that themselves.  They love us too much to admit other possibilities.  For this reason, I do my best to bite my tongue and be understanding,though it is really difficult at times. I have been living with stage 4 for over two years now and, believe me,it does get better and you do learn to live with it.  I heard someone describe it recently as like having a radio playing in your head all the time and that is what is like for me now 2 years on.  There are lots of treatments out there to control this damn disease for many years now and you will feel better once you have a plan in place. Hugs to you, Katie xxx",

I took a break of 3 months from chemo to undergo surgery (mast) as my mets were diagnosed from the get-go.  At the time I started the break, there was still evidence of disease in the bones but they were deemed to be stable which my onc says is just as good as NED.  After surgery and a break of 3 months from any treatment I then did another scan and guess what?  My scans still showed stable disease!

Is your mum ER, PR+?  Her onc may suggest starting with a hormone treatment if she is and this is not at all aggressive or painful. Hope the scan turns out to be B9 in any case; it could be just artheritis after all! Katie xx",

I recently went through an infection and progression at the same time and have never experienced fatigue like it. I gave up doing all my normal activities and just took to my bed. I slept on and off all day every day. The sleep wasn't at all refreshing but I couldn't do anything but sleep. I would fall asleep in the middle of 'conversations' with family. I can't lie - I had many thoughts about the possibility of just going to sleep and not waking up again. I welcomed the idea. I couldn't walk and I couldn't eat. I didn't even have the strength to turn over in bed. Yet, here I am sitting here now and things have completely turned around. There is hope though it's difficult to see any light at the end of the tunnel when you're feeling so bad as you are just now. What are for most healthy people simple infections can be absolutely debilitating to us and can take so long to recover from. What you need to do just now is rest and sleep. Just give in to it and allow the time your body needs to recover from the infection. Don't try and carry on as normal because things just aren't normal just now. Sleep and recover! Thinking of you!",

I haven't had so much trouble with pain but terrible issues with ascities, lack of appetite, mobility and weight loss. When I last had progression - about 2 months ago - I was bedridden and slept all day every day. I thought that I was going to drift away in my sleep. In fact, I had a few dreams that my time had come. I welcomed the sensation; it was peaceful and not at all frightening. But I started a new treatment (Navelbine funnily enough) and since then, things have just got better and better. Next week we are going on a family holiday! I don't know how things have changed so drastically but they have and I am happy to be looking forward to going on a family holiday. Stopping treatment is such a personal decision. I think I am too much of a coward to do it! Whatever decision you make, I wish you all the very best with it!",

Try not to look at statistics - they are out of date as soon as they're published and, anyway, you are not a statistic, you're an individual and no one can say how you will respond to treatment.  There are women who have been stable/in remission with stage 4 bc for many many years and are doing very well.

Whilst I feel we should be grateful in many ways for all the awareness and funds the 'pink' campaign has raised for breast cancer over the years, I also feel slightly uncomfortable with the subtle messages it tends to put across.  In the first place, the choice of the colour pink is an intriguing one.  We associate pink with a certain type of femininity which I personally can't relate to at all.  When you combine the colour with the almost celebratory atmosphere of the events and endless survivor stories, I end up feeling totally alienated from the whole process - like the ugly friend in an otherwise perfect line-up of beautiful people.  I just want to disappear into a dark corner somewhere so that I won't spoil the atmosphere at the party.  At these gatherings we are constantly reminded to make sure we go for early detection and never forget our yearly mammos when, in fact, so many of us here were diagnosed at such a young age and well before we were even supposed to be thinking about getting checked out. We are also spoken to about statistics and how many are now 'cured' and are 'survivors.'  I don't know, perhaps it's all my fault - I just didn't fight damn hard enough!",

The onc said they would normally change treatment when there is so much weight loss, but the chemo is working so well we've both decided to continue with it.  I would strongly advise seeeking the advice of a good dietician as soon as possible,  I've had one who's been able to guide me towards foods that I can tolerate and enjoy.

So, my question is:  What does a bone scan show that a CT doesn't and what will the onc be looking for on an xray that he can't see on a bone scan?  I know I should know this by now but ...

There is hope, but it's a tough emotional and physical journey that lies ahead.  You've come to the right place for support, though, as there is no one who will understand what you are going through better than the women on these boards.

The issue with Faslodex is that it can take a long time (my onc said 3-6 months) to actually kick in and be able to tell whether it is working or not. This has to be measured against how quickly the disease is progressing so the annoying thing about Faslodex is that you have to be relatively stable in the first place to give it a go. I've been doing the Faslodex shots for about 6 months now but in combination with Navelbine. Something's working though I don't know for sure what! Good luck and let us know what your onc says!

There is lots of hope for controlling mets these days.  My onc has never spoken to me about dying but always about his treatment options for the future.  I started out with an aggressive chemo combo of taxotere and xeloda which shrank, stabilised and obliterated many of my mets all together.  Now I am on tamoxifen - a hormone therapy. The others are right - you will feel much better when you have a treatment plan in place and are tackling this situation head on. Good luck and let us know how the rest of your scans go.

It's as if some feel they might catch them by just talking to you!  Silly! There are wonderful people on these boards with wonderful advice.  I don't have brain mets myself but there are quite a few here that do and are responding well to treatments.  BUT you don't know the results yet and headaches can be caused by lots of things including good old fashioned stress, which, unsurprisingly, is not infrequent in our situation!  I had a scare a year ago - problems with balance and hearing - but the scan came back clean and the symptoms were just a side effect of the chemo I was on at the time.  It's hard, I know, but try to hang on there until those results.  No point ruining your time now worrying about the future none of us are certain about!

If it is such an effective drug against pain, I don't see why it can't be legalised. Legalising it would prevent so many of the issues of criminality as well.",

Whether it's 2 years, 10 or even more, why spend that time focusing on the end?  Instead, I got up, brushed myself down and carried on with the much more interesting and exciting job of living.  Since my diagnosis, I've been on lots of fantastic memorable holidays with my two beautiful girls (they are now 10 and 12), I've also moved to live in a new country and started a new and exciting job. Believe you me, I know it is easier said than done, but go and have a ball with your kids on this holiday.  You'll never completely be able to put cancer behind you (it's flitting around my mind most of the time), but you can take back control of your life and get on with living again! Have fun! Katie xxx",

It sounds like your onc is really watching carefully and acting quickly though, so I hope that things can get back under control very soon. The decision to stop work is such a tough one. I gave up work 2 years ago now and, like you, my career and my collegues were an important part of my life so I really felt I was sacrificing a lot. I don't miss it at all now and in fact have relished the opportunity to spend more time with my daughters and try out things I just didn't have the time for before. I've been enjoying doing some writing (poetry and a novel) and creating in the kitchen. It sounds to me as if this will be a perfect opportunity for you to really enjoy that beautiful vegetable garden more! Someone on the boards recommended blueberry juice for keeping platelets up on Gemzar a while back. Perhaps you could grow your own and have the juice fresh! Hugs!",

I'll ask about the biopsy to check status, too! Again, thanks for all the really useful advice.  What would I do without you all? Hugs, Katie xx",

It is so, so difficult to plan ahead with this disease as it's impossible to know what's round the corner. Is there any chance of taking some immediate short term absence from work to give you some time to come to terms with the immediate situation? You also need time to gather all the information and reach some conclusions about where the disease actually is, what your treatment is best, how you feel and of course how you respond to treatment. It will also give you some time to be with your family. When I was first diagnosed with mets from the get go, I had one year off work. The benefits were almost equivalent to my salary so there was little financial loss. I did a grueling chemo regime and underwent surgery to remove the original tumor. By the end of that year I was stable and returned to work. Just a thought to buy yourself some thinking time!",

Okay, now I am really getting freaked out!   I most definitely don't need anything to increase my appetite as I eat like a horse already and do not want to pile on any more weight! Don't think the onc would have been looking at me yesterday and thinking I was wasting away and needed a boost with my appetite Last resort?  I think not!  I'm still working, laughing, playing and kicking!  I'm wondering if the onc is maybe thinking it's worth giving it a shot as the cancer is still in the bones only and though the TMs have gone up, there's no evidence of actual progression? The more I hear about this drug, the more I think it's a weird, weird choice for next steps! There are so many more conventional drugs that could be tried at this stage and I've only done one of the AIs!  Time for a second opinion, maybe? Jan - will be thinking of you on Friday when you get your scans.  Let us know how you get on! Katie xxx",

I still have the constipation though and spoke to my dietician about it.  She puts it down to the chemo and advices against taking laxatives.  I am happy about this as it tended to have the opposite effect and led to some embarrassing situations!! The dietician gave me the following advice for a more natural solution: 1. More exercise is essential for treatment of constipations 2. Eat calmly, do not skip any meals.  Eat preferably six small meals a day to keep the intestines working.  Eat at regular times as our bodies prefer regularity (biorhthym) 3. Eat at least 2 portions of fruit every day and no less than 3-4 spoonfuls of vegetables.  This should not include too many raw vegetables. 4. Products with active culture are good (yogurt, for example) 5. Drink at least 1 and a half to 2 litres a day. 6. Acidic and/or fibre rich products  - not too much - promote good bowel movement. 7.  Take your time when going to the toilet.  Take something to read in order to wait calmly for something to happen. 8. One good method to encourage to foster regularity is to sit on the toilet for 5 minutes every morning after breakfast without straining.  After a while your body will learn that the moment has come.  Place a foot stool under your feet. 9. Holding it up promotes constipation so as soon as you feel the urge to go to the toilet, go! 10. If you feel that you are getting cramps, go to the toilet but do not strain. 11.  After going to the toilet, allow your body to rest and do not eat straight away. 12.  Avoid fatty foods, chocolate, white rice, white bread, bananas, buscuit rusks, strong tea and hard boiled eggs. 13. Freshly squeezed orange juice can work wonders at breakfast and is also an excellent source of Vitimin C. Also drink the squeezed pulp. Also drink a large glass of warm water on an empty stomach. 14. For breakfast, a lice of whole meal bread with jam and a piece of fruit?freshly squeezed juice, dried prunes with a cup of coffee stimulates the peristaltic movement of the intestines. 15. You may also hae yogurt with muesli for breakfast.  A good muesli consists of various types of grains, dried fruits and nuts and seeds.  Always let the muesli sit for 15 minutes to give it time to absorb the liquid and makes it easier to digest. Adding fresh fruit makes the muesli more nutritious too. Choose mango, pear, melon, mandarin, strawberries.  Vary this breakfast with a breakfast of bread TIP: Brush your teeth after a breakfast of muesli and yogurt because the menthol taste of toothpaste does not go well with fruit and yogurt. 16.  Use laxatives sparingly as they make the intenstines lazy. I hope some of this advice helps.  It has certainly changed my life.  Before this, I was in hospital for 2 weeks for an intenstinal infections caused by the constipation.  Good luck! Katie xxx ",

There have been some posts on here that I have strongly disagreed with, I have also had some PMs that were more than inappropiate and very upsetting.  Do you know what I did?  I deleted them and carried on.  Though we all have breast cancer in common here, in many ways we are all very different people and, for that reason, it's perhaps not surprising that we are all going to encounter people whose views are very different to our own and even people we don't necessarily like that much.  Having said that,I don't know what I'd do without the love, warmth and wisdom on these boards and though I haven't necessarily visited every day as you have done,I have made great friends here over the past 2 years some of whom I've lost and wept for.  Don't give up on us, Steph.  Delete the message and come back where you belong.

It's good to see you posting again; I've missed you!  It's wonderful news on your daughter- this will take time but progress is being made and it really sounds as if she is herself now ready to move forward which is such a big step in the right direction.  With all of your continued, love, support and encouragement, she will get better! You and I have had similar experiences and disappointments recently and I fully understand what you are going through right now.  You may remember, a few months back I was also told that options were running out,  One treatment after another failed me, the palliative care team were called in and I was told to prepare for the worst.  Well, I've just posted the news I have got today which I hope will provide you with some inspiration and encouragement.  Taxotere is a drug I used in the past - about four years ago now- it worked then and, for the moment, it is working again now.  I was similarly shocked by the 'running out of options' statement.  I know there are still lots of drugs out there but I also realise that when one treatment after another fails and the disease is progressing, the doctors become less hopeful.  I think this is why they say these things.  It's horrilbe to hear, I know, but, it's important to be given the opportunity to hear it and have time to process it.  Having said that, things can and do turn around.  Look where I am today in comparison to just a few short months ago.  I am really sorry about missing the appointment about the possible trial because of the snow.  Remember it's still there for a future option, however, and, you never know, Taxol may well be the drug that works for you. Keeping you in my thoughts, Elaine, and don't be a stranger to the boards! Happy Christmas, honey! Katie xoxo",

As others have already said, though, there is lots of hope for all of us with stage 4 now.  I've never looked at the stats - they are out of date and no longer relevant to us who are being treated by so many new and better drugs.  I'm also doing great - though it's a bit of a tough ride emotionally, of course - I look fine and feel fine (no symtoms) and carrying on my life as 'normal.'  My onc has always said that stage 4 can be treated like a chronic disease these days and that it is possible to be in remission or stable for many years. You can do it, too, Kenna! Welcome and gentle hugs to you, Katie xx",

However, it is also only one of literally hundreds of books, theories and hypothesis about the recent alarming rise in the number of people being diagnosed with breast cancer each year in western countries. They announced on the news in the UK yesterday that the number of women who will be diagnosed in the UK with this disease has now risen to one in eight! Wow! They also put this rise down to many changes in our lifestyles such as diet, obesity, drinking, smoking, lack of exercise, blah, blah, blah... Whilst I am sure that all of the above no doubt heighten the risk of contracting the disease, they do not cause it and avoiding the above does not prevent it either. We have daily proof of this right here on the boards. Healthy lifestyle choices may lower our risks but they do not eliminate them and are certainly not some kind of miracle cure as suggested in Jane Plant's book. To suggest so is offensive, patronizing and a HUGE oversimplification of what is a very complex issue. It also very conveniently places the blame at the individual's door and fails to address much wider social and political issues. For example, anyone who has read Rachel Carlson's 'Silent Spring' will know the kind of thing I am referring to. I am so happy for you if the non dairy route has worked for you or that drinking green tea has cured your cancer or indeed if not eating red meat has saved your life. However, for every one who feels they have cured in this way, there are literally hundreds more who haven't. If only it was that easy!",

However, I don't think you've quite understood why your comments are considered insensitive and patronizing by many here. Both of your references to prevention as a cure and, indeed, Dr Weiss' column about diet are inappropriate on a Stage IV forum as theyseem to suggest that there is something we could have done to prevent the situation we are in. Equally, you also make reference to facts and statistics you have at hand that you could use to prove your case though you choose not to. This is also patronizing to say the least. However, I am an intelligent, well educated, well read individual who is perfectly capable of making up my own mind. Noone here is disputing the fact that diet plays an important role in this and, indeed, many other diseases that are growing at such an alarming rate in western society. However, whilst adopting a healthier diet may lower your risks of a breast cancer diagnosis, it is not going to prevent you being diagnosed and is certainly not going to cure you. As I said above, there are much wider and complex issues involved which reach far beyond the individual and what that individual chooses to eat. Apart from this, it is simply not wise or compassionate to come to a Stage IV discussion boards to effectively announce that you are doing very nicely, thank you very much, because of a book you read about a non dairy diet curing cancer whilst us poor souls are dying because we're obviously too stupid to realize what seems obvious to you.",
