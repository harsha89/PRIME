The pathology came back negative for both the SNB and the tumor itself, so I guess I should be happy. I was called to make my portacath appt. for removal. So I called back and was told to be NPO and bring a driver. They numbed me up and pulled it out, OMG. First off who made the freakin mistake about my appt being just lidocaine, and not conscious sedaton like it was to put it in. Then I had my simulation appt, first I could not find a parking place, then the elevators were not working, and finally they were running behind so I had to wait an hour and half. I read that sometimes they can use markers instead of tatoos, but I had both. I could not believe the pain from those freakin tatoos all 6 of them. I felt like a lab rat instead of a person. Changes need to be made about how we are treated for bc, maybe they assume with everything we go through bc patients can handle anything. I keep telling my self just 6 weeks of torture left, and then I can take control of my body. Sherry",

My Dr. says that I won't need emend or the nuelasta shot for taxol. Are any of you doing this? I live in Running Springs, Ca and we have had a huge snow storm, 2 feet of snow overnite. Thankfully I am not working right now so I can take my time shoveling. Before bc I could be outside for at least 4 hours, now after half an hour I am wiped out. The thing I hate the most is being tired, achy, dizzy all the time. I hope taxol will be a walk in the park. My eyebrows have thinned a little, eyelashes as well, but no hair on the body which is kind of nice. I still get emotional over little things. Every once in awhile I have a good cry then I am good for awhile. I am jealous of you guys that are taking a vacation, have a wonderful time. My DH and I plan to get away later on in the year. Thanks to everyone posting comments, I usually feel less overwhelmed after returning to this website. Goodwishes to everyone.",

So my Dr. ordered an echo and ekg, but I doubt anything will show up. The echo would have been done anyway because of the AC. My Dr. stopped the emend and neulasta and so far it has been okay. My biggest problem is my Hgb, each Dr. visit it keeps dropping and I do not want a blood transfusion. Anyone else have this problem?
