My oncologist actually went around to area surgeons and told them that if they had a case like mine, send patients to her first. I was diagnosed Stage II in Nov, started chemo in Dec, finished in Apr and had a single MX in May.  After the 2nd round of chemo you could feel the tumor shrinking. By the time surgery came, no tumor could be found in pathology. Nothing. I chose a MX after meeting with a Radiation Oncologist and looking at my options.(why not meet one, I am on the sandwich shop plan now..7 dr visits and the next ones are free..lol)  I really wrestled with my options, but in the end I knew what was right for me. You will too. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions!",
