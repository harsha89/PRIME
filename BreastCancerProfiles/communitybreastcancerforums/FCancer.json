However when I got there they told me I had a low grade fever and my white blood cell count was super high!!! I've been battling a sinus infection but didn't think I felt badly! So we have delayed until next week. I was so ready to go. Has this ever happened to anyone? I'm not sure how to stay well during winter chemo. My house is set with air purifiers and purel =) But I also have an 8 year old petri dish who bring home every germ from school. I'm sorry you are all going through this as well. hugs in solidarity.",

Also lower abdominal pain (ruled out yeast and bacterial infections.) Has anyone had a delayed allergic reaction to Taxotere? Thanks for your help! Kara",
