Last year I found an indent in my breast, but didn't feel any lumps so I left it alone thinking it was just a weird breast thing. My husband kept nagging me to get it checked out, so I went in to see a breast specialist. They saw the indent and said my nipple wasn't in the right spot anymore, so they did a mammogram, an ultrasound, and an MRI. They didn't find anything so they said I was fine and to just get yearly breast exams with my GP. It's been a year and the worry has come back. I still can't feel any lumps, but the wonder remains. They couldn't find anything in my breast that would cause this indent, but they were unconcerned since there was no lump. Am I being crazy still worrying after all that testing last year, or should I get a second opinion? I feel silly worrying about this without having any lump, don't you have to have a lump to have breast cancer? I just don't know. I usually just tuck the thoughts in the back of my mind when they creep up. Any thoughts or insights from you ladies would be awesome! Log in to post a reply",
