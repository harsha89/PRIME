I know this isn't something you go get a persription for and you're alright. This is hard and it just seems after watching the show do you take treatment and be sick for the rest of your life or just enjoy what you have.. What I have right now isn't enjoyable with this constant fear but at least I have a breast. I know you all are trying to make me think this could be a cyst but I have a hard hard area with lumps on top of it. The other breast feels nothing like this.",

With so many lumps and the size of them I'm just so afraid. You all have done so much for me and tried . I will go to the doctor I know I have to but it's just finding the courage.

He gave me some lexapro and xanax and did a quick breast exam. I was so upset and scared I didn't show him all the lumps or ask the right questions. I'm going back Monday and have him do a better exam. He's an internist and young so I don't know if he's done many breast exams but he said it could be fibrocystic but I don't think they know by feeling. I wish they did. I'm going back mainly to get a stronger dose of xanax cause the small dose I got isn't really working at all. No magic pills I know. I am just correcting that I haven't had the mammo yet but on the 16th. Sorry for the misinformation I guess I'm not thinking too straight.",
