I finished chemo on March 10th. I have little tiny flakes of skin flying everywhere! They collect in my car seat even. I have just been using Aveeno lotion. I finished 14 of 33 rads yesterday. So far only some redness under my breast. No fatigue. The further I get from chemo, the better I feel. So far rads are a piece of cake compared to chemotherapy! Best of luck to you all!",

And then there are the hot flashes! I have been having them for ten years and thought maybe chemo would lessen them. It has, but not completely. I think I will be ditching the hats and scarves as soon as i don't look like a cancer patient. Listen to me, talking all brave!!",
