Over the years since my initial bout with cancer, I have found no one, not ONE person, who has even HEARD of DES, much less may have been exposed to it! I usually have to go into the entire background about it. I know there is no way for any of us to be able to confirm that we would or would not have developed our various cancers had we not been exposed to this particular medication, but I was curious as to how many in this group might have been exposed. It's anecdotal information, for sure, but interesting to me nonetheless! PS: I apologize for not responding to your posts earlier, but there's apparently a restriction on posts a new person can make in any one 24-hour period.

I was just curious how many other women out there have also been exposed to DES during the years it was commonly prescribed to pregnant women. It's a sort of synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women as a matter of course during the 1950s through the late 1960s or so. It was as common as prescribing folic acid or iron supplements today and the belief was that it reduced the risk of miscarriages. Even if the woman was not at risk for miscarriages (like my mother), they still were likely prescribed DES during their pregnancies. In the early 1970s the FDA discovered a link between DES and various reproductive abnormalities, not only in the women taking it, but to the unborn children they were carrying. Further studies have shown that even the granddaughters have a higher risk for various reproductive abnormalities. Here is what one site says about it: \"More than 30 years of research have confirmed that health risks are associated with DES exposure. However, not all exposed persons will experience the following DES-related health problems. Women prescribed DES while pregnant are at a modestly increased risk for breast cancer. Women exposed to DES before birth (in the womb), known as DES Daughters, are at an increased risk for clear cell adenocarcinoma (CCA) of the vagina and cervix, reproductive tract structural differences, pregnancy complications, and infertility. Although DES Daughters appear to be at highest risk for clear cell cancer in their teens and early 20s, cases have been reported in DES Daughters in their 30s and 40s (Hatch, 1998).\" I was diagnosed with both uterine and ovarian cancer in my late 20s. My sister, born about 18 months after me, has had horrible problems with breast cysts as well as fallopian tube problems all her life. She was lucky to have her one son. I was lucky to have my one daughter. My mother ended up giving birth to 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls, but stopped taking the DES during pregnancy after my sister was born. My sister, me, and my older brother are the only three children who have exposure to the DES. We are the 3 oldest.  Speaking of my daughter, she, too, has had breast cysts and uterine abnormalities. She was diagnosed with CCA a year and a half ago just one year older than I was when I was diagnosed with my uterine cancer. She, fortunately, has 3 sons, so is not at all missing the organ! My mother was diagnosed with and treated for breast cancer about 3 years ago. She's doing fine. Now, her mother also had breast cancer, so there's something to be said for that. Still, though. I'm well aware of all the problems DES exposure presents and was curious how many women in this age range might have been exposed to DES in the womb as I and my sister were.

DES was not given to my mom because she had any risk factors or previous miscarraiges. In fact, it was pretty much to all the pregnant women in her area as a matter of course. The women didn't need to be at any risk whatsoever for miscarriage. It was just something the doctors added to the list of various things they required of their OB patients.  And, unfortunately, many women during that time never ever questioned their doctors. My mother thought it was a vitamin type of thing and did not even have any idea what it was really for. But, that's not really why I started the thread. I was just curious, anecdotally, what the incidence of DES exposure might be for some of us. Thanks so much, everyone, for sharing your stories.",

We were talking at lunch one day about whether I will get a mastectomy and, if so, double or single. I told her that I would definitely get a double, since it would be awkward to manage with one breast a 44D and the other. . . nothing. I then said that it would be a little different than hers, since she was much smaller. She looked at me quizzically and said, \"I had a mastectomy?\" Then  pulled her shirt out to look down and said with a laugh, \"Oh yeah! I forgot!\" ",

My husband and I just finished up our Chemo Boot Camp today with my nurse navigator from the Cancer Resource center. We spent several hours with her going over each and ever possible side effect and a protocol to help deal with each one. I'm so surprised they didn't warn you about the hyperness with the steroids! Yikes! I also had to meet with my family doctor/endocrinologist because some of the medications (including the pre-chemo antibiotic I was given) create glucose issues for me, one shoots my glucose levels up (will need use a sliding scale insulin those days), and the other drops my glucose dangerously low (the antibiotic, of all things!). It was an exhausting morning, but I was very glad for such fine-tooth comb detail. My husband was, especially. Now he has something HE can work with to help me out! He's printed up all sorts of sheets with checklists for each side effect! What a goober he is sometimes! I figure, if I expect the absolute complete WORST, and don't get it, then BONUS to me!!",

I know the hardest part for me when I was diagnosed was telling my daughter.  I know you are scared and it's always rough to think of the very real possibility that our good friends and moms may not be there as long as we had always thought they would be. The key for everyone is knowledge. The more you know about this foe, the more control you have. It's that sense of loss of control that can easily spiral out of control.  Take back that control. My daughter became a breast cancer researching monster!  All my best to you and your  mom and I know you will both come out of this stronger and closer than ever before!",

I would speak to a medical oncologist and discuss in great detail with the reports mean and what the prognosis is for the various options. My breast surgeon wanted to use a very conservative approach to my breast cancer. The trend today is for the lumpectomies and lymph node removals, then chemo or radiation or whatever else. The medical oncologist would be a good starting point because if the margins are not clear, you may well be looking at chemo regardless. But he can discuss the benefits or not of the mastectomy as well. Frankly, I would wonder what sort of background with breast cancer your surgeon has, considering he is so fickle regarding the two pathologists. That would concern me.  So at the very least, I would also look at another breast surgeon who has an extensive background with breast cancer, and, in fact, where breast cancer may well be all of his practice. The thing that both of you need is to feel that you have some control over what is happening. Even a little. It makes a world of difference.  Also, do you and your wife have copies of her pathology reports? If not, get them immediately. There are tons of resources on the web, and on this site, that can help you make sense of them. That way you will have a more concrete understanding of what is being said or recommended and why. Best of luck to you! You are her rock! Let her cry, though. Tears have a purpose, believe it or not, they actually draw out the hormones that make us sad and stressed. Let her sit down and have a good long, hard one, then gather up your weapons (your reports and second opinions) and hit this thing head on!",

Especially since, many years ago I did some research and discovered that something called \"pepperine\" is one of the higher level carcinogens. I believe it was placed higher on the list than tobacco. Pepperine is created in the body through digesting, breaking down, pepper once it's ingested. Additionally, one commercial use for pepperine extracted from pepper is as an insecticide. Pepper is one of the oldest spices and is in more things than you realize, including many brands of vanilla ice cream. Do I believe ingesting pepper causes cancer? No, but it would also take a great deal of evidence to convince me that it has any cancer-protection properties.",

I have a professor who makes it a point to request the \"new patient-extended\" office visit every time she makes an appointment with her gyno. Of course the appointment clerk alerts her that her insurance company will only pay up to the non-new-patient rate, and she is okay with that. There is a medical code for everything, and who you see on which visit, and how long that visit is is all part of it. I did not even know the \"code\" existed, but have since started using it myself. I make sure when I book my appointments that I book them for the one where I am actually talking with the doctor and for a minimum period of time (whatever or however that office codes it). It's what I call an \"end around.\"",

Depending on the location of the lump, it most certainly can not be there one month, then \"show up\" the next. The reality is that it was there for quite some time and under the right pressure or manipulation it is easier to notice. I checked my breasts every month in the shower for years. Sometimes I would do it twice a month. In early December 2009, I felt NO lump. On January 2, 2010, I felt one that ended up being over 2 centimeters in size. In January 2009, the lump did not show up on my mammogram. On January 4, 2010, (scheduled 2 days after I first felt the lump), it showed up pretty as you please. I'm sure many other women can share similar stories. So I'm not really sure what you are asking.",

If I've already posted this in this thread, ignore me, but if I haven't here's my perspective. I'm not wanting both off because I fear a REoccurence in my healthy breast, I want them both off because I fear that there is already cancer there that has just not grown enough to be detected. This cancer in my left breast was probably growing for something like at least 5 to 8 years before it showed up on a mammogram this year (it did NOT show up on a mammogram 12 months ago), and before I noticed the lump on my own in the shower before I even got the mammogram. So my concern is that there is already one in my right (so-called \"healthy\" breast) but we just can't know it yet. Even with more close attention, what if it's in a location that isn't as easily felt like this one was? What if it's in a location that won't be picked up by mammos as easily as this one was? What if it's not \"found\" until it's much further along than this one was? THOSE are the thoughts that plague me. That one is already there and just lurking. . . waiting. . . until my guard is down then wham. . ..  But I also know your ambivalence, too. My doctor keeps saying that he just wants me to make the choice I'm comfortable with, but he also keeps leaning heavily on the lumpectomy with radiation only, and tends to down-talk the bi-lateral.  So I feel like my family will think I've wimped out. That I am over-reacting and that I'm killing a fly with a cannon rather than a flyswatter.  In the end, I really don't care what they think, and I already know that there is no way to be 100% sure of ANY decision. But one thing I do know, I've made extremely hard decisions in the past. Life and death decisions. I know that once I make my mind up about something and excute on that decision, there is no room for regret. It forever is the best decision I could have made given the information and mindset that I had at the time of the decision. Once I make up my mind, it is what it is.  Good luck with your decision. You have to trust your gut, your own instinct. ",

There is a huge population of women taking the drug. There are side effects, but many are either common, not common or rare. The people who experience little or no side effects do not typically go around to internet sites and share their lack of problems. On the other hand, those people who hit the wall with side effects will. So it's a very very very lopsided view of the reality of the experience.  I had read some pretty scary things on here regarding radiation. When I talked to my radiation oncologist about those problems, he acknowledged that he had seen a handful of cases in his many years of treatment. Some he had only seen once or twice. Yet in reading on these boards, one would get the impression that the scary side effect was the average or the norm. That was simply not the case.",

Our bodies have evolved through much rougher environmental stress than we can even dream of today. I'm not saying it's nil, but I don't believe it's strong. On the other hand, I'm completely convinced in a very strong connection between inflammation and cancer. Many more people exist for years with low level untreated inflammation in their bodies, caused by a variety of things from what we eat to environmental factors.  For me I think the key is inflammation; and where stress may be a factor, I think it is to the point where it contributes to the inflammation. ",

Last summer, I was admitted to the emergency room of the hospital that is my \"In-Network\" hospital. My stomach was swollen and distended and I was in a lot of chest pain (I had \"frozen\" stomach syndrome, plus I was allergic to phenigren, which I had just a couple days before during a colonsocopy.) Anyway, I received a nearly $400 bill from a doctor that looked me over in the emergency room. I kept telling them to submit the bill to my insurance company. They already did, but it was rejected. Guess what? Out of the I-don't-know-how-many doctors in that hospital that ARE in my insurance network, this one doctor was NOT! Now I ask you, how the hell is someone supposed to KNOW that in an emergency situation, and why on earth would anyone even think to ASK, since the HOSPITAL IS in your network? Such a racket. Anyway, I ask every single doctor who comes into my room from now on who they are and whether they are in my network. If they don't know, I won't let them look at me until I find out. I even pre-screen the docs in the surgery theater before I go in now. Stinks.",

It's the generic name for Neurontin, which I took for probably 5 years or more for the same thing. I have had neuropathy for years. Probably 10 or more. It was the result of some lower spine damage from an autoaccident. The reason why those medications also show use for epilepsy and bi-polar is because they work in a different way than pain meds do. Neuropathy affects nerve conduction. Medications like that directly address nerve conduction issues. They \"calm\" the \"firings\" which can result in the odd sensations, the pins and needles, \"electric shocks.\"  In many cases the doctors will start you out at the lowest level to see if that is effective. If it doesn't work, it doesn't mean that the medication itself isn't working, it just means your dosage may need to be adjusted up. And the doctor should do that incrementally. My neuropathy was gradually progressive. Which meant that the dosage I was on needed to be adjust upwards from time to time. Sometimes when that happens people automatically think that they are building up a tolerance to the medication. But they are not. It just means that the neuropathy is progressing and requires a greater dosage. But because it works on nerve conduction, it does not really affect your mind, like some pain medications can.  I eventually started needing to reduce my dosage level and now I don't take any at all. I do get some periods of neuropathy back, but it's usually when I've been under a great deal of physical stress.",
