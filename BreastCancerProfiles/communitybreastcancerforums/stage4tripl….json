      "Content": "Aug 3, 2010 08:34PM - edited Aug 3, 2010 08:39PM by stage4triplenegsurvivor Pink Sheet Interview By Emily Hayes (e.hayes@elsevier.com) Avastin Reimbursement Worry Drives Patient Petition To FDA Patients with metastatic breast cancer who benefited from taking Genentech/Roche's Avastin are running a grassroots social media campaign, including a Facebook page and an online petition, to stop the FDA from withdrawing approval for that indication. The agency's Oncology Drugs Advisory Committee voted 13-0 against full approval of Avastin (bevacizumab) for first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer in July ('The Pink Sheet' July 26, 2010). A discussion on a breast cancer website led a 48-year-old woman with triple negative breast cancer named Christi Turnage to create the online petition, with the technical help of the spouse of another patient, on the \"Care2\" social networking website. The petition argues that Avastin has miraculous effects in some cases, such as in some women with triple negative breast cancer and that FDA withdrawal would amount to a \"death sentence\" for those who are responding well. The petition had over 2,600 signatures as of Aug. 2 and organizers are hoping to get at least 10,000. If an indication is withdrawn for metastatic breast cancer, insurers will stop covering the medication and patients will have to foot a big bill for the drug's cost, the petition warns. \"This medication is not being pulled for safety reasons. Current clinical studies show that it didn't extend lives as long as the FDA thought it should,\" the petition states. Avastin had received accelerated approval in 2008 with paclitaxel chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. But the ODAC committee decided that the progression free survival was not clinically meaningful and voted that the indication should be removed from the label of the drug, which is approved for a number of other cancers: metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, and metastatic kidney cancer. FDA will make a decision by Sept. 17 about whether to follow the committee's recommendations on metastatic breast cancer. In an interview, Turnage said the petition really started to gain steam after her 19-year-old son Josh on his own accord posted the petition as an event on a Facebook page and word started to spread. The issue then drew the support of Sen. David Vitter (R-LA), who expressed concerns that the recommendation for Avastin withdrawal was \"potential early signs of Obamacare rationing\" in July 30 post on his website. The senator noted that he had sent a letter expressing his concern to Richard Pazdur, director of FDA's Office of Oncology Drug Products. \"I was even more alarmed that the FDA's Advisory Committee may soon pull this drug not because of safety concerns but because of cost-effectiveness,\" Vitter wrote. \"The decision about whether patient should use life-extending drug is a decision that should be made solely between a doctor and a patient, not a government panel.\" Withdrawal May Not Deter Insurance Coverage Vitter asserts that a withdrawal of an indication could mean no insurance coverage from commercial carriers as well as Medicare. However, some patients have said that their insurers have indicated they will continue to cover the drug regardless of its approval status, as long as it is included in practice guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Furthermore, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recognizes off-label uses of cancer drugs that are included in NCCN guidelines. The NCCN is due to hold a webinar on treatment of metastatic breast cancer on Aug. 16, although it's unclear whether the group is now reviewing its guidelines. Grassroots petition aside, some official breast cancer advocacy groups strongly supported the withdrawal of an indication for metastatic breast cancer. San Francisco-based Breast Cancer Action, for example, agreed with the ODAC decision. A drug should meet one of three conditions, explained the organization's program manager Kim Irish. It should improve overall survival, and/or improve quality of life, and/or be less costly than available treatments. And based on the research, in Breast Cancer Action's view Avastin does not meet these criteria. Turnage argues that subset data showing positive effects for some patients might not be available but that the drug is clearly benefiting some patients. After a diagnosis with Stage IV triple negative cancer, she herself is now completely cancer-free on Avastin and said there are no treatment other options if she has to stop taking it. Poly ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors are looking very promising for triple negative disease but are not yet commercially available. An expanded access program is up-and-running for BSI-101, the PARP developed by BiPar and now owned by Sanofi Aventis, but it is only open to patients with no measurable disease. So ironically, Turnage said she is doing so well on Avastin that she does not qualify. Meanwhile, two of her friends who do have measurable disease are in a lottery and hoping they can make it into the expanded access program. Similarly, Lori Baur, another patient with triple negative disease believes her survival is dependent on access to Avastin. Baur recalls that when she was diagnosed with cancer with widespread metastases to the brain in early 2009, her doctor initially gave her about six to eight weeks to live. Baur said she is now doing well on Avastin. Doctors don't take a cookie cutter approach to cancer treatment, rather they personalize their practices depending on a patient's tumor type, Baur argues. \"Why is Avastin being singled out? It doesn't work for everyone but none of the drugs do,\" Baur said in an interview. What A New Label Might Look Like Genentech declined to comment on its plans for patients should FDA decide to go along with the committee's recommendation in September but said it will be prepared in the event of a withdrawal of the indication. One possibility is that FDA will not close the door completely on the metastatic breast cancer indication, and instead Avastin will be labeled for patients that are benefiting from or have previously benefited from the drug. That was the relabeling approach that FDA used when AstraZeneca's non-small cell lung cancer drug Iressa (gefitinib) failed to satisfy the requirements for full approval in a post-marketing study. In contrast, Pfizer is completely withdrawing its acute myeloid leukemia therapy Mylotarg (gemtuzumab) -the first product to be pulled from the market after gaining accelerated approval - and it will be available only through a treatment IND ('The Pink Sheet,' June 28, 2010). Mylotarg's problem centered around liver toxicity, however, not the weaker-than-expected efficacy seen with Iressa and Avastin.",

Komen for the Cure® Appeal to FDA and Key Lawmakers on Avastin Issue Posted by gmorales on August 12, 2010 Washington D.C. \u2013 August 12, 2010. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance (OCNA) and Susan G. Komen for the Cure® today urged the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to continue to allow the use of the drug bevacizumab, commonly known as Avastin, for metastatic breast cancer patients, noting that it is effective for many individuals. In a joint letter sent to the FDA and key Congressional lawmakers Thursday, OCNA and Komen for the Cure wrote \u201cwe are particularly concerned about patients who are presently receiving bevacizumab and the message that this decision sends about drug development for women with advanced breast cancer.\u201d OCNA is concerned that an FDA label change will further restrict access to Avastin for ovarian cancer patients. Many women with ovarian cancer are receiving and benefitting from Avastin, although its use for ovarian cancer is \u201coff label.\u201d These women face another worry: Medicare has already rejected some requests for Avastin, one of the world\u2019s most expensive but widely used cancer drugs. OCNA argues that Medicare and its contractors should pay for anti-cancer drugs that are listed on the approved compendia for Avastin. \u201cThere is a fundamental fairness problem when the law is not being enforced equally,\u201d says Karen Orloff Kaplan, CEO of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance. \u201cMedicare is obliged to pay for the costs of off label anti-cancer drugs listed on the approved compendia. We are concerned that a label change may create another barrier for treatment.\u201d Many doctors report patients taking Avastin enjoy \u201cbetter than modest results\u201d according to the joint OCNA-Komen letter to the FDA. In addition, a large scale Phase III trial showed an increase in progression free survival in women who used Avastin in combination with chemotherapy and as maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer. The decision to use Avastin should be made between a woman and her doctor after a thoughtful conversation that carefully considers its benefits and risks. OCNA believes that women who have the potential to benefit from this drug should have access to it. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance is the foremost advocate for women with ovarian cancer in the United States. To advance the interests of women with ovarian cancer, the organization advocates at a national level for increases in research funding for the development of an early detection test, improved health care practices, and life-saving treatment protocols.  The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance educates health care professionals and raises public awareness of the signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer. The Ovarian Cancer National Alliance is a 501 (c) (3) organization established in 1997. ###  ",

Speak now or forever hold your peace.....I am just finding out from so many women that their docs aren't telling them that avastin may be taken away, none of the chemo nurses seem to know. I have a friend who goes to Sloan Kettering and none of those nurses even knew....She had to tell them and she was the one who did testify on our behalf at the hearing. She said it was the hardest thing she had ever done because they had basically made up their minds before they got there that they were going to vote against it. ..................Don't forget to sign the petition if you haven't already...Here is the link again.....or you can always google avastin petition care2.....If you twitter, post it on there as well.....We have over 3,500 siggys so far....I am still shooting for 10,000, who do you know that knows a large group of people???? Please forward to them...  http://www.thepetitionsite.com/3/stop-the-fda-from-disproving-avastin-to-treat-metastatic-breast-cancer/",
