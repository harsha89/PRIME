And the biopsy is the only way to know for sure. Regardless of what the doctors think it is, I would want a biopsy for my own peace of mind. While driving to appointments and in the waiting room, I tried to breathe deeply and meditate and remember all the things I am thankful for (I even made a list on my phone so I could look at it whenever). And seeing all the other women waiting for their appointments made me realize that whatever the outcome, I won't be the only one. Things have come a long way since your father's mother's time, and each woman's situation is different anyway. And the bottom line is you're taking charge of your health--that can only be good for you and your family. I wish you the best.",

A lot of it is the skill of the surgeon and just plain luck. If she didn't get clean margins, she told me the second surgery would be a mastectomy. Best of luck with your treatment.",

In addition to reporting on breasts and lymph nodes (axillary, supra- and infraclavicular, and internal mammary), the radiologist also reported on my skin, bones, marrow, lungs, adrenals, and the top part of my liver (I am on the shorter side, so more of my body fit into the machine). When I entered the operating room for my lumpectomy, the surgeon was on the computer looking at the MRI images. I remember reading somewhere that breast ducts are too small to be seen with the naked eye. It turns out that in addition to the 1cm IDC, I had 2cm of DCIS, and the surgeon was able to get it all with wide margins. If she hadn't, then I would have had to then have a mastectomy. MRI does have limitations, as I found out first hand when after surgery it was discovered that one of my sentinel nodes had a micromet (1.5mm) that was too small to show up on the MRI (sensitive starting at 4-5mm). Since you are having chemo first, your tumor will probably shrink, maybe (hopefully!) completely, so that's probably why no one has ordered an MRI for now.",

During the actual treatments, the techs measured how deeply I breathed, and if I didn't hit a certain level as determined in the simulation, they wouldn't turn on the radiation. It's only been 2+ years since treatment, so I can't really say if it helped, but so far I haven't had any heart issues.",

It showed up on my annual breast MRI as a probable sebaceous cyst, and when my breast surgeon looked at it she could tell that's what it was, maybe because it was close to the surface of the skin. She said it's not a problem unless it gets infected, and of course right after I saw her it got infected. It got bigger and red and tender. She couldn't remove it until the infection went down, so I had to wait a few weeks for the procedure. I was given antibiotics and also told to try hot compresses on it, and it did get smaller. After the procedure I was told to watch out for signs of infection which included \"red streakiness.\" Even though the surgeon was sure it was a cyst, they send everything to pathology and the final pathology report confirmed sebaceous cyst with no malignancy found. It's good that you had a mammo and ultrasound, but like mjm1 I would also recommend that you have a doctor look at it, especially since it could be an infection.",
