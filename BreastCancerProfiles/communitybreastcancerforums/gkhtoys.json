UPDATE:  I came through the breast surgery pretty well but, I had breathing and lung complications.  They kept me overnight and I just got home a couple of hours ago.  The wire insertion was a piece of cake, IV went in smoothly but, the anesthesia was a different story.  I had low oxygen levels, light-headed and had a severe headache with the surgery.  I will hear the biopsy results in 1 week and 2 weeks will be the Dr. follow up.  Thanks for all of your helpful comments!
