A friend told me the Buddhists have a saying - \"live this like all other experiences.\" In the middle of all of this you can feel lucky - maybe it's early, maybe you have health insurance, maybe your friend has a brain tumor, maybe ...  whatever.  You can be lucky and it still sucks! If you talk to people you may find - as I did that everyone has their own story - themselves, mother, sister, friend, neighbor.  Often their reaction has more to do with their story than with you.  That's just the nature of things. It's OK to tell people, \"I really don't want to talk about it right now.\" If you can exercise - walk, yoga (very helpful to me), whatever, it helps. I found that the people I usually go to for support (husband, sisters) were the very ones who I didn't want to scare or have them know how afraid I was.  I saw a counselor once a month (and will continue for a few more) - it was great to have a place where I don't know her story, don't have to worry about what she thinks - it's all about me. ",

Although, I do understand the little nagging voice that says maybe I should have done the chemo - rationally though, I think for me the side effects -long & short term - outweigh the small increase in outcome. ",

Also, I'm worried about how chemo & radiation are going to impact me.  I hate being so washed out!",
