She immediately ordered a mammogram and ultrasound and told me that she did not like it. She said she was very concerned due to shape, edges, location and the fullness sensation I have. I will have the exams tomorrow, but I'm kind of freaking out. I am 42 with 2 boys(8&9 years old). I just don't know what to expect. Any suggestions? Log in to post a reply",
