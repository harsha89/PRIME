I was a little tired but now - 2 1/2 weeks after the last treatment, I'm well on my way back to normal! YES! I still have a little discoloration but no discomfort. My doctor gave me some Triamcinolone 0.1% cream for the rash I was developing. Used it right after the rad and also at night (before moisturizing). Stopped using that a week after rads. I used Cetaphil moisturizing cream very often, too. Maybe three or four times a day. Each night I put on thick Vitamin E oil (it is sticky but worth it). I only washed my breast twice a day. Morning before treatment and in the evening and I was very gentle. Not too hot on the showers seemed to help, too. I am still going to be taking Anastrozole every day for a few years. Checking with mammograms and keeping an eye on my bone density will be important, but it feels great to be getting on with my life. Thanks for your support here! (I'll do a cc to the Spring 2015 group)",
