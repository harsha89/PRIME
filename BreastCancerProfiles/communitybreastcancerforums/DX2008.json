I can definately feel one (about 2 cm) myself. A few days ago, I felt something like a thin cord running across in my right axilla area.  I have occasional pain in my outer upper chest (my tumor is in right inner upper quadrant) and tingling sensation running down my right arm, which was more noticeable fefore I notice the cord. Needless to say, I don't have any cords in my left axilla. Is cording (AKA axillary web syndrome) even possible before mastectomy?  Has anyone experienced something similar before?

I don't know if lymph nodes stay swollen 2 months after biopsy though... I will be very happy if they indeed find out the enlarged lymph nodes are just reactive and not cancerous.  I guess there is no way of telling now and I just have to wait until mastectomy and final biopsy report comes out. Yours, DX",
