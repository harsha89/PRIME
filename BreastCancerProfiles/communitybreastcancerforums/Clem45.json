About 8 months ago I started getting shooting pains straight through my right nipple, and the whole breast itched, let it pass because I could feel anything else untoward and it was not there all the time. 3 months later my whole breast felt tender and swollen so I went to see GP, he did a physical examination and said that indeed my right breast was lumpier than my left so sent me to a breast clinic, the consultant at the hospital agreed with what gp said and gave me a mammogram. All clear and sent home with 'benign breast thickening' about 4 weeks later pain became constant and started interfering in my everyday life, if my arm presses against my right breast it feels very painful, if I turn over in the night it wakes me. my right nipple is also very sore and constantly feels like it has been pinched. went back to gp who put me on a months course of anti inflammatorys and evening primrose but made no difference. GP has referred me back to breast clinic. My right breast is bigger than my left but cant feel any actual lumps. not sure if I am being silly or there is genuine concern. Log in to post a reply",
