I would take a book or magazine at first until you meet someone. I met a wonderful woman who had the same treatment plan and days  as I did and it was much easier to pass the time talking to a friend. Sending prayers your way on Thurs.",

I decided to have a few close friends over and each one took a turn cutting my hair. My best friend shaved it all off. We had pizza and drinks -made it more like a ladies night. I guess I was lucky losing my hair didn't really bother me. I felt empowered--like the chemo was working and I was going to beat the \"beast\"",

I had numb feet and hands during chemo--Taxotere and AC. My hands are fine now but my feet feel like I am wearing an Iron boot. Sometimes it hard standing up and walking. Does this sound like neurapothy? My ono said she feels my foot pain is not a side effect from chemo or Herceptin and wants me to see a neurologist. Any advise?

As you girls know those feelings are hard to come by during treatment,surgery etc. Now I play the song when I need a boost or a giggle.",
