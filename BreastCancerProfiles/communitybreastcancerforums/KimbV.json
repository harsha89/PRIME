I didn't worry about it too much as I figured it could be just changes or a cyst, however I decided I would bring it up at my annual physical. My physician did a breast exam and didn't feel anything I also semi regularly do my own exam and feel general normal lumps I have always felt nothing noticeable. She decided to order a Mamo which was my first. Im 37 with no family history. After the radiologist requested I have an ultrasound of both breasts and I did while on the table my nipple was inverted and she took pictures while it was inverted in case it would be helpful to the radiologist. A few mins later I was brought to a room with a phone where the radiologist told me I have a 7mm nodule in the right breast and that it was considered very small. I asked if that was the cause of the inverted nipple and he told me no and that the nodule was on the outer portion of my breast. He recommended I do a repeat ultrasound in 6months which I scheduled an appointment for. Ive been repeatedly trying to get a hold of my primary to ask her opinion on it but have not gotten in touch with her. My question really is do I listen to this radiologist or do I push to find an answer now? My other question is because he called it a nodule was he able to tell from the ultra sound that it was not a cyst? Thanks for any insight! Log in to post a reply",

In the mean time I've officially scared the crap out of myself as a few weeks ago I had bloodwork which included CRP that was 14.3, I didn't correlate it with anything other than possible vascular inflammatory condition which I scheduled a cardio appointment for but I just re-read it and now Im in a panic.",
