It's great that your doctors are moving fast in trying to figure out what's going on and making sure something's in place just in case! And as for the imaging, there are times when it looks to be cancerous versus not, although obviously the only definitive way to tell is by biopsy. On the imaging report, they usually rate it BI-RAD 1 through 6. Usually if it's 4, it's suspicious for cancer. If it's 5, they think it's very likely. So getting that report would be helpful in understanding what your doctors are thinking. Also, even if there is a high chance of cancer, only the biopsy can tell you exactly what it is and what is means. In other cases, there are also lumps that are not cancerous, but still need to be removed. So there may be various reasons they are getting you connected with the breast specialist. Hoping for the best for you!",

Before the biopsy, I asked the doc what my BI-RAD score was. He said it was probably a 5 although he didn't consult the official report (written by a different doc). I asked for the report to be printed and it said 4. Regardless, the report has a number of things that sound concerning, including pleomorphic calcifications in segmental distribution, and irregular with lobulated margins. Anyhow, not very reassuring overall, but just trying to prepare for the worst.",
