It seems almost like a completely different disease with me -- no pink ribbons, no you're gonna beat thies -- we are going to live with it -- some days better than other. My hope is to live with it with compassion. I also am not in favor of military metaphors for breast cancer.  Its sets up \"winners and losers\" for a disease we did not bring on, don't fully understand why it is in our body and what can be done to cure it.  I wouldn't go to war with that enemy!   My approach is for doing all I can to gain compaission and understanding of this disease, myself and others.  I do not want my obit to read that \"I lost my battle..\" - it's not my battle and I'm not at war...As many others have said, I'm living my live with breast cancer, and embracing  new opportunities along the way.  Other thoughts?",

You know, throughout all this cancer 'thing,' my experience is that there are a handful of friends and family members have perfect pitch when it comes to communicating their care and concern.  For me, I believe that intentions do count -- and if no harm meant, none taken and I work hard to accept the kindnesses and concerns of people as I know they are from the heart.    Life is a journey -- ours is a more difficult one for sure.",

I know everyone has their own requirements, etc.  As for work -- I have been in a rather high-stress communications role, so immmediately scaled back to 20 hours per week.  I am now out of that game entirerly and pursuing some writing and other projects that have been a life dream.  The thing that I find so odd, and frankly lonely -- about this metastic thing -- is because so many of us are not taking infusions (thank goodness) that the treatment is not as obvious to myself and the outside world.  Good right?  Of course, but I find I need to remind myself to take extra care -- diet, exercise etc -- as aside from the SE -- it is almost like taking vitamins for me.  I don't mean to diminish this -- just saying that without the routine of packing my infusion bag, donning my chemo cap etc -- I am having to take more care around the health and spiritual healing this time.  Not knowing what the future holds, I have decided to \"go while the going is good\" and that doesn't include sitting in an office cube -- and no -- our financial future is not set, but we are leaving this one to the universe this time.... Good luck with your treatment.  Does the above resonate with anyone else?",

With limitied options it improves your chances:)\"  So, all in all-- we must each make our decisions, but I came away thinking clinical trials can certainly be appropriate and have the added benefit of helping move science and medicine along.  Here is a web site you may find very useful; -- it covers more than UCSF and gives a good overview.  :  //cancer.ucsf.edu/clinical-trials",
