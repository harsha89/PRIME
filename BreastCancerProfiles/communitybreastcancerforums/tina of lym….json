Someone who actually could some up with a reason. So on these studies, we don't know the people studied, could they just have gotton le from the cancer/surgery and that's why they are ok to exercise and weight lift?  I have tons of thoughts on this. If any of you would like to join a lymphedema support group online, feel free to check my site out, www.lymphland.com the button to join the group is on the page.  We have lots of information on the site in other languages as well and a chatroom with live daily chats. No pressure, just thought some of you might be interested. I'm glad I found the message boards here, I've been on the site so many times and never noticed them! Nice to meet you all! Tina",
