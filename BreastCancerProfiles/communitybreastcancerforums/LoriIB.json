Most noticable when I raise my arms up over my head.",

When I took off the tape I noticed a long line/indent going down the side of my breast. It looks like my breast is deformed. Is this normal? I was also diagnosed with ALH, which I will now need surgery to remove. The line/indent feels like there is a string where the indent is.Â  I have read that simple biopsy are not supposed to cause any deformity. If this occurred with a simple biopsy what will happen then I have surgery! Did anyone experience this with a needle biopsy. They told me that the ALH is not cancerous.",
