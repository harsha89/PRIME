I've worked out religously for the last 30 years to stay looking good and I'm just not going to be satisfied to look \"bashed-in\" for the rest of my life (which I hope is very long!) Surprisingly, all the doctors keep saying what a \"good cosmetic result\" I have. If this is a good one, I'd hate to see a bad one. I know reconstruction will probably be quite painful, but I'll just have to tough it out. At least no rads after.",

But now, six months later, it's really filled in and lost the \"bashed in\" look. You'll also regain sensation in the breast which (I think)is lost completely. My surgeon said as long as he didn't have to remove skin, it would end up looking pretty good. I didn't believe him at first, but now I do, and I've changed my mind about wishing I'd had a mastectomy. Radiation isn't too bad either (at least it wasn't for me) so don't stress about that, either. My advice: I know it's hard, but don't be too discouraged right now, give it time. You'll be amazed at how much better it will get. It takes longer than you expect, but it will get better!!!",

But I want to tell those of you who are having surgery now not to get too discouraged. I know how painful it can be and how aghast I was at the appearance at first. Luckily the pain subsides eventually and my \"bashed-in\" breast is softening up, filling in and looking much, much better. So don't dispair, hang in there and there will be better days ahead.
