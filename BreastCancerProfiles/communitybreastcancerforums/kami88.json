I have been on Femara for 6 mo.  a lot of knee jt. pain, elbow pain, hands swelling, fingers stiff, trigger finger in the morning.. hard to get out of a chair.. stiff muscles. and increased fatigue.. I have increased Vit D, and on glucosamine and exercise. swimming is good and cycling, still working on it.. This post is old, so how are you doing now?   I am also on Fosomax, a bisphosphomate, for bone density.. help against osteoporosis and new studies out for less risk for BC.  ",
