It used to pop out, but now it never does. There is also occasional stippling around the bottom part of the areola. So, I went in for a mamo and ultrasound. Doc said he couldn't find/see anything, so just let them know if it keeps changing. A few weeks ago I noticed a oval lump with well defined borders that has stayed in the same place since I found it. Yesterday I woke up with the stippling around my nipple. I decided to go in to another Doc for a breast exam. She wanted me to go in for a mamo and ultrasound that day, but I had to work so I went today. I have very dense and fibrous tissue anyways, but you could see the shape of the lump on the mamo. Then we did the ultrasound. It was an oval shape, I really don't think it looked like a cyst, but it almost looked like inside the oval there was fluid and solid mixed, almost like lines. It is hard to describe and I can't find any images that look like in online. Radiologist said that he wants to evaluate it further and to wait for a call to see a breast surgeon/specialist. So, are fibroadenomas mixed like this? Maybe it is a complex cyst? I guess a biopsy is next, huh? I really don't think I am going to tell my mom yet, she will be freaking out. P.S. You guys are awesome Log in to post a reply",
