However, the investigators emphasize that modern radiation therapy technology now minimizes the radiation doses to the heart, lungs, and other breast, compared to the doses given at the time these trials were conducted. Comments \"These long awaited results from the EBCTCG overview analysis demonstrate an important effect for adjuvant radiation therapy in the treatment of primary breast cancer,\" says Abrams, noting that the survival benefit is apparent both in women who undergo breast-conserving surgery and those with cancer in their lymph nodes who undergo a mastectomy. The authors place their results in the context of combination therapy, and state that \"the moderate differences in 15-year breast cancer mortality produced by better local control can be combined with the moderate differences produced by chemotherapy and hormonal therapy...yielding in total quite substantial effects on 15-year breast cancer mortality.\"",

Longtime breast cancer survivor shares words of encouragement St. Petersburg, Florida -- 22-year-old Betty married her sweetheart, Frank Biscotto, back in 1954. \"Little did I know at that time what was ahead for me,\" said Betty as she flipped through her wedding photos. Almost four months later, their lives changed forever. \"I just usually sleep on my side and this particular night, when I turned over, I had such a sharp pain in my breast. So, I turned on my back and started to feel around and lo and behold there was a lump,\" said Betty. Within weeks, Betty had a radical mastectomy, radiation, and lymph nodes removed. This happened at a time when no one even talked about breast cancer or reconstructive surgery. When asked if she knew anyone else with breast cancer back then, Betty replied, \"No, not at that time. Not at all.\" But that didn't stop Betty from going to the beach and enjoying her life. She lives everyday to its fullest. \"We were determined that we were going to make it through. We prayed a lot.\" Now the 76-year-old offers words of wisdom to others. \"Your attitude has to be a positive attitude. That you're not going to let cancer take over your life. That you're going to beat it.\" Betty credits faith, hope, a positive attitude, and support from someone who made sure she wasn't alone in this battle. Betty pauses as she stares at her wedding photos of Frank. \"At that time, I didn't realize how special [Frank was] but, as time went on, he turned out to be extra, extra special,\" she said. \"Frank is my life. He's been my support 100 percent of the time... always there when I need him.\" After 55 years of marriage, Frank is still right by her side. He takes a moment to make a toast in honor of his wife. \"Here's to many more years together, Betty, and good health! Thank you Lord for all your blessings.\" Betty says she is the perfect example of how early detection can save lives. She encourages people to pay attention to any changes in their bodies, to do your monthly breast self-exam and to schedule your annual mammograms.",
