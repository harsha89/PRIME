It's not like it takes that much longer or it costs more to do 2. But since its already done it would cost more. My cancer was not found on mammogram and barely visible on sonogram and even then Radiologist suggested we wait and see instead of getting biopsy, glad we didn't go with his first recommendation. Then I did follow up Annual MRIs and found a new primary in the opposite breast 6 years later. Glad we didn't just look at the breast with cancer, or stop looking after the magical 5 years when supposedly I have as much risk as someone who never had cancer. The thing is this, doctors have an obligation to recommend what's considered standard of care. To recommend something not considered medically necessary to all patients would be an issue with the insurers who know the standards. But they can order additional tests, and their duty to insurers must be balanced by their desire not to get sued. If you had an issue there and your doctor refused to let you have a test that could be grounds for malpractice if you can prove you were harmed and they operated outside the standard. I think this may be a gray area. I find that I usually just need to be insistent. Wishing you benign results.",

Momx2 -- what are the tx recommended? Did you ask each onc about the other tx and why they recommend this one? My guess is they will cite a study, and explain to you why they are making the recommendation, and that will help you make a decision. If you have choices you need to understand what they are and be part of the decision making process. Cancer is not like so many other medical issues where the doctor just tells you what to do. It's about risk trade offs, and we need to be part of the decision about what risks we are willing to take for what possible benefits. Mellie289 -- what is your tx plan? Is it ACT over 8 cycles? If so I do think a port would be necessary. Also you can only use one arm since you had a lymph node dissection. If you get one I recommend you discuss where it goes. I hate that mine shows in every v neck when I've seen others put it where it can't be seen. Since your cancer is on the left they will put it on the right, which is great because it won't rub against your seatbelt. If I could have done without it I would. I hate my scar. Gma04 -- good luck today! rambo50 -- i worked through chemo on that protocol and drove without issues. It usually hit me 2 days later and lasted for 2 days, after that I was fine. The first dose of each new drug is the largest and has the worst effects. So even how you feel first time might not be the norm.",

Seriously. As for icing the head, there is a 1% chance of scalp mets and that risk is there with or without the caps. There are no studies that prove that icing the head increases your risk if scalp mets. Thats just deductive reasoning. Everything in cancer treatment is about risk trade offs. I'm doing the cold caps. I'm comfortable with the risk in my case. If my tumor were 1 mm smaller I'd be in a different risk group and might not need chemo. I truly believe my tumor is local and I struggle daily whether its the right choice to do chemo. At least with the caps I might not have to loose my hair again. I'm having so much anxiety lately.

I was very tired 2 days later for a few days and had terrible constipation from the steroids which caused an anal fissure that took a long time to heal. I also had a really bad reaction to compazine which took a few days to realize I could change drugs to something else. I did chemo on Fridays and was back at work on Monday or Tuesday. It really was not that bad, but also I was 37 years old. I think that being young and otherwise healthy with no other health issues made it easier. I am not in as good health now and it has taken me much longer to recover from surgery so I don't know how I will do with chemo this time.",

Now even though I have IBS I will proactively take Coalase if I get the same steroids because I know what they do to me. My biggest advise is to tell your onc about any discomfort you are having right away. Don't suck it up because some things can be fixed and you don't have to suffer. And that includes meds for anxiety and insomnia if you need them. I think the only real guarantee is that you will have some fatigue. One time it hit me while I was shopping and I could not drive myself home. But then that never happened again and I felt like I got a free pass.

I think it might be sinking in that this is really happening. Hang in there. For me the anxiety of waiting for results or anticipating the effects of a treatment is often worse than the anticipated event. I'm a week past chemo and I believe the symptoms I'm experiencing are prednisone withdrawal and not chemo related. I was on prednisone for 2 months to reduce swelling in my optic nerve which was damaged during my mastectomy and DIEP. I tapered off but probably too quickly. I've had a headache all week and no energy. It's probably multiplied by the chemo and my body is having a hard time bouncing back. I could take more prednisone and taper more slowly but I want off of it and I'm trying to tough it out. I lost 5 lbs in one week. My face is still puffy. I just want to look and feel normal.",

It's your doctors JOB to provide you with the information you need to make a decision. That said it does sound like he has explained that there is an area he doesn't feel is covered by surgery, and chemo is really for those stray cancer cells that might have escaped in your bloodstream. Radiation is a hassle because it is every day, but I found it to be pretty easy compared to everything else. I could get in and out in 30 minutes and met with the doctor once a week. Felt a little sunburned in one spot but no biggie. I respect whatever decision you make because in the end it is each one of us that has to live with the risks and trade offs.",

I may be totally wrong, but the moving pain was the reason my rheumatologist diagnosed me. TwoHobbies, congrats! no mo chemo! Ask the rad techs to who you exactly the edges of the radiation area so you know where to moisturize. I didn't do that and thought I knew how far it went and the area I missed the skin was more irritated. Sooo, I have TCH cycle 4 today. I don't know how I managed this, but I totally forgot I was supposed to take Methotrexate today, so I only took half the dose since its twice a day. I hope that doesn't mean i will have bad side effects. Last time I skipped the Zofran because it can cause headaches, whihc has been my worst SE, and I don't think I needed it. However I still got headaches. I talked to my boss today about returning to work before the end of my treatment. I'm asking for accommodations such as no projects with hard deadlines, work from home as needed, and keeping my staff member who has been acting manager of my team in the role until I finish with chemo. I'm sure they will accommodate me but I want to negotiate the expectations before I tell my doctor that I think I can handle going back to work.

Have not taken my fiorecet today, trying to fall back asleep. I only had carboplatin and taxotere this time, no herceptin. My heart function dropped 20 points in the MUGA scan, and while it is still is in normal range we decided to wait for it to come back up before trying again. It's annoying because it pushes the end date out, but at least it's only herceptin and I can get the other stuff out of the way. I'm planning on returning to work next week. I've been on STD since May for my surgery. I'm so bored at home, and I hope the time will go by faster if I have something to do. Friday night I started altering clothes, and I stayed up all night until the sun rose to do it. I was feeling the chemo effects starting and I figured I could sleep the day away and maybe not feel them at their worst. I have altered just about every article of clothing I own and purged what will never fit (this is my third purge since my surgery). I took about 6 inches out of all my knit tops and dresses, 3 inches out of pants and shorts. Some dresses were more tailored and had to make bigger darts. Now instead of dumpy and frumpy I have a new wardrobe that is actually flattering. Many of my clothes were an XL or size 14 or 16 and I'm now I'm a medium/large and size 8/10. Some of this change is due to weight loss from the past year when I had IBS and then went gluten free, and the rest is my DIEP surgery where i went from a DD to a B cup and had a tummy tuck. If there is one thing I can't complain about with this latest round of cancer, I love looking at the girl in the mirror. She looks like I did when I was in my 20s. I just wish she felt like her too. Echocardiogram next week. Hang in there ladies.",

My doctor said I needed to exercise so I forced myself to take a walk on the 3rd day after chemo and I've been walking further each day about an hour. I really do think its helping make me stronger. I'm thinking I might be able to go back to work in September which is great because my disability ends sept 30. I'm going to go visit my cousin who lives near the beach and enjoy a few days of the summer next week before school starts. That I am feeling well enough to do this is a huge difference from 3 weeks ago, so I really do think it was prednisone withdrawal more than chemo last cycle.",

One thing that really helped me make the decision to take the time I need is my director shared with me that his wife had ovarian cancer twice, and she took disability because her job was too demanding. He encouraged me to take the time I need and that the work would be here when I return. I don't know why, but it helped so much to have \"permission\" to take care of myself.

I did find at first that I was embarassed to have my head uncovered, but I was also so uncomfortable with everything on my head.  As I got used to not having hair (and everyone else got used to it too) I started going without cover in more places.  First it was just in my cube at work, then I expanded my zone to include the path to the printer, and later I just covered my head to go to the cafeteria or a large meeting.  Towards the end of my treatment I actually went shopping without a hat.  It was summer by then.  I think if it was winter I would have stayed covered more. RealityCheck - My gum is raw in one area and I have a swollen tastebud that feels GIGANTIC but is actually just one little taste bud.  I tried the baking soda and putting an ice cube right on the sore spot and it felt a little better the next day.  Yes ice cream feels great but I know what you mean about the sugar.  (I do feel less guilty stocking up on ice cream and popscicles!)  There are special mouthwashes you can get and antivirals if you have a history of cold sores.  If you think it's bad push to get the good stuff.  Have you considered sugar-free popscicles?  Personally I avoid artificial sweetners, but I'm not a diabetic so I gues you have to pick your poison.",

I would encourage you to research your reconstruction options. Many PS will only offer you the procedures the are comfortable with. If immediate recon is an option, it can have better cosmetic results than delayed. (Each surgery can create scar tissue.). I chose DIEP because I did not want implants that would need to be replaced or feel foreign. It's a longer recovery but I want to put this behind me someday. Also first time around I wanted minimal surgery, and had a lumpectomy. I wasn't ready to consider anything like DIEP then, and made the best decision with the info I had. There is a lot of information to consume and it can be overwhelming, but the right path for you will become clear. I'm 4 days past my third infusion and feeling rough. Bad headaches again that don't respond to anything. Food tastes nasty. I'll say I'm halfway done when the SE subside.",

It's probably decided based on your diagnosis and which study protocols your doctor is following. 6 years ago they did weekly herceptin for 12 months, but now they do it every 3 weeks for 12 months because they did a study that said it was just as effective and is a lot less hassle.

He knows its not possible, so why say that? Why would they prefer me to be on disability than come back part time and accommodate me so I can add some value? I'm sure I will contribute more part time than some people do full time, and he knows it. This \"we are concerned about your health\" thing is such BS. I can judge whether I feel well enough to work. I've been out of work since May 9. I'm sure I'm overreacting, but I really expected them to be more supportive. Also my doctor has not responded to my request for a doctors note.

Girl strong, the surgery decision is a tough one because there are so many choices and none of the, are \"wrong\". Six years ago I was told I was a candidate for lumpectomy. I didn't want to loose feeling and my breasts were large enough that I didn't think a lumpectomy would be significantly different. Also, I just wanted to be done with surgery and move on with my life, so I chose the lumpectomy. Well the tumor was a little larger than it appeared on MRI and the result was really was not attractive, but I didn't pursue any recon after my lumpectomy. Six years later I was divorced, and my body image was bothering me, but not enough to put my life on hold and pursue reconstruction. When a new primary was discovered in the other breast I immediately decided on a bilateral mastectomy. I knew enough at this point to know that immediate reconstruction was an option, and I definitely didn't want to wait 6 months for breasts. I chose DIEP because I didn't want a foriegn object in my body and implants are not permanent (they will need to be replaced in about 7 years). Also the DIEP unlike the more common TRAM flap surgery does not use any muscle, reducing the chance for hernia or decreased abdominal function. I had read so many stories of women dissatisfied with their recon or surgeons not comfortable with the procedure I had chosen, so I decided to go to one of the top great recon surgeons in the United States at the center for reconstructive surgery in New Orleans. It's not to say that you can't get a great result elsewhere. I had given too much of my life up to cancer treatment at this point to take any chances and I wanted it done now and I wanted it done right. My breast surgeon at VCU did not offer immediate recon, and the plastic surgeons he worked with did not offer DIEP. Many people who don't have the information I do after following this topic for 6 years can't understand why I would go out of state for surgery, but I can't imagine any other choice. But there is no way I would have been ready to take that path 6 years ago. I'm very happy with my result and I know it will look even better after my second stsge surgery this January. It's overwhelming now, but you will gather your facts, talk to doctors and survivors to sort out your choices, and the right decision for you right now will become clear.",

Lana, when I lost my hair in ACT I could not wear wigs, and only found one hat comfortable which was a tan bucket hat. At first people were shocked, but they quickly got used to it, and I got more comfortable with it too. I started not wearing the hat in my office, then I might venture to the printer without it, then I started going to meetings in my department. I would usually wear it to the cafeteria because there were 100s of people there, but I got to the point where I would shop without it. I just did not care anymore. I decided that I was the one with cancer, I'm going to be comfortable, and everyone else needs to just suck it up if they don't like it. Congrats to all those finishing up AC. my first AC and first Taxol were rough, but the subsequent doses were not so bad. It's as if my body got used to it. I feel like the same thing is happening with tht TCH. I have less days of fatigue. I met my hiking group this Thursday for a 5 mile walk in the city and I felt great! It's been so isolating not being able to do my normal weekend trips because I'm afraid I won't have the stamina to keep up on a long hike or kayak trip. I've been out swing and contra dancing a few times, and found that easy...and if I get tired I can just leave. I'm going to try to do more walking during the day when my son starts school and I hope that rebuilds my strength. It really does make me feel better. I want to get strong enough to consider climbing the 400 steps in the Statue of Liberty this November or December.",

As the follicles mature, the hair is replaced with thicker hair in concentrated areas, and thinner almost invisible hair in other places.  Some babies are born furry because the the follicles are less mature.  We see this process happen in adults if the follicles are stressed by chemo or malnutrition such as anorexia.  The condition is temporary.  You can help it go away by eating a well balanced diet. However if you are growing courser hairs in unwanted places this might be due to hormonal changes. Of course both could be happening. At first your hair might be thinner, or coarser, or grayer, or curlier, than you recall.  It takes time for your follicles to recover.   Waiting to color is good advice, but not advice I could personally follow.  If you can't wait do a test patch before doing your whole head.  You may find the color reacts differently to your new hair than it used to, and you may not be happy with the results. Also of course you want to hold on to every millimeter of new hair, but cutting off the unhealthy ends might make it grow faster and look better.  Don't put off that first haircut too long. You can invest in all sorts of fancy hair growth products, but I recommend inexpensive apple cider vinegar.  This neutralizes the ph on your scalp clearing up any scaliness/dry patches, unclogs pores allowing more hairs to grow, and closes the cuticles in your hair making it shinier.  You can dilute it in water and put into a spray bottle, or when your hair is thicker you can put it into a squeeze bottle or add to your conditioner or use instead of shampoo and conditioner.  So many hair products cause buildup and create more problems than they solve, problems that appear to require more product.  You need to be careful not to let it get into your eyes as it does sting.",

I participated in a treatment thread on youngsurvival.org starting April 2007 and those women were such a great support. I've met all of them in person and we keep up by Facebook these days. I'm the only one of that group to face cancer a second time. We found a new primary on my annual MRI in March. I had a double mastectomy with immediate DIEP reconstruction 8 weeks ago. I had planned to start chemo 4 weeks post surgery, but during my surgery I had a stroke to my optic nerve and lost vision in one of my eyes. I've been on a heavy dose of prednisone and waiting for the swelling to go down, and I am now coming off of that and adjusting to the change in my vision. I'll be starting TCH on July 10, and going every 3 weeks for 6 treatments, then continue the Herceptin for a year. I see there are several of us on this thread doing chemo for the second time. Gosh this sucks doesn't it? Sometimes I feel like I can handle this because I've done it before. I know how to navigate this. But now I know so much more, and the fear of all the things that can go wrong is causing me great anxiety about my decision. I had a very rare surgery complication, so its not so hard to believe I could be the rare minority that goes into heart failure or any number of outcomes. I also worry the emotional fallout ahead. I'm trying to take really good care of myself in every way I can. I'm not even afraid of the cancer. I've been through being afraid of that for a long while. I just want my life back and I'm pissed that it has been derailed like this again. I'm 43, single, and I have an 8 year old son.",

TwoHobbies -- My first cancer was 6 years ago and strongly hormone positive.  I started with Tamoxifen, then switched to Arimidex when the CYP2D6 test came out and I was found to be a poor metabolizer of Tamoxifen.  I stopped taking AI's after 5 years. There was some study that came out that said 10 years hormonal therapy is better than 5, but I'm not starting again.  My new cancer is not a recurrence but a new primary that is hormone negative so there is no need for me to start taking AI's again. Mellie - I think your oncologist will do whatever you ask.  They are not going to say, suck it up and go to work!  Likewise they will not tell you if you want/need to work that you can't.  I worked through it before, and it was not bad, but in the end that company went bankrupt!  I promised myself if I ever had to do it again, I wouldn't be such a hero.  I currently work for the state where my job is secure and I have a great disabilty program, so I decided to focus on my physical and mental healing and take the time off.  I've been out of work since my surgery in May.  I also think that whether working is realistic depends on your job.  I may decide to go back to work after I see how I feel through chemo.  Right now I am enjoying not even knowing what is going on with work and having no other responsibility than taking care of myself and my son. For those who have started chemo and are having a hard time, you need to know that the first time you are given a \"loading dose\" which is a STRONGER dose than you will get subsequent times.  When I did chemo before the first dose was always the worst, and now I know why!  It is possible that you may not feel as bad the next time.",

I had about a half inch of hair when I first colored it. It seemed silly at the time to go to a salon to color so little hair. I dyed my hair brown 4 weeks before this chemo to match my roots, but I was red for 25 years.",

If it was that small to begin with normally they would have done surgery first. Grace, sorry you are having the blues. It's very normal to feel this way at the end of treatment. You have to take this at your own pace. Congrats on reaching this milestone, even if you are not quite ready to celebrate. Soriya, if your BS only took 2 nodes they must have appeared free of cancer. The pathology will look at every cell, but it is looking promising. I hate waiting for path results, I hope you get yours soon. Mellie, I wish my brows and lashes would have stayed, I hate this look! People say I look tired...they know something is off but not sure what. Radiation does get old, and I'd imagine that if it was a long commute that would be hard. Angela, I'm sorry this has been so rough for you. Not working was hard for me too. I wanted to do more than go to doctors appointments. I would actually get dressed up for it because it was the highlight of my week...how sad is that? I hope you can return to your \"real life\" soon. Someone here asked about Arimidex, I can't find it now. Anyway I just want to say I was on it for 3-4 years and can't recall any side effects specific to the drug. So an update on me...I went in for herceptin today and my port would not work! They tried it several times and they think it might be turned over. I'm getting an X-ray on Monday to try to see what is wrong. I had to do an IV in my hand because that's the only place they could get a line (after 2 other stick attempts in my arm). I can't imagine what I may have done to flip my port...except I had a terrible cough a few weeks ago. So annoying.",
