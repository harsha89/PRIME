Did you get everything done on your to-do list? I kinda had to laugh at the list because I'm the same way. I've already been trying to get way too many things done prior to my surgery. Others have offered to assist me, but I know that if I do it all by myself, at least it will be done right...... or in other words, MY WAY!! Thinking of you all as your surgery dates draw near.",

I am blessed that I have a very loving and supportive husband and he shows me everyday what a true man is. He amazes me with his compassion and kindness. Do you deserve anything less that I have? Hell NO!! You deserve to have a life filled with love and you deserve to have someone in your life that you can depend on. Your daughter deserves to see her mommy happy!  He is not the one!! I am so sorry that you hit the breast cancer lottery like the rest of us. But I can tell you that in the short time that I have been using this board, I have gained knowledge strength and support from the wonderful strong ladies here. You are strong enough to do this and you and your daughter will get through this. It will be hard sometimes and you will struggle, but you won't be defeated. You and your daughter will remain constant and when you become focused on YOU, things will become clearer. Great advice from the above posters about financial assistance. Don't be too proud to use it when you need it. Your BF is full of hot air!! Maybe he shouldn't go to chemo with you as he would probably just tell the onc nurses that he knows a guy that can do that for you as well. He sounds exhausting to even listen too. I wish the very best for you and your precious little girl. Come here and vent away!!",

Since I'm triple neg and BRCA1 positive, chemo came first. I was on a clinical trial of chemo that made me very ill and spent more time in the hospital then at home until my chemo was finished in July. During that time, I had to get 26 units of blood as well. Good Times!! I had a bilateral mastectomy in August and then started radiation that I finished in December of 2011. Radiation was immensely easier on me than the chemo. I was feeling stronger but definitely had the \"chemo brain forgetfulness\" Being triple neg means that no scans are done unless there are symptoms, and I kept having odd things going on, so my onc has done some Pet Scans that have shown some lung nodules. I had my last Pet on July 12th that showed more lung nodules bilaterally and they old ones had grown. It also showed a lesion on my liver as well. I just had a biopsy on my right lung last Friday and will get results this Friday. But it looks as though my cancer has decided to come back with a vengence! Will now need to decide what treatment options are available. My hair which was once very long, dark, and curly.... well it has come back and it's different but at least it's growing. My brows are pretty much nonexistent, so I had to practice drawing them in alot. It's kinda hard to do it just right so I don't look angry or surprised! Haha!! It's so nice to read of everyones stories and what you are all doing now. Congratulations to all of you for everything that you are accomplishing!!! I'm just excited when I have good days and can take my grandson to the zoo and keep up with that bundle of energy!!",

I know , for me, there have been times where I really don't feel like the same person I was before all this happened. I think differently, act differently, and my priorities have changed. All this while still fighting for things to be the way they were and for life to get back to normal. So I understand why my husband sometimes gives me that \"look\" like he has never seen me before or that I have grown two heads. I am not the same! I never will be the same. that's ok because life is a progression and we all experience personal growth. We're suppose to. All part of that nasty growing up gig! It's hard on us and also on the folks who love us. Not everyone is going to behave the way we want and sometimes it's just hard for them to accept everything that is changing so quickly. Just sitting down, holding hands and having some good old fashion talking can work wonders.",

Right before starting chemo, I had my hair cut page boy length and donated the rest to Locks of Love. After 2 treatments and the hair coming out in hand fulls, I had my hubsters buzz it down to about an eight of an inch. The stubble was really uncomfortable to sleep on so getting a very slippery satin or silk pillow case was a godsend!! I also got tired of finding the little hairs everywhere so I used a sticky lint roller a few times a day to collect all the loose hairs. Finally there came a day when I had no stubble left! whaa!!  Now that I am sprouting again, I am back to using the slippery satin pillow case and it feels soooo good against my head!!",

So I understand how scared and shocked you must be. It's ok to cry if you need to. Waiting til Monday is going to put your emotions through a blender. I know hearing the information from the radiologist probably felt like a truck hitting you. It's hard to digest so much when there is so much uncertainty along with fear. I'll be sending calming thoughts your way. Please know that you can ask any question here and find lots of support and information. This site has been very encouraging for me.",

It's hard to lose a loved one and it helps to remember good times and to cherish all those memories. I am triple negative and also have the BRCA1 gene. I am at stage 3C. I have had others in my family with BC who did not carry the gene and who were not triple negative. I know it doesn't seem to make any sense some times. Cancer is it's own monster with it's own agendas. Please take care of yourself and allow yourself to grieve and to lean on your friends and family for comfort and support. There is also alot of good information on these boards that may be helpful. Again, I offer you condolences.",

You may find it by doing an internet search using the BCCP cancer program and the name of the state you live in. They use low income guidelines and are pretty lenient in that respect. They will pay for your screening and all of your treatments if you qualify and have cancer. I am currently using their services now in Indiana. I know that one of theri other criteria is that you cannot be covered under any other insurance programs. After they approve you, you will be issued a state standard care medicaid card. Not only will it cover your breast issues but it will also pay for any other medical issues that you may have. Once your cancer treatment is completed then they will terminate your coverage. This program has been a godsend for me and my family after being diagnosed. We made too much money for a regular medicaid card and I was so frightened about how I was going to pay for treatment. I sincerely pray that your tests all come back healthy and wonderful but it's comforting to know that there are services out there that offer help.",
