I have felt a lump in breast for 6 weeks. The mammogram was followed up with going directly to get an ultrasound which then in turn showed abnormalities and I have a Ultrasound Guided Biopsy scheduled this coming Tuesday the 26th. The waiting is awful! My mind is racing, I am trying to keep busy and at times I can get my mind off of this and at times it is all I am thinking about. I am not sure if it is psycho semantic or what but I am feeling occasional pain in my left breast and a warm sensation, not continuous, but comes and goes. To make matters worse they showed me my mammogram results from 2013 (different hospital) and showed me there was something on that one and that it has grown. Thank you for letting me share. Best wishes to you.",
