I do feel that the DO's dismiss the side effects especially the fatigue since it is not visible. (DOC in condescending voice \"You have my permission to take a nap in the afternoon \"... ME: \"F*ck off\" ...jk) I was considerably active before the Diagnosis and have tried hard to continue, however I am noticing pain throughout body after exercise that I have never felt before. My energy is only in the AM and by PM I am fatigued - but not sleepy - just more like a zombie or sloth. I feel depressed about the situation. People have said this happened to show me how I need to take care of myself. As much as I partially agree, if I don't like the person saying this I m then think \"F* Off\". I am grateful to my Primary Care physician (female) that recognized my need to take short term disability from a super high stress job or I would not have made it through the treatments. Now I will see how long the side effects last. Also, my Doc suggested CBD oil (marijuana minus the THC) for pain and sleep if available in y9ur state, I will try soon.",

This occurred after about one week of radiation on my right breast. I had an endometrial ablation 9 years ago and now too old to be menstruating..? I asked my Primary Care MD and she said to follow up with RO but most likely will need to have an ultrasound. Asked RO and he said it is not related to the radiation. I have an appointment with GYN in August. I joined this site to reply to Patti's post since I was so surprised this happened to someone else!!",
