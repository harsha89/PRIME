In the last 3 years I have had between 6-8 biopsies each year plus ultrasounds and mammograms every year. I couldn't possibly wait 6 months. In fact I collapsed with the stress at the last round and ended up in hospital after a panic attack. I'm know I can't keep doing this. You sound so much stronger than me. Evi",
