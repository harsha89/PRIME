My GP alredy said she was 100% certain I had breast cancer on new years eve and the waiting for the tests is hard, but the thought of having them is even worse. My lump is 12cm, and next week I'm having other scans on bones and vital organs, though the breast surgeon said that he can't feel it spreading to my lymph under my arm and I don't have other symptoms for the cancer spreading. So what is a core biopsy actually like on a large lump?  Log in to post a reply",

I've been crying non stop for hours, like Iv'e known I've got cancer for 6 months, yet today, even though I definately want to be here for my daughters teenage years I feel like I may as well end it now. I've been the strongest I've ever been these last two weeks, and people like family and school mums and my grumpy husband have got me down big time tonight. I've been crying in the road, and in the garden . I dont think I will take an overdose but I'm so temted. I'm so so so sad just now. I'm going to put my socks on and drink a lot of water.  Log in to post a reply",

I've had 5 tac chemotherapys to shrink the stage 3 lump and it has shrunk from 12 cm down to 5cm. They will do a masectomy with lymph glands removed very soon. I can't shake the cutting my boob off with a pair of sheers, or maybe a guillotteen, and then sealing it with a red hot poker imagery from my mind. I know its more sophisticated than that, otherwhise it wouldn't take 3 hours. The end result seems the same. No boob at all and big scars. I'm a 34d cup size and so when I squash the effected boob down the one that's left will be enormous, next to nothing. I don't think I will go for breast reconstruction, I need to decide that next year this time when it's all healed over and I can't imagine inviting surgeons to take muscles away from the rest of me for cosmetic reasons. I have to say goodbye to cleavage and half my wardrobe.My long blonde hair and my boobs were the most attractive parts of me and they are gone. I will have to have 5 years of hormone therapy that will stop my ovaries producing eostogen and progesterone and I will probably start the menopause early. My mum has HRT post menopause to stop depression, and I will never have that option as I need the opposite hormonal effect.  Help, they are going to hack my boob off and there is nothing I can do about it.

      "Content": "jacquibutterfly wrote: Well I have now had 5 tac chemotherapies and am due my my masectomy with lymph glands very soon. Subject 1- smoking. I have been smoking cigarretes for about 25 years, ever since I was 16 with the sress and cultureal pressure of going to pubs and exams. I suppose I've smoked about 10 cigarretes a day ever since. When I was first diagnoseed I smoked ciggees like there was no tomorrow, and drank large vodka and oranges, and some beer.I find that I still smoke cigees even though they they don't taste too good ( neither does water, tea, any other drink, most foods if I think about them ). I am addicted,  and my cutting down means stopping them half way through and having the other half later. When I had surgery to have my port fitted I used a nicorrettte inhaler in the hospital, and I'll bring one in for the masectomy as there is no longer a smoking area at the hospital.  subject 2 - Drinking  Oh dear, this one I can control much better, I just can't stomach alcohol at the moment, which is a shame as the culture I live in revolves around it socialy.It's what I usually did when I met friends and family, have a couple of beers or glasses of wine and jovially chat the night away.In week 3 of chemotherapy, as I'm starting to recover and have stopped the anti-biotics, I do have a couple of drinks with friends if they pop round which makes me feel more normal. The dehydration at night after one too many is almost unbearble though, I get white spittal around the edge of my mouth and am even more lethargic the next day.I feel at least I had  a bit more than a half life for a moment in time. I suppose my question is, does anyone else smoke and/or drink when undergoing chemotherapy?How does it effect you? Cheers my dears ,good vibes , Jacqui.Xx.  Log in to post a reply",
