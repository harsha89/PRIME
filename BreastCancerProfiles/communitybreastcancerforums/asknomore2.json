All my labs were good except for my white blood count was 25.2 which meant I definitely had an infection.

But my new model is not to complain. While hospitalized on the oncology floor I met and seen patients who had been through a whole lot of procedures and chemotherapy treatments. So hopefully I all will work out as it should.",

My Oncologist took one look at the wounds and sent me back to the plastic surgeon on Friday.He decided to bring me in on Monday to clean the wounds and stitched them closed. The funny thing about my wounds, they were on the unaffected breast.. I will receive my 1st dose of Taxol and Herceptin. I was told to bring frozen Elasto- gel mittens and Natura socks hopefully to prevent neuropathy. I couldn\u2019t think about a cooling cap.I\u2019m hoping to make it to my grandson football game on Friday evening but that may be wishful thinking after Taxol and Herceptin.",
