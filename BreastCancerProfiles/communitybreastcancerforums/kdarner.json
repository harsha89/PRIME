My surgeon will also be putting a port in place. I will begin chemo about 4 weeks later. Not sure the exact cocktail yet, but I will be getting herceptin and perjeta due to the HER2 3+ positive status. I've always considered myself to be a low maintenance model, meaning not a lot of makeup, I don't fuss with my hair and nails too much, but I am having a hard time with the thought of hair loss and appearance. I am not a hat person and don't know how to rock a scarf. I did recently order a wig, hoping that will not be too uncomfortable. I hope to be able to continue working while I am doing the chemo phase. Any suggestions on how to overcome these issues.",
