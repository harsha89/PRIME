Since then she has been on hormonal treatment. First Arimidex (few months) then Faslodex (For almost 2 years now). She also gets Zometa for bone mets. Up until this autumn she did fine. Almost as nothing had ever been wrong (I sure am aware that with this dgn. you cannot have such luck forever) In oct/nov she started to complain joint pain in right ankle. Then her knees started to feel painful while climbing stairs. Then there was pain in her thumb and one of her wrists. She has constantly reminded it to her onc as well but he does not seem to make much out of it think it is anything remarkable. Two months ago she started to see pain doctor on her own initiative. She has been on opioids since then, rather strong ones I suppose. She uses all kinds on ointmets etc, puts on cold compress but absolutely nothing seems to work. The situations gets worse actually. Today she is almost unable to walk because knees hurt so bad. As she describes it: bone to bone feeling. Hard to get up in the morning and hard to get up when sitting. Ankle is a bit swollen as well and hot. Finally, as she is almost crippled, bone scan was ordered for her. It is next week. Last CT was in november and it was stable. She is tired from the opioids, lost her appetite as well. Unable to go out, because she is in so much pain when walking. I am just wondering, what on earth is going on? Has anyone of you ever experienced anything like this. I mean, you eat tons of narcotic painkillers and get no relief what so ever...is it mets? arthritis? Something else? I understand it is hard to distinguish bone mets from arthritis...But if any of you have had something similar, could you please share your experience with us? Can I ever go for walks with her again? Thank you in advance...

She felt actually okay the first days with some tummy ache, but today she is feeling awful pain from her hip down the leg. She has been mostly bedridden today.Her bone mets are widespread and she has had some pain in sacrum, hip, knees before.Could it be a flare reaction?
