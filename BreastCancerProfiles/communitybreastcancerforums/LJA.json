      "Content": "LJA wrote: Hi - I had my second annual mammogram last Friday and received a call on Tuesday that the radiologist wanted additional views and an ultrasound on right breast due to \"asymmetric parenchymal tissue more rounded in appearance in two locations with a smaller third structure\" (2 oval shaped structures 11 mm and 12 mm in size and a third round structure 5 mm in size). All three areas are more prominent than last exam (however last exam did not say anything about these areas). It seems like all three were only visible on one view but that part of the report is a bit confusing (like two were visible in one view and the third was visible in the other view). When I was around 25 years old (am 45 now) I had a lump in left breast that was not visible on ultrasound so had mammogram follow-up immediately after and then 6 months later that was determined to be fine at that time. I am very nervous as I had a benign pleomorphic adenoma removed from my parotid gland last November. I had just about every test they could order prior to the surgery with all of the tests being non-specific and am having a ton of anxiety now about the call back on the mammogram and any additional tests that may be ordered. I was probably one of the most high maintenance patients the imaging center has had in a while - I called at least three times with questions regarding the procedures tomorrow. Probably doesn't help that I was a nurse in my previous career. I just wanted to vent a bit to others who have been in similar situations. Thanks for taking the time to read :-)   Log in to post a reply",

I actually love to workout and follow a pretty intense program but anxiety has gotten the best of me tonight. Most likely going to grab the cats and a book and try to read for a bit. I am trying to remember the positive odds and percentages :-) I just had a very unusual tumor removed so hoping the chances of hitting another small percent of the population are even smaller!  ",
