Just the initial faxed page 1 with the graph and the score , yeap 42  (29% chance of reoccurence) here is what the path report says: \"HER-2/neu: chr 17 signal ratio= 1.8 HER-2/neu gene amplification NOT observed. \"                  (FISH test) Does that agree with your thoughts??? I didn't start reading on this site until a couple days ago. But, it certainly doesn't really mesh with the others- Julie",

The idea of something put in my body- I somethings think that I am a cadaver and a lab rat- UGHHH!! Today is my first chemo and I am again petrified!! I thing that the anxiety is worse than the actual diagnosis!  Keep in mind guys- that cancer research is changing CONSTANTLY and progressing faster than any other research avenues- It certainly has a majority of funding. Maybe in that 1.7 more years there will be a cure- I am not fool enough to think that in 5 years all will be perfect in this imperfect world. But, with all of us being part of these statistics- certainly there will be another form of treatment someday. I too will be \"put\" into menopause- I am 42 as well- and have regular periods- but, I have two wonderful children and the LAST thing that I want is another baby. It will be sad that that \"chapter\" will officially be over- but, seems to be no other choice (for me). I HATE all these drugs!! HATE it. I had both of my children AT HOME- (NO drugs) don't vaccinate and am not even sure if we had tylenol in the house before all of this began. Now I seem to have a pharmacy of meds!! Ativan being the most helpful!! HAHHAHAHA I hope that you all have a blessed day- and that you think of me at some oint tethered to a machine that I know is going to make me sick in a few days. UGHHHH!! Love to you all Jules",

I could not do the Mammosite- as I am 42 years old and wasn't \"randomized\" into the study for partial breast radiation. I will be doing that after the 16 weeks of chemo (8 treatments) I am NOT exactly sure of the drugs yet- I have to go to \"Chemo class\" before all of this starts.Adriamycin for sure for 4 times then toxal or another - I still get my periods every 26 days- exactly!hahahh It seems that pre-meno, and 42 are issues with some things. TUMOR 1.5 CM,   Stage 1   Grade 2  ER+ 90%    PR+ 20+    HER2/neu -    Oncoscore 42 I have two small children 7 and 9 so if 16 weeks of chemo it is- that is what it is. They will put the port in (below collar bone) and do 1st treatment on the same day- I don't kow what I am more afraid of- I opted for initial excsional biobsy. I then did another lumpectomy to WIPE out the margins- and that she did!!! 8cm X 8 CM 3 CM- Sent. Node disection 0/2~~ we were waiting for the ONCO test to see if I would be randomized into partial radiation study- If you want you can read at www.caringbridge.org    type julieharvey Love to all of you AMAZING women!!!
