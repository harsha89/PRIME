Everybody in my life has been incredibly supportive. This experience has been an emotional roller coaster. The hardest part has been seeing how if effects my husband and father. I\u2019ve seen my dad cry because of it and that is painful for me. I reassure them that I am fine. On to the point of my post. I have not worked since surgery April 17th. I am an occupational therapist in a nursing home. My job is bothering physically Andy mentally demanding. I am currently receiving 16 radiation treatments. I just received the 8th. I would like to return to work but have hesitated since people say the fatigue and skin issues get worse at the end. I am currently receiving short term disability which would stop if I return to work. I\u2019m afraid if I return to work and start to feel unwell I may have to take more time off. So far side effects have been minimal. Could someone who had similar work demands give me advice? My work is very supportive. Log in to post a reply",

My radiation oncologist is concerned that my ability to be there 100% for my patients may be compromised. Your statement about staying at home if you could have is especially helpful. I only have 7 treatments left. I just always feel guilty when I am out of work. I am beginning to be more cranky which could be fatigue or just a response to bad weather",

I have been walking a lot and doing as much house and yard work as possible. Since I am almost at the end of the active treatment I just may stay home.",

Routine is important to me so once I am out of one I start to doubt myself. It\u2019s been hard because I have felt almost normal physically throughout everything. I am starting to feel a bit more fatigued and who knows how I would feel if I was working. Thanks again this forum is very helpful.  ",
