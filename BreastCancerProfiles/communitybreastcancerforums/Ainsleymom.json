When I went to breast surgeon, he was very comfortable with not doing the biopsy because this spot had shown up on a previous mammogram and there were no changes and in his opinion, it didn't appear suspicious. I went with his advice to follow up in six months with a mamm and the results were fine. Fast forward to now, I small amounts of blood coming from the nipple of the same breast. I am scheduled for a routine (but late) mamm on Monday but, of course, that seems like a long time away. My question is, should I call the dr. and let her know what's going on so they can switch to a diagnostic mamm instead of screening, or should I just go ahead with the appt and let the tech know that I have a new symptom? In my head. I know it's a no brainer and very easy to call the dr office, but I guess I'm just looking to tell someone about this so I can get it off my chest. I don't want to say anything to anyone else because I don't want to seem like I'm looking for trouble when there is none. Is blood from a nipple ever not ominous? Thank you for listening!
