The ultrasound confirms the presence of a 9 X 6mm irregular hypoechoic mass lesion in the superior aspect of the right breast at around 12-1 o'clock position. it shows an irregular contour, taller than wide, with extensive posterior acoustic shadowing, and abnormal vascularity on colour doppler flow.

I would like to think of myself as a problem solver rather than one who panics when there is the possiblity of disaster. My wife is a great lady and she has suffered tremondously over the past 27 years of our marriage with severe asthma, excema and alergies. She is currently 52 years of age and we have three children 24, 20 and 27. Not more than a year ago she was also diagnosed with Lyme's disease. She is the last of 10 children in her family and has been chronic in these health areas since she was born. Regardless of the historical perspective, the situation is now one that can be more potentially devastating for her because of her already broken down immune system. I am certainly going into this situation with both eyes wide open and will challenge it the best that we can within our powers. From the information that I have gathered so far, a \"spicular Tumor\" is not a tumor that one would wish upon. The size, being 9 X 6mm is definitely working in her favour. The fact that it is classified as a Barids 5 is also not good but then, a biopsy or full removal would have to take place to actually determine a clear diagnosis. Although it seems that a Barids 5 classification is not good, there is still a 20% chance that the entire growth can also be benign. With respect to its vascularity, it seems that it has a better chance of getting inro the blood system with the spiked formation of the tumor. Nonetheless, next Tuesday we are going to the breast cancer clinic in Toronto and shortly after the surgury will take place---thank God for \"Universal Health Care\", she will be cared for in a very effiecent and profesional manner. I would appreciate your thoughts on my comments. Give it to me straight because it becomes much easier to to reflect and deal with the problems as they unfold. Thanks johnnyd .",
