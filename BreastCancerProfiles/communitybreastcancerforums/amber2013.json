      "Content": "amber2013 wrote: In October I started feeling a tremendous pain in my left breast right below the nipple. It hurt very badly for a few weeks. Nothing helped, rest, advil, heating pads, aspirin. It subsided but a few weeks later I had severe back pains under my left shoulder blade. Again nothing helped. As weeks progressed the back pain went away but I developed a heavy pain in the breast again along with a strange deep itchiness. A few days ago I did an examination and found a strange lump ( bumpy and tender) where the initial pain was. Â I have also been feeling like the lump wants to expel itself... if that makes sense? I am so scared. I am in panic mode. I will schedule a mamogram tomorrow but just want to know what you'll think of this? Now the lumpy area feels heavy and slightly throbs. I have a fear of doctors so this is really rough for me. Log in to post a reply",
