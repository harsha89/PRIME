This morning I could barely move my arms and I wanted so badly to take a muscle relaxer, but instead I took a hot, 30 minute shower and tried to move around a lot. I took my toddler out in the rain this evening and let him splash in puddles, then gave him a shower. It's the first time I've given him a shower since surgery. My hubby has been doing it. I sat on the tub with my feet in the tub and did it, but I did it! It actually didn't hurt, so I'm celebrating that tiny victory. Today I kept reaching above my shoulders and the muscle spasms sternly reminded me that that was a no no. Each day things are getting a little more normal. It's a new normal, and I long for the day I can get these bricks out of my chest, but I know I'm closer everyday. I'm also really tired of going to appointments, as I'm sure many of you are. Monday I had a dentist appt, Tuesday was my fill, Wednesday I took my son to the doctor, and today I saw a dermatologist. I am thankful that I don't have appointments for radiation or chemo, so I really shouldn't complain. I am also thankful that I am able to drive and make it to these appointments without having to be chauffeured. I hope you are all starting to get back to your new normal and your pain is diminishing each day. Thanks for letting me babble about nothing. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

While recovering from my BMX, I spent so much time keeping up with everyone, then I went back to work and life got in the way and I haven't been back. On Friday, I had my exchange surgery. It was just as I'd heard, so much easier than the BMX. What a relief to have the cement blocks out of my chest! The pain has almost completely been from the fat grafting, and each day it has gotten a little better. I'm battling headaches, nausea and some dizziness and I wonder if it may be the Keflex my PS gave me. I am wearing a compression wrap on my stomach and a surgical bra, without the ten pounds of gauze they stuffed me with. While I know that it is early on and I have been smashed in this surgical bra since surgery, I can barely stand to look at my chest. Honestly, I hate it. My PS went with 600cc gel implants, but they just look like big, wide, flat mounds. I know it's partially because I was used to those erect, protruding cinderblocks that were spaced too far apart, and very unnatural looking, but even with a larger sized implant than I had expected, my chest looks terrible. I've heard that they go through some type of \"fluff\" or something, and I know I shouldn't complain because, as I've been told, \"I'm alive\", but please someone tell me that it gets better than this. I wasn't planning to look like a supermodel or anything, but somehow I thought they would look more like breasts. Were my expectations unreasonable? Has anyone else been disappointed? I'm not disappointed with the size necessary, but the look. Maybe it's just too soon? Maybe I just need to stop whining and get over myself",

Today my niece gave me some samples of Bio oil, so after my shower tomorrow, I'll lube the girls up and pray that my skin heals better. My incisions look great and are healing nicely, but the skin around them is horrible. I have phantom and shooting pains a lot too, but they don't last long enough to take meds. When I drink something cold or get a chill, it feels like my nipples get hard and I don't even have nipples! Does anyone else have lots of skin sensitivities or phantom pains, or am I just a weirdo? About a week after surgery, I was sitting on the porch and it felt like my milk let down! I think someone needs to tell my brain that MY BOOBS ARE GONE! Still having some pain from my fill on Tuesday, but hoping it will keep easing. I almost forgot, today I drove for the first time! It felt SO good to be able to take myself somewhere, instead of depending on someone else to chauffeur me. My PS has had me so restricted that it was more difficult than I thought it would be. I can't wait to begin PT. I'm babbling again. Sorry. Just feels good to share with ladies who understand how this all feels. Take care and God bless!",

Once I left it off for about two hours and had horrible pain until I put it back on. I told him about it and he told me to put it back on as soon as I got out of the shower. I haven't struggled with a lot of pressure pain, and I'm convinced that may be why. Also, until today, the pressure of the fills hasn't been uncomfortable. I assume all of that will change as I get closer to the end of my fills. My skin hates me for wearing bras all the time and my skin is very sensitive and flaking off, but I'll just keep slathering on a moisturizer and tough it out for a few more weeks. Maybe try a bra for a few days and see if that helps? I wouldn't have dreamed of sleeping in a bra, but Ive come this far, so I'll keep toughing it out. Guess I will see after the next few fills how my body deals with the pressure. Hope you get relief soon",

It was a different kind of nauseous, and one that I can't really explain. I was also feeling depressed some, or just numb headed, if that makes sense. I've never had to take medicine on a daily basis, except for an inhaler that treats my asthma, so I wonder if maybe I've just dreaded it so much that I'm making myself sick. I didn't eat enough yesterday all day, so I could maybe contribute the way I felt to that. I don't know why I'm having such a difficult time with taking it. We went to a pool party this evening, and on the way back home, I started feeling nauseous again. I remembered that I had planned to take my Tamoxifen at night to see if it would help with the nausea. It was so late when I got home, and my stomach is still upset, so I can't make myself take it. Why am I making such a big deal out of taking this stupid pill? I'm so thankful I didn't have to do chemo. I can't imagine how I would have handled that.

It's easy for me to say, but I hope you find another PS. I think it is so easy for them to dismiss our pain because there is NO WAY on earth anyone can imagine what we are feeling unless they've been through it. I researched and read everything I could before surgery, but NOTHING prepared me for all of this. I can't begin to imagine your frustration. I do understand the frustration of missing work after being off all summer. I ran out of days for the first surgery and I'm thankful to have summer break to recover, but my exchange won't happen before we go back in August either, so I'll have to take time off again. I wish I could plan it around a long weekend or something, but I have no intention of keeping these stupid expanders in any longer than necessary. I definitely don't want to wait until Thanksgiving. They say the recovery for the exchange is much easier. I pray it's quicker too. I hope things turn around for you soon. FaithsMama: I'm sorry you are so miserable. I can't imagine dealing with so much pain, AND what you're going through with your friend. I've been with my husband for 30 years, so I've forgotten how to date. I'm also probably much older than you, and I can't even imagine being back into the dating scene. However, I do know about depression and how easily it can take over your life. My faith keeps the depression at bay. Otherwise, I would be a total psycho right now. Thanks for telling me about the grand side effect of Tamoxifen. Sexual dysfunction? Just shoot me now. Ironically enough, I've been thinking about sex a lot lately. (Did I just type that?üò≥) I'm afraid to do anything, and today I was feeling sorry for my husband, because my breasts are dead. How much pleasure could he get from caressing these rocks? He says it doesn't matter, but it bothers me. I won't dwell on it, but today it had me thinking. Sorry for the TMI. There's probably another group for that talk. üòâ As far as getting back into a routine, I'm slowly able to do more and the pain of Tuesday's fill is gone, but I go back this Tuesday, so that relief will be short lived I guess. I am taking baby steps. I took my 4 year old for a walk today and played more than I have been able to in weeks. Not being able to clean my house is killing me. How I long to be able to sweep and mop my floors, run the vacuum cleaner, and be able to reach my microwave without wearing wedges. My son's room is a nightmare. I can't even go in there. üò± Yesterday I paced the floor agonizing over it all. Fortunately, I don't have to go back to work until August, so my routine this time of year is much more relaxed anyway. kandyhunt: I will be 6 weeks post op on Tuesday, and I am still in the recliner. I tried to nap in the bed with mounds of pillows, and it lasted less than 10 minutes. I am a fetal position/side sleeper, so the recliner sucks big time. However, I couldn't get comfortable in bed at all. I laid there and obsessed about how badly I wanted to lay on my side, so I got mad and gave up. I've had permanent stiff neck because of the recliner, but it is beginning to get a little better. How I wish I could go to a chiropractor and get my body realigned. My body hates me right now. As for the bras, I've spent more on bras since I had surgery than I have in 5 years. Can't wear most of them now, because of the fills. I bought a DD sports bra from Target last week because I'm sick of having to buy new ones. I have room to grow, and when I wear it, the girls look amazing! ü§£ I don't even look like I've had a mastectomy when I wear it. I keep thinking about the silver lining and not having to wear bras anymore after I get the implants. That's when I'll REALLY be excited about not having nipples! My daughter is excited that she will inherit all of these great bras I've had to buy. ljm33: I am still restricted and haven't started PT. I'm anxious to begin because I hate how little my range of motion is. I'm not even supposed to put my arms straight out to the side. I just did it to see how well I could and it is discouraging. I am going to ask about it again on Tuesday. Maybe he will get tired of me asking and finally release me to do PT. He assures me that it will all come back and that the most important thing right now is keeping these cinderblocks in place. I'll just keep apologizing for the lengthy babble, because more than likely, all of my replies will be much too long. Instead of sleeping like I should be right now, I would rather catch up and hear how all of you are doing. Sending you virtual hugs and praying that each day will be better for you than the day before. üôèüèº",

I swear I'm not going to read anything about it, except what I see here. I'm encouraged just to read that it isn't as bad as I thought it might be. Tomorrow is my weekly fill and I am trying not to be anxious. It wasn't bad last week as far as the needle, but the pain and pressure was pretty intense for a few days. I feel like things are getting back to normal for me. I find myself forgetting about these bricks in my chest a lot, so I think I am also probably doing things my PS wouldn't approve of. I consider it progress when I don't constantly think about the discomfort. Yesterday I took the bra off and wore a tank top for a bit. I haven't been able to do that since I was a teenager. I also discovered how quickly the saline in my chest changes temperatures. Good grief! It is in the 90s here and yesterday I went to a cookout. A storm rolled in and we had horrible wind and I even got cold from the rain blowing in on me. Every part of my body was cool, but my foobs were HOT! It's freaky, and I'm glad I decided not to go with saline implants. I can't imagine how COLD they would get in the winter! I can't remember who mentioned the skin sensitivity, but I have it. I have places that feel like something is rubbing the skin raw, but it isn't even red. The skin under my expanders feels raw ALL the time. I keep slathering the Bio oil on, but I know it is the band on the bras I wear all the time. I'm so sick of wearing them. Looking forward to getting out with my toddler this week. Nothing gets you back in the swing of things like a needy toddler. I love him more than my luggage, but he sure makes me feel every single one of my 48 years. Since I was able to go out alone with him and buckle him in his car seat, I'm anxious to get back to our mommy/son adventures. My older son turns 17 next weekend. When did I get so old??!!

I've been nursing it with ibuprofen, but I woke up in middle of the night with pain and then again this morning. The hot shower helped some, as did the ibuprofen, but I let the meds wear off and I can barely move my arms. I really want to at least go 50 more, then do the final fill, but OMG! This week hurts more than last. I have to wear a bra, so I'm always second guessing the one I'm wearing and wondering if it is causing some of the pain too. What I would love to do is take a dose of heavier meds, but I have my 4 year old today, so I can't. The first several weeks of recovery were easier because he was going to the sitter everyday. She is on vacation this week, so I have him all day. This morning I pushed through the pain and took him to a movie. Now I'm done. Really done. I can't imagine 50 more, but I'm praying this eases up a lot in the next day or two. I purposely made my next week appointment on Thursday to give myself a little more time to recover. I too have the summer off, so I feel for those who have had to go back to work. I may have been able to go back before the last two fills, but I'm glad I didn't have to. I don't have anyone to come get my little one or spend the day with him. Since he was a midlife surprise, none of my friends my age have toddlers so we could arrange play dates, and most of them work full time. It's a struggle, but we do what we have to do. I don't have any advice on having younger children and going through this. I can only offer sympathy. My toddler and I do EVERYTHING together. Nothing slows us down. He is handling it pretty well, but I feel guilty all the time. I play and go as much as I can, but it sure isn't much. üò¢",

After reading your posts, I'm relieved to know it is common. I can't decide really where the pain is. Sometimes I think my expanders are digging into my ribcage and maybe that is what causes the pain. It doesn't help that my skin feels horrible underneath the expanders, but it isn't even red. The skin on my chest has certainly changed since surgery, as has the skin on my whole torso. I am seeing a dermatologist tomorrow to make sure that there isn't something going on that will interfere with my progress. My PS has been concerned about it for a few weeks, but I also don't moisturize when I see him, so it is extra red and dry. I haven't been good to my skin over the years. Lots of sunburns have left me with loads of freckles and I am already beginning to have my grandma's \"age spots\". BC has me terribly paranoid about other cancers, so I want to make sure I don't have any type of skin cancer. I will also be using a lot of sunblock from now on. I like to tan, but I'm all done with letting myself fry. My main goal now (besides getting my life back) is to lose weight and try to get into shape. However, I love to eat and I haven't been released to do much of anything. No PT yet and still no lifting over 5lbs. I've been secretly envious of those who are already working out. A friend and I are going to start walking. Maybe I can walk enough to help lose some of the extra pounds. I feel like I'll be much happier with a smaller chest if my gut wasn't so big. I just can't seem to be motivated to do anything about it yet. It doesn't help that I have a house full of picky eaters, none of them heathy habits. Right now I'm just trying to recover from the fill yesterday. It sounds like the walking might even help that. I've also figured out that when I overdo it, I suffer more in the mornings. If you think you could be overdoing it, you probably are. Hang in there ladies! Thanks again for sharing your experiences!",

I took it at night, prepared to get up and take nausea meds if necessary, but I didn't wake up sick. I won't go to the Tamoxifen forum. I have found these communities to be most helpful to prepare me, as well as encourage me through this, but I don't want to read about negative experiences with it. I think that would only add to my anxieties about taking it. I have been walking three miles each morning and trying to watch what I eat, so I pray that weight gain won't be a side effect that my body decides to take on. I'm blown away at so many who aren't wearing bras. My PS insists I wear support 24/7. I have been able to lose the dinosaur arms and besides having my arms above my head, I am getting a better range of motion. I do the wall walking exercise when I remember, and I'm driving a lot now, but still find it very difficult to twist my torso comfortably to look over my shoulders. Does anyone else have trouble with that? I've enjoyed having the week off from fills. I'm up to 460ccs and I'm getting more comfortable with my size, although I hope to have at least one more fill. My fear is that I'll get that \"one last fill\" that will keep me in pain until my exchange. I don't want to be miserable until then. We are going to the beach at the end of the month, and I don't want to ruin everyone's vacation by being in pain or more dependent on them than I already am. My oncologist told me that I should never carry a heavy shoulder bag or extremely heavy objects with my left arm, which was the only one with lymph nodes removed. I haven't had any swelling at all, (praise the Lord) so I wonder if it is because I haven't been lifting much. I have always been a pack horse. I can lift as much as my husband, and I'm one of those \"carry all the groceries inside in one trip\" kinda girls. It's weird how our doctors are all different. I can't imagine weight training or even lifting my toddler right now, much less an 80lb dog! I hurt when I carry a gallon of milk too long. I'm impressed at how some of you can do these things! Kudos to you and your superwoman abilities! I hope your days are getting better. I am getting used to my new normal, although there are little things that still drive me nuts. Like being afraid to hug people, because I know they are feeling these coconuts digging into their chest. I am a hugger, so I miss being able to do it without pain or fear of hurting someone. Also, I've found myself trying to adjust my seat in the car, and pressing my expanders so hard into the steering wheel before I realize that I'm doing it. I can't feel it, so I'm afraid I'll pop one of these jewels doing something stupid like that. I also still can't sleep in bed. I was able to nap in bed once, but it was before the last fill. Getting in and out of bed is quite painful, so I wimp out and just go back to the recliner. Anyway, I'm not complaining about the little things. I'm very thankful that I'm not dealing with other treatments or horrible pain. I hope those of you who are find relief very soon. Just feels good to express how I'm feeling to someone who can actually relate. Have a blessed weekend!",
