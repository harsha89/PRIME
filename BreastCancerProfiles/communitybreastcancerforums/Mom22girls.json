      "Content": "Mom22girls wrote: Hello all :) My first post. I have totally convinced myself I have IBC. Woke up one morning to a huge boobie that was red and hot. Went to PCP who just did a clinical exam in the previous week and found nothing - this time she felt a palpable mass. Its not round, doesn't hurt, and doesn't move. In fact when I try to move it - it sticks to the skin and brings it right along. I have some indenting at this spot as well. Was told to get a diagnostic mammogram. My last one unfortunately was 2 years ago (last year I had a spinal fusion and was one very high pain meds for about 6 months so it didn't even occur to me to get it. I am 44 and have BC on my maternal side. Im trying to be rational about this as I KNOW my body and this just feels wrong. I have been dense since I can remember - very. My ultrasound in 2013 rated me at 26-50% dense and it found \"a small oval density in left breast\". I had a compression mammo and ultrasound and things were fine. So, my ultrasound was scheduled for Monday of the next week. On Saturday I woke up and the red spot started turning purplish and got much larger. I read that IBC is an emergency so I went to the ED - who gave me antibiotics and told me to keep my mammo appt. Monday arrives (5/2/16) and I get to the radiologist who asks for my 2013 ultrasound and says she cannot give me the diagnostic mammo or ultrasound without it. I was very upset. I told her knowing that I have symptoms of IBC, if she didn't give me one it would be unethical. Well I got it done :) I was there quite a while during both exams. Preliminary report (since there was nothing to compare it to) says I am now 51-75% dense, RIGHT: have a focal symmetry in the area in question, targeted ultrasound is heterogeneous echotexture to the breast parenchyma at 9 o'clock with echo changes measuring 1.6 cm. There is a cluster of cysts at 9 o'clock 1 cm from nipple measuring 6x4x6mm. LEFT: focal asymmetry slight inner left mid-depth. Cyst at 1 o'clock 4cm from nipple measuring 3x2x5mm. BIRADS 0. The radiologist is awaiting comparative scans from 2013, and I was told to come back in 3 months - still pending results of 2013 for comparison (they are coming in mail so it will take 3 days) . PCP decided I should go see a breast specialist so I have one scheduled for next Thursday 5/12. Wondering what I have. Why my breast would go up in density when its supposed to go down during perimenopause. What the changes might indicate since last ultrasound and mammo. Why I have a red swollen breast that has not gone down since antibiotics. Why I have gigantic veins on my boobie that I have never seen before - these are HUGE. Dents on the side - but no orange peel. I just don't know. I have had cysts before and this just isn't the same. Its not like a lump but an \"area\" of solid. Oh and I feel \"let down\" many times during the day which I haven't felt for 12 years. Thank for letting me vent ladies - I appreciate it. Peace and love. Log in to post a reply",

She did an ultrasound but couldn't say what it was, just \"abnormality\", come back in 6 months for follow-up ultrasound. This is going on 3 weeks of not knowing what this is. All I know is that it's not suppose to be there.  I just found out Monday that my daughter needs open heart surgery at Boston Childrens within 6 months. I need to be on my best for her. Whatever this abnormality is, I cannot wait 6 months with a bunch of \"what if's\". I pitched a fit to my PCP and got myself an MRI, thank God!  One step closer to finding out exactly what this \"abnormality\" is",

I now have convinced myself I have some sort of BC but don't know what. My breast is now dimpled on the right exactly where the asymmetry is. AF came and went and left breast went down in size considerably and right breast is still \"engorged-like\". My left breast has always been larger because I breast fed two kiddos on the majority of that breast. I honestly have convinced myself, and if I'm not I'll be happy but absolutely in shock",

My dr. tried to order the mri but the insurance company denied it. My dr. got on the phone and did the peer to peer. The dr. from insurance company asked my dr if she felt the lump (which she origianally did not). My dr. replied 'no', and the insurance dr. said that would need to happen. I get a call and go to my dr. yet again that same afternoon. She finally can feel it and says that it is a cluster of 3. Okay, fine. She put sin the request. I don't hear anything for two days and call the insurance company myself. Apparently it was denied on 5/24 the same day it was submitted because the dr. or office staff put in a whole new request, rather than following up on the peer to peer so it is denied again. At this point I am fuming to say the least. My left breast is doing some funky things. It is considerably smaller. So what I had originally thought was the right breast getting bigger is actually the left breast shrinking. The nipple is sideways and my arm pit on the left side is swollen. My left is hard as a rock. So I'm thinking about what could be going on. I can't believe Im going to share this, but 2 weeks prior to feeling the lump on my right breast, I was waking myself in the middle of the night by tugging on my left nipple. No lie. About 10 days in arrow of waking myself up by pulling on it. Now I have never paid much attention to these things - they are always just there, so to me that was very strange. But as soon as my conscious self is paying all this attention to my breasts, the tugging and waking stopped - Im just wondering if my body knew and was trying to get me to be cognizant of it. So around two weeks ago as im examining them in the mirror knowing something is up but trying to find something to show the doctors so they will believe me, I start examining the nipples and seeing if there is any discharge of any kind. My left nipple felt much thicker at the base. I squeezed it and this is gross, but about 2 inches of something came out. I was a long line of like 'chesse\". It started coming out white, then changed to brown. My husband and I were so grossed out, never told anyone. Yesterday, when I noticed my nipple was sideways, I started to poke around some more. I found a lump in the left breast. Right underneath the nipple. This feels much different then the right breast. So I go back to my mammo reports. On my baseline, there was a density on my left breast viewed only on in one view. Three years later, 2016, it is now a focal assymetry, seen in both views. I am not a doctor but I am very intelligent. This tells me that it has more than one dimension. It is the size of two finger tips. I am begging both my dr and the breast surgeon to please look at my left breast - all attention was paid to my right and that lump - no one has ever looked at the left. I feel like nobody believes me and I don't want to waste any more time. I don't know what to do.",

Here's a question - This lump that I have is just obnoxious and I can see it sticking out - anyone can at this point. This is the second cycle its been here - no changes really, its just getting harder and there are two \"lines\" of hardness coming from the lump. Im waiting on the MRI date and should get a call at any moment. My question is can't they just remove this thing? Whatever it is - I shouldn't have to walk around with this \"abnormality\" in my boob regardless of what it is - never mind that as of yet no one can tell me what it is. What can appear seemingly out of no where and just be there? Im literally lost.",

Aunt died on May 21, and my grandmother died 2 days ago. I think this is literally the worst time in my life thus far. I know nothing compared to the fight you ladies fight daily and I mean no disrespect. I had an appointment with the first breast surgeon I went to and it was much different. She again felt the lump in question and said it was a bit larger. She tried to aspirate but couldn't penetrate it. On us it looked oval with a very dark halo around it with shadow lines on both sides.she then decided to take a core needle and pulled two samples. She put 8 pieces of tape and bandaged me up, I didn't feel a thing. My left breast was different. She didn't examine that breast previously. She said it felt much thicker/heavier than the right. She felt some \"hardened\" areas. She us'd it and couldn't make heads or tails of it, said I definatelyneeded an MRI. So in leaving, I was told to make a three month appointment. If something is found she will see me immediately again. I feel better that someone is taking me seriously and trying to get to the bottom of this. For the first time in 8 weeks I dont feel like a crazy person.",
