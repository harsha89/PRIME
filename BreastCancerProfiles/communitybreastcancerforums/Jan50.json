My onc said she would consider backing off to once every six months if I am still going strong at the five-year mark. But now I'm confused whether Zometa is supposed to cause bone and muscle pain or relieve it. I'll admit I've had more problems since backing off. However, I'm also told that the pain could be the result of tumor flare and an indicator that healing is taking place. So it's either getting better or getting worse, but they don't know which.
