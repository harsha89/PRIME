She said I have two different types of cancer, one is left breast mass 8 cm from nipple infiltrating ductal carcinoma Nottingham grade 1 of 3(5 of 9) nuclear score 2, tubule formation score 2 and mitotic rate 1, B) left breast mass 4 cm from nipple infiltrating ductal carcinoma with focal distinct high grade component,high nuclear grade and no tubule formation score 7 of 9 suggestive of meta plastic squamous and/or sarcoma you'd differentiation ER/PR/HER2-NEU evaluation pending I have really no idea what all this means and quite honest I went numb just listening so I did record it! She wants me to call tomorrow once I decide to either get lumpectomy or Masectomy, she said she really wouldn't know stage until after surgery and what treatment I would need. I don't know how bad this is but I don't think it's very good but I am trying to be strong and focused on getting this cancer out of me! Does anyone know what this all meAns? Thank you again!",

Alot has happened since I last posted so I will update you, good news first; my husband was discharged from hospital and is doing much better, he will probably be getting home dyalysis but we won't know until his lab report comes back tomorrow, he is on oxygen 24 hours a day but he is alive and he is getting stronger everyday thank God. I found a day training program for my daughter Terri who has cerebral palsy. That I feel comfortable with her going for awhile so that I can do this surgery and treatment! I also hired someone to do evening care with her for the days I won't be able to and my husband has a nurse that comes in so at least that part is done. My Doctor called to schedule double Masectomy on Feb 26 but she had to check to make sure reconstruction Doctor would be available on that date, turns out he doesn't accept Aetna HMO, so they said I should find another doctor to perform both the surgery and reconstruction which really had me worried because I felt comfortable with her, so after talking to my husband he agreed that I would call doctor back and just pay for the reconstruction out of pocket so I could stay with her but her assistant said the doctor would rather have me go thru Moffitt cancer center in Tampa which is almost 1 1/2 hours away so now I have to pick up my films from radiology and biopsy pathology report from doctor and go to a whole new Doctor who is male! I am just so frustrated, and then after finding more info on Metaplastic squamous, I am getting worried that maybe I shouldn't bother with reconstruction if my prodnosis is not good, the doctor was very clear stating that it has invaded the chest wall and surrounding tissue! I'm very worried! Maureen",

I finally had the core biopsy on two of the lesions yesterday and I go today to get results! I really haven't talked about it much because my husband has been in ICU for Renal Failure and I don't want to worry anyone if I don't have to so I went alone to biopsy yesterday and she wants me back in office today at 10:30am! I don't think it's good news because she wants me to have someone with me! Log in to post a reply",

My Doctor told me to stay off the Internet as far as looking up my diagnosis, she said there is alot of misinformation but she said this site is the best one to go to for info and for support and I'm so glad I did, I would normally talk to my husband or my kids but they have had so much to worry about with their Dad over the last week, I really don't want to put them thru any more than I have to! The Hospital took my husband off life support yesterday after they did Dyalysis and he was breathing on his own and he knew who I was so hopefully we have some good news finally! I am going to call my Doctor today and let them know I choose the Double Masectomy with reconstructive surgery and then we can go from there! Thank you again!",
