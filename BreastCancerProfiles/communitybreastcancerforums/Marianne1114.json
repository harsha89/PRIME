I was informed that I will need to take Decadron twice a day for 3 days after my chemo treatment (to prevent nausea). So, of course, I Googled the side effects of Decadron and I am not planning on taking the drug. I am meeting with my oncologist tomorrow and will ask if there is anything else I can take. I had 2 nausea prescriptions filled and they remain at the bottom of purse, untouched, throughout my 12 Taxol treatments. The side effects of Decadron that scared me -- swelling in the face (\"Moonface\"), increased appetite, e.g. eating every in the refrigerator, including the refrigerator, wild emotions (which I already have, can't imagine being any wilder). I came this far into my treatment without having a puffy face and without gaining any weight. I refuse to look any different this close to the end of my treatments. Maybe it is just vanity, but so be it. Basically, my question is this -- has anyone gone through 4 AC treatments without having nausea, or what drug(s) did you take to prevent nausea? The only thing I am noticing different about myself is that I now have heartburn, but absolutely no nausea. I drink water during my infusion, after my infusion, more water the following day, until it is coming out of my ears!!! I seem to think that this has helped me immensely. Thanks for any advice you can give me!! Log in to post a reply",
