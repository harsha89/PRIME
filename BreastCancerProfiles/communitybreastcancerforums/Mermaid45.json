I have had annual mammograms for ten years but this year due to a changeover of hospital I was sent for an MRI. Results were something in my upper left breast and I was sent for an ultrasound where nothing showed up. Back in six weeks for another MRI(that's on tues! Radiologist consultant ays it looked tween 2.5 and 5mm- tiny she called it. But said good that it was not showing up on ultrasound. As I am still pre menopause she said it could be hormonal changes. I went in all expecting a fine needle biopsy and told to go home for six weeks so it's been difficult. Anybody with similar experience out there with or without my lymphoma history would be so helpful right no Log in to post a reply",
