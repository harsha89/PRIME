Having extremely dense breasts does make me higher risk, so I may push for MRI. I thought I read somewhere on these boards that combining tomosynthesis with full breast ultrasound had an accuracy of something like 97% but I can't find the thread. I also can't remember if that was for extremely dense breast or not. ",

I got the report and I am wondering if anyone knows what a \"fusiform\" cyst means? It was done by one a top radiologist in my city, so I do trust that what they see is a complicated cyst, but I am wondering about the shape as I thought that cyst had to be round or oval, but what the heck is fusiform?? I read on google it's shaped like a fish...? Anyone heard of this? Here's what the report reads: \"The previously documented fusiform shaped hypo echoic mass with posterior acoustic enhancement is essentially unchanged measuring 4mm in greatest diameter. This is a complicated cyst. The cyst is stable. Recommend 6 month follow up. Birads 3.\" Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "andia wrote: Hi, This is my first post, but I have been reading for many months now. I am 46 and feel like my breasts are changing becoming more fibrocystic as I believe I am entering perimenopause (periods are changing). I had a 3D mammogram followed by u/s almost 6 months ago as I have \"extremely dense breasts\" and also lots of cysts. There were cysts found as well as one complicated cyst on the left, which is only 3.7mm that gave me a birads 3 follow up with u/s in 6 months. This has caused me anxiety, but was told it was too small to biopsy. I am due to have the u/s in a few weeks, but it's been a tough 6 months on my anxiety. I also have been feeling a weird pain on the other breast. I feel pain high up on the breast just under the collar bone. It feels tender, and skin feels sensitive to touch. I don't feel any hard lumps, but if i push hard, i think i feel a possible lymph node? Its hard to say, but seems to feel sore aching and i'm trying not to palpatate it too much as i think its making it hurt more. I plan on asking them to check it at my u/s as i think its too high up to get mammogram on that area. Has anyone any insight on what could cause pain high up? I am very anxious, thanks for any advice. Log in to post a reply",
