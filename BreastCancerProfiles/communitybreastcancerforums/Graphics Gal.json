I was allergic to the steri strips used and lost a big hunk of skin & tissue. After 3½ months of healing, I then developed an infection on that side....great!! That was when I decided enough was enough and opted to have expanders removed. That was a month ago. Now today I am going to get fitted for bra & prosthesis and thought... let's be smart about this and get some input on what to ask, what to look for etc. Thanks for your responses.  Pam Dx 7/25/2008, DCIS, 5cm, Stage 0, Grade 3, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",
