I discovered that it helps to turn my cami inside out. I have to wear a full length cami as I work and can't go without a bra.  Wearing it inside out puts the elastic on the outside and makes it much  more comfortable.  Right now a bra is just out of the question. I did find that using cocoa butter is helping relieve the itch and dryness much better than the Aquaphor.  I hate that greasy heavy feel so have been experimenting with other creams.  The cocoa butter is just what is working for me right now. I don't think I used the creams enough during my first treatments as I was not seeing any differences in my skin.  Let this be a caution to those of you who are just starting radiation.  Use those creams even if you are not seeing a change. And....I was never told to use cream in the armpit area and that area is by far the worst as far as burns and peeling.  so don't forget the armpit ladies.   You will be glad later. Anyway, the peeling seems to be getting a little better.  Hoping I am on the downhill slide and starting to heal. Have a good day out there, warriors.",

I have spent a good deal of money on camis, bras, etc. but none of them are doing the job.  I wear a C cup and my breasts want to squish together causing me to sweat and it is uncomfortable.  Since I can't wear an underwire bra, has anyone else had this problem and what is the solution?  I need \"the girls\" separated, if not lifted.   I read here where several of you were emotional the first day - when they applied the markers. I thought I was ready for treatment, had been cheerful and just ready to get started, but the day that the markers were applied I just could not hold back the tears.  I was just not prepared to be half naked with a man in the room....I know he has seen a zillion breasts but that didn't seem to matter.  I can't explain the feeling but I know what some of you are going through.  The therapist at Duke told me this week that there is nothing wrong with crying and I shouldn't care what people think....cry if you want to.  I think that is good advice. Looking forward to having this over.  I am staying in NC in the motel room during the week and coming home on weekends.  Three weeks to go.....Good Friday is my last treatment!!!",
