I had a diagnosis of 'fatty tissue' a month ago, and much as I wanted to accept the good news and move on, I haven't been able to. I didn't have a good experience at the breast clinic, and even before my biopsy results, didn't feel they had been very thorough. Since then the are has grown, the lumps are lumpier, I have new dimples and pain. Like you I just have a feeling that something more is going on in there. I have also made arrangements for a second opinion. The sensible advice is to say that whatever is going on with you, waiting until the end of April will probably not make much difference, if it's benign it wont do any harm, and if it's not then that few weeks probably wont cause significant changes. But that theory only adresses the physical changes that may or may not occur. Psychologically the story might be different. Can you mentally cope with waiting a few more weeks? If the answer is no, then try and bring your appointment forward. All new lumps should be checked out, no one is crazy for wanting peace of mind where their health is concerned and I'm sorry your doctor has made you feel that way. I am the least histrionic person I know, and my doctor made me feel like a hysterical wimp at the clinic. Not sure I can forgive that, my concerns are valid - as are yours. We should be able to have trust and confidence in our doctors and know that they have used evidence based procedures to make a diagnosis. Only then can we walk away calm and collected, or deal with what we have to deal with in a positive way. Good luck Eliza and take care.",

It's no wonder you're worried, anybody would be in your situation. Still, a large majority of biopsies come back with benign findings. It might be worth contacting the centre where you had your mammogram and ultrasound done and aksing them for copies of the findings - this might give you a better idea of what the doctor is expecting to find.

All we want is peace of mind, or to know what we have to deal with and it feels like an uphill battle. Two days ago I had a BS prod my rather prominent lump once with his index finger and tell me he didn't think it was anything to worry about - I then waited 2 hours for an ultrasound, they had forgotten me and had to call the radiologists back to see me. I was in the US room for a total of five minutes, four of which was spent undressing, lying on the table waiting and getting dressed again. He spent a total of 10 seconds scanning the lump and told me to get dressed, go back to the waiting room and wait for the surgeon to send me home. I asked him if he thought it was anything bad, he just said 'no' and walked out the room. I was so quick my sister, who was waiting with me, thought I'd forgotten something when I appeared back in the waiting area so quickly! I have to confess I burst into tears at that point - I've been carrying this 'thing' in my breast for months now, and as far as I am concerned it is guilty until proven innocent. At no point that day did either doctor tell me what they thought it might be, and even when I asserted myself with the surgeon he just said it was probably a fatty lump - I would like to know how he and the radiologist can tell that based on one prod of a finger and a ten second scan! As I am 45, massive family history of breast and ovarian, I thought I might at least get a mammogram that day. The surgeon did in the end do a FNA on the lump, and sent me on my way with a photocopied leaflet on how to do BSE ( really????). The worst of it was - when I complained to the nurse about what I felt was really shabby treatement I was told they were busy that day due to having to catch up from last weeks cancelled clinic. SO...does that mean that my hasty assessment was due to the lump being benign in appearance and not requiring proper imaging, or because the clinic was playing catch up and didn't have time? Anyway, the point of me telling you all that is to say that I know how you feel - like they are not taking you seriously and giving you the reassurance that all of us so desperately need by just finding out what the heck is growing in your boob and what you can do about it. I am so stressed I feel sick. I empathise, I really do :( Hubby's response to all this is - go private, buy their time, get the tests. I am inclined to say the same to you - if paying for an MRI will give you peace of mind, do it, but be prepared that MRI finds an awful lot of mostly benign things that might raise your anxiety rather than lower it. It sounds to me like you need to have this area of abnormal cells found, re tested and clarified. Is it worth paying for a private consult, explaining your concerns and getting a second opinion on what's going on in there? I am in the UK, a consult mammo/ultrasound etc is much cheaper than getting a private MRI. It might reassure you more than an MRI lighting up like a christmas tree and scaring the heck out of you because it thinks every little cyst is a problem. I say this because i had one a few years ago which found a 'mass' the size of a coke can on my ovary - highly suspicious etc etc - turned out to be a cyst - the stress of it all was more life threateneing to be honest. I really feel for you right now - this is a bad place to be in your mind, none of us want our boobs to dictate our lives and occupy every thought. There's a good chance that this new thing you have found, the long lump, might be a Coopers ligament - but you need an expert who you can trust to tell you yay or nay. I don't suppose I have been of much help, but know I am listening, I get it and I will be thinking of you.",

On that lovely BSE leaflet they gave me, it says that ALL new lumps should be checked - but you are right, it is madness. My sister had a recall from her first mammo and was told that her boobs look like a couple of bags of peas she has so many cysyts in them! She says that if she reported every new one she would have to take a sleeping bag to the breast clinic and take up residence. All joking apart though, it really is no fun trying to decide which lump to be concerned about. If I do go private for a more thorough check, I will be going well out of area - I'm really not keen to give that particular surgeon my hard earned cash so he can give me the time he should have given me on the NHS! Given what you've said, maybe an MRI would give you peace of mind and find that area. What price sanity eh? As for my lump, it is very definitely solid - I did get a quick glimpse at my notes that told me that much, it also feels rock hard and has ridges. It doesn't move and it is poking out of my left boob. I don't know about the results of the FNA, I have to ring the Breast Nurse in a few days for the results. I must admit I expected them to do a core biopsy on it ( not that I was relishing that experience) - but none of the women i talked to at clinic that day got a core biopsy as the staff were playing catch up. I was just told I would be called back if necessary. I came out of there feeling like I had wasted everyones valuable time. Anyway, thanks for asking - it means a lot :) I really hope the GP can point you in the right direction for getting your issue resolved, I will keep my fingers crossed!",

Like everything biological, things don't always behave or present in expected ways. At the very least they will be taking some biopsies, and may recommend surgical excision to be on the safe side. I imagine the 4b rating has been applied because there is flow, and the lesion is not fully circumscribed. There can be lots of innocent reasons for that. Multilobulated tends to be a benign sign, as does oval shape ( malignant lesions tend to create scar tissue formation, hence spiculated or irregular appearances) microlobulated is a more worrisome presentation. Lets hope they just find an awkward looking fibroadenoma! I do know that a large majority of BIRADS 4 directed biopsies will come back benign despite their odd presentation. Out of interest, has this popped up in the same place as the previous fibroadenoma? just thinking that if they left a bit behind, becuase it was done by core needle biopsy rather than excision - it might be the same one.

Once it is out properly, lets hope it solves the problem. The odd thing about fibroadenomas is that they are made up of over excited breast cells that have gone haywire - it's like a breast within a breast. From what I can gather it's quite rare that they turn nasty, but as they are made up of ordinary breast cells they have the same likelihood as any other cell of being malignant. There are lots of stages of cell change before malignancy occurs, so even if this lump is behaving badly and has decided it needs its own blood supply, theres still a very good chance it's still non malignant. I'm glad your doctors are being thorough and getting it out for you. I wish we could speed up time for you, and get you a week past your surgery with the answers you need :( Sigh.

I have a few options for you - first you can rquest a second opinion from your GP, and this referral can be made to a different breast clinic than the one you have been attending. Alternatively you can ask your GP to refer you fro a private mammo, which will cost around £200. The best test you could have in the absence of a palapable lump, would be an MRI.  Privately they are around £1000, and the NHS really doesn't like giving them away. The bottom line is, only a triple assessment can diagnose what is going on in your breast, it doesn't sound like you have ever been given a biopsy - and if this is the case, they will likely say that they have nothing to biopsy - in which case, in order to complete the triple assessment they need to do an MRI, which is the only imaging likely to detect subtle problems in your boob. For instance ILC. It is more than likely that you do not have BC, but you do need to have this proven to you given your symptoms. I would recommend contacting PALS at the hospital which governs your breast clinic - make a formal complaint that you have not recieved a diagnosis in all the time you have been attending, tell them you feel you need further evaluation like a mammo or an MRI and that you are not satisfied with the standard of care you have recieved so far - you never know, they might just pull the stops out for you. The doctor you have seen CANNOT tell you you don't have BC unless she has completed the triple test and clinically proved it to within 100%.",

However...I'm pretty sure you can self refer for a mammo, only a screening one, but better than nothing. I looked at London Breast Clinic, Bupa, Nuffield and Spire health care. There is also a clinic in London ( london bridge I think) that does MRI's from £200, but I think you need a referral from GP for a breast MRI. You could still request a second opinion at a different hospital - that's what I did.

Because your breasts are dense things don't show up too clearly on a mammo - very common in younger women. The BIRADS 4 means that though they can see something, they don't know exactly what they are looking at, so they need further tests to confirm the nature of the 'lumps'. In this case probably a biopsy which should explain exactly what's what. If they had found something that was entirely suspicious for malignancy the score would have been 5. As for the 'subcentimeter asymmetry', they are recommending a more focused mammo and and ultrasound to investigate further.

Here's my tale. Around eight weeks ago i found a hard, irregular lumpy area in my left breast in the lower, inner quadrant.It felt like several lumps had melded together. It didn't hurt in and of itself, but the whole breast became more sensitive as soon as i noticed it - shooting pains, tenderness, pain in the armpit, down my arm etc. The lumpy area didn't change throughout a full menstrual cycle, so i went to the GP, who got another doctor to feel the area. They decided to refer me to the Breast Clinic to get it checked out. Like most people, i was hoping to be told it was a normal change and that it was nothing to worry about - so the prospect of a referral was quite scary. Did that mean they suspected something dire? The anxiety began. I am 45, have a horrible family history of both breast and Ovarian cancer and used to work in medical research - not a good combination for an enquiring mind! I visited the breast clinic eleven days after referral, probably the most stressful eleven days I have spent for many a year, and I googled. I googled til I could google no more, and the single best resource for advice and information was this site. At the clinic I saw a consultant, got a very brief ultrasound and a biopsy. The clinic experience was not good, they were rushed, abrupt and very disrespectful of the terrifying ordeal having a breast mass evaluated can be. It was not a reassuring experience at all, and I left confused and upset and feeling like I had not been taken seriously at all. But thanks to the ladies on this site i was able to calm myself down and realise that the biopsy was the real key to what was going on. I got my results today, the area is benign, all cells are normal and the 'lump' is nothing to be concerned about. A huge relief, and a sense of sorrow and sadness for those women and men who don't recieve such good news. This site is a wonderful resource. Though my results are good, my lump is benign and I can walk away from here now, I will return and add what I can to help others through the awful time of waiting and wondering. I will also send my very best wishes, thoughts and prayers to those who did not get such a good result. Thank you to everyone who contributes here.",
