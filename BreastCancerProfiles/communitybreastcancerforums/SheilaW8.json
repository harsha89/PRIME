I have a rash all over my body, apparently from the Oxy for pain. The end of my nipple is black and the doc said I have an area of skin on the side of my breast that is dying. I'm worried to death what is going to happen to me. Off to see the plastic surgeon on Monday for her to have a look and see if we need to postpone the mastectomy on the 24th. Any one else have any problems like this?",

      "Content": "Jan 2, 2017 06:51PM - edited Jan 2, 2017 06:53PM by SheilaW8 I was officially diagnosed with DCIS on October 6 after finding a lump in my left breast. Two radiologist and my breast cancer surgeon all are suspicious of IDC, though all pathology reports say DCIS. I'm scheduled for the first phase of surgery (nipple sparring & Lymph node) on January 10 and a left breast mastectomy with reconstruction on January 24. I have had 2 biopsies with 3 areas biopsied. All 3 came back cancerous. I go for pre op tomorrow. The wait for me has been terrible. I am an emotional wreck. I am horrified at the thought of all of this. Prayers to all of you and may God help us all through this!",
