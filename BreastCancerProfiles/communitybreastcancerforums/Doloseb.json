My doctor explained that it works differently from the past chemo I have had. It works on the molecular structure of cells rather than killing both good and bad cells. I sure hope I begin to see a reduction of fluid soon. Counts look good and hair slowly coming out. I have had many different chemo treatments over the last almost 20 years. I am so thankful to still be here and thriving. Onward and upward!!",
