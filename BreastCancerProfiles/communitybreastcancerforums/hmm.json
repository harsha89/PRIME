These were for the serious ones like heart damage which ended up not being an issue as it was my right breast that had rads. So one by one we went over any other possible things that could happen which of course I had asked Dr. Goggle and when I realized the percentages were very low I went with it. Plus I was not wanting more surgery at the time. However......................... many times I think ............hmmmm why did I not just do it!!!!! Meaning of course mast. with reconstruction!!!!  With the radiaiton itself I did not have any problems ........my skin just got pinkish and then a bronze color but nothing bad. Used lotions 3 or 4 times a day and stayed hydrated as they said to. So it was okay...or as okay as these things can be. Hope this was of some help. Pat ",

October is usually still pretty warm if not hot in Orlando. Between when the children go back to school and Thanksgiving is one of the slower times so that should work very well for you. Sometimes when it is very busy the wait times are such that it takes way too long to do the different things and most likely you won't have to deal too much with that. As for Universal it is actually two parks................... the one with all the thrill rides is called Islands of Adventure............the other is Universal Studios and that does not have the thrill rides. As for the Space Center you may want to go to their web and decide for yourself as you know what your children enjoy. It will be such fun! Pat   ",
