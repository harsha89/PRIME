The reason why it felt so hard is because it was so tiny. It is not a large, squishy lump that was easily determined to be fluid filled, so the ultrasound was the final determination that it was nothing ominous. Confirmed that I do have very dense breasts, ESPECIALLY one side. One breast is twice as dense/lumpy as the other. I now know what a mammogram feels like and have baseline images for future scans. (It wasn't as bad as folks say they are.) :-) Good luck to all of you.",

I am charting my temps to ensure I'm still ovulating and my hormones are still working, and so far, they are. I noticed late last week a lump in my left breast, about 2\" away from my nipple toward my armpit. It's aching on its own, and when I touch it it's incredibly tender and sore (much like a large acne on your face hurts, or like my breasts felt all over when they were engorged while breastfeeding). I have very, very small breasts -- always have (barely an A cup). The lump is pretty close to the surface. It is somewhat firm, a bit smaller than a green pea, and slides ever so slightly under my finger if I press it. Feels almost like a lymph node when one is enlarged in your neck. Both breasts have been achy this weekend as I know my cycle is starting (I would have started my period yesterday or today). Sometimes I feel a sharp pain in one breast or armpit area (bilateral; varies). Both breasts are ropey and dense and bumpy (much like feeling a firm sea sponge under my skin), but my left breast has always been slightly larger, slightly lumpier and always more sore. My mom, grandmother, and aunt all have fibrocystic breasts. My mom has calcifications and, a few years ago, even had a spot seen on mammogram that was biopsied -- it came back fine. The only instance of breast cancer in my entire family, both sides, is my maternal great-grandmother, who had a cancerous lump removed when she was in her late 70s-early 80s (stage 1) and recovered completely. Called my GYN and the nurse told me to take Vitamin E (800 mg) for 7 days and come in and get checked if lump doesn't reduce or still hurts. Today is day 3 on Vitamin E, and evidently day 2 into my cycle, and I can't tell it's reduced at all. Still very sore. Should I be expecting the lump to go away immediately when cycle starts, or does it sometimes go down slowly through the week? Am I jumping to conclusions too fast? I have never had a discernible lump that feels different and somewhat \"alone,\" just the general \"bumpiness\" that is in most of the sides and bottoms of my breasts. I have never had a mammogram (I am 38). Nothing past exams done by myself and my GYNOB. I am new to all of this. Thanks everyone. Log in to post a reply",
