Stge 1, grade 2.  I have taken advise from my BS do radiation .. Rad Onc. advised  radio for 25 days plus  5 days of boost,   I have four more boosts to go and then that is it.. and as i am post menopausal started on Aridimex 1.1.09 for five years.. I am also on yearly mammo and Ultra sounds for the rest of my Life.. The rads. is to kill any tiny slippery little B^&%%*&^ that might still be around..  I think a second opinion is certainly worth it.. all the best  Treetop.",
