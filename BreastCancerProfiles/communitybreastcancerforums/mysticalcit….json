I think everyone needs to evaluate and make decision that seems best for them. Although I am not sure maximizing all treatments is always best. Because some studies have shown even chemo can inadvertently encourage cancer growth, outside of the secondary cancers. \"Nelson and colleagues examined cancer cells from prostate, breast and and ovarian cancer patients who had been treated with chemotherapy, and found specifically, that when the DNA of fibroblasts near the tumor is damaged by chemotherapy, they start producing a protein called WNT16B in the microenvironment of the tumor. And, they also found, when the protein reaches a high enough level, it causes cancer cells to grow, invade surrounding tissue, and resist chemotherapy.\" Amica, my friend like you had all the treatments available to her at the time when she first had breast cancer 24 years ago. She had mastectomy, radiation, chemotherapy and even a bone marrow transplant. Not quite sure why they did transplant, but her treatment was aggressive. Followed by 5 years tamoxifen. She also was told she was at low risk for recurrence, but she now has had a recurrence to bones after 24 years. So at the end of the day I don't think any of the studies are long enough and robust enough to know who will have a recurrence or not.",
