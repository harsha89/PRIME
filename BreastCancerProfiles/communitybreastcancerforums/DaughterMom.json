      "Content": "DaughterMom wrote: I am so annoyed with my mother's dr. today.  Sorry if this sounds like a rant from the get go. Mom's lower back pain has been more evident over the last few days.  She is taking a 12 hour slow release pain killer, and 4mg hydromorphone for breakout pain.  The prescriptions says take 1 pill 3 times a day, this does not seem to work anymore.  She took a pill at 10:30 this AM, but by 12:30, the pain was still there.  We turned on the heating pad, and I called Kevin the pharmacist (he is so sweet, and knows about mom's condition) to see if she could take another pill, even though it was still early.  My gut feeling was that my mom could take a pill, but she is a \"nervous nelly\" and wanted to hear from a professional.  Kevin the pharmacist was not in, and the other pharmacist said she should WAIT, (in my opinion, wrong answer) and should only take one every 6 hours!  She also said mom could be building a resistance to the hydromophone and should get her dr. to increase the prescription.  Augh.  I called her doctor next, and I was amazed I even got to speak to her, I said \"Mom's pain meds are not working\", she said \"I'll increase the prescripton\"  I said\" Thank-you\" I went on to explain our current situation, when all of a sudden the phone started beeping at me....she hung up!  OMG!  I was furious!!!! My mother needed to hear from a trained professional that she was not over-dosing herself by taking a pain med too early!!  Her doctor recently won an award to outstanding community service, my god, she could not even take a minute to hear me out!!  So much for serving the community. That's my rant. BUT, if anyone is taking hydromorphone 4mg, how often do you take it?  I also realized that mom was delaying her 12hr pill if she just recently took a breakout or what we call an \"in-between\" pill.  I told her to take her 12 hr. pill at precisely 12hrs apart, I suggested 8am and 8pm, regardless of when she took an inbetween pill. Hopefully it was good advice?  I will be reminding her from now on. I think I will pay a visit to Kevin the pharmacist.   I have no idea if her dr. will even remember to increase the dosage.  I have no faith in that dr. anymore.   Hope is the thing with feathers, That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all. -Emily Dickenson Log in to post a reply",

I am now staying with her during this ordeal, just looking after her. I have not told anyone about this lump that I found. When I phoned home and spoke to my husband, I had every intention to tell him, but I just couldn't. I don't want to instill any unnessessary fears in my family. The earliest mammo appt. we could get was FEB 4TH! (My mother lives in a smallish city) My Dr. decided to call the next nearest city (1.5 hr drive) and I have an appt. on January 14. This is the day before my mothers first appt with an Onc. at the Cancer Centre in the same city. I will have to somehow sneak away to my mammo appt.

I hate it when doctor's make patients wait.  My mother's GP always seems to be overbooked, to the point of ridiculous.  The last time we went to see her, I asked the nurse how long it would be, because mom cannot sit up for more than an hour, and she told me that there were four patients in front of her, and they were all getting full physicals. I asked if we could just sneak in between patients, because we just has a couple questions and needed a prescription refill, and promised that my sweet mother would not take too much of the doctor's precious time.  ",

I will study the body language and facial expressions of the technicians like crazy.  I am a little stressed about this, because mom is currently in the hospital, she needed another blood transfusion. The Dr.'s understand the importance of her appt. at the Cancer Centre, so they will be releasing her tomorrow.  I am packing for our little excursion tomorrow,  and will pick her up at the hospital on the way out of town.  I told mom about my appt., but not about the lump.  She believes that I am just being precautious.  I just don't need her worrying about me, when she is so ill right now. ",

I was just shaking during the whole ordeal.  I swear to god, my heart was pounding so hard again the mammo machine that my whole body was moving with each heartbeat, I was thinking they would not get a clear scan, but it was probably just my imagination.  I don't know why, but I am all of a sudden getting very overwhelmed by all that is happening.  I am a strong person, why the heck am I crying?!  I haven't heard anything from my Dr. yet, but they said that they would send him the results within 24hrs.  I am calling the dr's office first thing.  I guess, the next step could possibly be a biopsy.  Madalyn:  The technicians where emotionless...other than kindly concern.  Couldn't \"read\" a thing from them!

Mom had her first radiation treatment yesterday, and she is such a trooper!  She did so well, and is so brave.  I was a nervous wreck, but tried very hard to hide it.  The technicians sensed it, and let me watch on the monitors, and explained step by step what they were doing.   Immediately following radiation, she went to the Vascular dept. and had the Nephrostomy tubes inserted.  It was a tough day.  ",

      "Content": "DaughterMom wrote: My mother had her first appt. yesterday at the Cancer Centre in Saskatoon. The first doctor we met with was a radiologist and his RN.  They were amazing.  The first thing he wanted to be sure of was that mom really understood her diagnosis.  Which she does.  She has mets to her lung, liver and abdomen (not bone as I originally thought).  She also knows that the outcome of any threatment is for a better QOL.  The radiologist focused mostly on the mass that is causing her the most problems, her abdomen.  She has a blockage from her kidney and bladder, which is serious, she is starting to get swelling to her feet and now her arms and hands.  Mom agreed to allow the doctors to place a stint (stent?) in her urinary tract, and undergo 10 sessions of radiation treatments.  The treatments will start ASAP.  He will call us when we have to go back to Saskatoon.  Probably as early as next week.  My biggest relief is that the doctor decided that mom should be admitted to the hospital for the treatments.  This will make it easier for my mom and myself.  We don't have to worry about staying at the hostel (or what ever it is called, a home away from home for patients undergoing treatments) and traveling back and forth to the hospital everyday for two weeks.  I just pray that mom can somehow find the strength to endure this treatment.  I know that it will take a lot out of her, and she is so weak as it is.  But, in the long run, the risk of not getting this done now is far greater.  Today mom was saying that she is feeling really good about the upcoming treatment, and glad that she will be in the hospital.  She gets really good care in the hospital here in her hometown, so I am sure in a larger city, the care will be just as good.     Hope is the thing with feathers, That perches in the soul, And sings the tune without the words, And never stops at all. -Emily Dickenson Log in to post a reply",
