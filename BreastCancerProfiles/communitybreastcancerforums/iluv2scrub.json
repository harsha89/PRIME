For those of you just starting chemo...please feel free to send me a private message - I used that a lot because I found it difficult to follow some threads - I'll blame it on chemo-brain hahaha...I earned it so I'm claiming it!  Chemo is do-able...it sucks and there are a lot of side effects to deal with but it's all do-able!  Hang in there!  Happy to private message or email anytime!

My FNA results were \"on time\" but then my post op report was two days later than the surgeon said. I had surgery on a Friday (Feb.1) and expected results Wed. I called Wed. afternoon..and called Thurs. at noon...and called Fri. a.m. to find the office closed!!! I PAGED the surgeon! I got a call within 30 min. and they explained there were two reports they had wait for and mine would be ready by 3:30...then finally...Friday of last week I learned I need chemo. Waiting from Wed to Fri just about killed me. We do have to advocate for ourselves. I hope you get your results soon! I know the waiting is so hard! But I am traveling this cancer road and stop-lights are something I have to get used to...now I know I need chemo but am waiting to see the oncologist to find out what my cocktail will be...I want to start today but I can't...baseline PET and bone scans, port placement and waiting for appointments. So so so hard to wait at these stoplights when I want to keep driving. Advocate for yourself in a professional manner and keep your head held high...I wish you good news but if it is not, we are here for you! (Hug)",
