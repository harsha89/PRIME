Why do doctors dismiss lumps in breasts as if they know for sure it's benign without doing a biopsy? About 3 - 4 months before my diagnosis, I had a painful, swollen node in the groin area. My neurologist was concerned after viewing the node via ultrasound (I was being checked for blood clots in my legs.) don't want to add to your concerns, but I wanted to share my experience.

July 12th I had my 3rd infusion and the side effects are growing. First, aweful leg pain and fluid retention. These have calmed down, but today I noticed my eyelids are swollen and it's painful to open my eyes so I've been squiinting all day. In addition, I have rectal bleeding probably from constipation/hemmoroids/ fissure. (Sorry if that's TMI). My concern is that the blood is in clots. I had a colonoscopy in April of this year and it was clear. All of this makes me want to skip the last chemo treatment, but I won't. Thanks ladies for allowing me space to vent my concerns. When I'm able I'll catch up. In the meantime, do you think I should call the onc who's on call or wait until Monday and call the office?Â ",
