I am now comfortable seeing the doc I picked, now just have to wait for the appointment which I'm sure will drive me nuts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!         the lump just seems weird, to have it for almost 3 months and not painful/tender at all until now. it seems it started when I had the bra off and they were hanging lol. maybe it look 3 months to become cycle related??? who knows guess I will find out soon enough. thank you all again so much, it is greatly appreciated.",
