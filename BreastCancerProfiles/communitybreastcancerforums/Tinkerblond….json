Every day (including the first) after a few hours the breast being treated feels much hotter than the rest of my body and on the \"rest\" day Saturday my entire body was feverish. After day 2 I spoke to the nurse who recommended aloe gel and ibuprofen and I was lucky enough to have been given Miaderm as a gift. It seems that every day my breast feels more and more inflamed even using all of the above. It's the same feeling as when I quit nursing my kids. Is this normal for anyone else?",
