My sister is a BC survior of 15 years but today I got a call from my neice to say my sister has found another lump and is waiting for tests to be done. I havent told any of my family about the last few weeks...including my daughter, we are waiting until we see the surgeon on Friday and will tell at the weekend when we skype...but now I dont know if to mention it to my neices' and sister....so I am sitting here with what is a diagnosis but no knowledge of the actual results and feeling in kind of limbo..... I was looking for information on other stuff when I stumbled on this site  and read some of the inspiral stories.  I wasnt sure if to post or what to say but figured I have nothing to loose and at least a place to let off steam Log in to post a reply",
