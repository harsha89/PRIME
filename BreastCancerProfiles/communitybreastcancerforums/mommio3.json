    "Content": "mommio3 wrote: Hi all, I am writing on behalf of my mother who is almost 73.  She has developed a very red and sore breast, starting at base of nipple and extending to base of breast.  She says it is very painful, and she is also running a low grade fever (99.9-100.4).  She was given antibiotics yesterday, and after 24 hours has not noticed mcuh change or alleviation of pain.  When she saw her doctor yesterday, the doc also scheduled an appointment w/ a surgeon 10 days from now.  When I asked my mother why the appt. w/ the surgeon, she said, I don't know, it could be a cyst or something.  I have not discussed IBC w/ my mom (don't want to freak her out just yet), but I knew of someone who had IBC - so I am obviously concerned.  I realize that the fever may be a sign of infection, but from all that I have read, mastitis is common in younger women (nursing moms), and cysts are rather unlikely after menopause.  I love my mom dearly, and this is all I can think about right now.  Can someone let me know if IBC ever presents w/ a fever?  I was not at my mothers appointment yesterday, but I plan to be at the appointment w/ the surgeon, and I want to ask ALL the right questions and make sure no stone is left unturned.  Thank you for this lovely discussion board.  God bless you all.  My prayers are with all of you who are either worried (like me!), fighting or sharing and caring.
