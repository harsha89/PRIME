I began chemo 11/09 and had last infusion 4/5/10.  Just 2 weeks out from lump +AND (5/12) and supposed to start rads in June.  I did 4 cycles of gemzar, taxotere, and avastin followed by 4 cycles of AC (first 2 with avastin) through a clinical trial.  Well, after surgery the clinical trial calls for 10 additional doses of avastin.  Has anyone had avastin as a single agent? And if so, how were the SE's if any? My Med Onc says that it is a \"breeze and easy\" compared to the combo chemo I previously had.",
