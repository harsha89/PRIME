To Sandy, you raised a beautiful daughter who touched the lives of so many here on the boards. Her avatar with the picture of her husband and kids always brought a smile to my face. I hope you take some comfort in knowing how much Shelli was loved. To Shelli's husband and children, my heart goes out to you. I wish you much strength to carry on and live the lives that Shelli had hoped to share with you.Geeta, thank you for always keeping us up to date on what was going on with Shelli. It must have been so hard to share this news of your dear friend's passing. My prayers are with all of you.",

I admire what she did, contributing her body for research to the UW. Perhaps they will learn from her something that will lead to a cure for breast cancer. My heart goes out to you, your sons, and your grandsons. May Diane live on forever in all of your memories. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Sue ",
