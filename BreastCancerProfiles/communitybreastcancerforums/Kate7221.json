    "Content": "Kate7221 wrote: I had a mammogram in October which showed a cyst in my outer right breast which has been there for quite some time. In February it got significantly bigger so I had another mammogram and ultrasound which came out normal however it has doubled in size since February so I had a appointment on Wednesday to have it drained. When they started to drain it there was blood in the fluid so they stopped and sent it out to cytology to be tested. I\u2019m nervous and wondering if anyone else had this happen.
