Histopathology report indicate that ADH/columnar cell atypia is focal.  previously, 4 core biopsy showed Proliferative breast disease with mild atypia. I was recommended now for a follow up in 3 months time but have to go to my surgeon right away if anything bothers me.  i thought 6 months is the common waiting period. right now, I'm still in shock and trying to digest what's going on even researching just to understand those words in my histopathology report. i'm a 46yo single and did try to have at least a healthy lifestyle to avoid this kind of situation but guess I'm wrong after all.  thanks ",
