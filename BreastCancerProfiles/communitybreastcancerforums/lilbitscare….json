I am scared that they are just not telling until I get there. I live 4 hours away, very long drive!! even longer drive back if it is bad news!!! if it is bad news, would they tell me over the phone, or would they wait until I am in the office??Â ",

I live in a very remote part of CA. That is why the 4 hour drive. This cancer cent came very highly recommended as did the doctor I am seeing. I just never exspected to have to wait this long to find out what is going on. I was told at the time of the tests that it would take a week to get the results as the radiologist wants all my test together at one time, and will give one BIG report. I called today, but have not heard anything yet. Still waiting on the radiologist!!",
