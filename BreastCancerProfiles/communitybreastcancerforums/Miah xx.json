Surgeon said alarm bells were ringing because the clear fluid is coming from one duct and I have an ezcema type rash and peeling. So I've been given steroid cream to use twice a day and I'm being called back in 4 weeks time to see if it's cleared up. If I'm still producing the discharge and/or the rash and peeling are still there, then I have to have a punch biopsy.  Does a punch biopsy hurt?  X Log in to post a reply",

They found papillomas and a few other benign conditions. Well, my left breast is at it now, but the discharge is bloody. Could it be that I've got papillomas in my left breast too? How common is it to have it in 2 breasts? I'm quite concerned and going to see doctor on Friday Log in to post a reply",
