My liver enzymes were normal even with liver mets, and did not elevate until recently. I worked as a laboratory technologist for 30 years, and we used to see very elevated liver enzymes(800's). Usually in the case of liver disease, more than one enzyme is elevated(ALT and ALP). Is it difficult to get a blood sample from you? A traumatic blood draw, or improper handling of the sample can also slightly elevate AST. Hard to say how long AST might stay elevated after infection or NSAID use. I'm still leaning towards the \"don't worry\" camp! I know your MO will shed light on this. Are you getting any therapy right now for the breast cancer? Best, MJH",

Some neurologists and neurosurgeons have the bedside manner of a gnat. 50's girl, I do not need to travel to Boston for treatment as we have two excellent medical centers in Portland, about 30 miles South of where I live. Gracie, I have tolerated my first two sets of Falsodex very well. My nurse is superb. I lean onto the exam table on both elbows and put one foot at a time up on the exam table step. Very comfortable posture, and I put my thoughts elsewhere or talk with my nurse. My bum just feels bruised after, but it's very tolerable. Last night was an interesting one for me. My DH is out of town visiting his 96 yr old Dad. I needed to transport my DD to an orientation for a college program she is entering. My eight year old grandson came along, as DH was not home. Anyway, it was freezing, and dark and rush hour, and I swear half of Boston has moved up to Portland! The community college is off one of the busiest avenues, we had never been there! UGH! Anyway, we made it, dropped her off and headed to one of our favorite places for a bite. We kind of rushed through the meal, and made it back to get her. Very convoluted route. The reason this is so significant is that my 32 yr old DD is going back to school! She graduated salutatorian of her class of 300, but in the spring of her junior year she became seriously ill with an eating disorder. For the next 13 years, she struggled with it, as well as alcoholism, narcotics addiction, and compulsive shoplifting. She has been in solid recovery for over two years, but I am here to tell you, IT WAS A FIGHT. I am so proud of her- not many people make it out of this alive. So, despite the conditions being a little dicey, it turned out to be a really positive experience for her. My grandson was a total trooper and we rode home happily in a warm car with Christmas music! Of course, I completely detest MBC and wish it to disappear in to the abyss of hell, but it is easier for me than having my daughter afflicted with what she has had. Posting some photos of Christmas at our house.... Love to each, may the force be with you MJH",

I hated feeling like I was slugging through jello all the time. As Micmel said- rising markers could be tumor flare, which is a good thing. I had my first scan 3 months after starting Ibrance and had a very strong response and I hope you do,too. Lynn(Man) I get why you don't just want to zip off for a weekend in Florida. it's a lot of travel for just a few days. I do better when things are planned in advance. I have always loved being at home, and DH likes being home as well. We go overseas every 2 years for two weeks, as we both do love European travel. I'm not sure I would have wanted to travel much when I was doing chemo back when first diagnosed in 2014. So, I hope you come to a decision that you are happy with. You deserve to be comfy! Grannax- glad you are better! Hope the trip to the grocery store was successful. If I remember correctly, you had to reschedule your scan? Micmel- did you make it through your eye appmnt and errands? I did not have a masectomy, so no reconstruction. It's such a personal decision. I can see why they didn't do it at the time of your surgery-Holy Cow! Your body would not have taken it. Claudia- hope the next CBC is better! Good luck with everything you've got going on! Thinking of everyone, hope you are feeling OK, and coping with MBC's insults- Love MJH",

No thanks! Popular here are receptions in refinished old barns, and also large tents near the water.

I am so touched by the fact that you have remembered that \"I am waiting\". May need to reschedule appmnt. now due to that mega Nor'easter coming in. Give me a break--not thrilled. Both pairs of wedding shoes are so exquisite! I am imagining you and DD looking beyond lovely on the big day. Glad your DH was able to sell the house-bittersweet. You two so deserve a new home together-so many sacrifices made. Very glad to hear that Bighome is OK and soldiering on. Sorry to hear of your brother. It must have felt good to commiserate. it's so hard to see a treasured sibling suffer. You want so much to help, but ultimately, they need to solve the issues and it's a helpless feeling. The gift is that you have one another to lean on. Magda and Grannax- guess there's a lot going on in real estate on this thread! Grannax, it must be gratifying to see DH moving into his new home. Will he backflip over the thresh hold? Magda- yay for you! Sounds as though things are going smoothly. Divine-I am sooo with you on exploring botanical gardens-we have a lovely one here in Maine. I have enjoyed so many over the years and they are so centering. Leapfrog-can hardly wait to check out your blog. it must feel so cathartic to be writing it all down. Mae-LOVED the jean photo! I wouldn't have expected less! The Lynnes- hugs! hope the New Hampshire gals are well! Minnie-best of luck tomorrow. Sorry you are being plagued with the damn sciatica-just what you need with everything else. Hugs! I am doing quite well managing the diabetes-pleased so far.

I have been referred to an Interventional radiologist to see about the Y90 procedure. Also getting referred somewhere for clinical trial with drug that targets the AKT1 mutation, which I have. So, I feel good about the plan. We'll see how it goes. Thank you all for your sincere support around this. I sort of suspected it, but progression is always a blow. I did have a mini meltdown about it; wondering things like \"Who will make sure my grandson's favorite pants are clean?\" Who will cook? Will I get everything cleared out and my affairs in order in time\" Will they be OK?

Gracie-hope the bone pain is not severe. I had it with the first chemo for Stage I and it was excruciating. I had to use narcotics for a few days.BigHome-from what i have read, the lower dose of Madame X should help. I have had some slight nausea and some abdominal cramping that is short lived, but all of it stinks! Nausea just shuts me down. Do you have Zofran? Have you tried nibbling candied ginger? Divine-grateful you have found the cause of your foot pain-glad they don't have to mess with it too much to fix it. Lynne(Man)- oh I remember those \"hell weeks\" and they are hard. I could enjoy food for about 7days and then went back for another round of the evil chemo. Thinking of all of you. Micmel-you are a growing concern to me. I agree with 50's girl about the depression. Are you currently taking an antidepressant? You seem to be in a deep hole of darkness that may be a bit challenging to crawl up out of. But it can be done! Much of how we deal with adversity in our lives depends on what shape we are in when presented with it. if you didn't get some of the tools in your childhood(no fault of your own), it maybe tricky to navigate life's ups and downs. I agree with Lynne also regarding having someone review your meds. Maybe a palliative care Doc? I had a summer years back when I could hardly keep my eyes open; I felt as though I was looking at the world through gray jello. It was dreadful. Don't know what helped, but it went away. i have been on an antidepressant for years and it completely helps. Why does cancer happen? My take on it is that it's just nature. it is the \"Emperor of All Maladies\" for sure. Is it the \"chemical soup\" in our environment? Who knows? Why did it happen to me? I think it is just random. I don't flog myself by repeating those questions. It is such a hard reality to accept, I know. I wish for you the courage to take one small step toward changing this debilitating pattern you are stuck in. Most of us know instinctively what we can do to help ourselves, but it can be hard to face. Saw an amazing performance last night of \"Beauty and the Beast\". So great and so much talent. Beautiful weather here, too. Loving summer! Making a meal of Chicken kebobs, new red potatoes, garden salad and peach crostada as our middle DD will join us. Grandson having a blast at camp this week. Love and sincere best wishes to each, Mary Jane",

The blood tests you listed are all studies performed to evaluate anemia. Your daughter may have a low red blood cell count, low hemoglobin and hematocrit. Quite commonly, anemias are caused by either Vitamin B12 or Iron deficiency. By measuring the levels of these in the serum, it can be determined which may be the culprit. Ferritin is an iron storing protein, and levels are lowered in iron deficiency anemia. TIBC stands for \"total iron binding capacity\" which helps look at iron stores in the blood, and will be elevated in iron deficiency. Same goes for %SAT, or percent saturation(of iron, Fe is chemical symbol for iron) UIBC determines availability of sites on Transferrin, a protein that carries iron throughout the body. Cancer treatments also are infamous for causing anemias because of suppression of blood cell synthesis. Hope this is helpful! love and hugs, MJH",

She can be treated with iron supplements. Iron deficiency anemia can be slow to respond to treatment, but you do get there. Many patients' bodies seem to adjust to anemia in the short term, but fatigue, shortness of breath, looking pale are all symptoms. (Yeah, great-just what your sweet daughter needs on top of everything else.) Was the Sodium level high or low? Sodium is one of those minerals that has a very narrow range in the blood(approx. 135-145 MEQ/L). It helps with nerve and muscle function. when it gets too high or low, it is a semi-acute situation which should be treated right away, and will generally resolve quickly. Hydration status can affect sodium levels. If your daughters' level is within your clinics' normal range, should be OK, but check with MO. Best of luck.

This is standard practice with larger tumors.They will stage the cancer after they do the surgery. it will depend upon tumor size, grade, and node involvement. I see that the biopsy must have shown Grade 3. THERE IS NO REASON TO THINK THAT YOU ARE STAGE IV! Your PET scan proves it! A bad cough that is making you wet your pants is most likely just that. When I get a cold, my cough can get so severe that I have to wear Depends! They are going to treat you very aggressively here in order to avoid Stage IV later. You have to take survival odds with a grain of salt. It varies so much between individuals. You are also very vulnerable right now and it's very easy to project what \"might\" happen in the future.

My diagnosis came when I had a CT with contrast looking for a possible blood clot due to the \"chest pain\". What side is the abdominal pain on? The right is where the liver is, of course, and I did feel tender in the right lower rib area when diagnosed with liver mets. How long have you had the pain? I think our rule here is if it doesn't go away in two weeks, go to your oncologist. Sounds as though you have already done this. Have they drawn serum tumor markers? The best advice I can give is not to let this drop until you feel satisfied. Have you seen your PCP? You know your body and you need to persist if the pain does not resolve on it's own. Best, MJH",

These are enzymes that rise with cellular damage to liver. There are several viruses that can cause elevated liver function tests as well. The most obvious being hepatitis,but also Epstein Barr(mono) and CMV. If you are still concerned, talk to your MO. Ask if you should have a hepatitis panel drawn. This could just be a passing thing.

My scan did show many active lesions, and a handful really lit up- maybe they are throwing off a lot of the tumor marker protein? My overall SUV's or glucose activity units, or whatever the heck they are, remained the same as I had in September, taking into account expected variation in measurement. ALP or alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme associated predominantly with liver and bone. When elevated in the blood, it indicates liver or bone damage. I'm surprised that all of us don't have increased ALP, considering the bone mets. Did Dani start the radiation? Seems like that could elevate the ALP. MO will probably shed light on that. CEA used to be used mostly to monitor colon and lung tumors, but other tumors can produce it also. Do many MO's order it?

Back in the day, two types of LD were used in diagnosing heart attacks. Two others of the five \"subtypes\" are implicated in liver disease. It can also be very elevated when a blood sample is extremely hemolyzed (blood cells rupture) due to traumatic collection. We would call that falsely elevated and would not report the result to the physician. We would request that the sample be redrawn. If there is some disruption in the liver, LD could be elevated, but could it also mean that the mets are being blown to kingdom come? I see that LD can also be used as a tumor marker, but I have no laboratory experience with that. Sounds like Dani's clinicians are not explaining this to you? Were there other abnormals seen in the blood work? It might be good to wait till the next blood work and see what the LD result is. Sorry to hear about your dear Uncle.

Go to the TapImmune website and scroll down to product info-you'll see a TPIV200 choice. The trial must be on cancer.gov, but I did not check. From what I read, results from the Phase I trial looked encouraging. Animalcrackers and Lindalou- thanks for piping up about the AKT1 mutation. I am still researching it. Animalcrackers, the trial you are starting is one of the ones that came up as a possibility on my lab report. I do live in Maine and am totally on board with traveling to Boston if necessary. My MO and I are in the early phases of deciding which trial I will do. The one that appeals to me is NCT02465060, with AZD5363. Pretty sure Dana Farber is also doing this one. It is also a Phase II. It is not exclusively for breast cancer. Lindalou, the AKT1 mutation seems to lie in between PI3K and mTor in the pathway regulating cell metabolism. So it makes sense that Everolimus would screw up whatever Mr. AKT1 was up to. I think a combination of therapies is recommended with AZD5363, so maybe both? or a hormonal as well.

Normal for serum creatinine is approx. 0.5-1.2 mg/dl, for serum BUN about 10-26 mg/dl. The ratio is the bun divided by the creat. At 0.35, Dani's creatinine would essentially be normal.

I suspect that it would be difficult to differentiate between the pain of the ovarian cyst and that of liver mets. it depends on size and location. You sure have a lot on your plate right now; no wonder you are feeling sad. it will get so much better when you get the information about the ovarian cysts. There are so many great treatments available for the liver mets! I am celebrating 2 years with them. just so many unknowns for you right now. The damn anxiety meter must be on overload. I am thinking of you and sending love and hugs. MJH",

They will do echocardiogram before Doxil to make sure your heart is strong, as Doxil can cause some damage. however, as Doxil is a liposomal form of adriamycin, which means it's a bigger molecule coated with fat that does less damage. If you had Adriamycin before, maybe your MO doesn't want to use Doxil? Best, Mary Jane",

I grew up with cats and dogs as pets, but husband #1 was allergic, and DH was lowest on the totem pole with his 1st wifes' pets. i have become accustomed to living without them, but miss them. Grannax, my parents had a \"cut down\" oak coffee table just like yours! My sister has it now. So many memories around that table! Coloring, eating Christmas breakfast by the tree! Claudia! Thank heavens for your stability! One thousand Hallejulahs! Mae, so sad about your childhood friend. Could have easily been my daughter, but she made it out, thank the powers that be. Enjoy what sounds like a lovely trip. Safe travels! I have had some interesting and encouraging news. Results of my genomic testing showed that I have an \"actionable mutation\". This is a Tier II class, which means there are currently no FDA approved drugs against the mutation. However there is a drug being tested in clinical trials that targets my particular mutation. My MO is really enthused and pleased. And, there is a trial in Portland,Me. 30 minutes away! So this will likely be my next treatment, either after Fulvestant or with. Very promising. I am convinced that there will be more and more targeted treatment available for all of us! Micmel- with bone mets only, you are going to stable for years! And yes, the Ibrance made me sooooo tired! But worth the price of admission! and I also felt like I was slugging through jello most days. Had a family party with our three DD and two grandchildren last night! So nice! Everybody brought food. We had Zuppa Toscana soup, cheeseburger sliders, baked brie, fresh fruit salad, gingerbread cupcakes and cranberry prosecco! Yum. To everyone, you are in my heart as we live with despicable disease. i admire your strength, wisdom, humor and courage! LOVE MJH",

Search for \"burgundy and marsala bouquets\". Unbelievable! I think Dahlias will be in bloom in September? Wow! Those linen prices are outrageous. Guess they charge so much-because they can. Isn't uncanny how easy it is for us to offer strength and comfort to those we love when they breakdown about our disease? It must have been so heart rending to watch DH experience that level of pain. I'm in hopes that it also offered some catharsis and relief for both of you. 50's girl has been posting on some other threads. Minnie- best of luck with the cardiac imaging today and scan results tomorrow. So emotionally draining. Thinking of you. Divine-sorry to hear of your sister. It catches us so off guard when an anchor in our lives becomes ill or incapacitated. I'm thinking of you and in hopes that your sister is on the mend. Mae- what a fabulous cabin! Thanks for the great photos! When my sisters' DH was stationed in Abilene, we went to a park where you drive through and see African animals. It felt like the moon to me-such a different terrain. The giraffes put their heads right in the window and stuck out their purple tongues. Emus aggressive and my little nephew knew to become one with the floor mat!! Gracie-think of you often. Is this your week off from Ibrance? I had weird pains sometimes during that week. and also at random; it usually simmered down on it's own. i took Ibuprofen/tylenol and used heating pad. Keetmom-Ugh on the jaw neuropathy. Must be uncomfortable. BUT, yay on the F1 results! Another potential weapon against this damnable disease.Must feel great to have DD feeling well. Blueshine-Hello! Enjoy your posts. Tanya-Chicken soup for your Granddaughter? How absolutely perfect. I love my grandson so acutely! I know the drill on the hot flashes and sweats-such a royal pain in the backside...You and DH will have such a special time when he retires! So well deserved! Bighome -worrying and hope you and DH are OK. Grannax-the image of the Caddy that runor posted was whimsical and had me smiling.

But I consider it a win for me and it makes me laugh in a sneaky way when I remember it later. Soooo, I see that you did buy a Caddy! and what a beauty! Ooooh, you so deserve that smooth gangstah ride!!! Lynne(Man) Nice weekend at Loon? I never learned to downhill ski, but took up X-country like a fiend in college. Many happy hours on trails in ME/NH/VT. I have not been since DX. Like you- I'll read! Hope your pain is controlled and tolerable just now. Runor-you really did nail it with the Caddy image! Sunflower-come to Maine in early October for an amazing foliage display. Return in winter and view a couple of our lighthouses in the snow, stay in the mountains in a cabin. Come in summer and eat lobster by the ocean. Then-GO HOME! We don't have much of spring and winter is waaay too long. There are downsides to the four seasons!

First a visit with friends in Connecticut for a long weekend. Grandson enjoyed rambling around our friends' farm and playing with his friend Chloe, also 8 yrs. old. I had planned Tuesday as a down day, but ended up all morning at PCP's office and all afternoon picking up a new car we had ordered. We were to be on a train to Boston at 7:30 the following morning for a family trip to the aquarium. It was 70 degrees and a super fun day! This morning I had a coffee date with my friend who had been away visiting her elderly mother in England. Grandson went to this awesome camp at a local college for the day. Soooo, I had requested to have blood drawn for a fasting blood sugar the first week of February. I had noticed it rising a bit last fall before I stopped having the Ibrance related blood work.(no mention of this from any MD) I had been feeling fatigued, tired, and thirsty. Duh! Yeah, blood sugar off the wall and now I am diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. To say that it has been a complete calamity trying to get set up with insulin, glucose meter, etc. is a gross understatement. I won't even bore you. Good thing I am a medical person and know the system somewhat. Now, as far as cancer care goes......well, guess what? PET scans use a labelled glucose tracer and if your blood sugar is too high (>200), PET will probably be rescheduled. I was due to have PET scan tomorrow to determine after 4 MONTHS if this flipping Falsodex is working. I am working with PCP to bring sugar down quickly and have rescheduled PET for next Friday. When I first got the diagnosis on Valentine's Day, I was completely flipping out about the PET scan thing. I'm better now. And.....another piece of charming information is that the experimental drug that is in trials for the particular mutation I have causes elevated blood sugar! YAY!!! So that will probably require strict monitoring. Hopefully Falsodex is working and trial drug won't happen for a while. Also, I dropped sugar and white flour like a hot potato. I have been feeling really well. I did great walking around Boston! For this I am so grateful. Bighome- I am searching the depths of my consciousness to figure out why in hell you would be exposed to that horrendous accident that claimed two lives after all that you are going through. No words. Micmel- I see you are in the throws of a huge scary decision, and I'm sending you strength for clarity and anxiety control. Tanya-excellent news! Mag-Hello! Don't think we've met! Grannax, the Lynnes, Leapfrog,Minnie, Mae, Lynnwood, Runor, Blueshine, and all of you other dear souls- I hope you are comfy and peaceful. May the force be with you. Love, MJH",

Thank-you Grannax, Lynn(MAN), Tanya, 50's girl, Micmel for the lovely support around the diabetes. I am coping very well. Experimenting with insulin doses till we get it right. it is painless to check the blood sugars and to administer the insulin. PET scan scheduled for next Friday. My PCP is terrific. Feeling slight hints of spring here and it's making me giddy! Started taking longer walks to help the diabetes and overall health. Not feeling severe fatigue and bone aches right now so am grateful for that. Micmel-what a lot you have endured. You are a WARRIOR! Lot's going on with you just now. Hope Stepdad's tests turn out normal... Lynne(Man)- Knowing how gorgeous New Hampshire is, your rides out in the Mini and the trike must be so great. Mae-love the overalls! You are such a cool person! Good luck nursing the hubby! My experience is that they are wimpy when sick, though I did read somewhere that men feel pain more acutely than women. Grandson is chafing to go outside, so I will post again later. Love to each, MJH",

The only good thing about a flipping colonoscopy is how perfectly delicious your meal tastes after it's over. May the force be with you. Micmel- the weather is improving here, getting some temps in the 50's. The ugly snowbanks covered in mud and gravel are the thing i dislike the most this time of year. Been thinking of you as Friday nears-go off the radar, get through it, and heal! We'll be here rooting for you and waiting for your return. Mae- Isn't this just a revolting development?-MBC-the gift that just keeps on giving.Thinking of you as you process the MRI results, and so thankful that the new lesions are small. As you said, very treatable. But still, MBC just sucks, plain and simple. Lynne(50's)-Thanks for inquiring about my new regimen. Been taking the Xeloda for six days and haven't really noticed any side effects. I am prepared for some hand and foot issues as the drug accumulates, however. I need this to work, so hoping for the best. Consulting in the morning at Maine Med.Center about possible Y90 procedure. So pleased you have had such a peaceful time in Florida; it really is starting to hint of spring in NE Lynne(Man) OMG, are you kidding? 26 people? I would be laying rubber to get the hell out of Dodge...I hope that everyone brings something, and not just some wimpy store bought rolls, but their very best dish... You deserve to have others do everything! You are a storm trooper! There will just be 4 of us, and I will do an indoor egg hunt for my grandson. Hannaford has those nice spiral hams on sale-so easy. I'll be thinking of you as you cope with the onslaught! Gracie-you are sounding much more chipper! Love it. You have suffered tremendous loss, and been such a caregiver-no wonder you have felt so drained and despairing. Hope spring brings you many peaceful and happier days. Tanya-big hugs! Loving the photos! Minnie-thinking of you! Magda-check in when you can and to all of you other dear ones, may the force be with you..... Best, MJH",

We have a beautiful AIR B&B studio apartment right on Mallett's Bay in Lake Champlain. We brought our grandson over to visit his father(total loser) and other grandmother(nice lady). Grandson has been asking to see them, and we do it in order to help him in becoming an intact human being. They do not make any effort, other than sending him a giant package at Christmas. With my daughter being more like a big sister to him, DH and I are in effect his parents. DD loves him like crazy, but does not function as parent. She is doing great in school though, and I have hopes for her future success. Anyway, makes a nice get away for us. Started my second cycle of Xeloda, and got my dates for the Y90 procedure. My sister from Florida will be visiting from 4/25 thru 5/9, and y90 stuff starts on May 22. A little nervous, but really convinced that I want the procedure. Sending love to each-MJH ",

Pain in right side almost non existent now; will see how recently drawn tumor markers look. not sure when I'll be scanning again as Y90 is looming(May22,29). Looking forward to planting veggies and flowers in our sizable garden. Have started Zinnia and Brandywine tomato seedlings. Here in Maine, we do not plant until end of May to avoid any possibility of frost. Grandson now participating in baseball, which is a whole lot of fun. He is quite the little slugger!

Tough week of testing, I know. It's always great to get it over with and return to one's normal home routine. I know you loved the extra day with DH; it will be the best when you two live under the same roof permanently. Your bouquet of the roses and tulips sounds so pretty and I'm sure the candy didn't hurt your feelings a bit! Blueshine-bummer on the UTI. 24 hrs of antibiotics will make a big difference; there are also some OTC products that numb up the urinary tract. May the force be with you during your scan. Feeling well still; maybe a little more tired on this third cycle of Madame X. Feet are hanging in there-a little burning and stinging as I approach the end of the two weeks. Bailing the urea lotion to them. Enjoying poking around the yard on the sunny days and seeing different birds. latest are Baltimore Orioles and little Black and White Warblers.

Saw MO today for routine appmnt and we will try to coordinate the imaging with my IR to see how Y90/Xeloda are treating my liver-not sure when. Got my quarterly Xgeva shot also. Been a little nuts here as my 97 yo FIL has had a sudden onset of seizures. He lives in a veteran's home about 4 hrs from here-so lots of phone consults with his siblings for DH. Frustrating because he lives in a small town and got bounced back and forth between the home and the ER all week before someone finally got a clue. So hard on a very elderly person. Elder care is sadly lacking; burns my bum. A nice weather day here. My container flowers(mostly pansies) are looking so beautiful. Needing to get serious about veggie garden now! Had a nice lunch out with BIL and SIL, who were on their way to see FIL. Managed a cup of a clear Asian veggie soup and half a sandwich, but that is probably it for today. Runor, count me in as one who laughed out loud while reading your post! Micmel- I hope you know that there is no right or wrong decision when it comes to your DD. We do the best we can. There were many times when my daughter was ill or drug addicted that i contemplated having her leave. Each time, i came to the conclusion that if I did that, she would probably not make it. I did everything I could do to save her without enabling. I was naive about a lot in the beginning as the disease of addiction produces champion deceivers. I know that your situation is different, but as a mother, only you can know what your situation requires. The Lynnes-how are you my lovelies? Lynne(Man) love the Bridal Veils-also love green and white gardens and floral arrangements. Lynne(50's)-also happen to love pink and purple gardens, and yours are looking mahvelous dahling! Minnie-saw your comment about DH drinking. Have experience with alcoholism, as do so many of us. One thing I learned at ALANON was not to engage in a conversation with the person when they are intoxicated as usually it leads nowhere. Also that this is a disease which you did not cause and cannot fix. Nobody that ends up abusing alcohol ever set out to have it become a problem; the frontal lobe of the brain is altered and also the liver of alcohol abusers processes alcohol differently. My sister's DH is a high functioning alcoholic. he is a dear man and she has learned to live with him and love him without owning his illness. Magda-relieved as you sound better in your recent post. You are one tough cookie, and I hope your breathing troubles can be eased. Divine- free at last, free at last.......yay for you and DH! and to all of my dear MBC sisters-wishing you peace, solitude, and comfort-LOVE, Mary Jane ",

My DH likes a proper meal each night and even though I love to cook, I don't have the zeal I once had. Some days, my brain is so lame, I can't even think of WHAT to make! I've heard about the hand/foot syndrome with Madame X. I am sure that it will be in my future. Thinking of you as you endure this insult yet again. Micmel, I felt very fatigued on Ibrance, and had a difficult time falling asleep. Less so on Falsodex, but I still have to make myself do things also. i have little talks with myself about how I'll feel better once I tackle this or that chore. My grandson is also very motivating because I am his Mom most of the time and he needs me. My DD is tons better and starting classes on the 22cnd, but still spends a lot of time in her room. She adores him, but sometimes it feels as though she is the big sister. Bighome and Mae-you are rockin it, gals! May you always be out there going after whatever you want! Grannax- I hope the Tamiflu minimizes your symptoms and that you can rest easy. Love to each and may the force be with.....MJH",

Minnie- here's hoping you boldly go to 67 treatments and beyond! Leapfrog-Hi from the Northeastern US! Is that sunflower on your terrace? 50's girl- you have such kind and supportive way. Lynne(Man)-hope chemo recovery is coming along. Such a hard week. I remember it being 12 days before I really felt like eating. Blueshine-how lovely that you could lose yourself in that precious grandchild. Mae-Sounds as though you had a great Sunday! What is the exact nature of your job? Oh man, those \"what ifs\"- they are evil. \"All we have to fear is fear itself\". Grannax-Fun with grandchildren kills cancer cells! Our time spent dreading progression is the absolute pits. When it happened for me, it took me a couple months to accept it, but then I was able to get back to \"normal\". One lesion getting a little bigger is probably OK. Overall it looks like IL is holding things. Definitely ask your MO if you should be switching to Falsodex. Any MO \"worth their salt\" should not be threatened by their patients' looking ahead. You are on the appetizer of the treatment menu. Many targeted therapies are in the pipeline and I think more and more will come available. Micmel-What a handsome Granddog! Relieved that you are on the mend.One morning soon you will wake up and your body will feel totally free of this flipping virus. ( if not, I have the name of a good exorcist) Gracie-The flu is a very bad animal and it's good to take precautions. However, I only had one cold during 16 cycles of Ibrance 125. As a retired lab technologist, best advice is to wash hands, wash hands, wash hands! Use hand sanitizer on grocery cart handles. You can get out! just no rock concerts! Tanya- yay for beets! I grow yummy ones in my veggie garden. I like to make Borsch. I travelled while on Ibrance 125 (2 wks in Ireland). I found being away to be energizing. We did a fair amount of walking, though not as much as in the past. We rented cozy places where we could crash. One day we all stayed in and read books and cooked a proper Irish supper! Sending love and hugs to all of my MBC sisters. May the force be with you. MJH",

I have started the Xeloda and have not experienced any side effects after a few days, so hoping that continues. Ordered the 10% urea lotion to ward off hand/foot syndrome. Spent weekend keeping my grandson busy with sledding, slot car racing, and the first spring bike ride. Always a challenge with this very active boy. Count me in on the pool party! Could use some warm weather and time with women friends! Micmel-I know this is a huge week for you with Friday looming so close. I am with you all the way! In the pocket of that ridiculous hospital johnny(oh wait, they don't have pockets-just huge gaping openings to expose one's nether regions!) Maybe you could get a \"forget pill\" this week until you are under way.... Lynne(50's) so pleased you have had such a peaceful time in Florida. I see you will have to face appmnts and scans upon your return. Good to get them over with and then get on with life again! I know that spring will come to Northern New England someday! Keetmom-sorry to hear that fighting these flipping brain mets is knocking you in the dirt a bit. I think you are doing very well, considering it all. Steroids do seem induce an alternate reality, so getting off of them will feel lots better. You are in my thoughts. Mae-yummy looking meal! I will be thinking of you with the MRI tomorrow-may the force be with you. Bighome-so pleased you had a lovely day out! Sounds wonderful! What a pain in the neck to have to tolerate less than ideal houseguests-such an invasion. Hope things go smoothly with what DH is facing. Thinking of you. Big hugs to all of you-have a peaceful and easy day... Love, MJH P.S. Micmel -LOVE the shoes!",

These millennials are different animals; very very self centered and unable to delay gratification. I do have faith, however, that they will somehow contribute to bettering the world eventually.

With an Oncotype score of 29(19%) recurrence rate, I opted for four TC chemo treatments, giving me a true 30% reduction in risk of recurrence.

My ex-husband was here for the annual work week on his families' hundred year old island cottage. We have an amicable relationship, but my daughter has abandonment issues around him. Anyway, i found myself quite emotional last night driving the 40 miles home from the beautiful harbor town that I grew up in. So many summers waiting tables, sailing, beaching, and at THE very special 100 year old cottage. My ex sister-in-law is still like my sister from a different mother. I felt a tender longing and sense of grief. Not for my ex, but for those crucial developmental years together. We were all working at the same inn where ages ranged from 16-20. We did everything together. I ended up going to the same college as my ex, and we began dating my junior year. We dated for 3 years, and stayed married for only 4 years, but it impacted my life greatly. I think those of us with MBC and other similar diseases may spend a little more time recollecting the past. Anyway, Micmel-that car! Ugh! Glad DSIL to be was not hurt worse.( Like any of us needs more stress) Has there been a change in the wedding plans that I missed?

What an upheaval for you with the remodel, but no doubt, you will LOVE when it's finished! Bighome- I have tolerated Xeloda pretty well. I have not been limited by it much. A couple days second cycle with the stinging feet that caused me to miss my daily walk. I use a lot of sunscreen, too. I also get some blistering on my toes, but they aren't nearly as sore as a blister caused by a chafing hiking boot. oh, and one of my toenails just fell off! Hope you and DH are doing Ok and surviving that hot Florida sun.... I had a little lunch party for my two grands and two neighbor boys to celebrate the last day of school. it was sweet; amazing what you can do with a few dollar store things! I got them grocery store cupcakes and chips to go with that neon orange mac and cheese and they loved it! DH and I have season tickets to an amazing summer music theater. (it is always our Christmas gift to each other) We go to dinner first with 2 other couples. Thursday was our first play and it was over the top. it was \"Million Dollar Quartet\". Set in the 50's about Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Phillips, and Johnny Cash. loved it! Going to see an Elton John tribute concert Tuesday night at a little tiny concert hall. A friend of ours converted an old Grange Hall into a music venue. It has antique wooden chairs with a hodge podge of vintage chair pads. No alcohol, but the most divine homemade desserts for sale at intermission. Usually a very nice evening! Lots going on for me with grandson's activities, camping, folks visiting, gardens, etc. People from Maine try to cram 6 months of activity into 3 months because our summers are so precious and gorgeous! i am feeling great. Still haven't scanned to find out about the Xeloda/Y90. need to talk with my IR and MO. Anyone heard anything from Magda lately? Each and every one of you are in my heart everyday.

Lynne(Man)-Frustrating when communication errors screw up treatment schedules. I was anxious to get started on the Xeloda when the Falsodex failed. It's not a great feeling to feel like things are growing. I did have Cytoxan first time around, with Taxotere. Doses are probably lower with MBC. I think my SE's were similar to what you have experienced during \"hell week\". Methotrexate and Flourouracil are older chemos. Not sure about them, but I think the lower doses might be more tolerable? Thinking of you. Runor-what a painstaking ordeal you have been through with your daughter-glad it is copasetic right now. I never dreamed the things that happened with my daughter could even happen. All bets are off with mother daughter relationships-life gets so messy. It is a wonder that we aren't all mentally crippled. NO1-oh man, what a rough spot you are enduring. It feels awful, but there are so many different phases and emotions with MBC.

I have been a \"lurker\", but have felt every bit of joy, pain and frustration with all of you. Anyway, I'm back. I am intensely concerned for Lita and Dani. Also, don't see DianaRose posting..... I failed Ibrance/letrozole after 15 or 16 cycles. I have recently started Fulvestrant. Too early to know anything. progression is in liver, multiple bone mets are stable. Tumor markers went a little nuts. Radiologist read recent PET scan as mostly stable with a couple shadows that MIGHT indicate liver issues. Well, my MO read the scan himself and absolutely did not agree. He showed me the two bright yellow areas visible in one \"slice\" of the liver, clearly showing progression. He is open to the possibility of putting Ibrance or Abemaciclib back in the mix later, but believes we made the correct decision with the fulvestrant as a monotherapy. I have right lower quadrant discomfort, not awful, but gets my attention. Yeah, I went through the process of feeling one step closer to the grim reaper, and shed more than a few tears, but I'm adjusting with frequent periods of optimism. If one can literally \"live in the moment\", MBC can't touch you. Wish I could achieve that, but some of the time will have to do. My original liver biopsy is currently undergoing genomic testing at Jackson Labs here in Maine. it's free to anyone in Maine. The data will be in an international data base and any new developments in the future will be \"matched\" with any mutations ones' tumor might exhibit. The trial also exists to teach MOs how to interpret the reams of info obtained. My MO is the principal investigator for my clinic. So, know that I love each and every one of you, my amazing MBC sisters! I am in your corner 100%. May the force be with you each and every day!(thanks for the sweet note SP!) Love MJH",

I had the right lobe done May 29th and will be scheduling the MRI to see how it went tomorrow; usually they wait at least 3 months before imaging. I may have something done with the left lobe in the future(depending on imaging) I have also been on Xeloda since March. Something has worked because my symptoms(right side pain) are gone and my tumor markers have gone down significantly. I recommend that anyone with liver mets consult with a good IR.",

Anyway, I'm not sure why your MO doesn't want to use Fulvestrant next. My MO will use the Affinitor/Exemestane after Fulvestrant IF patient gets a long run with the Fulvestrant. If not, he abandons the hormonal treatments and moves to the cytotoxic chemos and/or targeted therapies. Xeloda is an oral cytotoxic med. You haven't progressed, though, correct? Hallelujah for that. Calling F1 sounds like a great resource. The main take away for me from my genomic testing(done at a lab here in the Northeast) was an \"actionable\" mutation\". There were 8 clinical trials suggested. I did not get beyond that, though I did read that there were \"no variants of prognostic relevance identified\". Well, I already know the prognosis here, so what difference would that make! The \"trial\" that I am in that provided the genomic testing involves educating oncologists in reading the reports. it seems that there is a lot of info that is interesting, but not really useful at this point in time. 50's Girl- Stay in Florida! Naples Botanical Gardens sounds heavenly! I LOVE the UK! I get why the Irish and the Scots have major issues with the English; they were brutal. Scotland is magical!

Micmel, sounds as though you are feeling a bit more like a human! Yay! Grannax- how perfect that your Hawaii vacation has meant so much to you and your family! It looks idyllic! Tanya-this is your year for graduations! What a gorgeous family! I had the absolute pleasure of having lunch with the two Lynnes yesterday. Such a nice time with two amazing women traveling this MBC journey with strength and grace. We talked openly and also had some laughs. Such a gift. On my way home,I did treat myself to a little retail therapy in Kittery, Maine, where there are outlets. Two tops for me and loads of OshKosh bargains for the grandkids! I had my Y90 mapping today and it went super well. So many professionals tending to my every need. I was able to have the catheter put in through one of the arteries in my wrist. Other than being sleepy from the happy meds, I feel no side effects whatsoever. Not sure what the next few days will bring. I am gutted at the loss of Kaylynne and Kayborg. No words. Unable to get my head around it. Be with angels, my sweet MBC sisters. Sweet dreams all, have a peaceful night. Love, Mary Jane",

Hope it completely destroys the mets, and that you do not experience future headaches. Grannax-your room looks heavenly! A calming retreat! Praying DD will no longer be plagued with that wretched condition. Also glad that your MO (alias exercise Nazi) kept her mouth shut! Divine- nice to see you here. Your MIL situation- Holy Smokes! Enough already-you have paid your dues.... keetmom-that poor young mother-how difficult. Happy to read that you are enjoying the summer-well deserved Bighome-sounds as though you are keeping your head above water. You and DH have been through so much and here you are caring for him now- what a strong team. Am dizzy from the summer pace- packing for 4 day camping trip to Baxter State park, leaving Thurs. Going with 3 girlfriends and their DH's. always a wonderful time. My grandson will be with us too. Love snuggling and reading to him in our cozy lean-to. Made my famous Blueberry cake to take along. Enjoyed a Portland Seadogs baseball game Friday night with DH and grandson and friends. Boy, was that fun! I enjoyed every bite of my popcorn and hotdog! Gardens are doing nicely-fun to watch them grow. Particularly looking forward to seeing what my pumpkin patch will do. Sending love to all of you, my MBC sisters.

I baked Guinness brownies and Irish Soda bread. I love to bake, but have shut it down due to the diabetes; I did have a tiny taste of each. Anyway, the evening was warm and fuzzy!

I will not know if it worked for a while. Although I could scan now to check on the Xeloda's status, I want to coordinate with my IR to have one scan for both. Feet are now peeling a lot from Madame X, but not too painful, so grateful for that. Went shopping with one of my very good friends yesterday to assist her in choosing a dress for her daughters' rehearsal dinner. Neither of us are into the high fashion scene, but we had a super fun time. The wedding is in July in NYC and will probably be the most formal/fancy wedding I've ever attended. it will be my first experience with any type of \"body shaping\" underthings; could be quite comical! My grandson and i worked in the vegetable garden a little last weekend. He designed and planted a little section of his own; very dear and very fun for Granny! Now if I could just get him to eat what he grows! My cousin and her DH from Baltimore will be with us tomorrow night on their way to Acadia Nat. Park. No one loves coming to Maine more than they do and we usually have Maine seafood and a Maine blueberry pancake breakfast. I am thinking Crab melts on homemade wheat garlic bread with Havarti cheese with bacon crumbles.Also bought a giant eggplant today at Trader Joe's for $1.79. Eggplant parmesan? Small plates of tasty stuff? also some kind of salad. Gracie-sad to think of you not feeling acknowledged. You are equally celebrated here! It is difficult for me to keep up, but everyone is in my thoughts and heart. Lynne(Man) are you through \"hell week?\" Lynne(50's)-the Father's Day BBQ sounds terrific! Hope the scans come out well. Can't hurt to check with rising tumor markers. Just wish we could erase any scanxiety. Are you surviving the cool weather? I have a British \"cooker\" that is on all of the time during the winter. We don't usually shut it down until end of June, and i am sure happy for the warmth of it just now! Micmel- sounds as though you are soldiering on through all of your family drama. Sorry to hear that you may have a cold; hope it's quick. A lake house in Tennessee sounds divine! Mae-you go girl. Get the heck outa there and don't look back.

We all have the same damn labs about every month-they should be able to get it right! Gracie-hope the Abraxane is not beating you up too much.

Morocco sounds so exotic to me! I enjoyed swimming in \"the Med\" while in Spain! Lynne(50's) how the Tamoxifen going? Thinking of you! I am still feeling great on the Xeloda.

He agreed that my scan was pretty much the same as the one in September, however, he felt that since my tumor markers have been rising with some increase in back pain, that had we done a scan in between Sept. and February, it would have been BETTER than either. So he was thinking I may have started to progress a bit. Very happy that all mets are in bone and no return of liver mets. So, my DH and I talked him into another month on Ibrance, then getting another set of tumor markers and going from there.

Often the more common mutations that drive cancers get the most attention as far as drug research. Good to have the info in your back pocket for possible future treatments. Hope the car issue is getting solved the way you want it to. Gracie, My criteria for restarting Ibrance was ANC of 1.0. I stayed on the 125 dose for the whole 16 cycles. A few times I had to wait a week. It does wipe you out, though. I'd be in the midst of cooking something and say to DH, \"I've got to lie down immediately\"- Extreme exhaustion. Tanya-thanks for the info about Molohkia! Lynne(Man)- you have me really wanting some crepes! Thinking of you during your chemo hell week. Love to all my MBC sisters, and may the force be with you.

You are so treasured here, and of course, we want the very best for you. I have just finished my second cycle of Madame X. Feet are beat up, but have not missed a day of walking. Interesting syndrome. Have no indication yet if it's working, but recent pre Y90 MRI of liver shows some central necrosis in the three biggest lesions. Not sure if that would be old or recent? Also revealed multiple small tumors. Still well qualified for May 22 Y90 mapping as far as I know. To all of you dear MBC sisters here in liver mets land, may the force be with you. MJH",

I'm here in your corner wanting the best. Grannax-thank you for sharing the terrific photos. Love the back flip! The silk gown is exquisite. Micmel- Your dress is sooo pretty! Perfect for September! You are going to rock it! 50's Girl-Have a lovely time in Florida! I hate tumor markers. My MO says how one feels is the most important indicator, then scans, then TMs. Mine are beserk right now, i am feeling well. Enjoyed your sweet wedding photos. Getting my blood sugar under control. Taking 45 min. walks with DH every day. Had a pedicure today, which was heaven! Felt a little like a \"normal\" human woman! Hadn't realized how crappy I had been feeling. Having the big PET scan Friday with results on the 8th. Petrified and riddled with scanxiety-we all know the drill.... Once again, I cannot say how much i have enjoyed the photos! Only one of our daughters has been married. I was the \"stepmom of the bride\".Not sure I can locate a photo.

I think it probably would occur eventually anyway as the cancer finds it's way around the hormonal treatments. I had a few liver mets at the initial MBC Dx that were stable on Ibrance for over a year before progressing. Good news for me yesterday as my post Y90 MRI revealed that mets in left and right lobes have been shut down. Since the Y90 was in right lobe, indications are that the Xeloda has been effective in the left lobe. Pretty happy about all of this, but know that the shoe will drop at some point. Until then, I will continue to ride like the wind. You are all in my thoughts and my heart as we wade through the swamps of liver mets land. Mary Jane",

In the lab, say, we may see something on a slide that is caused by the staining procedure and is not a cell or anything organic. We would call that \"artifact\". Sometimes it is difficult to tell the difference, but an experienced eye can distinguish. On an MRI, it might be an area of shadowing that was a result of the test conditions on that particular day, but is not true pathology? Love to you, Mary Jane",
