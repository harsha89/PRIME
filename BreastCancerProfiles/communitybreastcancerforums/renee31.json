I did get my flu shot ( while on chemo) and wore a mask at all times. Patients would freak when I came in with a mask but I would tell them I had a relative at home that had a weakened immune system and I was protecting them. I did'nt feel It was appropriate to tell them I have cancer. I start radiation next week and still plan on working my minimum requirements at night.",
