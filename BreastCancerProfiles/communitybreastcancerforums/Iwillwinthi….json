Not that I was feeling horrible, but sometimes I just wanted to veg and not talk or be positive. It's such a conundrum because on the one hand you are grateful for the support, but on the other you just want to \"be\".

It is so hard not to second guess yourself (even when you got the best possible results!). Who knows? Maybe I would be NED right now with only hormonals? maybe not? All I know for sure is that I wanted/received the most aggressive treatment possible and now I am NED. I am so incredibly grateful.",
