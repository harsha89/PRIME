      "Content": "98765 wrote: I was diagnosed IDC (1.2 cm) on August 13th. All my pains are severely magnified now, but I have had pain in my left hip for a while now, not bad and just a small spot. I am worried it has spread to my hip. This hip is on the opposite side of the breast with cancer. My friend who went through and beat breast cancer several years ago says this is unrelated. I feel great otherwise, except worrying about my breast cancer (emotionally). I feel like I would be really tired and have other symptoms if I was sicker or it had spread. Please give me reassurance! I am SO worried! :( Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "98765 wrote: My mammogram indicated a 1.2cm mass, but my ultrasound indicated a 9 mm mass. Both of these were taken of the same spot. No other abnormalities or calcifications were found on either breast. Which one is accurate? Which one do you claim as the accurate size? I have just been diagnosed and desperately seeking information. Thank you so much!!! :) Log in to post a reply",
