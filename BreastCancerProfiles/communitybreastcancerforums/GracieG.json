It really helped the first treatment with the nausea, the appetite not so much after the nasty taste started and I got the thrush.

I've had a problem with veins too, one blew the last time and they keep working up my arm, and can't go down once they've gone up so I'm just praying they can find 2 more good ones for the final 2 treatments. Robin - I'm so happy you got out today and a fun - what a special day with your friend. I've had a bad day, had my blood work done this morning, it was fine and I have it done except the day of treatment at my PCP's office.  I weighed myself and I had gained 9 lbs. in one week. I came home and call the onc's office.  His nurse called me and told me it was a SE from the Taxotere. Now, this surprises me as I'm 14 days out from my 2nd treatment & this is just showing up?  I literally cannot see my ankle bones.  She told me to weigh myself Monday and call if it's higher.  She told me the onc does not like to prescribe a diuretic and I remember this after my hospital stay with my BMX.  They had a problem with my low blood pressure for a couple of days and loaded me up on fluids.  I had to stay an extra couple of days until they finally got this under control, but I looked like the Michelin Man for days after I got home and my BS would not prescribe anything either because of the problems with my blood pressure.  So , I'm bald, fat and emotional.  Not my best day. Hoping I shed the water retention soon.  I'm living in my strechy pants! Have a good evening all! ",

He said the fatigue will take about 6-8 weeks before it leaves, it appears to be one of the last SE's to leave the body.  No weekly blood work next week, but I see him again in 3 weeks and we will discuss starting the hormone therapy drug at that meeting.   I will also be calling my PS next week to set up an appointment to discuss when I can have my exchange surgery, I'm so ready to get these TE's out.  He said he could do the surgery as soon as my WBC was back to normal.  My boys came up and surprised me during my last treatment.  I came home and took a nice long nap, I was so tired from being up from the steroids last night,  Just 3 more oral doses and I am done!  Probably another restless night tonight, but I don't care, I've crossed the finish line and I can't tell you how amazing that feels.  I can even handle the inevitable SE's that I know are coming.   Everyone have a great night! ",

Lisa - I'm so sorry about your hot flashes as well that returned with the Tamox.  I'll be starting Arimidex soon and I hear that's a SE for that drug as well. Annie - I was happy to hear your Mom is doing better.  Is the steroid cream helping with the puffiness under your eyes? Robin - I hear you on the hair.  Of the few strays I've seen the white is winning too.  My decision to have a BMX was pretty easy.  I had 2 tumors in my left breast about 2\" apart and a lumpectomy wouldn't have left me with much breast as I wasn't that big to begin with.  Plus my Mom died from BC many years ago.  Hers started in her left breast, then 2 years later moved into her right breast.  I always told myself if I was ever diagnosed with BC I would have a BMX.  I'm very happy with my decision, especially with my high Onchotype score.  I'm so impressed with your weight loss.  I don't eat a lot of sweets, my favorites are salty foods, which are not helping with the water retention. ckk - I'm so sorry that things like walks and running errands are taking their toll on you - but I'm in the same boat.  Even the smallest exertion puts me down.   I can't believe the huffing and puffing noises coming out of my mouth.  This must get better for us soon, I just know it. Good luck with the BMRI test on Monday. Wave - It sounds like you and ckk and I are all going through the same things as far as being so tired and winded.  It has to get better soon.  I had a manicure yesterday and hope you enjoyed your pedicure. Karmil - Sounds like great news about the Tamox for 2 1/2 years and then switching to the AI.  I'm so happy you have your date set for your TE exchange.  I see my PS next week and can't wait to set the date for mine. Bailey - I'm so happy for you that JD is fitting right in with the family.  I do hope your blood counts are back to normal soon.  Enjoy your daffodils, I've seen a few blooming here too, what a crazy winter. I saw my breast surgeon Thursday, she wanted to see me when I was done with chemo.  She hadn't seen me since my TE's had their final fill and gave the thumbs up on them!  She checked my skin and said I have a very low chance of recurrence on the skin, but she would like to see me once a year to check it. I saw my MO yesterday for my 3 weeks PFC visit.  My blood work was all good.  He wrote me my RX for Arimidex, but told me to go ahead and wait 2 weeks to start it, he wants my body to finish healing from the chemo.  He said the most common SE from it was bone and joint pain to the small joints, like the fingers, wrists etc.  He said it was worse if your cholesterol is high and mine has always been borderline high.  He sent the orders to my PCP to have my cholesterol checked.  We've been managing it with supplements, but I'm afraid I'll start have to take an RX for the cholesterol as well.  I always knew it was just a matter of time before I would have to do that. I've also heard the Arimidex also causes hot flashes, which is just wonderful since I've already been through that with menopause.  I've read here that a low dose RX of Effexor can help with that.  I think it's an anti-depressant, might not hurt me to take that as well!  I see my MO again in 3 months. I've tried walking outside on my own, but I'm not being very consistent with it. My DH did go for a 30 minute walk with me today.  I need to lose about 10-15 pounds.  Some of it may still be water retention, but I have a feeling most of it is inactivity.  I've decided to join my ladies only gym again.  I did very well losing weight when I went there before and since I'm paying for it, it motivates me to go more!  I'm going the first of next week to sign back up.   I see my PS next Wednesday, and hopefully we can get the date set for my exchange surgery.  I will be so happy to get rid of these TE's! Have a great weekend everyone! ",

I had the same problem with the vein from my second treatment. They gave me some Emu oil to use on it, but it is still a little red & peeling like yours. She said after she blew the first vein last time, she had to go deep into a smaller vein & that's what caused the problem. She was able to find a good vein yesterday & all I have is some small minor bruising, so should have no problems with this one, then just me more to go! Whoot!",

I took the Claritin, but it didn't help much this time.  I ran a low grade fever Monday and Tuesday nights, It never got higher than 100.1, but it was just high enough to make me achy and tired.  I've hardly been off the couch or the bed.  But I did turn the corner today, the fever broke and the bone & nerve pain is much better.  One more treatment, I CAN do this. Madison, Robin, Lisa and Annie - I am so proud and happy for all of you that you have completed your treatments.  What a milestone for you all and hoping all went well with your final treatments.   ckk - I have gained water weight retention as well.  My onc finally put me on a diuretic and potassium pills that I take 3xd a week, they are really working & I've only taken 2 so far. I'll know more when I get my blood work done this Friday and get weighed.  Nothing but good thoughts for you for your upcoming treatment this Friday.  I have shared very little about my BC experience on my FB account.  I'm so picky about who I pick foir friends, I got so tired of friends of high school friends filling up my friends requests and I don't even remember these people.  I have sent you a PM about joining the private FB account just for us BC sisters! Madison - Thank you so much for sharing your story of your emotions during your last treatment and the strength you have found.  Both you and Robin have made it sound like a celebration of sorts - and it is, you're done!

Rachel - I'll be waiting for a new picture with the new wig, I bet it looks adorable! Hoping all my strong BC friends are doing well and having a peaceful evening!  I don't know what I'd do without all you strong women here. ",

My taste buds have just the opposite effect on sweet foods, I prefer salty because it seems like I can taste the food better.  Weird thing about this #3 treatment, my taste buds were back almost immediately. I can only take this change in my entire lifestyle as far as products I use and food I eat and what cookwear I use one step at a time.  It's too much to take on all at once,. I have an SIL who is an 8 year breast cancer survivor, she is crazy.  She is constantly sending me emails and texting and calling me about what I need to change to change in my life.  Last nights email was about how lemon can treat you better than chemo can.  I just reply and thank her for the information.  But sometimes the hubs listens to her, that worries me!  I should ask her about all that's been discussed here, but I won't, she knows everything!   That's sounds mean, but I don't have room for crazy in my life right now. ",

I've had some water retention with the Taxotere, but I'll deal with that weight gain after chemo, some cardio will do wonders for that.  Thinking positive here!!  Started my last oral dose of steroids today, my final chemo is tomorrow.  My Grandson was out of school today & stayed with us for the day.  I didn't know who to feel more sorry for, me for having the jitters, or him, he's almost 6 for having to witness Grandma today!  I think I felt more sorry for him!   So, here's to a sleepless night and a final chemo treatment!   I'm calling the PS next week for an appointment to talk about when I can have the exchange surgery, I am so ready to get these TE's out of me, get the final surgery done, and try to get back a somewhat normal life, if we can ever have that again.  Being post menopausal I will be taking Arimidex for 5 years and have intentionally not read about those side effects yet, I just wanted to get through chemo first before I started to research this.  One thing at a time, right!   It sounds like most of you have had a few SE's that lasted longer after your last treatment.  I can live with that as long as I know it's the last time I will have them.   Have a great night everyone!  I'll be thinking of you as I'm NOT sleeping tonight!! ",

We are all almost there. Lisa, I'm so sorry that with your regular work schedule now after chemo is over and not sleeping well at nights is taking it's toll on you. I have just rolled with the SE's this time, knowing it's the last time for them. Of course I am so fortunate that I'm not working or have children still at home that I can sweat, toss & turn all night and sleep the morning away. I did have to run a couple of errands today, and found myself so out of breath & doing the 80 yr. old shuffle that getting my stamina back is high on my list. I ran a little low grade fever last night, & I'm sure a little one this evening. nothing over 100. The strangest thing is that I am 5 days post treatment & had the worst bone pain today in both my legs. I usually get it a few dys after my Neulasta shot, but this seems to be the longest it has lasted. It always affects the long bones in my legs, from the thigh to the knee & from the knee to the ankle. I had to take a pain pill this evening & I never do that. So, maybe the 4th treatment is the one that just keeps on giving a little longer. I think it would be an absolute hoot if we all were able to get together & talk about our chemo brain, funny thing is that we would probably have no problems understanding each other! Have a good night all you wonderful women!",

Madison, My thoughts have been with you all day and am hoping everything went just fine. Momof3, I felt exactly the same way you did when everyone said before the 4th, yay, it's over.  I didn't even bother to tell them it was only the treatment was over, not the SE's. I'm still in that waiting to get far enough past the last treatment, 10 days out, to get some of my energy back.  The 4th one really knocked me on my butt and I'm still waiting to feel better.  Still have some flu like feelings, low energy levels, water retention & I've developed a purple bruise like looking lower spot on my big toe of my left foot that is very painful.  All of my fingernails have been hurting, but not as much as the toe and they're not discolored. I also have some redness and sore skin that runs down my index fingers and around down up through the thumbs.  These are SE's I've never had before and while not one of them on it's own is that bad all of them put together are bothersome.  Being only 10 days done, I'm not all that worried and am hoping that with a little more time they will quickly resolve.  I'm so anxious to get my post \"normal\" chemo life back.  I am listening to my body and still taking it easy.  I know it won't be last long and things will be as right as rain!  Until later, everyone.   ",

Wave - I'm so sorry for your long day at your simulation today.  The way you described it, it sounded a little like a game of Twister.  So happy for you that you will have less treatments and got the time slot you wanted, it is the silver lining!  Let's just say your wearing the green today was a simulation for tomorrow! I took my walks today and my muscle pain seems to be letting up a little - I will keep going and hope it keeps getting better.  Other than that and doing laundry, had a nice easy day today.

Karmil - So sorry about your poor DH's being hit with the stomach bug again, poor guy.  Also sorry about your laptop, hope it can be fixed.  I'm with you on sleeping attire, I also sleep in a cotton T shirt, nothing on my legs though.  The covers are busy all night being tossed around.  My PS's office went through my vitamins and supplements and told me what I had to stop taking before surgery, but it wasn't all of them.   Wave - Good for you for getting back to the gym today.  How do you feel after your first visit back yesterday? Momof3 - I'm hoping your WBC is back up too.   Great news about your exercising.   Rachel - I hope the pledge drive is going well and you're getting lots of pledges for lots of money!  I'm watching my Grandson Friday, he's been off all week for Spring Break and wants a day with Grandma, so I'm resting up for that day!  He's almost 6, on April 4th.  It's been terrible weather here all week for spring break.  Cloudy, cool and rainy, so I'm hoping he's not too hyper from being inside all week!  Maybe I should have kept him on Monday!  One thing I know for sure is that I will be tired after my son picks him up after he gets off work, but it's worth it. Have a great day ladies! ",

      "Content": "Mar 30, 2012 04:38AM - edited Mar 30, 2012 04:41AM by GracieG LeesaAnn - I'm so sorry you have had such a disappointing time with your PA & then your MO. It certainly sounds like none of your questions about follow up care that we should assume would be a part of our after care are not being addressed. I fully understand the level of fear and anger you must be feeling. Maybe take them up on their offer to see their own therapist & tell them about how you feel about not receiving the follow up care you feel you should from their office. I see my own MO in another 2 months & will have blood work done a week before I see him, after that appointment I have no idea what my schedule will be with him. I will start taking Arimidex in a few days & I really don't know if there is testing that can be done for that drug to test to see if it is working effectively. Momof3 - You seem to have an excellent plan with your MO for future visits. Your Aunt sounds like she was a wonderful person. So sorry she had a recurrence. That is my biggest fear. My Mom lived for 10 years after she was diagnosed before she passed from BC after a recurrence. Karmil - I am so sorry my post about my exchange surgery sent you running to the phone. Each PS does their own thing. Some even use drains after an exchange surgery, thank goodness we didn't have to go through that! I had a Lat Flap done at the time of my BMX, & at that time my PS made my areolas & nipples, so I had those already after my first surgery. That is where my scars were, where he made the areolas from the skin on my back when he cut the muscles from there. Of course, I also have the scars on my back from the Lat Flap. I did suffer tissue death mostly on my left side, the cancer side & had to have outpatient surgery 2 weeks after my BMX to have the dead tissue debrided. Unfortunately I lost the left nipple during that procedure. Ever since then, I have gone back & forth on whether I wanted the PS to make me another nipple for the left side. In the end, I decided to have him remove the right nipple during my exchange surgery & he made both areolas look much better during this surgery. I am happy with my decision & can have my areolas tattooed as soon as I'm healed or ready. I'm sure that's why I'm in a compression bra. All the work he did during the exchange surgery was through these areolas & they are healing with steri strips & dressings that the bra keeps in place. I want the option to go braless if I want to & not have 2 nipples that are erect all the time. as far as the leg compression cuffs, that was what the surgery centers standard of after care is & had nothing to do with my PS. They are a pain in the butt & I'm not sleeping all that well because of them. Only 5 more nights & I am done with those. Rachel - I am so sorry your final treatment day went so darn badly for you. It's not fair. I had the same reaction you did to the Taxetore, but at my very first treatment. They stopped the drip, called my MO, jammed me in the leg with an epinephrine pen & had an oxygen mask & blood oxygen monitor on me. After 30 minutes they started the drip back slowly, like yours & increased it every 15 minutes. After that, they did all the remaining treatments with the Taxotere that way, extra steriods, a hit off an inhaler and a drip that they increased the flow of. I never had another bad reaction, and you don't have to worry about, because you are done! I hope you are getting some well deserved rest right now after your long day you had. So happy you are done! I had a \"sleepy\" day today & now am up way too late! Hoping you're all having a peaceful nights sleep!",

Whata - I hope you're feeling a little better today.  I can relate somewhat.  I went to visit my Granddaughter yesterday (she's almost 3) and it's been so long since I've been able to run around and play with her like I used to, she doesn't even ask me to play with her anymore.  It just breaks my heart.  I can't wait to get off this chemo ride and get back to normal. For everyone with dry skin that has changed during chemo, I called my sister in Denver who has a friend who is a dermatologist and her friend recommended (both by Cetaphil) Restoraderm Body Wash to wash my face and Restoraderm skin restoring moisturizer which have both really helped with the dry skin.  And the kicker, she told me to use Ponds Cold Cream at night as a face cleanser.  She said not to use water to wash it off, but to use 100% cotton squares to clean it off, then use the Restoraderm moisturizer after that on my face and neck.  My skin is so soft I can't believe it.  My eyes and nose will not stop running.  My onc says the runny eyes is from the Taxetore and the runny nose is from the Cytoxin.  I've been though more boxes of tissues than I can count!  I've lost a little of the water retention I had this last weekend.  I can start to see my ankle bones again, so yay!  My 3rd TX is Friday, this is supposed to be my good week, but with the water retention and my emotional status I haven't been able to enjoy it.  And if one more person tells me that I'm half way done I may have to hurt them.

      "Content": "Dec 30, 2011 03:59PM GracieG wrote: Hello all, I have been reading this thread closely as I had my first of 4 TC's on Dec. 16th.  My Oncotype score was 30 so there was really no question about my getting chemo.  That score comes with a 20% chance of recurrence and the chemo with 5 years of Arimidex after chemo reduces my recurrence to 10%.  At my first treatment I had an reaction to the Taxotere with severe back pain and shortness of breath.  The nurses were all over it with oxygen, blood pressure monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, a shot of epinephrine and 2 hits on an inhaler.  They called my onc who told them to stop the drip for 30 minutes and then start again at a lower drip and increase it every 15 minutes.  Luckily I got through the rest of it just fine.  After weeks of anxiety about starting the chemo I slept the entire night through that night.   I had long hair down to the middle of my back.  I decided to get it cut short about 4 weeks ago and donate it to locks of love plus I wanted everyone to get used to seeing me without the long hair before chemo.  Last week I had it shaved, but it is at this time only thinning which is surprising to me at 14 days.  I went to our local American Cancer Society and was given a free wig, hat and scarf.  The wig I chose was almost identical to my hair color and when my hairdresser shaved my head she trimmed and styled it.  The only problem is that my head is like a little steam engine!  I can't stand to wear anything on it for long because of the hot flashes.  I am such a cold blooded person that this was very surprising to me, that my head was hot all the time.  I had placed a big order for hats and scarves with TLC, but am only keeping the 2 knit hats I ordered and am returning the rest.  The best thing I've found for me when I go out is baseball caps. So, I just ordered a few of those for small heads.  On really cold days I'll wear the knit hats when I go out. At home I've been wearing a soft cotton jersey knit turban that I can take off and on as my head heats up. I have the neulasta shot the day after each treatment and my onc is the one who told me about taking Claritin. I took one the day before, the morning of and a few days after treatment, and the pain was minimal and managed well by Tylenol.  By the 3rd night I was suffering from low grade fevers that lasted 2 days, but were never high enough to warrant a call to the Dr.  I thought those were the worst days until I too developed thrush.  My onc put me on an anit-fungal med that took a few days to work.  Between the pain of that and the nasty taste in my mouth I lived on protein shakes that my hubby got very good at making. I had been rinsing 4 times a day with baking soda/salt water and my onc recommended a mouth rinse called reBalance that is specifically formulated for cancer patients.  Only one pharmacy in my area carried it, but I stopped Wednesday and got a bottle.  I had my blood work done last Friday and my WBC was low so I was started on antibiotics as a precaution against infections.  I had more blood work done today and am waiting on the results.  I was a very active person before my surgery, but have not had any energy to even go for a short walk.  The fatigue has taken over my life and the insomnia at night is not helping.  My onc gave me an RX for Atavin and I don't don't why I am resisting taking it, but I am so tired today I will take one tonight.   Thank you all for posting about your experiences here, I have learned a lot from reading and look forward to posting more often. Treatment #2 is next Friday for me. ",

I also stay out of the threads that tend to be less positive - we have so many choices here, it's easy to find the ones you're comfortable reading. BJMRN - I thought about you today as I was getting my treatment and hope yours went well.  ckk - Great post about recurrence fears, I don't think we would be normal if we didn't think about them, just don't dwell on them. Wave - Beautiful poem, you have a wonderful way with words. momof3boya - Your fears and scary thoughts are perfectly normal.  I had a yeast infection before I started Chemo and was convinced the cancer had spread.  My BC surgeon and I had a good laugh about it when I told her.  She said this will pass with time. I get my blood work checked every Friday, it's just something my onc does. Going back in the morning for my Neulasta shot.  I could never give it to myself and was never even offered that option. Rachel - My thoughts on headwear is to do whatever is comfortable and best for yourself.  I have a wig, ordered several scarves and hats.  I have discovered that even though I am cold blooded my head is a little steam engine,  I don't wear the wig, returned the hats and scarves and ordered 5 spiffy new ballcaps that I wear when I go out.  At home I'm commando or if my head does get chilly I wear a cotton knit jersey turban that one of our local cancer support groups gave me.  I've only had one woman ask me if I had cancer when I was wearing my ballcap and I told her yes, I had breast cancer and reminded her that 1 in 8 woman will be diagnosed with it and reminded her to get her yearly mammogram and do her self exams.  So, I will use this as a reminder to women  and a teaching tool for anyone who asks.  My little bit of thinning stubble continues to hang on, I'm sure it won't be around long since I've had the second treatment.  I'm so okay with this. I'm tired of finding the little stubble hairs around the house. Have a good night everyone.   ",

My blood work today was good, so I can leave the house without feeling like I am going to catch every germ that is floating around out there.  I got a manicure today, so nice to feel semi-normal again.  My cuticles have been super dry, never have been before, so I went and bought some Burt's Bees cuticle cream to help with that.   I've had the worst time with the runny nose problem - the chemo nurses said it was a common SE of the Cytoxin and to always keep tissues with me as you never know when it will start to run.

Good God, now I have to wash the clothes I hate to wear. Hubby & I went to a college basketball game tonight we have season tickets too, but with 10 minutes left in the game the fatigue just washed over me & I thought I was going to cry, so we left. When did I become this emotional wreak of a woman. Can I possibly make it through 2 more treatments? Of course I can, but it is getting tough. Treatment #3 this Friday. Did someone here say #3 is a tough one? Should I just plan my 3 weeks of isolation in my room now, or is somebody going to say something positive, like #3 was so much better than 1 & 2.

I am one week past #3 treatment, so besides the ever present fatigue I should have a couple of fairly good weeks before my last treatment (I've never typed that before, it felt good)! No super parties for me either. I have no appitite & may just order a pizza for a change, or have the hubs go pick one up, no idea what delivery time is like for a pizza on Super Bowl Sunday. Thanks to all who answered my questions on the parabens. Not a single one of my Dr.'s has even discussed this with me, so who do I let have it? My BS is the one who gave me the news about being ER & PR + so do I take it out on her or my onc? Since I seem to be the only one with no knowledge of this from any medical professional I will leave it up to my fellow BC sisters to keep me in the loop. My sensitive skin issues do have me worried though. I tried a new deodorant once & ended up at the dematologist's office. Same with a new blush. Everything for laundry, etc. is bought with fragrance & dye free. The weekend is usually quiet here so everyone have a good one!",

I have been doing about 20 minutes of extremely light cardio, where my body used to be able to handle much more than this. I just listen to my body, & when it tells me I'm tired, I'm done for the day. I've been riding the Jammie couch all day as the bone & joint pain hit today from the Neulasta shot. Besides taking a shower, I've done nothing all day, & the fatigue has been overwhelming after this treatment. Knowing this is the last time for all of the SE's has helped a little.

Wave - I'm happy you got your redness from your IV checked out not only by your derm, but also by your MO's nurse.  I honestly don't know what to say about your derm's remark about your looking older from the chemo - maybe she was joking, I hope! Deb- That information about Taxotere perhaps being contaminated is too frightening to even think about, I had a bad reaction to my first treatment with it.  Wonder if I should ask my MO about it. Have a great night everyone! ",

Rachel - I'm sorry you had a crappy Sunday, but was relieved to read that today is a little better for you. BTW, popcorn has been one of my biggest cravings, I've eaten more in the past 3 months than in my entire life I think, and am still eating it! ckk - I was thinking about you and your test today, sounds like it was a might uncomfortable, they don't make anything easy for us, do they?  I hope by now you've had the call with good news from your MO.  I'm right there with you on the weight.  At first I needed to lose 10, now it's 15 & I would even be happier with 20 at this point.  Slow and steady, we'll get there. Robin - Glad to hear your first rad treatment went well and you were happy with the mapping, Great job sticking with that treadmill. I took 2 walks today.  The weather was absolutely heaven here today, in the 70's and not windy, I live in Kansas and that is nearly impossible to have the temperature warm up without the wind blowing like crazy.  I took a long walk around my neighborhood, came home, hydrated and headed out again.  My thighs and calves are killing me, but it felt so good to get out in the great weather and just move.  The added bonus of no wind allowed my ball cap to stay on!!   It's supposed to be this nice all week, so my get back into shape and lose the chemo weight plan is officially in motion.  I'm going to re-join my ladies only gym after my exchange surgery.  Can't wait to see the PS this Wednesday!   Have a wonderful evening all. ",

I forgot how much puppies love to chew! Joyce - It sounds like you had a great weekend with your boys. Sorry you have to wait to start your rads, but you certainly don't want to start until your WBC counts are back to normal. Where my drains were is still a little tender, not too painful, but I haven't worn a bra a all with my TE's. Rachel - I was happy to read you're feeling a little better. I'm so sorry your nephew has has such a bad winter & you've not been able to see him, that must be tough on you. Annie - Congrats on the new car! My DH have been going back and forth forever on whether or not to get one. ckk - What a busy weekend you had! Besides the chaperone duties you added prom dress shopping and a 5 mile hike - I'm exhausted just reading about it! Whoops about your appointment time today, I'm happy they could still get you in. Wave - I'm happy your husband got away as a reward for taking such good care of you. Yikes about the groceries! Are there any teenage boys that live nearby that could help with the groceries for a few bucks? That is too bad about your rads appointment, did you ever make it in? Karmil - Your support meeting sounded really interesting. Good for your sister for wanting to talk to your breast surgeon. I have not joined any support groups or gone to therapy. I just haven't felt the need for myself. I welcome the tears when I have them - I think it's still a part of the healing process. Lisa - I hope you enjoyed your walk. We had all our wonderful weather last week and I took a walk every day, but today woke up to thunder & heavy rain, so stayed indoors. Heather - I'm so sorry you're having the skin problems with the rads. Surely there is something else available for you to try to get some relief. I finally gave into the leg pain after all the walks last week & just became a couch potato this weekend. I listened to my body & it was telling me to give it a rest. I was going to start walking again today, but woke to thunder and heavy rain so stayed indoors again. I am going to try again tomorrow as taking a couple of days off has really helped with the leg pain. No rain in the forecast, so fingers crossed for decent weather, although we really needed the rain.",

The weatherman is in deep doo doo with me today, as I was ready to go walking again and woke up to more rain, minus the thunder today.  We do need the rain, but I am starting to miss my walks now.  I'm going to re-join my gym, but was waiting until after my exchange surgery next week as my PS said no exercise for 2 weeks after to prevent bleeding, he wants my heartbeat as a resting rate for 2 weeks, it sounds a little extreme to me, but I will follow his instructions.",

I decided on a BMX because my Mother died of BC & I had always told myself if I was ever diagnosed with BC that is what I would do to be as pro-active as I could. They removed 3 nodes during surgery and like you I had no node involvement. So I think, this is the best news, Stage I with no node involvement. When I saw my Breast Surgeon for my follow up visit, she told me that she was ordering the Onchotype DX test for me. She said that as little as 5 years ago women like you & I with our small tumor size & no node involvement wouldn't even have been offered chemo and then if there was ever a recurrence the Dr.s would wonder why, with our initial pathology. My Onchotype score came back with a score of 30. It is scored from 1-100. My score is considered somewhat high, but I've seen women here with much higher scores. The test breaks down slides of your tumor & tests it for 21 different genes & tells you what your percentage rate is for recurrence. My score meant my little tumors were more aggressive than they thought and both my BS & my MO said I would benefit greatly from chemo & Arimidex, since I am ER+. I had a 20% chance of recurrence without chemo, with chemo it took it down to a 10% chance. I'll take a 90% survival rate any day! I had 4 rounds of Taxetore and Cytoxin given every 3 weeks. I would ask your Dr.s if this test is available to you, to help you make the best decision. All the best - Gracie",

Your insights and tips have been an inspiration to me and I thank you all, especially for the warm welcomes.  We are all fighting like hell to beat and win this fight, and we will! ",

My stubble continues to fade away, in fact I wish it would just all go now and leave me without all the bald patches, yuk. LeesaAnn - Will be thinking of you tomorrow as you go through your 3rd and hoping you can get some sleep tonight in spite of those dreaded steriods. BTW: Does anyone else use eye drops from their onc for days 2-4 post Taxotere? I keep forgetting to ask about this. Hoping everyone has a restful night. ~ Gracie ~",

Heather - I'm so excited for you and your upcoming adoption of the greyhound, we had a miniature greyhound that passed away after 14 years of giving us much love and happiness.  Am so sorry about your strep throat, it just isn't fair, this is supposed to be your good week, jeez. My body feels so fatigued today I can hardly sit up for long periods of time.  Just a all over heavieness and it feels like I might be starting to run a low grade fever, so going to rest for now. ",

HeatherW - Your Dad is an amazing man with his donation for you for the Koman walk, Congratulations to you.  I am not a tattoo person, but would love to see the design you come up with. ckk - Sounds like you've pulled through your bad time and are feeling somewhat better. Yay for girls night out, hope you were able to have a blast!  I'm so glad the cold caps worked so well for you and HeatherB, they were a little out of my price range unfortunately!  Kathy - What a an uplifting post by you - that's what makes it such a pleasure to come here and read what everyone's experiences are, good or bad. Rachel - I was with Wave and was worried you were napping in your car, so glad to hear your Mom was driving.  I do hope you are finally getting some good rest, especially after putting in your hours at work. HeatherB - I told my onc today that the Ativan was not helping me sleep and I was waking up every hour during the night. He admitted it was more for anxiety and prescribed me Restoril 30mg when I told him the lack of sleep was really contributing to my fatigue issues.  It sounds like you and Nitro are really bonding, that has to be helping your state of mind right now. Annie - I've been lucky, the one SE I haven't had is neuropathy in my hands or feet,  I really thought about your story of of the receptionist who had BC.  It does make you think of the 1 out of 8 women that will be diagnosed with it. Bailey - I love the idea too of the NED t-shirt and would love to see what ideas everyone comes up with.  So sorry about your neuropathy as well, hope it clears up again. Lisa and Madison - I am so excited for you both for your last treatments coming up next week!  What a milestone!  I totally agree Lisa that people just look at the number of treatments left and not the time it takes after the treatments, even if it's the last one for the SE's for to subside. Today was treatment #3 for me.  My blood work was all good except my hemoglobin was low and the my onc thought this might be contributing to my ongoing fatigue.  He did admit when I told him I just was not sleeping well, waking up every hour that the Ativan was more for anxiety than to help with sleep, so he prescribed Restoril 30mg.  I also gained 9 lbs, when I had my blood checked last week.  When I called the onc's office the nurse told me that retaining fluid was a common SE of the Taxotere.  I asked didn't she think it was a little unusual for it to show up 14 days after my second treatment.  She said they would check my weight today and see where it was.  After a week of being bloated and having  no ankle bones my weight had not gone down today.  My onc prescribed an RX for a diuretic and Potassium but told me just to take them 3x a week because I have low pressure.  The week my weight went up I had started doing some very light cardio, just 10 minutes on the exercise bike and 10 minutes on the treadmill at very low speeds.  I asked him if this could have had anything to do with the water retention and he said no and to continue with it when I was feeling up to it,.  So, I started my steroids of 2 doses yesterday and got no sleep last night.  Was up super early to head to the oncs for blood work, seeing him and then heading to chemo.  He decided to UP my steroids at treatment since I had that reaction to the Taxortere during my first treatment, you can imagine my delight at this.  Again they started the drip at 50 and moved it up by 50 every 15 minutes until it got to 250, It does take longer, but I had no reaction so was worth it.  Then the Cytoxan took an hour and I was out of there.  The good news today is that the nurse found a good vein on the first time.  Well, time for my night time dose of my steroid so another sleepless night for me, so I will be the first one there tomorrow for my Neulasta shot. It is such a joy to come here and read all my fellow BC sisters posts and stories, I look forward to everyone of them. Gentle hugs and restful nights to all.     Gracie ",

Robin, I am so happy to hear your foot is looking better and hope it continues to improve. Heather, Glad you and Nitro got some sleep last night, sorry he had to wake you up to get his sleep. I am really hoping your SE's are minimal for this final time. It sounds like a lot of us are having a tough time with the hot flashes. I guess it's a good thing it's winter and am really hoping they get better after chemo is over.  Someone who has finished up treatment needs to report in and let us know if they get better.   ",

Heather, so sorry you are still feeling poorly and had to make a trip to the ER, hope the antibiotics will help soon. We are getting the first measurable snow of the winter here, & we're only going to get 1-2 inches. I hate winter and the cold, but even I have to admit it's kind of nice to see some of the white stuff! It will be in the 40's on Tuesday so it will be gone. My husband & I have started talking about where we would like to move, or find somewhere to spend the winters. My Dad & his wife winter way down in south Texas in the Rio Grande Valley & it is very nice there. They really do cater to the \"Winter Texans\". I would hate to leave the Grandkids, but they could miss us for the winter! Anyway, this is probably years away. I am really starting to ramble! Good night all!",

Rachel, I hope you got to take your walk today.  Sorry about the squirrels invading your bird feeders, we had to stop filling ours for that reason, and the hawks being attracted to the bird activity, didn't care for that, but I do miss my feeders. Heather, I was glad to hear your rad tattoos look like freckles, that doesn't too bad.  Of course you may think different. Hope you had a great date night tonight, it sounds like so much fun.  We've only been out a few times since my surgery to eat, and before chemo I made a list of all my favorite places to go out to, not knowing how the chemo would affect my appetite and not knowing if the nausea would be bad.  I'm happy to report we made it to every place on the list,  I'm going to start on a new list so we can start going out again. Karen, your chemo brain movie story gave me a little laugh, no one will let me pick out anything to go do or do anything remotely like picking out a time or a theater.  Glad you liked the movie, the previews actually looked pretty good.  My personal experience with chemo brain is that it is much more pronounced right after chemo.  For the first few days I cannot remember words and stumble trying to get them out of my brain and coming out my mouth correctly.  It doesn't always work and there are lots of pauses while I try to get the words out, but it seems to get better as time goes by between treatments, hoping it's one SE that won't stick around too badly. Hope everyone is having a good weekend and is feeling okay.. ",

We all know it's not the end of the SE's, but the final time to suffer through those as well. Robin - I'm with you, can't believe it's almost March. Thank God this chemo filled winter is almost over! I do keep my feet elevated, but even if I just sit up for an hour or 2 I have to lie down & elevate again because of the swelling - so annoying. So happy you got to go to the Look Good Feel Better class. I really liked all the products I got at my class. I love the Fight Like a Girl slogan &love the panties story!

I have not heard of the SE of the fluid retention under the eyes, mine is all inmy lower legs, ankles and feet. Hope you can get some answers for that. Rachel - Tour continued stamina amazes & inspires me. It sounds like you are showing your friends a wonderful time during their visit (I'm hoping your friend has been able to join his GF by now) . I do hope your thrush is over & done with. I still have that purple discoloration on just one of my big toes. It is still very painful & I can't wear shoes for a long period of time without it really hurting. I find it very odd it's just one toenail & am hoping I don't lose it. For now it's just discolored & painful. Bailey - I was so happy to read that you're feeling so much better this week, good news!",

It sounds like besides a few SE's, we are starting to find our post chemo normal. I'm not doing rads because I had the BMX, but my cousins wife will be starting soon, her lumpectomy was in January, so I'm anxious to hear how those of you having rads will be faring. I'm still overwhelmed with an unending fatigue that I can't wait to get rid of. It's really preventing me from getting back to a more normal life at this point. My son brought my Granddaughter over on Saturday & they had all been sick for about a week. He assured me they were all doing better, but my DH & I have both not felt very good the past couple of days, so I'm thinking we caught a little of their bug & that may account for my slowing down pace I've had. Hopefully it won't last long. I see my BS on Thursday, probably for the last time, she wanted to see me after I was done with chemo. Then I see my onc on Friday, will get the results of my blood work from last Friday, & probably my RX for the Arimidex. I am wondering what my follow up schedule will be with him from now on.

Erica - It's nice to have your feeling validated by your PA.  I myself have had the different feelings since I've been done with chemo.  It's good to know it's part of of the normal cycle we go through, ckk - I'm right there with you on not sleeping well.  I'm awake at least every hour or so & never feel fully rested which is probably why my fatigue is lasting longer than I think it should.  A lot of mine has to do with hot flashes also. Wave - Sounds like we're in the same boat as ckk with our sleep patterns.  I've taken a few Ativan here and there, but even that doesn't help me sleep through the night.  I didn't know you were anemic.  Surely there is something your MO can give you for that - iron? Rachel - It really does sound like #5 has knocked you down pretty good.  Please be kind to yourself.  I've never played any FB games, but they sound like a good distraction.  I love the idea of you staying a red head when your hair comes back - it might be the new you! Karmil - Our exchange surgeries are only 1 day apart. I'm excited to be done with surgeries too.  The new wig sounds great - it must be so much fun to try new styles. Jen - Welcome.  You did fit right in with our treatment schedules.  I had a BMX prior to chemo and feel like it was the absolute best decision for me - good luck with your surgery. Annie - So glad your exchange surgery went well.  I've read on this site that many women feel their implants were too small right after surgery but that they change so much after 2-3 months.  Hopefully you'll be happier with the size as some time goes by. Lisa - Great news on the long walk today - that was quite a distance!  You deserve some couch time.  I'm sorry to read about your night sweats, do you think it's a SE from the Arimidex?  I'm sorry your revision has been postponed, but am sure you want to be healed properly to get the best results. I took another 2 walks today, with a small rest and hydrate in-between.  My legs are still quite sore, but I know they'll hopefully soon get the point that the muscles need to start working again. Hopefully real soon!  The grunting and groaning noises I make when I get up from the couch and bed, even the toilet are pretty entertaining!  I saw my PS this morning and we set my exchange surgery for 3/27.  I'm so excited to get this over and get these TE's out of me.  He told me not to even walk for 2 weeks after the exchange, he wants my heartbeat at a resting rate for that long.  I was not too happy to hear that, but he was worried if my heartbeat go too high it might lead to bleeding.  Maybe a short slow walk couldn't hurt!  We'll see. ",

Oh, the joy of steriods, if only we could forget about that particular kind of joy. 3 days post tx and waiting for the better days to come. I know they will, I just want them now!",

Am hoping you're able to get some rest. Momof3boys - Will be thinking of you Thursday as you have your 2nd TC & hoping you have fewer SE's. Josie - My Neulasta pain lasts about 4 days after I get it, but on day 7 this time I my legs were achey and painful, but this has passed. My taste buds have taken a hike right after both treatments.  They did come back a little faster this time, after about 7 days.  I'm sure this is because I didn't get thrush this time. I lost 5 lbs. after TC #1 but gained 2 1/2 back by TC #2. The drinking clear fluids has become a real drain for me.  I stick with only water for the day before, the day of & about 3-4 days after treatment.  Then will add in iced tea, Sprite and flavored water. I've heard some women have had success with lemonaid. I haven't tried that. I guess we're all members of the sick and tired of being sick and tired club.  And I still can't figure out how to answer the \"How are you doing\" question I get from friends and family.  Do they REALLY want to hear the truth or the standard \"Doing okay\".  I'd have many fewer phone calls, emails and texts if I was truthful, so the going answer is \"Doing okay, but tired\". Maybe I should add sick and tired! ",

Heather - Love that your neighbor boys did your shoveling for you, and I'm so glad you're going to have a talk with the parents, sounds like a tough neighborhood to get to know anyone! Robin - I hear you on the sleeping pills, my onc has me on Adivan 1mg. and most nights it's not enough. For anyone have skin issues, I broke out like a teenager before my BMX actually, I thought it was just stress, but it would not clear up.  I finally wondered if the lotion I had been using for years just wasn't agreeing with me anymore, I have very sensitive skin.  Then after I started chemo it got worse and my neck was red and itchy. I finally called my sister in Denver who has a friend who is a dermatologist.  She recommended (both by Cetaphil) their product called Resoraderm, she recommended the skin restoring body wash, which I use as my facial cleanser in the morning and the Restoraderm skin restoring moisturizer.  The kicker is she told me to use Ponds Cold Cream as my nighttime facial cleanser and not to wash it off with water, but to use 100% cotton squares to wipe it off, then use the Restoraderm moisturizer.  My skin has cleared up and is so soft! My fatigue seems to be getting worse.  I'm so worried about treatment #3 this Friday, could I possibly be any more tired than I already am.   Jeez, this is just full of glass is half empty - will try to do better. Hope all are doing well. ",

Thought I would sleep the day away, but I was up at 12:20pm, so not too long of a sleep. It was my last night of oral steroids, so I was blaming it all on that! My boys came to visit today & gave me the old just one more treatment Mom speech. I just quietly reminded them what the next 2 weeks would be like for me. And after the final treatment as well. They mean well & are trying to cheer me on & I appreciate it. Unlike many of you hear, I do not need rads after my final chemo and was so sorry to read how for many of you, this will be your next step on your journey to becoming a survivor. I will still be here with my December sisters cheering them on as they continue through treatment. I have been hydrating like a mad woman since the Thursday before my Friday treatment & have not been without some kind of clear liquid all weekend, but am still retaining water from the Taxotere. I will start my diuretics & Potassium tomorrow as my onc only wants me to take it 3 days a week because of my low blood pressure. I feel so bloated & couldn't even stand to look at myself in the mirror after my shower. I'm only 5'2\" so those extra 9 lbs. are not looking too great on me. I have been avoiding clothes shopping until I was through chemo & my exchange surgery, but I placed an order last night for clothes in the size I have always worn. I'm hoping they will motivate me to lose this water weight and make me go workout as I have been very lazy about that since my BMX surgery. I know it's late again, I made the mistake & passed out watching TV tonight. I am going to take the new sleeping pill my onc just prescribed since I am pretty much through the roid rage & see if I can actually sleep through the night! It is supposed to be 65 here tomorrow, hoping I'm having a good day so I can enjoy some of that weather! Hope everyone is getting a great nights sleep and will catch up with you all soon!",

I think a hair watch club is a great thing to start.  My hairdresser told me it would take about 3 months to see it start growing back, but I have noticed a few strays here and there.  Maybe she meant before I see it all over my head.  Of course this is the year I have to renew my drivers licence, perfect right!  It's not until November, so we'll see what it's like by then.   Tomorrow usually I start my bone/joint/nerve pain and run a low dose fever for 2-3 days, but I'm prepared since it's the last time.   Have a great night everyone. ",

Ckk, what a wonderful gift of the necklace with your 4 beads on it, it is something you will cherish. Adding in on everyone who has gained that 10 lbs. since treatment began. My onc told me is was water retention from the Taxotere & did finally give in & gave me a diuretic & potassium that I can only take 3 days a week, it sure keeps me in the bathroom, but I have not lost that 10 lbs. yet! I'm only 4 days post treatment & am waiting on the bone/nerve pain & low grade fever to subside, then I can think about getting some exercise, slowly, very slowly at first. It sounds like we Weill all get different opinions from our onc's about what to expect post treatment. My onc told me the fatigue would be the last SE to leave & that would take about 6-8 weeks. I still have got to call my PS to set up an appt. to talk about my exchange surgery. I am so ready to get this over with. I know he's in the surgery office tomorrow, think I'll give the office a call then. Good night everyone!",

I've done very little of it during chemo, but both the bike & the treadmill have been on the lowest setting, you're right, we have to start somewhere. Heather, I hope your product helps with those dreaded day& night sweats you've had. Rachel, it sounds like your thrush is getting better, I'm so sorry about your knee injury. My bone pain was much better today, so I'm hoping I can cross this one off the list! While at 6 days post treatment, I'm still taking it very easy, I'm happy to report I stayed awake all day long. If I'm resting on the couch, there's a good chance I will fall asleep, so this was pretty big for me. It won't be long before spring will be here, with all the new growth of the flowers and trees and watching all the birds come back. Along with all that to look forward to, we have our own spring renewal. We will soon have new growth on our heads as our hair grows back, and slowly but surely we will get our stamina back as we all look forward to a different season.

Josie - Welcome, & you couldn't find a nicer group of supportive women than on this forum. They are always there when you need them. I love that you feel so comfortable wearing your scarves! I have a lovely wig I've never worn, too hot & itchy for me. I've either worn knit caps if its cold or ball caps. I was tested for BRCA and mine was negative. I qualified because my Mother was diagnosed at 45 with BC. I know insurance will want you to meet certain guidelines before they will pay for it. My sisters were delighted with the results of my test, as was I. Momof3 - Your treatment center sounds fabulous. I would take advantage of everything they offer - Wow! I really identified with your later post, I cry in the shower too. Bailey - Darn it, you made me tear up reading about your emotional day at your first rad treatment. I do hope you felt a little better after your cleansing. Sending you a belated hug. Heather - I did NOT like to read about you being called sir at the Farmers Market. All I'm wearing now are my ball caps since the cold weather is gone I have packed up my knit hats. I am such a wuss I would have cried. Since my last chemo, 5 1/2 weeks ago, I have hardly left the house. Like you it's the bald head, weight gain & I am just tired of looking like cancer woman. Kathy - I am so sorry your first rad appointment was tough on you also. I understand about second guessing yourself for the treatment you chose, I think we've all done that at some point, but you are right - we have to trust our Doctors who have been so well educated to know what's best for us. My choice was easy. I had 2 lumps in my left breast that were about 1 1/2 inches apart. My BS did not recommend a lumpectomy for me because they would have had to take so much tissue, & I was small breasted, that it would have left me deformed. The choice to go bilateral was all mine because of how my Mothers cancer spread from her left to her right. I have tried very hard not to second guess my decision, but there is always that little doubt. Please, please don't blame yourself for getting cancer & do try and take it easy on yourself. Wave - I swear woman, you should be writing a blog about your experiences, some of them are unreal & you do have a way of putting a smile on my face when I need it! I am so sorry to read that you've had problems sleeping - the night sweats seem to be the worst offender for me. Robin - I found it very interesting that your SIL has blocked all her emotional feelings after going through this. Should we hope we forget about ours too? I am hoping your appointment with the LE specialist went well. ckk - I was so sorry to read you've been I'll with the stomach flu. Do we all need a \"Dear God\" why me day. I did love the silver lining that you lost 5 pounds, and that your wonderful D has put you in the In Crowd with your hair - that was so sweet! Lisa - Boy, you were spot on when you wrote about everyone thinking we're just done - HA. No one in my immediate circle of family to closest friends have a clue. I've stopped trying to explain & just agree now. It seems these days I am at my best comfort level if I have a Doctors appointment, at least they seem to get it. I start my Arimidex this Friday & am just praying that the SE's of this 5 year drug (and now I've read somewhere on this board that they may change the guidelines & we may be taking it longer) are not too bad. So happy to read that your cousins biopsy was negative, what a relief. Karmil - So happy to read about your recovery from your exchange surgery. I hope you're loving the new girls! I've also read somewhere on this board that it takes 2-3 months for them to drop & fluff and by them almost all the women are happier with the size. I so agree with your denial statement - I'm not going to ever scare anyone with my own cancer stories & I don't need to hear about anyone else's. My SIL is a BC survivor and is an expert on all things BC related, don't you know! Merrinell - Welcome & I'm so happy you found us. I couldn't believe your MO didn't give you anything for nausea from the get go. What a terrible time you've been through. I hope your new treatment plan is kinder to you. The one SEvI never had was nausea - I count myself blessed for that. Rachel - I'm so excited you got your exchange date set, check that off the list! I was also happy to read that you're fighting the parking ticket, definitely use play your cancer/chemo card. I used mine the other day at Kohls. I had seen something I liked & then put it back down. By the time I got to the registar I changed my mind & asked the cashier if someone could go back & get it for me because I was on chemo and was exhausted (every word the truth, by the way) they were so nice & sent someone to get it for me. So sorry you had to start the steriods today, but girl it's your final treatment. How great does that sound! I know you've heard from all of us how the last treatment really kicked us in the butts & we only had 4, not 6 like you, so you take it extra easy on yourself in the days to come. Sending you all my best for your final treatment. I had a nice long pain pill induced rest yesterday when I got home from my exchange surgery. For some reason I was a little nauseous from the anestisea when I got home and then later that night. I took some of my composize left over from chemo & that did the trick. I woke up with a surgical compression bra on that I have to wear for 3 weeks, 24/7. I did have them give me a spare so I could always have a clean one. Pretty it is not! They also sent me home with the leg pressure cuffs & a portable motor. I have to wear them at night as a precaution against blood clots. Did not know about that until I was ready to leave. The surgery took about 2 hours, since I had the Lat D flaps done at the time of my BMX, there was a little flap at the end of each scar on my back that he repaired during this surgery as well. He tried a couple of different sizes on me during the surgery, sitting me up to see what looked best. When I was able to take my shower today, I found ugly purple bruises around the top of my arms near my armpit. I guess it's hard work to lift up dead weight during surgery. The new girls are looking good. After my shower my DH changed the dressings & the bra went back on. I'm sure I'll be very happy with them after they settle in. The pain wasn't too bad today, I've only taken 2 pain pills so may not need any tomorrow. It does feel so much better to have the TE's replaced. Recovery time will be a breeze. Talk to you lovely ladies soon!",

Rachel, that is so great of your Mom to share her brooches with you, I bet they do look great. Just my luck that my BMX was in October, of course right in the middle of Breast Cancer Awareness month, so you can guess how many BC pins I was given! I love them all & have been wearing them on the ball caps I am wearing in leu of a wig or scarves. For those of you wearing scarves, I applaud you! I've spent hours trying to get them to tie right & they just end up looking like big wads of badly tied laundry on my head! I do wear a turban when my head is chilly that one of our local cancer support groups gave me & would love to get a couple of more. Anyone have any good resources for where you got yours? I did get a couple of nice knit hats to cover my ears for when it's really cold outside.",

My blood work was all good this morning except my hemoglobin was a little low & my onc thinks this may be contributing to the extreme fatigue I've been having. I told him even with the Ativan I haven't been sleeping well at all. He did write me a script for a non narcotic sleeping pill. Plus, I gained 9 lbs. Since my last treatment, all water retention from the Taxotere. He also gave me a script for a diuretic & potassium, but he only wants me to take it 3 x a week because I have low blood pressure. I sure hope this is one SE effect that doesn't last long! My ankles & feet are awful looking. I'm doing a lot of elevating. He actually increased my steroids for this treatment since I had that reaction my first treatment to Taxotere. He also started the drip at 50 & increased it by 50 every 15 minutes until I got to 250. I've done great with no reaction, si Idon't mind going slower. I'm just about done with my Cytoxin then I'm gone. Hopefully not to go home & go in to roid rage!

And dougieswife - passing out from diarrhea & a trip to the ER for an enema, talk about one extreme to the other. No kidding, seriously! Laura - Will surely be thinking about you as you start your Taxol on Thursday & hoping you were able to hydrate. Gator - hoping you have found some relief for your pain as well. Rachel - Way to keep the BF happy with the VS coupon - I'd say that should hold you till spring. My hubs knows not even to \"speak\" of it until I am ready, so I do admire you. Heatherb - Like you, I can't tie a scarf & make it look good for the life of me. I'm so cold blooded, I thought my bald head would make me freezing this winter (at home), but it turns out it's quite the little steam engine & I rarely wear anything on it at home. Momof3 - so glad you got your nails done! Unlike you, I've lost the hair on my legs, under my arms & \"down there\" , but dang if I didn't have to pluck a chin hair - no fair! Whata- I didn't shave my hair down all the way, but did get it buzzed - that's all gone now. Bailey - Your secret is safe with me with your DH. Just do the same for me! I had my 3rd treatment last Friday, & have been having a harder than normal time with SE's from this one. The bone and nerve pain started yesterday along with a low grade fever and were the worst they have been. For 2 days I've done nothing but rest & sleep. I've kept a close eye on my temp as I have to call if it goes over 101.5, but it's remained around 100.1, just enough to make me achey all over. Hoping by tomorrow it will be somewhat better. Everyone take care & get a peaceful nights sleep. Gracie",

I can live with a messy house, wy down on my list of priorities. I'm like you, would rather not have to worry about my meals. While my DH has been great at caregiving, he is no cook, & I do worry about eating healthy meals. All the friends & realitives who were so great at bringing meals after surgery & when I first started chemo have all felt like they have done their share, not that I'm complaining, but it would be nice to still have that support system.

My taste buds have improved a little and I have been craving comfort foods, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.  They still don't taste the same, but it feels so good just to eat them.  I'm still surprised at day 16 I've got my stubble from my shaved head.  Hubs says he can see it thinning, but I thought for sure it would be gone by now.  The fatigue is my worst enemy now.  I went to visit my son yesterday, laid my head down and was out for an hour.  Happy New year everyone.  Gentle Hugs. ",
