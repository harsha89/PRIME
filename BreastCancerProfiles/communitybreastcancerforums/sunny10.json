When he did the ultrasound and felt my right breast....he told me he saw fibrosistic (sp?) activity in my RIGHT breast where the fibroademoa had been removed.  He said my body tissue may not have healed up well possibly?  He has to call my insurance and request the mamogram and BSGI.  He will be calling me back so I can schdule both.  He said he wants to make sure there are no high levels of activity (cancer??) and the BSGI will  help him see that.  I've never had a mamogram and he wants me to have one as well.  I will be honest and say I was nervous and may not have asked all the questions I should have.  I have read many questions on this Forum and it seems it is very normal to feel anxious about what is NEXT after my mamogram and BSGI (if my insurance approves).  When I had the fibroademoa procedure I did not experience AT ALL what I am now...I guess the word mamogram scares me b/c no one my age I know has ever had to  have one.  I've read of rare cases where its necessary.  If you read thru this whole thing, \"thank you\". I'm just venting to someone...I dont want to tell my  mom b/c I know she will freak out.  I have a younger sister (24) who also had a fibroadenoma removed and my poor mom was so worried :(  I don't want to blow things out of context and I'm hoping this \"worried\" feeling I feel is very common.      Log in to post a reply",
