My story: In October of this year I was sitting in my nursing class listening to my instructor talk about breast issues and the s/s of breast cancer. She mentioned that a retracted nipple could indicate both breast cancer as well as benign issues. I'm sure the look on my face said it all. My left nipple had all of a sudden become retracted in the previous few months. This got the wheels turning and I quickly went home trying my dearest to remember the last time I did a self exam. With a husband, three kids, and being a full time nursing student in my last year, things like this often get tossed aside. To my horrific surprise I found a lump at the 12 o'clock position of my left nipple. I called my ob/gyn and scheduled an appointment. After a mammogram and ultrasound that were both clear I made the decision to get a second opinion from a breast care specialist. In time it took for me to get my mammo and ultrasound results I noticed that I had a thick sticky bloody discharge from that same nipple. On the 23rd if December I had my appointment at the breast clinic with the PA. She seemed sure that this issue was completely benign. A ductal papilloma. I felt better about everything!!! I was able to enjoy the holiday with my family. She set up an appointment for a surgical consultation with the Doc. I had that appointment on January 5th. This appointment was very different. She took so much time talking to me about all the signs and symptoms. She was amazing. Of course she conducted her own exam and upon finishing she told me that she wasn't so sure that this was only a papilloma. She said she was leaning more toward ductal carcinoma. After reviewing my ultrasound she found that I had multiple dilated ducts. My heart sank. She talked to me about all my options if it was indeed cancer. She was with me for 2 hours. See I'm only 31 with absolutely no family history of any kind of cancer. She asked me if I would be willing to take part in a study. If course I agreed. So they took blood and all that stuff. I was then scheduled for my ductal excision and biopsy. It will take place on Monday the 11th. I'm scared out of mind. I have a young family. I'm a nursing student that should graduate in May. I have worked so hard. I'm SCARED of CANCER. Has anyone felt with this or know someone that has. I have no one to talk to. :( Log in to post a reply",

In my attempt to read as much as I can ;) I have seen a lot of women say that the post op pain is very minimal. They only required a small amount of pain meds and missed little to no work. My doc told me to take it easy and rest for a week. Wear a good supportive bra for a few weeks to minimize any discomfort. As far as your concerns with your surgen. The other reply was 100% correct. If your not comfortable with the surgeon or what they are saying it is your right to take your issues elsewhere. This is your body and your life!!! Don't even think twice if you are not comfortable. I may suggest if you do go somewhere else, try to go to a breast clinic. Not only are they mostly staffed by women but it is their speciality. Breasts are their area of work. In my own experience they are more thorough and considerate of you as a woman with an issue that is very personal and difficult to experience. Best of luck to you. I hope you find the answers you are looking for.",
