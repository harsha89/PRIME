Second, if you met your OOP max, you shouldn't owe any money, everything should be covered at 100% for the remainder of the year, if your benefits are on a calendar year. Unless, there is a different OOP Max for INN vs OON? Do not pay the full bill, you should not have to, if you went INN. Usually most insurance companies will pay at INN level or won't and then it eventually is reprocessed as INN, if you only have INN and did everything in your power to do what you were supposed to do.

They don't often cause pain and are just left there.  What I have found is they are very rare in the sacral region, more often those are mets.  HOWEVER, I'm not looking at this as that is what it is, the MRI was in January and this pain is nagging me again, but no one has been able to identify what it is.  And I never expected to be diagnosed with any type of cancer when I did all the testing to rule everything out. What is even more bothersome and I will talk to my Dr. about all this and my concern to have someone decipher what it is that was seen is that a lesion at that area can affect bladder, bowel etc.  I had a partial hysterectomy almost 7 years ago.  After surgery I had a neurogenic bladder for 3 months, I had to self-cath.  No one could figure out what was going on or what happened.  They started assuming I had a muscle issue (ie MS) and the trauma of surgery had caused it to manifest itself.  I lived in TX at the time and they referred me to Baylor or a place in Houston to see a specialist.  I was so over Dr's, tests and the unknown I didn't do that and it eventually got better.  So, I wonder if whatever is there was the cause then too. The pain has been intermittent for a year now, but in the same area sometimes bothersome and sometimes very painful.",

I was having some severe back back on my lower right side near my sacro joint (still have it).  Had an MRI as Dr. thought maybe sacroiliitis.  MRI was not with contrast.  Findings came back with no sign of sacroiliitis, but read \"There is a focus of increased T2 signal within the sacral body at the level about S2 measuring about 8mm in size, this is hyperintense on T2 and T2 fat-sat images.  The lesion is poorly identifiable on the T1-weighted images.  Differential could include an atypical hemangioma without fat or potentially the presence of metastasis.  I do not see additional lesions.   What I have found is hemangioma's are rare in that region. What complicates this is, I said \"what do we do to confirm or deny that report?\"  Dr said have you had your well woman exam as mostly likely any metastasis would come from breast or pelvic?? If everything comes back negative, we will revisit this.   So, I did all that (I had not had a mammo in 3 years, various reasons, but none good).  Well, lo and behold I am dx'd with DCIS Grade 3.  Well, that is contained so it has nothing to do with that.  I had an MRI before surgery on both breasts and nothing additional showed up.   I still have that pain and that finding still bothers me.  Now that I'm with a multidisciplinary center (MD Anderson) I want to talk to someone about reviewing the MRI CD. Can someone have metastasis and not know the source? Thank You for any input.",

However, what I wanted to chime in on.  I go to MD Anderson and I asked about the 10 years as the study was making full steam in May.  I went on Tami almost a month ago (knock on wood, no SE's).  My oncologist said the change from 5-10 years was based on one study and as an academic hospital they are not going to change the protocol based on one study.  If in the next 5 years more come out, I could be on it for 10 years, but for now it is 5.   So certain area's standard of care, but there is still a lot of gray area.  1mm margins for many is too close?  ",

My tumor was fairly small, the bigger issue for me was that it was grade 3, small margins, near my chest wall and I'm PR- which seems to put me in a category with a more aggressive tumor.  I ended up having to do 7 weeks of radiation and 2 of those were boosts. The imaging center where I had the biopsy gave me a referral to a breast surgeon, etc.  But I had a friend who had just gone through this and asked her who she had used.  She went to MD Anderson and I went there and have had a multidisciplinary approach that I think benefits any and all cancer patients.  Everything is under one roof, your team works together and if there is any question about treatment it goes to the board. RADS was not to bad and amazingly I am normally hypersensitive to drugs, but have had virtually no SE's with Tamoxifen and have now been on it about 6 weeks.  I take it at night and was having insomnia, but MO NP said that isn't normally an SE and we (both of us) attributed it to my my mind not being about to shut off.  She said to take .25mg of Benadryl before I got to bed and that seems to be doing the trick.

I am DCIS, but grade 3 which is  the aggressive type.  Also, I took people with me to the first few appointments when this was all so new to me, I was overwhelmed and still in shock that this was happening to me, but at this point I like to go alone.  Not sure why, but I do.   Keep me posted and HUGS!",

Surgery wasn't bad at all, I was down a few days.  I took pain pills for a day and switched to Tylenol as I'm just sensitive to side effects.  It is still healing though, still swollen, still a little sore and get those zingers from nerve regeneration.  It is itchy as well, which means healing.  Scar is on side (mine was at 3:00 position) and only about 1.5\".  She was even able to glue it so less scarring. Radiation for me will be 6 weeks.  5 weeks of daily full breast and then 1 week of daily boosts.   Get through your surgery and then you are in a holding pattern waiting for healing.  Still meeting with Dr's, but have a 4-6 weeks of healing.",

If it comes back positive and you have a multidisciplinary cancer center in your area usually a NCI designated one go to one of those.  They makes things less burdensome and are cutting edge.  Best wishes.",

Nikkito, my surgery was 9 days ago and I'm doing great.  Still swollen still sore, but back to the day to day grind add in a bunch of appointments.  I'd say that is what changes your life so much with this, all the appointments become your job in the first few weeks.  Well, it extends beyond that as I haven't started rads yet, but keeping track of appointments has kept me busy.  Thankful I am with a great network that does it all for me. I do hope that both of you get good news and aren't on this journey, but if you are this is a great place.  It keeps me sane to come read.  If I'm feeling sorry for myself I come read here. My life is a bit different at the moment and for those around me, their life continues without this little interruption.  HUGS!",

I'm also very thankful that once I met my surgeon I was in surgery in less than a week.  Really the worst part of this is waiting, because we want to move forward and move on from this part of our lives.  ",

I was told for me (small breasted) if they had to go back in I would have had a big pocket of empty space and needed to do some type of reconstruction.  Mastectomy has it's own set of issues. My friend had one and is still working on the symmetry part as it was just one side.  She is going in for additional surgery later this month.  And you loose all feeling and sensitivity.  Going the chemo/radiation route is very time consuming. I know you have to do chemo, but where does radiation play into this for you?  My radiation will be 6 weeks, I think 33 treatments.  Will find out the final plans for that after my 1 month surgical follow-up this week.   And for me, I have implants, nursing 3 babies made a mess of me and no clothes fit.  So 6 years ago I had implants to get back what I had lost.  I'm at huge risk of having capsular contraction on that side after radiation and will have to have surgery to fix it.  They wait 6 months as it takes 6-12 months for everything to settle down after radiation. Take one day at a time, look at all your options, pro's and con's and what is important to you at this moment.  I'm not sure how old you are, but you said you are very young.  You have a great team of Dr's and are at a great facility. I can tell you I have days where I look at this as something to get through and move back to my normal \"boring\" life. But, I also have days of anxiety.  The odds of this happening are small, what next? I'm a total glass half full type person too. It just really changes you in so many ways. I am thankful that I meet so many wonderful people each time I go into clinic.  I am getting to know some that I see often.  I also see very sick people and am thankful my diagnosis is totally curable.  My goal is to do what I have to do, to close this chapter and hopefully never worry about it again.  HUGS!",

I want to echo something 70 mentioned.  Do you have a nurse navigator at Mayo?  I have one and the first thing she said to me and I hold it close as I've encountered it a bit already.  \"This is the time for you to be selfish and focus on YOU.\"  Do not worry about anyone else's feelings or making them feel better about your situation.  One thing, I didn't want anyone who had been unkind to me, to be nice because of this.  That happened with a neighbor, she sent me a text the day I had surgery and I never responded.  She was upset yada yada.  Really, made my situation about her.  You don't have time for that, you have work ahead! Let those who want to help, help (hard for me as I'm better at helping others) and let those who want to shower you with love do it.  I find comfort in my inner circle.
