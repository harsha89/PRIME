So far only my husband knows.  A few times I have wavered and thought about calling a friend or two.  After reading your posts, I think I will continue to keep it to myself, at least until the results.  Possibly even after....",

      "Content": "krandle wrote: Here's my story so far... I am a 40 year old mom of 6 beautiful kids.  I have no medical history because I am the product of a closed adoption.  Although I have never found any lumps in my breasts, at my last annual exam my doctor said I should go do a mammogram to get baseline images because of my lack of medical information.  Normally, she doesn't recommend women begin mammograms until 45. So, last Monday I went to get squished for the first time (at least in a doc's office ).  I was nervous about the procedure and if it would be painful or embarrassing.  It turned out to be both in moderation, but it went as smoothly as can be expected.  The staff were very nice, and I was literally finished in 10 minutes from the time they started taking the pictures.  The technician was a middle aged woman who told me that I should expect a letter in 7 days saying that the results were clear.  If there was anything concerning, I would get a phone call for follow up images taken at a hospital within 1 week.  She told me that they often find abnormalities and call you back, but that it usually is nothing, so not to freak out if it happens. I left the mammogram building very relieved to have it behind me.  I was a little sore, but otherwise, the experience left my mind.  Two days later, I got a phone call saying that I needed to come in right away because of abnormalities found in both breasts!!  Needless to say, I freaked out.  This was only supposed to be a first time baseline.  They weren't supposed to find anything!! The day before Thanksgiving, I went to the hospital breast care center for follow up.  They took what seemed like hundreds of mammogram images.  The technician kept leaving to confer with the radiologist, and she would order more views, and we just kept going like that for about 20 minutes, until finally, they told me the radiologist was going to do an ultrasound on both breasts.  It was all very scary.  The staff was wonderful throughout. Finally during the ultrasound, it was determined that one side was just a fluid filled cyst (very small and no need to drain since it wasn't bothering me), and the other side was possibly a fibroadenoma, but they couldn't be sure without a biopsy.  I had the biopsy today and the agony of waiting and worrying about it over the long Thanksgiving weekend has been excrutiating.  I was glad to get it over with. I couldn't sleep at all last night, and used my relaxation sounds and even hypnosis MP3's to get a few winks. I take a lot of vitamins and herbal stress relievers, but was told not to take any of these things for 5 days before the procedure because they can act as blood thinners and cause excess bleeding (right when I needed my stress relievers the most!!!).  I read up on different forums (like this one) what to expect for the biopsy, and it was all pretty accurate.  They didn't use a special table....just a regular exam table with a wedge under my side and my arm over my head (which got uncomfortable towards the end).  They gave me a stress ball to squeeze with my other hand, which was good because beforehand I was gripping the towel they had spread over me.  The truth is, if you have ever had a baby or had an epidural, this needle biopsy is a piece of cake - the former \"procedures\" are 100 times worse!  The soreness now isn't too bad.  The nurse led me to believe I would be in a considerable amount of pain, but honestly, I am just a little achey with no acute pain. Anyway, I won't have results until Thursday.  So, more agonized waiting.  For some reason I feel very negative.  I feel like each step, I have been told everything will be normal, or not to worry.  However, each step has led to something to worry about.  Plus, and I know this sounds nuts, the staff were sooo nice to me....that I feel like they know I have cancer.  The receptionist remembered me from last week's tests and gave me this huge greeting.  The nurses seemed overly attentive.  I am getting a very bad vibe.  Of course, it could just be my own neurosis that no one could possibly be nice to me for no reason!  I really hope that is the case!  I would rather be crazy than have cancer.  At least I am familiar with crazy!

      "Content": "Nov 30, 2010 07:40PM - edited Dec 2, 2010 10:18AM by krandle First off, I did get the good news that my mass is a benign fibroadenoma!  These last two days have been agonizing, waiting for news.  I haven't yet talked to my doc about what kind of follow up she wants me to do.  I will call her office in an hour or so when the reception desk is open. Thank you so much to everyone who talked me through this - especially those of you in the chat room!  You were life savers. This has been a life altering experience for me.  I certainly feel my own sense of mortality and a new appreciation for my health.  I do know that overnight, it can all change, so I had better make the most of life and stay positive in the present.  I tend to worry and think the worst.  Perhaps I think that if I get bad news, it will pale in comparison to what I have been imagining, so the bad news won't seem so bad? I am very grateful to have this episode behind me, and hope that everyone here waiting for tests has good news too.  If not, I wish you a speedy recovery and peace of mind.",
