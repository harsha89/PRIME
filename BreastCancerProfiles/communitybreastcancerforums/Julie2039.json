I have 3 substantial in each breast although measure up to 26mm each so no cause to remove. He rubbished my idea that thyroid could contribute to them appearing. I am going to write to clinic. Although they are harmless it is how it is affecting me and he didn't seem at all interested in thatÂ ",

Â I am high risk breast cancer due to family history and am currently in the throes of genetic counselling with a view to testing. I also receive annual mammograms (age 41). Â Since the first lump was found I have since found one in my left breast and two in my right. I have regular ultrasound scans which have revealed 8/9 fibros in my left along with cysts, none of which I can feel, and pre Xmas I found another lump in my right. Â I am finding lumps around every three to four months and as a result am always at the hospital for scans, mammograms and family clinic counselling. Â Whilst extremely grateful I am being closely monitored I am so depressed with it all and sick of the sight of the place ðŸ˜Ÿ. Â Every mammogram i have i have a referral for a new finding. My question is what do I do? My consultant isn't concerned and denies the fact I could be a higher cancer risk although I read it can increase if only slightly. Â I try to read up on fibros but information is conflicting. The hospital are inclined to leave the lumps. The ones in my right are 1cm to 2cm at present although feel so much bigger and I don't want them there. Anyone out there any advice or experience. The thought of this ongoing and new lumps appearing in future years gets me down. Thanks x Log in to post a reply",
