If so how often?   I had my first B12 today mainly because I have been so exhausted that I actually was thinking of quitting chemo.  In 2 days I will have the 3rd once a month  of 4 Taxols, have already had the 4 A+C, then after Taxol will have Herceptin once a month for 12 times.  I hope my MO  will tell me it is ok to have a B12 shot every other day  I don't just believe in miracles, I depend on them Log in to post a reply",

Now hair is thinning out so much that I'm going to wear a hat, wig or whatever.  I also have had 2 haircuts since beginning chemo, more for the styling as hair was still growing.  Wondering if my luck has run out.",
