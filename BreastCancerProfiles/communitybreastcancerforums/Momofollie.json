Due to the feel and look of the lump she thought it was probably a cyst or potentially an ingrown hair. However, because of the location she referred me for an ultrasound and mammogram tomorrow afternoon. I'm scared to death! I have two little ones at home and a great hubby. My anxious mind keeps having all negative thoughts. Of course I've been googling way too much and it's not making it any better. I remembered that three months ago my breasts were tender for like three days but the tenderness went away so I did nothing. Then I read that nipple discharge could be a sign so Isqueezed my breasts and sure enough a tiny little bit of clear fluid came out. So now I'm totally freaked out. Anyone else have original symptom of arm pit lump? Does this mean it's an a more advanced breast cancer Log in to post a reply",
