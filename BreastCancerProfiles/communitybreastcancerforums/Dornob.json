Last August I was beautiful! My face was firm, smooth like silk absolutely no wrinkles or sagging skin on my face and neck. Not anymore, no matter what I have tried to do to reverse the damage.I now have turkey neck. I look and feel like I've aged 20 years in less than a year. Yes, thankfully my breast cancer stage 2 is gone :) along with my right breast:( and I lost 25 lbs. But looking this old has made me very depressed. I am having a difficult time adjusting to life as it was before the diagnosis of breast cancer. Is anyone else going through this same phase? .",

I will have a port inserted on Wednesday July 19 for four chemo treatments to shrink the tumor and surgery will follow. There is so much to this diagnosis that confuses me, especially the diagnosis it's self that I never expected after my yearly mammogram . I saw nothing abnormal on the surface and was taken by total surprise. God bless us all.",

      "Content": "Nov 12, 2018 02:59PM - edited Nov 12, 2018 03:50PM by Dornob After my yearly mammogram In June 2017, I was diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma, stage 2, grade 3 (3cm x 2 cm in diameter) HER2/NEU Positive (3+1) in my right breast. I received treatments Docetaxel (Taxotere), Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Pertuzumab (Perjeta) before surgery. When treatments of these cancer drugs ended, I was told the tumor had shrunk and no longer existed. On December 22, 2017 I had a complete mastectomy followed by reconstruction. The two lymph nodes that were surgically removed were cancer free eliminating the need of radiation. After surgery I continued to take Trastuzumab (Herceptin) for a year.. One of many side effects with the drug Taxotere, is permanent hair loss. I became one of those unlucky few who appears to have permanent baldness, loss of eyebrows and eye lashes due to this drug. While I thank God that all seems well with my health now, I am not happy with my hair loss. I was told the class action law suite against the Taxotere company are for those who received treatment before 2015 as this was before there was a warning label of this possible side effect. (FYI) ",
