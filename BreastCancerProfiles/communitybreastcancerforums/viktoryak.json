And one of the reasons i am doing cold caps is also for him so he is not upset that his mama has no hair somehow it is the scariest thing for him. But now he knows now all details on cold caps i do even does inet research. ",

I only had so far one bad day. First day after treatment I was taking at easy no exercise. But following day I run /walked 4 miles. Friday was so far worst day. I had a lot of lower abdominal pain that was generating toward rear and sides. I called Dr. office they said it can be no worries unless i have fever. So I did elliptical, ignored pain and went to birthday party where danced till midnight. Next day was better. I run/walked 3.5 miles. I do get tiered after it and need to rest for a while but I am happy so far i can still work out. Yes, yes I am a fitness frick. Used to go to gym 4-5 times a week but afraid of germs now. Figured i will better exercise at home or run. I am so afraid of wight gain on all these meds that it is such a force to move for me. Also I noticed it helps a lot with depression. Whenever I feel sorry for myself this week and start to cry I pull myself out of the bed and move . I am praying it will be the same for the rest of 11 weeks, but I know people say it gets worst the more you do it. So worried about tomorrow and next week. I also do cold capping and since hair didn't start shedding yet I guess i feel normal but I know it will be starting on day 17 and I am terrified.  ",

It sounds crazy but I can't wait to go and get my next chemo... I guess it's because it is makes me one more step forward toward the end..I understand you probably emotional wreck but stay strong.

Some chemo regiments don't make you so sick as others. My first week was great I run.exersised . yes a few minor SE but so far not so bad. I know it should get worst toward the end but I hope not so much. also hair...with some regiments you can use cold caps that might preserve some or all hair. I am trying it. To early to tell if it works. But I hope it will.  From your message I didn't understand did you have a surgery yet? What is a plan so far?",

I had a chance to pre planed vacation in Costa Rica for my son's school holiday ,5 weeks after surgery.(MO let me do it) I did zip-line, many hikes and all active staff I did before stupid cancer.And I felt so much the same finally the minute I left New York... I felt there no cancer there and I am back to old myself. But I had to face reality and go back for treatments :( Now chemo then radiation next and a year Herceptin injections every 3 weeks. Hope I can be active.. I hate not to exercise and so scared of weight gain... Hope taxol will be gentle on me. Good luck to you, KQHill , I hope your chemo regiment will not be to difficult!! We are here for you. Honestly , this forum keeps me going. I am so addicted to talking to you all girls! It really helps me a lot with my emotions and know that there people i can talk to. ",
