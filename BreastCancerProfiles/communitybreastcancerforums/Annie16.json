It sure seems as though my 4 rounds of TC (Taxotere and Cytoxan) are an easier go than those of you on the AC+T routine. Rounds 3 and 4 made me very tired. I didn't bounce back as fully or as quickly (or, maybe it was that I had a college student home then and keeping us up to all hours) from Round 3. I am finished now - about 5 days out from my last treatment and scheduled to start with radiation (hypo-fractionated course so 16 treatments plus 4 boosts) on February 13th. This approach to radiation delivers the same total dose in fewer sessions (fractions) and has demonstrated comparable effectiveness out 15 years - and possibly reduced side effects. They will only use it is you are over 50 because they are waiting for more time/date more to confirm longer term effectiveness. I mention it just so you can have the conversation with your radiation oncologist if it might be appropriate for you. I am looking forward to recovering a little bit of my energy before losing it again with radiation. One other thing to mention - I have also found a surprising lack of awareness about not using the arm impacted by surgery for blood pressure, shots, infusions etc. My oncology team is good about it, but the hospital staff seems to be unaware. I had to have a resection to clear up margins and I expressed some concerns about it and they put a red band on my arm so that folks would leave that arm alone during surgery when I wasn't conscious and able to defend it! It is something you all might ask for if you find yourself having any other surgery or hospital admit where many staff come and go and might not know the protocol. I am sending you all what little extra energy I have as you keep moving through this and celebrating your progress!",

For those of you starting Taxol and hearing about longer infusion times, they do the same thing with Taxotere which is a 'cousin', if you will, of Taxol. They are concerned that you not have an allergic reaction (rare, but possible) so they drip it very slowly. Also, my MO recommended I take B6, which may possibly help with the neuropathy associated with these drugs.

As a result, compazine might be more effective than Zofran for the first 48 hours. After that, apparently, Zofran is your first choice, with compazine along side it as needed. Obviously, go over this with your doctor, but for those of you dealing with nausea, I hope this help.

I start radiation in mid-February so I am hoping to regain some energy before that starts. Still, forward momentum is good! It sure is annoying to not be able to taste food. I told someone that, while I hope I don't have to choose, I think I would choose taste buds over hair. (And, how is it that I can still gain weight while not enjoying food?!) I do not have any lymphedema issues - although I understand they can crop up at any time. I hope the PT works for you. I am going to ask the surgeon more about monitoring for that in the future. My understanding is that it is easier to deal with if you catch it early. BG46TN - that's excellent news about your tumor shrinking. One of the downsides of doing surgery first is that you don't really know if the chemo is working. I wonder if it is your genetics report that has them considering radiation?

I had my first treatment on November 15th (same as you, Aldea, TCx4) which put me out of commission for days 4-8. I woke up on day 9 feeling noticeably better and have been improving since then. This 21 day cycle does give you time to recover a bit. The chemo made me feel 'bleh', but I think (based on timing) that the Neulasta shot was the real kicker. I had pain in my neck, primarily. (You can imagine the jokes I suffered when I mentioned that to my children!) Oddly, the worst pain was on day 8 and that was pretty bad lower back pain. This is with Claritan. It wasn't the worst pain, but it definitely wasn't fun and they cautioned me not to overdo the ibruprofen because they don't want you masking a fever. The fatigue is real - and precipitous. I was really fortunate in terms of nausea and I sure hope that good luck continues. I received three anti-nausea meds in the IV: Aloxi, Zofran, and the Dexamethazone (steroid) which helps with nausea also. They sent me home with Compazine and Zofran. I didn't need them, but I am listening to all of you, though, about taking them right away at the first sign of trouble. Did anyone else have trouble with water retention in the days right after your infusion. It abated, but it was crazy for about 48 hours. Maybe I was overdoing the water...but I felt sooo good about drinking all of that water to wash those chemicals out of my system. My next chemo treatment is December 6th. I am glad to now have some idea what to expect. Hair started to go on Sunday. That's a bummer, but one good thing about living in upstate NY is we'll all be under hats for the next 4-5 months.
