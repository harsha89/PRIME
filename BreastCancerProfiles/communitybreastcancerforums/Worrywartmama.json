I had some yellow/green nipple discharge from my left breast back in December of 2016. I saw my GP and she felt it was nothing but told me to have my first mammo within the next 6 months. (I should mention I have some health anxiety and have been TERRIFIED to have a mammo for fear of bad news) I finally worked up the courage and had my mammo in August of 2017. Wouldn't you know I get \"the call\" to come back for more images and an ultrasound on both breasts. TERROR sets in. But I somehow make it to the appointment that same day (thank you amazing medical community I live in). They saw microcalcifications in both breasts and a fibroadenmoa and possible cyst in the left. I was sent on my way with instructions to come back in 6 months for a follow up. Fast forward to this past month and WHAM - a bloody nipple on the left. So I squeeze and green discharge came out. Now in the morning that nipple has dried blood on it but the only stuff that actually comes out is green. What is happening ?? My 6 month follow up is coming up in 2 weeks Log in to post a reply",
