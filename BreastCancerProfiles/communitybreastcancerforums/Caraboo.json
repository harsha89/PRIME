I see my MO this afternoon and he is going to test the port if that goes well I start my A/C on 4/11. I am hoping to have chemo on Thursday afternoons ( my MO only does Tuesdays &Thursdays) and then go to work on Monday. I am going to get my haircut short this weekend - it is currently mid back length so this will be a somewhat traumatic event but as with everything else it will be short lived. Good luck to all, and prayers for minimal SE's...",

I will be doing 4 treatments of A/C every two weeks and then 4 treatments of Taxotere very 3 weeks. I feel that this is the most scary part of the entire process, the biggest unknown - not knowing how my body will react to the treatments. I am trying to read posts from past months to gather as much info as possible on how to deal with SE's. My MO has gone over SE's with me but everything is so overwhelming. I am trying to stay as upbeat as I possibly can but some days are hard. I want to try and work during treatment and I am hoping that I will be able to. I wish everyone the best of luck, and positive thoughts to all.",

As for PT, my oncologist told me if I feel up to it I can do it. I am hoping that I will be able to function because I would like to work between treatments! Prayers and best wishes to you that all goes well.",
