I was on the fence re: reconstruction.  I actually really liked my flat chest, because 3 weeks post mastectomy, I felt really good - no pain, and was getting back to my healthy active lifestyle.  My husband didn't care.... he loves the \"me\" - my \"being\", and the extra skin on the chest is nice, but not necessary.  What tipped the scale for me in favor of reconstruction, was just for practical purposes...... I love to run, weight lift, swim, etc..... I talked to some with prosthesis, and they said it was a hassle. I had tissue expanders placed 3 weeks ago.  To be honest, having the tissue expanders in is pretty uncomfortable.  I miss the pain-free flat chest, but I've been told that once I get the permanent  implants, I will feel good. It is nice to know that implants don't have to be permanent.  If for some reason I decide I don't like them, I can have them taken out.  I think I will like them once I'm done with this \"expander\" process.  Right now, I'm just looking forward to getting these tissue expanders switched out, and getting on with my life.  I go in for my first \"fill\" on Monday. Best wishes to all of you awesome ladies!  Each woman's journey/choices is uniquely hers, but there sure is a lot of helpful input, support and comradery in the sharing. God bless you all, Sue",

Do you have family or close friends nearby that can surround you with love and support?  Some of your words concerned me (Sep. 11th, you said you were feeling very suicidal).  You have all the support of the wonderful ladies on this site, but don't hesitate to seek a counselor who can walk with you during this stressful time....Also, if there is a breast cancer support group that meets in your area.... just some thoughts to share. When I was diagnosed, there were 3 ladies in my church that are breast cancer OVERCOMERS and they surrounded me like mother hens.  They helped me process the whole experience... Just be sure to continue to reach out to recieve all the tangible support you need.  You are loved. Your life matters.  You can beat this!  God bless you MIGHTILY.  We all are here to support you...... Sue",
