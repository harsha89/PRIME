The rash (2 hard acne looking little lumps) appeared under my right armpit on Friday morning (8 days after my second tx). My onc suspected I had Shingles but when I saw him that afternnoon he confirmed I had infected follicles. Not sure how the rash in other places isn't bad but it is under my armpit. I haven't shaved in weeks since I lost under arm hair from chemo. My onc gave me a prescription for an antibiotic but asked me not to fill it unless the rash spreads. He also recommended warm moist compresses 4 times a day. The lumps are painful and have started to get bigger as they look like they are becoming one. It hurts constantly so I can't really use my arm all that much right now. I am going to give it one more day and if I see no improvement tomorrow I will call my Onc and see if I need to start on these antibiotics. Please call you Onc. It's probably just a rash but you want to get checked out just in case.",

Even with insurance, the bills just keep coming and I am graced with being able to pay the coinsurance. Good Luck with Surgery on Wed. I wish you the best and hope you have a quick and smooth recovery. I am scheduled for surgery on June 15th. Due to the large area of DCIS in my small left breast as well as the location of it, mastectomy was really the only option for me. After many sleepless nights and doing tons of research I decided last week that I would have a bilateral mastectomy. They biopsied an area on my right breast and determined it was benign, but they wanted to \"watch\" it and want to take a look at it in 6 months. For me, my young age, as well as more biopsies, annual testing, fear of BC occurring on the healthy was just too overwhelming to think about. I have a little bit of anxiety here and there thinking about what that final pathologist report is going to say after they test all of my breast tissue. I pray they do indeed just find pure DCIS on the left breast and hopefully nothing on my right breast. The past few weeks six weeks since diagnosis have been a blur. It will be a long year since I will be having immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders and implants. In the end though I will be happy to hopefully be cured and move on with my life. Yasmin",

I don't live day to day thinking I am going to die from BC, but I can't help but get disturbed when I come across studies like this.

Depending on how large the cancer is depends on whether you can have good cosmetic results with a lumpectomy. Due to the large area of cancer I had and since it was Multifocal and I had little breast tissue, my breast surgeon said a mastectomy was best for me. He felt a lumpectomy would leave me looking disfigured. BS had to take tissue clear up to my collarbone. I would suggest asking a breast surgeon and plastic surgeon how much breast tissue needs to be taken and what you might look like after surgery. I have no idea on how to deal with HMOs. Hopefully someone will help. Maybe post on the Help me through treatment forum asking those with HMOs for help? Good Luck!",

I am nervous about tx but I am trying to stay positive. Hopefully, I will have little side effects. I am not as nervous about losing my hair as I am about what it will look like when it comes back. I have talked to some BC survivors that have had regrowth with different hair texture and some with straight hair have curly hair now. Oh well.. I guess we'll see. My Oncologist did not give me any prescriptions to take before tx this Thursday. Is this normal? He said I would be given Emend the day of tx. Also, how much exercise have you been able to do during tx. I am wondering if I will be able to keep up with my current workout program. I typically lift weight 3 days a week and do moderate cardio 4-5 days a week. Best wishes to all.",
