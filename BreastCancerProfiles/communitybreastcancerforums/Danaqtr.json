The doctor ordered mammogram and ultrasound. In the second day, the doctor phoned me and said there is high lesion in the left breast. I asked her what does it mean? She said this means BAD NEWS. I was dying when I heard that. I left my work running to the hospital asked for the report. I got a copy of the report the tumor size 14*10mm in the 11 o\u2019clock. BI RADS 4. Red flag I looked to the images, the tumor looks like star not regular round. Im not clinician but trying my best to interpret the images and compare it to other benign images (hoping it will benign) Unfortunately the doctor is difficult to reach. The nurse scheduled a biopsy, which we had 3 days ago. I told the result Shouq be today (Thursday) or Sunday. Im too worry and all my hope it will turn benign. Im so scared about her. She is old and can\u2019t tolerate cheom and other tough medicine. I m planning to take her outside my country to USA or Germany but not sure where is the best. I heard of MD Anderson is top ranked. Any suggestions? Log in to post a reply",
