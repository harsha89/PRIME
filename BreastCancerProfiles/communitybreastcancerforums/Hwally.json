I think we all agree that is vital. Also, I'm gathering tha you have not actually been diagnosed with lymphedema yet? If not please correct me. If you are at risk but have not been diagnosed yet then some mild exercises are good for you, but i would probably recommend using some form of mild compression while doing them. Others here can tell you if resistance bands are a good idea or not, I used them when I first had Axillary cording to stretch my cord and it actually helped, but later switched to walking as a form of exercise that works for me. Everyone is different. but it sounds like your PT is suggesting them for a non-lymphedema related purpose, is that correct?  I see an occupational therapist and a certified fitter, I do not need to see the therapist regularly, since my lymphedema is fairly the same with only small flare ups that I have learned to handle. Some states have different laws on access to therapy and do require referrals. As far as measurements go, if your therapist measured your arm and it had a smaller measurement than your other arm, I would take that as a good sign that you might not need to visit a therapist for extreme MLD therapy. Even when I was in therapy, I saw my therapist for a week or so, then every two weeks for a month, then every six months. You may not need that if you are not swelling. Which is not to say that you shouldn't keep up a good preventative routine (self-massage, compression garments with new exercise routines and especially for flying or travel, good skin care). Lastly, I would state that your therapist should be open, communicative and willing to answer any questions. If not, it is not worth seeing them. ",

      "Content": "Hwally wrote: Hi all, This is something that is preying on my mind so I am hoping for some advice. I am currently struggling to receive diagnoses on a breast lump along with a swollen Axillary lymphnode. Back in early December I noticed a large, soft lump in my armpit. In about two weeks (before I could get to a doctor) it became extremely painful to the touch and basically felt like I was holding a baseball under that arm. This situation is complicated because I recently moved to Maine because my husband is in grad school. I hadn't found a primary dr yet. I went to a dr who suggested I have it ultrasounded. She put me on a course of antibiotics which I had an allergic reaction to and had to be admitted to the er for severe hives. The er gave me a heavy dose of steroids which seemed to help the lymphnode some because it stopped hurting. The ultrasound came back at 1.4 cm and that dr wanted to have it completely biopsied. Then I was referred to a surgeon who specializes in oncology. The surgeon did not think it needed biopsy. She was convinced it was cat scratch disease because I have two cats and sent me on my way. Two months later and I am still having off and on pain in the lymphnode, though not as bad. About a week ago I noticed a lump in the upper tissue of my breast (almost in my chest) on the same side as the lymphnode. Back to the surgeon and she says we should do another ultrasound, this time on the node and the breast lump. She also felt the lump and She said it was probably a fat lump caused by injury. I called the office to check in a few days later after not hearing back and the nurse told me the ultrasound came back \"fine\". I proved her further and she said it was a benign lump ( although she didn't say what type) and that the lymphnode is still the same size but nothing to worry about. I have plans on calling back to see if I can actually talk to the surgeon to see if I can get more information. I guess I'm wondering If I should be concerned at this point about something serious. I am 26 with no family history of breast cancer. I do think I have had a history of a weakened immune system though - i have had recurring uti's and excema. Should I get a second opinion or just wait it out and see if these issues go away? I am very nervous and can't stop worrying about it and coupled with being 2000 miles away from home this is very hard. Log in to post a reply",

I asked her about the possibility that because I have denser breast tissue that it might be hiding it on the ultrasound but she said she didn't think that was the case because the lump is very high up (it is almost on my chest - about 4-5 inches above the nipple). I asked if there were other tests we could do to check for it - mammogram, ct or mri and she didn't think any of those would show it because it is so small.  She thought it was completely nothing to worry about but that if I wanted to she could refer me to a breast surgeon to see if they think it should be biopsied. I hate to push for surgery but after reading so many posts from people with my same problem who say that you never know - I also think it is worthwhile to get checked out by another doctor. Especially since I am still having breast pain/lymphnode pain in the area.  So now I am just waiting in anxiety to see another surgeon.  Holly",

It turns out that it was benign - which is great. The only problem on the path report was that it said the lymph node was \"scarred\" which can be caused by any kind of inflamation, although the lymph node was cultured and no infection was found. This was frustrating because I was at least hoping for something as an answer.  I just saw the surgeon for a follow up post-biopy (they put me under and removed the one lymph node) and and she seemed flummoxed by the fact that my arm pit area is still swollen even after the lymph node removal. She basically told me that she had no idea what else could be wrong. She thought it might be a piece of breast tissue that had swollen in that area but had no idea why.  Obvously now I am having nerve pain from the surgery but I still have random breast twinges/ pain in the area between my breast and arm pit. It is harder to distinguish now because I am still recovering from the surgery. To me, the tissue in my arm pit feels like it has gotten harder/thicker since I first starting having this issue. I have not felt the lump in my breast that I felt a few months ago - it seemed to diminish and go away.  Does anyone know more about random breast tissue swelling of the armpit? Should I be concerned that this came out of no where? I have read online that accessory/ectopic breast tissue can occur with hormonal changes such as pregnancy but there is no way I have been/am pregnant (and since this has been going on for 5 months I think we would know by now). Obviously I am hoping that with the lymph node removal most of my issues will go away after I have recovered but I don't want to discount that I  and my doctors might be missing something.",

I was told by my lymph therapist to always wear the sleeve + glove during heavy activity. (i.e. shoveling, heavy housework, excercise, etc). I wear the glove all the time. I only wear the sleeve occasionally (during activity, if my arm is bothering me). I think it is an individual thing - if your arm feels lymphy and achy you should certainly wear the sleeve. You should definately wear it during heavy activity. Otherwise I think it is up to you. Holly",
