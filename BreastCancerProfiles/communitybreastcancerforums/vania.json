It starts with 3,5 cm but now are 6 cm each!!! The disease on bones and lung are well controlled by fulvestrant and palbociclib but the adrenal mets increased so my oncologist decide to radiate them. I am a little worried about it because I m afraid to loose completely the functionality of the the glands. Do anyone of your oncologist suggest radioterapy? Do your adrenal gland still work or not? How big your mets are? Thank you for answering. I do not know anyone else with adrenal gland metastasis and even my oncologist seems don't have a big experience about it. Best wishes PS Sorry for my english!! I'm italian !!",
