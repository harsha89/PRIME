I know that she had been having some personal issues over the last few years following a divorce but I never thought she would leave. This woman was one in a million. As an oncologist she was a specialist in advanced breast cancer and traveled the world studying. She was on top of her game. As a person, she was so compassionate and beautiful in every way. She even met my oldest daughter for coffee just to talk as my daughter has an enormous fear of doctors and she wanted to show her how doctors are just regular people. Seriously, what kind of oncologist does this for her patients. I am feeling a lot lost. The other oncologists at the cancer center are good but pale in comparison. This is heavy on my mind. I was supposed to have an appointment with her in June so I guess I will go and see what the other doctor is like but feel like I need to start searching for the best I can find.

She already has a lot of bone pain in her legs and doesn't feel like she would handle additional pain from the shot.  Thanks Ladies.

I totally thought they would not even need to stitch me at all.    So after all that .. the point is ... check your bodies and moles.  Mine was a flat irregular shaped and very dark spot.  Not very big but appeared sort of out of the blue.   He said the correlation is very strong with B/C so it is important for us to be checked.  I know with all the appointments we have to go to and treatments who feels like going for a skin check.  I know i sure didn't and if it were for the vanity of getting that ugly liver spot removed on my face, I might still not have gone.   In fact, I nearly canceled the appointment today because WTH...

I am mad.   I was really counting on this and I guess I should not have counted on it until the check was in hand.    I can appeal but I don't see the point. What makes me mad is that when I went to do get radiation following my chemo the local hospitals here would not give me radiation because of my stage. They said the risk wasn't worth the benefit and that my cancer was going to return anyway.   So at that time I was too terminal to get radiation and now I am not terminal enough to get my accelerated benefits.

They ordered 10 WBR treatments.  She has seen her oncolgoist today and he said the only thing they can do is the 10 radiation treatments but she has a very poor prognosis.  He advised her to go visiter her dad in Florida and get her affairs in order.   She isn't even sure she will go through the radiation at all.    Part of me wonders if they don't feel it is worth the investment trying to treat her.  She is in her early 50s and seeing a local oncologist.   She was pretty much given no opportuntity other than the radiation for any extension of life and they indicated the radiation will not really be enough to help.   This is the same group that refused to give me radiation after my lumpetomy because I was Stage IV.  They told me the benefit does outweigh the risk and that they were sure  my cancer was gong to come back anyway.    I don't know what to say to her.    I think if it were me I would be calling somewhere else in a frantic mess to live longer or at least try.   I feel like where she is getting treated is very conservative.   My heart is breaking for her and I desparately wish I could help.
