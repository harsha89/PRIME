    "Content": "Auntiemoe wrote: at least 2 months ago I first noticed some pain in my breasts while hanging onto my husband on the back of a scooter in Bermuda.  Since we got home I have found a pea size palpable mass in my right breast.  It is tender to touch. Yesterday I had a mammogram & ultrasound.  The tech could feel it, as well as the radiologist, but the could find no imaged evidence of it.  She suggested returning to my doctor to discuss the possibility of seeing a breast specialist for another opinion. I am concerned because although myself & 2 other medical professionals agree I have something there but don't seem concerned. Has anyone had the same experience?  Should I pursue this for the piece of mind that I so desperately need or give it some time? Log in to post a reply",
