Don't be scared, talk to someone now, don't wait. Its silly to have to wait a month.",

It never grew or did anything, until I hit 45. I then felt it had an edge to it...weird, so went in and sure enough, it was cancer and the tumor was described as 3.5 to 4cms. When I went to get a second opinion some three weeks later, the other hospital radioligist decided it was 7 cms? So I am not sure what size mine was, but because it was over the \"magic\" number of 5cms I was placed in a later stage which meant I got everything thrown at me. The good news is with neoadjuvant chemo my tumor shrunk to 7mm which is almost a complete response. But I wasn't happy for long.  I had a breast surgeon who ignored that and took 16cms out of my breast. And most of what she took out was not cancerous according to the pathology report, and since she is such a horrible doctor she never explained why she did what she did or GOD FORBID ASK what I wanted her to do...(I am not illiterate, she should have told me what she had found and described my options, her recommendations and allowed ME to decide what was to be done to MY body for MY LIFE! at the time of surgery.   To make matters worse, her boss, another BS said she would not have taken so much tissue.)  So the doctors are adding to the size of the actual tumor with anything that looks suspicious...just another illustration of how inaccurate and how ineffective modern medical science is. We haven't gone much further than the use of leeches in my opinion.",

Almost 6 months after chemo it is even more curly, almost 90% grey but less thick. I will say it appears much softer and healthier, but slow growing. I am averaging about a 1/4 inch or less a month, as opposed to my usual 1/2 inch. I didn't color it till about 4 months out and used Perfect 10 hair color and it was pretty close to the lightest color on the box, which I think is due to my grey hair and it not having any color on it. I am also on tamoxifen for about three months which could be the cause of the thinner hair or slow growth. Had to go off the biotin for rads (my own choice, no real reason other than wanting to make sure I didn't take anything that would impede or complicate rads)",

I wish I had your strength!  Be sure to get a second opinion from another facility. It should be covered by your insurance company. After my diagnosis at one BC center, I looked up the best rated BC center in my area, called the hospital and made an appt. Transferred all of my info there and met with a surgeon. Also, each center has their own way of handling patients. Sometimes it will be a BS and other facilities have you meet with an oncologist first, so don't let that confuse you. Some websites for general info are Susan G. Komen, Dr. Susan Love, National Cancer Institute and American Cancer Society - which will list local resources as well. I also search for clinical trials in my area.  Ask your doctor, or you can search clinicaltrials.gov/  or NCI also lists trials.  And if you are not happy with any of your doctors, if they don't provide information or involve you in your own care -- its your body and your life after all -- Find another doctor. As a friend of mine said, not all of them graduated at the top of their class :) Good luck to you and take care!",

I started rads on April 25th with 2 fields. Continued until May 16th when the superclav area was added so now have 4 fields. I have been using Miaderm 3 times a day everyday I have had radiation and make sure I have at least 8 glasses of water a day.  I also walk briskly to my hospital and walk back (thought I would use this time to start an excercise habit) its about 2 miles each way... So far only slight redness under my arm and no fatigue. I have 21 more sessions left (due to the rad onc not planning the superclav upfront -- just another screw up, so carberry I am with you on the WTHeck? doc.) That's been my journey so far...hope all of you are fairing well...And thanks for the replies!",

I am hoping for the 3 week cycle (an increased dose per day) which in a 12 year study has been said to be as effective...but my Radioligist is fighting me on it...not sure why. My nurse told me some great advice. Don't know if it works yet but thought I would pass on for those that didn't get any info: 1. The radiation slows down the maturation of new skin, so to protect that don't rub off the old skin even if it looks a bit gross. The old skin is actually protecting the new skin growing underneath 2. No deodorant with metal of any kind. Tom's of Maine and Le Crystall Roll-on along with body powder made of cornstarch and baking soda are the suggested alternatives. 3. Do not shave the underarm on the treatment side during radiation  4. Chlorine in swimming pools may irritate your skin. If you have to swim for excercise, be sure to gently wash chlorine off after swimming 5. Miaderm - 3x daily,  or Remedy Skin Repair - 2-3 times daily. Do not apply cream less than 2 hours before treatment. AND PLEASE CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THESE, your doctor may have other suggestions. 6. Don't take supplements of vitamins A, C and E. If you take a multivitamin just make sure you are only getting 100% and no more. These vitamins interfere with effectiveness of radiation. Obviously I am not a doctor and these were suggestions only, but if your doctor or nurse hasn't talked about this to you, be sure to have your doctor walk through the process with you. So onward and upward! Only 6 more weeks (or 3 -- maybe?)  YEAH!",
