My doctor sent me in for a mammogram and ultrasound, and so far they suspect that Lump is a fibroadenoma, mostly due to my age and the way it looks in the images.   Lump is tangled in a healthy (?!) blood supply and nearly 3 cm.  The doctor told me that it's likely that he's pushing on tissue, vessels and nerves, causing my discomfort.  Because of the blood supply, surgical removal was recommended for me.  A core biopsy might nick a blood vessel. Generally speaking, I don't think that pain is normally associated with cancer.  I'm hoping that is true in both our cases.  I hope you find answers at your mammogram next week.",

Odds are, Lump is just a fibroadenoma,  but I have that voice in the back of my head too...the one that insists that there's more to Lump than what meets the eye. I'm planning on having the lump removed.  Actually, that surgery was scheduled for last Tuesday, but the surgeon ended up on call and an emergency came up.  I'm still waiting to hear back on when the appointment can be rescheduled.  The procedure is considered outpatient and shouldn't slow me down for more than a couple of days.  I believe needle biopsies are more common, but in my case, they are concerned with the blood supply around the lump.  They wanted to avoid causing a hematoma.  Also, the lump is kinda big and they're worried that it might hide something behind it.  Besides the uncomfortable ache, you can clearly see my lump under the skin.  I don't know how long it has been there, but I first noticed it about a month ago. I don't mind sharing my experience, so feel free to ask questions or message.  I'll certainly try to answer them to the best of my ability, and I've been told that I'm a great listener and sounding board (if you just need to vent). :-)",

As far as the surgery goes, they're looking to reschedule for April 2nd.  My primary doctor has been great to work with and she's trying to find a way for me to get in sooner; talked to her about an hour ago.  I may be seeing another surgeon if she has anything to say about it.  To be honest, I'm not looking forward to waiting another two weeks.  Being able to see the lump seems to freak out the doctors more so than me.  \"So you have this lump, eh?  Where is...nevermind, found it!\"  I found it while getting dressed.  My hand just kinda brushed it and I was all, \"Oh, hi...  Where did you come from?\"  I can't believe that I didn't notice it sooner. Anyway, you don't sound like an idiot to me, or bananas for that matter. Only a few people close to me know about my situation.  I feel like I've been on an emotional rollercoaster, but like you said, statistics are on our side.  And you're right, waiting is exhausting!  *sigh*  I want to ditch Lump, find out exactly what he's made of and tackle the next step (whatever it might be). \"Thanks again for keeping the lines of communication open. Having a friendly person to vent to is helping more than you know. I'm here for you, too. Vent or scream or cry or laugh! I'm here.\" Ditto!  I'll certainly keep in touch.  Please let me know how things go for you on Tuesday.",
