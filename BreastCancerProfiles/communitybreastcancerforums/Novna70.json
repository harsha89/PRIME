My anxiety came from the discovery (almost by accident) of high blood sugar, and the possibility of the surgery being delayed! I was freaking out. I went into a super strict diet, medication and glucose measuring 4 times a day (don't miss that many pricks). I was in a zone! I needed the cancer out of me. Try to concentrate on something else and put your energy and/or faith on the positive result of the surgery. You will be cancer free soon! I know it's not easy and I hope you have strong support from family and friends. I wish you a speedy recovery. Godspeed!",
