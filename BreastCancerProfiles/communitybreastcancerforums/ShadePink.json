When I go out or when I want to wear a nice bra, I wear a knitted knocker, which is so light and comfy. The position I'm in now is,I chose Not to do recon,but I struggle with clothes,bras etc. I'm guessing if I wasnt uniboob self conscious, I obviously wouldnt care, but I dont even like to wear prosthetic. I'm looking into gorgeous tattoo, and not hiding prosthetic cleavage hide, and just be free. Any advice? Any of you choose tattoo or no prosthetic? Thanks, I so look forward to being here!

I am wondering though, I would like to be completely confident and free and not worry about flat side. I hate prosthetic, I now love my sports bras, gives my left breast support and lays flat on right flat side. I'm looking into a tattoo, but I'm wondering, I would just like to not care and wear my tanks etc. I just haven't gotten over that last hump of vanity yet.",
