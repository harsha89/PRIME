I spoke to 4 different doctors and 2 nurses and they all recommended me to get it. They told me that this was the only option that was left for me after chemo and surgery. ( I am triple negative) I had my 3rd treatment today and so far it hasn't been too bad. I pray that after this I can go on with my life. I am looking forward to a long and wonderful life with my husband and children.",
