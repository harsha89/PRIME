I'm now Day 4 from first TC treatment. While certainly not feeling good, it's not nearly as bad as I'd anticipated. The Zofran is the key, certainly for me anyway, as well as the Claritin which seems to be helping with joint pain from Neulasta. You may want to check with your doc about Xanax or Adavan to take the morning before your first treatment to help with anxiety. Best wishes.",

I did end up taking the anti-nausea for 2 extra days. Fifteen days out, I'm still having intermittent joint pain, depending what I do the day before (I think?) and feeling very fatigued today. My MO stressed hand-washing, but she did not say to become a shut-in; I am a little worried about the flu that is going around though. The infusion center gave me info that said the \"nadir\" (lowest point) for the wbc count varies for each chemo drugs: Taxotere=5-9 days, Cytoxan=10-14. Recovery for both at 21 days, but then of course if you're on the every 3-week protocol like me, we'll be hit with the next treatment! My next treatment is Friday the 26th, and I'm dreading it. I'm thinking of all of you, everyone hang in there!",

I do not have a port, all through IV, they gave me oral anti-nausea and benedryl with a 15 minute IV push of steroids, followed by 1 hour Taxotere, 1/2 hour of Cytoxan. I'm feeling off today -- tired, no appetite, sore mouth, retaining water, puffy -- but not nauseous as I started the Zofran last night to head it off, and am soup, tea and toast. Mouth rinses for the soreness. My doc said take Zofran as needed, but I'm going to take it every 8 hours regardless. Days 3-5 may be the worst, and hair shedding supposedly starts around day 21. My Neulasta pack should go off tonight at 6, and I'll take Claritin for that. I am doing the cold capping, and honestly, that was the most uncomfortable part of the whole process. We did have a nurse who works for the company (Arctic Cold Caps) who brought all of the supplies, and taught my sister & bff how to manage the process. The caps lengthened the day considerably; they have to be worn for four hours following the finish of the entire chemo infusion. She followed us back to my house for the balance of the hours. Wishing everyone going through this scary process strength and good health. I am envisioning having drinks on the beach with my family the end of the summer!",

It's not enough to be going through all of this, to add more things to worry about, I agree your doctor could have gotten you in for testing more quickly. I am thinking of you. @SarahSC - It's nice that you've found this group; it must be hard for you to be away from family. I'd encourage you to reach out to people near you anyway. I delayed telling friends & neighbors about my cancer dx because I tend to be a more private person, but once I did people near and far have been so supportive and lovely, it is the silver lining during this whole mess. Anyone else deal with a breast infection during chemo? My right breast reconstruction was 12/6, recovery was complication-free. First chemo 1/5; I was feeling better last week, until Friday, then in the ER for hours yesterday because of painful, swollen, red & warm to touch breast. They gave me antibiotics, and I have call into MO to see what's next. Aside from worrying about the breast itself, my main concern is this will delay the chemo schedule. Any one have similar issue?",

I guess since I'm fever-free, on antibiotics and white cell count wasn't in the toilet we're moving forward, which is what I prefer. I have to say, you're so brave, I admire that you're embracing the bald! I really don't think I could pull it off, for multiple reasons. Are you ready for round 2? @Smickeyrn--regarding your Neulasta bone pain, did they tell you about Claritin? I took it for 5 days following the automatic injection, it seemed to help. @Worriedme77--am thinking of you today, I hope you got some good news. Hang in there All--xoxo ",

One little tidbit for you I heard from the nurses at the infusion center, they said Thursdays are their busiest days there; timing-wise it allows for a person's worst days to fall over the weekend, so people could potentially return to work on Mondays. I wonder if you have a sympathetic boss, and/or good HR department that could guide you, as you will definitely need some time off. My very best wishes to you. Is ANYONE else having trouble sleeping? I am one full week post first TC treatment, and having the worst time sleeping. I'm off all meds (other than Motrin) right now, and most of the Nuelasta pain has subsided. I am so tired but true, deep and restful sleep is eluding me. Any tips?",

I am losing hair but slowly, probably because of the cold caps. @Char105 -- I'm equally frustrated by the inability to sleep well! It was one thing I did not realize would be an issue during chemo. I'm wondering how much has to do with the drugs, and how much is the fear that can strike when you wake up in the middle of the night and can't turn the brain off. I'd really prefer to be comatose. I want to find out from MO what can be done to fix this. Here we go, round 2 tomorrow....I am armed and ready with my morning Lorazepam. Fingers crossed to avoid some NEW fresh hell of SE.
