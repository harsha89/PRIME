We have been genetically tested and negative. Of course there is a link but is yet to be discovered. I don't worry too much about what caused the cancer because it doesn't matter any more. Even slender women who have children in their twenties and breastfeed can get it. My desire is to push past it and hope something is discovered in time to help our daughters.",

I don't come on the boards or post as much as I used to because I am trying to move past cancer and treatment and just trying to have my normal life. Three years ago I started chemo and had 15 total months of treatment and thought it would never end. And then it does. I was able to work throughout. Some don't. You're in the hard part. It will pass. Wishing you all gentle treatment. Life is really ok again despite my early fears",

There are other reasons too such as age and agressivenesses of the cancer. I followed my doctors recommendations. I am three years out and so far so good!",
