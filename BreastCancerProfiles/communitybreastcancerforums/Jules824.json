I have a quesion? Does anyone feel the rads hitting them? This is the 3rd time I feel like little shocks (nothing major). But they say thats impossible. The techs look at me like Im crazy. But I even closed my eyes so I wouldnt know when the radiation was hitting me. and well I feel it, Im not imagining! Also in case you need to know.... I found the deoderant Toms of Maine at CVS for 5.99. My rads team still didnt tell me about deoderant so I just bought it by what I read on here. Still no cream either from the rad team. They say they will watch me for burns, then give cream. No burns yet but its my 2nd week. Im getting tired of going to the hospital daily already (the traffic is horendous and people drive terrible IE 80 MPH in a 55 zone!). Tonight they are calling for ice. The traveling and weather is stressing me more than the rads machine. I am starting to have actual panic attacks. Take care for now and keep the faith gang!",

My husband is getting the regular flu shot next week. He should have the H1N! too, because hes asthmatic but no dice so far. I never get the flu shot at all because I spend most of the winter in the house w my back issues, but now I am wondering should I get the regular one (and H1N1 if it becomes available) because Im spending time at the hospital around germs. My treatment center didnt say anything about it. Today all the cancer patients got handmade Christmas shawls people croched. Im not into shawls but it can be doubled as a winter scarf. Anyway I appreciate the kindness put into them! I am at 13 rads out of 28 right now. I am feeling hoarse (voiced), and very tired. Maybe Im coming down with something, who knows? Well its 11 PM, Im off to bed, I can barely stay awake again. I used to stay up sooo late, but not anymore. I guess I have to come on and post earlier! ((hugs)) Jules",

Also can anyone recommend a good book on tips for foods and just ways to try to keep healthier so this doesnt come back? (will we ever know why in the first place?) I did start eating healthier but I want to do more. I have alot of trouble excercising due to my other health issues so just am wondering what I can try to do from here on in.

My cousin who helped me thru my stuff has had a reoccurance of cancer after being clear 2 years. It really got to me. Shes 45. I just got so upset and dont feel like posting much but I AM praying for you all every day. But.... I just wanted to check in and tell you and try to help all of who I can..I saw Dr Oz do a show on poisons in food. He said go for young fish (due to mercury in older fish). Salmon tested lowest while Albacore tuna tested highest for mercury even though its good tasting, albacore is older thus more mercury. Next, eat fresh or frozan veggies not canned because canned have plastic linings inside that are poison to us. Try to look for organic veggies of course, IE they have no pesticides. Lastly (and my dad has stayed away from this for years and evidently is right). Check plastic jugs. \"To be safe they should have a triangle on the bottom with a 7 in the middle of the triangle\". If not the \"toxins\" in those other plastic jugs without the triangle 7 on the bottom are known to cause breast cancer, prostate cancer etc. ANd never microwave in plastic. Another words plastic containers are no good for us unless the above kind. I realize this can sound a bit paranoid and how far must we go? But I believe Dr Oz's show is right and I am going to try to stay away from all of the above and listen. Somanywomen. I am glad for the book and am following it by doing what it says. Thanks again so much for the recommendation. Take care gang, and keep the faith. ((HUGS TO ALL)) Jules",

I guess I have to buy some games you play while sitting! My husband got me a Kindle and a 50 dollar gift card to buy books for it! YAY! My daughter & her family got me a sweater, a laptop bag and stand for the laptop, and earphones for my Ipod. (I am a techie girl). Take care everyone and again Merry Christmas! Jules",

Whats been going on----Things were going well, house was being remodled by my husband. I was getting out and about.. And then it hit.... My husband was taken to the hospital and admitted when he couldnt breath (allergic reaction  to over the counter headache pills). Now undergoing heart tests cause they found something while he was in the hospital. (I doubt he has heart problems, hes a fit as a fiddle IMO but will see and Im praying to God hes OK). And me, Im headed for neurosurgery consultations (that were put off during breast cancer). Because. my back went out just from turning wrong. Its been a hell of a time and the pain  been so bad I sit and cry and my nerves are shot. My poor husband dresses me (my pants) and gets my meals. Hes an ANGEL but i feel so bad cause hes going thru stuff too and I feel like a burden. During this was in the ER twice, (my old meds no longer worked for the pain).At the ER I had morphine shot, steroid shot, anti infllammatory shot, and was on steroids (orally) and now on oxycodone. I havent slept in our bed since ? and only get 2 hrs or so sleep a night on a recliner. The oxy is making me high as a kite and sick too and they want me to mix it with other stuff, well Im not mixing drugs so I take 2 oxy a day and suffer in between. I am very upset and scared of contimplating back surgery for fear of ending up in a wheel chair. And, I am so TIRED beyond belief. I see the surgeon and my pain team this week. They better do something. Ive had it. Sorry for all the whinning.. JUst wanted to fill you in and mostly let you know I AM thinking of all of you!!!!! Take care ((hugs)) I gotta go, Jules",

Then I think of Ghostbusters when the green rads (lasar?) light lights. Have to try to keep a sense of humor. So I thought of my kids and those movies to clear my mind.lol. So anyway, I had 2 rads sessions so far. (I am supposed to get 28 total). The techs are all nice. Will see the doc tomorrow after my 3rd session. Everything is ok so far, but its early yet of course. I am fair skinned so I expect to burn. But mostly I am worried about my lung that they said will be exposed (partially). Lastly... I asked about creams because I heard we should put them on ahead of time before we may burn but they said no, they will keep watch and if I need something then they will give it. I also asked about deoderant because I read on here no deoderants. They didnt really answer much, so I will use cornstarch (again read about on here).  The only complaints I have are,(I can relate to Jayne!) the traffic going over is nerve racking! And....the other complaint I have is,.I find more out on here than from the doc so far! Yes it is early to get up each day (Mimi). Maybe going to bed earlier at night may work? I was used to staying up till 1 or 2 am and sleeping in (till now.lol).. (I dont work but my husband works nights so we used to stay up late) Take care for now and keep the faith!

Dont let them dismiss any side effects you may have! On the male thing, I have a male tech guy. I wasnt thrilled at first, but now I am used to him.

I was very upset when finding out about this and surgery day I was a complete mess. It is totally understandable. I was wondering what general area in PA you are from if you dont mnd me asking. (I am from PA too) The reason I ask is, my doctors said the radiation is the easy part so that rang a bell with me. As far as rads,. I am tired in the evening, and burning a bit but the main things that annoy me are the daily trip and the rads doctor. The machine itself is scarey but you feel nothing and its quick. Well please keep us posted on how you are doing. I hope everything goes smoothly for you. Mimi Im so sorry you were not happy with the tv. I can understand that. Well just so hes a nice guy and not mean. Some men arent good gift givers. This year I got the Kindle yes, but sometimes my husband buys stuff he likes too. lol..Last year I got an LCD tv but I did wish for one because our old giant screen broke and we were using a portable, and believe it or not I watch tv more than him. But he doesnt send flowers and stuff anymore like the dating days, but hes still a good guy and has stuck by me thru all my health issues even before we got married. So thats all that matters is how men treat you. Somanywomen, Im glad you had a nice holiday. Sounds like you have a great husband. That is so romantic a card every Friday! I had a friend who I now lost contact with, but her husband used to send her flowers every week. I often wonder if he still does it because this was long long ago after they first got married.

I am now looking forward to weekends because no treatments on weekends. Yay! lol.. Torono I didnt know about the wine but Im on sooo many back meds (I have a bad back too) I cant drink (unfortunately). Diane- I didnt get a choice of treatment. They told me 28 treatments (3 at the end will be boosts) and they said the radiation amount (20 something? I forget) is the same for all. Yes Mimi I get weighed too (weekly) before I see the rads doc. They said I must see the rads doc once a week thus the weigh in at that time. If anyone knows, did your docs tell you NO vitamins during treatment? My doc said none, no vitamins so I am trying to eat healthy and I am drinking anti-oxident fruit type smoothies I buy in the organic section of the grocery store.",

I think some schools here had the nasal one for the kids but thats it so far. Thanks for the well wishes. I have a sore throat now, and am hoarse (on and off). Not so tired today yet, (it usually hits me at night). After rads I was nauseated, but ate early lunch (even though I had breakfast hours before..lol..) and the nausea cleared up after I ate. So anyway, I must be getting a cold. I hope thats it. I saw my pain team after rads today. Now I need a hip MRI after rads is overwith, because my hips bad in addition to my back (grrrr).

Jayne, thanks for the update. I am glad you are doing well now and I hope your redness continues to clear up.  I met the new rads doc today who is very nice and much more thorough. I have to drink alot of water cause Im dehydrating. The nausea and sick stomach is from ulcers so now I have stomach ulcer meds. In addition I had to get some hydrocortisone cream instead of the Aquafor because they said the Aquafor is too much like vaseline. Lastly I have to have 4 boosts in addition to my 28 because of the comedo type cancer. So I have to do what I have to do. Had a very stressful day today. Couldnt get ahold of my dad for a day and a half (hes 83). So we went by after rads and had to charge in (he didnt answer the door). He messed up the answering machine and couldnt hear my calls. I was a nervous wreck but thank God he was ok. (he should not be living alone in my opinion, and thats an ongoing argument w my brother and a whole nother story).

Thanks for the info on deoderant Linda. I will look for that kind. In the meantime I bought corn starch..lol. I think I smell but my husband and the techs said no. Maybe its in my head cause I knew I didnt have deoderant on? I had to skip rads today. The doc was only in this afternoon so the techs said they cant do it in the morning today. I cant go afternoons. So anyway I will be back at it tomorrow again. I did meet another rads doc (a man) who I like much better than the original rads doc. This guy was honest and told me side effects.

I saw my back pain team last week, went to the regular doc today for blood pressure check, cholesterol check etc. Back to the same grind. Take care everyone and hang in there, Jules",
