I am still awaiting a bone scan, (the machine broke on my appointment day) and I get the second drain taken out tomorrow. I am 21 days post-op rt mastectomy as of today and so the Oncologist wants to give me nearly three weeks to heal from surgery and drain removal. He told me he is about to drop my white count to my boots and remove all my hair. THEN when I am feeling better sometime in March or so I can start radiation therapy. I am what I now know is a \"triple negative\" (i'm learnin the lingo) so after all of that \"stuff\", I just have to wait and see if it is going to come back. I see a lot of you are starting mid month - Light and healing thoughts your way that we can all get the oomph to get through well and safely! THanks too to those of you posting in the cheerleading section... It's nice to know so many people have seen the other side of this and can even help others through. Karyll",

I really wanted a Partridge Family lunchbox/binder/pack though. David Cassidy was my hero and Bobby Sherman was ON that show. I loved the coke commercials = \"It's the REal Thing\" and Melanie :I gotta brand new pair of roller skates, you gotta brand new key\" AND I sold all my barbies (house furniture, clothes) to buy a brand new ten speed bike! That was exciting. I am on day 8 post chemo. I feel pretty good, but sleep was just not forthcoming last night even with mega drugs. ThanksGiving in Canada this weekend so got a check list of all that is going on there tomake and plan and putter about. I AM in SLO MO. I'll probably try and nod off a couple of hours this morning.

      "Content": "Oct 9, 2007 08:52AM - edited Oct 9, 2007 08:52AM by Karyll My tx is different than you guys but the nurses load me up with zofran pre chemo and lots of pre hydration. Drink water water water she told me, two days before so I slosh when I get there and then keep drinking for two more days close to a gallon a day. She felt that minimizes the dehydrating effect of the chemo, helps flush it all out and stops nausea. The meds they give me make me so thirsty that it's not at all hard to do. Then she hangs a mini bag of dexamethasone prior to the IV push of 5FU, and Epirubicin. Lastly with another bag of Saline, she hangs the Cyclophosphamide. They send me home with oral dexamethasone and zofran to take twice a day whether I think I need it or not. And breakthrough, metoclopramide and gravol (your dramamine?) for nausea. Also a very good supply of ativan. With the back pain I am also taking pain medication - so hard on the guts- I had to buy one of those little weekly pill boxes because I was getting everything mixed up with everything... lol Then I just carry the little compartment around with me all day. I have also been taking some Vitamin C and a good multi mineral in between treatmets. I don't take them the 4 days I am on the steroids - don't ask me why, just seems like too much I guess *rolls eyes* What I will do differently is take the stool softener the day of and not wait two days, and will request something for the massive heartburn and acid reflux and have something very bland on my stomach so as not to let that stuff start churning acid up. Have a great day/week everyone. Karyll PS - been thinking about the emotions - could be \"chemo pause\" as well. Don't beat yourself up, your hormones have a mind of their own right now and they don't what the hell they are doing either.",

That is providing of course that the drainage is clear, your whites aren't red and you don't have any greeny ickey stuff included with itching.

Day 15, I hugged one of the little ladies I look after and nearly left her with a fur coat on her sweater. My scalp had been extremely tender for those two days and on Day 16, I had a friend give me a buzz cut. The relief was tremendous. I have heard many say the same thing, so my guess is - if it is not hurting you may be able to wait it out. The oncology nurse told me my next tx (starting taxotere) will knock every hair out that is left on my body - which isn't very much at all.  I am pre-menopausal as well. I had my period every two weeks during the first three treatments and now I have been 5 weeks without. (I was always sooo regular). The oncology nurse, also said that I would be thrown into \"chemopause\" and probably stay that way given my age (47) following treatment. That in it's way would be a blessing. However, this last week I have been suffering from mega hot flashes. She said I might experience 3 years worth of hotflashes in 9 weeks. Fun Fun Fun.... ya just never know eh? Karyll",

I know when I am feeling like crap - I come here to find someone to encourage if I can or to share the little I know and my experience with someone who might be as scared or more scared than I was. If I am low, I am quite sure there is someone here who is also low (I don't mean just this thread, but all over the boards) but there might be someone who can make me feel a little lighter. Sometimes, that is by looking at someone who is scared because they are waiting test results, or surgery - hey... we've been there done that, got the t shirt and everything - so I try to remember how I felt then (it's not that long ago) and can empathize exactly with that person - I can tell them it wasn't as bad as I imagined (true) and I can tell them that the waiting is the hardest part of it all (true) and that even if the diagnosis is yucky, you put one foot in front of the other and take it day by day and you get through(also true). THAT is the part that reminds me... today is just that.. A DAY... and I will get through this too. I am not saying that everyone should do that lol, or think that, but I know when blue, angry, sad, happy, relieved - it always.. and I can say ALWAYS makes me feel better to come to these boards to help me get throug- h THAT day. So TriGeek, if there is an inkling of hope that you could feel better, come here -vent, share, get it off your chest, out of your heart, and off your shoulders - We will take it for you - and hold that misery out of your way until you can discard it, or want it back (ewwwww).   I know, I know it sounds kind of silly to some but seriously - if you can package it up in your mind, into one portion of your day or your life and kick it to the curb even on the short term - it surely helps.  Not to mention of course all the love and support one receives from this thread alone. SO I thank you all because today has been one full of anxiety for me - and I got to type it out, read how you all are, and be grateful for knowing you because you have beentheredonethat gotthetshirt and know exactly how \"I\" feel today for today.

I toddled off to my blood work and it came back fine, except my liver tests are all out of whack. I did not have the thought process to ask what that REALLY meant on the phone.. but soon as I got off the phone, the mets question really hit me. So I see onc on Tuesday to find out more I guess.

It's like grab a cracker, grab the water bottle, try to chew without moving, get one cracker down, drink water, take a pill or (ten) eat a cracker drink some water and just lie there for about half an hour. Then I can get up and get going on some things. Today is turkey day, so i am letting the pills work now as i sit and wait to get going on all the fixings for the day. Nice cup of tea (why have I gone off coffee?) and typing. What could be better... lol. Back to work for me on Tuesday, I Am going to have to set my clock an hour earlier just to get UP, then I still have a couple of weeks of work before next tx. I will cross my fingers that I follow this \"pattern\" where day 4 and 5 post chemo are \"Do not pass Go, Do not Collect 200 dollars and Do not plan on being up more than a few hours\" so that I can continue with my full time job at least 90% of it. But I do have some vacation if I have to use it. That'll go down in the books - So Karyll, how was your vacation? Are you going away this year? (I travel every year usually), I'll just say yup, all the way to the cancer clinic, the pharmacy, my bed and my bathroom!!! Woohooo. Just think this time next year, I might be taking a REAL holiday. Have a great day everyone! Karyll",

I would imagine (and I am only guessing) that it has to do with the extreme fatigue that hits. Even if you are working FT or working in the house - every little bit takes every little bit out of you. Even if I am not feeling it at the time, I know when it's bed time that all I want is SLEEP so that I can function through the next day. I am certainly no expert but I think there are some good articles around here.

It is relatively new - we don't share a home but I was diagnosed 3 months after we met. I didn't think he would stick around, I gave him the option not to. He said, I need to deal with this in my own way - I can't handle your problems. I was terribly hurt because I didn't understand that he was hurting and fearful himself and did not wish to burden me with even more than I was dealing with. He has since explained this to me - because he became distant and I thought for sure he was just trying to \"let me down slowly\". In actuality, in a strange sort of way, he thought he was protecting me -by not adding to the stress. It makes sense sort of - and we are still together in our way. We see eachother every weekend - a bit leery of the cohabitating due to both our previous experiences (and his kids are a lot to handle right now) but I just wanted to say that the \"withdrawal\" seems to be a common thing, perhaps a male way of dealing with their own pain (it's gotta hurt if they care) and fear (I don't want to lose you) and the male I can't FIX this syndrome. I wanted to talk ( you can tell I like to talk) - He wanted to seemingly ignore the whole thing. It's weird really but ya know? They are still there - When he said on one of my chemo days - Thursday not the weekend - I think I should come and stay with you early this week - I suddenly realized that he IS still here, and is actually here more in his heart than he would like to be.(sometimes) He just doesn't deal well, and doesn't want to compound things FOR me because he knows he can't do anything to make it all go away. His distance has afforded me strength - because I had to - and then his kindness and gentle approach made me realize he was hurting with all of this too. We are both capricorns and both very alike in certain things (except the Venus and Mars thing) and as irrelevant as that may seem at the moment - I realized that we both internalize, we both deal with things very similarly, and it gave me an insight into why he seemed distant when he was merely \"coping\". I dunno if any of this makes sense, it just suddenly gave me a wash of clarity into at least part of the male psyche and a reminder that they are \"fixers\" and feel utterly helpless in this situation and that can't do much for their ego either....... Karyll PS - insight and understanding does NOT stop me from snapping or biting his head off sometimes though - poor guy and yet he returns every weekend, probably really not having a clue which Karyll will be here THIS time... lol",

I am having FEC (canadian version of AC I think) every three weeks x4 and then into Taxotere  x4 every three weeks.   I just had chemo #2 and am doing okay. I had it on Thursday and on days 5 and 6I am a wet noodle. But today, Day 7 I am quite functional again although weary. Chemo #3 sounds like a nightmare for everyone. I have two more weeks to go for that one. I will finish the FEC mix on December 20th if all goes as planned... Merry Christmas sheesh... day 5 and 6 fall on those days. It will be a very quiet year this year.     I take all the drugs they will give me.. LOL... Zofran, steroids, ativan - sleeping pills. I have to work FT through this so need to stay pretty stable and functional. Nausea is minimal for me..(touch wood) Constipation is unbearable - and I had no heartburn this time because he gave me a drug called pantaloc. Taste??? WHAT THE HECK IS TASTE? Everything tastes like cardboard and aspartame.. yet again. Very weird. Gatorade tastes Right and that may be the ONLY thing that does at this point. My kids think it is great that we have a steady store of gatorade... lol...well? it works. This taste thing started on Sunday three days after chemo, so I am timing it this time to KNOW when something might taste good again. I know it comes back, because things tasted fine last week pre chemo.   My eyelashes have started falling, and I learned this because of my eyes gumming up in the morning. The cancer nurse explained that because they are falling out slowly, I may not notice but my eyes know.. and so they start making more tears to wash out what the eyelashes used to keep out. COOL EH?...I am fascinated with this, and wrote on a few threads about it, sorry if you are reading me double... hehehehe.... Anyway, Good luck with all of you as you go through this week and this treatment. I don't like the dose dense things I have been reading from all of you. Quicker, more effective? I don't know - maybe, who really does know but you are all really suffering a lot more side effects to a higher degree. Blessings to us all - the strength is in there - you all have proved it!!!!

I am a little anxious with what I have read about the Taxotere and neuropathy's and neupogen or whatever shots that I can't afford...But hey, I guess I got to here, I can get to there somehow. I am still working FT and I don't want to lose that momentum especially at year end. The nurse did tell me that the taxotere would probably throw me into menopause and strip every last hair I have on my body - Well the only place it is stuck, is on my legs... and weirdly enough, I have not lost my eyebrows. We are doing well ladies, I love your stories and your pictures. I am so glad to have been here (well you know what I mean). Blessings Karyll",

I had a right mastectomy August 21st, and so chemo is starting 5 weeks later. I too, am having a muga scan as well as an adrenal CT (tomorrow)because my original CT showed something on my adrenal gland. Neither the surgeon or Oncologist thought it was related, but wanted to have more follow up \"in case\". Oh I have learned to hate those words. I had 12/14 nodes positive plus 3 sentinal nodes positive. My tumor was 3.5 cm and so far we haven't found anything that is definitive for mets. My bone scan came clear but along with a nagging back ache, I ended up in Emergency via ambulance with bizarre immobilizing back spasms. ER doc didn't know anything, couldn't tell, suggested more tests.. *sigh*..and gave me some muscle relaxants, anti inflammatories and tylenol 3's.  So I probably won't see another doc until Thursday unless I end up in the ER again. He told me that I should not consider every physical event a cancer event, it may be totally unrelated. Either way it is still freaky. So I'll check here, and on Sept. thread for awhile. Good luck everyone with their first tx. and I will be sure to let you know how mine went too. Karyll",

This third one seems to have kicked my butt a bit more, as I am usually on the upswing by this day. However, I slept 12 hours last night and shooting for about ten tonight. My work at work is piling up and I have to find a way to keep up with that even though I have brain lint (I love that phrase, hope you don't mind me using it) I went to look good feel better today put on by the canadian cancer society, and although I wished I DID feel better today (kick ass fatigue) it was a worthwhile endeavor. However - never having to do anything with my eyebrows before ( they were pure, unplucked, and symmetrical) I have an interesting kind of KOJAK appearance with the eyebrows they helped me put on. I have a moonie face from the steroids, and I feel a bit like the buddha face so many have spoken about. I have a staff Christmas Party on the 7th of December and although that will be only a week past my first Taxotere, I am hoping to be able to attend at least the supper portion. My boyfriend ( of 9 months) has had a tough time falling in love with a woman with breast cancer diagnosis after knowing one another for only 3 months - but appears to be hanging in there. \"Sick\" is not his thing so I keep most of that part away from him but there are certain restrictions on my \"down days\" and I think he may be feeling that at times.(like I can't make him tea, or ask him to get me something and I can't drive for the shakes sometimes) I give him credit for sticking it out with me though - we are making a website together, hopefully to get us both an independent stream of income and I knew he loved me when he requested that I make sure there is a beautiful pink ribbon on the site to indicate that I am a survivor and a fighter and he even used the word dynamic. I am in looooooooveeeee. Anyway, he will come to my CHristmas Party with me too. I am blessed in so many ways and right now, in this fatigue state it is only making me very very weepy. This may be the first \"blue\" day that I haven't been able to shake off very well. NOt bad for 9 weeks of chemo and a mastectomy. I guess I will forgive myself for not \"faking it till I make it\" today. Reading about all of you and trials and tribulations, is uplifting, and also in some cases heartbreaking. Strength and courage to us all ladies - We can do this and we can do it with class..... My S/E have been very low. I am indeed blessed and enriched by all of you. Forward -----> Blessings Karyll",

I have no arm hair though, no nasal hairs, no lashes, no brows, very little pubic hair ( I can't tell too much without using a mirrror - tummies are good for one thing at least) so I don't know if braiding is an option with whats left and I have little whiskers (as I said above) on my head. I razored it awhile ago and was smooth like a babies butt but the bristles are there now - only to be falling out again... sheeesh...Did any of you ever imagine you would be reading about someone's body hair with interest?

SO this if you think you are getting something you start taking it right away - before you get real symptoms, so even after an exposure - and then you can take a certain amount through the illness IF you get sick (so far it has worked for me) and then sort of a maintenance dose if you want to, through cold season. I was feeling a bit \"snotty\" this morning, so starting taking some after your jog my chemo brain reminder. So all of that explanation to say... WHat's Airborne? LOL Karyll",

So here we go again, Blood work tomorrow (I have a cold sore, I hope that is not indicative of anything) and then Thursday I have a breakfast meeting in the morning so not going in to work at all - chemo is at 12:30 on Thursday. Best wishes for chemo today. Best wishes for everyone. I have to agree Ulla, the hair coming off was a blessed relief for this sore old scalp. I still have not \"bared my head\" except in private settings so hats off to you...(no pun intended). I would imagine that people didn't ask, or say anything because of a couple of reasons. 1) they respect you and your privacy 2) they did not want to say the wrong thing, and so chose to say nothing. 3)it brought them into their own thoughts about mortality Some may wait for a private moment to speak to you or ask you how you are. Anger is a normal part of this - I have moments when I could just spit with this seething sort of venom that just wants to get out. I find it much worse when my cycle is due - so heck, menopause but not quite, hormonal changes from surgery and from chemo, this disease sucks, chemo sucks, and suddenly life as you knew it has changed dramatically -hopes and dreams change from \"one day\" to will I have a one day? No wonder we get angry - unfortunately, I tend to take it out on those who least deserve it if you know what I mean and although I try hard to NOT do that, I do find myself making apologies more often that I should. SO my resolution this week, is if I feel bit*hy, I will try and stay out of everyone's way and do that, keep to myself thing as much as possible. Safe journies everyone! See you all soon.

I have had excruciating foot pain the first few days after treatment, and the docs gave me pain meds that took the edge off. Mostly now they are sensitive in my toes and my nails are becoming discolored. I did phone the cancer clinic and tell them and they were concerned and so my dose tomorrow is to be reduced. (Can you say Karyll is terrified even on the lower dose) My feet have been sore and achy especially if I have been walking a lot, and they are puffy by the end of the night for 3 weeks. Today I took the first doses of Dexamethasone (steroid) in prep for bloodwork tomorrow am, work meeting,(they will be in shock when they see me)  followed by afternoon Taxotere and I have little sausages for toes, and fat feet that I am not sure how I will get my shoes on tomorrow. Blessedly my hands have been fine. However, I have also developed some orbital edema in that my eyes are so swollen and puffy you could pack a suitcase in those bags and that has just been getting worse over the last three weeks.  So tomorrow, I am hoping to see the Doc so he can look at all this swelling, and give me something for it, explain that the foot pain is temporary, give me a certificate so that I can get paid at least a little from the gov't for medical leave, and then maybe, so long as I am wishing... he can shake me awake and tell me this is all just a bad dream. Har De Har Har.   Ulla - I feel for you and with you. I rarely look in the mirror anymore and yesterday when the boyfriend came in - I thought OMG - he obviously does not love me for my looks. I have never been one of the pretty girls... lol.. but I have always had a great smile and I kinda hope that covers me because I try to smile through it all, and it helps convince me that the light at the end of this tunnel is something to smile about. Find your smile Ulla.. Fake it till ya Make it.. everyone feels ugly at some time, even those beautiful models... It too shall pass and you will have a glow... (nooo not from the radiation beams alone)... but because you have won and conquered this challenge we are all facing so strongly together. You will see the strength inside that you had to call on, to get through it. I know I will and although I am fearful, depressed, distressed, feeling gross, ugly, weak, tired, bitchy, hormonal, fed up, angry and most recently basically unemployed - I am searching (some times really deep) for the positive aspects of all of this - not to be a hero, not to be courageous - but to just grin and bare it and get through, minute by minute some days when I am up to \"HERE\" with this bullshit.   So *true confessions* I laugh a lot, it's genuine, it's just me and who I am inside. I try to find that light above the pit I spiral into periodically and claw my way to the top. Its just me and who I am inside. That leads me to believe that I can get through this because I have the strength and it is just me and who I am inside that lets me do that.   Ooops, I seemed to have ranted........ Blessings to all of you - I am grateful and thankful to know you and hey, thats because thats just me, and who I am inside too... Ain't life grand. Happy holiday week....

We are not our bodies, our shells -  but our hearts and souls and spirits. That is where the love comes from - within. Certainly an initial attraction may be first one of physical mutual attraction but it is the insides that keep it going beyond bad hair days, sneezing, the flu, farting, dirty socks, and other more serious health issues.  A relationship is built on the \"whole\" not just one part. And the sex thing.. LOL.. my poor boyfriend - as you know it is newly developed and we should really be in the honeymoon stage but I tell ya, with teenage kids around all the time, I am either full of chemical toxins that i couldn't share, or aching all over, or have this mouth full of fuzz and on the one or two days every three weeks I MIGHT be interested to try out this free brazilian, he either has a back ache, or hasn't slept and is beat or is at home with his kids, or my kids are prowling around.. LOL but he still keeps coming around, and it ain't my sexy bald head with peach fuzz, or my lack of eyebrows, or even my intimate complaints of constipation and heavy sighs of exhaustion that keeps him coming back - its' gotta be something else that shines from within because right now.. withOUT sucks... lol.. no pun intended.   Wouldn't it be nice sometimes if we could see ourselves as others see us.... I had that experience on earth once, I swear I met my soulmate in person... We are friends, each with different lives and chatted online for ten years before actually getting together for coffee. Now I am no beauty queen, and I have never really worried about my appearance or weight once I got past teenaged angst - but what I saw in his eyes when we finally did meet was a reflection of how he saw me from the INSIDE. And that was a changing point in my life a year ago November. Even before the cancer I knew what he saw was courage, strength and a deep abiding love for all who are willing to accept it. I don't hesitate anymore, expressing love, because I had the most amazing experience of seeing how I was seen and that \"me\" was exploding with love that needs to get out. (I don't mean sexual, or romantic) just spiritual, deep soul love. IT is within all of us - and this is a case of the more love you give unconditionally, the more that comes back to you. I am well loved (I just didn't know it for a long time) and when I stopped being afraid of expressing the love I feel with no consideration of it being returned, or care if it is - I started to see the love that was being given to me just as unconditionally. SO all this new age, voodoo hoodoo spirituality is to say... no matter HOW crappy you feel... give love, express that love and you will feel it within yourself more than you could ever imagine. Allowing yourself to love yourself as well, no matter what flaws, skeletons (I have some nasties), forgive yourself for them, love yourself for them, and then tell someone that you love, that you do. DO not wait for a reply, just love them unconditionally with no expectations. It's free. Its' freeing. And it gets you through those ugly days when you don't like yourself very much because inherently you LOVE yourself and therefore have even more love to give! What goes around comes around, sometimes you just have to be the one to start the circle.    And just while I am here feeling all of this, (no it is not the drugs) Let me tell you ladies how much you have all enriched my life... the good, the bad, the ugly, the laughter, ALL of IT. I mean where else can I spout out about love, and ugly, and brazilians, and boobless things without going up to strangers in the street. I feel like we are not strangers, we have bonded through illness in a way that no one else can understand. We are in a way the elite - because we KNOW. And we can learn, and grow even in this seemingly heartless process. SO from my heart to yours - all of you! I send you love, warmth, peace and energy.

However, there really is this friar tuck thing happening at the back there... lol...Its much thicker (read more than ten hairs) right along that nape of my skull there. No curls or texture, but white fine ducky down mostly. Some color in the middle like a black streak (reverse skunk look).   Ahhh well, I have been struggling to find some good things rather than being triumphant only about being able to get up off the toilet... (which was my daily challenge last week)..... Today, I walked without staggering and am sitting up longer. Phew, when they said fatigue they meant it. I have never been such a weak kitten. The forced medical leave came just in time! Everything for a reason after all!!!!!!! Karyll",

I worked all w/end and Monday, took Tuesday and Wed off and was at work ten hours today. To say I am beat.. WELL.. yes.   I want to share a very interesting phenomenon that for some reason has totally amazed me about our bodies. Maybe I am obsessing... lol.  My hair started falling out day 14 after chemo, buzzed head day 16. I still have what I call whisker burn hair on my scalp, and some of my other body hair is coming out slowly and surely. On Tuesday I woke up with gummy sticky eyes and thought OH OH.. please, not an INFECTION!!!!!! we know what that word can mean to chemo girls....but I noticed the color and checked my eyes out and no further incident. Wednesday AGAIN gummy eyes. I phoned the cancer clinic (like they tell ya too if you are worried) and described my eye goo to her (not green, no obvious visible drainage, just glued shut in the a.m.) The wonderful nurse there explained to me, that although I may not notice it, my eyelashes are slowly falling out too. (I knew this would happen, so no surprise) BUT to make up for that, our eyes make more tears to protect the eye, washing out what the eyelashes would most normally keep out. Now maybe I am strange but I was very excited about how amazing and resilient and adaptive our bodies are to find a way to combat this. SO today guess what? Drippy nose. YOU GOT IT.. my nose hairs are all gone too!!!!!!!!!    I can't remember who said it about going back to work (forgive me, I just read about three pages of posts)... I have involved all of my coworkers in the saga - even the men because they have or may have female counterparts. YES when I came to work after mastectomy, they all looked... trying not to look.. male and female. I explained it was okay, and asked if they had any questions. SOME DID but mostly they were amazed I was up and walking and talking just like a normal person. Most of my staff is female, it was a perfect educational session and I shared anything anyone wanted to know (right down to the morphine hallucinations after surgery). At least half of those women went home and checked their breasts and made appointments in the first few weeks.    I work in a care facility with three levels of care, Independent Residents, Assisted Living Residents, and Expressions ( an early dementia secure area) There are 150 residents there of which my mother is one of the Independent Residents. Not only do all my staff and co managers, know what is happening but so do all of the residents that live there. I can thank my mother for some of that, but ya know? Once the hair is gone and the scarf is there? They would have known something anyway. I mean really - the gossip with seniors (75-95 years old) is tremendous and they would have thought I had joined a gypsy band or something... So, they all ask how I am. Most of them are really enquiring genuinely, at the very least because they are friends of my mothers.   Some people think I have breached my own privacy beyond acceptable limits - but I guess if I didn't have brass ones before... Cancer, mastectomy and chemo gave them to me.   AND it is SO NICE not to have to put on a front. I can say.. Yeah, you know what? I AM tired, but I am alive, I am feeling quite well and thank you for remembering I am a nurse, mother, woman who had a disease. The disease you see.. does not have ME!!!!!!  Karyll PS - sorry it is so long... couldn't help meself. ",

Even they aren't so bad really - I just feel like a slug. So still keeping on. My IV arm was very sore this whole time, so I am hoping for a different vein this time. I am getting my periods every three weeks - which means only 2 weeks without a month, it is frustrating. I will ask them today about this - It inevitably starts just before I start chemo within the first few days before, usually on the weekend. It waited till Monday this time though. The only trouble I am having is with my eyes, tearing, puffy, watery all the time. Its not SO bad but it makes me look worse than I feel and I keep hearing \"You look so tired\". Well darn it, you are making me tired with these comments... lol My taste buds are nearly back to normal so I will have to adjust to aspartame and cardboard again soon. ANd the SMELL thing - I was sitting here thinking gawwdddd what is with that vinegar? I smelled it everywhere I went. LMAO,well true confessions, I have stinky feet all the time (life long problem) and my stinky feet smell has changed to vinegar in my brain. SO at least now I know, if I smell vinegar it is most probably my feet... LOL.... See you after chemo - Karyll",

It was like I left my hair in a too tight ponytail for too long. The buzzing fixed that, and fortunately I have a nice head.. lol.. However with this weather (cold Alberta) I find that I have to wear my hat even in the house. A little brain melt down, shivering, cold, turned up the heat.. finally occured to put a hat on.. Problem solved, turned the heat back down cos everyone was nearly cooked... hahaha. So now I think I could be naked and warm, so long as I have my furry toque!Although I don't think I will try that anytime soon. My teenagers would go ino cardiac arrest.   Anyone with mastectomies have partners that have seen the scar close up and personal? Mine won't look at my chest even when I am dressed. Not that I want to show it off neccessarily but I feel like an eskimo all padded up - even getting dressed is a challenge \"in case\" someone sees me - My youngest son asked to see it right after surgery when it was all icky, but now it just looks like floppy weird skin and I am afraid to leave the door open in the bedroom when I am dressing. ALso, another question for your mastectomy folks. I keep seeing a reference to getting the \"dog ears\" removed with reconstruction. What the heck part of the incision is the dog ears? I have some floppy parts under my arm but that is true for both sides, that the bra kinds tucks in or they roll over, and I have like a knob (doesn't that sound disgusting) near the center of my chest - end of incision.... SO I am trying to decide which part is the dog ear... LOL. Karyll",

I gotta do something more about that for next time. I am experiencing some taste changes, (everything still tastes like it has aspartame in it)... and I feel like I have the hangover from hell today. Not much nausea though and intake of food and fluids is still good but tiring and weak most of the day. Although I must admit I feel better if I MAKE myself do something, especially if I have to go outside for it. Generally I feel a little confused sometimes... losing track of my sentence part way - but I am also taking pain medication for a back issue. That MAY have something to do with it too. My scalp is sore and it is only day 5 so I didn't think I was quite due for that yet.. lol.. but I have a wig and scarf if I need to buzz sooner than anticipated. I do not have a port - I will be having each of 8 treatments IV unless my arm cannot manage it, says the Onc.  I like the visualization of chemo being happy, positive,and cheerfully murdering the baddddd cancer cells! I am sure I will have a fit of giggles with the next IV push of red Epirubicin. (well maybe AFTER I take my ativan!!!) Feel well and may the Force be with you all!!!! Karyll",

My first cocktail (that I have finished now) is FEC which appears to be the Canadian version of A/C I am not sure though. I DO know that adriamycin and epirubicen (which is my E) are pretty similar Red Devils - the F is 5FU which has been on the news lately *sigh* and the C is cyclophosphamide or something, which I think is the same C, or a sister of it or something. So I start Taxotere tomorrow, it seems interesting that I will only have one chemical this time, and am hoping that makes life a little easier. However - I think it just may be different. I am not scheduled to have the neulesta shot yet, I guess they wait to see how my counts fare but I tell ya at flu season, it feels a little nervy. I had to take an ativan tonight - man, I thought I was over the anxiety part of this chemo except for the dread part - but I am feeling like I have not already done this first bit because I just don't know what to expect for me.

I phoned the cancer clinic yesterday and they said it is odd.. but two ladies also have called in with the same issue. The Dr. Says he is looking into it and they will reduce my dosage next time around. Of course the saga didn't end here - I am lying around watching tv waiting and hoping for the ibuprofen to kick in on my burning feet when I noticed my heart rate running to beat the band. I clocked it at about 140 at rest. SO I took an ativan, convinced myself to calm down and managed to get it down to about 120 with deep breathing. Then I started getting sharp pains in my left armpit (not the mastectomy side) and these pains darting across my chest, across my incision on the right and round to my back. Well by now, I suspect I am not only feeling lousy (day 5 after chemo) but I am having rather a lot of anxiety on top of it all. I had been running a very low grade temperature all day not enough to put out the \"infecion\" red light. It doesn't help that I mostly live alone (teen gone to work) and I starting getting very scared. So I had to make several phone calls to get a ride to be dropped off at ER. I figured nothing else was going to settle me down an maybe they could \"fix\" it. Once I got there, they immediately scared the sh*t out of me, put me on complete bed rest, started all the cardiac tests and told me they suspected pulmonary embolus (blood clot on the lung - that could kill me if it moved)I did not know that with mastectomy, and chemo - pulmonary embolus is a real risk and I therefore am a high risk factor. (Sometimes ignorance is bliss). So to make a long story a tad shorter, they kept me up all night doing blood work and tests and a CT scan of my chest this morning (with dye) to show that I have no blood clots, I have no new regrowth (one perk of having that test) and my heart is okay. They figure the shooting pains are chest wall pains from all the trauma my body has been through and mostly all they can do is treat the symptoms. SO I came home with pain killers, still feeling a bit shaky and weak but relieved to know I am not going to \"blow a clot\" at any ole time. I am upset about having to miss work - this was a big week that I have missed but what can you do - Hopefully the powers that be, will understand all of this and not give me a \"black\" mark. I still feel pretty 6 days after chemo -ish but will just have to give in to it this week and let it let me rest.... *sigh*.. Usually I just save the resting for my time off. I guess Maw Nature or Godbywhatevername is saying NO NO NO honey.. YOU WILL REST NOW. Hopefully back on the springboard on the weekend some time - can make up some hours then if all is well.... Anyway, just wanted to update. I have done unreasonably well through all of this treatment, and even now apart from fears and the unknown, have done okay with this one too I guess (except for the bone pain)The tests all say I was over reacting... lol...but honestly, how do you know if you don't know. I just knew something \"Wasn't right\" but I guess it is okay... so back to normal now maybe... I sure hope. Karyll",

Getting up to pee, or drink or eat, left me exhausted and even sitting here is wearing me out today. This was my 2nd taxotere, of which I had a 4 week break in between and I have one more to go. A few weeks ago, I was excited about being half way done treatments and now I have these two weeks to get through and another treatment and it feels longer away than half way through. The taxotere has whupped me I swear. I have a lot of tingling, numbness and pain in my feet although better than last time as they extended the \"roids\" to help avert some of the horrid swelling and inflammation I had last time.   I go for a muga scan next week and then I assume sometime in the next 5 weeks I will have an appt with a rad oncologist. This is my first week on official medical leave, and I am so glad I have not had to work this week - surprisingly. However, I do find I don't have a focus (which is maybe good this week) but I get up and don't quite know what to do with myself. So much to do, so little energy, so little motivation yet, so much time to \"think think think\" and I don't be liking the thinking as it all seems a little morose being this worn out and tired. Tomorrow is another day though, those counts have to start coming up soon and maybe I won't feel like a soggy pasta dish when I get up in the morning. I HAVE to go out and about tomorrow, so I will find a way. Tonight, I gave in and did nothing - I upset my kids. They haven't been helping and I just lost it and cried and wept about how I was too weak to do it (clean the kitchen and take out the garbage) and under much duress, they actually did it. I am grateful. They are 19 and 16 and I shouldn't even have to tell them really. I look ghastly, sheeesh, they must not even have a look to see WHY the dishes etc. aren't done. Or maybe they don't even notice. Anyway, I do think I got a bit of a message across yesterday and today. At least I hope. I don't mind reminding them to help me, I hate having to beg and cajole. My tongue is vicious right now, My mother called to assuage HER worry of course, and I just told her to quit phoning me every single day to make me have to dwell and think about how I am feeling when I am just trying to get through the day as I can. I am sure I hurt her feelings but for some reason, she thinks she is helping ME by enquiring as to how I am feeling every single day. She is only trying to reasssure herself that I am no dead yet. SEE? wicked..... and I feel that way, I don't really even like being in my own skin right now. So I think it is back to the couch/bed for awhile, maybe till the morning. I have to find a bed I can get out on the right side of sometime this week. Hugs and Blessings everyone. Sorry for the rant. Karyll",

They had trouble putting the IV in so gave me an ativan to relax, after that I didn't care too much about what was going. I have had no immediate reactions to the chemo or to the other drugs they gave me - except for feeling a bit spacy after the ativan. They were very good and attentive there and I didn't need half the stuff I brought...I did have some strange feelings in my body that were so fleeting I thought I might be imagining things. However - now once again... waiting... to see how I will feel this time. The \"thing\" they saw on my adrenal gland was a benign adenoma and my muga scan came through with flying colors. SO forward and onwards I say. Karyll",

I have tried all the over the counter stuff too, I even drank some \"shudder\" aloe vera juice which actually helped the scald. After I ate some chocolate chip cookies and found out that little sin was most probably the cause I drank finally some baking soda and water. THAT neutralized the acid better  than any of the OTC remedies! I was afraid I might explode mixing acid and soda but it was merely the biggest most satisfying belch of my life... lol..  I am back to work this week and most of the weekend and part of next week before my next treatment. Its been easy to say I am feeling good when I really haven't had to DO anything much that required effort so we shall see how this all goes. Next tx I don't have the luxury of having a week off following so I have kinda figured out what days I will take off as off days so as to meet my FT equivalency. At least I do have that flexibility. My hair hasn't started coming out yet, and I am day... ummm.. 12 I guess so I may make it to the weekend. If not, I am prepared with a friend with a groomer (read buzz cutter) and a couple of cloth hats and a wig. I dunno which way I will go till I get there!!!... Have a great day everyone! Karyll",

Then I went through the gamut and had to have two biopsies to clarify what the lump was. I do indeed have breast cancer but the point is - they used the ultrasound as a \"closer\" look than the mammogram so don't freak out yet... You may be just as well off. At your age you may have to push to have it checked further if they are reluctant. Come to Alberta *wink* I have a great bunch of Docs here! You most certainly do need to push and shove your way to a biopsy too but even with our provincial health care cutbacks (us too) they will fast track through a lot of the \"crap\" when there is a suspicious growth/lump.

I have to work Full Time and so I schedule my days off for when I am really really low which is Day 5 and 6 post chemo. Day 7 isn't fabulous but if I really let myself crash down on the other two days, I can manage to get through very long days at work to compensate for missed hours. I am fortunate in it that way - I can be fairly flexible. However, I do end up working lots of hours and that in itself is nasty and of course more tiring.   Constipation too is probably my biggest complaint - and even when I am not taking all the meds, I am still having to do things about stool softeners and worse.   I have not had any issues with mouth sores, although my gums and lips are dry and stick together and get a bit sore, I am constantly drinking and I even bought a moistening spray to have on hand. Natural Saliva.. ICK... I always feel like I am spraying with someone elses spit... but it does the trick mostly. My mucous membrane troubles seem to be at the other end. I have been plagued with vag. yeast infections frequently throughout my life but have pretty much learned how to avoid them. The other day I got the familiar \"itch\" and thought OH NOOOO it's been years. So I went to pharmacy and they told me to use the OTC stuff - I have been doing the yogurt and acidophollus thing which were usually the mainstream cure for me. But they told me if I didn't get better to see my GP and get the PILL. I am assuming it is like flucanazole or the like. *sigh*. I was hoping not to go to Dr. these two weeks but it looks like it is in the cards. Have a fabulous week everyone!!! This too shall Pass... heheheeh Karyll",

And that the swelling is actually a good thing. SO here I am buzzing along on steroids (pre-meds) for the day and a half I have been taking them, and no chemo. Kind of a perk in one way - I have next week off as vacation in planning for the chemo reaction and now I am not sure what I will do. I spoke to the social worker and she is getting some paperwork started for me. I guess I will find out more next week. She did offer some options - ask \"them\" to pay for my health care prescription benefits and our provincial monthly cost or ask them to lay me off with severance pay, or claim bankruptcy when I reach the end of my financial rope with this \"leave\". Anyway, I am still going to take my weeks \"vacation\" and it might actually BE like one, I am feeling relatively well although that fatigue is hanging in there, and I can put my swollen feet up more often during the day. They will be expecting me to return to work on the 7th which will be right after chemo on Thursday and I am not sure which way to play there. Hopefully I can receive some clarity over the next few days. I am leaning towards just arranging the medical leave to start that day. Although I was hauled into a meeting today as some of you know regarding a work related issue (not me) and the chief ops told me I did excellent work, commendable how I handled all of that... ummm... scuze me? could I have that in writing? sheeeesh....Weirdos More typing to come - Ulla hang in there - next post.

Last week my white cells were 33 and today they were 13.5 which is what they were pre - chemo in the first place. I guess that extra week really gave me a boost in the blood count department. Today, I had a reduced dosage, administered slowly, ice boots and ice gloves on the whole time. I will take the steroids for an extra week - hoping to avoid the \"adverse\" reactions that I had with the last round. I have emailed work about \"medical leave\" and have the doc's certificate, and I am to phone the GM tomorrow morning to discuss things further. I honestly don't know what he has in mind. I am meant to go back to work after vacation on the 7th - that is likely to be a \"bad\" day for the chemo for me so I don't think I will be arriving there, unless maybe it is to pick up my walking papers. So far so good post chemo - I have taken a benadryl and an ativan. My feet unfortunately are already tingling so I am hoping to cut that of at the pass. Otherwise, I feel relatively normal... lol...whatever that might be... Glad to hear of everyones experiences. Ulla what ARE we going to do with you - there has to be a way to get through all of this that is less painful for you. Although we have a ton of empathy and sympathy for you and with you, I wish we could do more in the here and now. Unfortunately a lot of it comes from within, and you being so isolated really doesn't give you an opportunity to seek out the help that I am sure is there for you. Are there any inpatient clinics/hospitals etc. that can monitor you and your medications that would perhaps be more effective? Sometimes what they do here, is admit someone to the hospital to assess medication, counsel, try new medications, and reassess. It can be sometimes done over just the period of a few days - It sounds kind of icky I know, but if it is beneficial in the long run, it may be worth the investigation. With this kind of depression, they are admitted in a suicide watch and I am not saying you are suicidal, because you obviously are beating this thing in the face to live but you have so much grief that you need to relief. A loss is the same as a death, and the grieving procedure is very much the same for the loss of limb,(boob), loss of family (move), loss of appearance /personal image(chemo ravage) and finally the loss of your unborn child with life changing experience. That is a LOT to deal with ... You need someone close by that can help you through it, perhaps it is time to confide in a family member that you can talk to and that can spend time with you... I don't really know. The cure for cancer is more than just chemical, and surgical - it is emotional and spirtual too. We need to find you a way to get through this time of emotional and spiritual grieving and the chemical and surgical will take care of itself. At least I am glad to read that you have some moments of peace - take those moments one at a time and use them to seek out the help that is available in your physical reality too.... wish I could say or do more. hugggss Karyll",

Right Mastectomy with SNB and axillary node dissection. First chemo was September 27th and could have been just a week sooner if my drain had not had to stay in so long. My onc explained that they need to wait 5-6 weeks after surgery before having chemo, simply because of the risk of infection. They want to insure that all is healed well, because we are high risk women being fatigued from the surgery, and basically have a \"wound\" that is just prime for infection. So, if you start chemo already vulnerable to infection, you are setting yourself up for other issues. I thought I would never get finished being scanned. Pre-op of course the mammo, ultrasound. Then two biopsies (first one was inconclusive) Then a CT with contrast scan of what seemed like my whole body.(had to have a second one of those too due to an abnormality on my kidney of all things but it was BENIGN), chest xray, muga scan, bone scan. They don't often do the PET scan in my area I understand. Then this Dr. and this pharmacist, and this clinic, and this part of that part of every part of the city and my body. At least it feels that way. I had a pelvic ultrasound in there too because it was previously booked before all hell broke loose. The day pre-chemo I had blood work and then all was silent. I watched and waited, experienced the symptoms and I didn't have to GO anywhere to be poked or prodded. IT was a strange sense of calm in that way - and I am still waiting for the other shoe to drop. I think that is normal though.   In the middle of all this about 4 weeks post op, I had been having this lower back pain. Of course scared me to death, I figured I had bone mets. Well this pain started sometime after surgery and continued getting worse and worse to the point of actually having to call an ambulance to get me to the hospital for these back spasms that rendered me totally helpless. They put me on all kinds of drugs for pain and inflamation and relaxation. It took some weeks but it did help. The very curt and abrupt ER doc. put me off at first, but as the pain was easing in hospital, he said... I know you have been through a lot, but not every event dear, is a cancer event. Thank GOD someone told me that.... because it was probably a big part of the healing and pain that I was having. I heard him say to the ER Nurse, I wonder what they did to her on that operating table. It never occured to me prior to that, that this pain may have originated from then. If you think about the position that you have to be in for a radical mastectomy (I imagine), My arm raised high over my head, possibly bent, twisting the spine so that they can have a clear view/access to remove a large part of your chest and armpit. WOW, good thing we are asleep. Coupled with, now I am walking different, I am protecting my right side, so perhaps putting weight differenly on the \"other\" side and the weight shift has changed. It's not much wonder my back hurt post op. I have corrected that now, ensuring my posture is balanced, I have a weighted little thing in my bra - doc said don't get real prosthesis until after rads - due to shifts in skin and weights/shapes etc. I have a swim form actually that almost matches... lol... I don't even care that I am lopsided, oh my how things change.   Wow, that was a lot... lol... thanks for listening!!!! Hope you that have just had treatment are feeling okay. My 2nd chemo was the same as the first only better (no heartburn) and I am on the upswing so I know I have a couple of \"good\" weeks before the next tx. Amazing how much you can get done when you know you don't have much time before you will feel like crap again.. lol Blessings Karyll",

I am not doing reconstruction and I have to admit I DO feel like I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel today (must be the good drugs post chemo) hehehehe... I still have to consider whether or not to have radiation - for some reason I feel quite apprehensive about that, and must be pretty compelling for me to do so. ALthough I am not going to worry about that until it is time to - I just don't know if there is a huge difference in recurrence rates. I guess I have more research to do.

I start Taxotere on the 29th of November and I do hear that although there are different side effects they certainly do not make you so sick to your stomach. That will be a blessing. Nothing tastes really good to me right now, and honestly if my little toe twitches I think OMG - is that cancer too? You are normal - everything isn't about cancer but it sure feels like it could be. My mastectomy site gets all yucky sore, puffy, tender post chemo too. I am not fluidy but its difficult wearing any sort of a bra all day. You feel so tired because they knock all the white cells out of your body. Those are your immune cells so if you got a cold - the white cells would run to your defense and kill that cold virus. However - the chemo knocks out those little fighters so they don't run to the perceived virus that is chemotherapy and try to kill it instead. And that is why we all get so tired. The chemotherapy does things to our blood that usually fight for us and without the fighters, we are fatigued because they are not doing the fight. The breaks in between chemo's are a time to let your white blood cells build up and gradually why you feel a bit better when it is time to \"knock you down again\" and I think why we all find the strength to do it yet again. SO here is CHEERS to being finished with the FEC. My fatigue is much worse this time too - and it is partly the time of year I think... the season, everyone singing bah humbug Christmas songs.. ( I am teasing) and one wonders how they can be so light hearted when all \"this\" is going on. The FEC also is doing strange things to my hormones which is effecting my emotions. I have my period every two weeks, then it stops and now, I am having cramps and spots not to mention hot flashes....it's like I am in menopausal adoloscent hell... lol.. ANd when people say they feel like a teenager again, I kinda understand that.. because I am having these outbursts that just aren't me - tears, rage, laughter all in the same five minutes putting my 16 year old to shame. I couldn't find the cancer society in our town today - and I felt I should just stop in the middle of the road, get out my car, whip off my scarf and say \"CAN'T SOMEONE TELL ME WHERE IT IS?\" Obviously I didn't, but to even have the thought of doing that, is very unlike me. And now, I feel as tired when I wake up, as when I went to sleep.... SO maybe we should all just have a pyjama party and be maniacs with estrogen over and under surges.... Can't you just see it? well.. maybe not. Seriously Ulla, thoughts and prayers are with you and your husband. It's okay to be scared, its okay to be sad, its okay to have weird thoughts - its okay to cry, and it is very important to let the docs help you if they can with anti depressants or anti anxiety or whatever they have for you that will help. There IS something out there somewhere.... but I think we are done with the nausea part now you and I... at least the worst of it. If you can bear it, try sucking on popsicles - ice lollies. I dunno what they call them there. Frozen juice, or flavors on a stick. That will soothe your palette which is probably swollen from all this torment pack we are ingesting. You could have a bug too - so always get these concerns checked....There may be something that fits you well and helps you through..... ((((((((Hugs)))))))) to you and to everyone else who is having blue moon this week!!! Awww, okay, hugs to you even if you are feelin fine!!! I love you all. Karyll",

I tried a sports mastectomy bra (that was a little better) and it doesn't dig into the incision. I thought that I was swollen sort of under my arm because it seemed like there was an overhang of flabby fluidy stuff there that shouldn't be there over the bra - then I held up both arms and looked.. BEHOLD --- it was just flab because I have a matching pair - the mastectomy side looked worse because of discoloration from the incision. I guess that angry look will go away some day. The Doc advised me not to get too heavy a prosthesis right away, and in fact wait to be fitted until after radiation. So I bought a \"swim form\" because that little cotton fluffy kept wanting to rise up rise up and I was constantly pulling the bra down so I needed something with a little weight. I thought of putting coins or beans or something in there to hold it down but finally sprung the 49.00 for this clear weird feeling half boob. It does the trick and has helped my shoulder and back pain because now I am more evenly weighted. I sure couldn't be a model or anything mind you ( a little uneven, still raises up a bit, and doesn't quite match size wise) But then I couldn't have been a model before either... SO I guess it is okay for now. People have stopped ogling my chest now - to see if they can tell - so I am comfortable enough being a little \"off\". My arm has not and is not swollen - I have been very fortunate but I do have some more pains in the incision and the armpit following chemo - I try to tell myself it is the poison poisoning the poison... hehhehe...THe pain is generally fleeting though and I do have a little fluid retention immediately following treatment, particularly around the bra line but it dissipates within a few days. Scared hell out of me first time. I have the puffiest eyes and eyelids mind you - I look a bit like the pillsbury dough boy. I think it is partially from the sleeping medication I rely on heavily - mixed in with the short course of steroids - and the fact that I have lost my eyelashes and brows making it even more obvious. I dunno, I often look (to me) like I have had a week long crying jag - but if I resort to some of the makeup provided, it is not as bad.... Well I dunno - but I can tell by the expressions on people when they say \"how are you feeling\" whether I look bad or not... LMAO...Otherwise, it's good grief, you look good are you feeling that good too? LMAO.... SO.. who knows? Have a great week everyone ! Karyll",

Today I just feel more like my icky self 5 days post chemo so I hope I can get this show on the road for tomorrow and get back to work. I woke up at my usual time 0500 so that is a good sign. I will phone the cancer clinic today and explain my experiences to see if there is something I can do to combat this ongoing ache - and reduce or remove that severe pain from coming back the next time. Last night I found some old \"heavy duty\" pain killers that I had for my back pain just shortly after diagnosis - I figured well? back pain? feet pain?Hip pain? Not far off the mark and I got a good 6 hours sleep without interruption. I am going to break down and call in sick - and deal with that fallout later and on Wednesday I Have two meetings that I have to attend to so will stagger through those somehow and hope that it will be the beginning of my upswing. I am not due for chemo again until he 27th so hopefully will be much more prepared this time. They did change my tx so I actually started the Taxotere one course early - I had planned for the tx to fall over Christmas and so had booked time off for that. However, I will now have booked time off for the second tx and it may seem like I will need it. Then I will just have to cope with the last treatment - and figure out away to get some days off around there. My FEC did not cause me to miss any real days of work except for some scheduling adjustments so this is a bit of a downer for me. I just guess they will have to figure it out without me... lol.... I know they will manage fine. ANyway, blah blah blah. Thanks for seeing me through the worst (what I hope is the worst )of it all ladies. Karyll",

So the cancer clinic phoned me yesterday and asked me to call them back today (remembering I just got out of hospital yesterday) to enquire as to my well being - I saw one of the chemo nurses whilst at the hospital on my way home yesterday and she was the one that called. Said I seemed \"out of it\" go figure! and wanted to make sure I was okay. So I said I hear that other ladies were experiencing extreme foot pain along with my other type symptoms as well.... She said yes, they are investigating the \"lot\" number of the Taxotere you all had...and that is ongoing, but not to worry - I will get a reduced dose next time and I can wear the ice boots as well as the ice gloves. Now doesn't that sound like fun? I am day 7 post chemo and having my first bout with yeasty mouth - no sores, just mungy - using my biotene. I have no appetite but I am not sick and I have to eat to take the T3's for my aches and pains. I have fallen in love with gatorade which I would have sworn was the nastiest stuff on earth before this even worse than when I was little and drank Kool-aid. My house looks like world war 3 with 100 years of dirt on top. And then my employer emailed me (after I emailed and said I would not make it in this week) and informed me that I must have a \"meeting\" regarding my attendance next Friday. They are \"concerned\" because some things have been going on and that perhaps I am not doing my job. So head office chief ops is making a special trip into town to meet with me. The GM is uncomfortable with \"this\" situation of me having to miss a week of work. ( considering I have missed a total of three weeks with mastectomy surgery and 4 chemotherapy doses and still managed to work Full Time) I feel a bit like I have been slapped in the face. They wanted me to take medical leave after surgery - why I do not know. I suspect they will push for that again on Friday. I am scheduled to take vacation over Christmas (2 weeks worth because I was unable to take vacation all year)and I have no sick time. There is no disability at work - therefore - I can't NOT work. So after all this time working my ass off, being up, being positive, not letting anyone down - they are calling a disciplinary meeting. NOw I know they can't terminate me for illness - but they can start building a case that I am terminated for \"other\" just cause. So I am on the blue side of the world today - not to mention my counts are probably crap at this point in the chemo - and I just need a hug or something to make me remember that everything happens for a reason - I shouldn't fret, I have been doing my job and can look at myself in the mirror honestly and say I have always given my all at work but for some reason, I just can't find anything positive in this situation. I feel like I am losing this forward motion battle. Don't get me wrong - I don't feel THAT bad physically - my emotions are playing hell with me and usually I can just suck it up but today is really one of THOSE days. I just had to tell SOMEone that would understand because no one round here does. Thanks for listening. I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming. Karyll",

I have not had any mouth issues though I have to admit. The Biotene mouthwash and paste have been my saving grace. Miss Lolli, we can still be mad at my job for the way they handled it... lol...and the \"gossip\" is that sheesh, no one wants my job temporarily - so they are having some struggles.. muaahh haaa haaa. Mood swings - wow, my pilot light in my furnace went out today. I have never been able to relight it, I dunno why. I am usually a fiercely independent woman who can do anything she sets her mind to. Lately, physical limitations have put some limitations on what I can set my mind to do. I am adjusting to that part of it to a degree, but this emotional thing is knocking me for a loop. I phoned the boyfriend to walk me through lighting the pilot light, he did it last time. I ended up in a puddle of tears in front of the furnace, sobbing the b/friend on the phone. He is getting mad because I couldn't do it. I am sobbing \"*hiccup*but I couldn't do it when I was well how can I do it nowwwwwww\"? And then I think the torrent started off every little thing. This taxotere has hit me hard in the fatigue and weakness department. I have never ever felt helpless in my entire life and today - I felt as fragile and weak as a china cup. I surely thought the world was shattering around me. Now, obviously, this couldn't have all been over a pilot light - because I did finally get it lit. (after an ativan and sheer grit) I just had a complete reality check that things have changed a LOT. I don't like this emotional wimpy thing.... who the hell is she? Anyway, my point of all this is that I know I will get past this part too, I am already halfway there by writing about it and kicking it to the curb - I guess with steroid rage (I had it alright), chemopause/menopause, chemo itself, cancer, uncertainty, and radiation looming after one more taxotere - I'm really feeling the strain of it all. Not going to work has stopped me from \"faking it till I make it\". Now I am just trying to make it... LOL AND suddenly my hair is growing in leaps and bounds.. I dunno, maybe the taxotere worked in reverse? hehehehe - I know it may fall out, but I actually had a little matted bit.... right there... over my ear. But *ahem* I am also getting sideburns....I am praying for eyelashes soon - they have been gone for weeks and my eyes are irritated all the time. I go for a muga scan tomorrow, and they phoned and booked the rad. oncology consult for February 15th. That will be ten days after my last Taxotere and if I feel anything like this, I will need someone to take me there. It's in Calgary so is an hour and a half each way. We have no radiation here, so as the time comes it will be a daily commute of three hours I guess. I have  a bro that I can stay with if nec. but seems silly to not be home 20 out of 24 hours for a half hour treatment.   Well I think I must be feeling better, I am blabbbbbing again. I am always reading and keeping up even if I don't post too often. Blessings everyone! Karyll",

Then I finally got dressed and checked on line and laid down at 3 til 7. At 7 I thought well this is ridiculous so I went and had a bath, settled into jammies, turned on Law and Order (yippeee not a re run) at 8pm. I woke up at 2:15 AM to some cartoon. So then I pottied and thought gee... why don't I go to sleep for a change and promptly crashed until 830 in the morning. I guess that may be something happens after the steroids stop.

I know that sounds odd but for showering, washing, getting dressed - you can have both hands free with simple shoe lace tied around your neck, to hook the drains on to. Honestly that saved my so much. I am right handed, and of course it was a right sided mastectomy - so I hooked those little old drains to the shoelace around my neck and was able to manage all those two handed needs.I have heard of some, indulging in a nice heavy gold chain for the same reason - but it sure made my post surgery at home much easier - Particularly because I still had one of the drains at nearly three weeks.!

I was up to the bathroom 3 hours post op with a walk along assistance and like mentioned above.. pants, wiping everything was very difficult...I am SO right handed. I had the surgery Tuesday late afternoon and was home Thursday at 1100 am. armed with pain medication and dressing supplies. I did take some pain medication the first few days but gradually that is down to none. I am still awaiting tests as well - and I go for a bone scan tomorrow (common protocol) but I am aware of any twinge, ache, pain, thought all the time 24/7. I am learning to use distraction not to dwell on the what if's... because really? What if - You just have to deal with whatever comes up.. one thing at a time. That is how I got through the first 5 weeks prior to mastectomy. (I had a large tumor too 3.5 cm, and quite a few positive lymph nodes) My oncologist says it is aggressive, so he will treat aggressively and I begin chemo therapy on the 27th of September. 5 weeks after my surgery. Yeah, I am beat - today is actually the first day that I have not had some test, appointment or something to do with cancer since the firm diagnosis. I am certainly no expert nor have I had the experiences that these gals have but I can tell you first hand that the mastectomy is physically not as bad as you might imagine. I am even getting used to the new me - clothes are a bit of an issue... lol.. but hey, you live and learn.. LIVE being the key word there. Karyll in Canada",

I guess I was \"sick\" and didn't know it - if you read the triple neg board, you will find that many/most of the women there had their tumors appear \"overnight\" and had done everything right to pay attention to their bodies but still - it literally just showed up unexpectedly. Was it brewing there awhile undetected? I suspect so in retrospect but nothing in the world that we have now had picked it up, cept my own sudsy little hand in the bath and it was literally THERE and 3.5 cm. That is from what I have gleaned here, one of the amazingly typical thing of triple neg. (sudden appearance of a full blown lump) The rest is all individual as we all are. The stats are old, they are based on 5 or even 10 year ago drugs (thats when they started those trials) AND they are still to this very moment, finding out new things every day. Maybe before you or I or any triple neg has a recurrence, they will have an actual full blooded solution. (I pray this for everyone, not just triple negs of course) Blessings to all. Karyll ",

It is a visual for me that works usually. I am just very very tired and I guess if that is my worst complaint I am doing well. Onwards and forwards - Chemo #4 on the 29th which is a source of anxiety because I do not know what to expect with the Taxotere. I have read the symptoms but I have had differnt things happen.

They only have two here and mine is away...so it is a new guy. But they are concerned because my liver counts are way out of whack. My white counts are fine, but they wanted to know if I had been doing any herbals or anything which I have not. My in depth blood test were just fine about 6 weeks ago. They state that chemo does not cause liver issues as a rule. Of course I didn't have the presence of mind to ask what do you mean \"out of whack\" nor did I have the presence of mind to ask if this may indicate mets. I have had pain and bloating in my upper abdomen for a couple of days, I thought it was my ongoing constipation issues so resolved that (I WAS constipated) but the bloated and pain feelings really did not go away. SO armed with no accurate information - I am seeking out answers to liver mets signs and symptoms. Well of course, they are bloating and pain as I described... and I find myself in my mind at the beginning and on hold. Waiting to find out what is wrong and what it will mean. I will have more blood taken on Tuesday, then I will talk to the oncologist to find out what the \"new plan\" is - that is what the nurse said. I may have to phone the clinic tomorrow and see if there is a possibility that it is mets... Cos I don't know if I can wait till Tuesday. But then -  am also afraid to phone and ask and may wait till Tuesday after all. I am going to stay with a friend on the weekend cos she is tired of me going through all of this alone as well.   I was scheduled for rad oncologist on the 15th of Feb Ulla, so we are very close indeed. I don't know what this new thing will mean though so again.. on hold. I HATE IT ALL.   I am glad you are through the red devil though Sue. Like Ulla I had the FEC... I too wonder about the combination. However, it is what it is and I guess whatever this liver stuff is.. it is too. Light and Love to everyone!!!! Cross your fingers for me. Karyll",

There is sometimes nausea (throwing up is not an option he told me.. lol) and usually a couple of days of extreme fatigue. I am taking the week off after my first chemo to try and map out how I will feel - generally - and then should be able to work some flex hours around it. He assured me I will be able to at LEAST work half time but suspects I will try to do more - He did say that the \"people\" risk of infection is probably quite great where I work and I have to use very sane judgement in NOT exposing myself to risk while my white counts are low. I dunno, if that helps at all but I think I am having all the same questions right now too and we won't know exactly how we are going to feel, until we actually feel it. Ain't it fun? NOT.... lol Karyll",

(((((Gentle Huggggssssss)))))) to you and your boys. I am just thinking about hotflashes honeygirl. Prior to \"all\" this, I was having the pre menopausal symptoms - still regular as clockwork but hot flashes, mood swings - different lengths of cycle kinda icky things.   On my surgery day (also right side modified radical mast.- no reconstruction) I was in OR and recovery for5 hours (blood pressure issue for me and morphine too) and I had to get up out of bed to go to the toilet.. cossssssssss you got it - My period arrived 7 days early. Then it stopped for two weeks and came back. I blamed it on all the surgery. I thought, oh well at least I am through with that until after chemo which was two weeks later.. unh unh... oh no.. Day 1of chemo the 27th of Sept. guess what arrived just after I received the first ativan of my life at the cancer clinic pre- treatment. Yesterday a mere 11 days later... guess who is bleeding like a stuck pig. NOW - I have heard of chemo PAUSE but this appears to be chemo FAST FORWARD. However, the reason I bring all this up... lol... slow to the point... I have not had a hot flash for nearly two months!!!!!! And yes, your hormones take on a mind of their own. At least it seems so to me anyway!!!!!!!!    Nice to have you back Sue, I look forward to your posts everyday. You should be sleeping in the middle of the night right now.... hope you wake up feeling not quite so \"melted\" hehehehe. Karyll",

I just had my third treatment today - it is FEC which is a combo chemo cocktail, of 5FU (long chemical name), Epirubicin, and Cyclophosphamide (I think). I have had three of these now, three weeks apart. I took part of the first week off work as vacation (yuck) because I wanted to discover how I would feel and how I could work full time around that. It turns out that I can and have just rearranged my two days off to co incide with my two \"low\" days. I could even work on them really but it is when my blood count is at its lowest and I am very tired and at higher risk of infection. They give me steroids at the start and for a few days.  Like today, I worked very early till noon. I went for my chemo where they gave me steroids first and an anti nauseant and then the \"cocktail\". Right now I feel absolutely fine (well okay, maybe a little bit buzzed from the steroid) I will feel fine until Monday afternoon afternoon, when I have taken the last steroid dose and I can work through the weekend. Then I get very tired Monday night and I have to admit a little edgy and nervy.(not good to have a nervy, slightly irritable manager so I take Tuesday and Wednesday off work  because I kind of feel like I have a bad hangover. ( I haven't drank alcohol for 12 years, but I remember that feeling). I have not thrown up once - I have had a little tiny bit of nausea, but more of a gaunt feeling....and easily remedied. I take all my meds whether I think I need them or not. I drink a ton of water two days before, during and after (like 4 liters a day). I started shedding hair on the 14th day after my first chemo. I had a buzz cut on the 16th day. On the 17th day, there was more pubic hair in the toilet than on my whole body. I still have leg hair.... lol...and eyebrows. I have had so far, all my treatments by IV injection - and they don't foresee the need for a port in fact, discouraged it. I can't say I am symptom free - but you know? I feel better even in my \"down\" week - than I did waiting for test results, and maybe even better than I did last year at this time, because this thing was growing without my knowledge. So it depends so much - I was more tired before diagnosis than I am even on the low days! Remember that Sue - just like the mastectomy, the anxiety about it is worse than the actual effects... And they will give you something for that anxiety pre-chemo as well. That helped, even if I did feel like a zombie... lol. It's all about knowing what to expect. Oh yeah, I will lose my taste buds on Sunday but they will be back by Friday. I use biotene mouthwash and paste and have had tender gums but no sores. I think the best thing in the world to help this is drink water, drink water, drink water - even if it tastes funny - get the fluids in. I worked on the cancer unit where people had chemo years ago, and that was the key... they loaded them up with fluids, flush flush flush... and you should be doing that too... pee pee pee... lol... I was close to chest wall too - and will have to have radiation following the chemo. And then that too is it for me, being triple neg. Although, who knows by then they might have another tx, or even dare I say it... A CURE. Blessings everyone - Here is to putting one foot in front of the other, one day at a time, and enjoying every moment for what it is! Love and Hugs to all Karyll",

I just got so everytime someone came near, I lifted up my shirt... lol... Like you, I was quite terrified - I busied myself with things around the house and tried to get work tidied up for my absence. I knew it had to be done, but I didn't want it to be done. I wondered too if I would just run out of the OR screaming don't DO it but somehow,when you are right there, it is almost surreal (was for me anyway) and really still is. I know what happened, I know that I had a tumor in that breast, I know that I am going for chemo and I know that I might have radiation afterwards too. But what I focus on is - Tomorrow I have a muga scan and CT scan. Thats it. And after those scans tomorrow - I will focus on the fact that my first chemo is on Thursday. (unless more tests pop out of somewhere). It's hard, and it's hell and I believe it was Tender that described to me that waiting for tests, and results is like terrorism. It seems like hurry up and wait and then you don't really want to know the answer either, but you can't stand not knowing. Step by baby Step is how I have gotten this far - I know I have a long way to go yet but hey, if I put my focus on just the next foot moving forward, I can cope a bit better. This place here, has helped me to do that. The \"big\" picture is much too intimidating although you can't help but think about it - focusing on just the next bit can help you get through it all one piece at a time. and btw - hugggeeeee greatttt big hugggsss to you - always remember you are loved.

I look at all these women here with admiration for what they have been through, and are still here to tell the tale. I don't want it either.. believe me... My friend said to me... Karyll, you have been dealt a hand that you are forced to play... so lets play cards hon.  So hold on tight and we'll go on a helluva ride. I am only a couple of steps ahead of you here, so keep putting one foot in front of the other and you will be here too - on the other side of surgery- PS - My lump sitting there, hurt worse than the surgery to remove it.

They healing process takes time - make sure you are not wearing anything restrictive either - even armhole sleeves aggravated me at first. I drove for the first time at a week. I went to work in two weeks but was still limited with my mobility. I would reach for something out of habit (also right handed) and then go WHOAH wait a minute. It was three weeks post op before I could lie on my right side - but you gotta remember I also had a drain in for 22 days at home too. So it may be less time for you.    When my \"pit\" was throbbing I would lie or sit down move my arm a bit away from my side and have a pillow supporting the weight of my arm. Sometimes on my lap if I was sitting but in a semi lying position I could really put it up on pillows so it stopped rubbing against itself and was elevated with my elbow crooked. Does that describe it? But don't be a hero - take something - if it was not prescribed for you then buy some over the counter stuff - I think you have paracetamol there, or equivalent. Just eat a bit before you take them so you don't upset your tummy on top of everything else. Karyll",

The rest of the time I just go on \"function\" mode, until I start to feel human again (at least partly).People are amazed, awestruck, humbled that I am working through this... I think well yeah, I still gotta pay the mortgage and buy food so it is not so amazing really - it is neccessity. I would like to have the luxury of taking 7 or 8 days off during the chemo thing but it just ain't gonna happen for me....I wouldn't want to not work mind you - just would like a bit more rest in between.

He is bigger than my little cocker spaniel was and so when I say weight.. I MEAN It... lol and there is nothing like my jammies after work, I am lucky if I get all the way down the hallway to the bedroom before all my clothes are off - especially this godforsaken plastic thing I have for a boob. Off goes everything and heaven help anyone that makes me go out for anything. It will ALWAYS wait till tomorrow...... Have a great wonderful pet day. Hey? Is there such a thing? we have mom and dads day, and even grandparents day - is there a pet day? There surely should be!!!!! Karyll",

About 3 weeks later I was talking to him about just school stuff.. and said, now when my hair grows back it might be different; curly, white, thin, thick.. I dunno. He gave me this look first of shock, then of relief and then he grinned from ear to ear... and said.. \"OHHHH mommy (first time he has called me mommy since he was like 6) It's going to grow back?   Then it was my turn for shock - poor kid, talked about all this stuff coming off me, body parts, hair, white cells - neglected to tell him my hair would GROW BACK. Both my boys internalize so I try to be as up front and open about anything so that I can open the doors for them to feel free to discuss these things with me - fears, worries, excitements, challenges and all this time this poor kid, is thinking I am going to be bald and sick forever.... We haven't talked in great depth about the dying thing yet, because we don't know prognosis really - but I am going to have to be very vey careful when we do. We briefly touched on it, but I told them both not to dwell there and they seem to be okay about that, but I really wonder what their minds are up to - it's hard eh? But they seem interested and fairly upbeat (16 and 20) and have grown accustomed to my overly high forehead.. *Grin*... Sweet dreams to those sleeping, sweet moments to those awake. Karyll",

I have to have the steroids first too and during and one day after. It apparently does not cause nausea but they gave me some anti nauseants JUST in case. So far so good. I don't feel the blech that I did right after the FEC. I know that as the week goes on my white cells will decrease and I will feel tireder and may have some of the side effects of Taxotere, aches, pains, mouth troubles, nail issues but to know that I have completed the red devil successfully indicates to me that anything can be accomplished.Some say it is worse, some say it is better - it is all very individual. I believe in believing the best will be - and if it is not the best that happens - then I will get through it day by day by day. HUGGGGSSSS Karyll",

I am just able to spend any time comfortably on my right side.(mastectomy side) I usually sleep on my left side but I think I tossed and turned a lot. I cannot fall asleep on my back, but apparently I snore very loudly when I do, so I must roll over. When I do lie on my right side consciously, I have my arm up, kind of over my head so that I am not actually lying on my arm. It at least gives my left hip and ear a little pressure relief when I am lying around. I am sleeping and lying a lot this time around, so it is only recently that I have noticed I am able to roll to the mastectomy side without a thought, no twinge or anything. Hope that helps Karyll",

When I went to my \"class\" Look good feel better - they gave me one knee high stocking to put over my head, under my wig or scarf. They said it would help to hold anything secure. Right now I have bristles, and they act like velcro.. hehehe... but they are on their way out too. I don't know how cutting off a panty hose leg or something would work - but I thought it was quite novel to finally be the life of the party and wear nylons on my HEAD. Hey, could maybe pull it down over your face and rob a bank too? GOod grief the thoughts. Anyway, thought I would share that information about the hose. - oh my good friend suggested thumb tacks...and after we laughed ourselves nearly sick picturing that, we voted on double sided tape... I dunno - haven't tried any but I know I am not voting for the tacks or staple gun today!!! Karyll",

Isn't amazing, how good Nature is to us in some ways? The terrible fear thing, terrified of the mastectomy and all that comes and then nearly immediately afterwards saying thats that then - off with the other! I asked my oncologist about it, because like many here I think - why wait for another occurrence if this is such high risk. He explained that his process is to treat the active disease, then wait about a year all together to decide about the other breast - and how high stress, high risk, either recurrence and/or prophylactic surgery would be. So that is what I have been doing. Ignoring the one that's there whilst getting through chemo, asuming that chemo will keep anything else in my body at bay. Then - looking into the other one. (that sounds peculiar) Hope your first day full back at work is a good one. It was a great thing for me - I didn't have time to dwell or think what was wrong with me, I just kind of had to get on with it!!!!! Blessings",
