I would stop reading and researching because you are only making yourself sick with fear and worry. You should trust what your Drs say, trust what you know so far, and trust in the fact that everything looks benign/non-worrisome...those are all awesome things!! Post away here, chat, etc..while you wait, but I suggest you stop reading and researching..and this comes from a girl who has BTDT in your shoes and I KNOW what you are feeling right now. By the way, I truly believe you are going to get b9 results :)",

I had a mass found that they were 99% sure was benign based on my surgeon and 2 radiologists reports. They suggested a watch and wait for 6 months. I couldn't do that-I had to know so I had a core biopsy done and was very lucky that mine was benign and now I can stop worrying. So talk with your surgeon and see what he suggests and if he gives you the option of a biopsy, Id do it for the peace of mind. Good luck! Carrie",

I reviewed the notes from my prior BS visits and there was lots of mention of a lot of glandular breast tissue, fibrocystic, etc.. The tissue kinda feels irregular and hard but I realized its because Im pushing it down on a rib.

You responded to my post about fibroadenomatous changes being a precursor to a fibroadenoma.  I googled that being its my diagnosis via biopsy and it confirmed it, but the description of fibroadenomatous change doesn't match my ultrasound. IT says fibroadenomatous change doesn't have a defined lesion. My ultrasound looks just like a fibroadenoma-oval, circumscribed borders, etc..wonder why my biopsy didn't show fibroadenoma? It was u/s last week and it is unchanged from 2009. Im not really worried about it but I find it kinda odd!",

I kinda figured that was the case! Are they monitoring yours? They checked mine back in Oct and it was a tad smaller, then checked it this go round and it was the same.  I was like you too-I never saw my report but had the basics read to me a couple of times.",

I am dealing with this and trying to listen to my BS that it is nothing. My left breast has lumpier, thicker tissue that is sore (I am a heavy, heavy caffeine user) and everything looks normal and he says not to worry. I did have an area on that breast biopsied 2 years ago that came back b9 with fibroadenomatous change/fibrocystic disease.  :( When can i stop worrying? Log in to post a reply",
