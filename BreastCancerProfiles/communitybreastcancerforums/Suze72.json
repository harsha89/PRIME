I've had both a lumpectomy (to begin with ) and, just recently, a double nipple sparing mastectomy instead of radiotherapy. I'm currently sporting a pair of rock hard tissue expanders. Here's my story.... I was diagnosed with a 2.5cm IDC in my left breast last November. Everything happened so quickly for me at the start that I barely had time to think. I just went with what my Oncological surgeon recommended. When I asked about aving a double mastectomy she was very quick to reject this option. She said \"we're conservative these days. Much better to have lumpectomy and whole breast radiotherapy. BMx is overkill.\" I had 2 positive nodes so I had a axillary node clearance followed by chemo. I went for my Radiotherapy consult a couple of months ago and read a heap of journal articles on the subject. After learning about the possible short and long term risks, side-effects and complications, I decided hat radiotherapy wasn't the right fit for me. I made the decision to undergo a double nipple sparing mastectomy instead of the radiotherapy. I also wanted the peace of mind in knowing that both breasts would have their lifetime risk of BC occurence/recurrence reduced. I had my BMx surgery 7 weeks ago. One week before my op I had another mammogram and ultrasound just to check. It all came back clear.... The histopathology results from the breast tissue that I had removed during my BMx told a very different story.... Although my L breast, which had had the lumpectomy last year, was free of cancer cells, my R breast had a 5.5cm x 3.5cm high grade DCIS! I couldn't believe it! How could they have missed a cancer almost as big as a hen's egg on the mammogram/ultrasound? The Dr's now tell me that it happens from time to time and that mammograms and ultrasounds aren't 100% accurate. Great. I understand that no test is fool proof but to miss a tumour this large??? I dodged the biggest bullet of my life with the decision to choose a double mastectomy over radiotherapy. Maybe it's incredibly rare for a Radiologist to miss or to make a misdiagnosis of this magnitude but I'm very glad that I made the decision I did. I hope that this helps :-) I wish you all the best.

Perth Drs seem to be reticent about using it. I think cost is the main decider here. What price for peace of mind once a positive diagnosis has been made? The wider public knows that although mammograms don't always work in younger women with denser breast tissue we've been led to believe, in Perth at least, that ultrasound picks up anything suspicious that a mammogram won't. This is then confirmed by FNA. One would think that, in light of the failings of mammogram and ultrasound as accurate diagnostic tools, it would be essential for anyone planning to have a lumpectomy to have a MRI done beforehand to rule out other lesions. I wonder how many other ladies out there have been mis or under diagnosed with ?  ",
