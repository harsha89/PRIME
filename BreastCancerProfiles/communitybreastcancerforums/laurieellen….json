It looks like bruising at the base of the nail bed on about half of my fingers. I know it's going to get worse and I'd rather not have to look at it. So here's the question: is anyone aware of any restrictions regarding wearing nail polish? I'm being extra cautious about germs so I'd apply it myself rather than go to a salon. Just wondering if there's an issue with wearing nail polish",

Since I have four more rounds of chemo to go, I'm just hoping they are not weakened further. So far, just some discoloration on a few fingers. I'll see what they have to say tonight. GingerA - It's amazing how we all experience side effects differently. It's almost as if we're taking different drugs. My third round is May 29th (my halfway point). For reasons I still can't fathom, I was more anxious going into the last treatment. I had some queasiness that didn't last long. And the bone pain was more manageable than the first time. What knocked me out was the fatigue. I slept a lot more in the days immediately following treatment. The daily, gradual loss of hair was too much for me. Even though went from shoulder-length to a bob in anticipation of losing my hair, I couldn't bear it. I did not expect the emotional reaction that watching it fall out was having on me. I decided to cut it all off. It turned out to be the right decision for me. I invested in some scarves. I should have gotten the pre-tied ones. Turns out I have zero scarf tying skills! LOL Maybe I'll get some tips at the Look Good Feel Better session tonight!",

It becomes less severe, but it has become a constant companion. I started seeing an acupuncturist. According the nurses and a couple of patients, she has had good success with relieving the neuropathy and the fatigue. No idea if it will work, but I'm hopeful. At the very least, it's 45 minutes of treatment from a very caring, gentle person in a calming environment. Four down, two to go!",

I understand the frustration and anxiety that accompanies changes in treatment and an uncertain future. When my journey started, I was going to have a lumpectomy and a six-week course of radiation therapy. Easy-peezy. Without detailing every twist and turn, I'll tell you that it ended up being partial mastectomy and six cycles of chemotherapy. To top it all off, I'll have to have a bi-lateral mastectomy by year's end. Like you, I'm surrounded by supportive and loving friends and family. Still, there are times when I have to talk myself into just hauling myself out of bed and starting a new day. All of your feelings are legitimate. It's okay to feel like crap. Honor your feelings. Give yourself permission to be angry, sad, frustrated... whatever. What you're going through is kind of a big deal. It's hard. I encourage you to continue to communicate with these amazingly supportive women in this thread and others in this forum. It has helped me immeasurably. I will keep you in my prayers.",

The first session went smoothly so I'm not sure where this is coming from. My husband says I think too much. Maybe it's the anticipation of the bone pain that's sure to follow? Or fear that this session will be more difficult than the first? Perhaps it's the loss of hair? Even though I got a really cute short haircut in anticipation of this eventuality, I think the nearly constant shedding has begun to weigh on my psyche and emotions. The hair fell out in kind of an orderly fashion, but I do have large bald spots. I have reached the point where I am considering shaving off what's left of my hair.",

Most of my hair loss has been in the past two days. Prior to that, it was only thinning and barely noticeable. Now I'm all but bald in the front and on the top of my head. For some reason, the hair on the back of my head has only thinned so far. I had not been wearing any caps or scarves in the house, but I think I'm going to start (especially since I'm cutting off the rest of the hair later today). I think I'll take GingerA's advice and check out some YouTube videos - I'm a novice at tying scarves. While reading your post, I'm reminded how blessed I am to have a really fine breast cancer treatment center only 10 minutes from home. It means that my support network of friends and family are always close at hand. I'll be sending healing thoughts and prayers your way on Friday.",

The first time there was no change in appetite. This time my appetite is out of whack, but I'm eating small meals because I know I need food. The real struggle is that all of the SE seem to come in waves. One minute I'm tired, the next I'm jittery. One minute I'm hungry the next minute just the thought of food nauseates me.

I'm pretty comfortable wearing makeup, but my main concern was how to address thinning eyebrows. I hope I don't lose them entirely. She showed me how to shape them so they looked natural. I also received OPI nail polish. The cosmetologist said that a regular manicure at a salon is okay as long as you don't let them cut your cuticles. She also advised that even the best salons can't get their pedicure equipment \"sanitized\" so there might be some risk of infection there. Another friend's advice was avoid salons just to be safe. She said, \"If you must go, bring your own utensils.\" I think I'll just polish my own nails. I don't feel like being bothered with a salon anyhow.",
