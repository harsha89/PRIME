I lost my mother to ovarian cancer when I was 15 and my father passed a few years back after having been a survivor for 15 years! It is our attitude that sets us apart and I firmly believe that laughter is the best medicine. My family members battled their personal journeys with such grace that I have no plans than to do the very same thing! Thank you for responding.. I will check in with everyone more often, it is definitely helpful and uplifting to be a part of this loving, understanding group! XOXO",

I have 11 more treatments to go, six of them my boost Tx so CONGRATS to ALL wherever you are in your schedule and journey. I just started seeing the redness and peeling (just a bit) but I definitely can't wear any type of spaghetti string tank top or even the softest of material that goes under the armpit area, if I'm just in a soft tee, I'm good! I've been using the Miaderm since it's free at the RO office and my husband is with a compounding pharmacy and they have come out with a new rad relief cream specifically for radiation burn and dermatitis that is working really well. I'm surprised at the fatigue I'm feeling though. I'm 43 and usually VERY active and although this is nothing compared to chemo; I am sometimes tired after being awake for only an hour in the morning.. that's just crazy to me. And I am not a big drinker by any means but I have celebrated a best friend's birthday and a few other occassions with close friends and had one, SMALL cocktail or wine... and it seems the next day I am extra fatigued.. can anyone relate to this?? I can easily give up the happy hour and I have had a neighbor say when she had radiation five years ago, she would get physically sick if she had a drink/beer during her rad tx. Again, prayers and best of luck to everyone. I am also Triple Negative so although I don't have to \"deal with\" hormone therapy, it scares me. I am looking forward to being done with cancer treatments seeing as I have been fighting actively since September 2012 but when the last day of rad comes, I feel like I am going to feel like \"what now.\"? Just pray cancer never comes back? I am as uplifting to my friends and fellow fighters as this site's Cindy is but I definitely have that feeling of just.. \"wow, I have no more to do as of May 9 other than live my life and enjoy every moment even more than I always have\"... and I am a total EVERYTHING IN MODERATION girl... the coke / dessert sugars that we are told to avoid do not break down like other cells do so we are not giving ourselves cancer by enjoying a little of the sweet stuff and thankfully I love fruits and veggies just as much so don't beat yourselves up! We have fought like girls and have WON! Peace to all.",
