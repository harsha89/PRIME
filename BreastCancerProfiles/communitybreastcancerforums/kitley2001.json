Right breast has a cluster of calcification, increased since previous mammo  last Sept., size is up to 0.5 cm. Ultra sound suggested fatty cells in left breast, likely atypical lipoma..no mention of right breast. Mag views of rt breast agree with first mammo, no BIRAD noted, and mammotone guided biopsy will be done next week.  The mag view was on left breast, not right...wth????? Reports are blowing me away, as at the time of testing only the left  breast was mentioned, and area was inner breast, now say outer right  breast to be biopsied.  Sure hope they have it right. They did mag mammo of left breast, not the right.  I will call on Monday so they can review before Thursday biopsy...thinking maybe a typo??? So here I wait with the rest of you...lol.

I kinda figured that and guessing now that the mag mamo was done on the left side to double check the lump I found that they think is nothing.  Maybe didn't mag the right breast as increase of calcifications warranted a biopsy anyway?  Can you tell me ...some calcifications are called micro clusters and some are not.  Does that depend on the size and number of them?",

I even slept well last night.  The procedure really went smoothly and the radiologist thought there was a good chance it would be b9.  They went over my three reports, said they were all typos and would amend them.  They showed me the actual mammos of both breasts to put my mind at ease.  Now I wait 7 to 10 business days. ",
