Stage II is also a tumor that is 2 - 5 cm and has or has not spread to the lymph nodes.  Stage I is less than 2cm and has not spread to the nodes.  You Will lose your hair if you have chemo which I suspect you will.  The drugs used to treat BC make you lose your hair.  Unfortunately, younger women often have more agressive ER- PR- (hormone receptor negative) cancers.  These types of cancers generally require chemo.  Radiation is used for most BC and DCIS. Mastectomy is an option if you dont want radiation but depending on your lymph node status you may need radiation regardless of surgery. Medullary is a type of BC.  It does not make your diagnosis any worse.  You have Ductal Cell Carinoma and Medullary Cancer.  ",
