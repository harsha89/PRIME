Now, my doctor has told me to speak to a surgeon regarding a biopsy and/or drainage of the cysts, as i am in CONSTANT pain, as well as, i have surges of pain. I have a lot of Cancer in my life right now, a lot of loved ones going through much more than myself. Am I even justified in worrying about myself? That being said, I will be looking to see the same answers from your questions. I am sorry Lulu, that you are going through the same \"not knowing\" that I am. It's so frustrating. I will be praying that your results are all benign.  I would also like to know thoughts on if I should ask my dad, who I do not speak with (family drama wit the step mom), if BC runs in our family? Does it even matter at this point? I am already taking the necessary steps to finding out what's wrong with me, is this really that important?  Thanks!! Jo",
