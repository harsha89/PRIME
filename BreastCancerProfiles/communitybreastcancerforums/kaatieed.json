She did a breast exam, asked a ton of questions, and then left to get another doctor. He seemed concerned, said that it wasn't a cyst (I don't know why), and said he said the likely possibilities are either a fibroadenoma (he told me to \"google it\") or breast cancer, but \"since I'm only 22 it's not breast cancer\".  It was a strange appointment. But now I have an ultrasound on Monday, but I'm not sure what they're looking for or what comes after that. So all together, I might be more confused than I was to begin with :P",

      "Content": "kaatieed wrote: Hey everybody. A few months ago I noticed a patch of red flaky skin on my left breast, which seemed like dry skin but wouldn't go away when mousturized. I started poking around and was kinda caught off guard when I found a fairly large lump near the top of that breast. It's not quite moveable, has one smooth (but dimply/bumpy?) edge and one edge that is not smooth at all. Kinda oblong shaped, around half the length of my finger. It's firm, but not painful. However, the tissue under my breast, not near the lump, is quite painful to touch, almost sore. I waited a few months and checked every few days, and the lump never changed with my cycle (but has gradually gotten sliiiiightly larger since I found it), the red/brown patches are still there, and there is still pain at the bottom of my breast. I'm an a-cup with very non-lumpy breasts, so the lump is really noticeable.  I'm trying not to google anything, and I know I can't be \"diagnosed\" on a forum, but I was just looking for some advice and feedback. I'm terrified of doctors and will do anything to avoid going, but this is beginning to worry me. I'm ready to make a doctor appointment, but I'm afraid that the second I walk in they'll say \"oh, you're only 21, it's probably just a cyst or something, come back in a year if it's still there\". I'm hoping it IS just a cyst or something not-so-worrisome, but I'm afraid that I'll be dismissed outright, end up having no idea what's wrong, and not have the courage to go back or seek a second opinion. So I was just wondering: has anybody else had similar symptoms? What sort of things should I tell and ask the doctor? How can I avoid being immediately sent away because of my age? Should I be worried? Any advice would be greatly appreciated -Katie Log in to post a reply",

I'm going to drop by the office tomorrow to make an appt., usually the wait time is no longer than a week to see somebody, so that helps my nerves. Somebody mentioned that I should write all my symptoms and questions on a piece of paper to bring with me so that I don't get too nervous and forget stuff when I'm there. Thank you for the encouragement!  I had to google masstitis since I've never heard of it before, I don't have any of the redness/fever/heat that the pages have mentioned. So of course, I did what I shouldn't be doing and clicked every link I could find, and the number of things that it COULD be is overwhelming. But at least I know that there ARE a number of other things it could be, so thank-you! Also, hypothetically, how much of a role does family history play? My mother doesn't have cancer, but my dad was diagnosed with stage III colorectal cancer a few years back, my cousin in her late thirties is currently fighting breast cancer, and it looks like my grandmother is about to be diagnosed with lung cancer. Should I inform my doctor about this, or will they ask?  thanks again for the encouragement! I'll post any updates here as I find out, I don't really have anybody to talk to so it feels good to clear my head and type it all out here!",
