Felt like a leper. But I'm on the mend and I'll focus on that.  Here's the kicker. DH is getting an MRI today for his knee which he blew out pushing the car through the snow last Wednesday.  What a pair we are!  JH you look great with your buzz! As for hair.. I had mine shaved Saturday and it was a relief.  My hair had just gotten so limp and the shedding was too much.  Now it's nice and smooth.  Showed it off to the 3 grandkids last weekend and my 9 yr old grandson declared I looked younger ... go figure.  The 4 yr old asked me to put on a bike helmet -- I did -- and he said I looked really cool.  Love those kids.  ScienceGirl   I see you went with the scarf to work.  I'm going in to work first time tomorrow in the wig.  I think it looks fine.. that's what folks say .. but like you said, I feel like it's not me.  I wore it out to the store today and I think everyone is noticing.. I know there is no way anyone could possibly care so I think it's just a matter of getting used to it.   That's what I hear from friends who have been through this. At least it's warm in this very cold season!",

Had to leave the car at a nearby school and hike the last half-mile because of fallen wires.  Survived that and had to turn around yesterday morning for second tx of AC.  Doing much better this round.  Port worked well and ONC prescribed Emend this time before chemo and added a lot of saline with the cytoxan to cut down previous SEs.. Worked like a charm. Much less nausea yesterday I am happy to report. She also prescribed Ativan for breakthrough nausea and sleep at night -- soemthing to counteract the Decadron.  The Compazine I used last time didn't help me with nausea but this combo is doing great.  Two approaches I've used so far -- I've been fasting before each session (though without a baseline of not fasting I'm not sure if it is contributing to my lighter SEs) -- but I'm going to keep it up.  Also, I started weekly accupuncture sessions right before my breast surgery.  It's been great for me -- a real help through this ordeal.  On day 5 after the 1st tx, I had an accupuncture session and slept for 10 hours straight, woke up and felt like I left most of the SEs behind.  Final hurdle tomorrow and then kiss this week over -- I'm going to the wig shop for the shave and wig fitting.  Bringing my two daughters for moral support and beauty advice.  I'm 15 days out from first AC and I am shedding like a dog in summer.  I'll be happy to have it off and happy Monday evening when I've got that first day of work as the new me behind me!  Thank you for sharing your first-day-back-at-work-with- wig-or-scarf -or-hat-stories -- they are a real help!  Good luck to everyone going in for the next round.  Got you all in my thoughts!",

It  looks great on the styrofoam mold --but somehow I can't strike the same pose :)  Next week I'll take it back into the shop and they will shave my head and hopefully help us get along together.  Will let you know how that goes. UTMom --Hope your cell count pulls up fast.  Good to hear your story and know what to look out for.  I'm getting the Neulasta the day after every treatment.  First one okay -- just a little achey in the hips and legs.  Claritin seemed to help.. just one more med in the many I am now taking... I really wonder how my body sorts through them all.  Hang in there.",

This is my first post but I've been reading since the start and have just finally found time through appointments etc. to write.  Got through my first AC chemo 1/13 and other than some nausea right afterwards, I'm doing fine. Believe the Anzemet/Decadron has helped a lot.  I also did the pre-chemo fasting regimen MaryMeg described earlier.  Only downside so far .. my veins aren't up to it and I have to get a port before the next chemo 1/27.. oh, well.  Not the worst thing, I hope.  Got my first Neulasta this morning after taking Claritin -- a tip I got from you ladies.  Thank you!  Also got my hair cut shorter in anticipation of the next step. I have my wig  and looks like I will go back to the shop soon  for a shave and a fitting.  I work in a pretty corporate environment -- suits everyday -- hope the wig knows how to behave.   Also kind of interesting that my dog has taken a huge interest in it and watches carefully when I try it on... hope it doesn't end up in his bed some night!  Thank you all for sharing. It is such a comfort to read your posts and know we are all going through this together.   ",

Oncotype score 18.  My hormone receptors are 90%+.  Her 2 -.ONC recommended fairly aggressive dose dense 4 X AC every 2 weeks followed by 4 X Taxol. I had heavy SE's on the AC including Foot Hand Syndrome that resolved into temporary neuropathy. I am afraid that the Taxol which can come with the threat of permanent neuropathy was more risk than the benefit it would confer.  My young agressive ONC not happy but I got a second opinion -- an older doc -- who thought my SEs were significant.  He said lifestyle changes -- lose weight and add daily exercise -- would close the gap on what I might lose from the Taxol.  So that's the way I'm going to go.  I'll have 6 weeks of RADs 5 X week and then go on Tamoxifen.  Working to keep the recurrence at bay should be a good motivator to exercise!  So I guess the treatments have more wiggle room than what  you might expect.",

Oncotype 18.  I did four rounds of AC and had a miserable time.  I had the port but I suffered from all kinds of side effects including hand and foot problems that kept me from walking.  I also had neuropathy not only in my hands and feet but my face went numb.  That's not supposed to be a side effect of AC but it was real. When I read that Taxol can cause permanent neuropathy I did more research.  I found out that in studies analyzing the existing data, Taxol seems to show less  to no benefit who are ER/PR positive.  That study is available on this website.  I emailed one of the prinicipal investigators of the study Daniel Hayes, MD and he told me that they are conducting new studies  still underway to test that theory and without real outcomes I should do the Taxol.  I should mention these results pertain to Taxol only and not the other taxanes. My onco was dead set against me quitting  but I didn't want to risk permanent neuropathy since I seemed predisposed to it from the AC.  So with the medical profession against me,  I quit after the 4 rounds of AC.  I also switched oncologists.  It was 100% my decision and I know lots of folks disagree with me.  I'm one year out from treatment (also did the RADS) and I still wonder and worry but I have gotten the feelng back in most of my body and I've stayed busy eating better, doing lots of exercise, and trying to cut back on stress -- anything to help the odds.  My heart goes out to you.  It's such a hard place to be.  I'm sure lots of folks here will weigh in and tell you to keep going.  But in the end you decide.  Good luck with your decision.",
