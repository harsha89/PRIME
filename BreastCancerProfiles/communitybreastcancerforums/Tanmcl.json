Because of It, I was told that if we did the mastectomy and reconstruction on only the cancer side (right side) that I would still need an implant on the left to try to balance them. Therefore, since I was going under the knife anyway, I had a double mx with immediate reconstruction. They unfortunately could not fit the implant on the right (which I was prepared might happen) so they put in an expander. I will tell you...my left side looks beautiful. I really imagined an awkward boob with scars all over. The scars heal so quickly and I'm so incredibly impressed. And its only been a few weeks! It looks better than before (breastfeeding my little ones had left it's mark haha). My right side looks fine too...awkward shape with an expander but once swapped for implant should be fine. In my case, my margins came back positive so May 9 I'm having the expander removed in an attempt to get more tissue removed. I haven't heard of many ladies having to go back for more surgery after mastectomy...lucky me I guess :( I just wanted to reach out to let you know that you'll be just as beautiful after all this! Luv and prayers!",
