    "Content": "lostmymittens wrote: Hello everyone,  I posted about my one breast being swollen for many months on end, and the breast surgeon said the MRI results looked normal.   On this same swollen breast, there has always been a hint of an indentation at about 6:00.  It is pretty hard to see with my arm down, and only slightly visible with my arm up.  However, if I pull my skin taut above my breast (which lifts the breast up and pulls the skin tight around the lumps in my breast), the dimple is very obvious and easy to feel where it goes in.   Above the dimple, and only when the skin is pulled taut so you can see the dimple well, there is a bulge - one you can see and feel.  The shape of my breast (like a side view) when it is pulled up like this is not round..just bulgy.  If I do this to my other breast (pull the skin taut), the side view is round, it looks normal, and no dimples.  Is this dimple forming just because I'm pulling my skin against whatever lumps are in my breast?  Or is this dimple something that shouldn't be there, no matter what position my breast is in?  Again... I just had an MRI that was \"normal\", but my mom gave me that news, so I don't know what the specifics are yet regarding those results.  Thank you so much for whatever info or insight you can provide me with!
