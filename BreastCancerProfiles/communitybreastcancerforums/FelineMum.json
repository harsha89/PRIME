I'm still waiting on my pathology results, but my BS made it clear long ago that I could have negative lymph nodes (BMX last week showed that I do) and ideal results everywhere else BUT she'd still recommend radiation based on my tumor size - roughly 7 cm. My gut says no radiation. I've been researching potential short- and long-term side effects of radiation and find too few answers and too many stories from women who were misled or whose complications were ignored and/or made worse by ignorance in the medical community. I also haven't found any hard numbers on how much radiation would reduce my risk of future recurrence. But the hypotheticals are interesting: If radiation would reduce your risk by 50% and your risk of recurrence is 3%; then your risk afterward would be 1.5%. Is that significant enough? For me, as a triple negative, my general risk of recurrence and death are higher than other types of BC for the first 5 years and then it drops significantly. Some say if TNs make the 5-year-mark, they're practically home free. If the radiation success numbers are geared more toward 20 year rates than five year rates, it's not that relevant to me. But I need more info and I do plan to meet with a radiation therapist. I know I'm not an expert on cancer. But the strong gut feeling I've had about radiation isn't something I'll just ignore either.",

I pasted below replies to my post about this. Maybe it'll help someone else too. Poster SpecialK: \"The purpose of radiation is to help clear the breast area and axilla post-surgery and prevent local recurrence, and potentially distant recurrence, by killing any errant cells left behind before they have a chance to travel and set up shop elsewhere. That is why there is usually a timeline to start radiation post-surgically. Neoadjuvent chemo can cause some trouble with the radiation timeline if reconstruction is desired. The dilemma is this - hurry with expansion and risk damage by radiating the new recon, or wait and risk damaging the skin and muscle and then not being able to reconstruct with implant based recon due to that damage. Is rads being offered for the positive nodes, the tumor size or location too close to skin or chest wall, or all of those things, or is being offered as another treatment modality because you are TN? What was the size of your positive lymph node? This might dictate what type of rads is needed, specifically to the axilla and/or whole breast, and you can also ask about a shorter course of rads (Canadian Protocol), or a different radiation approach customized to your personal situation. Radiation on reconstruction does come with risk. You may experience tightening of the skin around the implant, or the reconstructed side may sit higher on the chest. Ask both your PS and RO to delineate their experience with how many patients they have who have experienced this type of complication, and how it was handled. One of the ways some plastic surgeons mitigate this is to expand the side to be radiated slightly more to account for the potential shrinkage, so you have a better shot at evenness. Some overfill the expanders, then drain them for the duration of rads, then refill. The problem with waiting to try to expand after radiation is that the skin is less likely to stretch - thus the previous approaches. The failure rate is higher for implant based recon initiated after rads without stretching the skin beforehand - about 50%. So that figure is higher than the complication rate quoted by your PS (15-20%) when expanding prior to rads. If you decide to wait until after rads to attempt recon most PS will wait a minimum of 6 months before attempting, but I would add that post-rads implant recon success has increased with doing some fat grafting to the radiated skin prior to starting expansion and this has helped the skin to stretch and have better vascularity. I had several of these procedures over the course of a year, while having no expander or implant in place, and it made the difference in being able to proceed later with a successful recon on that side. Your recon timeline would be lengthened by fat grafting, and in general by doing post-rad recon, because of the need to let the skin/muscle heal - this is what your PS alluded to in terms of taking less time.\" Another reply from Poster Sam0623: \"Regarding the impact (from rads) to your reconstruction, I also went to 2 Plastic Surgeons. One didn't seem too concerned about radiation damaging the reconstruction. He just said they would delay my implants for about 6 months to allow the skin to heal (So I would be left with tissue expanders for longer). The other PS said the same thing, but if there was damage he would have to use tissue from my back to repair it, however he also said if I delayed the reconstruction completely until after radiation he would have to use the back tissue, so he recommends placing the TEs immediately , allow patients to have the radiation and take the chance you may not have any issues and need the back tissue for repair.\" The whole thread is in All Topics → Forum: Triple-Negative Breast Cancer → Topic: Questions. Too many questions & feeling pressured to commit. My original post was on June 23rd.",

Neither a 3D mammogram or ultrasound could say much about the tumor. Actually, the mammogram couldn't find it. TG I found a lump? A breast MRI gave the only internal info (does that even make sense?). So what we know has been limited. Given all that, a bilateral seemed like a no-brainer. I'm getting TEs. No skin or tissue grafts/harvesting. And apparently I'm too tired right now to say anything else. If my post is gibberish, I place the blame on Chemo brain.",

I've found the suggestions on the thread \"Topic: Shopping/packing/to-do list for surgery + recovery....\" helpful in preparing for surgery. Some of the posters also seem to be women who live alone, so the tips on how to set things up in advance so it's easier to function on your own have really helped me. And there are so many things I never would've thought of. In my case, the available support is very limited. My mother plans to stay over my first night home. Frankly, if it weren't for my cats, I'd ask her not to. My family is very dysfunctional. Being around my mother requires all the self-control I have to avoid saying things I'll regret or take the bait she throws out. My sister actually is helping an aunt who recently had surgery. My sister likely will be back in town by Friday, but she's an alcoholic and I have strict sanity (and personal property) preserving rules about not giving her access to my home without me present. Me out of it from pain and pain meds isn't 'present.' And I can't risk my meds running off without me. I could go on. I'll leave it at hopefully someone will be able to stop in most days for an hour or two. New questions: I keep seeing references to dye injections a day or several hours before surgery, special soaps/showers and other preparations the night before surgery. I'm getting marked up by my plastic surgeon the afternoon before surgery and already have been told I can't bathe after that. My node injection is roughly an hour before my operation is scheduled to start. No one's mentioned special prep to me, although I've been told I'll get a call a day or two before surgery (this Friday) with instructions. Is this different? My plastic surgeon's doing the marking/marker on my chest the day before because of how tight his schedule is the day of my surgery. He's trying to avoid delays. Long story short, my BS just got back from vacay. The plastic goes on vacay Monday. With Chemo first, 3 weeks is the ideal time frame between Chemo ending and surgery. Waiting for another vacay to end puts me well past that. ",

I used cold gloves. They work by decreasing the amount of Chemo meds that go into the fingers. This is important in the extremities because the meds stay there longer due to slower circulation. I started after two cycles because I was getting prickly sensations along with numbness in my hands. The gloves do seem to have helped - no additional symptoms and less of what had started happening. I wish I'd done cold socks because my feet now have mild neuropathy. My BS was okay with cold gloves because the likelihood of cancer in the hands is very slim. Losing my hair sucked. It remains one of the hardest parts of having cancer. I swore I'd never leave the house without at least a hat or scarf; preferably my wig. I've only left \"without my head\" (as I put it) once because I was in a hurry and forgot. My hair started growing back and when it reached about 2 inches, I started wearing wide cloth headbands or scarves across my forehead and around the base of my hairline. I liked it. But after my final cycle, my hair started falling out again. So off to my stylist for another shave. I won't claim it's easy. I will say I got used to it. And my American Cancer Society wig is damn cute. I still get compliments on my new haircut from people I don't see often. I'm not trying to tell anyone what they should do. I'm trying to share the information I have. FWIW.",

Removing my gallbladder was an outpatient, laproscopic (sp?) procedure at a surgery center. I remember the GI saying I'd never miss it, my incisions would heal without scaring and diarrhea was a temporary side effect. Ten years later, I miss my gallbladder; every incision left scars; and Imodium-D is practically a daily necessity. So when my BS says my body doesn't need breasts to function and my mind will have a harder time adjusting ... I think of my gallbladder. Thank you, rljessu for the well wishes. Pillows of all sizes is what a friend recommended - including small ones for under your arms. She said it takes some pressure off the rib cage. I've been getting creative. Breast forms inside a sock = small pillows! I have a ton of throw pillows, so I plan to use them if needed. Other thoughts have been rolling up a fleece blanket and putting it inside a pillow case or using dried beans or rice to make a different type of small pillow. Maybe a Ziploc bag inside a sock, or sewing a pillow cover and filling it. Rice can be microwaved for a warm pillow/neck buddy type of thing. I use a needle and thread to make things like that. I don't know to use a sewing machine. What is the MammaTest? I'd love to know my risk of recurrence if I don't have radiation. I'm going to meet with a radiation therapist after my surgery, but I've had serious misgivings since the start. I'm having a mastectomy. Manual exams can't find any trace of my tumor. My BS hopes this means she'll be removing a dead tumor. One lymph node biopsied positive and was the only place my PET scan and breast MRI detected cancer. But now the BS thinks it may have been residual cells from fluid passing through the node? And that all my nodes may be negative. But she still insists I need radiation, but can't give me numbers or a reason other than tumor size. My prep is no food after midnight; no fluids after 5:30 a.m. That's it. I'm dreading wearing a bra non-stop for 3 months. I have a post surgical garment/cami for the first 2 weeks. That's supposed to be worn 24/7. My insurance only covered one of them, so I have a fanny pack to tuck the drains into when I wash the cami. I hate bras. I can't wait until I don't need them anymore. I'm getting nipple tattoos vs. the surgical procedure that can make a bump that resembles one (can't think of better way to describe) partially so I don't have to worry about showing thru my clothes.

I also have lymphatic channel involvement and no complete pathologic response. As a TN, that's devastating. But I've started on Xeloda (a chemo pill), my TEs are being expanded as planned and after that, I'll have 33 rads sessions over 6 1/2 weeks. I feel lucky that post-op hasn't been too bad. One drain stayed in for a month, and I couldn't even take a shower by myself with the dang thing in b/c of how much it limited using that side. I started doing exercises right away to help with nerve pain caused by a different drain (when in, it kept resting on a nerve). As it turns out, that drain wasn't even working right, so I've had fluids manually aspirated twice. My PS said he rarely puts drains back in. But I'm almost at full ROM now. I just started PT for back probs, but will be getting exercises for preventing lymphedema and helping with rads-related skin stiffness. I did neoadjuvant chemo. My best advice for SE: 1) Mouth sores: Request a script for \"Magic Mouthwash.\" It's a compounded rinse that really, really helps. Most insurance doesn't cover it, but where I am it runs about $25/bottle. It does need to be made by a compounding pharmacy. 2) Nausea: Have prescriptions for anti-nausea meds filled & ready. If it hits you, it will hit hard. If you maybe might be feeling some nausea - take a pill. 3) Hair loss: If you're in the US, the American Cancer Society provides free wigs. Call'em and see where your local wig bank is and who to call for an appointment. Getting your wig trimmed and styled to fit you makes it 100 times more flattering and real looking. I was told that most people are bald within three weeks of their first infusion. In the middle of week two, I had my head shaved after small clumps of hair started falling out. I cut it short before chemo started (from below my shoulders to chin length). For me, this was easier and therapeutic. For tying scarves, try fabric hair bands (pony tail holders) instead of knots or over knots to better secure them. I liked putting a wide fabric head band around the edge of a scarf. It helped keep it in place and I'd add accessories like small broaches or even earrings to the head band. ",

It works and now when I feel the start of that pain, I move my arm ASAP. I'll be doing oral/pill Chemo. The med's called Xeloda. When I googled it, I read the manufacturer's information and started crying because its FDA approved use is for metastatic breast cancer, so I assumed I'd be getting even worse news when I meet with my BS this week. I've had teardrop blood cells in my weekly blood work too, which I knew can be a sign of metastasis. The only explanation I got when I asked about those was they hopefully would resolve themselves. I was so mad I shot off an angry email. Luckily, a nurse called me almost immediately to explain I'm not metastatic. That my BS uses Xeloda off-label for TN and it's used to avoid recurrences or lengthen the time between them. My BS has had very good results with it and gets non-responsive patients referred to her because of that and her very active participation in clinical trials. And while my results weren't what we hoped for, overall they weren't capital B - Bad. My node cancer was very small and contained. Clear/negative margins are wonderful.

It's mainly for holding drainage bags but also acts as a bra. It zips up the front and makes things so much easier. They sell them on Amazon, but my doctor prescribed mine and my insurance (Medicare) covered it. I got it from the same kind of store that sells other mastectomy supplies. I'll be wearing it for a total of 2 weeks, 24/7. The brand is Amoena and it's called a post-surgery front close camisole. I had the injections everyone mentions, but mine were around the circumference of my tumor, not in my nipple. Four total. No numbing cream used and they did sting (more afterward than going in), but it was tolerable. I think by then I'd been given a Valium. My incisions look scary. There's all this skin kinda hanging there and a mish mash of dark bruises and navy surgical marker. Someone mentioned looking kind of puckered. I do too. I do have expanders and had skin sparing ???

I didn't have any leakage on my incision, but my PS's nurse seemed surprised I had no leakage anywhere, not even when my drains were removed. She said spurts of fluid then are common. Instead, my fluid built up inside, causing painful bulges near my right MX incision. The PS basically inserts a suction tube and manipulates it inside me to get out as much fluid as possible. My nurse said that as my TEs get larger, it should push the remaining fluid to where it can be reabsorbed by my body. That worried me! And afterward I'd bleed through the bandages they put on, on my way home. But both PS and the nurse weren't worried and said everyone's different. I swear, if cancer had a slogan, it'd be \"Your mileage may vary.\" I ask lots of questions. I even tell people upfront that I ask questions and if they're not okay with it, to tell me because we're not a good fit. If you're worried, keep asking. At least, that's what I'd do. YMMV",

He does make suggestions, like aloe vera and Aquaphor. But he also said that what someone is most comfortable with or confident in likely will work best for them. Because of the location of my positive node and which lymphatic channels are involved, my left lung will be radiated in three different places. I knew it'd be hit in one place. Three seems like ... way too many. I do need my non-cancer side TE partially deflated. My heart's located close to my chest wall, so I also need to learn the breath holding technique that moves the heart away from the radiation(?). I'll need to go to a larger center for that and also for my mapping. My BS is based at that center and it's where I had chemo, so I'm familiar with it. But the staff told me to practice holding my breath for at least 30 seconds - just pretend I'm scuba diving! Um, the thought of doing that makes me feel panicky. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and I almost drowned as a child. Oddly enough, I've never gone scuba diving. Perhaps because I don't put my head under water. Guess I'll deal with that part later. I made an appointment later this week for deflation. That seems like a fitting word. It's only by 1/3rd and the TE will be refilled once I finish rads. I've been in active treatment since March. If everything stays on track, I'll finish in February 2018. With implants in the Fall of 2018. I'm so tired of CancerLand.",

I meet with one of my ROs on Friday for a pre-rads check-up. I met with this RO's partner in August right after my BMX for a full physical and to discuss my treatment, so I don't know what this meeting is for. I had to wait for my TEs to be filled before returning for any prep work. As of last week, they're done. But my impression from the receptionist is that this is another full physical exam. Um. I just had blood work for a BS appointment this week. Which means I'll also be seeing my BS this week. The main difference is the expanders are filled. I do take Xeloda, but we knew I'd be starting on it back in August. 33 sessions over 6 1/2 weeks is what the RO said in August. He said to expect radiation pneumonia and some permanent lung damage due to the locations being targeted. It's my left side. The RO didn't think my heart would be in the way, but they need to do cat scans to be certain. If my heart's placement interferes, I'll need to go elsewhere because this center doesn't have the right equipment to avoid heart damage. It's an hour from where I live. The nearest one with more advanced machines is 90 minutes/each way. I just want to get started. I'm going to need a few days off at the end of the month and a couple more days in both November and (if it goes that far) December for non-cancer-related medical procedures. I know it's not ideal, but that's life. And I want to move forward with my life. I started out not wanting to do rads at all. But I'm TN and didn't have cPR, so anything that raises my odds of no recurrence is happening. The Xeloda causes sun sensitivity, so my rads \"sunburn\" likely will be worse. I've already got a jumbo size Fruit of the Earth jug of pure aloe vera (with pump!). I remember the RO saying Aquaphor and Eucerin are good too.I have Tom's of Maine sensitive skin soap (unscented beauty bar with chamomile) and I wonder if that will be good for showers? I don't want to give up antiperspirant. I've read it isn't necessary to do so, but not all ROs agree. I come from a long line of people who sweat a lot. I don't want to relive puberty, pit stains or BO. And that's my rambling introduction!",

The RO said it'll take longer to get me into position than for the actual radiation - 2-3 minutes, I think he said. My RO actually has an \"India ink colored tattoo\" (his words) on his wrist to show patients what their tattoos will look like - size and color. He's also 79-years-old and technically retired. Filling in for other RO's sick days and vacation time seems to have become a long-term gig. I think an RO at the center has been having serious health probs. But I hear my RO attends a lot of continuing ed programs, both to meet licensing requirements and because he enjoys learning. (Someone from my BS's office mentioned that when they heard who my RO is.) Still, I feel tired and cranky. An hour drive each way for an update and another exam - I think possibly to see if my TEs are too big/in a bad location. Knowing that 10 weeks of fills could literally go down the drain makes me feel queasy. Mine went high and seem to be on my collarbone. I think they're huge and I know they hurt. Still, I didn't see a sign-up sheet for Easy-Peasy Cancer Treatments and/or Procedures for Quality of Life Afterward. i.e. I don't want to lose my progress and possibly my chance of eventually having implants.

My new dr. got me and my lump at my new patient appointment. She sent me for a mammogram with insurance authorization pending for an ultrasound. She explained that without a mammogram, my health insurance wouldn't cover more diagnostics. The mammogram found nothing. Literally nothing. The ultrasound showed an indistinct blur. Yet I was offered a biopsy that same day. I found out the next day I have TNBC. I also was told it was Good I hadn't had a mammogram before finding the lump because my insurance would have denied further tests anyways due to the negative results, my age and no family history.

My heart's position isn't ideal and apparently this method of not quite filling the lungs and holding for 30 seconds moves the heart enough to take it out of the path of radiation. There's a mouthpiece that measures how much I breathe, when I inhale or exhale (and how deeply for either) and when I hold my breath. I can see it all in \"goggles\" with a computer screen in them. That part's interesting and helped me adjust my breathing in today's practice session. One of the techs said it also helps minimize lung damage. Three areas of my left lung will be radiated in order to reach channels/lymph fluid pathways behind them. My TE can be refilled as soon as I finish radiation. It's the non-cancer side TE. Deflating it means it won't receive radiation and the desired areas are easier to target. Until it was filled and I had cat scans, there was no way to predict if it'd be in the way. I do have to wait nine months to replace the TEs with implants. My PS wants my body to heal completely and says studies show 9 months is optimal.

I've been told no deodorant on the cancer side. Period. I've also read articles on studies that show there's no need to do that. And that feeling disgusting is more harmful than imaginary ... oops, scientifically disproved theories about potential harm. I also was told my skin must be absolutely dry before rads. Um. Before stronger/clinical strength antiperspirants came out, I had issues with visible moisture. i.e. pit stain and pit stank. Questions: 1) What's your experience with deodorant/antiperspirant use during rads? 2) Some of you have mentioned using a lotion a week before starting rads. What lotion? Did your RO give a reason for doing this? I've got pure aloe vera and Aquaphor, and am debating if I should start putting one of those on. 3) For anyone out there who's also had a BMX - did/do you wear a bra during rads? I haven't worn one since before surgery. I'm thinking about buying some men's cotton undershirts. Post-op soreness around my scars was eased by wearing shirts with short sleeves. 4) Boosts: They'll be making a plastic mold of my scars for when I have boosts. I'm used to countless strangers seeing my chest; letting residents do mock exams, having students observe ... but this somehow sounds invasive. I suppose the question is, does that make me nuts? (wry grin) Thanks.",

I never wanted to do rads and the more I learn about my cancer, the less I think it will help me. Many triple negs don't have rads. Our odds of survival are dismal compared to other types of BC. What TNBC responds to is chemo. But only about 50% of the time. I didn't respond. My odds of living five years disease-free, or at all are roughly 50%. Xeloda may bump that up by 15-20%. I haven't found evidence nor has anyone shown me any that rads affects TNBC at all. I feel like I'm hurting my overall health while wasting precious time.",

Everything happened so fast I didn't know about SOs vs. MOs vs. ROs ... When I had a consultation months after surgery, the consultant couldn't figure out why I hadn't had many more lymph nodes removed, why the MSROPITA insisted on X during radiation or why she left the red devil out. So, with my permission (!) he called her. He later told me it was a phone call he'd never forget. But her rationale was she didn't like the red devil's cardiac SE profile. I have no heart probs and a history of normal echos. She believes X enhances rads and for some cancers, it does. Breast cancer isn't one of them. No known benefits with an almost guaranteed increase in severity of SE. And she felt I only needed the sentinels removed because my only known positive node was a sentinel. Guess what's positive now? The consultant recommended I change to an MO - the MSROPITA also was trying to dictate my rads. I put my foot down and refused to start them until the rads w/ or w/o X issue was resolved. But she seemed so friendly and so many people like her! Their lives weren't in her hands. Mine was. She's still winning popularity contests at her employer and likely still telling the patients rude enough to ask questions that their questions are a time-consuming nuisance and demanding apologies when they exceed some imaginary monthly quota of things asked but never answered. MSROPITA = Medical surgical radiation oncologist Pain in the A.. If you're not comfortable. If you can't ask questions or get answers. If a doctor of any type dislikes well-informed patients or literate ones, well, the first phrase matters most, IMHO. My story? It's true. I look back now and want to tell the woman I was then how naive, stupid and pathetic I was. But I also know those things aren't really true. I trusted my oncologist but I still asked questions. Her attitude about that and attempts to shut me down led to more questions. I ignored my gut. That's where I get mad at myself.

Yet when all three of the tumors (at the time) were discovered in April 2018, I was given 6 months or less to live. The only treatment option mentioned was Halaven. My then-MO said it had traditional IV chemo side effects and might give me 3 to 4 more months to live. But with a decrease in QOL I might find unacceptable. I did. My mets were discovered 2/3rds of the way through rads, so I never finished treatment. My RO suspected a local recurrence which a CT scan confirmed. I had my first round of cancer-oriented comprehensive scans since April 2018 last week. The April 2018 CT scan found no liver mets. A PET scan did. After the CT scan, a task force including a surgeon were rounded up in hopes of a good PET that would've been followed by node removal for the recurrence. No such luck. But my CT scans report from last week (chest, abdomen, pelvis) keeps referring the April 2018 scan like it found liver mets and making comparisons. The report says there are numerous new lesions on the liver, especially in the dome area. Is a lesion the same as a tumor? How on earth don't I know that? I thought the results were pretty good. I went 10 months without chemo and 6 months without any treatment, so I didn't expect miracles. My bone scan was 100 percent negative for mets. But my MO seems to think the increase in lesions means the Doxil I'm on isn't working anymore. I've only had four infusions and I feel so much better! I do have my days but it's mainly mood, and the scans found a severely enlarged thyroid and goiter. With a family history of thyroid disease, I know it can affect moods and energy levels. The MO thinks tm are the bible of chemo success. Mine went down, then nearly doubled, then nearly tripled. I know I've read that antigens and such aren't good indicators for everyone. That some MOs don't use them at all. I don't have relevant scans or even a recent PET to compare the now to, so I fear a blood test could take away a drug that I think works. But what do I say? I cooked last weekend and I'd stopped cooking for months? I'm doing my own laundry again after more than a year of farming it out? I'm coloring my own hair again vs. going to a salon? Would a very academic-oriented male MO understand the significance of those things? And WTH is a lesion?",

That rads affect the body in so many ways, it takes a long time to heal completely. While knowing it'll likely be nearly a year before I have implants can be frustrating, I'd rather it be done right. And just once. My PS recommends arm and shoulder stretches, especially when lymph nodes have been removed. My RO is recommending 25 treatments with a bolus. But no boosts. TG. I want to have some skin left. I've already practiced the deep breath hold (aka inspiratory breath hold). I'm still nervous about rads near my heart, but glad there's a technique that aims to minimize negative effects. Start date unknown. I need one expander completely deflated before scheduling mapping. Bye-bye 65 CCs of volume. I'll be refilled after rads. The way it's been explained to me is that the rads beams come in at an angle across my chest and the non-cancer side expander would get hit. The expander itself should be fine, but skin damage and reconstruction complications could occur. It also could make it harder to be precise if beams refract off the expander. I can't argue with the logic. Something that occurred to me late in the game: If you're not getting answers to your questions, find someone who will answer them. I had one rads treatment in late November but still could NOT get the questions I needed answered or sometimes even acknowledged. When I was called time-consuming for having soooooo many questions, I went for a second opinion. And got my answers along with the unsolicited recommendation that I change oncologists. I am so glad I listened to myself and my gut. Please listen to yourself. And honor what you hear. ",

Cut it open in the back - a straight line from the bottom hem to the collar. Sew ribbons on at the collar and a few inches below to use as ties. Or use Velcro. Voila! An inexpensive alternative to a hospital gown. Tip: Turn the shirt inside out and use a measuring tape and pen to mark the center and where to cut to have a straight line. I have my materials - all from a thrift store. I found much nicer T-shirts in the men's section. I have a blue Cookie Monster face, a touristy one and one with tattoo style flowers and skulls. Washed in hot water, they're now waiting for me to measure, cut and hand sew on some ribbons. A general tip for regular hospital gowns and this type: If it ties in the back, tie the ties before you put it on. For many, putting it on like a shirt is easier than trying to tie that's something behind you. YMMV",

But everyone is different and it's hard to predict these things and no on can really say because .... I sometimes think cancer's motto is, \"Your mileage may vary.\" Neuropathy: The supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid is recommended for it. Cold gloves and cold socks can give relief. And if used during chemo, may prevent it. I'm still exhausted from Xeloda. A month after stopping, my hand-foot syndrome can still make walking more than usual painful. Since I did pretty much next to nothing while on it, walking more than usual doesn't take much. It's frustrating.

Still, skin care and dos/don'ts for similar areas varies so much. I was given handouts recommending Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera and Aquaphor for moisturizing and Dove soap for bathing. And told to moisturize once daily at first and then more if needed later. I asked about moisturizing immediately after treatment. Sure, fine. But before bed is what's recommended. And try to eat 70 grams of protein daily. Shaving? Not a word said. But I was told that hair loss in the targeted area is common. I'm shaving for now but gently. I actually do it in front of the bathroom mirror so I don't drag the razor where it's not needed. The only thing said about deodorant is that ones with aluminum may irritate my skin. But what I use is up to me. I read in Glamour that Native Deodorant is an aluminum-free one that actually absorbs moisture and odors (with arrowroot powder). Proctor & Gamble recently bought it from the small company that made it, so coming to a supermarket near you in the future? The X-rays I have every treatment are done in the treatment room. All the equipment's there. I don't move unless they need to adjust my position. My understanding is it's primarily done to make sure the alignment is perfect. First, my tattoos are lined up with laser lights. Then X-rays are taken. Then I wait until someone says we're starting. It's uncomfortable but not unbearable. I'm doing a lot of stretching and physical therapy exercises daily. I also insist in getting on and off the table in a way that's least likely to aggravate my spine. I'm polite but I don't budge on what I need to avoid pain. If it's as simple as having someone help me on my right side and not grab my left arm or shoulder, I think it's 100% reasonable.

I price checked on Amazon and it was about $18 there. I have left side BC. That's the main reason my RO is having me do deep breathing. My targeted area also crosses my breast bone and is supraclavicular. I'm fine with minimizing the risks and it also distracts me from the process. I've had two simulations with deep breathing, a deep breath evaluation and a training session. I use a huge mouthpiece and my nose is pinched shut. I also wear \"googles\" with a computer screen instead of lenses. I can see my breath there as a chart. I breathe until my inhales and exhales match the desired pattern and then wait for the cue to hold it. A tech told me to put my tongue on the roof of my mouth when holding my breath and it's amazing how much easier that is.",

After an exam, he told me \"Congratulations on one year NED.\" I asked what NED meant: No Evidence of Disease. I think a lot of people have different dates for their anniversaries. Like, when they suspected something was wrong; the day of surgery; when all treatment ended. I've seen the term \"mammoversary.\" (although I don't know which milestone it refers to). I acknowledge the day I found a lump. But I use Dx date as my 1 year, 2 years ... date. I'm glad it sounds like your rads are going well. I have back problems too. I'm on my back but with a cradle that supports my neck and keeps my arms in position. I also have started being vocal about how I need to be helped backward and then back up when on the table. I realized that if on a bad back day someone offered me a hand to get out of a chair, I'd tell them how to best help me. The wrong help too often hurts. Right before Thanksgiving, I'd done everything including a dry run and one treatment. But the dry run was horrible and when a machine malfunctioned, I was left on the table for at least an hour without anyone checking on me. The mouthpiece is attacked to a mechanical arm and the googles are taped to it; my feet are rubber banded together; there's a foam wedge under my knees and I had just had carpal tunnel surgery on my non-cancer side arm. i.e. I couldn't move, speak or see. I was in a lot of pain during and afterward. But I said nothing and even came in the next day. The day after that, I had an emergency appointment at my orthopedic practice that was followed by two more appointments in less than two weeks. My saying nothing after the dry run or the next day was used as \"proof\" that I was exaggerating. No one expected me to come back. The severe back probs lasted for about 3 weeks. And then it was the holidays and I got a second opinion at U of Michigan in early January. I started Xeloda (oral chemo for TNBC) in August, so I chose to finish that before resuming rads. Meg101, you couldn't be more right when you say to be your own advocate. No one else can do that as well as you can. You know yourself and your body better than anyone. Period. You are the expert on you. Ask lots of questions. If the answer doesn't make sense, say so. If you can't get an answer, ask someone else. If your gut says \"No!\" listen to it. I wish I had listened to mine sooner. My chemo didn't include \"A\" just C + Taxotere because my former SO (who says she's also an MO) saw no need for it. I didn't know that until months later, but something always seemed off. Questions and concerns were treated like the silly worries of a silly girl or absolutely everything will be just fine. This time, I'm approaching rads as an active participant who has fully functional vocal cords. When my spine flares up, I have muscle spasms from my lower back to left hip down to the toes on my left foot. Rads isn't possible if that happens. If needed, I'll happily make the consequences of aggravating my back probs clear. But I hope I don't need to. Um, thanks for letting me vent!",

He said that the same exact type of BC with a single degree difference in Grade or Stage will have a different treatment. As to approaches, I asked him about my bolus. It's made of a lightweight plastic/wax combo that was molded onto me while warm and left to cool. I've read other women describing their bolus as a damp towel. My RO said there are many different approaches and it's often an institutional preference more than anything. I have brain fry today, so bear with me. I get X-rays every session. I was told that up front. They take one or two to make sure I'm correctly aligned. Some days, I feel the bed being remotely adjusted afterward. I'm not concerned about the extra radiation. I'd rather that than risk damage to my heart or lungs. My RO scared me _bleep_less yesterday. I had my weekly checkup and near the end of it, he mentions that he's looking into additional surgery for me to remove more nodes. He says it like I already know this, mentioning a consultation I had elsewhere in January. ??? My consult confirmed that my surgeon should've taken out more nodes during my BMX but given my biopsy, breast MRI and PET scan results, there was no reason to suspect additional positive nodes. I get back to my room yesterday after my checkup and just want to take a nap. My phone starts ringing. It's an unfamiliar number and whoever it is calls repeatedly without leaving a message. I turn my phone off and get some sleep. When I wake up, I've forgotten my phone's password. Stress maybe? Eventually, I figure it out. The RO's receptionist had left a vm saying the RO was trying to reach me. He was the repeated hang-ups. He called from his private line. It's after 5 pm. The phone banks are shut down for the day. I didn't sleep much last night. When I talked to him this morning, that pressing, incredibly urgent reason he needed to talk to me less than two hours after seeing me was ... to tell me he wants me to get a CAT Scan. Um. I was back in there today and I bet the clerical or nursing staff could've handled telling me that just fine. In fact, probably better than he did. On the upside, I had a checkup today with my MO. My arm pit was thoroughly examined and nothing was found. The RO thought it felt \"bumpy.\" And I don't think the MO's nurse practitioner (who met with me) was happy to find out from me that the RO is saying I need surgery. He should've informed the MO and that's a surgeon's decision, not his. Her advice was that the CAT Scan can't hurt but don't decide anything without consulting a surgeon, my outside consult and hopefully the MO as well. 10/25. I'll be halfway done on Friday. Bright red, feeling tight and tender. But with snow predicted for overnight and the rest of the week, at least taking it easy shouldn't be too hard. ",

Part of the sample will be sent to Foundation One for tumor genetic profiling, which is different than regular genetic testing. I guess some tumors have distinct mutations that may help with treatment. It's a needle biopsy. I was told I'll be sore where the needle pierces a muscle on its way to the liver, but I'll mostly notice it if I bump the entry point or move in a way that affects the muscle. Right now, I'm finishing up my coffee before the no fluids period begins. Spring has sprung in Michigan. I'm enjoying the sun's reappearance while watching the last pile of snow in a nearby parking lot slowly melt away.

Back problems, being on Xeloda (type of oral chemo) and too many questions caused me to push the brakes and get a second opinion. I'm glad I did. So although I've already been mapped, tattooed (tiny dots that look like I poked myself with a blue ink pen), did my simulation and had one treatment; I need to do almost everything over. My plastic surgeon refilled my non-cancer side expander that was completely deflated for rads. Now I have an appointment on Tuesday to get it deflated again. I'll probably hear tomorrow when my mapping is. I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed. I'll be driving 120 miles round trip daily. My support network is limited and I'm more emotionally tired of feeling like a burden than I am physically tired. And insensitivity is driving me nuts. As an example, I finished six months of chemo two weeks ago. Since chemo stopped, I look smaller because I'm less swollen and bloated. I'm actually down two clothing sizes. I've only lost 3 pounds since then (but I have been busting my butt since November to eat better and move more). All everyone has to say is how much better I look now that I've lost weight. Saying that what they're actually seeing is the impact chemo had on my body falls on deaf ears. And how about how much better I feel now vs. my size? Anyways, I've stocked up on pure aloe vera, emu oil and Aquaphor. My rads onc said emu oil is fine to use. I like how well it moisturizes without the greasiness of Aquaphor. My aloe is in the fridge. I've been told that deoderant with aluminum is up to me, but it may irritate my skin. Many people have said that moisturizing immediately after treatment makes a huge difference and to bring moisturizer with me to apply in the dressing room. My Super Clavicle will be radiated. I'm triple negative so every bit helps. Without rads, the odds my cancer will recur in the next two years is 50%. Rads could decrease that to 30%.",

I was told today she was out-of-town and still is, but somehow she was at the tumor panel that reviewed my case. I also had to \"manage\" my news. It comes with many questions and right now, very few answers. I've also learned the hard way that asking my immediate family to stay quiet until I've had a chance to tell people myself never works. So, preemptive email. BUT in good news, I now have a Nurse Navigator. And a cancer social worker. And validation on some of my feelings about my former SO/MO/Etc as well as new information on how that onc failed to follow protocols and standards of care. It doesn't change what happened, but hearing that I wasn't nuts and did everything I could, helps. It looks like I'll be having surgery and then more chemo. Third time's the charm? Triple negative breast cancer is called chemo-sensitive or chemo-receptive because it often fails to respond to other treatments. With zero hormonal involvement, many breast cancer drugs and treatments like hormonal therapy have no effect. TNBC is a hot research topic worldwide. This strange bastard cancer doesn't recognize geography, race, diet, environment, etc. Its survival rate is much lower than other BCs. The biggest risk factor is being a younger woman. My last rads session was Wednesday. I'm getting really sore in a couple areas that also feel tight - like my skin is too tight. I'm keeping aloe and Aquaphor on them, plus taking Tylenol. No blisters or sores. My skin looks like it's brown with a coat of red painted over the brown. The worst area has what looks like spider veins. Anyone else have something like this?

Any doctor who feels your concerns about very real orthopedic issues are irrelevant or unimportant needs to be informed that they are NOT. I noticed early on that oncologists tend to think that non-cancer health problems - literally any problem - is nothing compared to cancer. I've been told that the reasons I'm on SSD are unimportant. Well, they were important enough to end my career and my ability to be financially independent. Etc. Maybe it's time to call your ortho doc. Or get another ortho specialist on board. If you haven't gotten spine injections before, those may help. I believe there are hip ones too. But if it were me, I'd be asking about things like quality of life and pain management.

Long story shorter, the RO now says he was quoting the CO's report to tell me the CO doesn't think I need surgery. Huh? RO said the opposite last week and then assured me it was true when I replied that no one's ever mentioned surgery before, and then he asked if so-and-so was still my surgeon (and took my blank stare and incoherent babble as a yes)? And now claims to never have done so? Blech. RO apparently forgot that he asked my health insurance co. to authorize a global referral to the surgeon. The insurance company mailed me a copy of its approval. That arrived Saturday along with an outside agency's approval of the CT scan that the RO wants. RO told me I need a CT scan on April 3rd. The approval letter was postmarked April 3rd. Does anyone else's insurance company move at the speed of sound, especially on routine matters? (face palm) I'm getting the CT scan. But the RO has completely destroyed my trust in him. This is a doctor who did an \"exam\" yesterday through my T-shirt to justify his actions. He insists he can feel \"nodular activity.\" I don't even know what that means. In February, he declared me disease free. What's changed? If there's something in my rads' X-rays that concerns him, he should tell me that. My mother thinks it's \"refreshing\" he took \"took initiative and acted upon his beliefs.\" I think he's a slick liar who abused my trust. I have 10 treatments left.
