She said it is very painful too. She went on to tell me that she noticed a few months ago but since she did not have insurance she did not go to the Dr.!!! She really makes me mad because I have been begging her to go for a mammo since I was DX'd. She said it almost feels like an infection she had while breast feeding a few years ago, however she has no fever which was one of the symtoms of the infection she had back then, plus she is no longer breast feeding. I am so worried, has anyone heard of this type of painful lump in the nipple area being BC????  I just can't bare the thought!!  Thanks for any info you can provide.

I went to her before I lost my hair in preperation. She told me it will typically happen right before your 2nd treatment which was 3 weeks for me. She was right on target. I did everything to be gentle on my hair so I could keep it longer.....in hindsight I realize that was silly, it was going no matter what I did. I now have a short little \"do\" and it is really cute. It came back super curly. It has been fun to work with. Have faith and know it is ONLY temporary. God bless sister!!     ",
