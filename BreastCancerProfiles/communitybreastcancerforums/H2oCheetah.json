My mom is on her way!! @melissa normally I go to most appointments by myself spent pretty much this whole year in GYN office trying to figure out why I'm having issues down there cried in their arms as we talked about me having a hysterectomy to solve my issues. I went to my initial US by myself figured it'd be a 20 min appt and I'd be in and out I spent three hours there by myself part of it sitting in that lovely cape in a freezing room just wishing I had someone to lean on. I am totally happy that it worked out that he gets to go with me. The Drs did reassure me id be able to drive but at this point it's an emotional thing I feel like I've been through the ringer this year",

Thank you for the reassurance about them not just changing like that. I think I'm so concerned about that 1because I feel like it's doubled since Friday (but that could be my mind being overactive) but also I was concerned because of the speed at which things happened on Friday I went in expecting an ultrasound and left after having an US, mammogram and scheduled for biopsy it was just such a whirlwind. I don't think I've really processed everything. I cry sometimes, I'm strong sometimes, and other times I just try to ignore it.",

Part of me is scared they're going to change their minds and want to put me out to take the whole mass (I feel like it's grown significantly since Friday). I only have to wait three more hours before I leave but that feels like a lifetime away. I made myself an outfit for today but the words ended up pulling to the wrong side and now I'm not as excited about itðŸ˜” Oh well. I will make it through today but for now I need to convince myself to eat Log in to post a reply",
