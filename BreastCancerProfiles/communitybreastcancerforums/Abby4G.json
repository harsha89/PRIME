    "Content": "Jan 29, 2018 06:51AM - edited Jan 29, 2018 06:53AM by Abby4G Hello Ameli01, it's good to know that there's someone from the third country with me here who understands the frustrations we experience here. I started my chemo on 13rd Jan and will be going in for the 2nd round on 3rd Feb. Have been working to keep my blood levels up. My 1st chemo wasn't that bad. I suppose to receive herceptin for her2+ BC but won't get that because it's out of my reach both financially and physically. Can you beat that? Will do chemo and go in for radiation and wait to see. It's all in God's hands. Wishing us all the best. ",
