I had my mastectomy in June 2010, followed by 4 months of chemo (ACT), then 33 radiation treatments, final exchange surgery in May 2011, started the 5-yr Tamoxifen regime.  Last summer at this time I thought that the treatment and more so \"being a patient\" would never end. It seemed hard to believe that I'd be hiking, running, traveling, just being MYSELF again, but of course all that did happen and now it almost feels like a bad dream that happened long ago.  I found it really helpful to read through these discussion boards whenever I had any questions on any subject. Side effects, treatment options, info about hair regrowth, sexuality, exchange options.  So, this is a belated thanks to everyone whose messages and advice I've read, and a note of encouragement to those just starting down this road. Hang in there!!!! ",
