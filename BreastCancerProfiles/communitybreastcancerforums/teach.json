I had clear mamo's and had a breast reduction in march 07.  The bios came back dcis in the right breast.  A quick trip to a surgeon and a digital mamo revealed no disease process going on in the breast.  Two weeks later a knot appeared on the right side of my neck - now a return trip to the surgeon, a bios and wow 5cm tumors in the nodes all poorly diff. and triple neg.  No other metst. found in my body, so the onc recommended chemo asap. I started c/a chemo the first of june 07 -  4 rnds of c/a every two weeks.  These went ok for the first 3, the 4th result in two trips to the hosp for dehydration. Well I made it to stage 2 of chemo and that is 12 rounds of taxotere on a weekly basis.  I currently just finished round 7 so just 5 more to go.  Major problems are dehydration, dry eyes and swelling in my right breast and arm.  I drink the 64oz of liquid a day but still dehydate.  I handle the bone and breast pain with oxyncodone.  I am starting to lose appetite and energy.  I hope I can dig up enough to finish this course and get healthy again.  Depression is starting to eat at me, I am taking effexon(sp) and ativan for that special down periods.  It seems to help. Well I finally got some of this off of my mind.  anyone out there wanting to comment?  Hope all of you are doing well and getting better - on to the finish. teach",
