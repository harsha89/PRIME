Of course, I'm not trained, but it didnt show either red or blue on it, just the tissue surrounding it. :-). I had my biopsies yesterday and unfortunately the doctor was busy and she ran out of the room as soon as she was done, so I didn't get to ask questions. But, the stinker? She had told me if it wasn't cancer, it might be a hematoma. I asked her if it was a hematoma when she took it out and she said no. So, that's not too reassuring!!! I'm really hoping she will call me tomorrow with results. That's weird about your cyst and your blob! Mine were both right next to each other, too. :-). She told me she got them both out. This waiting is killing me!!",

I would definitely complain AND go somewhere else and get these things done right! The age thing makes me so mad. Why on earth do they think that 1.5 years somehow has protective magical powers?!? In England, the ladies there run into that with Pap smears. You aren't allowed to get one until you are something like 25, even if you are having symptoms! It's crazy. And women are dying because of it. I think age should be taken out of the equation on medical tests, period!!!!!!!! I finally got my results this morning...the cyst that kept running away and ended up solid is an apocrine cyst, totally benign. The Eye of Sauron is an inflamed, dilated, thick crud filled milk duct. According the the internet, those things like to mimic cancer, but aren't. There was no atypia or malignancy found in either on of my samples!! So I'm clear! And happy. And exhausted from over three weeks of stressing over this! I really hope you can get someone to take you seriously and figure out what's going on. I wish you well and many many positive thoughts and good things are coming your way!!!",

No idea the others were even there until I had the mammo and the US! I agree with you about pushing for the biopsies. It's so much better to know something is nothing than to miss something sinister because they though it was nothing! I'm just really hoping the solid cyst doesn't run away again. She said she can't chase it for the biopsy like she could with the fine needle because the probe does too much damage. It's a one shot deal. If she misses, that's it. I don't know what happens then if that's the case! My breast is still very bruised and sore from last week, so I'm dreading the taping down and the pressure they are going to need to use to get the sample. Ugh! I hope yours come back clean, too!!!!! And, yes, we can wait together! :-)",

Something about someone in the MRI machine and needing her right away to read something. She told the chick she was in the middle of a biopsy, so it will have to wait a couple of minutes. She got done and she was gone. The tech got me cleaned up and bandaged and re-mammoed and I didn't see the doc again before I left. It was really bad timing for sure. This doc has usually spent a huge amount of time with me, so I think that situation was unusual for her. It bugs me, too, when they are in too much of a hurry. You have no idea!!! About risk facors? I have pretty much zero. No family history, first live birth at 20, breastfed for over two years, periods started at 13. I'm 46, so I may be getting up there in age, but I think that's still below the risk level. ;-). I pray and hope yours come back clear, too. Thanks for the good mojo! I'm still waiting (sigh) and I can use it!! :-) Momwriter- that's good news that your solid \"cyst\" was a fibroadenoma! I'm hoping that's what mine is, too, even though I'm way over 30 and I think most of those happen in women under 30. I'm definitely more worried about the eye looking one! About your uterine US, I hear ya about all the false positives. It makes things way scarier than they need to be! I actually had the opposite problem with a false negative. My Pap smear came back negative, so my doc told me there was no way my symptoms were cancer, even though I had ALL the symptoms of cervical cancer!! She told me it was stress and sent me home. A couple months later I could no longer take the bleeding, so I went in for a D&C. She never got past my cervix because it now had a golf ball sized tumor in it. It had grown that much in 2 months! So, go for your US, a false positive is WAY preferable to a false negative, know fibroids are very very common, and yes, early detection is very important. I wish you well!!!!",
