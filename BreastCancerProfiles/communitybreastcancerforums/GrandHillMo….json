I only use for monthly blood draws and Zometa, so don't really have to have one. I decided to go for no. 3 anyway, even though some nurses and my breast surgeon tried to talk me out of it. Before my insertion surgery, it took two nurses and several pokes to get the IV in. I told them that is why I need one! The new one is on the other side and works perfectly. No pain or anxiety for blood draws and infusions. I have never even had the numbing cream some people use. I just wish the PET scan contrast could be infused through it. My hospital says the glucose in the contrast would clog up the port. Good luck!",

I often think I would have preferred to have been initially diagnosed at stage iv rather than stage IIIb, so I could have avoided at least some of the treatments and also the intervening worries (really, knowledge ) that It would metatasticize anyway. I have never wanted to say this to anyone initially diagnosed as stage iv, so I am grateful for your comments.",
