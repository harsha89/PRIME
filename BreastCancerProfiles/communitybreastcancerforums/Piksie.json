      "Content": "Feb 8, 2019 09:59PM - edited Feb 9, 2019 05:45AM by Piksie I'm a little late to this discussion, but I started radiation on Jan 28. Today was 10 of 33. 25 whole breast, chest wall, axillary, and supraclavicular lymph nodes; 8 boosts. I'm just now starting to have mild SEs. An occasional stinging zinger in one small spot, tired (but nothing new), and just a tad bit of redness above my clavicle. My RO strongly recommended Mometazone twice per day, so that's all I've been doing so far. Although I'm mixing it with a lotion because it's thicker than Baby Butt Paste! I'm really hoping my energy level holds as I have two active boys, and I don't intend to take any time off work except for the daily trip for rads, but I do it early in the morning so only miss about 30 minutes most days. Work has been very supportive of my cancer journey, but my boss keeps comparing me to his 80 year old neighbor who \"did just fine\" with radiation. I don't have it in me to point out the obvious differences between her treatment and mine. Still, when fatigue hits, I plan on napping at work. :) After this first 33, we are going to hit T6 and my 9th rib. They've yet to be planned out, but it's coming. The proximity to my spinal cord makes me VERY nervous! But I guess it's gotta be done\u2026 Has anyone here had bone rads?",

My energy level has stayed up as well, but I'm sleeping way more than I did prior to diagnosis, so that's probably a factor as well. I hope you can get some relief! Pcranky, cute hair! I did my \"hair modelling\" yesterday. It was fun, but I really dislike the final product. The girl is an apprentice and her boss wasn't there, so she felt very uncomfortable going any shorter. I begged for a short pixie, but she just couldn't do it. Luckily, my boys are going to give me the whole shebang on Sunday. A few friends are coming over with light finger foods, but mostly to do the job if the boys aren't up for it. I'm on day 3, so it probably won't be going anywhere for a week and a half. Oh well! Given all the working parts (soccer, cub scouts, dad's schedule, sea cadets, etc), it's Sunday or never.  beeline, I wish I had more for you, but I'm one in and I feel pretty good. I took way too much food so will pack much lighter next time. They had pillows, heated blankets, etc for comfort. I'm not icing anything, so I don't have any recommendations there. bootsie, welcome. Looks like different diagnosis, same regimen. You are definitely not alone! This group of warriors has been an enormous blessing for me! Thank you all! Ginger, welcome!

It took me about a year after the first mastectomy in Jan '16 to consider dating again. (mostly online\u2026 ugh!!!) It was an awkward conversation that I never knew when to bring up. When the conversation did get that far, it was usually met with \"Wow, you're strong. I'm glad you told me. Doesn't change my position at all.\" I also heard \"My wife was taken by cancer and I just can't handle the emotional toll. Do they match? How big are your scars? Do you have nipples/feeling/sex drive?\" It was disheartening then, and I had hair! Someone asked me recently if I was dating now, and I almost spit coffee out my nose. WHAT???? NO!!!! I'm bald and sickly. I do have good days, and they're dedicated to my children and training. When chemo is done, I get some hair back, but God only knows what six weeks of radiation is going to do to me and my foob. Then back to annihilating my hormonal womanhood. I don't know if I'll ever get the urge to date again. But in the grand scheme of things, that's okay. I have my kids, a loving village, and Spartan. DD Taxol #1 for me today. Neuropathy fear has set in. I went back to the April chemo group to get some insight, and let me just say\u2026 ugh. Even though Taxol is \"easier\", I'd kind of rather continue with AC because I know what it does to me. I'm icing hands and feet, so taking a couple of backpacks for cold packs, an extra blanket, and a cooler full of ice. MO says it's fruitless. Ba humbug. Tigerlily, Wanderweg, JNKK, CONGRATULATIONS!!!! Here's to the next phase of kicking this stuff! BeingPositive, congrats on your certification. Beeline, new job!!! Yay! Sunocean, welcome. Hopeful that the adjustment will keep you safe and out of the hospital. Question to all: do you treat food prep differently after infusion? About annually, mom and I make approx. 20 dozen burritos a freeze them. I'll be on day 5. Should I take efforts to not touch the food? I would never even consider it until the story of the co-workers who didn't want to share a bathroom. Asking MO today, but curious to hear your opinions. Wanderweg, I also look just like me dad. I make a point to wear makeup and jewelry ever day. (Mom's advice)",

I iced, ate, gabbed, etc. My mom went with me for the first one to ensure I was able to drive home after all the extra meds, and I was fine. She slept in the chair next to me for at least two hours. We had a few good laughs about it. \u201cThere\u2019s my ride, in case I\u2019m sleepy.....\u201d Towards the end, found out that my chemo nurse is a Spartan.

There is one at Moores Cancer Center across campus, but I\u2019m not making the walk. I might take my own bell. December 19 - they should be plentiful... I finally asked about something for hot flashes and night sweats. Why didn\u2019t I ask sooner??? Gabapentin, which I\u2019ve taken at high dose for nerve damage after all of my surgeries and hated, works wonderful for hot flashes at a lower dose. With Gabapentin and Ativan, I\u2019ve slept better the last two nights than I have in two years. In fact, I slept so well last night that I must have turned off my alarm but have no recollection. We were all late for school/work. Whoops!!! My aunt is visiting. She had breast cancer and went through chemo about seven years ago. In conversing about it, she keeps saying that she hopes it\u2019s as easy on me as it was on her. She remembers that she was able to work through it, but has no recollection of the pathology of her cancer, the chemo regimen, side effects, etc. I can\u2019t decide if I feel sorry for her for her loss of memory or envy her for having no horrific memories of having cancer. I can\u2019t imagine wiping this from memory, but wouldn\u2019t that be nice? In seven years to have forgotten? In other news, my 13-year-old spent an hour and a half on the phone with a girl last night. First sign of a teenage crush. It was off-the-charts cute! I\u2019m grateful that life is moving along like it\u2019s supposed to for my boys, even though it freaks me out as a mom! Feeling super chatty, but I\u2019ll end it here. 😁 I hope you all can make the most of the day. Xoxo  ",

You just never know what it's going to do to you. I'm now on day 9 and feeling much better. A tad bit more lingering pain than last time, but I'm still doing really well. It's funny how easy it is to forget the bad parts when I'm feeling good. On Monday, I was contemplating throwing in the towel, but today I'm chipper and ready to tackle #3. I'm dreading it, but willing to do it. I'll have to remind myself of this statement on day 4. (which falls on Dec 8, but who's counting\u2026) :) Annette, I did bi-weekly AC and while days 4-6 weren't awesome, I was never completely down and out. I got the Neulasta shot, but Claritin was effective at minimizing the associated bone pain. My only warning there, take it longer than you think you have to. I stopped on day 6 the first time and got walloped with pain on day 8. Subsequent rounds, I made sure to take it longer and had no further bone pain. My good weeks were really good. Other than being bald, I had little to no side effects days 7-14. However, know that my experience is very unusual. Elizabeth, sorry for the setback. Is your treatment delayed or canceled? Brink, happy to hear your resting hr is coming down. Get out there and get it! :) Beeline, I hope Taxol lives up to its name and is easier than AC! Unrelated to cancer altogether, I took my kids to see \"The Grinch\" stage play at the Old Globe Theatre in SD last night.

Waahh! Tigerlily, that is so much hair!!! You look lovely! I think you can totally get away with that look. Yay! Oh, MandM, I'm so sorry you're having Taxol pain. It's horrible. Last night (day 5) I had a freight train parked on my feet, calves, and knees. Percocet every three hours with Advil and got very little relief. It's shocking. What in the hell is causing that kind of pain? I have the fear that it's causing permanent soft tissue/muscle/joint damage all over my body. How could it not? The days are manageable, but by 6pm, the random shooting pains get worse, and by the time I climb into bed, it's constant. I was hopeful that tonight would be better, but it's happening now. Ugh!!! My last Taxol is 12/19. I think, given that the pain is worst in bed, I'm going to ask for some meth so I can just avoid bed altogether. (kidding) I don't know what it is doing to my liver enzymes. My CBC is full of Highs and Lows, but they're not concerned about them, so I'm letting it ride. My resting heart rate is coming down; it had gone way up with AC. Fairchild, I'm in the same boat with sporting the bald look. It's obvious with the do rags and beanies that I have cancer, and it's much more comfortable, but something is keeping me from venturing out bald. Anyone I invite into my home has seen me bald, but they don't stare. And I still have the dead chicken stubble. No eyelashes, but can't get rid of the stubble\u2026 Hang in there, ladies.

In the 12 hours I was there, I learned that yes, my heart is damaged from chemo, but I was not in active cardiac distress. As I was hearing the discharge instructions at 1:30am Christmas morning, the Dr. told me that the Chest CT revealed \"a new spot on my spine related to cancer\". I asked about it briefly but really just wanted to get the f#@! out of there. So I sent MO a message asking him to look at the CT scan, and he came back with the impression that it is bone mets, but it responded perfectly to chemo. \"Sometimes a very small amount of cancer in the bone can be impossible to see (nothing was seen on your CT scan from July) but as the cancer cells die we can see your bone healing (the current sclerotic lesion.)\" Typically a biopsy is ordered but he is suggesting we skip it since it appears the chemo has killed the cancer cells and would be non-diagnostic. I will have a full body CT scan to see if there were any other sites missed in July that have \"healed\". Assuming only dead spots are found, I will continue with the current plan of radiation and anti-estrogen therapy with the knowledge of bone mets, so always on the lookout. My mom was in the ER with me but it happened so quickly, she didn't catch it. I may have several good years before it comes back so I don't want to share this outside of my extremely close circle, but I don't know how. How do I tell my mother that she will likely outlive me? Family members have asked how I'm doing since the ER visit, and while I want to yell \"It fucking sucked!\", I smile and say it was a false alarm. This is a very lonely disease.",

I've stayed away because of surgery recovery (8/17), part WBC concerns, but mostly because I'm bald (and a few other SEs). It's a small gym, similar to CrossFit so the same 15-20 people in the class I go to (4:15am), somewhat clickish, etc. Today was condition. Ugh!!! My HR was through the roof compared to six months ago, and I almost barfed a couple of times, but I did it. And I dragged a couple of friends with me who have fallen off the fitness path. It really feels good! I've joined a 90-day accountability group with the Spartan crew and need to establish my goals. The first half will be radiation; second half Ibrance, so I have no idea what is realistic, but I'm going to shoot for the moon. I need all the distractions I can get.  Mom took the bone mets news very well. We talked while doing a jigsaw puzzle. :) Turns out she heard the the ER doc's comment about the spot found on the CT, but didn't want to ask. So she wasn't completely surprised. I had just come from my meeting with MO so had tons of info and was able to answer all her questions. We got back to laughing and gabbing by the end. Meeting with RO today. Mapping, tattoos, and a start date. Woohoo!!! When does chemo brain end? My coffee mug and sugar bowl were next to each other on the counter. When adding milk, I poured it into the sugar.",

I had irritations, but minor compared to most. Prescription Mometazone likely helped, as does the fact that most of my breast skin has no sensation\u2026 My clavicle, shoulder, cleavage, and back itched, but never horrible. I'm hopeful that some suggestions here can help. I finished rads on Monday. I rang the bell last week after the 33 breast treatments, so the end of the five spine rads was anticlimactic. I didn't get to know any of the techs in the five visits, and only one tech was around when I came out of the dressing room. I just wanted to get the heck out of there! I hit the Apple Store on the way home and treated myself to a new Apple Watch. :) I've been following them for months because of the heart monitoring functions, so I decided to spoil myself. I started Ibrance last night and don't think it's having a bad effect. I also happened to pick up a sore throat at the same time, so my fatigue and headache would likely be here anyway. I sent a note to MO this morning because Ibrance comes with the same immunity issues. I learned that the key indicator for Ibrance is not WBC, but ANC which is a subset of WBC. While my WBC were low at my blood draw last week, ANC was within parameters, so I'm to continue with Ibrance and watch for fever (just like the good ol' days, right?) I've been gargling with salt water all night, hoping to kick it or at least get some sleep. Side note, it was a small issue on Tamoxifen, but now that I'm on Zoladex, I have TONS of facial hair! It's very fine and almost white, but it's definitely there and excessive. I think I'm going to have to wax my face! That's it for today, lovely ladies. I've taken Ativan and am ready to turn of the lights. Stay strong. P.S. I'm strongly considering keeping my hair super short. I kinda like it. :)",

The kids are planning to do the honors, but I'll have about eight girlfriends standing by to finish the job if they're not up for it. I will pick the one who's had the least champagne, because we're making it a celebration! MandM, I got my port under conscious sedation but don't remember a thing. The soreness was mild and easily manageable by Tylenol; however, I had a week and a half between port placement and first infusion. After my first infusion of AC on Wednesday, I'm very happy to have it. Sending positive thoughts for an uneventful first infusion for you. It's amazing how different everyone reacts to the same infusion, but hopefully yours will be like mine and mostly SE-free. Speaking of SEs, I don't think it is related to AC infusion, but has anyone experienced a low heart rate? I can't find anything indicating a connection, so perhaps Claritin or Lyrica are to blame. My resting HR is usually around 60, but I'm hanging out around 50-56 today. I REALLY don't want to talk to ANY doctors unless I HAVE to, so I'm watching closely with the intent to do nothing. :) Other than that, I'm just bloated. I keep eating small meals to avoid an empty stomach, but I don't feel hungry at all. I keep drinking coffee to get the pipes moving, but I know it counteracts all the water I've been drinking, so I drink more, so my belly gets bigger, then I eat so I don't have an empty stomach. Good thing I have the option to stay in stretchy pajamas most of the day! I'm on day 5, so I'm going to stop taking any preemptive meds and see how I do. Wanderweg, I can relate to your sentiment about losing your hair. I'm very anxious for this concoction to knock out cancer. Not that I want it to knock me on my rear, I do want to see signs of cell destruction... I signed up for Chemo Angels last night. Looking forward to that little gift of kindness. Perhaps some day soon, I'll pay it forward. I hope you're all doing well!",

Red-eyed, completely glazed over, almost psychedelic. My whole body was tingling/numb. It was scary. I'm either going back to a small dose of Gabapentin to take the edge off, or I'll just have to suck it up. I'm seeing OT today to address lymphedema and cording, and now nerve pain will be added to the talking points. Tiger, cute! That one made me smile. Thanks! I hope it works for you!

Some of my staples: stuffing, rice, beans, onions, green chili, jalepeno, enchilada sauce, cream of _____, cheese. Sometimes I stuff them with veggies, just to make sure kids don't eat them all. The most important thing is to have a quality tortilla (wraps tight without breaking or tearing) and someone who can master saran wrap to make it air-tight. Then I have a quick snack/meal for months, depending on how many veggies I put in them. Wanderweg, I missed your Tamoxifen remark. I took it Jan '16 to Jul '18 and had little to no SEs. I hope you find the same, and I hope it is more effective! JNKK, hope you're still rash-free today! BoE, glad they found your crazy neighbor! If it were me, I would wait until after AC to move as it is so unpredictable. But house shopping is fun for me. I'd be all over that now! J So Taxol infusion went really well, Taxol SEs have not. All I've heard is that it's \"easier\", so I was completely surprised by the bone pain that started Friday (day 3) and is luckily letting up today. I read that Percocet was not effective for Taxol bone pain, but it allowed me to sleep. I've started taking L-Glutamine as a possible preventative measure and will cross my fingers. Three more to go\u2026. I've been reading forward to have some realistic expectations and it's kind of kicked me in the gut. (bone pain, neuropathy, hair regrowth, radiation and all its lovely gifts, long-term SEs, etc) The timeline just keeps getting longer. I guess hobbling around all weekend has left me susceptible to feeling sorry for myself. I need to snap out of it and invest in some quality fake lashes. Love and peace to you all! xoxo ",

I'm not going to quit, but I'm going to be much more proactive about pain management. He did not hesitate to prescribe Percocet since I'm willing to continue. As with AC, after the initial onset of symptoms resolved, I had several very good days. I was able to do another Spartan on Sunday, but I'm done now until after radiation, hopefully by the end of Feb. MandM, about Gabapentin, I have used it effectively for nerve damage after surgery but sped up the weening process due to side effects. At 900 mgs, headaches, crossed eyes, confusion, etc. Now I use 300 mgs for hot flashes and night sweats, and it works like a charm! I don't know what it would do for neuropathy. I haven't had any symptoms yet, but perhaps it's due to Gabapentin? I'm also down to about 20% of my eyelashes, darn it! One of my tasks this weekend is to figure out how to wear false lashes.

Because I had implants going into surgery, I was a candidate for immediate reconstruction, so it was out with the old, good bye breast tissue, in with the new. While the areola remained mainly unchanged, there was significant blood loss to the nipple, causing the top half to turn black and fall off. So from a distance, I have two nipples, on close examination, lefty is quite different. Truthfully, I wouldn't mind much if they both were replaced with tattoos. After nursing two babies and all the surgeries, these things just won't sit down\u2026 There are worse problems, I know. :) As for what I call them: lefty and righty. They are so different that a collective term hasn't struck me. Lefty tried to kill me twice. Righty hung around to be the model for rebuilding lefty twice. Tigerlily, I hope the bumps on your tongue resolve without issue! I'm curious to hear about your radiation journey. Have you experienced any topical burns? Sunocean, Lovely photo! JNKK, I hope your dad's visit goes well. Perhaps a chance for everyone to brush up on their Chinese. :) And enjoy Taos! MandM, Beeline, PNWCyclist, how are you doing with Taxol? (And anyone else I missed!) Hair: still the plucked chicken look that I assume will be how I go into regrowth as I had my last DD Taxol yesterday. I lost my eyelashes about three weeks ago, but my eyebrows have held at about 50%, so filling in with a brow pencil is an option if I want to go through the trouble. My 10 year old comments every time. If he thinks they're too dark, he's sure to let me know. I never did try fake lashes. I can't get used to the idea of putting glue so close to my eyeball, so I rely on really heavy eyeliner and try not to look like King Tut too often. I carry a makeup bag with me for the first time in my life, only because my eyes water so much that it takes off the outside third of my eyeliner. 2/3 of an eye is not a good look. Looking forward to regrowth, but I've read that they might grow and fall out several times before they're permanent. What torture! Chemo: DONE! 1 day PFC. I should be jumping for joy, but I'm going to wait until I get through the pain this weekend. I anticipate being okay by Christmas morning. Thank God for small favors. MO said at the rate I was taking Percocet, I was maxing my Acetaminophen intake, so we dropped the 5/325 P and moved to 10 mg Oxycodone. Told me to take as much as I need to get through it. No risk of overdose, just the warning that I will be extra constipated. I love that guy. He seems to be intrigued by me. He's seen approx. 2% of his DD Taxol patients with Acute Pain Syndrome and none of them have carried through with treatment. Very minimal neuropathy that begins to resolve itself at the end of my two-week cycles, so hopefully I'll have no lasting effect; just a period of time where the weaker regrowth has to take its course. So all in all, chemo wasn't bad. I will fall off the planet this weekend and come back a happy camper. I'm doing this willingly, so no use complaining. So now onto the next steps. Port removal in 3-4 weeks; Back to 28-day Zolodex shots and daily Arimidex; squeeze in a baseline bone density test somewhere; radiation will start mid-January; follow-up on lung spot and bone spot after radiation; possible oophorectomy when the dust settles. It's definitely a lifestyle\u2026 All of my workouts since August 17 have been outdoors to avoid excessive germs. I'm now looking at being able to return to the gym as I'm able, but I'm sort of dreading it. Many people don't know why I disappeared, and it's such a clickly place that I'm sure there will be secret stares and gossip. I'm pretty sure the awkwardness will pass with time, especially when I have enough hair to lose the head covers. I just have to bite the bullet because I really miss it. Christmas readiness? Heck no!!! We have two kittens we didn't have last year. I'm scared to death of what they might do to a fully decorated tree, so it only has lights. It's probably going to stay that way\u2026 Christmas morning pictures won't be all full of visual Christmas cheer, but neither will I. :) There's always next year. I'm still contemplating Christmas cards (more like New Year's cards), but can't decide if I want to be in it. I could use a collection from the year, but because of Facebook, my loved ones have seen all the best pics. It might be something else I skip this year. Well, enough chatting. Sorry if I missed any major points, but I should get back to work. :) Always love hearing from all of you! Happy Holidays!",

As long as you're taking it, it is just as effective as the higher dose. The science of it doesn't make sense to me, but I won't be upset if I end up at 75 mgs. Fewer SEs sounds wonderful to me!

Optimistic for NED, but if not, I don't want to know until I get back. Zolodex and Zometa for me today so I took the whole day off. Lounging with my cats for the morning, taking some ME time.

I've taken Claritin and Tylenol; hope it kicks in soon! I had a very good meeting with OT yesterday. I got my lymphedema education, order for a sleeve, etc., and went over stretches and massage to get rid of the cords. But more educational was the new take on nerve pain. After Gabapentin and Lyrica, I am going to suck it up and deal with it; wait it out. By allowing the painful areas to be engaged, accelerated nerve growth and healing take place. I spent yesterday and today with the back of my arm exposed, and although it is very uncomfortable, I can already feel an improvement. I feel kind of like I won the lottery in a weird, almost sadistic way. Advanced apologies for the poo talk, but I've been putting out miniature snickers and river rocks since Wednesday and feel like I'm going to pop. I look like I could easily be well into my second trimester. I'm now on day two of Miralax and waiting impatiently for Amazon to deliver Senna (same day \u2013 gotta love it!) I plan to work tomorrow, but I'm wondering if I'm going to be able to leave the house if the Senna does its job. And I hope the Claritin kicks in BEFORE the Senna does! Tons of lessons learned for round #2! Hope you're all having a lovely evening!",

Finding a PC, getting all the necessary referrals, approvals, etc. in the middle of chemo (or radiation if it doesn't happen before Jan).

I'll be better. :) I've also been a fly on the wall in a few mets threads, but I'm not ready for that. And there's the radiation group that I'm late to, but it's hard to jump into an ongoing conversation. Oh\u2026 the introvert in me\u2026 I had my second monthly Zometa infusion and shot of Zoladex yesterday, and seem to have lucked out again with few SEs. Tiger, so sorry you had such a horrible time with it, especially being away from home! From what I've read, the first one is the worst, but I can imagine you'd be leery of going through that horrible mess again. I got a normal saline bolus before, and Zometa was infused over 15 mins. If yours was the same, perhaps they offer a slower infusion next time and pre-medicate with Claritin, Advil, Aleve, etc. Today is 13 of 33 rads; just starting to feel the slightest bit irritated. Work has gone bonkers and will stay that way through February so I'm hoping my energy stays up. I think I'm going to take some time off in March, though. Last day of this series of rads is 3/14, then we go straight into zapping T6 and possibly my 9th rib. I've got an MRI on 2/28 to figure all that out. On the eating topic, OMG! I've completely given up. I had to laugh at myself recently, on the day when all I consumed was cheese, Girl Scout cookies, and chardonnay. It was funny and horrible; I had absolutely no self-control. Even my kids noticed, but mostly because they think they have dibs on the cookies. Ummm\u2026 I don't think so! My will power bucket is close to empty right now. Being, chemo pills AFTER infusions??? I'll start Ibrance after radiation, and the SEs are said to be minimal for most. Do you know what they're suggesting for you? And why? I really hope it's a false alarm and you can get to the other side! Beeline, crazy that you fell through the cracks when their business is saving lives! Interesting that our next steps are all so different.

Blood work, met with MO, then off to the infusion room. I have to say, I love the port. This time, I got a local anesthetic before the stick, but picked up a prescription for the topical cream going forward. The nurse explained everything as it was happening. I received a couple of additional meds before A and C, but other than the anti-nausea, I don't remember the details. (whoops) The Red Devil definitely is red. My first to potty trips were reddish orange, but that's gone now. I had a foggy brain and headache last night, but I think that was the Lyrica I'm taking for nerve pain. I have to figure that one out, because I can't live and work like that. I had the same pain 2.5 years ago and used Gabapentin, but suffered through the side effects. This time we're trying an alternative with fingers crossed, but doesn't look promising. Or maybe it was a combo and I need to be more optimistic... :) I got a 20 minute leg massage toward the end. They're in the process of bringing on an acupuncturist so hopefully next time, that will be on the menu. A friend gave me CBD cookies as an option for the nerve pain, so I tried it Mon and Tues. Not sure if there is an effect but I hadn't heard of the THC effect on ER+ cancer, so I'll have to research. But I have to say, I went about 24 hours without night sweats or hot flashes after Monday's night time dose of CBD. That was awesome!!! Although I don't know if there is a direct connection. My white blood cells and red blood cells were at the very bottom of normal going into this, so that kinda sucks. I really hope Neulesta does it's job. I have kids and cats, and neither are clean creatures. Although, I have tons of friends lined up to keep the cat stuff clean. The boys are on task too, but of course, they suck at it. I got some conflicting info re pain management. MO says Ibuprofen, chemo nurse says Tylenol. Anyone have a strong preference for one or the other? I'm really happy to have finally begun this process. There is still cancer in my Level III lymph nodes (based on 18/18 in Level I and Level II). I don't know if a Level III dissection will be possible, but I'll certainly ask after chemo and radiation is complete. All the scans prior to surgery didn't detect the ugliness, so I'm not going to rely on them after treatment. Ugh!!! Next step is hair modeling today, then shaved by the boys in about a week and a half. Let's get this party started! Stay strong, ladies! xoxo",

Oh, the joys of being a woman\u2026 At 38, I went on a high dose of Progestin to treat heavy menstruation and stopped menstruating until I was diagnosed with BC at 42. At that time, I stopped Progestin and moved to Tamoxifen. I became pretty regular on Tamoxifen with more typical symptoms of perimenopause. FFW to July at age 45, BC recurrence and moved to Arimidex and Zoladex but have discontinued both during chemo. Those wasted no time putting me into full menopause; the hot flashes are no joke! I'm not sure why I'm not taking them during chemo but pretty sure I'll resume after. I have no idea what my body would have done naturally, because I've been chemically controlled since 38. :/ Either chemo or the Arimidex/Zoladex concoction will ensure menopause continues; although, I may opt for an oophorectomy after chemo to forego the monthly shot in the belly. On the nerve pain front, I am pleasantly surprised at the progress I've made. I have not taken anything, nor have I guarded the painful areas. It's bothersome, but improving quickly. If/when I get back to running, I will likely wear a sleeve to start, but will make it a goal to eliminate it completely. Today is head shaving day. I could probably wait a week as I have a lot of hair, but I'm anxious to put checks in boxes. And since I've opened the conversation with my boys, my little one talks about shaving my head every day. All in all, feeling good today. I'm quasi working from home, but having trouble staying motivated. I'd much rather clean and nest, but not doing much of that, either.

I guess my point, if the committee says chemo, take it seriously, but perhaps a second opinion for peace of mind. Elizabeth, super cute!!! I also love this collection of new best friends. My best friend here had a BMX about six years ago because of DCIS and dense breasts. (no further treatment) We now call each other \"breasties\". Some people don't get it, and that's okay... Day 3 of AC 2 today. Feeling good with an occasional twinge of bone pain; seems like my entire rib cage this time. Last time, it was day 8, only hips/pelvis/lower back. I wish we could count on all infusions being the same, but alas, I don't think so. My hair is officially falling out. A pinch to my shaved head yields 15-30 hairs. My boys started to draw bald lines in my head last night, so I turned in early. Hope you all have a \"great as it can be\" weekend!",

I had the weird full body bruised feeling days 3 and 4, but it seems to have subsided. Now I'm just drained with a cold that is threatening to become a sinus infection. Counting on Neulasta to kick up the WBCs! My boys aren't necessarily helpful, but they do let me sneak away for naps when I need to. As for other SEs, my face is very dry, but adamia therapeutic repair lotion seems to help. The base of my nailbeds are darkening, but I think I'm just going to have to wait that one out. The plucked chicken near death look remains on my head. Constipation has been manageable with Senokot and coffee. Night sweats and hot flashes are unrelenting. I feel very fortunate to only have the SEs that I do. I know that some of you are having a very hard time, and it seems like luck is the biggest factor. I did run the spartan race. It was amazing to be out there in the dirt, scaling obstacles like nothing is wrong with me. I didn't want it to end. I went as incognito as possible with the dark do rag under my number and headband so it kind of looked like hair. My team had shirts made that I was initially reluctant to wear, but it was a very sweet gesture and meant a lot to them. And the part referencing me was small enough that only a few people commented. And those were \u201cmy mom/sister/aunt etc.....\" I love being out there so much that I'm doing another one in November. I signed up for these in May when I was on top of the world. I'll be on day 12 of Taxol #1 and not exactly at the top, but that's okay. Happy Sunday to all of you. I hope you're making the best of it.",

I'm starting Dose Dense Taxol 11/7 (b-weekly; four treatments) and it's really got me worried. MO is of the firm belief that icing is ineffective based on the biology of the process (specifically, that the damage happens at the spine, not the fingers/toes), but I might do it anyway. Just trying to figure out the logistics as the infusion center doesn't provide it. Maybe a bucket of ice for my hands? All the reviews on gloves discount their ability to stay cold long enough. My chemo weirdness: I love Halloween! This year, I pawned my kids off on other people, dimmed the lights, and ignored the doorbell. I had so many fun ideas on incorporating my bald head into a killer costume, but when the time came, I just didn't have it in me. I'm sick of being bald. Oh \u2013 and I had to get my government ID renewed on Monday which requires a new picture\u2026. The guy taking the pics asked if I could take my hat off. I said, \"Um\u2026 I can, but I'm bald.\" He had the deer-in-the-headlights expression, but let me keep my head covered. As soon as I have the slightest shadow of hair, I'm getting a new ID. Healthy vibes to all of you! xoxo",

It's just one more trip to most people, but it's ONE MORE TRIP! Ugh! Wanderweg, KK2018, I haven't made an effort to find eyelashes yet. I really need to, though. I'm starting to look sickly, and I can see it in the eyes of people I come across. It only adds to the \"poor me\" factor, which I've been handling pretty well until recently. All I've shown to the outside world is the crazy Spartan girl who won't be stopped. That girl gets out less and less. I can't hide behind it anymore. I think I'm going to a MAC counter or Sephora to talk with someone who knows eyelashes, because I sure don't! As for sushi, I have stayed away during the first week after transfusion to be safe, but my WBC count has been high, so I have eaten as I've wanted to for the second week. Sushi has become my go-to meal the night before infusion. Taxol is kicking my booty right now. The first night after Dose #2, my face itched so much that I rubbed off half my remaining brows. It was finally resolved by rubbing Benadryl all over my face and had no other symptoms of reaction. Days 3-6 are very painful. They call it joint and muscle pain, but it seems to be everywhere. Saturday night, I lay in bed wondering when my left ovary would explode. I've had chest pains that made me worry about a heart attack, but then I had the same pain on the opposite side, so stopped worrying about dying immediately. I get stabbing pains in just about every organ I have. The underside of my ribs, my uterus, knees, hips, back. You name it. The only part of me unaffected so far is my arms. Who knew\u2026 I stayed away from Percocet on Saturday to spend time with my brother and sis-in-law who were visiting, but the pain got away from me. It took about half a day for Percocet to kick in. That was NO good! So now I'm looking at either continuing the current course and suck up the pain (preferred as I don't want to give up), or modifying (reducing the dose for my remaining two double doses, moving to weekly, or quitting). My biggest concern after much research is long-term SEs. I can't live like this! Luckily, I don't have any signs of neuropathy yet, but if one is to believe the internet (\u2026) the two go hand in hand. Anyway, Oh My God, Sheri! Get off the pity train! I had a lovely Thanksgiving with family and friends, and it was nice to get a visit from bro and sis-in-law. My kids are happy and well-adjusted. I think the goal of productive citizen will be reached, at least with the oldest. Jury's still out on the little one. I'm skipping most holiday gatherings as they fall on my bad weekend, but I know they love me anyway. They're all waiting patiently for me to get back to myself, and I feel so fortunate for them all. And for you all, the only ones who have any idea what I'm talking about\u2026ever To all of you who are planning vacations, enjoy! If you make it to San Diego, look me up. To those who have finished chemo, Yaay!!! Moving on to rads, I'll see you there in January. Save me a seat. Xoxo Sheri",

My bone scan is Jan 3, and the whole case will be presented to the UCSD tumor board on Jan 7. Assuming no live cancer is found, MO expects concurrence of Stage 4, NED and will continue the current regimen of radiation and anti-estrogen therapy. I asked if I should continue with port removal, and he said yes. Assuming it is MBC and I'm NED, I won't need infusion for years. The life expectancy found online is dreary and outdated. My mentality now is at least 10 years. I plan to outlive my mother who's 70, and I will see my little one through high school, perhaps even college. I shared with a close confidant and with my ex-husband so far. He's non-emotional, and we have the task of raising our boys, so the choice to share with him wasn't a hard one. I also knew he would not be inclined to feel sorry for me, and of course, he doesn't. :) Everyone else will be emotional and shower me with pity, and I just don't need it. I will freak out when I'm no longer NED. Until then, denial is my middle name. Although, it has inspired me to purge. Get rid of things that are taking up space, crowding my closet, etc. If it doesn't bring me joy, it's gone. That should keep me busy for a while. I had a 2D echocardiogram yesterday as a cardiac follow-up. Not sure when I'll get the results, but I hope it's soon. Knowing there is some damage has made me leery of exercise, and that is not okay\u2026 weight bearing exercise will be a large part of keeping my bones healthy. As soon as I get the green light, I'm going to resume my previous lifestyle. Boot camps, mountain climbing, Spartan races, etc. In fact, I'm going to kick it up a notch. When you stop living, you start dying. Enough cliche. I'm off to take my boys indoor rock climbing. A bit of neuropathy will keep me from climbing this time, but I'm confident that it is temporary. -Sheri",

I think I'd be up for that at the moment.... someone just take me away from all this nonsense! So my scan wasn't awesome. It identified \"increased uptake in T6 vertebral body\" which is the one identified in the chest Xray. Also \"focal uptake in left posterior ninth rib\", \"focal activity is noted in the spinous process of C3 vertebral body\", and \"minimal activity seen left posterior seventh rib\". I spoke to Onc nurse yesterday and I have an appointment in two hours to get more details. Looks like we're adding Ibrance to my treatment plan, and possibly additional radiation on any live spots. If a biopsy is done, it will be a rib. TBD. Ibrance is oral chemotherapy that is taken daily for three weeks, then one week off. I believe I'll take it until side effects are significant or it becomes ineffective. (the nurse's mother has been taking it for three years.) I think bi-weekly blood draws and quarterly scans are my new norm. Tigerlily, I LOVE your hair! I have had that haircut in the past and loved it, so at the moment, my goal is pixie and that's where it will stay. Ibrance comes with hair thinning, so long locks are probably off the table.

I will continue with radiation; consult and sim planning on Thursday. I'm back on Zoladex and Arimidex as of 1/16, and will add Ibrance and Zometa (for bone strength) after radiation. I got more info on the echo I did after the ER visit. Ejection Fraction on baseline echo in Sept was 73. Last week's echo was 74. Normal is 55-75, so all good. My elevated Troponin level of 29 is unexplained, so I have a referral to a cardio-oncologist. He seemed excited about that. \"I know someone who's going to LOVE you!\" I got the green light to do as much physical activity as I can stand. That will vary through radiation, and I don't know yet how I'll react to Ibrance/Zometa. But I was really afraid he'd tell me to take it easy, and the only thing I have to give up at the moment is grapefruit!

Now at UCSD, they offer for those proven to cause mouth sores, like Adriamycin. MO agreed to skip the steroids. Yay! I still got the pre-med infusion steroid, but that's it. He said it is currently protocol to prescribe it and remove it if it causes problems but said they are considering NOT prescribing and adding it as needed. I'm hopeful that the others will do the trick! He gave me the green light to go back to the gym. I was kind of surprised because of the germ factor, but the guidance was to try to go when there are fewer people and to wipe down equipment. I was doing daily boot camp before this; I think I'm going to start at the YMCA this time. (So says me on day 2 when I feel fine....) He's writing me a prescription for a \"cranial prosthesis\" (wig). I'm not sold on it, but I might get one similar to my old hairstyle for special occasions. I guess it depends on how much insurance covers. $$ Warm fuzzies to all of you! xoxo",

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2018 07:41AM - edited Oct 8, 2018 07:46AM by Piksie Good morning, ladies. Checking in on day 13 of AC #2. I've been feeling really good. The only side effect I've had this week is a bald head. I hiked my favorite mountain Saturday and did some Obstacle Course Race training yesterday. (Climbing ropes, jumping walls, swinging on rings, carrying heavy buckets, etc.) It was sooo good for my psyche! After completing my first Spartan race in May, I signed up for two more this year. Both much longer races than the first. I had resigned to miss them, but I am now planning to do the short version Oct 21. I'll be on day 11. I may walk most of it, but I'll get from A to B eventually. The prospect of it has given me new energy and hope. Fuck cancer! On the travel topic: We missed my brother's wedding in Cancun in March '16 because of my mastectomy in January. My kids were really bummed! I promised them that when I was able, we would go anywhere in the world, and we would continue annually. We spent a year spinning the globe and researching destinations. We ultimately decided on a cruise to the Mexican Riviera for '17 and had a blast. So much so that our '18 trip was to a place we visited on an excursion from the cruise, Yelapa, Mex, a tiny fishing village near Puerto Vallarta with no roads that is only accessible by water. (so peaceful!) Being in this position again has only strengthened my resolve to show them the world while I can. Not to be morbid, but my chance of recurrence after a first recurrence is over 30%. I know my days are numbered. I don't plan on missing '19 so we are in the process of planning, and we won't miss a year until I am physically unable. It's my silver lining to cancer. We did very little traveling prior to cancer, but it is a priority now. Anyway, sorry for rambling. I'm truly sorry for those of you who are struggling with SEs. I count my blessings every day that I've been able to function mostly normal after day 3/4. I'm hopeful that I've figured out what got me the first time, but I know each one is different so still bracing myself for infusion #3 on Thursday. PNWCyclist, welcome. Praying that you see results! Peace and love to all of you.",

The upper half of my body is sore to touch, like a giant bruise. Does that happen to any of you? I mostly recovered after that, just a lingering low-level nausea that has persisted this time. Nothing to keep me at home, just enough to be aware of. I think it's better when I keep food in my stomach, so I've been doing so. Some of my pants are a wee bit snug\u2026 Oh well\u2026 Other than during the infusion, I skipped the steroids and associated SEs, and Claritin did its job on the bone pain. I felt a little anemic days 4-9 so ate all the red meat and spinach I could get my hands on, and I feel like it helped. This last bit of coarse stubble on my head isn't budging, but fortunately, my brows and some lashes are still intact, too. In general, I've just been schlepping along, giving most things a half-assed effort. I've kind of been living like \"F&*k Cancer. I'm not changing my lifestyle just because of you!\" And then I have a moment of clarity. \"Umm\u2026 get over yourself, Sheri. No more ice cream for dinner; drink more water and less vodka; no sushi for a reason, stupid!\" etc\u2026 Kind of weird because my lifestyle has never included ice cream for dinner, but now I just don't seem to give a damn sometimes. So tomorrow I run the Spartan race after a week of ice cream and vodka, and low-grade nausea that is probably because of the ice cream and vodka. I think chemo brain is kicking in because I failed to request renewal of my epilepsy med, so I will be without this weekend. I'm sure I'll be fine, but just another reason to snap out of it and get my sh*t together. Rules DO apply to me, and I am NOT invincible. Ugh! Anywhooo, enough griping. I am packing up to make the three hour drive to the Spartan race and looking forward to both; I'm way better off than I thought I would be two months ago; Everyone else in my life is happy and healthy; and I know I'm loved. I just need to find that place in me that wants to give 100%. Or even >80%. :) Hope you're all thriving! xoxo",

Winterish here (sort of\u2026 high of 61 today), so beanies are no problem. It's actually been helpful at work. I work in a government building that has no heat right now. Old converted concrete barracks that holds the cold so my office is about 58 degrees. I'll skip my smarta** remarks about government efficiencies. Sue, I'd love to see the new eyebrows if you're up for sharing! Beeline, I'm so so sorry you're experiencing Taxol pain. Breaks my heart! I hope they've been generous with the pain meds. Oxycodone 10mg allowed me to sleep after my last infusion. How many do you have left? Fairchild, I feel the same about going topless. There was a woman at a Christmas church event with no hair, and she was all smiles and seemed to be full of joy with her husband. I was envious in my beanie that resembled a Russian Snow Queen. I prefer no top, but I do it to avoid making other people uncomfortable (including my boys when in public). And sorry HR is being difficult. Most people have no idea what it's like. My immediate supervisor will ask me how I'm doing and then dash for the door if I answer truthfully. Brink, happy to hear that you are healing from your UMX. My lashes didn't fall out until Taxol, and I still have about 50% of my brows. Hoping that's the end of the loss, but who knows. To all of you who have commented on my mets revelation, thank you. I've yet to break down, but I also haven't told my mother. I think they will coincide. I had a bone scan yesterday and hope to hear something Monday; same day as the tumor board. I'm assuming (with every hopeful bone in my body) that any other spots have been killed by chemo. I have my initial consult with RO on the 10th. And my PCP said the latest echo was normal, so back to training. Let's get this party started! Of course, every little back pain scares the beJesus out of me, but I think I'll get used to that. NED = now enjoy denial. Although, I will have to get more serious about lifestyle. For a few days, I craved a drink and I didn't tell myself no. Going forward, alcohol and sugar, two of my favorite things, will be cut significantly. Ugh. Off to bed. My little one is graduating from boot camp tomorrow. One week away with the Naval Sea Cadet Corps. Can't wait!!!",

I've been single for eight years and have dabbled in online dating a few times over the years. I recently created a profile on one and was very honest about my current position, stating that I'm window shopping while going through chemo. Surprisingly, there has been a significant response. I think it's weird\u2026. So I checked it Friday and had a very nice message from a man who gave enough information that I could look him up online, and he's legit. We've hit it off well enough online that I'm going on a blind date today! Bald! (He's also bald; it's been the subject of many jokes.) This feels really weird! As for the boys, my little one graduated from Navy League Cadet Corps boot camp yesterday. Comparable to to the Scouts, but run by the Navy in a military fashion. He's so excited about it! As for smells, we've made a rule that no one takes shoes off in the car. If they do, my car smells like feet for days.  Wanderweg, beautiful! How nice to have a hairline. Sue, love the eyebrows! Beeline, can't wait to see yours. I'm afraid to do anything permanent. What if I don't like the shape? (I'm sure yours will be lovely!) Chemo brain incident: A colleague named Greg had just been in my office when I wrote back to Bill the first time, and I called him Greg. What a trooper to let me off the hook!!! Have a great day!",

Keep looking forward, and live life with purpose. The asthmatic teens who smoke sounds like a fascinating project! Being where I am now, it shocks me every time I see someone smoke a cigarette. I would love to approach them with \"WTF! Idiot!\". I would never, but I think it every time. Brink is correct, after a BMX with good margins and clean nodes, radiation is not recommended. As for an invisible disease that is trying to kill us, that strikes me to the core. I'm back to strength training at the gym as of Friday. Everyone is commenting that I look healthy and strong. I say thank you, but I know inside that this disease is lurking and will strike again. It feels very real to me, but I've had 3-½ years since the first diagnosis and three months to get my head around mets, which wasn't really a surprise. I'm a realist, and approaching it this way helps me keep going. (ISTP, very strong T) :) Anyway\u2026. Sorry for that, but thanks for being my sounding board. Off I go to 1 of 5 spine and rib zaps.
