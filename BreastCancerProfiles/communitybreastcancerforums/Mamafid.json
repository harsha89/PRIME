    "Content": "Mamafid wrote: I just had my surgical biopsy last Friday and I wanted to share my own experience here.  I am thrilled beyond measure to report that my results just came in today as benign (PASH) -- but I will never forget the anxiety and fear leading up to the procedure and waiting for the results.  I looked to this board again and again for information during a time when I was so very fearful. Primarily, of the pain during the guided wire placement prior to the actual biopsy.  Hoping that sharing my own guided wire experience will also help others... The bottom line is that I felt little or no pain during the guided wire placement.  I firmly believe that this was due to the fact that at our first meeting I was able to directly communicate my fears and anxiety to my surgeon (a woman, by the way) who took me seriously and wanted to help.  I requested a topical numbing cream to apply to my breast and she wrote a prescription. I applied the cream to my breast and covered it with plastic wrap before the guided wire procedure.  I did not even feel the pinch or sting of the Lidocaine injection in radiology.  I was completely numb during the mammogram and placement of the wire.  My doctor also wrote a prescription for Ativan which helped calm my nerves before the procedure.  My all-female team (radiologists, nurses, anesthesiologist, surgeon) could not have been kinder or more compassionate. It was still a very, very scary day, which I hope to never repeat.  But, I am so grateful that I had care givers who listened to me and gave me the pain meds that I needed to make it through.  It is my hope that any woman who has to go through this procedure will be treated similarly.  Wishing everyone well. SUMMARY: Hospital: Mass General Hospital, Boston MA (Avon Breast Center) Surgeon: Dr. Specht  Meds taken before guided wire placement:  1) topical Lidocaine cream applied to entire breast upon arrival at hospital, and 2) Ativan (2 tabs -- one before leaving home in the morning and another 30 minutes before radiology) Meds during guided wire placement - injection of Lidocaine Meds during surgical biopsy - twilight sedation Log in to post a reply",
