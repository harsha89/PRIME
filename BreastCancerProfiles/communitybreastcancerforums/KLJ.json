The Florida doctors only told me that I had cancer and to find a team of doctors in CA since I was leaving so soon. Had I not been relocating she said she would have sent me to a surgeon, oncologist, and reconstructive surgeon. I guess that's why I really felt left in the dark as far as what is next. I know I will find out in two weeks but this has been going on for almost a month now and I am about at my wits end. I just want to get on with the treatment whatever that might be. I am living in a small town so getting the recommendation for my surgeon was pretty easy. She came highly recommended so I feel good about that. Just wish I wasn't waiting so long. I hand carried all of my paperwork and CD's to her office to make sure they were received quickly (not trusting the mail) and I am assuming she has looked at the images. I was told that if she felt I needed to be seen sooner that they would call and I haven't heard from them. I am taking that as a good sign :)",

On Dec. 18th my husbands company relocated us to California so I left Florida with nothing but a CD of images, a pathology Addendum Report, and a report describing the Protocols, Procedure, Post Biopsy, Clip Placement, Pathology Results and Recommendations. Due to relocating I had to find a Breast Surgeon here and don't have an appt. for another 2 weeks. They have my reports, cd, and have obtained my slides to be looked at by their pathologist. But I HATE the waiting. According to the Doctor that did my biopsy the good news was that my tumor was only 4mm but very near the chest wall. I saw the placement of the clip on my post mammo and the technologist had a very hard time even getting the clip to show in the mammo. There is nothing in any of these reports that gives me a Grade or if Lymph Nodes are involved which makes me think I will need more tests and /or surgery. It does tell me that I am ER+ 100%, PR+ 88%, and HER2 Negative. Does anyone have any idea what I may be looking at in the future I know I have to wait for the final word from the surgeon but trying to do some research and calm my nerves! If that is even possible! Thank you! You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control your attitude toward what happens to you, and in that, you will be mastering change rather than allowing it to master you.

The doctor did say that the good news was the size and the bad news was that it was 2 types. What I didn't add to my story was that this all started because of an abnormality seen in the right breast which I was told to wait 6 months and have another mammo done. I opted not to wait and asked for an MRI. I had to 2 cyst aspirations on the rt. which came back benign and an MRI guided biopsy done on both breasts. The rt side is all benign and the left side has the cancer which would not have been found had I not asked for the MRI. Thank goodness I have good friends who pushed me to ask for the MRI! Thanks again!",

Made me jump up and grab my pathology report because at my second appointment with my surgeon she mentioned that when she presented my case at he weekly meeting with several surgeons, oncologists, and radiologists it was mentioned that my Ki67 was high. She didn't seem to feel that it was and that I wouldn't need chemo. At that point I didn't even know what a Ki67 was. Now that I have looked at everything here is what my pathology report says. ER=100%, PR=88%, HER2Neu 1.4, Ki67=47%. Then it gives reference ranges. Ki67 greater than 20% = unfavorable. I am not scheduled for surgery until Mar. 17th so won't get an Oncotype score until then if that test is done. This still makes me feel that her comment about my cancer being a Grade I and non-aggressive can't be 100% true. Am I over analyzing? It's true too that if they give you too much time between diagnosis and treatment you have more time to research! I was diagnosed on Dec. 12th and had to move from FL to CA on Dec. 18th due to husbands work. My treatment is being even more delayed due to hospital scheduling and the timing schedule of my surgeon and my plastic surgeon.",

I really don't know and my surgeon like Farmer Lucy said, basically waived it off and didn't seem to think much of it. My husband is banning me from looking stuff of on the internet for the day! I can't help it, it's my personality type to delve into every nook and cranny of whatever it is I need to research. But, since he is outside building me a chicken coop :) I am going to give it a rest for now! I'll be back researching more tonight!",

I think the closer I get to my appt. on Weds. with the surgeon the worse it will get. Seems like this has been going on forever. Diagnosed on Dec. 12th. Movers came to our house in FL and packed us up and we headed out to CO for Christmas with my oldest daughter. She was diagnosed 2 years ago with Triple Negative BC at the age of 31. 2 rounds of chemo and a dbl mast. I thought we were done with BC and then wham, here I am with it. Because of our move it has delayed me getting anything more done besides what was done in FL. I have had 2 MRI guided biopsy's done and 2 aspirations. So all I know is that I have DCIS and IDC. How much more has to happen before I can get a stage and a grade? I suppose I will find out on Weds. Trying to keep it together and get a list of questions together but really feel like I have been left in limbo. I just want this over with. And I don't do well with crying. The tears start and don't want to stop. I'm not one of those people that can cry and then just look like nothing every happened. My youngest daughter came by this morning and I am sure she knew what was up but didn't say anything. And I am sure she is worried about herself. What are the odds of 2 out of 3 getting breast cancer? My daughter was give the BRCA test and it came back negative and our cancers are completely different but it sure does make me wonder. We are both dental assistants, worked in the same office, and sterilized instruments with the same carcinogenic chemicals. Hers was determined to be environmental but mine is hormonal. Sorry, I could go on and on but I'll leave it at this for now! Thanks for listening!",
