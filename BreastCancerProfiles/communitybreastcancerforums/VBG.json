You should definitely get a second or third opinion especially when it comes to your surgery and recon.  I moved my treatment to a major cancer center after my second dx and am very happy that I am now at a more \"cutting edge\" hospital with all the latest treatment options and tests.    I have now had a bi lat, recon and did my first chemo treatment 2 weeks ago.  I also had my ovaries removed so I can start AIs when chemo is done. This whole thing sucks!  Not sure why some of us are able to deal with this once and beat it and some of us need to keep fighting.  All I know is that I will continue to fight like hell to stay with my DH and kids ages 9 and 11!  Hang in there Gwen you can beat this thing and so can I!

As an FYI if your breast tissue is dense, which mine is too, it actually puts you at a significantly greater risk of BC.  That does not mean that you will ever get BC but is does mean you need to be very proactive and ask for/demand annual diagnostic tests which would be mammo and ultra sound.  Many top radiologist are now looking at MRI as the best screening tool for younger women with very dense tissue. My first cancer was only visible with ultrasound and my second was only visible on MRI.  I was 46 at inital dx and have very dense tissue.  Most likely you will be fine( and your husband will be right!) but it is always better to be sure!  Wishing you the best......

Good luck.",

I am now doing chemo, even though my second dx was still stage 1 grade 1 and no nodes.  I would not think that your wife needs chemo but she needs to be hyper vigilant about pushing to insure that she gets the best possible screening to insure that the cancer stays gone.  So at the end of the day we all make choices/decisions and hope they are the right ones.  With cancer nothing is for sure but by educating yourself and \"Pushing\" your docs for information/tests/screening we stand a much better chance of a healthy outcome!  You are off to a great start by using these boards and asking great questions.  I wish  you the best, Valerie ",

Given your history and your dense breast tissue (which is a significant risk factor in itself) I would push for more info.  Since the radiologist does not \"think\" it is cancer it does not sound like he is sure what it is! Never be afraid to push for answers, ask lot of questions and follow your own instincts! I wish you the best! Valerie",
