I was running at the time and I could sense my nipple burning, but it was only when I got back that I realised that it had bled. It was only a few drops so I thought it would be because of the friction with my bra. But today when I woke up I had scab all around my nipple and it was fairly cracked. I wasn't very worried but I decided to check the internet just in case. Every page I've looked at makes it seem as if I had breast cancer. Could this be possible? I'm only 19 and in every other sense I feel perfectly fine Log in to post a reply",
