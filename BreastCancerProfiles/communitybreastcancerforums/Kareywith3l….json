I had a mammo/us in 2009 due to a lump they found during a routine dr's Appt and I didn't get a biopsy at that time. (it's was a relief to here \"looks fine\") but now that I have developed a new lump/underarm pain and swelling, I'm kicking myself in the butt. If it turns out to be anything this time, I'll always wonder if I could have caught it sooner if I had been more proactive. :-( Just my 2 cents. Why have the worry live in your head if a small prick can fix it. (I mean the needle- not the dr....) :-) Karey",

Sorry you are going through this, and I sincerely hope that despite the suspected malignancy you receive benign results after your test Monday. My advice (unsolicited as it is) is to seize this weekend and have a blast. I know it's probably impossible but Monday could be the start of changes- probably will be regardless, as it will make you even more aware of changes and things going on in your body and hopefully you get benign results,and it makes it easier to see the pleasure in every regular day. So, try to have a rollicking good time, ignore your worries till Monday and bank on the best results possible. (hard to do, I know!) Wishing you the very best, try and have a good weekend- Karey",

None of mine end in a lump, but I have a lump next to the stringy bits that is super moveable. It tends to hide when they are trying to examine it. But as for the stringy bits, I didn't notice them- the dr pointed out there was a thickening in the area and that's what I feel. I still don't know if that's what he meant by thickening though. When I think of thickening, I pictured thicker skin like on elbows or heels. I am almost at the end of my three month wait and see (mid nov) and hopefully I'll figure it out then! I'm totally curious to hear from anyone else who have these and know what they are too. I have developed another lump in the other breast too, but it's completely different. It's right at 12:00, close to the center and rock solid. It's now about an inch across. It showed up about a week after I saw my dr last and I'm curious to see what the heck pops up that quick!

It\u2019s an inflammation of one or more milk ducts, much like an internal pimple. It may be painful, but often isn\u2019t. Have your doctor check it to see whether it\u2019s extensive enough that you need an antibiotic. Looks less frightening than the big C concern, but you should still see your dr. (in my humble opinion of course) Hope that eases your mind a touch, being worried super sucks. Karey",

Pretty sure that's what I read. But I agree with you, 15% is different that 5% or 2%. If they told me that there was a 2% chance it was nothing, I'd be ok to wait, but 15...probably would want far more definitive answers! As for lumps, I have one in my lb that moves easily and a fixed one in my rb. The left one is in the lower outside section and the right one is right at 12:00 directly next to my aerola. No diagnoses as of yet, I'm in a three month wait and see that ends mid November. I'm banking on cysts and fibro-thingys myself but I'll let you know! Karey",

Due to the incredible lack of doctors here, I went to the walk in clinic. I got lucky enough to see the same gp for the initial and follow up appt. and he made note on the file that I be allowed to know when he is working so I can return just to him instead of starting from scratch every time. It doesnt look infected, there's no additional redness or swelling or heat. It is just super odd that the only place I'm getting (ugh) pimples is over top of the spot with the lump. I'm nearly 38- acne just seems unfair. Gray hair, wrinkles and lumpy boobs seems like enough to deal with! K",
