I have had itchiness that drove me insane for 7 weeks and all the sudden slowly subsiding with nothing changing. My doc things its fibrocistic disease, and said to lay off caffeine, that would make it worse, but mam scheduled. I decided to test that theory out. I drank even more caffeine. I was only having coffee, and a half a DC a day. Now 10 ozs coffee, full diet coke and sometimes a half, the pain and itchiness subsides, not increases like she said it would if I drank more, if it is FC disease. So there! I say.. However, yes, my nipples used to poke out, be full. Now they sorta lay flat and inside now. Weird. Also the right one discharged clear fluid and the areola is much thicker on that one than the other. The other I can pick up the skin, this right one, I cant. I think the 3D will be great to have. Just know that the survival rate and outcomes are soooo much better these days. You will be in great hands and I will support you though this! Know you can come here any time to vent. It is good you are keeping up on this, given your family history. Hang in there and try not to worry. You got this!  Leslie",
