    "Content": "biscuitsmom19 wrote: Hi everyone, I have been lurking around on this forums for the past week, ever since I found this lump. Everyone seems so supportive and knowledgeable, so I decided to create an account and contribute, and hopefully get some advice/words of comfort/opinions on what's going on. Background: I am 27 years old. I have spent the past year in recovery from anorexia, during which I was severely underweight for 4 years and without a period for 3. Period just came back last year in May/June, and is now finally pretty regular again, now that I am at a healthy BMI and have been for a few months! I was diagnosed with osteoporosis a few years ago, and have put off getting my bone density scan checked again (high deductible insurance and I am in school/working part time so didn't think it was a priority). In March I had my annual physical, all blood work came back great. For about two months I have had a pain in my right leg/hip. My primary care doctor did some physical tests and figured it was just from my sprinting exercises on the treadmill. The pain only presents with physical exertion, mainly running. Walking is fine. My back has also been kind of aching but I figured it was just due to my mattress, as my husband complains about back pain from the mattress as well. So, Sunday night, I was laying in bed and don't know what exactly I was doing, but my arm brushed up against a large lump in my left breast, 6:00 position, right about where the underwire of my bra hits. I felt it and my heart skipped a beat. I had my husband feel it too, and he said he never noticed that before, and thinks he would have. I would say it's the size of a grape? But feels more oval shaped. So Monday, I called my gynecologist office and tried to get my yearly moved up. They were able to get me an appointment with another doctor at their practice on Thursday. She felt the lump and said \"Oh, probably a fibroadenoma, but I'm going to order an ultrasound to be sure. I wouldn't be worried, you're very young, but since it's new let's just get some imaging done.\" So the breast center is able to get me an appointment the next day, Friday. I go in for the ultrasound. The tech looks at it, takes pictures, and says she is going to have the radiologist look, and that she might come in to talk to me. Says this is normal procedure. The radiologist comes in and does another quick ultrasound herself. Then she tells me that it is definitely a solid mass, but she thinks fibroadenoma, as my doctor had said. But since it is new, she is recommending a core biopsy. I asked her if it was bad, if I should feel as panicked and anxious as I do! Her exact words were, \"I wouldn't lose any sleep over this. If I had to place money on it, I'd say benign. But I can't say that for absolutely sure without biopsy.\" So I scheduled the biopsy for Tuesday morning. Even with the radiologist saying that, I am still panicked. I am so scared that my leg/back pain coupled with this large lump means I have an aggressive, late stage breast cancer. I now feel like I am in pain all over, lower back, arm, shoulder, left armpit (?!), throat... I will add that my breasts look very normal/like they always have (well for the past few months anyway, I went from totally flat to a B cup in a year!). Skin is normal, not itchy, no nipple discharge or dimpling (the other scary symptoms I have been reading about). Thank you for taking the time to read this entire thing. I tried to be detailed, I guess I hoped it would feel good to write everything out. My husband is getting so annoyed with me for stressing like this. He said, \"if the doctor isn't worried, I'm not worried!\" But she was obviously worried enough to order the biopsy! I should also add, my paternal grandmother had a lump which turned out to be breast cancer. It was very easily treated, just a lumpectomy and radiation, and she has been cancer free for 30 years. At the time, apparently her doctor told her it was a type of breast cancer that would not cause increased risk for her daughters or granddaughters. My two aunts are in their late 40's/early 50's and no breast cancer scares or anything like that that I am aware of. Anyway, thank you again. If anyone has any reassurance, or feels like it's definitely a good thing that my radiologist said not to lose sleep/if that indicates I should be okay...please feel free to reply. I'm going to submit some assignments and try to pretend everything is normal! Log in to post a reply",
