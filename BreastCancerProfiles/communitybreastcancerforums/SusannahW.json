I probably could have worked, I just became extremely tired in the early evening, and had to go to bed around 8 at night. During the day I was not that tired, and my energy level was not really reduced. Hope this helps-I think you'll do fine at work.",

For most of us, recovery is smooth, my breast only got pink and red during tx, and now almost 3 weeks after rads it is almost back to normal, just a little residual redness and chafing if I wear a bra too long. Even those who do have SEs after tx eventually heal.",

It all takes a toll, especially in your case, when u are getting ready for the wedding. I felt ridiculous to be so upset over it, but I think the hardest part of rads is the emotional part of going in every day, and when that gets interrupted I felt lost. I felt fine once I got back on course.",
