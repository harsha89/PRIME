I went to my GP for a check-up, blood work, HIV test, the lot. At one stage I even considered asking him if he could do a blood test to check for cancer(!), I just knew something was amiss. My mother also had a premonition. She lives about 2 hours drive from me, and 2 days before I even madeÂ the appointment for a mammogram, she phoned to ask if I was happy. She said she just had this intense feeling of being very sorry for me. I also believe if we listen to our bodies, we'll know when something is wrong.",

The first Taxotere went so well, I felt great the day after, so good in fact that I took my mom out to breakfast! Once we got into the car and I looked in the rear view mirror, my face looked like a beetroot! My mom and I had a good giggle about it, and I wrote it off to the new face cream I was using. With the next treatment, the drip had just started, when it felt like an A-bomb exploded in my stomach and worked it's way up to the tip of my head. I never felt so hot in my face! The nursed acted very quickly though, and gave me steroids and put the drip very, very slowly. Then with my last treatment, they gave me a pre-med. Something to keep me from having the allergic reaction, but to no avail. Beetroot face again! I found it very scary, but ultimately it only last for a couple of seconds. Switching treatments were never even metioned... Janine",

      "Content": "Apr 26, 2012 07:11AM - edited Apr 26, 2012 07:14AM by CapeTownJanine Hi Laurie, Thank you so much for the reply. I feel much more relaxed about the upcoming treatment now. I never had Neulasta with chemo, as I cruised through treatment with relative ease. Hopefully that will be the case this time round too. As for the receptors, my onc did discuss it with me. She said that doing a biopsy of bone tissue will not reveal much, as the cells get damaged in the process, and unfortunately no affected lymph nodes can be seen on my CT's. So, for now, we're going to try Zometa, as well as radiation on a section of my spine, and see how it goes. I'm also scheduled for an oophorectomy at the end of May. I'll be switching from tamoxifen (was on it for 4.5 years) to an AI, Femara. Ironic how our perceptions change when faced with this disease. I'm so very thankful that I \"only\" have bone mets! And Hi fairweather9, Thank you for the good news re. SE's. I'm still working full time, and plan to carry on doing so. Minimal SE's would sure be a blessing! Is that your cat in the photo? Beautiful animal! Regards, Janine",
