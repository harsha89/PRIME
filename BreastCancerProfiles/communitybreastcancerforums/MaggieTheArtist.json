Monitored it since I have fibrocysitic breasts and usually lumps & bumps are tender (this one wasn't) and usually go away on their own after I have my period (this one didn't 2x). Long story short, it was time for my annual mammogram anyway, so they did a diagnositic one plus an ultrasound. Didn't get too much information from those other than yep, there's something there of unknown etiology. I had a breast reduction 3+ years ago and so my breast specialist said it's possible that it could be fat necrosis.. Monday they are taking the lump out and in the meantime, I am trying hard not to obsess... not easy! Has anyone had this procedure? BTW, I'm 42, only family history of breast cancer is my aunt (my dad's sister). Lots and of other cancer in the family though. Personal history of melanoma in situ which was removed last december.

      "Content": "MaggieTheArtist wrote: Hi all. Well I just wrote a VERY long post and it disappeared when I tried to post it. I think I took too long writing it up . Yesterday at my annual OB/GYN appt my DR found a lump in my breast. I felt it maybe a month ago but dismissed it, though in the back of my mind was a little concerned. I had a breast reduction Aug 1 2006 and my breasts have changed so much over the past 9 months. I scar very well -- I only have very small thin white lines -- I didn't take it seriously though, just thinking it's probably scar tissue. The lump is just above my nipple at about 11:00 o'clock if you're looking at me. Well, I go tomorrow for a mammogram and and an appointment with a breast specialist/surgeon immediately following. My OB said they would most likely biopsy it. (does anyone know -- if they were going to do it, would they do it then?) Anyway, when he found it I said something about it maybe being scar tissue from my surgery. He didn't think so. I was a bit taken back by his reaction because I know him to be a non-alarmist and was pretty shocked by his seriousness about the whole thing --though grateful for his taking it seriosly. My risk factors are pretty low near as I can figure: My Dad's sister is a breast cancer survivor, but there is no maternal history of breast cancer. My sister had her thyroid removed last year due to thyroid cancer and there is some evidence that there is a link b/w thyroid cancer and breast cancer but from what I can understand about it, the link is due to treatment? something like that. I am, however, a recovering alcoholic (have been in recovery for nearly 4 years)and apparently there IS a link between alcohol consumption and breast cancer . I do have a baseline mammogram. I've had an annual mammogram every year since 2004 after a fibrocystic breast diagnosis. Ironically enough, Friday will be one year since my last and I hadn't scheduled one for this year yet. I haven't had a mammogram since my breast reduction though and something funny I keep thinking about is how on earth are they going to get these itsy-bitsy teensy-weesy B-cups squished? I was DD+ before Well, thanks for letting me share. It feels good to get this down (twice! ). I'm so thankful that there is a forum for \"not diagnosed, but worried\" thank you for that! It makes me feel not so silly and not so tempted to give into my stoic, it's silly to worry or borrow trouble until I have the facts -- which of course is just denial that I'm worried. Glad to have a place where I can come and be worried without it being silly... does that makes sense???? Anyway, thanks again, Maggie Log in to post a reply",
