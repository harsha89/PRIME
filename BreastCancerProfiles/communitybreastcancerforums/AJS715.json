      "Content": "AJS715 wrote: I want to get a general consensus on how your discovered lump felt. Why? I discovered a pea-ish sized, hard, smooth round lump in my right breast on I believe Tuesday (9/11). On Friday (9/14) it had grown to a fingertip size, if you can imagine and remains that size now. Still hard, round and smooth. Pretty embedded in my breast tissue, though, so you can really only feel the top, but you don't have to \"dig\" much to find it. I also wanted to add that the only other \"symptom\" is that both of my breasts have been tender to the touch for almost 2 straight months, like the feeling pre-menstrual, but constantly. Removing my bra is a delightfully painful release haha! I have an ultrasound tomorrow at 9:00 AM and boy am I nervous. My aunt (dad's sister) is winning a pretty rough battle with breast cancer, so that worries me even more. Log in to post a reply",
