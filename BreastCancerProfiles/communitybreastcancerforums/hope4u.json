In 2000 I was diagnosed with DCIS on my right breast, stage 0.  On October 2007, the cancerous cells showed up on my left breast.  So it was an easy decision for me to go through with the bilateral mastectomy.  After the right breast was removed, they found a lot of calcification in it and my Surgeon stated it was a good decision for me to go through the bi.  Family history ... my Mom had breast cancer at age 50 (survived it) and my aunt at age 56 and died after 5 years. I only spent a couple of days in the hospital and had drains attached, one on each side.  They're not too bad just a bit of a nuisance when sleeping.  My drains were removed after a couple of weeks but the left side did not drain well.  So my surgeon had to aspirate and take the fluids out manually.  This worried me for a while.  But the fluids all finally drained and the site healed beautifully.  After surgery, you'll probably not be able to raise your arms.  There are exercises that can be done which I'm sure your doctor will give you.  I also opted to seek the help of a physical therapist to help get my arm movement back to normal.  It takes time, but just think that it's temporary and they'll go back to normal. Hope this helps ... just think that what you're going through is temporary .. and this too shall pass.",

I massage my legs and feet ... now they're not as painful as before ...  My Onc did not prescribe anything other than take B complex and make sure I stretch my muscles...  I decided to go to my physical therapist and asked help in getting my legs stronger again ... so I get massage treatment and some pilates type strech exercises including hand bike and bike exercises.  Walking a few minutes a day also helps. (I started going last week, 3x/week ... and there's already marked improvements.) In fact I'm so brave, that I scheduled a dance lesson this Saturday with my Latin ballroom teacher.  The question is ... how many times do I need to sit down and rest during the hour-long lesson    Life is a dance ....",

Wish we don't have to go through the SEs at all.",

Generally my body has a tendency to experience delayed reaction to treatments, etc.  So I'm assuming that it would take longer for my hair to grow back.  Luckily, I found a couple of wigs that suit me fine and don't bother me at all.   I also wear a half-wig with hats... those can be fun ...  So in the meantime ...while waiting for those ferocious hairs to grow back ... let's be thankful and keep on smiling ....  ",

The only thing I did which hopefully nobody will do, is have the chemo session the next day after the port is installed.  I had light anesthesia when the port was installed.  So the next day, I vomitted even before the chemo treatment started.  Then after the chemo, I had diarrhea.  I should have waited a few days ... oh well... Whatever you feel comfortable is the right decision for you ...",
