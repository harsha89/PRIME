Does anybody know if the D part is harder or easier.I don't have a picc line and I was wandering if the D part of the treatment is as hard on the veins as the red devil. I have a superficial clot from it and it hurts when I put my arm in a strait position, the oncologist sended me to hematology but they are not worried  . Anybody had this SE from chemo. I'm starting the D next Wednesday and I'm verry nervous. ",

I know everybody react differently to chemo but to know that for some people it was easier is very reassuring. The FEC gave me a lot of nausea so I'm glad to be done. Does anybody have trouble sleeping because of hot flashes? They give me zoladex every 28 days to put my ovaries to sleep because I was strongly positive to er/pr and with the chemo I think I get double wamy. Is there a good sleeping pill that is not addictive that I could ask my mo for?  Have a good night and thank again for the support . Alexandra",
