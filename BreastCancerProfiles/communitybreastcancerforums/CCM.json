I had no back pain just hamstring pain and some nerve pain on the right leg that we all thought was caused by some overexercise. It went on for about 2 months. I had Xrays and MRI's done of the hip and leg which showed nothing so I went off to PT. Only when my ortho ordered a lower lumbar MRI so she could give me an xray guided cortisone shot did we find the tumors. I am also TN. I just finished 16 radiation treatments right before Thanksgiving which along with nerve meds had reduced the pain by about 90%. Only this week now do I have a ache like pain again in the same left hip especially when I am sitting or in a hunched over position. Its like being tasered sometimes if I straighten up too quickly. I had an xray of the hip and it is negative so my Onc thinks it is inflammation or nerves healing/moving as a result of the radiation. I hope so!   I cannot imagine being in that level of pain again or being unable to walk/drive/sit and stand again. I am to start a trial in the coming weeks so am waiting for scans to be scheduled hopefully this week ( I am really hoping nothing new shows up and that the radiation worked since I also have some chest pain but it may be the result of cording on that side that I have since when I pinch the skin under the arm and stretch the pain goes away- dont have alot of muscle on that side so the skin is pretty stretched on the ribs).    Ask to have your tumor tested for AR+. Sloan Kettering is doing it and they cover the cost of testing your tumor for the androgen receptor. There is a TN trial for people with this androgen receptor that involves the drug bicalutamide. Its taken daily as a pill. Results look promising!    I myself am still trying to get a hold of this new diagnosis, I have a 5 year old and am devastated with this whole process so I wish you the best of luck:)",
