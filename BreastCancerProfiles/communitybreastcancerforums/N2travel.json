I have enjoyed reading your posts and it certainly does provide encouragement for me! I was dx after a excisional biopsy on May 10th with ILC and ILCS in my left breast. MRI showed two additional areas of suspicion and right breast showed enhancement. BS is highly recommending BMX which I agree with. I see PS today and see BS tomorrow. I'm praying my nodes are negative. It is such a comfort to know we are in this together!",
