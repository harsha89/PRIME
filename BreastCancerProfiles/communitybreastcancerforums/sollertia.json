The Juzo size I (extra small) works for me.  The Lymphediva sleeves do not fit because their small is 15 cm at the wrist.  I tend to swell in them.  I will wear them when I want the pretty color, but only with a Solidea wrist support under them I can wear them.  I found the Solidea sleeves are rated down to 13 cm. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F6BGWQY/ref=twister_B00F6BGWYG  I'm now under control with my husband doing a modified MLD on my arm each night before using the Solaris Tribute overnight and rotating the Solidea sleeves along with the Juzo sleeves, but using the Solidea gauntlets exclusively.  I found the Solidea gauntlets didn't cramp my hands nor pinch my thumb.   Not sure which portion of the massage, Tribute night sleeve or Solidea garments is doing the trick as they all started about the same time.",
