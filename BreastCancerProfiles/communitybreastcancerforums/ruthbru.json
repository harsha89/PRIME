The June 27 Time Magazine has a report on people who have sleep problems. Researchers report that cooling the brain may help problem sleepers drift off faster and sleep longer. The troubled sleepers wore specially designed caps that circulated water at cool temperatures. The chillier the water, the better those with insomina slept. This supports earlier findings that restless sleepers show higher than normal brain activity when they are trying to go to sleep, which raises their brain's temperature just as the body starts to cool off at the end of the day to promote sleep. So we want cool brains at night anyway!",

I just didn't know if I could face the thought of the additional surgeries, recovery time, possible problems, time lost from work etc. of reconstruction, and it made me really sad to think of not having a breast at all.....since my odds were the same either way (with radiation, of course).....everyone has such different feelings about this; but I would say if you are unsure, and you have the option, seriously consider the lumpectomy, it was the right choice for me.

This is just me, but I would have had a hard time being flat, but the more I have learned about the problems with reconstruction, the less I think that I could ever go through that process (and it is a process, not a one shot and you're done type of thing). Here is another post beesie did later with her thoughts on her reconstruction experience: \"What I've learned from having my MX is that a MX affects you for your lifetime. I'm more than 7 years out and there are days when the affect of my MX and reconstruction is still very noticeable to me - muscle aches, sore ribs, etc.. There are activities that I no longer do, or try to avoid, because of the reconstruction. How I felt about my MX and reconstruction when I first had my surgery (elated!), how I felt about it two years later (surprisingly disappointed), 5 years later (it is what it is) and now 7 years later (occasionally frustrated) has continued to change and evolve. I think that's important to understand because so much of what you read on this board is from people who have just completed the process, or who are still in the middle of the process. Whether they feel good about it or bad about it at this point in time could easily change as time goes on.\"",

Hope it helps: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\"",

I did dose dense,so they were every two weeks (mostly because I just wanted to get the whole thing over with as quickly as possible). I had my infusions Friday. I didn't do much over the weekend and was back to work on Monday. They had me take the heavy duty anti-nausea drugs the first three days, so Mondays were a little rocky & I planned that to be as easy of a day as possible. By Tuesday I was feeling pretty good & then continually better until the next round. It was easier for me to be there and feel kind of blah than to have to make two days of lesson plans! * edited to say that my infusion center was 100 miles away; if it had been in my same town, I would have tried to get the last appointment on Thursday afternoon.....that would have worked very well for my situation.",

Chemo is not fun, but remember, if you need it; chemo is like your own squad of Navy Seals, working FOR you to kill the terrorist cancer cells....because cancer will kill you, for sure, if it has a chance.",

I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\"",

Not that you don't get to feeling better all the time, but 'normal' definitely takes awhile.

Here are the reasons I choose a lumpectomy: * having a mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation have the same recurrence risk. * having a mastectomy is NOT a guarantee that you will not need radiation * a mastectomy is a more major surgery; with more possible complications, longer recovery time, more expense, time lost from work etc. etc. * I knew that if it turned out that I was uncomfortable with the results, a mastectomy would still be possible, but if I started with a mastectomy, there would be no going back. Once your breast are gone, they're gone. * a mastecomy either means you will need to learn to live breast-free, which is a difficult adjustment for many, or you will have to undergo more hassle, expense, pain, recovery time, possible side effects etc. etc. doing of reconstruction....which does not guarantee good or lasting results....blah! * when I was making my decision, I asked a friend who is a 35 year BC surivor and a surgical nurse. When she was diagnosed, you didn't have a choice...you had a mastectomy. Later, when it was widely available, she had reconstruction. So, she has seen BC from both sides of the operating table. When I asked for her opinion, she said (without skipping a beat), \"If you have the choice of a lumpectomy, TAKE IT.\" You are in the worst part now. Once you get a treatment plan in place, then you just do it...and come out on the other side. Best of luck!",

She lays out a very balanced view:  Beesie wrote: Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy.  I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others.  Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term.   Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates.  Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: No Survival Benefit For Mastectomy Over Lumpectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations:",

I took a week off when I had the lumpectomy and taught through 4 rounds of chemo. With the timing, my radiation was in the summer, but I could have definitely worked during it (several of my teacher friends did with no problems). After chemo, for me radiation was a walk in the park, and I could actually feel my energy returning during it. As others have said, work forced me to get out of the house and think about other things. Otherwise I would have just sat home being depressed about all this crap all day long. Of course, everyone's experience is different & there is no way to predict how your body, or mind, will react to any given treatment. But you will want to do what is recommended to do NOW so that you lower your chances as much as possible of ever having to go through this (and worse) ever again!",

Once your breast are gone, they're gone. Some things to think about: * I don't know what stats your doctor was taking about. Having a mastectomy or lumpectomy have the same recurrence risk. * having a mastectomy is NOT a guarantee that you will not need radiation * a mastectomy is a more major surgery; with more possible complications, longer recovery time, more expense, time lost from work etc. etc. * a mastecomy either means you will need to learn to live breast-free, which is a difficult adjustment for many, or you will have to undergo more hassle, expense, pain, recovery time, possible side effects etc. etc. doing of reconstruction....which does not guarantee good or lasting results....blah! * when I was making my decision, I asked a friend who is a 35 year BC surivor and a surgical nurse. When she was diagnosed, you didn't have a choice...you had a mastectomy. Later, when it was widely available, she had reconstruction. So, she has seen BC from both sides of the operating table. When I asked for her opinion, she said (without skipping a beat), \"If you have the choice of a lumpectomy, TAKE IT.\" * After a lumpectomy, the fat in your breast moves around and tends to fill in the spots (which takes awhile...like a year for me). I had a pretty large tumor, and I guess the results don't look great if I'm naked, but I look fine in clothes, & since I don't generally run around nude, nobody else can tell the difference. You are in the worst part now. Once you get a treatment plan in place, then you just do it...and come out on the other side. Best of luck!",

Dose Dense because I wanted to get it over with as quickly as possible. I don't know if that would be a possibility for you or if it's something you would even want to ask about. I liked getting Neulasta shots (which you have to do if you do dose dense, but I was glad to have them because it kicked my white blood cells into production so that I didn't have to worry about getting sick and could pretty much live my regular life (I didn't feel great, but I didn't feel unbearably awful either). Some general chemo tips: *get a dental checkup before you start, get your teeth cleaned etc. so that you don't have any unexpected dental issues to deal with while on treatment * Dove soap is the mildest, Biotene toothpaste & mouthwash are very gentle on your teeth, you might want to keep your fingernails and toenails polished as that keeps them stronger. * drink lots & lots of water, take the anti-nausea drugs exactly as directed, get a number to call if you have any problems, if they haven't talked about it, I would seriously consider getting a port to protect your veins. 2. Hair: *Use Nioxin shampoo, conditioner & scalp treatments for chemically treated hair while on chemo (even when you don't have hair, your hair follicles are being chemically treated from the inside out!), after chemo switch to the Nioxin for regular hair until your hair is coming in nicely, then switch back to your regular hair products. *you might want to switch to a shorter style right now to give you and the world time to get used to a shorter look, * there are some really nice, light-weight wigs out there. If you want to go with one, go to a salon that does that kind of thing and have them work with you, there are also nice scarves and also hats with bangs which make you look like you have hair. I guess I am pretty vain because always wore my wig in public (which looked totally natural.....actually nicer than my 'real' hair). * I don't know if the American Cancer Society has a 'Look Good, Feel Better' program where you live; but if you can get to one, they show you makeup tips, hair tips etc. Nowadays, you can probably find clips on utube about all that too. Weirdly, I didn't lose my eyebrows or lashes until two weeks AFTER I was done with chemo (this happened to another friend too). They grew back quickly, but I drew on the eyelashes & being it was summer, wore sunglasses whenever possible! Big earring, red lipstick, bright clothes can all take the focus off the eyes. Balance: I kept working, which not everyone can, or wants, to do. But I felt like I would go crazy if I just sat around thinking about cancer all day long. Whether you work or not, have a schedule and plan to do things (you can always cut it short or call something off if you feel crappy, but generally you feel better when you are out doing things). * I did accept all offers to bring me meals, do errands etc. This is a time to say 'Yes' to help. You could tell your friends that you want them to ask you to go out for coffee, a movie etc. Explain that you might not have the energy to make the plans but would love to be included. It's okay to tell people what you need right now. I also hired a cleaning lady! * I kept exercising (at a reduced level). Even if you can only do slow walks....anything you can do now will help you bounce back more quickly and thoroughly once you are done. These are some things that helped me. You are in the hardest time; once you have a plan in place, you just do it and get it over with. Hang in there! Ruth",

I am copying over a post put together by beesie, on of the resident experts on the boards. It gives a good, non-partial list of things to consider as you work your way through this. Best of luck! \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\"",

If she does opt for surgery, a lumpectomy under the lightest anesthesia possible, and no future treatment would seem to be the choice with the best chance of survival.

Some Older Women With Hormone-Receptor-Positive Disease May Be Able to Skip Radiation After Lumpectomy    In most cases, the usual treatment for early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer is lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by about 6 weeks of radiation therapy (you receive treatment 5 days per week) to destroy any cancer cells that may have been left behind after surgery. This two-step approach reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence (the cancer coming back). But in 2004, this treatment approach changed for older women. Large studies showed that while lumpectomy plus radiation did reduce the rate of recurrence among older women, it didn\u2019t improve overall survival. Overall survival is how long the women lived, whether or not the cancer came back. So the National Comprehensive Cancer Network modified its treatment guidelines: radiation therapy became optional for women ages 70 and older diagnosed with early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer who take hormonal therapy medicine for 5 years or more after lumpectomy. Doctors then wondered if certain postmenopausal women younger than 70 also might be able to skip radiation after lumpectomy. They also wondered what the rate of recurrence was among these women who skipped radiation. New research suggests that the rate of recurrence among women 65 and older diagnosed with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive disease who are taking hormonal therapy is low; these women may be able to skip radiation after lumpectomy.

      "Content": "Apr 16, 2016 07:39PM - edited Apr 17, 2016 05:04AM by ruthbru I am nine years out so can look at things pretty objectively. Like anyone in their right mind, I did NOT want to do chemo, it drove me crazy to think that maybe I was doing something I didn't need......but since I am not a gambler, and I was talking about my very life.....I went ahead with it while thinking of it as an insurance policy. You buy it hoping you never need to use it. The other thing is....if I hadn't done it, and it came back, then I would blame myself, now I would consider it as fate. For me chemo wasn't that bad. I continued to work full time and do everything I had to do and most of the things I wanted to do too. I have had no long term side effects from it. (of course, there is no guarantee with that, which is why it is so scary; it's like jumping off a cliff into the unknown). I also did 5 years of Arimidex and did fine on that too. With anti-hormonals, the good thing is that if you have trouble with one, you can try another or even quit (another reason to consider chemo is that some people do have a horrible time with the anti-hormonals and really can not take them because of quality of life issues. So if you have done chemo it is kind of like a safety net in case that would happen). For me, the end definitely justified the means. I had one really hard year, and (so far....knock on wood) 8 really, really great ones. I've got to see my DS graduate from high school, college, get a good job, buy his first house, I've got to finish out a wonderful career the way and wanted to and enjoy the last 3 years of a rewarding retirement, I've traveled to new places and have gotten to go back to old places I love. I've taken chances that I never would have dared to take before (because, what's the worse that could happen?). Because I work hard at it (and luck), my health is better than it ever been. I am so entirely grateful for whatever part of treatment, or the combination of treatments, that worked, and has given me this bonus time. Do now what you will not regret later, no matter what happens.",

A mastectomy is a major surgery, with all the attending risks of any major surgery, and a lot longer recovery time (not to mention that if your breast is important to you sexually and/or self-image wise, you will have to deal with those issues as well). If you are thinking of reconstruction; that is even more time, more money, more hassle, more risks of complications etc etc..

If you are leaning toward a lumpectomy, do it. (I am sad to say that I think surgeons are neutral because they make more money if you go the more complicated route.) You could always change your mind later and have a mastectomy if you aren't happy with the results. But once your breasts are gone, they are gone forever. I had a lumpectomy and am even more glad and relieved that if what I did now than I was at the time. I would have been sad not to have breasts, but don't think I could have gone through all the additional surgeries, pain, healing time, possible side effects, and uncertain results of reconstruction (I almost faint when I read through some of the reconstruction threads.....I don't do medical 'stuff' well.) added to note that being ER & PR negative will probably mean chemo, which would actually be another 'pro-lumpectomy' reason. You will have enough on your plate already without adding major surgery.",

I was able to work through 4 rounds of dose dense AC with neulasta shots. I would take Friday off for infusions, not do much over the weekend and be back to work on Monday. I didn't feel good, sort of like I had a slight case of the flu, but if you faithfully take your anti-nausea medicine you shouldn't be throwing up or anything like that. I was able to do everything I had to do, and most of the things I wanted to do too (going to son's sports events, band concerts etc. but bowing out of chaperoning the post-prom party come to mind). Some tips that helped me: 1. If you feel like you need to have 'hair' for your job (which I certainly did), get a great wig in place before you lose your hair 2. get as many 'extra' type projects that are coming up done before you start your leave, so when you come back you will be a little ahead (or at least not so far behind) 3. take everyone who offers you help up on their offers. If they say, \"Let me know if I can help.\" Tell them EXACTLY what they can do that will help. My coworkers brought meals a couple times a week and I really appreciated not having to deal with food. 4. I tried to keep my son's life as normal as possible. I was glad that he was at an age where he was busy with school, work, friends etc. I did try to spend quiet, hanging out time with him watching movies and things like that to keep us connected 5. Do some gentle exercises, walk etc. even if you don't at all feel like it, it will actually make you feel better (and bounce back better afterwards) 6. I felt not good the first 3 days, and gradually more and more normal, the second week I felt pretty good (in fact went to my nieces graduation weekend 500 miles away between round 3 and 4). I felt that mentally I was much better off working. If I had sat home, I would have just dwelt on everything and felt sorry for myself. Everyone is different. You have to listen to your body, but I would say to go into it expecting that you will do well and try to keep as normal of a schedule as possible (and that includes doing fun things, not just work). If you need to cut back, you always can. Best of luck! Ruth",

Just a (sad) thought about kids......one should not get pregnant on tamoxifin, and if you take it for the prescribed 5 years.....you will be pretty much out of the biological child phase of life even without chemo.

Near the end, when I was hot, I slept with a fan trained right on my boob and also got a little tiny fan which I could prop on my lap and blow under my shirt when I was sitting around watching TV etc.",

My hair was really, really cute and curly for about a year (and easy to work with as coss says), and then, vitually ovrernight, it got frizzy, an when I went in and got a layer cut, it was back to straight! One kind of funny thing; when I first went out shopping with my curly hair, a clerk commented on how cute it was and asked me if my hair was naturally curly. She must have thought I was kind of slow because I couldn't figure out how to answer.....finally stammering, \"Um....................yes.\"",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2017 09:11PM - edited Apr 22, 2017 09:12PM by ruthbru Here is an old post I wrote on LE (on an exercise thread, which is why there is so much about exercise in it), maybe it will be helpful for you: I had 11 lymph nodes removed, so this (LE) has always been an area of real concern and mindfulness for me. When I had my surgery, there was no one around here to go to for advice, so I did a lot of studying on my own. Here are some thoughts & tips I came up with. First, I think that whether or not you are prone to LE has mostly to do with how your lymph system handles trauma. I would say most cases (unless you are in a horrible accident or are doing really extreme activities) are neither through any virtue or fault of your own; just a matter of good or bad 'luck'. That being said, there are many 'little' things that we can do that may reduce the risk of developing LE or minimize flares (these are for people with SNB too): The list above was my original post, now I will add a couple other thoughts. I understand where you are coming from because in the beginning, I think I was almost as afraid of getting Lymphedema as I was of actually dying....yikes. But a couple things happened; one was time passed without me developing LE, and second is that I got to know several people who had developed LE and saw that even though it added something that was a hassle to their lives; they kept on living, exercising, traveling.....doing all the things that make life enjoyable.....despite of it. So, be mindful but don't let the thought of it rule your life. If it doesn't happen, you will have wasted all that energy worrying for nothing, if it does despite sensible precautions, then you will deal with it at that time.",

      "Content": "May 1, 2011 01:31PM ruthbru wrote: Here is a recent newspaper column about shingles by Dr. Gott. He apparently wrote a column in March with recommendations on who should not receive the vaccine. So here are his readers questions from that column and his response: DEAR DR. GOTT: I just took the shingles vaccine at a local drugstore. I filled out papers but nowhere did it mention that anyone who had a history of cancer should not take the vaccine. Please advise. DEAR DR. GOTT: In your recent column, you said that the shingles vaccine should not be given to former cancer patients. I am in remission from large B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. I have Wegener's granulomatosis, which although in remission, is still there. The Wegener's is the reason that a shingles vaccine is recommended. I will be having CD19 level blood testing before any vaccination, but with my history, should I still have the vaccine? DEAR DR. GOTT: I read your recent article regarding the shingles vaccine with much interest. My doctor recommended the vaccine for me; however, I am reluctant to get it. My concern is that I understand the vaccine is formulated with live virus and my white blood count is below normal. Neither my doctor nor a pharmacist was able to comment on this. DEAR DR. GOTT: I read your article that the shingles vaccine is not right for everyone. I am 65 now and I had ovarian cancer 25 years ago with chemotherapy on weekends once a month for a year. Your article said I shouldn't have the vaccine because I had cancer. Does this hold true for me even though I had cancer so long ago? Also, I can't remember if I had chickenpox. Please advise. DEAR DR. GOTT: I am a white male, age 58-1/2. I had chickenpox as a child and suffered with a classic case of shingles in February 2010. I received a prescription at a cost of about $300 for 21 pills, seven days' worth, that helped tremendously. I asked my doctor at that time about the vaccine, and he said he had not studied the vaccine enough yet, as it was new in February 2010. Could you please enlighten me about new information regarding this vaccine or where to go for new information about it because I don't want the discomfort again? DEAR DR. GOTT: I read your column on the shingles vaccine with interest. However, I am wondering why you stated that those undergoing radiation for cancer or with a history of cancer should not have it. In 2009, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. I also turned 60 that year and asked my oncologist about having the shingles vaccine. He said I could have it as long as I waited one month after I finished chemotherapy. I was undergoing radiation at the time when I had the vaccine and seem to have no issues as a result. Have I done myself harm or is the vaccine or effective? Also, if the vaccine only lasts six years, should I have another when I am 66 or avoid it owing to my cancer history? DEAR READERS: Thank you all for writing. When I wrote this article, I acquired the information from reputable sources to include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that specifically indicates people with a weakened immune system because of HIV/AIDS or another disease that affects the immune system, treatment with drugs that affect the immune system, cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy, a history of cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system such as leukemia or lymphoma, and women who are or might be pregnant should not get the vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration mirrors this and states conditions such as cancer of the lymph, bone or blood and those with a weakened immune system caused by treatments such as radiation should not be immunized. Drugs.com indicates if a person has leukemia or lymphoma (or other cancer affecting bone marrow) or a weakened immune system caused by disease or by receiving medication such as steroids or chemotherapy, they should not take the vaccine. The Mayo Clinic indicates the vaccine isn't recommended if a person has a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDs, lymphoma or leukemia or is receiving immune system-suppressing drugs such as steroids, radiation or chemotherapy and more. The website www.Zostavax.com indicates that patients should not get the vaccine if they have a weakened immune system. MedlinePlus indicates a person who has a weakened immune system because of treatment with drugs that affect the immune system such as prolonged use of high-dose steroids, cancer treatment such as radiation or chemotherapy, cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system such as leukemia or lymphoma should not get the vaccine. Therefore, I stand by my original March statement that indicated there are some people who should not receive the vaccine. However, that said, I defer to each reader's oncologist, hematologist or other specialists who may have a different view on the subject. Thank you all for writing. ",

One morning, my sister had fed the animals as usual and was driving into town, when to her horror she saw Snowball's body lying on the side of the road. She pulled over and with tears streaming down her face cried, \"Oh Snowball, how can you be so dead when I just fed you?\" She got a blanket from the trunk, gently wrapped up Snowball, drove home, got a shovel from the garage, said a little prayer and buried the cat under a beautiful old tree in the backyard. She sadly walked back toward the house, and almost dropped dead herself when she looked up to see Snowball staring out the patio window at her!!! Snowball was, indeed, still alive, and some poor cat had just gotten a very nice send off.",

It gives a good, non-partial list of things to consider as you make your decisions: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for  someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy,  mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy.  I've posted this many times now  and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input  from many others.  Some women have gone through the list and decided to  have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others  have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help  women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term.  Before getting to that list, here is some research that  compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach.  If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research  has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the  breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast  cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of  surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't  affect survival rates.  Here are a few studies that compare the  different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast  Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How  someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had  might be very different than how you will feel about it and the  experience that you will have.  So try to figure out what's best for  you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most  easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options.  Good  luck with your decision!\"  ",

Take your lead from your kids; some will want more details, some will not. Try to keep their lives as normal as possible. Enlist the help of friends, family, co-workers, church friends etc. Tell them what you need. Could they do some of the running, dropping kids off for practices etc., invite the younger kids over for playdates, could they bring meals (my co-workers had a food sign up and brought meals over several times a week when I was doing chemo....that was a lifesaver for me....probably for the family too because I sure didn't feel like cooking). Let some things go; things don't have to be as clean, eating fast foods is OK etc. I also did more watching movies, video games etc. than I usually would have allowed.....because they were things where we could be together but didn't wear me out.  Another thing that I think is important. In the fall, let their schools know what is going on. The school counselor can be a great resource and support for your children, and if their teacher's know what is going on, they will be able to give them some TLC and maybe a break if they are struggling. It is tough, but you can be a wonderful role model for your children. Bad things happen to everyone, and if they see that you handle this with resolve and faith, then that is how they will handle their challenges as well. Sending along hugs for all!",

I was in the same boat as you, my surgeon just mentioned a mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation; and since my lymph nodes were clear, I was totally SHOCKED when the oncologist recommended chemo; but after seeing the numbers, I knew I had to do it & am glad that I did.

I guess if it were left to me; I'd be in the 'let's hit it with everything we can NOW' mindset too. After doing chemo, I found radiation to be a piece of cake. I started radiation about 3 weeks after finishing chemo......it is a whole different thing, I didn't feel sick or fatigued or anything from rads (chemo would be a whole different story). Best of luck! Ruth computer froze up & then copied the same post twice, sorry!",

As far as homeschooling.....if you are already doing it & have friends who could take over some of the responsibilities, I would put that in place. Another option I will just throw out is......a couple in my town who homeschooled was faced with a somewhat similar situation & enrolled their kids in a local private school (Catholic, in this case) for a year & then resumed homeschooling once everything had settled down.

The thing that would make me think of adding the 'A' if I were you, is that you are really young, have a long life ahead of you and you'll never want to have to do this again! About the heart damage with 'A'. It is very rare, especially when you are in good shape going in, and according to my oncologist anyway, shouldn't be a problem with the limited dose early stage women get.",

Here is her very non-biased and informational post of the subject: Quite a while back, I put together a long list of questions to hopefully assist anyone making this decision. We are all different in how we see these choices, so rather than base your decision on what someone else did, this list is meant to take you through the pros and cons of each option, so that you can figure out what's important to you personally, leading to a decision that is right for you. Here is a copy of my earlier post, with a few updates and some new / more recent research upfront. ***************************************************************************************************************** Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Please note that this list is written for women who have invasive cancer (Stage I or above).Some of the decision factors are different for women who have pure DCIS (Stage 0). A different version of this list, written specifically for women with DCIS, is available in my post on the first page of this discussion thread in the DCIS Forum: 'Topic: lumpectomy vs mastectomy - why did you choose your route?'. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has generally shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. The reason that the choice of surgery doesn't affect survival is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't generally affect survival rates. There have been a few more recent studies that have however shown different results. A couple of studies have shown that survival might actually be higher for those who have a lumpectomy, possibly because these women usually also have radiation, whereas women who have a MX don't usually get rads. But another recent study suggested that younger women may benefit, in terms of long term survival, from a MX. Here are a number of the studies that compare the different surgical approaches: (Note that a number of these articles are from Medscape, and you will have to register with them to be able to view the articles.) April 2016 Is breast conserving therapy or mastectomy better for early breast cancer? and August 2016 (this is another write-up of the same study as above) Young Patients With Early Breast Cancer Live Longer With Mastectomy December 2015 Ten-Year Data: Lumpectomy and Radiotherapy Trump Mastectomy December 2014 No Survival Benefit for Increasingly Used Bilateral Mastectomy January 2013 Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy October 2002 Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer October 2002 Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: If your cancer isn't near the chest wall and if your nodes are clear, then it may be possible to avoid radiation if you have a mastectomy. This is a big selling point for many women who choose to have mastectomies. However you should be aware that there is no guarantee that radiation may not be necessary even if you have a mastectomy, if some cancer cells are found near the chest wall, or if the area of invasive cancer is very large and/or if it turns out that you are node positive (particularly several nodes). It is very important to understand that your choice of surgery \u2013 lumpectomy, mastectomy or bilateral mastectomy \u2013 will not change the recommendation as to whether or not you should have chemo, Herceptin (if HER2+) or endocrine (hormone) therapy (if ER+). So you can't avoid any of these treatments - if your MO believes they are necessary - by opting to have a MX or BMX. (Note that the exception is women with DCIS or possibly very early Stage I invasive cancer, who may be able to avoid Tamoxifen by having a mastectomy or a BMX.) For most women, a lumpectomy is a relatively easy surgery and recovery. After a lumpectomy, radiation usually is given for 6 weeks. A mastectomy is a longer, more complex surgery and the recovery period is longer. For most patients the side effects of rads are not as difficult as they expected, but most women do experience some side effects. You should be prepared for some temporary discomfort, fatigue and skin irritation, particularly towards the end of your rads cycle. Most side effects go away a few weeks after treatment ends but if you have other health problems, particularly heart or lung problems, you may be at risk for more serious side effects. This can be an important consideration and should be discussed with your doctor. If so, be aware that reconstruction, even \"immediate\" reconstruction, is usually a long process - many months - and most often requires more than one surgery. Some women have little discomfort during the reconstruction process but other women find the process to be very difficult - there is no way to know until you are going through it. Some lucky women breeze through reconstruction but unfortunately, many have complications. These may be short-term and/or fixable or they may be long-term and difficult to fix. Common problems include ripples and indentations and unevenness. You may have lingering side effects (muscle pain, spasms, itching, etc.) on one side or both (if you have a BMX). If you don't end up with symmetry (symmetry is not a sure thing by any means, even if you have a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction done on both sides at the same time), will you regret the decision to remove your breasts or your healthy breast? Are you prepared for the possibility of revision surgery? A reconstructed breast is not the same as a real breast. Some women love their reconstructed breasts while some women hate them. Most probably fall in-between. Reconstructed breasts usually looks fine in clothing but may not appear natural when naked. They may not feel natural or move naturally, particularly if you have implant reconstruction. If you do choose to have a MX or BMX, one option that will help you get a more natural appearance is a nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). Not all breast surgeons are trained to do NSMs so your surgeon might not present this option to you. Ask your surgeon about it if you are interested and if he/she doesn't do nipple sparing mastectomies, it may be worth the effort to find a surgeon who does do NSMs in order to see if this option is available for you (your area of cancer can't be right up near the nipple). Are your breasts and nipples important to you sexually? A MX or BMX will change your body for the rest of your life and you have to be prepared for that. Keep in mind as well that even if you have a nipple sparing mastectomy, except in rare cases, the most feeling that can be retained in your nipples is about 20% - the nerves that affect 80% of nipple sensation are by necessity cut during the surgery and cannot be reconnected. Any breast/nipple feeling you regain will be surface feeling only (or phantom sensations, which are actually quite common and feel very real); there will be no feeling inside your breast, instead your breast will feel numb. For some, loss of breast/nipple sensation is a small price to pay; for others, it has a huge impact on their lives. Some women are glad that their breast(s) is gone because it was the source of the cancer, but others become angry that cancer forced them to lose their breast(s). How do you think you will feel? Don't just consider how you feel now, as you are facing the breast cancer diagnosis, but try to think about how you will feel in a year and in a few years, once this diagnosis, and the fear, is well behind you. For the first year or two after diagnosis, most women get very stressed when they have to go for their screenings. The good news is that usually this fear fades over time. However some women choose to have a BMX in order to avoid the anxiety of these checks. Will you feel that the cancer is gone because your breast(s) is gone? Or will the loss of your breast(s) be a constant reminder that you had breast cancer? Is the risk level you will face after a lumpectomy + rads one that you can live with or one that scares you? Will you live in constant fear or will you be comfortable that you've reduced your risk sufficiently and not worry except when you have your 6 month or annual screenings? If you'll always worry, then having a mastectomy might be a better option; many women get peace of mind by having a mastectomy. But keep in mind that a MX or BMX does not mean that you no longer need to remain vigilant; you must continue to be checked for breast cancer. Although for most women the recurrence risk after a MX is low, anyone can still be diagnosed with a recurrence or a new primary breast cancer even after a MX or BMX. This is because it is impossible for the surgeon to remove every cell of breast tissue; some breast tissue always remains even after a MX or BMX, around the edges of the breast, or just a few cells against the chest well or the skin. Be aware too that while a mastectomy may significantly reduce your local (in the breast area) recurrence risk, it has no impact whatsoever on your risk of distant recurrence (i.e. mets). Is this a risk level that scares you? Or is this a risk level that you can live with? Keep in mind that breast cancer very rarely recurs in the contralateral breast so your current diagnosis doesn't impact your other breast. However, anyone who's been diagnosed with BC one time is at higher risk to be diagnosed again with a new primary breast cancer (i.e. a cancer unrelated to the original diagnosis) and this may be compounded if you have other risk factors. Find out your risk level from your oncologist. When you talk to your oncologist, determine if genetic testing might be appropriate for you based on your family history of cancer and/or your age and/or your ethnicity (those of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at higher risk for BRCA mutations). Those who are found to have a genetic mutation may be at very high risk to get BC again and for many women, a positive genetic test result is a compelling reason to have a bilateral mastectomy. On the other hand, for many women a negative genetic test result helps with the decision to have a lumpectomy or single mastectomy rather than a bilateral. Talk to your oncologist and determine if you should see a genetic counselor. Don't assume that you know what your risk is; you may be surprised to find that it's much higher than you think or much lower than you think (my risk was much less than I would ever have thought). Will you regret your decision and wish that you'd had a bilateral mastectomy? Or will you be grateful for the extra time that you had with your breasts, knowing that you made the best decision at the time with the information that you had? Will you question (either immediately or years in the future) why you made the decision to have the bilateral? Or will you be satisfied that you made the best decision with the information you had? Consider as well how you might feel if your reconstruction is difficult and the results not to your expectations. I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!",

But this last month my hair grew like a WEED, so much so when I went in for a haircut tonight, my hairdresser said, \"Have you changed your diet? Your hair has grown amazingly fast this month?!!!!\" Well, I have done something differently: I've started eating 2 ounces of at least 70% cocoa dark chocolate every day because it is suppose to be good for you; lower your blood pressure, cholestreol etc. That's the only thing I've done differently! So, I have no scientific evidence at all, but if anyone wants to try it and see if their hair grows faster......how cool would that be if it works!!  Ruth",

Tests he didn't enjoy. As time went by, both his mental (dementia) and physical health deteriorated to the point where it wouldn't have made sense for him to have further surgery even if a problem had been detected (as the surgery itself would have most likely killed him). I brought up this point to his doctor (I was the medical power of attorney), but if I hadn't pressed the point, the needless and expensive testing would have continued. If your mom still has her mental faculties, then it is her decision to make. If not, then it will be up to you to decide quality of life issues.....pain management is very important, no matter what else you decide, so I would be agressive in insisting on that as a priority.",

You can go on cancermath.com and put in your own stats for a rough estimate, but doctors can use the following site. I am copying over what their web page (adjuvant online) says: \"The purpose of Adjuvant! is to help health professionals and patients with early cancer discuss the risks and benefits of getting additional therapy (adjuvant therapy: usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or both) after surgery. The goal is to help health professionals make estimates of the risk of negative outcome (cancer related mortality or relapse) without systemic adjuvant therapy, estimates of the reduction of these risks afforded by therapy, and risks of side effects of the therapy. These estimates are based on information entered about individual patients and their tumors (for example, patient age, tumor size, nodal involvement, histologic grade, etc.) These estimates are then provided on printed sheets in simple graphical and text formats to be used in consultations. Because of the complexity of interpretation of some of the input information (ambiguities about tumor size, margins, etc.), the information should be entered by a health professional with some experience in oncology (cancer medicine).\" Insist your doctor go on the site, enter your information using each protocol (preferably while you are sitting there), print it out and go through it with you.  ",

It gives a good, non-partial list of things to consider as you make your decisions: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for  someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy,  mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy.  I've posted this many times now  and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input  from many others.  Some women have gone through the list and decided to  have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others  have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help  women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term.  Before getting to that list, here is some research that  compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach.  If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research  has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the  breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast  cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of  surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't  affect survival rates.  Here are a few studies that compare the  different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast  Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How  someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had  might be very different than how you will feel about it and the  experience that you will have.  So try to figure out what's best for  you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most  easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options.  Good  luck with your decision!\" ",

So, naturally, if I see one of them has started a post, or written a reply to a post; I will check it out because I am interested to see what they have to say. And although I might not be at the same 'stage'; if someone posts a question about chemo, or radiation, or Armidex; these are things I have been through and may possibilty be able to give some advise on or give a comment about my experience that might be helpful to someone. I also have too many local friends at all 'stages'; I have encourage them to check out BCO, but not all do.

Get a notebook, start writing down questions. Go to the home page here and look up and print out all the treatment option information and bring it with you to appointments.

I think a key for me was that I kept up with exercise as much as I was able during both chemo and rads. Use whatever lotion they recommend right from the start. Don't wait until you start to get red. I'd bring a little tube into the changing room and slap some on right when I was done, and again before I went to bed. Do NOT put it on in the morning before you get zapped, as that can intensify the burn. Get some fans. I got pretty red and felt hot at the end (but no blistering or peeling), so I would sit with a fan blowing right on my boob area, which felt good.

I had a 4 cm tumor removed and then had another surgery where they went back in to get a better margin. I am a little lopsided, but not as bad as I thought I'd be. It took about a year, but the fat shifted around and filled in the space pretty good. Wearing a good bra, you can't tell the difference. Wearing a sports bra, you'd have to be staring directly at my chest in a kind of creepy way to tell the difference. I wanted as little surgery & as short of a recovery time as possible. I did not want to spend any more time dealing with reconstruction and reconstruction issues (but enjoy having breasts). I am 100% happy with my choice. I did rads without any problems, had mammograms twice a year for the first couple years, but then went back to once a year just as before cancer. I would say that if you really, truly aren't sure what to do; you should have the lumpectomy and see how you feel/look. If you are unhappy, you could still have a mastectomy; but once your breasts are gone.....they're gone.",

Just a word of caution, don't freak out at the initial results. When I first had surgery, I was shocked by how it looked, but give it some time (like up to a year) because the fat shifts around and fills in the gaps pretty well. My example is a shelf cup bathing suit; I had surgery in early March & could not wear the suit that summer because the size difference was really noticeable. I loved that suit though, so kept it, and by the next summer I could wear it again. You can get a partial breast prosthesis if you feel like you need it to fill out your bra cup (you can have your doctor write a prescription and insurance will pay for it). I did use one for awhile after surgery, but eventually didn't need it any more. Best of luck!",

The finding out, surgery, deciding what you have to do is the very worst part. Your breast will hurt for a long time, but if you think you might still have an infection, be sure to get it checked out (I made friends with my surgeon's nurse and made many, many calls to her and several visits too). I slept in a recliner for a long time as that seemed more comfortable to me. What happens with the fat in your breast is that it 'settles' and does fill out the gaps. My tumor was on the bottom of my breast, so at first it looked like someone had sliced the whole bottom of my boob off (I suppose because that is what they did!), but after about a year, I noticed that it had filled out and now I'd say my breasts are pretty much the same size again (although I couldn't go bra-less even if I wanted to because the nipples are a little off). As far as checkups go;  I had a mammogram on the 'bad' side every six months for the first couple years and am now back to once a year on both sides. Also for the first couple years, they have you go back for rechecks with the oncologist every couple months, where they do blood tests, tumor marker tests etc. After a couple years, you 'graduate' to checkups every six months and, I believe, that after five years you only have to go back once a year.

      "Content": "Aug 22, 2010 12:32AM - edited Aug 22, 2010 08:17AM by ruthbru I did 4 rounds of AC without problems; my doctor explained that my doses were below the level that could cause heart problems (I believe he said if you would have more than 6 treatments of A, then you start to get in trouble; they calibrate any individual session's dose with your weight). Also there are studies which have shown that if you exercise while on Adriamycin, that reduces your chances of any heart damage even more. I think if you are in good shape going in, stay as active as you can be during, and resume a good exercise routine after; then you should be fine. You really need to do everything you can to get rid of this disease NOW;  if it comes back you will be doing chemo for the rest of your life and heart diease will be the furthest thing from your mind. Best of Luck! Ruth",

I also liked the fact that by staying local; I didn't have to deal with travel, I knew my nurses and they knew me, DH and I could drive home and I could be in my bed 10 minutes after I was released etc., also follow up was easier. For me, that is what worked best. edited to add that the surgeons weren't worried about the time-line, but my GP was very insistent that we take care of it ASAP.",

My fourth chemo was about a week after the school year was over, but I taught throughout the other three. I would have my infusions on Fridays, neulasta shots Saturday morning and be back to work on Monday. They gave me heavy duty anti-nausea drugs for the first three days. I felt pretty crummy on Mondays but then would feel better each day until the next round. I got really jittery; like an ADHD kid who REALLY needed her medication, so I was better off teaching because if I would have stayed home I would have been (literally) bouncing off the walls. Plus it was good to still be part of the 'real world' and not just sit home thinking about what was happening to me 24-7. There is really no way to know ahead of time how you will react because everyone is so different; but if you love your job and want to work, it is very possible that you will be able to keep at it, either full or part time. I see this is your 3rd post. You may know you only get 5 posts every day until you reach 50 posts, but can send as many private messages as you want. So, PM me if there are any questions I can help you with. Best of Luck! Ruth",

This two-step approach reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence (the cancer coming back). But in 2004, this treatment approach changed for older women. Large studies showed that while lumpectomy plus radiation did reduce the rate of recurrence among older women, it didn\u2019t improve their overall survival. Overall survival is the amount of time the women lived, with or without the cancer coming back. So the National Comprehensive Cancer Network modified its treatment guidelines: radiation therapy became optional for women aged 70 and older diagnosed with early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer who take hormonal therapy for 5 years or more after lumpectomy. Doctors then wondered if women who were younger than 70 but still postmenopausal also might be able to skip radiation after lumpectomy. A small study suggests that women aged 55 to 75 diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer treated with only lumpectomy have the same recurrence rates as women treated with lumpectomy and radiation. The study, \u201cBreast conservation surgery with and without radiotherapy in patients aged 55-75 with early stage breast cancer: A prospective randomized multi-centre trial analysis after 90 months of medium follow-up,\u201d was presented at the 2013 American Society of Breast Surgeons Annual Meeting. Researchers looked at 749 women aged 55 to 75 who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer at 11 medical centers in Italy. The women were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: The researchers followed the women for about 9 years. There was no difference in recurrence rates between the two treatment groups. There was also no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival (the time the women lived without the cancer coming back). While these results are promising, other research has shown that some older women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer get benefits from radiation after lumpectomy. More research needs to be done before doctors know for sure which older women can safely skip radiation therapy after lumpectomy to remove early-stage breast cancer. If you\u2019re a postmenopausal woman and have been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, you and your doctor will consider the characteristics of the cancer, your unique situation, your surgical options, your treatment options after surgery, and your personal preferences when creating your treatment plan. If you\u2019ll be having lumpectomy, talk to your doctor about why radiation therapy is or isn\u2019t recommended for you after surgery and how that decision was made.",

Also, a mastectomy is a major surgery with huge potential negative SEs of its own, as is the reconstruction process. Some people have no choice but to have a mastectomy, others feel in their heart that it is the right choice for them. But if you have doubts, then I would definitely go with the lumpectomy. ",

Hope it helps: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\" ",

      "Content": "Jan 9, 2016 12:35AM - edited Jan 9, 2016 12:37AM by ruthbru This is on the Breaking News section of the BCO homepage, it just came out in December and is from the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium: Many studies done in the 1970s showed that lumpectomy plus radiation to treat women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer offered the same survival rates as mastectomy. Based on these studies, the U.S. National Institutes of Health released a statement in 1990 saying that lumpectomy plus radiation was preferred over mastectomy to treat early-stage breast cancer. Over the last several years, some studies suggested that lumpectomy plus radiation offered better survival than mastectomy for women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, but the follow-up time for these studies was only 5 years. A Dutch study with 10 years of follow-up also suggests that lumpectomy plus radiation may offer survival benefits for some women diagnosed with early-stage disease. The study, \"Higher 10-year overall survival after breast conserving therapy compared to mastectomy in early-stage breast cancer: A population-based study with 37,207 patients,\" (Abstract S3-05) was presented on Dec. 10, 2015 at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. In this study, only the women who had lumpectomy had radiation. In some cases, radiation may be given after mastectomy, especially if the tissue removed during mastectomy doesn't have clear margins or if the cancer is more than one spot in the breast. Overall, the women who had lumpectomy were younger and had more favorable cancer characteristics. Both of these factors would make it more likely that these women would have better survival compared to older women who had less favorable cancer characteristics. After 10 years, overall survival rates were: Overall survival is how long the women lived, whether or not the cancer came back. The researchers did a second analysis that accounted for differences in factors that might affect overall survival, such as: The adjusted analysis also found that women who had lumpectomy plus radiation had higher overall survival rates. The researchers found that disease-free survival was similar between the two groups. Disease-free survival is how long the women lived without the cancer coming back. The researchers suspect that the radiation was the reason for the difference in overall survival. \"We think that radiation therapy may have played an important role in the difference in the outcomes from both treatments, although we cannot prove it with our data,\" said Sabina Siesling, Ph.D., senior researcher at the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation. This study was a population-based study, which means the researchers used information that was collected before the study was planned. It also means that the women weren't randomly assigned to get lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy. So the women may have had other health problems that might have affected the type of surgery they had. These other health conditions also may have affected their survival. Population-based studies aren't considered as good as randomized clinical studies. The study also didn't look at: All of the above factors can affect the lumpectomy vs. mastectomy decision-making process. \"Our study is not an absolute,\" said Dr. Siesling. \"We need to look at each woman's individual situation and tailor the treatment to her. I want to stress that patients need to be given all the information available. The results of this study are part of that information.\" \"I don't think this study would change the current recommendations at this time,\" said Carlos L. Arteaga, M.D., director of the Breast Cancer Program at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center and co-director of the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. If you've been diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer, you and your doctor will talk about a surgical approach that makes the most sense for you and your unique situation. You will take into account a number of factors, including: Whichever surgery you choose -- lumpectomy plus radiation or mastectomy with or without radiation -- know that much research has shown that both are equally effective in removing early-stage breast cancer and reducing the risk of it coming back.

First, I think that whether or not you are prone to LE has mostly to do with how your lymph system handles trauma. I would say most cases (unless you are in a horrible accident or are doing really extreme activities) are neither through any virtue or fault of your own; just a matter of good or bad 'luck'.

If you get a good, custom wig they will fit like hair, and be more light weight and comfortable than if you order one from someplace. This shop had a nice assortment of scarves, turbans, hats (some with bangs so it looked like you had hair). Everyone feels differently about the wig/no wig thing, but it was really important to me physiologically to look just plain normal when I was out and about.....I didn't have the energy to deal with people asking questions or feeling sorry for me.",

Some tips I can think of for chemo are: * get some Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash (I believe they have a soothing gel too), that is what my dentist recommended and it really worked for me....I liked the mouthwash so much that I still use it. * Dove soap is the most gentle soap.....I liked it so much that I still use it too * keep your fingernails AND your toenails polished...seems to help with nail issues * This is what my hairdresser told me to do & my hair came back really nice. Buy Nioxin shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment for chemically treated hair (because your hair is being chemically treated from the inside out). Start using it now and use it throughout treatment; even when you don't have hair, wash your scalp as often as you would if you did. Once you are done with chemo use Nioxin for untreated hair until your hair comes back how you like it, then you can switch back to your regular shampoo. * drink tons of water before, during and after your AC infusions * if you can keep moving, go for walks...whatever; I think that help with bone pain, other aches and makes you feel better mentally too * I took a prescription sleeping pill during treatment because I absolutely could not sleep otherwise....it really was a lifesaver for me.....  ",

I didn't have any trouble with radiation, just got red & hot at the end (like a sunburn from the inside out).....use whatever lotion they recommend religiously (some people with mastectomies end up with radiation as well). If you are estrogen positive, anti-hormonals will be recommended no matter what kind of surgery you choose.",

They are very cautious and precise, so she should not have any damage to her heart no matter what her age. A mastectomy is, of course, a more serious and harder to recover from surgery, with more possibilities of complications. At 80, I, personally would be more worried about that than radiation.",

So the purpose is simply to help  women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term.  Before getting to that list, here is some research that  compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach.  If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research  has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the  breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast  cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of  surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't  affect survival rates.  Here are a few studies that compare the  different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast  Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How  someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had  might be very different than how you will feel about it and the  experience that you will have.  So try to figure out what's best for  you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most  easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options.  Good  luck with your decision!\"  ",

Something that helped me so much is that my co-workers brought us meals a couple times a week when I was on chemo. Not to have to worry about food at all was such a load off my mind (and because they always brought so much that there was enough for a couple days of leftovers). I second Jane's recommendation to take the anti-nausea drugs exactly as prescribed. That is not an area to 'wait and see how things go.\" The other thing that will sound strange, if you can stand to get a little exercise throughout, that will actually make you feel better and help manage fatigue. After chemo, rads for me were easy, I could feel my energy returning every day....so, like everything else, it is really an individual thing.",

Here is her impartial and very thorough list of things to consider as you make your decisions: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\"",

Last summer I was visiting a friend, and she brought me to these gardens. Many years before there was a very rich couple by the name of Clemens who lived in her town, and who loved to garden. After the wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and confined to a wheelchair, her husband bought the land across the street from their house, land which overlooks the river, and made it into a very large and very beautiful garden for his wife. They could wheel over and enjoy the flowers or look at them out of the front window. After her death, her husband gave the gardens to the city as a memorial to his wife, and for the perpetual enjoyment of all. ",

On this golden land, they wait and they play, Till the Rainbow Bridge they cross over one day. No more do they suffer, in pain or in sadness, For here they are whole, their lives filled with gladness. Their limbs are restored, their health renewed, Their bodies have healed, with strength imbued. They romp through the grass, without even a care, Until one day they start, and sniff at the air. All ears prick forward, eyes dart front and back, Then all of a sudden, one breaks from the pack. For just at that instant, their eyes have met; Together again, both person and pet. So they run to each other, these friends from long past, The time of their parting is over at last. The sadness they felt while they were apart, Has turned into joy once more in each heart. They embrace with a love that will last forever, And then, side-by-side, they cross over\u2026 together.",

From personal experience and talking to many others, I think you need to double that amount of time. Not that you will feel lousy for two more years, but it will be a very gradual movement back to feeling pretty normal. It kind of sneaked up on me; I remember at the end of one day being suprised to notice that I had actually felt GOOD! One of the things you can do that will really help the process along is to make a commitment to exercise (at whatever level you are able). Exercise IS the magic bullet, in my opinion. It makes you feel better both physically and mentally, plus lowers your chances of recurrence. Best of luck!",

Most people actually gain weight during chemo, not lose. I think it's because people are usually less active and more likely to be eating comfort food and/or have friends who are bringing them over big meals. I didn't gain or lose....mostly because chocolate tasted like CHALK, so there went my favorite comfort food right off the bat! (It tastes fine again now, thank goodness!)",

I went to a place that specialized in wigs and got a wonderful lightweight sythenic wig, which they styled just how I waited. It was a brand called Amy's Choice; I could swim in if I wanted to, sleep in if I wanted to. It was developed by a soap opera star named Amy. I can't remember her last name or show, but she has alopecia and has to wear a wig all the time forever and couldn't find anything she thought was very comfortable or suited for real life situations (like swimming etc.), so started her own line. This was 10 years ago so I don't know if they are available or not anymore.They are spendy, and at the time anyway, Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Dakota didn't recognize hair as a body part, so wouldn't pay for a wig even with a prescription (which I fought to no avail all the way to the State Insurance Commissioner ). So I paid for it myself because it was important to me to look \"normal\", mostly because I didn't want people to treat me differently or even know what was going on unless I wanted them to.

When she was diagnosed, you didn't have a choice...you had a mastectomy. Later, when it was widely available, she had reconstruction. So, she has seen BC from both sides of the operating table. When I asked for her opinion, she said (without skipping a beat), \"If you have the choice of a lumpectomy, TAKE IT.\" You are in the worst part now. Once you get a treatment plan in place, then you just do it...and come out on the other side. Best of luck!",

Not that you don't feel better & better the further you get away from it, but I found it took a long time to get all the way back (I had chemo, rads & took Arimidex (which I had nor problems with), but no Herceptin or reconstruction, which I imagine would set you back too).

My thought was that if I wasn't happy, I could do a mastectomy later but once my breast was gone, it was gone forever. As time has gone on, I am even more glad that I made that choice. This is just me, but I would have had a hard time being flat, but the more I have learned about the problems with reconstruction, the less I think that I could ever go through that process (and it is a process, not a one shot and you're done type of thing). Here is another post beesie did later with her thoughts on her reconstruction experience: \"What I've learned from having my MX is that a MX affects you for your lifetime. I'm more than 7 years out and there are days when the affect of my MX and reconstruction is still very noticeable to me - muscle aches, sore ribs, etc.. There are activities that I no longer do, or try to avoid, because of the reconstruction. How I felt about my MX and reconstruction when I first had my surgery (elated!), how I felt about it two years later (surprisingly disappointed), 5 years later (it is what it is) and now 7 years later (occasionally frustrated) has continued to change and evolve. I think that's important to understand because so much of what you read on this board is from people who have just completed the process, or who are still in the middle of the process. Whether they feel good about it or bad about it at this point in time could easily change as time goes on.\"",

It gives a good, non-judgmental look at treatment options: \"Some time ago I put together a list of considerations for someone who was making the surgical choice between a lumpectomy, mastectomy and bilateral mastectomy. I've posted this many times now and have continued to refine it and add to it, thanks to great input from many others. Some women have gone through the list and decided to have a lumpectomy, others have chosen a single mastectomy and others have opted for a bilateral mastectomy. So the purpose is simply to help women figure out what's right for them - both in the short term but more importantly, over the long term. Before getting to that list, here is some research that compares long-term recurrence and survival results. I'm including this because sometimes women choose to have a MX because they believe that it's a more aggressive approach. If that's a big part of someone's rationale for having an MX or BMX, it's important to look at the research to see if it's really true. What the research has consistently shown is that long-term survival is the same regardless of the type of surgery one has. This is largely because it's not the breast cancer in the breast that affects survival, but it's the breast cancer that's left the breast that is the concern. The risk is that some BC might have moved beyond the breast prior to surgery. So the type of surgery one has, whether it's a lumpectomy or a MX or a BMX, doesn't affect survival rates. Here are a few studies that compare the different surgical approaches: Lumpectomy May Have Better Survival Than Mastectomy Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Trial Comparing Total Mastectomy, Lumpectomy, and Lumpectomy plus Irradiation for the Treatment of Invasive Breast Cancer Twenty-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Study Comparing Breast-Conserving Surgery with Radical Mastectomy for Early Breast Cancer Now, on to my list of the considerations: .I hope that this helps. And remember.... this is your decision. How someone else feels about it and the experience that someone else had might be very different than how you will feel about it and the experience that you will have. So try to figure out what's best for you, or at least, the option that you think you can live with most easily, given all the risks associated with all of the options. Good luck with your decision!\"",

Here are some of my thoughts on getting through it (some of which have already been advised. 1. get your teeth cleaned before you start so you don't have to worry about dental issues during treatment. Use the Biotene toothpaste & mouthwash. 2. Dove soap is the mildest for the skin and moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! (For some reason the only lotions that smelled good to me had a coconut scent). 3. You will for sure lose your hair, probably two weeks after the first round; so decide ahead of time what you want to do. If you want a wig, get one ordered & in place, if you want to wear hats/scarves etc. get some ready to go. 4. Attend an American Cancer Society 'Look Good, Feel Better' event. They are wonderful. They give you advice on the best way to wear wigs, scarves etc. and makeup tips to help you look your best during chemo plus several hundred dollars worth of really good brand name makeup. 5. Drink the water, especially before & during infusions as the 'C' is hard on the kidneys and you want to keep it moving along. 6. Take all the anti-nausea medication exactly as directed. You don't want to wait until you feel like crap. If it isn't working, tell them and they can try something else. 7.Get a number from your clinic you can call in case you have problems and don't hestiate to call with any questions or concerns. 8. If you can exercise at all (even if it is just walking around and around your house, it really will help). 9. I had my infusions on Friday and was back to work on Monday. The first three days I felt crummy, like I had the flu (but never threw up or anything) and pretty hyper (steriods)....then I would feel better & better until the next time. The weekend after treatment I lay pretty low but the weekends in-between I felt good enough to do whatever I wanted, which included taking a 350 mile trip to my niece's graduation before my last round. 10. I did ask for and take a prescription sleeping pill. Otherwise I would have been in trouble because I could not sleep at all. 11. If friends ask if there is anything they can do, say YES and then tell them exactly what they can do. I still had a child at home and the people at my work brought suppers twice a week, which was so wonderful. If you need food, or rides, or errands run....whatever, let people know. Many people would like to help but don't know what to do. 12. I also visualized; but, being a Lord of the Rings fan, I visualized the cancer cells as being the evil Orcs & the chemo agents were the heros (who had to be relentless as they fought the forces of evil). If you can think of the chemo as working FOR YOU, it helps with the BLUCKINESS of it all.  Best of Luck! Ruth",

Felt queasy like I had the flu....worse the first week, gradually improving & felt pretty good by the end of second week. Also felt very jumpy, a kind of 'climbing the wall' feeling, maybe from the steroids Did you have a port?  Yes; even though I was really uncomfortable with it, I am glad I had one to protect the integrity of my 'good' arm, as that is the arm I need to use for shots, blood work, blood pressure readings etc. for the rest of my life. Worth the creepiness of it for a couple months. Did you wear a wig? Yes, my 'hair' never looked better. I felt like I needed to look 'normal' for my job, and also I didn't want people to know that I was sick unless I felt like telling them about it. I also had 2 wigs; 'hair and a spare' What were the most challenging aspects of this  process? I wanted to keep working, I wanted to keep exercising, I wanted to do the things I ususally do, and I still had a teenager at home whose life I didn't want to disrupt more than it had to be....so just 'keeping on keeping on' was a challenge. What was unexpected? How other people reacted. Some people really came through and some people couldn't handle it at all.....and they were not always the people I would have expected. In what ways were you pleasantly  surprised? That I was stronger than I ever thought I could be, and how much I could help other people because of this experience, and the great friendships I've made with other BC ladies....friendships I would never had had otherwise What should we expect afterward? That life will be great! I really appreciate the little things. I've done more of the big things that one puts off until 'later', I'm more willing to take risks, and I don't sweat the little things as much (although that is still a work in progress). How long did it take before  you could actually style your hair? After I was done with chemo, it was still 6 months before I could ditch the wig Did any of you work through chemo? Yes, I did. I would do chemo on Friday so I could have the weekend to recover. Could not have traveled that weekend, but felt good enough on the weekend before my last treatment to attend my niece's graduation 350 miles away.",

Hope it helps: DOES MY RISK FOR LYMPHEDEMA DIMINISH OVER TIME? You have a lifelong risk for development of lymphedema anytime there is damage to the lymphatics (i.e. surgery, radiation, or trauma). That said, the longer you go after you have damage to your lymphatics without symptoms, there is possibly less risk you will ever develop symptoms. Nonetheless, there is always some level of risk if you have damaged lymphatics. For instance, radiation therapy induced lymphedema often shows up 1-2 years after treatment, but can manifest even 10 years after therapy is completed. It's important for you to remember that you always have some risk and occasionally patients will develop symptoms many years after the damage occurs. Because of this, it is a good idea to be diligent, know the signs and symptoms of lymphedema, and try to live by the healthy habits that may help you reduce your risk. As always, you should speak with your CLT about specific recommendations for you. You might also want to review these helpful guides. Many of them are common sense approaches to living not only a healthy life, but to helping reduce your risk of lymphedema. Maintain a healthy lifestyle: Eating a healthy balanced diet and exercising can help you keep a normal body weight, which can also significantly lower your risk of lymphedema. Exercise: Before beginning an exercise routine, check with your medical professional or CLT. It's useful to gradually build up the time and intensity of your workouts to see how your body reacts. Keep an eye out: You'll also want to monitor the at-risk area to see if there is any abnormal swelling, change in sensation, shape of the limb, soreness or heaviness. Create a good skin care routine: Keep your skin clean, dry, and well cared for. Make sure to apply moisturizer to keep your skin from cracking, and wear sunscreen and bug spray when you're outdoors. Know the signs of infections: Infections are dangerous for anyone, but especially for those as risk of lymphedema. Make sure to clean all cuts, scrapes, and insect bites when they happen and keep an eye on them. It's a great idea to keep a small first aid kit with you when you travel or are outdoors. Protect your at-risk limb: Try to avoid injury to that area such as cuts, scrapes, or even needle sticks. If possible, ask your medical professionals to do blood draws or vaccines on the limb that is not at risk. Avoid tight fitting objects on your at-risk limb: Try not to wear tight fitting clothes, rings, jewelry, or carry a heavy bag or purse on the at-risk side. This also goes for avoiding blood pressure cuffs on the at-risk side if possible.",

Just for my own self (and me only); I would never, ever have chemo at the age of 88, nor (if asked my opinion) would I advice a loved one to have it either (but I also won't want tests for other potential problems at that age, so my idea of 'don't ask, don't tell' might be kind of 'fringy').

The Oncotype DX analyzes the activity of a group of genes that can affect how a cancer is likely to behave and respond to treatment. The Oncotype DX is used to help doctors figure out a woman\u2019s risk of early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer coming back (recurrence), as well as how likely she is to benefit from chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery You may be a candidate for the Oncotype DX test if you\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with stage I or II invasive breast cancer, the cancer is estrogen-receptor-positive, there is no cancer in your lymph nodes (lymph node-negative breast cancer), and you and your doctor are making decisions about chemotherapy. Most early-stage (stage I or II), estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancers that haven\u2019t spread to the lymph nodes are considered to be at low risk for recurrence. After surgery, hormonal therapies such as an aromatase inhibitor or tamoxifen are prescribed to reduce the risk that the cancer will come back in the future. Whether or not chemotherapy is also necessary has been an area of uncertainty for patients and their doctors. If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, the Oncotype DX test can help you and your doctor make a more informed decision about whether or not you need chemotherapy. (Some research also suggests the test may help postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes make chemotherapy decisions.)",

I wore a wig (which looked very, very cute). I went to a salon that specialized in that sort of thing before I started chemo and they helped me pick one out that would match my color/style etc. that way it was ready when I needed it. Two weeks after my first chemo, just like they said, it started to shed. I went in, had them buzz my hair, and came out wearing the wig. Even my husband couldn't tell the difference. What you do about 'hair' is really a personal preference. I know other people who wore caps, turbans, or went commando and were very comfortable with their decisions too. (That route was not for me, because without hair I looked like an escaped convict! )",

Second, there are complimentary things; like acupuncture, meditation, massage etc. that help many people. Third, getting some light exercise can actually help you physically (and for sure, mentally).

(Or if the study I cited is right, having a lumpectomy plus rads, may actually decrease recurrence risk more than a mastectomy without rads.) There are many reasons why one might choose a mastectomy, as many of the ladies above have articulated, but I have to say that I was thrilled to have the lumpectomy choice, and have never regretted going that route because:  * a mastectomy is a more major surgery; with more possible complications, longer recovery time, more expense, time lost from work etc. etc. I hate doctors, hospitals, drains, surgery...anything medical, plus I had things to do and didn't want to give up that much time to 'cancer'. * a mastecomy either means you will need to learn to live breast-free, which is a difficult adjustment for many, or you will have to undergo more hassle, expense, pain, recovery time, possible side effects etc. etc. doing of reconstruction....which does not guarantee good or lasting results....again, I hate medical stuff; and particularly after learning about all the reconstruction horror stories (even the successful ones make me feel faint); I am pretty sure I couldn't do it. Which means I would have to be flat, which would make me feel sad, or deal with a prosthesis, which would be a pain in the butt. I am glad to still have my breast, and if down the road I would have a local recurrence & have to have a mastectomy, well, I would still be glad I made my original choice because I will have had many extra years without all that hassle/pain/money/time..... * when I was making my decision, I asked a friend who is a 35 year BC surivor and a surgical nurse. When she was diagnosed, you didn't have a choice...you had a mastectomy. Later, when it was widely available, she had reconstruction. So, she has seen BC from both sides of the operating table. When I asked for her opinion, she said (without skipping a beat), \"If you have the choice of a lumpectomy, TAKE IT.\" ",

The author is a leukemia survivor: The Things I Wish I Were Told When I Was Diagnosed With Cancer by Jeff Tomszek Your relationships are about to change. All of them. Some will get stronger. They will probably not be with the people you would expect. The people you want to handle this well might not be able to for a variety of reasons. Some of the reasons will be selfish. Some of them will be entirely innocent and circumstantial. All of them will be forgivable because no one plans for cancer. Carrying bitterness or anger won't help your recovery. Fighting for anyone to stick with you won't cure you. Those who can, will.  You will be determined to have more energy than you do. You will convince yourself that you are thinking straight, are able to handle all of this and do not need anyone. You will run out fuel. Your body will change first and your mind will follow. You won't lose your mind, memories or sensibility. It will all come back. But, you will be different. You will never have the same sense of self. You should embrace this. Your old self was probably really great. Your transformed self will be even better. Give into what is happening and trust it.  You are going to feel fear. Even if you are normally stubborn, confident and seemingly invincible you will finally find yourself admitting that you are scared of something. Cancer is scary and incredibly confusing. The unknowing will eat at you worse than the disease itself. You'll need distractions. Music and sleep will probably be the ones you resort to most. Reading will become difficult. So will watching TV or movies, having conversations, writing and basically everything else. They call it \"chemo brain\" for a reason. You will feel normal eventually. Just a new kind of normal. When you feel afraid let yourself lean on those around you. Cry. Be vulnerable. You are vulnerable. There will be time for strength, but never admitting weakness will cause anxiety to mount and your condition to worsen. Let it all out. Yell if you need to. Sing when you feel up to it. Sob uncontrollably. Apologize for your mood swings. Treatments and prescriptions will often be the cause of them. The people that love you will understand.  The people that love you will be just as scared as you are. Probably more. They will be worrying even when they are smiling. They will assume you are in more pain than you are. They will be thinking about you dying and preparing for life without you. They will go through a process that you will never understand just like they will never understand the process you are going through. Let them process. Forgive them when they don't understand. Exercise patience when you can. Know that those that were built for this will be there when you get to the other side and you will all be able to laugh together again. You'll cry together too. Then you'll get to a place where you will just live in the world again together and that is when you know that you have beaten this.  The sooner you recognize that you are mortal, the sooner you can create the mentality for survival. There is a chance you might not make it. Just like there is a chance that you will. Don't look at statistics. You are unique and what is happening inside you is unique. Your fight is yours alone and there are too many factors to compare yourself to others that have had your condition. No one will want you to think about death, but you won't have a choice. You will think about it from the moment you are given your diagnosis. Come to terms with it. Calmly accept it. Then, shift every thought you have into believing that you won't die. You are going to beat this. Your mental focus on that fact will be more powerful than any treatment you receive.  Your doctors and nurses will become your source of comfort. You will feel safe with them. If you do not feel safe with them you need to change your care provider immediately. There is no time to waste. This shouldn't be a game played on anyone's terms but yours. When you find the right caretakers you will know immediately. Do not let insurance, money or red tape prevent you from getting the treatment you deserve. This is your only shot. There is always a way. Find those hands that you trust your life in and willingly give it to them. They will quickly bring you a sense of calm. They will spend time answering your questions. There will be no stupid questions to them. They won't do anything besides make you feel like you are the most important life that exists. They will never make you feel like they don't have things in control. They will be honest and accessible at all times. They might even become your friends. You might celebrate with them over drinks months or years after they have cured you. They deserve your gratitude, respect and appreciation daily. If you get upset at them during treatment know that they'll forgive you. They get that you're going through something they can't imagine- but they understand better than anyone. They see it every day and they choose to be there because they want to make the worst experience of your life more tolerable.  You will need to find balance after treatment. Start by seeking balance during treatment. Eat well. Sleep well. Listen to your body. Explore meditation. Experiment with new forms of exercise that aren't so demanding. Embrace massage and other body therapies. Go to therapy. A therapist will be able to guide you through your journey in ways you could never fathom. Do not be too proud to speak to someone. You cannot afford to store up the intensity of the emotion that comes with fighting a life-threatening illness. Let it out for yourself. You will begin to hear your voice changing. That voice is who you are becoming in the face of mortality. Listen to that voice. It will be the purest, most authentic version of you that you have ever known. Bring that person into the world -- strengths and vulnerabilities and everything between. Be that person forever.  You will inspire others. It will feel weird. People you haven't spoken to since grade school will be in touch. Ex-girlfriends, former colleagues... even people you felt never wanted to talk to you again. The influx of interest in your seemingly fading life will be greater than any living moment you have ever experienced. That support is what will shift a fading life into a surviving one. Be grateful for every message. Be appreciative of each gift and each visit. There will be moments where all of this attention will make you feel lonelier than you have ever felt in your life. In a hospital room full of people with messages stuffing your inbox, voicemail and mailbox you will find yourself feeling completely alone. This is when you will realize that you could afford to have a stronger relationship with yourself. That only you walk this earth with 100% investment in you. Make the investment and use this as an opportunity to reexamine your self-worth. Love yourself more than ever and recognize how much love there is for you in the world. Then start sharing that love. You will come to see that even when you are the neediest person you know you can still be giving. Giving will make you feel better than taking. When you get to the other side you won't believe it. They will tell you the disease is gone. Everyone you know will rejoice and return back to their lives. You'll constantly wonder if it is coming back. Slowly this feeling will fade, but cancer will always be a part of you. It will define how you see the world moving forward. You're going to feel like the future is a funny thing to think about because the present is going to suddenly seem incredibly important. Keep moving. You'll be more productive. You'll understand who truly loves you because they will still be there. You'll want to meet new people that connect to the newly evolved version of your old self. You'll want to let go of those that don't \"get\" who you are now. You'll feel a little guilty doing it. Then, you'll move on. You don't have time to waste. The greatest gift you've been given is that you now understand that and you're going to make the most of every second. You're going to be the most passionate person you know going forward. Translate that passion to a greater purpose. Be fearless again.   ",

I did rads; and with that big of a tumor, you should too. They were not at all a problem for me. Add the conventional and natural together and you will give yourself the best chance of being OK at the end. Best of luck! Ruth",

I don't have any doctors to recommend, but make sure both she and you make that point clear to any medical personnel that you deal with. Now these are just my own opinions, not medical advice; but since you know there is a problem, I think she should have the biopsy to see what is going on. If it is benign, I would be glad and then never have another mammogram again! If it is cancer, then I would have a lumpectomy to get rid of the tumor (an easier operation to go through and recover from than a mastectomy), and that might be all I would do. I might consider radiation, and I might consider an anti-hormonal if she is estrogen positive, but I would never, ever do chemo as a 90 year old or want any of my loved ones to go through it either at that age (and I am not anti-chemo by any means, it's just at that point I don't know how you could ever recover enough to regain any good quality of life....chemo is tough stuff, I, for sure, would never do it again if I was over the age of 75).

(as someone pointed out, you wouldn't have been posting if you had felt comfortable with the 'no chemo' suggestion).  As others have said, chemo isn't fun, but it is very doable. The only work I missed was on infusion days (did it on Fridays, was back to work Mondays). Went to track meets, band concerts, church, my niece's graduation, (which was 500 miles away), anything that I wanted/needed to do. Did I feel 'normal'? No, not at all. Could I carry on? Yes, I could. And you will too. Best of Luck! Ruth",

No, you do not have to stay inside at all, in fact the more 'normal' things you can do the better. Are you going to get Neulasta shots? If you are, then you really don't have to worry that much about infections as the shots kick your white blood cells into production. 2. Can I go to work? Most likely, yes. Everyone reacts differently, of course, so you will have to see how it goes and adjust accordingly. I teach, and only missed infusion days (Fridays). Also went to a 500 mile away family weekend for a graduatuion between my 3rd & 4th round. 3. Can I do cooking, cleaning, and other similar things? Yes, but here is where I'd ask for help. My co-workers organized a calendar & brought us meals a couple days a week...which was wonderful as things smelled & tasted icky to me, so cooking would have been hard. Also hire a cleaning lady, or enlist friends/family to help out....and relax your standards. This is one time fast foo, paper plates and a little dust are all OK. 4. Can I go to drop off my kids to school? Yes...but again, if that makes you tired, ask for volunteers to help you out. 5. Can I go for shopping and grocery? Yes....again, if that makes you tired, get someone else to do it. Save your energy for the important things (like doing things with your kids). 6. Is there any other thing which I should do or avoid during chemo? If you haven't already done so, go to a 'Look Good, Feel Better' class (sponsered by the American Cancer Society). Gives you great tips on make up, wigs, head coverings etc. and samples of great makeup, all for free. If you are thinking of a wig, get that ordered ahead of time. 7. Can I attend my yoga classes? You should do whatever exercise you feel up to during chemo. It will help you get through it better & bounce back quicker once you are done. If you like yoga, keep going to yoga. If you find that isn't working for you, walking is great, and there are many exercise DVDs you can do at home (and kind of fake your way through if you feel crummy & don't want to go out). I felt like I had a mild case of the flu the whole time....didn't feel good, but was able to maintain a pretty regular schedule.....which was good for me mentally, anyway. Best of luck!",

I felt like I had a mild case of the flu the whole time; but felt good enough to go to work, do everything I had to do, and most of what I wanted to do too (including traveling out of state for a niece's graduation). So, my experience was not as bad as I anticipated. A hint would be to drink water like crazy before, during & after your infusion. You will probably feel worse the first 3 days after your treatment, so you might want to play around a little with the timing during the holidays. I, for instance, usually had my infusion on Friday; but when I went to that graduation, they let me wait and do it when I got back on Monday so that I wouldn't be feeling crummy for all the graduation festivities.

Two women could live exactly the same life style (be that a totally good or bad one); one will get cancer & the other one not. Genetics? Luck? Who knows. So, what to do? First, don't beat yourself up, just concentrate on getting through treatment. Once you are done (not now, because that will just add to the stress), then think about the areas of your life you'd like to tweak; not just for the risk of cancer recurrence, but for overall good health. If you are overweight, you will want to get down to and maintain a healthy weight. If you don't exercise, you will want to start. If you only eat processed junk food, you will want to eat more fruits, veggies, and natural food. If you love chocolate, switch to dark chocolate (which actually has health benefits!!!). If you drink a lot, cut back. If you smoke, stop. Common sense things that, of course, don't guarantee anything but will improve your quality of life no matter what. Best of luck!",

I would take Friday off for the infusion, lie low over the weekend, and be back to work Monday. Here a are couple things about it: * nobody knows how they will react to chemo, you might be like me and feel not good (but not terrible), but really antsy.....and working was good because I HAD to think about and deal with other things beside CANCER 24/7. Other people feel really rotten or really, really tired and it would be difficult if not impossible for them to work. So, if you want to work, go in with the attitude that you WILL, but be aware that you might have to adjust. * I did 4 rounds of AC dose dense, every two weeks with Neulasta shots. With the shots kicking my white blood cells into production, I didn't really have to worry about infections etc. without them, I think it would have been more difficult to be around kids and their colds etc. all the time. *Make sure your administrator knows what is going on & is supportive. I (with permission) had the secretary forward updates on my health situation on a periodic basis so I wouldn't have people asking me, or silently wondering how I was doing all the time. I also contacted my parents and let them know what was going on. * Get as much of the extra 'stuff' as you can done ahead of time. Run off papers, get lessons ready, get as many of your meetings and as much of your paperwork done as possible before you start. * You will be pretty wiped out by the end of the day. Take any and all offers for help. Hire a cleaning lady, if people offer to bring you food say YES, make your outside of school life as easy as possible. Those are some things I can think of off the top of my head. If you have any other concerns I can help you with, just let me know!",

Along with wonderful ladies on BCO, I've lost several really good friends to cancer, including a one who was diagnosed at the same time as me; same stats, same treatments, everything, we pretty much went through treatment together....but she had a recurrence 2 years later and has since then died. I think about her and the others a lot, and it makes me very sad because I know how very much they wanted to live and how badly they are missed. But it also makes me realize just how lucky I have been, and it makes me appreciate life even more. My take on it is: people should do whatever is medically recommended (and whatever lifestyle changes they need to make too), and after that you just have to leave the rest to God, fate, luck.....there is no need to feel guilty, it is out of your hands.",
