Rubbery and stuck to the tissue. About 1/2 cm. Left breast about where the wire bra is at. I have to wait for a week for US DM. Should I schedule a surgery now with a breast surgeon to remove it? I'm afraid it's BS cuz it's non movable. I'm a mom and healthy and don't have a family history so I'm truly scared. I don't take anxiety meds but I feel like I need to start now  ",
