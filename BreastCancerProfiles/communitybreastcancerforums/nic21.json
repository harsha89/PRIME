They seem to be relying on my age too much, when someone i went to school with had it at 18 and another girl had it at 20.... I wasnt mates with these just new them. I dont like the way people asume something due to this. Thing is my doctors have been like this with a few family members and myself on certain things. E.G he gave me blood pressure tablets for high blood pressure years ago i was like 19 and he ddint even check my blood pressure, he didnt do any tests. With my mother she had a serious ear infection last year, he never seen her just spoke over the phone and told her its just a cold, when this could of actualy made her deaf. She in the end went to A and E. Recently this doctors has a bad name, but i cant change. I dont know anything about breast cancer and afew women have told me it needs to be ruled out, the longer i leave it the less chance i have.... But then i think they are the doctors so maybe i should just go with what they tell me... xxx",

I am not too sure what i wrote in my last story so i will start from the beginning and i hope to ahve replies asap... Well I am now 22 years old and i have no children and generaly my health is ok. I do suffer with IBS and i used to have depression and i still have anxiety from time to time... In 2005 i was suffering with excessive sweating that didnt smell and it was on and off most the time and has been since. I was given Driclor to try which helped to a degree but i was finding it too strong so i stoped using it and within time, when the stress was less i found it decreased but has never really gone. In about July 2007 sometime i started having pain under my armpit, like an ache, so i checked it and i found a lump. To be honest i didnt think much of it and carried on as normal. The sweating started up again so i went to my doctor and he gave me Anhydrol forte and that helped the sweating alot. I shave every other day and i was told to cut that out abit as it was probably irriating it. Over the months it slowly was getting bigger and more painful and when i move my arm it aches too... I stopped wearing deodrant to see if that helped. Then i started to itch and as i scratched away it made my arm very swore, and by this stage i was still shaving and sometimes using Anhydrol forte. Time past and it started to bug me because the pain had spread into the side of my breast and to me it felt lumpy, so i went back to the doctor and he gave me some anti botics. They didnt help in anyway so i went back but my doctor was always off so i seen another doctor and he gave me 2 lots of anti botics, stronger ones, nothing changed, so i went and seen the nurse, she didnt have a clue and she gave me a blood test to check for infection and glandular fever. They both told me it was nothing to worry about because of my age and that they didnt no what was wrong. They looked in books, asked other Doctors and nursing, i ever seen another doctor and he gave me other anti botics. They could feel the lumps and at that moment the surface wasnt irriated, shortly after it was due to me shaving too close etc. (This was going on for a few months) No improvement just worsen if anything and becomeing uncomfortable. I rang my doctor again and he told me the blood tests are all clear, no infection and no diebetis and no glandular fever so he suggested anti botics and see how it goes. I left it few weeks and rang back and he referred me to a dermatologist... I wasnt too sure why i was sent to one. Anyway i finaly got my oppointment and she seemed to not have a clue. Told me to put metrogel on it and use alcohol gel on it and she said i may just have a bug in it, so i tried it and my armpit killed when i applied it and my skin went red and immflamed when before outside was fine, so i stopped using it all... I rang my doctor and said i wasnt happy and that earla that morning i had a letter saying i onyl seen a locom dermatologist and she wasnt wrongly doing her job and i needed to go asap for treatment. So on 15th jan 08 i went and he was a lovely bloke. He said the sweating i can sort with botox injections and to stop irriation dont shave for 4 weeks and dont use dedrant so close and told me that the women shouldnt of gave me what she did. He made me sit on the bed, checked my arms when i moved, poked underneath, had a good feel and he said that is a seperate problem and you should be seeing a different specialist but it isnt my place to say who, you need to go see the GP asap and get a referral and he said he was going to write a letter aswel. He made it clear that they were too different problems and when together is annoying. He asked what was more the problem and i said the pain and the lump. I told him my breast hurts more these days but the other one never hurts and that i dont understand it. When i feel it, it dont feel right and it kills after, just like after he felt my armpit i could hardly move it after because it ached so much. This is becoming annoying and why wont someone just help me like now instead of ages later... In general i feel exhusted all the time and i keep feeling extremly sick on and off and the last 2 weeks only i been getting alot of headaches... Any ideas please and what should i do???? I rang my doctor yesterday and guess what hes off again, i spoke to another one and he ANT GOT A CLUE!! Isnt there anything i can do without them!!? thankyou nic xxxxxxxxxxx Log in to post a reply",

The nipple is darker on that side and the nipple is turned in a little but the other one isnt. Is slightly puffy than the other one. I am only a 34 A anyways, so not huge. What do you mean by cords or tendons? No discharge, no rash nothing else i dont think. xxx",

Well for the past 3 years i have suffered with exsessive persperation that didnt smell and i was given Driclor which help wonders. Until about 6 months ago ish the same problem occur just more servere and as time past the right armpit started to itch and hurt, then i noticed a lump appear underneath my skin. As more time went on the pain got worse and the lump got bigger and my armpit always felt clamy, so i went to see my nurse. She and the doctor poked it and made me do different things to see how it looked and they wasnt too sure what it was, they said it could be an infection so they gave me some anti-botics, i think they were call flumoxillin (or something like that) i thought these wasnt doing the trick but i finished the course anywayz. I was also given Anhydrol Forte to help with the sweating and that does the trick, but i try not to use it often. I went back to the nurse and she said give it a few days and it should clear up, well its now 2 weeks later with still no improvement. The lump as got bigger and the pain as spread down my armpit onto the side of my breast and in my breast. My nipple hurts and has werid sensations in it, above the nipple hurts and around the whole breast, the side nearest my armpit. The whole area aches and feels heavy and can be really uncomfortable at times. My areaol is very darken to than it normaly is. I have tried to feel for lumps and i am not quite sure what i am looking for but i do think it feels different from the other breast. I have been given a test to see if i am diabetic cuz i have also been suffering with excessive urination and excessive thrist, i am feeling tired alot and not nesscerialy sleeping well and i do get hot flushes. Any ideas what this is or what i should do?? Thanks nic xxx Log in to post a reply",
