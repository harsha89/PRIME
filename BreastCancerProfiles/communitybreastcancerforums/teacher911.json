I know my onc is hoping that it would get me to NED.  I meet with the thoracic surgeon this week and my onc next week.  Any INFO would be helpful.

The scent always takes me back and makes me feel like she is right there with me. I like the idea of stories as well, and think I will try to work on those for my children.",
