I am a CRNA (nurse anesthetist) and have done the anesthesia for all of these types of procedures. With that being said, my disclaimer is I do not have breast cancer (I am in the waiting period and 6 month mammogram/US game) therefore these women can give you their opinion and experience. As for me, if I have to go this route I would have a general/breast surgeon excise the mass, lumpectomy and/or mastectomy. If you are talking mastectomy and immediate reconstruction or implant placement, I'm getting a plastic surgeon. I joke with my family about how I have a specific surgeon for any type of condition we may endure (and I have a list of who would not touch me lol) If you have some friends in the medical field (nurses in particular), they might know someone who works in the OR. We surgical people are a tight knit group and tend to know who we would go to if needed. Clearly search the web for the particular facility your are going to, do they have a Breast Clinic? Who are their practitioners? When you look at those practitioners. Google them. Do not be afraid to interview them! Best wishes, prayers, and hugs!",
