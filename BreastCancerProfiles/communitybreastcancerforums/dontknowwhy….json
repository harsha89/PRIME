Unfortunately, cancer can spread very quickly.  I know you must be in shock and I can completely understand the anger.  I'm still very angry.  Doctors, I've heard tales, typically don't believe that young women can get breast cancer...not sure where they hell they've been.  It seems that they put off checking into and by then, its progressed.  These doctors need to get to a breast cancer conference asap.  Again, I'm so sorry. You might want to find a support group to talk to or possibly, a therapist?  I'm searching for a support group in my area because while I've been trying to handle this all myself, I really need help.  Family and friends try to help, but for the most part, don't get it.  They either minimize it because they think that will make it go away or they go the other extreme and make you feel like cancer girl.  Neither are very helpful...at least for me.  There are lots of treatment options.  Do not lose HOPE.  To borrow a phrase from a wonderful woman, there is no expiration date stamped on your foot.  Live and fight this nasty beast with everything that you have. Another website that caters to young breast cancer survivors is youngsurvival.org.  Its a place for women in diagnosed in their 20s and 30s.  Just as here, there are lots of great and wise women to vent to and to ask for help. I'm sorry that you're here, but I'm glad that you found us.  If there is anything you want to talk about or vent about, please feel free to pm me or anyone else.  Everyone is very friendly and wants to help. (((hugs)))  Holly",

I agree with Carole that sometimes you need a break from the boards...as well as a break from any kind of breast cancer research.  We make our own statistics!!

(I sincerely hope).  Cause right now, I just want to lay down and take a nap....a loooooonnnnggg nap!!  Hope this helps some.  I'm sooo random right now. Anytime, you want to chat or anything, please feel free to pm me!!  Usually helps when someone else is going through something similar.  Best wishes!!!!   Holly",

I was diagnosed with brain mets in June 2010.  The mri showed lots of lesions in my brain so I had no other option than 14 treatments of WBR.  The follow up mri showed a slight improvement (not terribly thrilled with that) and a recent mri showed that the brain mets were stable (again, not terribly thrilled).  I'm currently on Abraxane for my lungs.  Honestly, there hasn't been too much talk about the brain mets since.  I went to MD Anderson for a follow up opinion and they found two spots on my spinal cord, which was 10 radiation treatments.  I'm going back for follow at the end of November.  Hopefully, I'll have more information then.   I'm happy for your daughter that her hair is growing back from WBR...mine isn't growing. :-( \"Bump\" is when a topic is moved to the top so that it can be read by those that haven't had a chance to see it. I wish you both the best!! Holly",
