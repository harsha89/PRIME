If you don't get it checked out right away, and for some reason you develop anymore symptoms, please go get it checked out. The reason I checked mine out was because my right breast started changing in many ways. Other women only have 1 symptom. so please don't wait to long. It's better to be safe than sorry. Good luck and god bless........Leisa",

Is suppose to help with the draining. That's what it sayes in the paperwork they gave me anyway. Question...for anyone who has already had surgery. Did any of you get bandaged up afterwards or did they just leave you open with no bandages? They left me open with no bandages. Was wondering how common this was. Any replies would be appreciated. Also since they took all the nodes out of the right, can't have anything stuck in or on right side anymore. So they put the IV in the left. However they couldn't put it in the elbow crease or the back of my hand so they used my wrist. I had 3 fingers go numb the whole time the IV was in. They said it had nothing to do with the IV, BUT when they took the IV out all 3 fingers got the feeling back in them. So if this happens to any of you just know the feeling will come back after they take out the IV. Good Luck to all you going in this week. As soon as it's over you'll feel so much better.",

He said it was left over tissue. I asked when it would go away and he said it wouldn't. So damb it, it sounds like I'm gonna have to live with it. Hoping it will at least go down a little bit cuz right now it's a big pain in the ass. Feels like my arm is getting bruised just cuz it's hitting against the bump all the time. Saw the radiologist today. Got all marked up, next week getting tattooed. Will start radiation on Tuesday next week. At least I'll get to get a couple weeks out of the way before I have to go back to work. I was really hoping to have most of it done, but no such luck. Anyway, guess that's just how things go. Good luck all. Hugs to everyone.  Leisa",

Extra pillows for bed..to sit up. Open in front larger shirts. I also got a camasole, but where the elastic hits, landed right on the drain sights. That hurt. Took that off and went to the bigger shirt. feels a lot better. Slick P.J.'s to ease in and out of bed. Hope everyone having surgery this month has an easy time of it. Good Luck to all. Leisa",

I recieved all the above plus @ 10 more. Most are to be done at least 10 repetitions/ 3 times a day. Some you have to have a stick to do. Most want you to use the bad arm(as the pushing/pulling arm) to get it back into shape. The one I feel the most tension from is the arm swing. You bend over with good arm resting on a table, with the bad arm pointed toward the floor, swing the arm clock-wise (10 times)then counter-clock-wise(10 times). Reaching for the floor. I also have the wall slide, shoulder roll, arm curl, plus a few more. The therapist also showed me a thing to do to my sides to keep the lymph fluid flowing. I had all the ones on the right removed, she said this was something I would have to do the rest of my life. It's really simple, you just start at your hips, palms in, place on hips and push down and out. You then move up your sides all the way to your arm pits ( I have to use the back of my hands when I get close to the top...cuz I'm fat). After that, you put your hands at the top(arm pits) and push all the way down to the hips in one motion. Like I said it's suppose to help keep the lymph fluid moving. Since it's very simple, I will be doing it. Sure don't want anything clogging up the fluid. Sure don't want lymphodema. Hope this helps. Good luck all.  Leisa",

I remember the dr. doing something to it when he took the left one out so I tried it. It helped, I had a clog. Then I read some more of my paperwork. It's called milking the tube. You hold the tube at the top with one hand and pull on it with the other. It stretches the tube allowing the clog to pass. You do this all the way down to the bulb part of the tube. Then within a little bit the clog was in the bottom of the bulb. What a relief. I just wish they would have said something to me either when I got out of the hospital or at least when he removed the left one to remind me. Since then no leaks. Thank goodness. Have a good evening everyone.",

Have pretty good range of motion, but not all the way there yet. Surgeon wants to wait 3-6 weeks before starting radiation to give me more time to heal. Still don't have the pathology report back yet. Should have it by Friday when I get my first treatment of my year of  Herceptin. Hoping for clear results. I was able to get on normal clothes a bit larger a week after by doing the excercises. Just had to put the right side in first then the head then the other arm. Hope everyone is doing well. Good luck to those going in. For the rest of us who have already had surgery onto healing. Good Luck everyone. Sending blessings to you all.",

It's to keep the radiation to the top of the skin. Gave me 3rd degree burns everywhere the radiation went. Can only use sylvadine(sp) cream on it. Glad I still have no feeling under the right side or it would hurt like hell. Can feel my collar bone and front of my chest and those spots hurt bad enough. I'm completely raw and since I finally had my last treatment (Thursday the 24th) it is trying to heal. Now it cracks and bleeds though.
