So tired of hearing that I should go to the best or second opinion. Everybody told me to go to one doctor, in my small town. And we do not have the new 3 D mammogram machine. But I had a mammo every year but had dense breasts so harder to detect. I was told my last mammo that I passed and then a few months later felt a lump in the shower. And not in the breast they were following and put a clip in!!",
