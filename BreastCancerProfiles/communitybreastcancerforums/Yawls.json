My RO mentioned in an offhand way at the beginning, that there probably wouldn't be too much evidence of the rads until the second half of treatment...if there was going to be any. I of course zeroed in on the first part of his statement. So when the machine broke down at exactly the half way point, all I could think of was how much worse it was going to get and how much longer is was going to last! Not the most positive (or rational) thinking for sure! Anyway the Xanax is doing the trick and other than tired life is doable again, yea!

Today I felt very creative and clever...I used a really soft footie between breast and bra. The gauze was too scratchy and I just wanted something that would not shed or stick. It worked! There's a brand of socks called The Worlds Softest Socks they are almost like fleece but not so shaggy. It also gave the rads techs a bit of a giggle, which was good because I wasn't my usual cheery self. Tired and sore wondering how the next couple of weeks are going to play out. Off to bed...",

My oh so sweet RO said, \"you know, the gals with big breasts often have this breakdown where the skin lies directly on top of other skin\". What he was really saying was when your boobs don't sit up all small and perky, they tend to flop over. When you are getting the beam, it goes through both layers of skin, thus almost like a double dose. Today was 23/34. One more week before the boosts begin. My team keeps telling me I'm doing great, I love them, so I'm going to believe them! Tammy, I gotta admit to you, I am not above when someone says boy, you look tired, putting on an even more pitiful tired look, agreeing, then hiding out in my office!!

Even if your tumor is a little more spread out, you still have enough tissue to do the lumpectomy and still not be too lopsided. For me, I had mucinous type Idc. Which means that my tumor is encapsulated within a jell like pool. The actual tumor was smaller but for my surgeon to remove it and get clear margins she had to do what she called a quadrectomy. My tumor was deep near my chest wall at about 5:00. She cut out the tissue from 4:00-6:00. If I were smaller, the surgeon said I probably wouldn't have been able to have the breast conserving surgery, I would have had to go for the mastectomy. In fact our deal was, no clean margins on the first try and we were going in for the double mastectomy. I was convinced that having this D on one side only would just keep me spinning in circles all the time. Lucky for me clear margins, clean nodes and an oncotype of 8 sent me right to rads. So I got done with the surgery looked down at myself and thought, hey this doesn't look that bad. From the front I pretty much look the same except the nipple is looking off to the left a little! From the side I look like I leaned on a heater and melted, just sort of flat. What that means for radiation is that when I lay on my back, the breast skin squishes down on the skin of my under arm. So now when they aim the beem it has to go through the two layers its only about a quarter of an inch, but the RO told me that that little bit usually gives large breasted women their biggest challenge. Today was number 24, 5 more days, then 6 days of boosts. RO says boost is just going to incision site. I'm still wearing a bra. I'm wearing the nice cotton cacique's from lane Bryant like Terry. It's soft and goes up high on the sides to hold everything up, but its low enough in front that I can still wear a scoop neck sweater set. Today I put a soft cotton pad between breast and bra because the lidocaine is gooey. But I was not to uncomfortable at work so...so far so good. Thanks to all for the encouragement, I check in as soon as I get done with treatment each day, makes me feel more \"normal\" to know others are where I am!",

My incision site is also purple, compared to the red skin around it. I have been using Remedy Skin Repair lotion that my RO keeps me supplied with. It smells good and when I am done, I use what's left on my hands on my face...it has never looked smoother! The down side? I rush everyday to tx from work, my boss lets me leave early each day. It's about a 45 minute drive that I try to make in exactly 45 minutes! Anyway I got there last Friday and was met by my two lovely techs withe the news that the machine was down so no treatment. It was supposed to be my 1/2 way treatment, a mile stone in my head. They didn't have my cell so they couldn't get me ahead of time. I went home worried. They tell you at the start of treatment not to plan on even missing one day. I so took that to heart! Went home with the promise that the machine would be fixed on Monday if not they would call. Uneventful weekend. Call early Monday, machine still down...I had no idea that this break in my treatment flow could so totally wig me out. Nightmares, anxiety by the time the machine was up on Tuesday, I could hardly stand to lay on the table. Mind you I had done it 15 other days without even a twinge...I was sure the machine wasn't fixed and it was nuking me to death. I was a mess. Of course when I was done I made a joke withe the tech. That night I had the momma of all nightmares. Could barely get up and talk my self into going to work the next morning. Thankfully, I have the best rads team! It was Dr. day so as soon as the nurse closed the door and asked so...I burst into tears, he listened, went out to see RO before you know it, I have a dose of Ativan and a prescription for Xanax. I would never have guessed that I was wound so tight, especially because my body seemed to really cooperate with the rads treatment. The moral of my story, we all need help sometimes, BC is heavy duty stuff! Our treatments take a toll as much on our minds as our bodies, pay attention to what your body is telling you and don't be to shy to melt down if you need to.",

This topic speaks to exactly where I am at currently. I have a second appointment with my mo (it still sounds so weird to say my mo) on Tuesday when my oncotype results will be discussed. I went in to my first post surgery appointment 99% sure that I was going to refuse chemo if it was suggested. I was trying to keep an open mind because I am really not interested in dying from BC anytime soon. After exhaustive study on mucinous type IDC, which says early stage node free BC typically does not call for chemo, I was still willing to listen to my MOs opinion. Truthfully I was hoping he would not recommend. Well he showed me adjunct online statistics, and said that he would be much more comfortable if I followed a TC 4x course. The adjunct online did not take into consideration the mucinious type and the low proliferation numbers Ki67 8%. Mitotic grade 1. The upshot of the conversation was that MO would order oncotype. He was clear that he understood my concerns of over treatment and quality of life versus long term SEs but that he was hoping that if the oncotype results were in the inconclusive range that I would go ahead with chemo. My questions...what exactly is chemo light? Does anyone else have my same tumor situation? If so what did you decide?",
