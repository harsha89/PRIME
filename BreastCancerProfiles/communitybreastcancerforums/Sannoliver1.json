I live in a small town with limited options but am considering hitting this LE with everything I've got early. I am looking for any guidance on inpatient CDT in the US (Seattle maybe?) for stage 1 lymphedema. Does that even exist? If not, I'd be willing to travel to one of the overseas clinics. Has anyone done this? You ladies further down the road are so helpful and willing to share your knowledge. I thank you in advance. Hugs Log in to post a reply",

Did they have you wear it right after surgery? Do you get Mld? What does your surgeon say? Gosh I just feel awful that the LE spread to abdomen too. Sometimes life is so unfair.",

Stable? I have mild bilateral arm and truncal Lymphedema. I wear the garments and do mld, but have about 40 lbs more than I should. Also wondering how much weight loss helps with mild lymphedema. I just can't get any traction dropping the pounds because I'm not a slow and steady type. I'm all in and over do the exercise ... And then I flare so I back off. Thanks for any input.
