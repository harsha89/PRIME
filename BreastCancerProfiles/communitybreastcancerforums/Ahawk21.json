I just received a call back on my mamo saying I need to go back for ultrasound and diagnostic MRI. They say my left breast is very dense tissue and a 6mm area they need to check close to the chest wall.....I'm scared out of my wits.... But I had this lump since my last mamo and it hasn't grown from what I've noticed- ugh any encouraging words? Thank you all- Log in to post a reply",
