He was telling me since I was only 22 a mammogram was not the way to go. Since I was so young and the radiation wouldn't be good on me. He also said the ultrasound is a good thing but since my breast were so lumpy and dense the MRI was the best option for me. He did say that he saw the lump and would be clearer in the MRI. I mean is this a good thing or bad. He was said I had age on my side but that is about it. Can they look at the MRI and say yes she has breast cancer or will  they have to do a biopsy first. I'm scared to death and dont know what to think. Tera Log in to post a reply",

I was at my regular yearly app. when he had found 4 small cyst. I had them taking out and everything was ok. There was no sign of cancer which was a blessing from GOD. Then about 3 months ago I was doing my usual exam when I found something that felt very weird to me. I have very very lumpy breast anyways so i didnt really think much of it. Until this off white/ bloody looking discharge started happening. I made myself think that it was because I just had a baby last October. But it was still very strange cause it was only coming out of the one that I had discovered the lump. I finally got the courage to see my dr. I had told her what all was going on and she too felt the lump and told me that it did feel very strange to her. She told me that she was going to get me an app. with a breast specialist. This whole ordeal scares me to death. I have no one to talk to talk to about this cause no one really knows what i'm going thru. I so tired of hearing it will be ok because I dont know that it will. I'm scared that because i'm so young they will dismiss me. If anyone has any advice for me i really need it!!! Tera Log in to post a reply",

They said my right breast looked fine (which my lump isnt in that one but it's good to hear) and they left they seen the lump and would be best to have takin out. Can a person look at the MRI results and tell if a mass is B9 or is cancer?  I really dont know what to think at this point. I dont know if the info she gave me was good or bad. I guess I'll just talk to my dr and see what she has to say about it. And that means more waiting, I hate waiting!!!! Tera Log in to post a reply",
