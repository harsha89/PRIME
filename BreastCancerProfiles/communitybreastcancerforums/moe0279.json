Here's a low down on my side effects with taxol....very little nausea only a couple of times, constipation, diaheria, hemmroids, (those 3were constant every week) sore mouth, RASH on chest and chin....not sure if that from taxol or steroids, right big toe and pads of feet numb. At the beginning I had hot flashes thru my hands and feet, I took l-glutimime for the neuropathy...it's funny because I would say that taxol was not that bad...I only missed tx day and 2 other days during the 3 months...my hair started to fall out, but now it's growing and been growing for about6 weeks..so good news for those who have lost their hair... My first few tx took a while but once they my sure your not going to have reactions, they will probably up the flow...at the end I was getting finished with taxol in about 2 hrs...I didn't have to take nausea meds or neulasta during taxol...have colase, imodium, and gas x on hand....lol...u just don't know which you will need..I've tried head and shoulders for the rash, steroid cream and hydicortozone...steroid cream worked the best. Now that i'm aal done with this round and have 2 weeks off, I seem to be having more side effects...lots more fatigue...has anyone else had this problem...my feet, hands, muscles have been cramping like crazy....my nose is completely raw. And I feel exhausted and shake all the time..I talked with my onco about this and she says it the withdrawal from steroids and of course the tx... On march29 I will have my first tx of AC... I'm so nervous, can anyone tell me what to expect with the first tx...I'm not sure if I should take that first week off work or plan to work...I have a great principal and she will work with me...I can't seem to shake this fear of AC...just thinking about makes me want to cry...I know I will get thru it, but I'm scared...thanks all for listening...",

I wanted to tell everyone about my trip to UNC with my boys yesterday.. My oldest son (6 years old) is a worry wort...he has been having difficult monday's each week since i started having chemo..so i had an idea for the boys to come see me at the hospital while i get chemo...My ocon and the head nurse thought it was a good idea and let us have a private chemo room...and they got to stay the whole time...While i slept they got to explore the hospital with my DH and mom...I felt like it was so beneficial for them to see the process. Now Ayden knows \"mom's not bleeding to death each time you get chemo\"  Who knew that was what he was so worried about...i wouldn't have know that had i not asked him yesterday... They were so good and well behaved that the head nurse invited them back anytime...we let them take a camera to take pictures to share with their classrooms...here's my caring bridge page with their pictures!!! www.caringbridge.org/visit/melissaparker1 jcoutee, I just finish taxol #6 yesterday...I believe that the tx are stacking up...I actually slept most of the ride home yesterday...Im glad your se's are not so bad... JulieH, I also work at a school.  I will eventually go commando...the other teacher and faculty have been so supportive of this whole process.  We have a Wear it Wednesday each week after my treatment..Its been so great!  The teachers answer the students questions as they come...My son's teacher has let him talk to the class about the whole process as much as he wants...Its great to have support at school..The students will be able to handle it..if they have questions then just answer them as honestly as possible...The parents of my students were glad i had a talk with them...there was no way i could hide the fact that was had no hair...so now as a class we wear scarf, hats and bandannas... I started using hydrcortizone (sp?) cream for my sore itchy head!!!!  I hope everyone has a good week with few side effects....",

Well today was definitely the hardest....I couldnt decide what I wnated to wear, Hat? wig?, or scarf?  I kept telling myself i should wear a wig so I don't freak my students out at school (my Students with autism don't usually like change), so in the end i decided on a wig...different color and different style, but i like it alot! for the first little while i didnt even leave my room, but after a while i got brave and went out into the school and everyone was wonderful..they built my confidence and made me feel beautiful...today i left at 11:30 and i quickly took that wig off driving down the road...it was itchy and annoying...I even wore a wig cap under it and it made it worse...hope know one was watching, if so, i would love to have seen that expression!!!LOL Once i got home, i tried a pink scarf and love it...i felt so much better and more confident...so for now ive decided to try hats and scarves...I do have the wigs so that gives me more of a selection..ann97 i agree, i felt the same as you...just didn't feel right...but wear the bandana out i felt more me and natural...one of these days i hope to be brave enough to go without anything!

Ive tried drinking my 8 glasses of water each day, and cutting back my food intake, but i will tell you when i get the munches i get them and want to eat...soooo of course i eat... I hate to say it, i thought that i could at least loose weight if i was going to have cancer...but i guess God has other plans...ive started walking a mile a couple days a week as i can...im willing to try anything at this point, i don't have enough $$$ to go out an buy new clothes along with all the dr visits and meds....Maybe we can loose together! ",
