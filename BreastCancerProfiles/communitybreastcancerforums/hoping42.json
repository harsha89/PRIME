I won't lie, I am so very scared, as I know you can relate!!!  If you can muster any other encouraging words and support, I would so appreciate it.  Thanks again for being there---just wish different reasons.  (:  I am all consumed, even though I am trying not to think about this every second.

      "Content": "hoping42 wrote: Okayt, First of all I am trying to feel optimisitic and positive about the ultimate results after my biopsy Tuesday.  Again, they are doing a stereotactic needle biopsy for new microcalcifications.  I so wish I had the report, I don't.  My mom seems to remember them showing that they were clustered in some way?  My brain went fuzzy, just remember they look like grains of salt, suspicious and biopsy recommended.  Birads 4.  New from last year and only on the left. My questions are a few, so bear with me. 1.  I think one of the reasons I am freaking out so bad is that I called my gynocologist's office in mid-December to tell them that I had some real itching and a tiny bit of discharge from what appeared from a crack in my nipple or a scap I scraped off?  They said try some cortisone creams and if it didn't help to let them know and they would call in a perscription.  Well, it did improve.  But, still there--left nipple only.  It almost looks like I can see a \"hole\" with tiny creases in the shaped of an astric with a tiny full red circle all around it.  It also appears a little flatter acorss the top compared to the other one, but not inverted.  I also experience a little tingling especially when putting something on it.  The \"cut\" has healed to that smaller hole. Nothing on the aereola seems different.  The thing is is that the calcifications they found by digital mammography (screening) were not found under my nipple but the upper outer left quadrant, but to be honest I remember them putting that cone piece of that machine more in the upper left inner but maybe that is just how it felt because it was flatened so much.  Anyway, if this and again IF is cancerous is there anyway that this could have started from this nipple?  Do you think the radiologist would have noticed if there was something uncommon with my nipple when he was doing the ultrasound which again was on the upper left quadrant and under my arm?  2.  Due to the advice of some wonderful people here-I am calling my gyno tomorrow to ask for a prescription to be called in in attempt to calm a bit before the biopsy.   Do you think that I can ask them to order a punch skin biopsy to check for Paget's as long as I will be numb and have such concerns about the changes in my nipple?  I am hoping that the nipple itchiness, etc. is just a coincidence of winter skin and I will still get a benign result.  I just want to ask what you ladies think. 3.  I am not doing the Dr. Google thing as told by the wise ladies here--but it is hard, but I did when I first noticed the change in my nipple.  I guess I was glad that it was responding with over the counter stuff and figured that if something was wrong they would be able to tell by the mammogram---but I guess that is not always the case.   4.  Does anyone else feel like the can feel their breasts every minute? Thank you!  Again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
