It seems to hit me about 6 pm ish and is a fatigue that makes me weepy. Its not so much I want to sleep....it's more an I can't cope type feeling and I can't wait to get my clothing off and just lie on my bed. I feel so gratful to have had early stage DCIS,Â  an easy time with treatment, a supportive husbad and friends and every reason in the world to feel good , so I dont think this is depression but could the radiation cause this \"fatigue'' that seemed to start a few weeks after treatment. I dont see my oncologist until an 8 week post radiation check up middle of Jan. Best Wishes to every one and may 2009 be a year filled with good health, happiness and the best of life for all of us!

I know most of it is sun damage from my foolish youth but it did seem to get much worse after radiation. I spoke with a dermatoligist today but he has no experience with post radiation patients as far as using a laser to lighten these spots and does not know how long after radiation I should wait to have this done.Any one have any idea who could give me any info ........ Thanx and the best to all! Log in to post a reply",
