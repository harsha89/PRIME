    "Content": "rockingmom wrote: I have a question maybe someone can answer. I have 2 sister with stage 2 and stage 4 breast cancer. I had a category 3 mamogram. They then did a 3D mamogram and ultrasound. I was referred to a surgeon and she has now ordered an MRI. Why do they not eliminate mamogram and ultrasound for women who have breast cancer in their family? My sister were just diagnosed in the last 2 months. We are working on getting the BRACA tests. It just seems like an avoidable expense to get the mamograms and ultrasound when the only true clear pictures are MRI's? I know plenty of women who have had breast cancer and the mamogram was negative. Log in to post a reply",
