Explaining more in details about my treatment and my options.. He informed me that the next two were up to me if I wanted to continue or stop.. He understood all my concerns and told me that having all three completed the A/C and 2 Taxol only increases my chances of it not returning by three percent.. Since I already had 4 of A/C and two of taxol then I have increased my chances by 1 1/2 percent..we decided not to do the Neulasta shot this week and see how my body feels.. He also suggested that I could come once a week for treatment but that would extend me out 8 weeks instead of the four that is not an option..the every two weeks to be done On September 16 works for me.  If I continue I will be completely done on September 16. If I return on September 2 and my blood count is not up then we will have to wait another week.. Which might not be as effective.. He stopped the Neulasta because it causes bone pain along with Taxol, so I was in double the pain.. Hopefully I won't be in much with out the Neulasta.. I am going to think ahead and start with the Tylenol and Motrin..  @Cheyenne, and Sherry, if I have not learned anything from these posts is that you are not alone.. I actually started up a discussion on my own, it is titled help me please... I was feeling so many emotions and no one that I talked to seem to understand why one minute I would be fine and the next one I would be a nervous wreck.. I too locked my self in my room on many of days.. I was off of work during my first two months of treatment and I think that was the worst for me i had nothing to do but lie in bed all day and think of all the horrible things that has happened to me over the last year.. I lost my mother in October of 09 and was diagnosed with cancer in March of 10.. I will give you one advice that has helped me on this long journey TALK..TYPE what ever you want to call it.. but talking to others that have gone through or are going through what I am seem to help me find strenght that I didn't know I had.. so many times I wanted stop and give up early in the game.. but I would log on and read and read all the encouraging words.. For those going through taxol.. I take xanax with the steriods to help me sleep the night before and the night of treatment.. The benadryl has me drowsy but it doesn't put me in the sleep good state. the xanax takes me there.   I send to you lots of hugs and encourgement that was sent to me.. Hugs and smiles.. hang in there.. one person told me that Cancer was for the weak and it was time for me to put my big girl panties on...LOLOL.. WELL I PUT THEM ON..",

I am finished but the side effects are still coming.. tingling and numbness.. my last treatment was a week ago and I am still feeling it.. I guess it takes a while to get out of my system.. I am loosing eyelashes everyday, the hair on my arms seems to be growing back, i can't tell if it is growing anywhere else.. I decided I was going to stop inspecting my hair daily because it only becomes deperessing.. I guess i had a false sense of reality.. I thought that when the chemo stopped, my hair would grow back just as fast as it fell out.. I thought that I would be perfectly back to normal.. Well Sunday and Monday I could barely walk.. So ladies don't make the mistake i made.. I still haven't really celebrated yet.. can't think of anything to do that is not expensive.. Open to any idea.. Really happy for those that have finished with me, and those that will be finishing soon.. So glad for the ones that haven't had any side effects.. Hugs and kisses to all..",

I am just in the healing stage, already had the mx in May. I think that is where my mistake was I stopped drinking the fluids.. I would be hungry but not thirsty.. now I am thirsty again and I am chugging down pop and vitamin water.. the husband and I were thinking about a Ny trip... really just a thought once i checked airfare..  chey, you sound wonderful.. so glad your feeling better..",

It gets worse then it starts to ease up.. It is not in my feet as much as in my hands and my last treatment was exactly two weeks and three days ago.. my fingers are still real sensative to water especially hot water. I find it very hard to wash dishes.. but my feet are not as bad as they were.. did anyone experience peeling of the skin with sever dryness.. Daniela, congratulations on finishing chemo.. and to anyone else that I didn't mention.. My bucket list.. umm to marry my husband again on the beach and watch my children get married and have kids of their own..",
