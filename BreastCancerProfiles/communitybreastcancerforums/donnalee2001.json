    "Content": "donnalee2001 wrote: I had a biopsy that showed MILD ductal atypical hyperplasia in one block, but multiple calcifications throughout the breast. No family history of cancer, but family history of heart disease and stroke. Do I have surgery to remove the 1 atypical duct, just to 6 month \"look-sees\", or start Tamoxifen? I am peri-menopausal at almost 57. Mother didn't start menopause until 60. Please give suggestions. Log in to post a reply",
