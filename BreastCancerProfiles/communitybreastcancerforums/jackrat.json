      "Content": "jackrat wrote: Hello I am new to this forum. My mum was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 70 and my auntie (her sister) was diagnosed at 79 (they are both still alive) but she had cancer in both breasts so I now visit my family history clinic and mammograms yearly. I am apparantly not considered a high risk but enough to keep monitored. Last night I felt a very tiny difference in my right breast - it feels almost like a small spot just below the surface but also a bit like a tiny cyst. I have to really feel round for it though. I feel like I am making a fuss about nothing but don't really want to ignore it.Â  My question is; do I go to my GP or shall I contact the family history clinic at the hospital or shall I wait in case it is just a spot developing? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
