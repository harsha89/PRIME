So I am not mad, I had to see him so I could start chemo...Everything was brighter on this scan even stuff that doesn't have cancer so something happened. I really like my oncologist, he is always willing to talk to me and listen to me...I am slowly relaxing more...we may do a bone scan after 2 more treatments, we may wait 3 months..we are gonna go on Tumor Markers, other labs and how I feel, The good thing is my organs looked great...and bone mets don't kill people they just hurt...which I have very little pain.",
