Thankfully, on the HER2+, my ki67 is low(10%) and my lymph nodes are clear. I have decided on double mastectomy w/reconstruction and will probably need chemo after that. Instead of doing chemo before surgery. 2 reasons, I don't need the tumor to shrink to have a lumpectomy (I've decided on bi-lat mx) and also I want to be healthy and feeling well when I have the surgery. This has been a tough 2 months waiting. I've learned quite a lot, but am still a newbie with all the terms and what they mean.. Please let me know what to expect in the immediate days after my surgery. Log in to post a reply",

My Her2+ has two markers that are low...my ki67 and no lymph nodes are showing cancerous. I turned 60 this year and have had 5 needle biopsies through the years in numerous spots on both breasts, I've had two benign cysts removed from my right breast. This is why I've decided to have a bi-lat mx. I would like peace of mind. I will probably need chemo after surgery, but I would prefer the surgery first.. I'm feeling good, I'm healthy and the weather is nice outside, which I feel all this will help with my recovery. Now, I just need to learn what the first few weeks after mx will be like.",
