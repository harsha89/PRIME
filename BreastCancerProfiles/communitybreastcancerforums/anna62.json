I was diagnosed on Sept 30th but have just been able to post within the last few days.  I am desperately trying to find a forum site that I was looking at the other day, is was about recovery from mast surgery.  I want my husband to read it so that we can plan the home setup when I get back from the hospital.  The forum had different woman writing about their experiences once they came home from surgery.  Any ideas ???

I have another consult with a different PS on the 28th say hello to everyone for me. Anna",
