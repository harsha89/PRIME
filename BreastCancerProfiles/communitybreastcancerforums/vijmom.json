However, the mammography and sonography of the breast found no lumps. The sonography also found a malignant node on the left axillary region (although a biopsy has not been done here so far). According to the immunohistochemical staining results for the cervical lymph node (on the neck), the Tumor Cells are ER(+), PR(+), HER-2(-), GCDFP-15(+), and TTF-1(-). Would I still have late stage breast cancer if mammography and sonography have found nothing? What'll be my life expectancy? Log in to post a reply",

Cervical lymph node on my neck is between the ear and my shoulder.  I still have to find a good doc and take the next step.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed and hope to attend my grand daughter's wedding(She's 6).",
