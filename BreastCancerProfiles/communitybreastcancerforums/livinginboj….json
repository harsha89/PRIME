It feels like when you have your hair up in a pony tail for a long time then take it down. Not really tingling or pain. Just wierd. And I must of jinxed myself because this morning I lost about 50 hairs in the shower another 25 or so in the sink, while doing my hair. Then when I grabbed a handful to curl with the curling iron, about 1/2 of it came out in my hands! That was a shock! So after work tomorrow, my best friend is going to give me a buzz cut! As far as a metallic taste, no I have not had that. I do have a wierd taste and sort of dry mouth but it's not metallic. I know the gum I usually chew tastes different but most foods taste the same. And no I haven't any any mouth sores. I thought about using the biotene toothpaste just in case. How does it taste? I think I get some for the trip as I won't be able to get anyting on the ship. Might as well be prepared! Thanks again for writing back. Take care! My next tx is Oct. 4, so I be writing again soon. Your attitude is amazing! Keep it up girl! Cheryll",

I have about 1/4\" to 1/2\" fuzz but its not very thick. Hopefully it will fill in again. It would suck to go thru all of this and end up with funkier hair than I had before. I thought maybe it would fall out again with each tx. I see onc today and will ask about follow up tests. I'm curious about that too. It would seem weird to just be done and that's it! I have to do rads yet. Anyone else? How long before you begin after finishing chemo. My onc said to wait a month but I'd rather not. I'd like to finish before the end of the year as to not have to meet another deductible. Karyll, did you not say that you were having your cycle every 2 wks? Is that still happening? I was too but know its been a month since my last and hoping that its the begininng of the end of the cycles. I haven't had too much chemopause symptoms. Not really hot flashes but my head feels really hot and sweaty. When I'm home alone I can't wait to take of the scarf just to cool down. I haven't had night sweats or trouble sleeping either. YEA!!! Hope I didn't just jinx myself. Hope the rest of you are doing well. I'm really nervous about #4 on 11/15, trying not to think about it too much. It seems each tx takes longer to snap back and I want to enjoy turkey day with the my kids (not too mention I'll be doing the cooking).",

We can always use a smile or better yet a good laugh. I have 6 rads left and yesterday had my first \"boost\" which is rads concentrating directly on where the tumor was. It doesn't hurt, but my boob is really red and itches somewhat. My nipple is extremely tender and has peeled, reminds me of breastfeeding (25 yrs ago). My armpit is very dark (the most tan I've ever been) and the area where they took nodes is tender/sore. I had to go to chiropractor for my shoulder it was killing me, often waking me up in the night. She said that the radiation has irritated the whole muscle that wraps around the back and armpit attached to shoulder. Its very common in BC patients so now I have some goofy exercises to do. For the last week or so I get little sharp pains that come and go. I am assuming I can thank rads for that. lol! I had 8 tatoos, they are so small (like a little freckle) but got a 9th one yesterday. That one smarted a bit and really bled, I had to stuff my bra with kleenex as they couldn't put a bandaid on it as it would tear the skin. (I haven't stuffed my bra for 30+ years! ). I think the 1/2 way mark b/w NC and CA would maybe be Iowa!!! You'd all be welcome at my house!!!  Wouldn't that be fun! September chemo ladies unite!!! Take care one and all!",

Whether it was from finishing treatment, chemopuase, empty nest syndrome, mid-life (51), loneliness, ....or all of the above. Regular MD put me on lexapro and that helped.

I have tried to play catch up and read some of the latest messages and then run out of time or get too tired to reply so decided to write first then finish reading. I was on my cruise the week of 9/24 thru 9/29. Had an awesome time! My onc. delayed 2nd tx so I could go and didn't express any concerns regarding the germs on the flight or the cruise. Interesting?!?! I had to shave my head before we left so wasn't thrilled with any of the pics taken on the trip. I won't go bald in public as I think I look like Uncle Fester from the Adam's family. But those of you that have posted your pictures look really beautiful! I applaud you! I had my 2nd tx last Thurs. the 6th, felt great on Fri. took 4mg Zofran Thurs. night and then every 6 hrs. Woke up Sat. AM with nausea and actually threw up a couple times. As I posted earlier I had NO meds after 1st tx (and was really sick with dry heaves). So I was really disappointed that I got sick WITH meds. I called Onc. dept. and spoke to my onc. and he was quite abrupt with me and told me to triple up on the meds! I had taken 1 pill at 6AM and now it was 9AM, so he said to take 2 more. I continued to take 3 every dose and backed down to 2 this Am at 4AM but felt nauseous this AM and just finished taking 3 again at 11:30. Has anyone else heard of doing this? I'm thinking that Zofran is not the drug for me! I don't have any other meds. The premedicate me with zofran, decadron and an ativan push. Then the A/C. I do have some compazine but was told that I should use the zofran first because its stronger. My next tx is 10/25 but I see onc. on the 18th, and would like to have some input on what to ask for meds. I am happy to say that I'm 1/2 way done and will glad to be done! I hate this! For those of you getting great treatment at your cancer center, I am so happy for you! I can't imagine getting a foot massage! How awesome! I've heard that chemo is cumulative so each tx can make you more fatigued, etc. I think I agree! I had a hard time climbing out of bed and getting to work this AM. I just try to stay busy and hope the day goes by fast! Only 3 hrs. to go! Take care all of you wonderful women! I look forward to some responses on meds. God bless us all! Cheryll",

Now to change the subject, does anyone have any problems with tearing. I can't get my eyes to stop tearing. I thought dry eyes was a se of chemo but I'm having the opposite effect. Guess maybe I should see an eye doctor to rule out any infection. My eyes aren't \"mattering\" (sp) just the constant tearing. God bless us all!",

My nipple/aerola is not brown anymore only red. Skin has peeled from the area. Uncomfortable but not horrible. The fatigue is getting worse. Really tired, wake up tired. I too have worked through the whole tx process and wondering if I might need to take a week off to rest. I get 4 wks. vacation this year and wondering if maybe I shouldn't take advantage of the extra week. I hate to use up vacation for \"rest\" but can't afford to go anywhere anyway. Has anyone else tracked how much the whole treatment has cost? I just surpassed the $80,000 mark. Thank God for insurance! Still have the co-pays and deductible but its doable (as long as they don't want it paid in full in until about 2010! LOL!) I think my other boob is having sympathy pains! It's been sore for a couple of days. It doesn't look any different, but the irritation is around the nipple, hard to describe but feels like the when you get chapped from going braless (like way back when I was a young). Anyone know what I mean? Wierd. Went out to supper with another lady (I met in rads) and her husband. She had her last tx yesterday. It was good to go out and have something to celebrate. I bought her one of the singing Hallmark cards and the waitress mistook it for her birthday so after we finished our meal, she brought her a mini-cake with a candle in it. We all laughed and told her what we were celebrating. She said that that was more important than a birthday! Hopefully we can stay in touch. Tri-thanks for the invite but I too will have to say no. I don't own a bike, it would probably kill me! But more importantly I can't afford the trip to FL. I plan to have a team for Relay for Life which is on July 12/13, one week before my 1 yr. anniversary. I need to start \"training\" for that-as I am overweight and out of condition BIG TIME! I know its not as physical as the Danskin thing...so right up my ally! LOL! Hope all of you are doing well! Take care!",

Maybe should have posted after I found the pertinent info. Anyway, it is an excellent book about life after bc. In the first couple of chapters I found some very good quotes and thought I'd share. 1. It is a strange disease indeed that leaves you feeling far worse at the completion of treatment than you did at the time of diagnosis! 2. Why waste a good day worrying about a possible bad day in the future? 3. Many women feel that bc has given them a second chance. Grab it and hold on for dear life! I say AMEN to all three. If anyone is interested I will get the name and author info to you. It really is a good book. Take care ladies!",

The surgery was a breeze and the A/C was fine also. Felt great that night and even the next day, I went to work, etc. But that night the nausea hit like a tons of bricks. The onc dept. was a zoo the day I was in and they \"forgot\" to send me home wth any meds. I was sick as a dog all weekend. Made sure I kept fluid intake up but could barely get anything down besides a piece of toast.Monday called my doc. and they called in nexium to calm the stomach down and some zofran. Then onc. dept. called to see how 1st tx went and after I explained everything they apologized (a lot of good that did me!) so they called in script of compazine. I only took two doses of compazine and took nexium for 3 days just to get everything calmed down, now I'm feeling good. I'm ready for anything next tx (10/4)! I had bloodwork drawn on Thurs. but they couldn't access the port! So after 3 pokes by the lab tech in my arm they finally got the blood drawn! Now I have the beginning of a cold so they put me on an antibiotic. Good grief! I feel a little tired but then I did anyway!  I get up for work at 5 AM so when I get home at 3:30 I'm ready for a short nap. Last night was the first I slept a full 7 hrs without getting up to pee! Too much water! I wish the best to all of you and for those of you that haven't had tx yet please be sure that you go home with a script for anti-emetic, if they don't offer, ASK! Take care ladies!

Just keep telling myself that I'll never feel this way again! I did go to the eye dr. and he assured me that everything was good. As I said I was scared to death of diabetic retinopathy but he assured me I was fine. He also said all 3 rows of eye lashes were still there, but I have noticed they are a little thinner. Hopefully I won't lose them completely as I'm done with chemo. He did put me on antibiotic eye drops with steroids in it just to be on the safe side and it helped with the swollen lids and the haloes disappeared. Thanks to all of you who replied to ?'s about the tearing. It's not a major problem anymore only occassionally. I still feel really tired   but  guess I'll  just have to deal with it. I met with rads onc. the morning of my last chemo. I really like him. I start rads Dec. 3 for 6 wks. (30 txs). One week will carry into 2008 which sucks as far as having to meet another deductible, but what can we do? In earlier readings someone shared a recipe. I tried 2 new recipes this year and my family loved them. One is for Reba Mcintire's Sweet Potato Praline Casserole and the other is Pumpkin Pecan Pie. If anyone is interested I'll post them. I honestly don't like sweet potatoes or pecans or pumpkin (yes, I am a very picky eater) but wanted to try something new for the kids and they really loved them both. So let me know if anyone is interested. Hope all of you spent the day with family and friends you love. Peace to us all. Going to try to survive Black Friday and go shopping the kids. Sure hope the energy comes back soon! God bless us all!",

I plan to make an appt w/ reg. md in Jan. as I need a pap, etc. I am amazed at all of you that exercise, where do you find the energy? I work 40 hrs a week and then drive 20 miles to rads and back home and its all I can do to make supper. It took me a week and half to finish decorating for Christmas and 4 nights of baking to finish up. I don't know how you guys do it. I am overweight and haven't gained (or lost) any during treatment. I know I need to get my weight under control (esp. to ward off any recurrence) but I just don't have the energy. I have never worn a night cap and sleep w/ only a sheet and light blanket. The blanket gets kicked off 4-5 times during the night. I haven't tried any meds for the hot flashes although offered by onc. I start tamoxifen after done w/ rads and will probably need it then as I hear that t. causes severe hot flashes. GREAT!! My hair has continued to grow SLOWLY, it's 3/4 \" long but still thin. So I'm still wearing a hat/scarf. So far still coming in straight, was hoping for curly so I wouldn't have to pay for perms! lol! I have about 20 hairs on each leg that have started to grow too, guess I'll have to break out the razor one of these days. After this week I will be half way done w/ rads! YEA!!! I have noticed some redness, like a light sunburn and my armpit feels chafed when I dry it after a shower. And TIRED w/ a capital T, but that's it. A lady donated a beautiful afghan (in 6 diferent shades of pinks) that she made and wanted it to be given to someone with bc. And I am the LUCKY recepient! It really is gorgeous! I've never won anything before. They just gave it to me yesterday after my treatment and took my picture for the paper , I HATE my picture taken, especially now. Now if I could get over the hot flashes so I could use it! lol! Just wanted to touch base  and wish you all a very Merry Christmas! 2008 is going to rock!!!!!",

I am having a hell of time. So damn emotional I can't stand myself. Finally went to the family doc and put me on lexapro. I don't know if it's chemopause/menopause, depression from finishing tx, or separation anxiety from my kids (ages 21 & 25). It started around the holidays, the first time I've had to share my kids (with their significant others and their families), so I finally got off the pity pot about that and then 2 weeks ago I invited (3 separate times) my daughter and her boyfirend over for supper and was turned down as they had plans with his family. I fell apart! I was a complete basketcase all weekend, crying that wouldn't stop. Then I got mad at myself for carrying on. I hate this!!!!! Anyone else feel so pathetic? They say it will take about 2 wks. for AD to kick in. I'm feeling better now but who knows what might set me off again? Hmmm, guess I didn't really make a long story short did I? I live alone-exhusband left me 6 yrs. ago for the neighbor lady (I use the word \"lady\" very loosely) after 20 yrs. Part of the problem I'm sure is that I hate being alone so much. I'm not lonely ie: needing or wanting a man in my life; just hate being alone all of the time. I started walking at the Y so hopefully that will help. Sorry for the venting.

So so spread the word to anyone else. Thank God I mentioned it!! Take care ladies! P.S. Pax I will put the book away and try again in a couple of weeks. I really want this new insite and need all the help I can get! :-)",

I was in the car yesterday and had to seriously stop and think of how to turn the car off!  SCAREY!! Back to the nostagia...my lunch box was Barbie, The Partridge Family and The Monkees! lol My favorite toys were all my Barbies. Did anyone have the one with plastic hair that came with 3 wigs? blonde, burnette and red head. Wigs...now thats appropriate! favorite jingles...I can remember all of the ones mentioned but can't be original to come up with any of my own. I have script for nexium...do you think they may help? I don't like taking 3 zofran every dose. Maybe I should take a nexium a day and back off to one zofran. Any thoughts? Today is day 5, last time I started to feel better by now.  Maybe the se are on the way out. I'm not taking steriods but its a pretty good bet that those of you that are taking them that is the reason for the weight gain. Be sure to watch your salt intake, including the salt already included in the foods your are eating. Paxton, I don't have a man in my life but I hear you regarding the emotions. Oh man! I can (and do) cry at the drop of a hat! Then I get made at myself for crying. I had to call the ER to get more zofran and I started crying while talking to ER nurse. She was very kind but I must have sounded like a babbling idiot! Take care everyone!! Cheryll",

I am divorced (for 6 years, after 20 yrs. of marriage) and my ex's family (at least part of them) have shown more concern that any of my extended family. I work w/ my brother so I see him 5 days a week. My parents winter in New Mexico but left town (from here) 2 days before my 1st tx. Sorry if I sound bitter. I have friends (at least I thought they were friends) for 20-25 yrs. and some of them have never acknowledged my cancer. Like you said cancer really does make people uncomfortable and they don't know what to say or do so they chose to do nothing. But it still hurts. My son choose to move away 2 wks. before my 1st tx and that really hurt. I think I cired more about that then I did about the diagnosis. That is one of the reasons I have reached out to all of you. At least we all understand what we are going through, especially all of the ups and downs of emotions. Chemo-pause doesn't help either! Well enough whining from me!",

I haven't gotten any burns yet but definitely feel the fatigue.3 weeks after chemo, I am now losing my big toe nails, at least I think I will lose them, they have turned black and very sensitive. The whole rad team is absolutely wonderful! They are so much better than my onc team. I have to drive 20 miles (one way) for 10 minute tx but at least its not further. And its worth it to be treated like a human being and not just a cancer patient. I know what you mean about being tempermental...holy buckets I'm 51 yrs. old and find myself having temper tantrums!! Luckily I live alone so there's no witnesses! LOL! I was driving home today and actually couldn't remember where I was! Luckily my daughter was with me but I think it scared her. Sure hope its not permanent! I find myself saying the wrong things too. Email for voice mail, etc. Anyone else? I had an appt. w/ onc. (I finally get to go 3 months now instead of every month). I asked him when I could get my port removed and he said that he likes to leave them for 1-2 yrs. because that's when the strongest chance of recurrence is! Boy, that was like a slap in the face! I haven't even finished tx and he talking about it coming back! He's a jerk! When he was closing the door to leave he said \"Maybe the next time I see you you'll have hair\"! I'm happy to not have to see him till March!! Take care ladies! Best of luck to those of you finishing chemo.",

The 1st tx I had NO meds and suffered miserably but lived to talk about it. The 2nd tx I had zofran and still suffered with n/v. Was told by onc. to triple the dose till I felt better and wound up with a miserable headache which is a se of an overdose of zofran. Last tx (10/25) added premeds of aloxi/decadron/emmend. Helped the n/v but still felt crappy. i rotated zofran and compazine. But its doable. Still went to work the next day. Lost my hair on day 14 after 1st tx. Just wearing scarves. My hair has started to come back-about 1/2\" to 1/2\" long but sparse. I'm 51 so no shock to notice there is a lot of \"sparkle\" to the new hair! My best advice to all of you lovely ladies is to drink as much water as you can stand and pay attention to you bodies. I did take dulcolax for a couple of days after each tx so never had constipation and sometimes have an occas. loose stool but nothing incapacitating as others have. Did you ever thing we'd share such things with anyone much less strangers? LOL! I also have port and it really doesn't cause me much discomfort. It's tender when trying to locate it (like pushing on a bruise) but I have horrible veins so would much rather have that then deal with 3 or 4 pokes each week. I go in each week b/w tx for blood draws. My tx are 3 wks apart. Sorry if I sound like I'm rambling but I'm trying to answer everyone's questions. I'm no expert but will gladly share any input I have to help others. Hi to Lori, you must be the closest in location to me. I'm in Spirit Lake, Iowa. Fall is definitely upon us! Good luck to all of you. Hope this posting has helped. Take care!",
