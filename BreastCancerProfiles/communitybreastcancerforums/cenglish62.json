My Dr reduced the dosage because my white cells have tanked and my insurance company will no longer pay for neupogen because I'm not curable. That was hard to hear. My Dr said the insurance company's recommended protocol is to delay treatment until white cells rebound on their own. We went ahead with treatment and I have strict instructions to go to the ER if I develop chills or a fever of 101. I hate insurance companies. Even though I have a PPO plan and pay large premiums, co-pays and additional out of pocket expenses all in an effort to get the best care possible, I'm still being \"managed\" by an insurance company. I just don't understand why my insurance company thinks the life of a metastatic cancer patient is less valuable than someone else's. It's hard to stay positive and focused on fighting disease when you have to battle with insurance too. Celeste",

I'm working full time as well, I currently have my treatment on Thursday afternoons and take the next day off to rest, I feel my worst Friday night and Saturday and then go to work Monday morning. I've had trouble with mouth discomfort and I run a fever (both not common side effects for everyone). I've been on a 3-week break, my doctor had me skip cycle 5, my tumor markers have been steadily going down but the numbness in my hands and feet became worrisome. I have noticed some improvement this week just in time for cycle 6 this Thursday. I do experience nausea but manage it with medication and old school remedies (ginger ale, crackers, small frequent meals, etc...). The fever can be difficult, but my doctor told me that is not a common side effect so maybe that won't happen to you. My white cell count has been an issue at times and some weeks I get a neupogen shot. This drug has not been too easy for me, but with my bad days falling on the weekend I've been able to maintain my work schedule. It really helps that my employer and co-workers are very supportive. I wish you well and hope you tolerate this drug well. I've been bald three times now over the last 6 1/2 years and have a fun collection of hats. I've learned to embrace my baldness and I now know that beauty comes from within. I can also sleep an extra 15 minutes every morning not having to worry about shampooing and blow drying what used to be thick unruly hair. I wish you all the best and hope you have success with this drug. Celeste",
