I pray for a positive diagnosis. The unknown is enough to drive anyone crazy. Just has to keep focused through meditation and prayer. Ill post tomorrow when I know something.",

I'm 36 years old and found a small hard oblong shaped lump in my lower armpit 3 weeks ago (like a uncooked grain of rice). I had a full hysterectomy at 30 and have been hormone replacement since. My gyn sent me to a breast specialist who did an ultrasound that showed nothing. She sent me for a mammogram that also showed nothing. There is definitely something there and I'm worried. There is no history of breast cancer in my family. Freaking out!!",
