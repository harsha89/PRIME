I just read on the testimonies here coz i just got curious this morning, i had search on \"itchiness on the areola\" and was bothered to read about the padget's disease which is a common breast cancer. I've been experiencing an itchiness on my left breast for quite some time now and i thought it is just because of the dryness of the weather here in california. I also noticed that the skin outside my areola became dark and i noticed also a \"blackhead-like\" very tiny lumps. I also saw a mole-like things on my breast area. The other thing is i have skin discoloration in some parts of my tummy, my left armpit (lower part near the breast) and it is itchy, i was thinking that discoloration is because i scratch it. But when read online, i got very worried. I am thinking to visit an ob gyne because my period suddenly became irregular and now this is another thing. I hope it is not padget's disease nor breast cancer. I strted crying after reading all the information. Praying that it is not breast cancer. Can somebody please tell me Or advise me on this? Thanks.",
