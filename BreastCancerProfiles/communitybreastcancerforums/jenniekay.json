I had it yesterday and they have decided to do a biopsy tomorrow. I am scared and worried....I was so numb when they were telling me the need for a biopsy, I didn't even hear everything the radiologist was saying. My mammo report says the spot hasn't grossly changed in 6 months, no difference in size but appears to be more dense. I honesty don't know what to think. They throw so much at me yesterday.....I guess I will figure it out as I go. I know the spot is .6cm (under a centimeter), round and smooth, and virtually no different then 6 months ago.
