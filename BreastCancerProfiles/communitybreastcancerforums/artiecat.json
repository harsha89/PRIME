I guess I just don't feel that my sx are enough to merit it. I have all my end of life paperwork in order, and I have plenty of support from family and friends. Part of the dilemma is that I live in Palm Springs and my doc is 2 hrs away where I used to live (health care here in the desert is not optimal). When it comes time that I am not able to manage on my own I will have to move over to my dtr's home, which is near the doc. It just doesn't make sense to me to start with a palliative team out here when I will be moving (which is a whole other issue). Appreciative your input, folks! I guess I am making some fairly simple decisions too complicated! And, I really didn't think I would still be putting along seven months after stopping all tx! (Nor did anyone else!)
