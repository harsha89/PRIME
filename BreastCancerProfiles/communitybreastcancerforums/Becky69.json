But I have extremely dense breast tissue/fibrocystic breast disease which is under constant surveillance. One of my sisters (42) was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer a year ago. Â My other sister (46) has masses in her uterus (nonmalignant thus far). Also, my mother is adopted and her familial health history is unknown. I have had multiple breast lumps grow over the past 10-15 years that have been tagged and watched, biopsied, or removed. I underwent stereotactic biopsy and had 23-30 biopsy samples taken from 6 lumps at one time, only under local (thankfully negative) and those that have undergone this procedure can appreciate the anxiety and pain involved. I have undergone too numerous to count mammograms and ultrasounds almost every 6 months, with the fear that this could finally be the test showing I have the disease. Last June, 3 new lumps were found (1 in a group of a smaller clump) and it was at this point I was sent for genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2. I am BRCA negative. My younger sister is negative also. Six months later, now, my bilateral breast ultrasound is showing one of the lumps is irregularly shaped, in a clump and growing slowly. Here we go again. Two days ago my surgeon sat me down and we had a frank talk about the high risk of me eventually developing breast cancer in the future, possibly near future. Because I now have a documented family history (sister), my mother's history is unknown (being adopted - for all we know I could have 3 aunts with breast cancer) in addition to my constant fibrocystic changes I have 2 options; I can once again undergo a stereotactic biopsy under local ( no thank you) or have a skin-sparing bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction and in all likelihood save my life. My husband and I discussed the bilateral mastectomy option a year ago when my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer and again last August when in the news Angelina Jolie revealed she underwent her procedure to preserve her life through removal of her breasts. I stated to him if faced with that reality I, too, would undergo a bilateral mastectomy for prevention. His response was \"Do it\". I knew without a doubt he would be there to support me through it. The fact is, I am now facing the choice of having my diseased breast tissue removed and having immediate reconstruction and this, in all likelihood, will save my life. I don't expect others to understand why I am choosing this; it is personal and borders on self-preservation. I see on a daily basis what others have gone through after being diagnosed and treated in order to beat this terribly silent, cunning disease. \"Self-preservation is the sibling of self-care. In the same way that we need to care for ourselves we need self-protection, too. There is no point caring for ourselves if we then don't protect the very self that we have cared for.\" (http://www.self-esteem-enhances-life.com/self-preservation.html) I am choosing life and all that comes with it. I want to see my son get the job of his dreams and watch my husband walk my daughter down the aisle. I want to go the Fiji for vacation and live till I am old and have white hair. My decision for this is self-preservation and yes it is selfish, but please remember, it is MY decision, leave any judgement to the side. I don't want to endure chemotherapy because my body turned on itself, and I will be the one wearing the t-shirt that states, \"Yes they are fake - My real ones tried to kill me\" (BreastCancerWarrior.net). Rock on! Be strong!",
