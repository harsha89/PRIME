So while you should discuss it with your doctor (Which I did, and got two other opinions) be prepared that you simply may not be a candidate.  I'm also going to say as someone who had a NNSM, it wasn't as bad as everyone paints it out to be. I was worried that I would be branded a freak (I'm only 27) and have a hard time dating, etc. In the end - I  can honetly say that I don't miss my nipples, and have no plans to get new ones. But that is your choice, and you should be as educated as possible going in.",
