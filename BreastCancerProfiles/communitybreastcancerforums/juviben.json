I'm having really soft stools, too, a few times a day. Is this common? Also, what about the hair, eyelashes and eyebrows? I lost lots of hair on AC but kept my lashes and brows. What can I expect? My nurses say if I haven't lost them with the AC then I probably won't lose them at all. They also said my hair probably will start growing slowly. Is this true? I really miss my hair.
