IBC is rare - only between 1% - 5% of all DXd types of BC.\"    Your response saddened me. It appeared in a Google search when I was seeking knowledge. If responses are harsh it will inhibit women from reaching out when actually in need or newly diagnosed. It was a valid question, all welcome. Harshness and making others feel stupid for asking questions detours the very purpose of this forum.  Support and Encourage With Respect, April God be with you.   ",
