Not the same, but not so profoundly different than human medicine. Hospital and lab settings are familiar to me, but I do miss seeing cats and dogs! No doubt that in an odd way my backround has just increased my curiosity",

Afterward, I laid on a table as them made a mold of my back to lay on during treatments. There was a little drawing with a magic marker on my chest (washed off easily) and as a final step the nurse did the tattoos. Think of it as quick pin prick that they rub some ink over. Not painful...and very small. Took 25-30 minutes total.",

Everyone has their own experience, but thought I would share mine since I had the bikini cut too. I was in the hospital one night and had a morphine pump. I was catherterized as well...my doctor wanted me to be able to relax and didn't want me to have to get up to pee. (I thanked him for that later). Next morning they took out the catheter and had me up walking. I was very slightly nauseous from the morphine, but I don't remember any significant pain. Seriously, the ride home in my husband's new car was bumpy (shocks weren't very smooth), but once I got home I scrambled some eggs for dinner and watched a little TV. You get a weird feeling when you stand up that an RN friend warned me would feel like my \"\"innerds\"\" were falling out between my legs (not pain, just odd sensation). Other than that I took it relatively easy, and felt quite good in about 48 hours after coming home. Gained my energy back over the next couple of weeks.Wishing you a similar experience without complications!",

I have to believe it is just the delayed cumulative effect of the whole breast treatments. A word about cabbage leaves....they work! I am stillvery red and stinging (especially under my arm) so I bought a cabbage when I went to buy groceries last night. I used my first leaf as I was having my morning coffee this morning. First of all, it felt cool and wonderful. Secondly, it felt like it was drawing the heat out of my skin. The leaf was actually hot when I removed it. I followed up with a second leaf and then applied Miaderm. It feels much better at the very least, as cabbage leaves are effective as cold packs, but I suspect there is some other therapeutic \"plant\" value. I'm no longer a skeptic.",

The fatigue finally hit me for real right on the last day of treatment that coincided with my anniversary. I think my DH was suprised it took that long. I'm still tired in spite of getting enough sleep, but this won't last forever. You just have to be patient and try not to feel guilty. We all get back to our new normal with a little time.",
