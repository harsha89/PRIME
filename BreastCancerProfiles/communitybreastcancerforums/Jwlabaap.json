All of these could be totally random and not a cause for alarm, because they are all separate issues or are they?",

On the US in the left axillary region a lymph node was demonstrated 2.3cm x1.6cm. Impression: 1. No abnormalities noted in the region of Palpable abnormality. Correlation with clinical exam needed as this should not deter biopsy of any clinically suspicious palpable lesion. 2. 2.3 cm lymph node left axillary region My question-should this be concerning?? My GYN suggested a second look in 3months, however I am 2 hours from a major cancer center and feel that perhaps I shouldn\u2019t just \u201cwait\u201d as I would rather be proactive than reactive. Am I over reacting? Honest thoughts please! Log in to post a reply",
