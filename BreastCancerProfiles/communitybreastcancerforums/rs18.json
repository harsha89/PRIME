It's been a 6-month roller coaster ride, and I am now navigating second opinions, and checking out different surgeons to have surgery this month or next month. (Still iffy on the necessity of this surgery given the low upgrade percentages and no family history of BC.) I still have several questions. If anyone who decided to have the excisional biopsy can relay their experience: If your BS went in through your nipple, did you lose your sensation of sexual arousal in that nipple? If you are small-breasted, what physical changes do you visibly see post surgery? Did you have a choice between the SAVI SCOUT (SSL) or the wire-localization (WL) and if so, which did you choose? Any experiences with oncological surgeons in the NY area? Thank you so much. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Nov 29, 2018 07:49AM - edited Nov 29, 2018 08:51AM by rs18 Jumping in with an update to help anyone going through the whole Radial Scar confusing journey. 1. I got a second opinion with a surgeon affiliated to a different hospital. That is something that was helpful and advice I got on here. It was very useful because six months had passed by since my mammograms and biopsy, and I had a clearer head and was armed with more information to be able to ask questions that were important for me since the first time I was still in this cloud of \"what is happening?/confused/operating on emergency mode and just going through the motions. 2. Getting a second opinion pathology report. Then, I had a light bulb moment and realized I was approaching this all wrong because my hesitancy and doubt were coming from my experience with the biopsy/mammograms and those doctors and not with the surgeons. The oncologist surgeons are basing their treatment on what the pathologists/radiologists have interpreted. So, off I went to do more research and learned that you can actually get a second opinion pathology report and request your slides to be sent for that. I actually ended up picking them up and hand delivering them to a completely different facility (not affiliated to onc surgeon #1 or #2) to speed up the timing process. 3. Another ultrasound and/or mammogram. Since I was approaching six months, I asked the onc surgeon #2, \"Shouldn't I be having an us follow-up before making any decisions on surgery, especially because there was another area on my breast that said needed follow-up on my biopsy report?\" Glad I asked because no one had reached out to me about this and onc surgeon #2 said, \"Oh it's been six months? Yes, of course, that makes perfect sense.\" (You really have to be constantly your own advocate and on top of things. Frustrating.) 4. Deciding on Excisional Biopsy. I had already let six months go by so I had instinctively and unconsciously really taken a wait-and-see approach. There is really no clear cut answer on this. But, since I want to ttc next year (and may include ivf etc.), the feedback I kept getting was that it would be harder to \"follow\" me for any changes, especially if I started taking any hormones, and that the last thing I would want was to be pregnant and dealing with this uncertainty that there may be something hidden behind/around the radial scar. So, I decided to schedule the surgery. I never got a clear answer on the breast shape, disfigurement, nipple loss of sensitivity question. It is a gamble and neither surgeon wanted to say for sure anything. Most people get their sensations back, but it really depends on how your body heals, the location of incision/mass, size of mass/breast and skill of surgeon. 5. Diet to help promote healing and recovery. Off I went to do more research on diet to help my body heal better from surgery. There is a lot of information on Dr. Google that I found online (most of the info I found was related to plastic surgery, but hey, surgery is surgery). I liked this link because it mentioned herbs as well, and it had it broken down in a time line by pre-op, one week away, and post-op. I don't know the doctor and I checked that these things were on other lists, and so I used it as a guideline for myself: jonturkmd.com/procedures/nutritional-information The only thing that was mentioned to me from my doctors for the surgery were things to avoid like the Vitamin E, Omega, aspirin etc. I really wish doctors gave information on diet to promote healing, so yet again, I had to do this through my own research. I did ask a physician at the hospital if it was ok to take arnica after I went home, and was told yes. Asking right after surgery your doc about any supplements you may want to take is a good idea. 6. Seed localization. The day before surgery, I went in to get a radioactive seed implanted so that the surgeon can use it as a guide. My facility does not do wire localization anymore. I got local anaesthesia to the breast and was awake to see them insert the seed. They used an ultrasound as a guide, then I got more mammograms, and then I was sent to talk with the radiologist. I used that opportunity to again get someone else's opinion on radial scars and treatment options in general. She was the first person to tell me that my shape wouldn't change because of the size that was being taken out and she was for getting it removed. The procedure was not painful to me. The mammogram hurt more. And, I went back to work right after. I was there three hours. 7. Bras, anaesthesia, surgery and escorts. The sports bra with the zippered front was another great tip I got from here. Thank you! I went all over looking for one and if you can't wait for Amazon, I finally found them at Walmart and Target. The most painful thing I experienced was getting the needle/tube in for the twilight anaesthesia. Three different nurses and three different locations they tried. The first nurse was unsuccessful, and she was in there a long time trying to get it to work. It didn't help that I was dehydrated since no liquids after 7 a.m. It was painful. I did mention that small needles work better on me. The second nurse tried a second location and she was much better. She also lowered my bed so my head was in a more reclined position in case I got woozy. I only felt a pinch. However, when I was in the operating room, I was still wide awake so the anaesthesiologist noticed my tube was leaking when she was putting in the twilight and had to remove the tube and try again on a different arm. Didn't hurt and before I knew it, I was asleep. I definitely needed an escort to be released, and it was very helpful to have my friend there before surgery for support because there's a lot of people coming in asking you questions as well as after in the recovery room. My mind was still foggy when the surgeon came in to talk to me after, and my friend was able to remember important info that I was having a hard time remembering since I was still coming off of the anaesthesia. I had this yummy bone broth after as my first meal after being discharged. The apple juice and crackers went down well in the recovery room. And, that's it so far! My surgery was yesterday. I'm resting today. I haven't taken the strong medication they give you in case you need it. Been feeling ok. I did a little bit of icing yesterday, and I have a bottle of Tylenol at hand in case I need it. Still have bandages on. I can take them off and take a shower tomorrow. My results will come in a week. Hope this was helpful! Hugs to all.",
