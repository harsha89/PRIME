However, last week I started to develop a very itchy, bumpy rash on my chest.  My RO said it's rads-induced folliculitis.  I have been prescribed a regimen of 3x daily washing of the area with diluted Hibiclens + a mild steroid cream (can't remember the name right now) twice daily.  RO and nurse looked at it again today, because it was driving me crazy over the weekend.  I will admit I have not been good at using the wash and cream more than once daily.  RO also suggested I use a cold washcloth compress over the area after the Hibiclens and before the steroid cream to help calm things down.  I'm trying to leave it alone, but believe me, I'm fantasizing about rubbing a rough, dry washcloth over the area!  (Of course I won't ... but still! ...) I just hope this area calms down soon, otherwise it's going to be a long and uncomfortable three weeks ahead.",

Sometimes I have to compromise by rubbing the area. I know I should leave it alone but it's nearly impossible at times. My RO said it's folliculitis from the rads. I was given a chlorhexedine wash to use thrice daily (this kills yeast and bacteria that can cause itchiness) plus a mild rx steroid ointment. Kind of helps but not completely. Hopefully you'll respond better! Also for relief from the heat and itchiness, a cold wet washcloth compress on the chest is helpful. Don't use anything as strong as ice; I just keep rinsing the cloth to keep it cold. Hope you feel better soon!",

I almost had to check the URL to make sure I wasn't reading The Onion. :-) I'm not going to defend People magazine, but I think this statement is entirely wrong: \"But the smoking gun is the fact that Angelina Jolie's seemingly spontaneous announcement magically appeared on the cover of People Magazine this week -- a magazine that is usually finalized for publication three weeks before it appears on newsstands.\" So by that logic, tragic events like hurricanes, tornadoes, mass shootings, (not to mention celebrity breakups!) must also have been presaged three weeks prior to publication? Phew, so glad to have that clarified, because I've always marveled at the People mag covers in the supermarket checkout lines that feature events that happened just days ago. ;-)",

Uneventful until the end when she told me my next mammogram will be in November, which will be a year after the mammo that led to the diagnosis. Six month later (May of 2014) I'll have an MRI. She said I'll be checked every six months, alternating mammo with MRI. I could swear, however, that she told me when I met with her in January that my next mammo would be this June. She said today that that wouldn't be true, since it's too soon after rads. Since all three docs are at the same hospital, I paid the RO nurse a quick visit and left word with her to check with the RO. I know I didn't dream this ... One of the three docs said I'll have a mammo in June (of this year) and MRI in December. The thought of waiting till November makes me a little uneasy ... Mostly for the unaffected breast.

Did anyone w/ LX and rads have a different timeframe?",

From an emotional perspective I would rather not go in for a mammo at the same time of year of the original diagnosis. I'd rather mark that time of year with something else. The mammo happened the Monday after thanksgiving and two days after my daughter's birthday (but I had felt the lump and had seen my primary doc so I was worried during the holiday weekend). Then the biopsy was done the day before my husband's bday and dx came back hours before his bday dinner outing. I know there are guarantees. But I can't imagine the team won't agree to push it to a month or so earlier. I know insurance companies can be strict about mammos being exactly a year apart but in my case I'm going to need them every six months.",
