I still have pain at the lumpectomy site (left arm) and am 4 years 2 1/2 months out...Some days are better than others and my Dr. is not concerned, she said this is very common. I had stage 2 and 12 nodes removed. I also have a pea size cist under the right arm that can be felt easily, it fells like it has attached to muscle and pulls, something else to worry about. So many things that no one tells you and none of it is pleasant!",
