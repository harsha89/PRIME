Some background: I was diagnosed last May a few weeks before my 42nd birthday. I have IDC  in the right breast with lymph node involvement. BRCA testing was negative. I just finished neo-adjuvant chemo 2-1/2 weeks ago (4 rounds of AC, then 12 weekly Taxol/Herceptin). Still on weekly Herceptin. Post-chemo tests: MRI says near complete response. Hooray! Tons of calcifications in mammos so had a stereotactic bilateral biopsy this week. Path report came back clear - no cancer in the samples. So, good news on that front too! The dilemma: BS says that I can have a lumpectomy or mastectomy, but I am having difficulty figuring this one out. The stats seem almost even on this one (or are they???) so how do I figure out what to do? My BS did say that monitoring me is going to be complex because of the calcifications. I'll need radiation no matter what I decide because the tumor was close to my chest wall and my lymph node biospy in June came back positive. Generally, I go for the least invasive choice, but I have been really aggressive with this cancer. I want to be there for my son (he's 7). I guess that bilateral mastectomies would be the most aggressive, but I'm concerned about sensation loss and the complexity of the recovery. I'm not in love with my breasts, they've served their purpose for breastfeeding, but my marriage is pretty rocky so reconstruction would be something that I'd want to do. And reconstruction is tricky with the wild card of radiation thrown in. Ack! Then again, I'm worried about recurrence if I got a lumpectomy (I really don't want to do chemo ever again). The clock is ticking for this decision and I feel like I'm all over the map. Any and all advice would be appreciated. Thanks!!!!!

It must feel good to be officially cancer-free. Glad to know that you are happy with your choice. That's exactly what I'm hoping to feel about things after surgery. I'm spending this weekend pretending that I'm making a choice to see how it feels ;-)",

I'm terrified of a recurrence, can't face the thought of chemo again. Then again, I'm not 100% sure about bilateral mastectomies - all the reconstruction issues that women face have really troubled to me. Having a port for chemo has been my first experience of a foreign object in my body and it took quite a lot to adjust to it. Sometimes I think I should get the lumpectomy and see how I deal with the anxiety of the screenings, etc. Then, I worry that I'll never revisit the issue unless I have to (and that would be because of a recurrence). I really want to move closer to closing this chapter in my life but can't seem to fully accept the BMX route.  Still conflicted....",

Brave you are. I didn't realize about the skin healing time from the radiation before reconstruction. Good to learn about that from you.",
