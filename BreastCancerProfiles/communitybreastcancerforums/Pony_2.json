      "Content": "Mar 30, 2016 12:05AM - edited Mar 30, 2016 12:07AM by Pony_2 I had the biopsy last Thursday. Radiologist was unable to aspirate fluid so he did a core needle biopsy. Was only able to get a small amount of tissue and after two samples were taken could no longer decipher between the regular breast tissue and lesion due to \"biopsy changes\". Went for results today and surgeon said that report says blood and scant breast tissue were submitted with no diagnostic abnormalities. From what I gather there wasn't a lot to sample but what they could use showed no abnormalities. I am supposed to follow up in 6 months with another ultrasound unless I encounter changes. Surgeon was comfortable with having me wait and was pretty sure its still just a cyst. I'm relieved that I did not get \" bad\" news but not so sure this is great news either. I asked if I should have a mammo and he said not until I'm 40. I'll be 39 this year. Does anyone know how to get the gene test done? I'd like to have it. In the meantime I guess I'll wait.",

      "Content": "Pony_2 wrote: Hello! I am 38 and found small lump near my right nipple two weeks ago. Went to Gyno who couldn't really assess it and sent me to surgeon. Surgeon ordered an ultrasound. Findings are: 5mm x 2 mm x 4 mm oval low echogenic lesion which does demonstrate some some increase through transmission and sharp walls. The lesion is wider than taller. No other sonographic abnormalities are identified. Impression: there is an oval low echogenic lesion corresponding to the palpable abnormality in the 8-9 o'clock periareolar area of the right breast. This could represent a low echogenic solid lesion or possibly a complex cystic lesion. If thought clinically necessary, aspiration could be attempted either based on palpation or with ultrasound guidance. I go for ultrasound guided aspiration next Thursday. Doctor said most likely not cancer but I've read low echogenic is malignant characteristic?? But oval and wider than taller is benign characteristic?? Surgeon seemed pretty confident that all is well. Any thoughts?? Log in to post a reply",
