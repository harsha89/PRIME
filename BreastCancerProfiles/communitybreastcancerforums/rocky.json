I found my lump in Oct. 07 but waited to go to the doctor because my husband was taking me on a trip to Holland. Due to the holidays I wasn't able to have my surgery until Jan. We kept it a secret from my children and father until after Christmas which was very hard. I know how your feeling right now. My oncologist found a very enlarged lymph node on the cancer side a few months ago so he out me on antibiotics hoping it was an infection. Well it didn't change. He wants it out because even though my PET Scan didn't pick it up as cancer he said there is a slight chance of a false negative. I'll find out tomorrow when my surgery will be. Most of us on here know how it is to not sleep. I don't really like to take medicine but you get to the point where you just have to give in and take some anyway. My onc described a very mild dose of Ativan and it helps. So maybe you could ask your doctor for something. My advice is to surround yourself with family and friends who truly love you it will make a world of difference. I find talking to my best friend a little easier then my husband. She's worried about me but he is the person who I vowed to share my life with and he is just as petrified as I am. THINK POSITIVE!!!! I will keep you in my prayers for your results to be B9.",
