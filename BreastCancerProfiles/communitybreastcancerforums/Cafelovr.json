For me, it's just the wear and tear of the chemo and meds I take (hello anti-hormonals!!). See if you can get a Rx for Voltaren Gel. Used on a regular basis, it does help. Tramadol, Oxy, Hydro doesn't touch it. Pain patches work good as well, but not as good as the gel... It sounds like you need a really good orthopedist!

My heart breaks to see them go. For the first year in my 38 years of life, we didn't cook. We had the grocery store cater it. It was good, but it wasn't our tradition. I did make stuffed mushrooms & baked a cake. At least we are all together. That's the important part. I too dread my second treatment!! It took me 5 days of constipation before things got \"moving\". I'm still sore! I think I sat on the potty from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. I know, probably TMI, but I'm sure you all understand. My onc told me 3 Colase 2x/day and start Miralax the morning of chemo. We did talk about my lack of sleep. Instead of lowering my steroids, he's adding Ativan (?) to my pre chemo cocktail and adding Xanax w/ my nausea meds for 72 hrs. Hopefully I can handle the SE if I have enough sleep. If I have chemo on Tuesday, what is Thursday & Friday...day 3 & 4? Those are the worst!! Heart palpatations, dillusions (being tired) and aching EVERYWHERE! The doc did say to go back to the gym...that that would actually help rebound me better. Psalm121...I agree with you 100%. Everything is just so magnified and intesified! On a good note, foods tasted good and actually indulged in a really good cheesburger at FiveGuys...they just opened one up down the road from me...That's all I need isn't it LOL. On a serious note, I know this is hard, and at our lowest we say we can't do it. I know I did. But you know what? We can, and we must. This sh&* is saving our lives. It beats being dead...it beats my little girl growing up without a mother...it beats an empty seat at the dinner table during the holidays! I love you all and you are not alone!!!!!!!!",

I work at a community college here and was asking one of the nurses in our Health Div., who is a BC survivor, that if I did have recon, what was stopping cancer from reoccuring in the new breast.

What used to look like a solid mass now looks like swiss cheese. There are holes where the chemo has penetrated it. It was kind of depressing, knowing that the tumor wasn't shrinking. In my head I had this vision of being cancer free. I do have 12 more weeks of chemo to endure, so hopefully that will do some more damage to the site. Just so it blasts away the spot on my liver.

The onc is afraid the neuropathy will be permanent and get worse. It's only in my hands, and not in my feet. I've had 7 Taxols and 9 Herceptins.

It looks like I may be heading to surgery sooner than expected. (Yikes!!) If the single liver met is gone, then it's just the BMX. If it's still there, they'll do something call ablation where they burn it out...Ewwwww! I am so scared to go off chemo! I feel like I'm losing my safety net. She did say I got 75% of the benefit from Taxol and that they will take good care of me! I love my onc team!!!! Keep your fingers crossed and say your prayers.

Does anyone get a feeling like a string is wrapped against their legs? Like a funny sensation of something wrapped around them? It's confusing...one minute I'm off Taxol, then I get it...are they waiting for the surgeon??? I'll find out on Tuesday when I meet him and Wed when I see my onc.

The way it was explained to me was that they take muscle (if needed) and arteries are internally re-routed up to the breast. They don't need to be cut. If there is not enough fat to form the mold, they can lipo the hips and tushy to make a decent size breast. Which is good for me...I carry my weight in my stomach and hips. I'm a 32G or a 34DDD.

Had my last regular rads tx today. 5 boosts ahead of me and then I'm done. For me, radiation was so much harder than chemo.",

Alicia, good luck with everything! Sending great thoughts your way. I had number 17 today with rads. Skin is just starting to turn brown. I'm getting a little rash and little bumps on my chest. Buggers itch like crazy, so I'm lubing up like there's no tomorrow! 11 more to go. I'm ready to be done. This is so tiring! I find myself more weepy than normal and always feeling on edge. Oh well, focus Linda...this soon will be done! Other than being tired, my ribs and muscles hurt in my arms from keeping them above my head. Someone told me rads lasted for about 15 minutes. Not me...30-40 minutes depending on if they do x-rays or bolus. I'm still working full time and getting ready to start Tamoxifen in mid July. I'm trying for a July 4 long weekend trip to FL.

This is probably too much information, but I also was allowed to take vaginal estrogen. Without divulging too much, I need it. I'm allowed to take it as long as I take my Tamoxifen.

I thought I'd have to take it for life, but there's no sight of cancer anywhere. My liver is clear. My next MRI is in Sept. He told me I was going to grow into an old woman.

I've got a great dr and I've had a great response to meds. It all depends on the type of breast cancer you have. Prior to 1998, my cancer would have been a death sentence. With the dvmt of Herceptin, women with Her2+ cancer are living longer and healthier lives. If you want to see a powerful movie, watch Living Proof with Harry Conick Jr. It's about the dr. who developed Herceptin.

It's supposed to rain all week, but at least Katia isn't supposed to make landfall anywhere.",

I am waiting for spring so I can have my recon...what is up with us and spring!! :) I had my neurologist appt today who confirmed RIBP. I go tomorrow for a nerve conduction test and an EMG. I guess it's pretty unpleasant. Shoot, the dr said it's painful. Oh well, I've been through a lot; what's a little more grief. They gave me a Lidocaine patches for the pain and a medicine that Parkinson's patients take to control the tremors. Don't worry, I DO NOT HAVE PARKINSON'S!! ...I can do this!

Not sure about that one. I need to tell you all something, but PLEASE DO NOT SAY ANYTHING ON FACEBOOK...My sister had a bilateral mastectomy last week. They found \"something\"...aka Dysplasia. They told her to start on a 5 yr Tamoxifen plan, but she chose to be extremely radical and have the BMX. She didn't want to run the risk of something worse. I don't blame her!! So both me and my mom are Stage IV and my sis is stage 0. And we are all BRCA -. The reason I ask not to post anything is that my mom doesn't know, and neither of us have any plans to tell her. She would go over the edge since we live in NC and my sis lives in FL. My mom is struggling to go through this. She is suffering from severe depression because of the issues with her heart and lungs. She blames herself for my cancer and learning that sis has \"something\" would be too much for her. My sister will have expanders put in 6 wks from now. Her skin is very thin, and the PS is actually using pig skin as the flap. I have never heard of such a thing. I told her that I hoped my Bro in Law likes bacon (I love my BIL) They've been married for 24 years...since I was 17. The one thing that kind of hurt was that my sis didn't tell me until after her surgery. She's went through this for about a year before telling me. She said she didn't want me to stress, that I was too busy taking care of our mom. She told me that I had to be strong for us all. I guess she's had a lot of complications from the surgery. She needs to get her butt up here to my onc! She sounds so weak...",

I heard a cute saying: When I have three hairs on my head, I'll braid it; when I have two hairs on my head, I'll wear pigtails; when I have one hair on my head, I'll put in a ponytail. When I have no hair left, I'll thank God that I don't have to do my hair today! I just thought that was cute! And as far as the DHs go...be lucky you're getting some. I'm itching for some attention Tim thinks he's going to hurt me I guess. He'll happily do housework, homework, and errand running, but is afraid I'm made of china and will break. I just need him to throw me up against a wall and have his way with me! Ahhhhhhh",

I'll be sure to tell my DH about dusting though!  I know I used to love hot tea since I couldn't drink coffee anymore (GAG). It gives me the worst heartburn anymore. That is definitely something new. The Adriamycin still gives me a flushed appearance on my face, arms, and trunk. They don't bring my drugs out at one time. First they bring the pre chemo drugs (Decodron-sp) and Zofran. I get my shot of Ativan first and they set me up for a 1/2 hr drip. While thats dripping, they go get my Adriamycin ready. When I start beeping, they come in with the two horse tubes of Red Devil and give that to me over a 15-30 min process. When that's over, they leave and mix the Cytoxin and give that to me right away for 45 min (see if I can't bump it to an hour). Then I have to wait about another 1/2 to finish the saline drip. All in all I'm there for about 2 1/2 hours. They flush the port and I'm on my way. I actually didn't lose any hair this time when I took my shower. I have \"tufts\" of hair everywhere on my head. I didn't lose any hair except for on my head and pubic hair. Melinda, I have the porcupine look. Alicia, This is it for the AC!? I raise a glass of champagne to you! Number 3 is coming on Tuesday for me, and I dread it. Here comes the THZ (Zometa & Taxol) My onc says it's a cakewalk compared to the AC. We'll see...One thing at a time. Love to all!",

I can't stand to pee cause the smell makes me gag. My head won't stop throbbing, but at least I'm sleeping ok. Got my new schedule. I had an echo on the 31st. I go for a breast MRI on Monday, see the dr on Tuesday and start my next round of chemo on Jan 13. TH*12. Have to see my dentist in February and then start Zometa for my bones. Got kind of bummed when I found out that I'll be taking that for years. He said I start 1 every 2 months...1 every 3 months...1 every 6 months and on and on and on. I guess I just need to treat this like a chronic disease, but I didn't expect this. I'm getting overwhelmed!!!!! This wasn't what I had planned. The one bright side to everything is that the dr. said my tumor has shrunk by a third! I've never heard of a port flipping. My surgeon told me that she tacked mine down onto the pec muscle. She said it shouldn't move. My weight has been fluctuating like crazy. One week I lose 6 lbs, the next I gain 5 lbs. I stay right around where I was pre cancer. It's too cold to do anything.

I started my period. Onc said I wouldn't have anymore and can't believe I wasn't having hot flashes. I called the on-call dr. He had no answer for me other than to tell me to be careful if my counts are too low, I could bleed out! What?! He said to have my gyno on speed dial and call my Onc on Monday. WTF! Some advice! Luckily, it's heavy, but not THAT heavy. So during my good week I get bogged down with cramps and moodiness. Maybe that's why I keep crying. Hmmmmm...I also get the worst heartburn anymore. Ugh.  Love to all! Linda, I hope you feel better! Ensure is really good to drink as well as Carnation Instant Breakfast.

I also am eligible for SSDI, but not yet. If the cancer goes somewhere else, than probably yes, I would do it. I want to stay as normal as possible.

The office girls thought I was having another mood change...AKA hot flashes. And I have become the farting queen. I can out fart my 11 year old nephew! How's that for being cool... Mouse: I understand almost being done that you wanted to stay away from antidepressents. I however just finished #3 of 12 tx of TH. My ovaries got shut down, I'm having hot flashes, and everything makes me cry. Everything is a calamity. I'm usually so cheerful and upbeat. This is not like me. I don't have a gloom and doom feeling, I'm not depressed, just things make me sad. It's like being pregnant again! So I will be taking an antidepressent through the end of treatment to March. My fight or flight and become cry and flight. I've lost my coping mechanism. And I know I can't do this without help. Which brings me to dear, sweet Melinda. Thank you for making me laugh so hard! I finally figured why I pee down my leg. I feel like a friggin dachsund. My pee goes to the right, and it's hard to clean yourself off with just TP. I've got the wet wipes that clean too. I was at home, peed, and it ran down my leg and soaked my pajama bottoms. So I've learned to strip it down to take a whiz. What joy in life! Sherri: I'm not sure of Arimidex. I know it's for ER+ only women...leaves me out, but my mom to Tamoxifen for 5 years. Do some research online. Kimmie: I am in the same boat as you are. I can't afford this crap! I was awarded a $1000 grant through a partner of Susan G. Komen. Does your cancer center have a breast coordinator? Talk to them or talk to the billing department. It doesn't pay for medical bills, but they will pay $1000 towards my car, or phone, utilities, etc. At least I can get one bill paid. And call the bill collectors to set up payment plans. Even if it's $10, it will keep you out of collection. Good luck, and I know this is hard!!! Becca: You get an extra huge bear hug for me! Love to all! (Hugs)",

I'll take it weekly for 12 weeks and then go to every 3 weeks for the rest of the year. There is another drug for Her2+ called Tykerb. I'm not too aware of this drug. I'm not sure if this is used if Herceptin fails or what. I do know it's for advanced metastatic cancers. My onc said it was a good thing that I was Her2+++. He said we have one more line of defense against BC. As far as Taxol goes, my biggest complaint is being so darned tired all of the time. I have no energy to do anything, I don't sleep very well, and my legs just ache. The dr. said I need to be exercizing, but how do you do that when you don't have the energy to get off the couch?",

Everything from the middle of my right breast going to my left armpit is being radiated, including sternum and collarbone (sub-clavicular lymph nodes). The heart and esophagus are in the way and receive a little radiation. Google radiation to the left breast, and you'll find info on possible heart radiation. The Rads Onc told me that I could get pretty bad heartburn and to avoid spicy foods. Luckily, I've had no heartburn and enjoy my wings and beer! The only thing that I can't kick is the hiccups that I get EVERY time I eat. I guess that's a rare side effect from the chemo. It affects the flap from the esophagus to the stomach. It may go away, and it may not. It doesn't hurt, but it's a pain in the neck.",

My onc thinks the sternum area is just uptake from a car accident I had in Feb 09. My car was totaled, foot broken, and chest severely bruised from the seat belt. The uptake, however, showed up on the Bone Scan, but not on the PET/CT. Because of this, he listed me as possible sternum mets in order to give me Zometa to keep the cancer out of my bones. As of now, I am NED and finished w/ all treatment except my naked Herceptin and Zometa, which I will take for life. It's interesting. I brought up the subject of Stage IV sub-categories to the rads onc instead of lumping all forms into a single category. Stage 4a for a single met to a single area (me), Stage 4b to multiple mets to a single area...and so on. She said the ACS is looking into this. I guess I just need something to hold onto...",

They're the ones who held me when I was sick, and cheered when I felt good. I'm so lucky to have a sister and her family who drove 11 hours to be with me when I had my surgery and cooked all my fav foods. And last, but certainly not least, it's brought you, my dear sisters, into my life to know that you don't have to know someone in person to love them. God Bless, Warriors!!

Another thing that can screw the heart up is if you had radiation on the left breast/chest wall. I did, and my cardiologist says that more than likely, I will have congestive heart failure when I'm older because it's almost a given that your heart and lung is hit during the rads.

Dr. said that was normal, and it was because of the muscle used from my back. Oh well. I think I need a little \"tweaking\". I also did my hair. I am now a blond.

I love mine too, but I've heard horror stories. They do the A part very slow as they can make sure it's going into the port and not into your blood stream. Did your nurse draw out a little blood to make sure? Mine did. I really didn't have a problem with nausea. My biggest thing was when the Cytoxin hit. My nose and sinuses really bothered me when it started coming. Last night I got a headache. Not painful, but just bothersome. And my legs and hips are aching like I've run a marathon. I go for my Neulasta shot at 4:45 today. Then I'm going to bed :) And chemo brain kicked in for me the day I was dx...Ha Ha. ccnani: You are not leaving this group.

He was kinda doggin' the hospital here, saying that they won't give him the help he needs. He's frustrated with BC rates going up... He did say I could go over and have it done in Wake Forest if I had my heart set on using abs. But he can do this...lat flap with tissue expanders in the cancerous breast and tissue expanders in the non-cancerous breast. It would be a 4-hour surgery and a 3-day stay in the hospital. I'm waiting for my appt. time. So I will have implants. Alicia, I know you had expanders...help!! Why do I plan when I know things are going to get screwed up!

However, further testing showed metastisis in her bone. My mom has had a recurrence of breast cancer which is scattered throughout her bone. It's in every rib, sternum, pelvis, sacrum, humerus...the list goes on. How the woman coped with everyday life, I don't know. She is in so much pain. Add on top of that COPD and emphysema; she's hurting. The good news is that she hasn't had a cigarette since before Thanksgiving. I honestly thought I was going to lose her. She was in ICU on a breathing machine for 3 days. I was lucky enough to get her my oncologist, who is about the most amazing man on earth.   God love him, and he said she will be OK. My mom has done everything for me the past two years. So much that she neglected her own health. I am scared!!!!!! I am so lost. I know how to fight, but I can't make her fight. She is so down.

I'm still on my HERP break. I have scans and MUGA November 5 and onc will decide if I can go back onto chemo. I go Oct 11 to have a consult to remove my ovaries. Ahhh, it will never end :) It seems in the back of my mind that I'm always looking over my shoulder. My onc still maintains that I have an excellent prognosis. One stupid thing I did was to throw out my back. Stupid me did fire extinguisher training and stayed down too low too long. I can barely move, but gotta love Vicadin, Flexeril, and Prednisone! Only me... My mom is doing semi OK. Her cancer is stable, although she had an oral cancer scare. However, it turned out to be a reaction to Zometa, so she's taken a break. She still has the COPD & Emphysema, so she has good days and then very bad days. On October 29, I am due to be a first time homeowner! It always took me a while to commit to a house in NC, because I always wanted to go back to my beloved Florida. However, I can't leave my doctors, my job, and I have to admit...I love the season changes here. I found the perfect house in the adjoining High Point area. It has plenty of room for my hubby and mom to get along, and Libby to grow up! Well, I will end this jibber jabber...LOL Remember one thing: you all are so dear to me. I could not do this without you! You guys understand everything I say without judgement or condemation. I can say things here that I can't say anywhere else.

I don't know if it's the Herp or the radiation to the left side of my breast. I'm going to a cardiologist who specializes with Herp women. Ahhhh, and the beat goes on (Too taboo?)

I have AC 1x every two weeks for 8 weeks (2 months) and then TH (Taxol) 1x a week for 12 weeks (3 months). It's considered neoadjuvant.

Maybe I am in denial, pretending I don't have cancer because I don't FEEL like I have cancer. I feel wonderful, but I was dx stage IV from the beginning after a sharp pain in my armpit. Bam...one stupid 2 mm spot on my liver. I lurk into these boards, but rarely post. I find everyone so inspiring that I felt the need to say something. But it breaks my heart to hear of another brave woman losing her life to this beast. It breaks my heart to read stories like Olga's battle. Or that it's moved to the brain, or the lungs, or wherever. It breaks my heart where people say they'd rather have it in the bone than in the liver, etc. Is one place better than the other???!!! Sometimes I don't get it...like we get to choose our poison!

The goal was to always move back to Florida, as that is where I'm originally from. After I got sick and was blessed with an awesome oncologist, I became NED and tried to move back. Then my mom was also diagnosed Stage IV, and I knew that NC was to be my forever home. I love the seasons here and am ready for autumn. I have to admit though...I miss Disney and Universal! 2 How did you meet your DH and why do you call him your comedy routine?  Tim was my boss. We both worked in a hotel. He was on the operations side and I was on the sales side. Once we knew we had found our soul mate, I had to find another job. We've been together for 14 years next month, married for 13. I truly believe in love at first sight. When I got sick, he would make me laugh during my chemos. When I was at my lowest, he'd do impressions and silly stuff like that. He has always made me feel beautiful and like a queen. 3 Tell me about your daughter Libby, what is she like and how is she dealing with your dx? Ah, my little Libby Lu. She is my saving grace. The lowest point of my illness was around Thanksgiving, and she watched Nick Jr. One of the little characters asked what you were most thankful for, and she came and sat in my lap, patted my cheek, and told me she was thankful for me. My heart broke, because I thought I had one foot in the grave, because I had just been diagnosed Stage IV. That was almost 5 years ago! Now she\u2019s a hormonal, temperamental, tween\u2026LOLI enjoy and thank God for the opportunity to watch her grow up! 4 Your Mom and other family members; do they live close to you? My mom and I are very close. She actually lives with me and my family. She was a plethora of information when I was diagnosed. She is close to all my chemo sisters\u2026they all call her Yaya. I love the closeness that she and my daughter share. I was close like that to my grandmother. My mom was diagnosed Stage IV almost three years ago. I was able to get her my oncologist, and the decision was made to stay in NC. My sister and her family still live in FL, so I go several times a year. She had a cancer scare a few years ago and opted for a BMX. My maternal aunt and I are very close. She has had lung and peritoneal cancer. She is seeing a surgeon on Monday for a lump found against the breast muscle. Prayers are appreciated! 5 What do you know about Love?(maybe a strange question but I would love to hear your answer) What does anyone know about Love? Is it an emotion? Is it cosmic? Can you fall in and out of love in a heartbeat? I don\u2019t know. I knew the second I met my husband that he was the man I would spend the rest of my life with. I know the earth moved for me when they put my daughter on my chest after she was born. My heart nearly exploded with love. I think the word \u201clove\u201d is often overused. I love my friends, but would I walkover broken glass to get to them like I would for my child? I don\u2019t know. Tome, actions speak louder than words. I\u2019ve lost friends who \u201cloved\u201d me because they didn\u2019t know how to talk to me or act around me after I was diagnosed. Then again, I\u2019ve had strangers climb out of the woodwork to ask what they could do. I feel loved at church; I feel loved at home. Karin, what part of FL are you at? ",

At first, it was only an oophorectomy suggested, but Tamoxifen scarred up my uterus something fierce! So they decided to take it all. Even though ovaries do produce estrogen, you have aromatase enzymes that mimic estrogen... Aromatase, also called estrogen synthetase or estrogen synthase, is an enzyme responsible for a key step in the biosynthesis of estrogens. It is a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (EC 1.14.14.1), which are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in steroidogenesis. In particular, aromatase is responsible for the aromatization of androgens into estrogens. The aromatase enzyme can be found in many tissues including gonads, brain, adipose tissue, placenta, blood vessels, skin, and bone, as well as in tissue of endometriosis, uterine fibroids, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer.[citation needed] It is an important factor in sexual development. The AIs shut these little buggers down, but they do have some wicked side effects. My onc said I was doing so good on Tamoxifen, he has left me on it. I think I'm starting my 3rd year of it... Good luck. It's not all that bad. I do not miss having a period at all!",

Because of the Tamoxifen, I take a baby aspirin daily to ward off clots and instead of just having an oophorectomy, they did a complete hysterectomy and took everything as the Tamoxifen was scarring my uterus. I will be taking that for life, unless he switches me to an AI since I'm post-menopausal. He won't stop my Herp, but he will eventually cut back on my Zometa. Right now, I have it every 3 months. He will cut it back to every 6 months at some point. We talked about stopping the Herp so I don't become immune to it, but he says not to rock the boat yet. This was my first scan in 3 years. All my markers and blood work were good in the past. I just happened to see another dr. while my regular onc was at a conference. He's the one that ordered the PET. Congrats on being NED!!! Terri, Yes, we did meet last year at the conference! Nothing really has changed! Still working full time. The only difference is that I went back to school full time. That's why I don't get on here very often...too busy with my nose buried in textbooks and taking care of my DH and DD. How are you doing? IM me! Thanks for the happy thoughts and prayers! Linda",

If I don't sit and get poisoned every three weeks, then my husband is a widower and my daughter will be an 11-year old without a mother. I'm not brave and I'm certainly not courageous. I get creeped out when people tell me I'm their hero or idol. I kind of like the term \"warrior\". Even though we will someday lose the battle, we are willing to fight. It may be next year, it may be 20 years down the road. That's life. I've earned every scar on my body from my battles. I wear them with pride. I didn't enter this lifestyle by choice, but I will march on and live out the plans that God has for me. Has anyone mentioned the term metavivior?

      "Content": "Sep 23, 2010 12:53PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:48AM by Cafelovr I am Stage IV with liver mets and am currently NED since May. Adriamycin/Cytoxin shrunk my liver tumor from 16 mm to 6 mm. Taxol/Herceptin blew it out of the water. I know you can't take Herceptin, but chemo is doable. Looking back, it seems a lifetime ago, and that there were no side effects. Of course I did, but in hind sight, it wasn't too bad. With AC, food tasted horrible. I was jacked up on steroids (Xanax counteracted that), I lost my hair, and just felt icky. I had treatment on Tuesday, and the SE hit on Thursday. By Saturday, I was feeling better. I never got sick from the treatment (Compazine and Zofran counteracted nausea). I am editing this because I forgot to mention the Neulasta shot. It's a shot after each AC treatment to pump up your WBC. This shot made me hurt and ache, because it forces the bone to create more marrow, where WBC are created. But the pain subsided by the next day. For me, this was the worst part! With Taxol, I had neuropathy. I was actually pulled off after my 9/12 treatment and sent for surgery. That was in April. After sugery, scans, and poking and prodding, I was declared NED. As soon as treatment ended, feeling came back in my hands and feet. The most important thing that I can tell you is that if you do have a negative side effect, tell your doctor. There are so many wonderful meds to counteract the steroids!!!!! I will say that I maintained a full time job through chemo, and didn't miss any work. I wish you luck, and let me know if I can do anything for you other than to send (((HUGS)))!",

Everything hurt. Couldn't sleep, became a beotch. I got scans between each chemo regimen. After A/C, the tumors looked like \"Swiss cheese\". Onc's words, not mine...LOL. After 9 Taxols/Herceptin, I had intense neuropathy. I ended Taxol and was scanned. Tumors looked deflated and \"shot up\". and went into surgery in April, but I continued Herceptin. After I healed from BMX, I was scanned prior to starting radiation. I was NED. I believe it was the Herceptin that did it for me. I still go every three weeks. I have a high risk cardiologist, follow a low sodium diet and try to stay active (yeah, right!). I get echos every two months. I take prophylactic BP medicine, and I will take a water pill if I eat anything too salty. I also take Tamoxifen and had a complete hysterectomy (name it, they took it!) I am very blessed and lucky to have such a wonderful oncologist who saw Stage IV and didn't let me cry. I was having one of those pity parties, and told him all I wanted to do is see my DD graduate HS. He said I would see my grandchildren graduate. He said he would treat me the same way even if I was Stage III. (My breast tumor was 11+ cm.) Faith has gotten me through a lot of things. Friends and family are irreplaceable. My cancer was so aggressive. I went from having two cysts drained and a mammogram/ultrasound in December, which didn't show anything, to having pain under my arm the following August. I was dx. Stage IV w/ an 11 cm tumor the following October. I have had a \"complete pathological response\" to treatment.",

That's why when one does reconstruction, a \"flap\" surgery is done. I had a lat flap in July. They removed the back muscle and created a pocket under the breast to place a tissue expander. They cut out the burnt tissue and replaced it with healthy skin from my back. On the other side, they just placed the expander. I have my exchange surgery next month. I don't know if it will ever feel \"normal\". This is our new normal. You get used to it though! Is your range of movement at least gotten better?",

I wish I could spare her of this. She started the Zometa along with the Taxol. Not sure how long she will be on the Taxol, though. She does it two weeks on and two weeks off. She has a lot of bone pain. I'm thinking that's the chemo attacking the tumors? Any ideas? I need to get her out of the house and moving around. Sitting around the house can't be helping! One bit of good news. She hasn't smoked since before Thanksgiving, and her breathing is a lot better! She craves a cigarette everyday, and I think that adds to her depression.

The drs think she has congestive heart failure. She's loaded with fluid, although none showed up on the chest xray. Does that make sense? The hospital physician thinks that the fluid they give to her during chemo is too much. So they have jacked her up with Lasix and a beta blocker. Sheesh, it seems we get one thing under control and something else happens.",

I had a clear mammogram in Dec 2008, and dx Stage IV in Oct 2009. I know mine was spreading like wildfire. Sometimes I don't know how to answer when people say at least they caught it in time. I know I'm asymptomatic, but I still have Stage IV cancer, even though it can't be seen and it didn't spread to multiple parts of my body. Tumor markers hover in the mid to upper 20s.",
