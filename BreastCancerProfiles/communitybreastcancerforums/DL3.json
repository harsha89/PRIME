I have CT scan every 3 to 4 months. as long as stable and or better.... i think onc will go with ct every 4 months EDIT:the echo...wand... always bothers me... I really dont care for that test. the techs push that wand in too hard. had my last one couple weeks ago, and I had additional breast reconstruction 7 weeks prior.... told tech if you push too hard... I might have to let you know your pushing on me too hard in the sternum area as i was still tender. but this tech did a really good job this time.",

I have lung mets. 2 they are approx 8mm and 3 mm. 2 CT'scans/1 PET scan different radiologists and 2 different measurements on the size which the size differs approx 2 mm (my onc said radiolgists can measure different so it can be off a little bit) .. i have not had a biopsy as they are not in a location that can get in too. so ... i am not 100% certain they are cancer. but not sure I want to risk not being on kadcyla and if they are cancer, they grow.  my labs today showed my AST went down teeny bit i mean teeny lol from 51 to 49 which is above normal (14-36) all my other numbers were normal. doc says still thinks from kadcyla. i kept thinking back to a couple of you that had answered my quetion couple months ago about the liver enzyme numbers and couple of you said you had high numbers or that it changed. i also reread today on kadcyla that it can cause liver damage so .. as doc said today... we will keep eye on it. if it triples then we change things around. we have a preplan of sorts. doc did ck my fingernails today... i didnt question him when he did so... just . thought oh okay showed him my nails wasnt til on way home i thought ..what the heck.. so I googled ... our nails can show changes to them if your liver is damaged or diseased. my nails look good well .... dont show signs of liver damage... bu you can see i worked in the yard yesterday and pulled old stems and flower and weeds trying to clean up the flower beds so had couple uneven nails. Denny123 I know you are a longtime Kadcyla ... how have your numbers for liver enzymes been, if you dont mind that I ask,. if you prefer not to answer I respect and understand that. Thank you for any replies to this post regarding what/where are your mets. and keep me updated as i will you on the liver enzyme numbers. Hugs~",

All is good/ stable. i did have 2mm growth however oncologist said may not really even be growth could be in measurement . so continue on with kadcyla. I believe tomorrow will be #20 for me. I was so worked up to walk in and get CT results. I almost get nauseous. wish I wasnt like that. my onc and I have discussed my next game plan would be tykerb (when needed and I Pray that wont be for very long while) maybe add herceptin to tykerb. he said he wouldnt want to put me on tykerb and xeloda at same time until/unless necessary ... we would only start out with one drug. I know there is a new drug in trial for HER2+ gals which is what I am )... probably wont see it til next year 2018 ... DS-8201 it will be the next drug after kadcyla fails. supposed to be a \"super\" kadcyla. showing remarkable results as they say. hoping I remain on kadcyla tho for a long while yet ...as I do for you ladies. My Onc has not recommended flu shot ...yet but my GP has discussed it...suggesting it. I have never had a flu shot in my life.",

I usually jump out of bed and walk best i can it off. I do take a potassium suppliment everyday since it started. Yes my potassium is ALWAYS on low side ...I really must get more water in me. Before my diagnosis, I was viligant on drinking water, now...it is like i just dont. I am terrible and I think not drinking water is causing some of this. :( I get bloodwork every 3 weeks. on monday morning labs then see onc hour later then I have to drive back to center next day for kadcyla. it stinks, they use to let us get our infusion same day then about 9 mos ago they changed it to where you have to come back next day. my oncologist said it was an insurance issue with insurance companies they were having not wanting to pay him . mine was never a problem but guess other insurance was giving hard time he said. as mentioned in previous post of mine i switch oncologists and centers in January hoping my new onc gets it all done in one morning, rather than this 2 morning every 3 weeks appointments. which brings me to ask... dont all you ladies get labs prior to each infusion? do you see your oncologist every 3 weeks after labs and before your kadcyla infusion? Hope you ladies are all doing well. Hugs~ ",

I have 3 reasons we can go off kadcyla 1. it quit working 2. my heart cant do anymore kadcyla (my heart is doing great!) 3. i decide to go off on a vaca for couple months come back and say hey doc.... i want to contintue this holiday from kadcyla... so this would be a choice of mine.... he said I can do that... and we would scan regularly and if needed go back on kadcyla. i am staying on kadcyla for now. i have pushed back infusions oh i think 3 times but only for a week or so.  CJRT.... so glad to read you too are doing so well on kadcyla... march 2013! i am sorry of the nose bleeds.  ",

I never experienced it before kadcyla so I attribute it to kadcyla.

In the 17 months since found 2 nodules on ct scan it has now grown from 4 mm to 20 mm. so it has doubled in size in 17 months I know this is still very small less than 3/4\" however we dont want to keep staying on kadcyla and it keep growing. so.... gonna see if insurance will approve me to go back on herceptin and prejetta. if no go... I will go on herceptin and doc says the lowest dose of xeloda. I am so very grateful that I have NO new nodules and that my 2 nodules are small and caught what I think are early. hate to leave kadcyla as the SE's have been very tolerable but I also even as small growth as it is dont want to risk this cancer to keep growing if we can take action and stop that get me stable. either way perjetta or xeloda... gonna be some diarhea (sp) eeek. I will continue to stop in here who knows I may be back. Denny... girl... might be seeing you soon on the xeloda board. wishing you all the very very best.",

I didnt ask what she was on now... wish I had of. my husband said he thought the dr meant she is still on kadcyla for 7.5 years. My new Onc is Indian heritage.

I dont have a port. mine was taken out during breast reconstruction. then we found the 2 teeny nodules during PET/CT scan so I do iv thru am. my arm is tired of this lol  Denny123 I think i read somewhere you are Her2+ gal? are any of you other ladies Her2+ ?

I now get both when I have my scans ordered. my last scan was after 3 kadcyla's Spoke with Onc today and he said since I am doing well with few SE's we will wait to do next scan rather than after my 6th kadcyla but after my 7th. so ... it was 3 months now 4 months. Hello wleeky1952, It is nice to meet you and Thank you for your reply! does your Onc have a CT scan for you every 3 or 4 months? Unless a pain arises or a symptom that is of concern.. for now... we are keeping my PET at a one time a year. ",

Will you see your Onc every 3 weeks as well as get blood drawn every 3 weeks? I was up and down with my weight when on hard chemo initially in 2015 (TCHP) but it has been slowly creeping up on me that I am now 18 lbs more than before diagnosis. uughh. I worked out like crazy. Avid zumba and boot camp gal... worked out daily . however in last year.... I have lost all desire. I have got to find that desire again ... my glucose has risen slightly.. think I am eating too many sweets and carbs :(  I am back to my original oncologist a glitch in the new insurance .... when I looked online it doesnt show my Doctor or center. so I called again nope he isnt in system so in meantime my oncology office called asking what new insurance do i have so they can call... sure enough my onc is in my new insurance plan i took the insurance coordinator flowers today because had it not been for her I would be at a new oncologist ... and I actually did meet with a new one last week but life has been a whirlwind this last week for me. so glad to be back with my regular onc i have had for 3 years. course ...he mentions I am ready for scan which I knew i was uuughhhh i get nervous with the scans . as you all do too. Hugs to you all",
