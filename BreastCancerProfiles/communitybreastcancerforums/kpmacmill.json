My skin is already starting to fade from the whole breast tx. I didn't have any skin issues really. Very, very red which has turned brown, but it never hurt. The only area where I got raw was my clavicle, and after a couple days of covering it with a Mepilex pad and aquaphor, it started to heal up. I feel very, very lucky. Good luck to those still finishing up, I hope it goes by fast.",

After two weeks or so of rads, I starting feeling fatigued around 5pm, so at least it was at the end of the work day. Still, not as bad as the chemo fatigue. JeniferE - I'm doing the breath hold, and while I despise it, I got used to it after a week or so. My center uses the SDX Spirometric Motion Management System (you can google it), so I have a tube in my mouth, clip on my nose and goggles on - not fun for the claustrophobic. Luckily, I found out I won't need to use it for my 7 boosts.",

We'll see how I feel tomorrow when I have to get up at 6:00am to go right to work - boo. MO put me on tamoxifen, so hoping for as few SEs with that as I had with rads. As far as the fatigue everyone is discussing, I was still fatigued from chemo when I started rads, so I wasn't sure if I was tired at all from rads. After about 4 weeks of rads, I starting feeling fine, so I think it was just leftover from chemo.",

My heart is in the way, so I'll have to hold my breath during treatment. They had me practice during the scans with a scuba-like mouth piece, a clip on my nose, and goggles on that showed a readout of my breathing. After about 10 minutes, I completely lost it. I felt so claustrophobic and made them take everything off and I started crying. They were very nice about and let me calm down for a bit before they did a final scan with me holding my breath. I have my simulation on Dec. 24th, then start 30-33 rads on Dec. 29th. - Kelly",

I made it though, and now that I did, I think I will be ok for my first rad on Monday. I know I am strong after all I've already been through, and I'm not going to let this bring me down! I will look at this as a challenge from here on, and I love a challenge. Happy Holidays to everyone! Kelly",

It hurt a bit, but was nothing compared to what I'd already been through. At the time my breast was still hard and swollen. Apparently the tissue was fibrotic, so I went to a lymphadema specialist for several weeks where she massaged my breast tissue and did some lymphatic massage to drain any extra fluid which helped a great deal. Now that the swelling is down, it appears that my breast implant (from before cancer) may have shifted or has capsular contracture from the rads...sigh...it's always something ain't it??",
