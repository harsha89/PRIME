It's been a week since my surgery and I am feeling a million times better :) I still have 6 drains in but I'm crossing my fingers that PS will take out 4 of them at my PostOp this afternoon. He will also change the dressings for the first time so it will be the first time I get to look at the new girls. I'm only taking ibuprofen during the day and Narco at night...but it's really not necessary at this point. I alternate sleeping on a rocking chair, our chaise lounge, the couch or my son's bed...depending the time of night. My butt gets so sore after sitting on it for a few hours...I can't wait to actually lie down on my side and curl up to relax. I also can't wait to get all these bandages off. You know that feeling of taking off your bra at the end of the night and it's such a relief not to feel so constricted??? Sigh...I want that feeling again. I am so constricted with the bandages and compression bra. And I really really really want to take a nice warm shower. And shave my armpits. Maybe I'll get lucky and PS will give me clearance tonight! I now have complete range of motion (although slow) with both of my arms. I can raise them both all the way up to the sky and do arm circles and shoulder shrugs. I am no longer walking like an old hunchback woman and am making a conscious effort to pull my shoulders back and walk like a lady. It is hard and tiring, but I know it's the right thing to do. My hubs yells at me because he thinks I'm doing too much...but the fact that I'm able to open our sliding glass door when last week I couldn't even touch it without wincing is a huge victory! It only gets better from here so hang in there, rest and allow your body to recover in the time it needs. Every day will get a little easier :)",

My understanding was if you have a low risk of recurrence then chemo isn't recommended since the cons outweigh the pros. I haven't talked to my MO yet, though. He's guessing I have a mid-high risk rate, plus I have to do chemo no matter what due to LVI. Too bad we don't have a crystal ball, huh?!?!",

TIA...you guys are awesome!  I'm also in my Dec 13 Chemo group but I don't feel as close to that group as this one :)",

My left side feels pretty good; I can almost raise my hand all the way up in the air and to the side. My right side is in a lot more pain, due to the sentinel node biopsy. I can raise my arm though so that's a good thing. Bending down to go to the bathroom was hard for the first few times (didn't help that I started my period after surgery - can you believe my luck) but it gets better every time. They gave me Norco for pain every 3 hours but I'm taking it every 4 when I'm home; I don't think I need it that often. I have 6 drains: 3 on each side. The drains are BIG! Take a VERY baggy shirt with you for after. I brought a sleep shirt but it was too tight and it barely buttoned! Fortunately I went to the hospital in a \"nice\" baby doll blouse that worked perfectly. I still felt somewhat cute since it was fitted on top. Yes, I can be slightly vain ;) My doctors squeezed me in so I had a very tight surgery day, here's the timeline: check-in @ 745am, bio nuclear med injection @ 9, surgery at 1145. Lucid in recovery by 330. They didn't have a room ready so I stayed in recovery until 7 - yuck. Ate cafeteria food @ 715 - delish! Doc visited @ 630am and said I could go home anytime since I wasn't nauseous and eating well. We hung around and left @ 230. As I stated before, I have 2 & 4 year old boys who use me as a jungle gym. They've been at my mom's house all day and got home @ 5. Hubby had prepared them well and they were VERY gentle. I could see how much the little one wanted to hug me but that ain't happening for a few days! I have an appt on Thurs with the PS to change the dressings and another visit on 11/11, nothing scheduled yet with the general surgeon. I'll call him tomorrow; I want to know how many nodes he removed other than the sentinel. Ugh - I hope that helps! I'm sleepy now, but let me know if you have additional questions. Much love to all of you :) ",

Doc said I'm healing well and I'll get out all six of my drains next Monday...NOT soon enough for me, but whatever :) I also got my pathology report back and they only removed the sentinel node and it had NO cancer - whew! I will still have to do chemo/radiation since it has invaded my lymphatic-vascular system. They also found ANOTHER cancer - 2cm away from the original tumor. This is a whole other cancer (DCIS) with a different pathology - how crazy is that? It just reaffirmed that I made the right decision in deciding to do a BMX, despite the fact that 2 out of 4 docs recommended a lumpectomy. The GS said yesterday that they probably wouldn't have caught it if they just did the lumpectomy. So I am super happy! gtgirl, and others who are freaking out: try not to worry so much and think positively. It sucks; we shouldn't have to be in this situation but we are :( I know things could be so much worse for me so I don't dwell on the negativity. Surround yourself with people who will listen to you and pull you up when you need help. My first son passed away when he was 3 from a genetic disorder; I thought at the time that I suffered enough with losing a child and that would be the worst thing God would throw at me. Well, I was wrong! Now I have to deal with this and I know I would rather deal with BC than deal with the pain of losing a loved one. It CAN get worse...I just hope it doesn't. Everyone is here to support you so reach out when you need help and try not to get sucked in to the internet horror stories! Sending you all strength and love!",

I can only assume its the fluid building up since I don't have drains. I don't hurt, but I just feel tight. I'm scheduled to see the PS tomorrow afternoon for my first fill. Should I be worried?
