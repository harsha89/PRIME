People on here say that a higher mitotic score responds better to chemo. Have you considered a second opinion? I am 39, 38 at diagnosis. My oncotype score was low, but if it was intermediate, I would have done chemo but I made up my mind to be as aggressive as possible with my treatment. I know other women on here feel differently, and it's hard that in some situations, these decisions are left to us.",
