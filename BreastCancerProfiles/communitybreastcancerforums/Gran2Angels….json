The radiologists also told me that my situation did not look good, as she was trying to prepare me for the worst, I think to be sure I that I did follow up with a biopsy.  My results were benign.  I have follow up mammo's every 6 months and so far no problems.  I'm editing this to also say: I know the waiting is awful.  Reading here was great for me. The information and caring posts were just what I needed to feel informed and ready to face the challenge, should there be one.... Be encouraged!  Blessings, Gran",

The customer service should be there to help you. Be sure and ask about online inquiries which are most helpful -  Some of these plans have everything online where you can check coverage and allowables or other special provisions.  Be encouraged - I hope this turns out to be a good plan for you.",
