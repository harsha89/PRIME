Ilene On another note, if there is anyone out there who is interested in reading up on studies on diet and its effects on health a great book is The China Study.   Not a book to read cover to cover, but a good reference book.  This is not a book about cancer, I found it to be a great resource when I was researching to find something to help my niece.  Just thought I would throw this out to anyone who might be interested.",
