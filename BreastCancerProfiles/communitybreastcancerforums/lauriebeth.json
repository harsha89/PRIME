In Dec I was dx with IDC stage 1 grade 1, node neg, ER and PR positive, HER2 neg, with lumpectomy and a 2nd to get the margins clear. should have been just radiation after surgery but then the Oncotype placed me dead middle of the intermediate range. So my oncologist strongly recommended chemo which I had only 4 although at first was going to be 8 treatments. It wasn't fun but it was not that bad either. Of course lost my hair, eyebrows but don't have to shave my arms or legs either....I feel it was the best course to keep me cancer free and grow into the old woman I intend to be in 30 or 40 years. At present there is no research to show either way for intermediate scores, however it was only 12 weeks and may be the key to remaining cancer free that woman before us did not have the opportunity to try. Just started radiation, tomorrow is #2. Laurie",
