After my second ac, Onco sent me for ultrasound and the tumor had actually grown on a/c. Switched to taxol and had immediate response. Ended up with 6 dd taxols and 3 useless a/c. Taxol sucked! Anyway, I had bmx on December 17th and got a call from my bs on Friday with pathology results. I had residual cancer and 3 positive nodes. She also stated that the tumor looked like Swiss cheese instead of a melted ice cube. Not sure what is in store as my bs expected the cancer to be dead and it wasn't. Scared and depressed. Cry a lot. I do know that I would do neo chemotherapy again knowing what I know now. Just wish I had insisted on more aggressive treatment and a pet scan before surgery. Maybe they would have done more chemotherapy. I don't know.",
