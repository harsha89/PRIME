      "Content": "Aug 4, 2012 02:41PM - edited Aug 4, 2012 02:43PM by gumshoe Thanks everyone for the feedback! I don't think it was an IV or vein problem since I had the same one in when I woke up. Joanne -- Yes they always visit me too beforehand, and this one did too, but he also didn't have my previous file since it was a more urgent surgery (< 24 hours' notice), and in a different hospital. michellej -- I think that's what happened here. After reading up on this last night, Propofol is notorious for causing a lot of pain (the \"Propofol Burn\"). Most anesthesiologists mix it with lidocaine and feed it to you slowly so you don't feel it, but it takes longer to put you out. It would explain it (if indeed that's what they gave me), so I will find out next week.",

His response: \"Maybe you just thought you yelled. I didn't hear anything.\"  I told him I'd bet my left breast that I yelled loud enough for everyone in the OR to hear. So, I'm on a mission to find out, now more than ever. ",

Usually I feel a very slight burning sensation in my arm as they're putting me out. Today, however, whatever the anesthesiologist put in the IV made me literally yell out in pain until I was asleep. It was horrible, like he had cut open my arm and poured acid into it. Somehow I think he must have missed a step. Has anyone else experienced this?
