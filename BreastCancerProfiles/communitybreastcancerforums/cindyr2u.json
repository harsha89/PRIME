I've had minor diarrhea both days, which I understand is not uncommon when the abdomen is radiated, but for BC??? Has anyone experienced that? My RO gave me some Miaderm samples today and said to start that right away, but reading an article on another topic, the md who wrote it said expensive creams and holistic creams don't do any more to help with \"burns\" than basically doing nothing.  Has anyone tried Miaderm or other creams for prevention of \"burns\"? I wish all of you the best. Cindy",
