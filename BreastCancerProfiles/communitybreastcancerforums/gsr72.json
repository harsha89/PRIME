    "Content": "gsr72 wrote: I posted a story a few weeks ago about a small biotech company that was featured in Popular Science magazine with a new blood test for Breast Cancer. The story is now being covered by FOX news. I was not aware of their work with Alzheimer's and Parkinsons, but my biggest fear is with Breast Cancer as this has been the major fear in my family. www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,3... I am very hopeful that this company truly has an early detection test. The national exposure will certainly validate the technology and help us to get it to market faster, if it really works.
