But still liver dotted with multiple lesions of 1-2 cm. Minor ascites is there and liver is still enlarged. Liver enzymes (SGOT level has gone up from 90 to 130. SGPT is normal. Wbc count has shooted up to 25000. Doc said chemo is working although bloating and other symptoms persist. As it is a progressive disease, we can only try to control it. But deferred the 4th chemo cycle for few days as wbc count is very high. He will do a CT scan just to be sure if Taxotere is working. Nevertheless he is planning to proceed with 6 cycles to extract the maximum benefit from it before switching to a different drug. Anybody got a high wbc count after chemo? It's puzzling me.",

Now have to wait till tmrw to get the results and new regimen. I find it really hard to convince my mom to take painkillers. She absolutely hates taking painkillers unless very bad. If the chemo works how long before one sees decrease in liver size?",
