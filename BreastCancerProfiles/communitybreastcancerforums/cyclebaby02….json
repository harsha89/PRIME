I am still night nursing my 2 year old (comfort nursing). On the same breast, I had a reocurring wound at the base of my nipple. I also feel a small mass in the same area. I thought it was an inefficient latch problem on my son's part. But it is not happening on the other side. I am scheduled for a mamo/usound tomorrow. Auxillary nodes are palpable. Any thoughts?
