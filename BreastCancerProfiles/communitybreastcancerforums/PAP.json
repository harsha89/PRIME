Zuzeee I love what you said about thinking about chemo and rad as \"our friends\".  I will try to remember that.  I'm going to brave it without a wig and just do the scarf and hat thing.  Some of the hats with bangs showing are really cute from tlc.  I think I'm more concerned about losing the eyebrows and eyelashes...no vanity there!  Thank you, thank you for all your comments and suggestions!",
