Suddenly my neutrophils have fallen to 1.0. My oncologist seems unconcerned and he is a hematologist too. But, I remember that 1.0 as being the cutoff for chemo. It is a very low count. Has anyone had an experience similar to this?",

I feel like I keep catching every cold that comes along, and I guess it's low lymphocytes causing that. Everyone here says they didn't have that problem. I'm not sue what to think. My onc doesn't seem worried--but he's not the one getting sick all the time.",
