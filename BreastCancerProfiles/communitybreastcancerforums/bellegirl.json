I never had to take my wig off.  My left arm was raised above my head.  My right arm was down, but I had to hold the breath hold control device in my right arm (press in when all okay, release if a problem).  The radiation techs had to open my gown to check the measurements to ensure I was in exactly in the right position (at beginning and mid way through).  Otherwise, the rad techs were extremely careful to close my gown at all other times.  They also regularly advised me of what would be happening next, if there was any issue etc.  Considering that I had probably at least 30 different technicians during the 25 treatments and set up (different appointment times every day, large hospital) it was obvious that they had received consistent training in making it as comfortable as possible for the women undergoing treatment.  Only 4 tattoos, no other markings.",

There is no research evidence yet that I know of, but some early trials showed potential.  So I take it regularly now, as it might help, and I have seen nothing negative on it.  Per the attached link, it has been used in Aurvedic medicine for thousands of years.  (Can't vouch for all the info in the article though.) http://www.canceractive.com/cancer-active-page-link.aspx?n=1571 I have just 2 treatments left now. I'm very thankful I have a late day rads appointment today, as we got about 15 to 20 cm of snow last night and it is still snowing, so the roads and commuter trains are all slow.  Hopefully travelling conditions will be better by mid afternoon. I have almost a one hour drive in good conditions to get to Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto.  ",

However I have a rash all over my left chest area, and the skin on the breast area and underarm is all red. Very itchy. The rate of skin trauma seems to be accelerating daily now. Like children sometimes ask at the table, I just want to ask the RO \"Can I be done now?\". I have to do the breath holding, and have been concentrating on that. Today will try to imagine the ocean waves though!",

My supraclavicular lymph nodes are receiving radiation. When I had my lumpectomy last Aug, no drain was used, and I did have a seroma.  I had asked the surgeon about that, and was told that they (that hospital group at least) no longer use drains for lumpectomies, as they found that there was a better long term result in the breast shape if they let the fluid be reabsorbed into the body over time (which could be up to 6 months or more).  However, I did develop a bad infection in the breast a week after surgery, which required antibiotic treatments for about 3 weeks.  It has been 5 1/2 months since the lumpectomy and most of the seroma has gone away, but I still have some hard spots in the breast.  I was told (several months later) that I should be massaging the breast to help those go away.",

However it has been cold up in Ontario in Jan, and I am not working right now, so not a problem. A bra should be comfortable once hot weather returns. Good luck to everyone still having treatments! You can do it",

I started radiation treatment on Dec 30th.  Had a short first week with just 3 treatments due to the holiday, so thankfully no skin issues yet.  I am using a GlaxalBase moisturizing cream, based on the hospital's recommendation. I have found it very helpful to read all the information/advice posted on this forum. thanks!  ",
