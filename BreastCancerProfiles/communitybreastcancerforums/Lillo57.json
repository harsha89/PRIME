After much consideration on my part and input from friends and family, it became clear to me that I should at least try it. If it gets too difficult, you can always lower your dose or stop. I completed 6 mos, one week off & one week on, and the SEs were manageable. Just be prepared with treatments to counter them. I agree with Trish, you are a young girl, and you need to throw everything you can at this thing",
