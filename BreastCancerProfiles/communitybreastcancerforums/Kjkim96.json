    "Content": "Kjkim96 wrote: Hi, I'm 17 years old and I recently found a small pea sized bump on my left breast. It's near the bottom just off center to my sternum. It's not really that painful but after doing some research I'm kind of scared... I also wear an underwire bra a lot so I don't know if it's just some sort of reaction... Anybody know? Thanks in advance :) I should also add that my family does NOT have a history of breast cancer... Am I just being cautious or paranoid? Log in to post a reply",
