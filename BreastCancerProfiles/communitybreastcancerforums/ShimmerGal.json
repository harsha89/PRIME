So lots of things I read about choosing docs and getting second opinions doesn't really seem readily available to me unless I want to start paying a lot to see those providers w/o them taking my insurance. The DIEP scares me because I read that the new foob can go into necrosis if there's anything wrong with the blood supply. I am DD now, & I definitely want to go smaller, whatever I choose. My surgeon didn't seem familiar with the newer Goldilocks procedure so I don't believe that will be an option given. Going flat seems like the least chance of any complications and the quickest recovery, use less sick leave and all that which is a concern if I am splitting things across multiple surgeries. I've scheduled an appointment at a mastectomy boutique to see the various prosthetic options in person and I hope that might help me decide. I won't be able to get in for the plastics consult for a loooooong time it sounds like!!! maybe five weeks.",

However, he said some data recently indicates that those cancers might originate in the fallopian tubes, so if I were to choose to go for it, that he would recommend removing the tubes. He thinks it is best to wait until I heal up from the PBMX procedure first, so this would be maybe around Sept at the earliest that I'd consider doing this. I will do more research on that procedure, because before my appt I had not even considered this to be an option and thus I know very little about it. At least it would be done laparoscopically so the recovery will be relatively easier!",

And apologies for any confusion, I had an emotionally messy night and starting second guessing everything about these procedures and changed my username this morning. I felt like I didnt want the name of the mutation to define me in any way. I wanted something more hopeful sounding.

I guess I have to wait to talk to plastics (waiting weeks for this appointment is going to drive me mad) but I feel like less surgical risk and less chance for complications would give me more peace of mind. maybe this is a side effect of all the biopsy-related-anxiety they've caused me over the years, but I hate the way my breasts/nipples look. If any of that remaining tissue is going to flip out and try to become cancer in the future, I don't want to spare any of it.
