I think they are designed for women who don\u2019t want their nipples to show. Anyway where I am concave on my mastectomy side, they poof our a little which is perfect. And I can add a little stuffing into the slot if I want more balance. I hate my prosthesis too. I\u2019ll check the exact style name and let you know. Good luck",
