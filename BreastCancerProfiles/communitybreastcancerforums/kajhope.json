I have never heard of that affecting the survival rate, I sure hope it is not true!  I wish now I would have mentioned it to the doctor. ",

Sometimes that may be more stressful for them.  I also did not share with my kids right away and once I did they really seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. (I just gave them a simple modified version)  But that may not work for everybody.  Hang in there. ",
