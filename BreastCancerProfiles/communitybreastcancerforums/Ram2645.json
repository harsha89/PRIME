Now I must be patient for another week......  I am trying to keep myself calm by reminding myself that even if malignant it is so tiny it is  curable..... but I must admit that now that the wait is longer than anticipated some hints of  apprehension are creeping in from time to time and the butterflies need to be tamped down from time to time....I find it difficult talking about it to friends and family because none have been through it and  do not want to worry anyone. Thank you all for being here and my thoughts are with all of you fighting your own challenges. Log in to post a reply",
