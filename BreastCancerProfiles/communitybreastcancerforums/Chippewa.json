It is your life on the line.  Good luck.  P.S.  I just cried with you.",

Reading up on Tamoxifen shows that it IS NOT for use in post menopausal women.  My doc is only putting me on the T for 2 years and keeping an eye on my estrogen level and that is the main factor in HT.  After 2 years or so she will switch me to an Aromatose Inhibitor. (AI) which stops estrogen production in post menopausal.  I have been on the T for only 2 months and seem to be doing very well so far.   Good luck and continue to research and ask the doc questions.",
