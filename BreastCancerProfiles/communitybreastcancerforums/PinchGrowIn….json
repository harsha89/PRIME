They were about $1.25 each in the hospital pharmacy, I lost a big half moon of skin under the breast, I used about six pads, almost all 5\"x9\". Here's my advice for this type of product based on my experience and some advice from the pharmacist:  My RO was really pleased that there was significant healing in 4 days of night-only use in the area. (I wore pajama tops over the tanks). People do wear them during the day also. During the time I was using them, I continued using my lotions and a little bit of Aquafor all over (the tank top was great for Aquafor protection too). I lotioned four times a day from the first day of treatment. Not everyone needs to do the same thing I did, of course, but my skin is super sensitive, and my RO worked with me on the frequency. I hope this helps anyone considering petroleum pads. I welcome suggestions, as well as content and editorial corrections!",
