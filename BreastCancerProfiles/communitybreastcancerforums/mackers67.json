Just a bit of background; I am from the UK (not that that makes any difference, just adds to the plot !!!) I was originally dx by accident no symptoms then I got a lump under my arm, the rest has been as you would imagine !! I have recently had a scan as my chemo part of my treatment on this occasion is complete.  The CAT revealed no further spread and bone mets responding, however I know that bone/pet scan will give full details regarding my bone and Im not having one of those until next month. So maybe it is my rib healing as you said,  its just it hurts all the time now and I wondered if anyone had experienced this while on Taxotere.  As you said Taxotere is a very good chemo and I really good results with it, so much so that in the end I was worried it would keep on working and would liquidize my internal organs when it had finished with the disease (joke!!!) .  However I know that chemo takes a lot longer to work on bone rather than soft tissue but I will just have to hope. I read your posts alot and I think you are very courageous and funny woman.  Well you cheer me up !! Thanks again for your time. Txx",

Anyway had a mastectomy two weeks ago... ok now..I received biopsy results today from the breast as Oncologist and Surgeon wanted to measure response from the Chemo as I have Bone mets and to allow them to gauge how the treatment was responding in the bone and stray cells in my system. Results:  From a 27 x 19mm tumour and additional 110mm total mass (told you I like to ignore things!!!)... They found after treatment a total of 10m mass and that was dotted around the breast, as Oncologist said last men standing( meaning cancer cells)!!! I dont know how things will progress and I dont even like to think about it and I dont like to tempt fate...but it looks positive for now.... have to have radiotherapy, zometa, hormone treatment etc etc etc... I was surrounded by women while receiving my treatment who had stage 2 and 3 cancers and I never wanted to share my story with them, as I didnt want to frighten them.... So I didnt say anything and let them think I was in the same situation as them and I would say that as my tumour was so big it had to  be shrank to allow me to have a mastectomy, which is why Docs wanted to measure my response. to treatment.    So I could honestly say to them, maybe not for everyone and again who knows what is round the corner, but at this moment FEC Taxotere and herceptin really does work and some people can have a very positive response from the treatment. I really dont like being too optimistic about my condition and feel VERY much for all those of ladies that arent having the greatest of times at the moment, but to all the ladies out there on these treatments I just wanted to share my experience to give us all a bit more hope !!!!  Love x Log in to post a reply",
