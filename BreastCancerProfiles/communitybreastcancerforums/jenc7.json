I saw my GP straight away who said to keep an eye and come back after 2 weeks if it's still there.  I tried to forget about and only went back to my GP last week when I could still feel it clearly there. It is not painful at all,  I can push and poke it with no pain or tenderness. When my GP felt it again she said she initally thought it was part of my rib as it's quite close to the chest wall, however she could see my fingers moving over it this time and said it definitely isn't and said it feels quite gristly and hard. It's about 5-10mm and almost oblong shaped.  GP referred me to breast clinic and I have my appt on Tuesday. I'm 28 with two young boys.  I can't see any dimpling or other visible changes but do get tingling, pins and needle feelings and sharp stabbing pains through my breast every so often which I have never felt in the left breast, only the right.  We have a lot of other serious illness in the family at the moment so I have done well not to worry too much about this, but as Tuesday approaches I'm starting to feel pretty nervous and feeling pretty nauseous when I think about it.  Just reaching out for a little support from others in a similar situation.  Thanks Jen   Log in to post a reply",

Everything crossed for Thursday.  I had my appointment but unfortunately they were two hours late seeing me and by that time a lot of staff had left, so I only had examination and have to go back for scans on Thursday. More waiting!  Doctor didn't really say much so I will just have to wait until Thurs.  Keep thinking positive thoughts! Drop us message if you need to talk!   Jen x   ",

Sara, yours sounds exactly like mine.  I have been occupying myself with cleaning, work, and playing at the park with the kids and will chill out practising yoga tonight, looking forward to that!  I know there's little point worrying about something that may never happen, or something that is beyond my control. Fear of the unknown!  My family have been kept out of this too. Probably no need to tell them anything, no need for others to worry unnecessarily too. It's nice to know that you are all here to share with though, thank you.  I am sure everything will be fine. Good luck tomorrow too Sara. Everything crossed for us all.  Let us know how you get on.  Jen x ",

Pleased to report that my visit today was a quick one, the consultant confirmed it is a mass of glandular tissue. He scanned the whole breast and apart from a few other similar areas, no concerns. Phew!   Very relieved I must say, but it's so sad to think of the less fortunate ladies who don't get good news.               Wishing everyone else positive results if they are going through testing. ",
