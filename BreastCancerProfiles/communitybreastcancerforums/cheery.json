Young and healthy with single met.  The statistics on the various reports I've seen are about 47- 60% 5-year overall survival or disease-free progression. You've probably seen these older reports but thought I'd still post it in case anyone else is interested.  http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/102/7/456.full http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingCoverage/ASCOGI/24490 It is widely acknowledged that ER/PR+ ladies have the best prognosis and the hormonal therapy can keep the disease stable for many years. Kathy Rich (19+ yrs) and Marybe (>10 years) have had great success with hormonal therapies. Ideally, of course, it would be even better if we can keep our disease further in check with curative surgical options too. I do believe your active approach and ER/PR+ status will help you do well:) hope you'll have a good discussion with the 2nd opinion and get your questions answered. ",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2013 10:13PM cheery wrote: Curveball  I'd responded to your other posts but I'm writing again as I've just had seen a liver surgeon yesterday. I'm almost 5 years out with liver met.  Indeed, BC tends to travel to the bones as the first site of mets rather liver or lungs. I've read that only 5-10% of BC travels to liver as the first site and as a single or two mets. This may be different for HER2+ BC as the liver met tends to be more common than bones, since HER2+ is much more aggressive.  The liver surgeon has said that the ideal person to have liver resection would be someone who was diagnosed at an earlier stage and has been stable for 10-20 years when a solitary or two liver met occured. He would then consider the person good for curative liver resection. I'm not a good candidate for liver resection, as I've just been told, as I was Stage IV from the get-go with a single liver met. Notwithstanding the fact that I was NED for the 4 years before this liver met recurred.  Liver surgeons are reluctant to operate on BC as it's considered a systemic disease. For BC to have travelled to liver, the assumption is that it'd have to bypass the bones and lungs (more common areas of BC mets) to the liver, where the blood supply is rich. Hence, the notion that liver mets are more aggressive.  This is different from colon colon as the liver is often the first site of mets. Hence, it is believed that the disease is still early and can be effectively \"controlled/eliminated\" with liver resection/cyberknife. Now the liver surgeon has said that if I were to insist, he can do the liver resection for me but he's pretty confident another liver met can pop up within 1 week of my surgery. He's one of the top liver surgeons in the region and I tend to believe he's saying this based on his experience.    The above said, the liver surgeon has said that if my liver met recurrence (now 2 instead of one), can be effectively controlled/eliminated by chemo/HER2+ agents in the next 3-6 months, I can still see him again for further discussion. I've read they need to see stability/NED in the liver region due to the downtime for liver surgery.  I can understand your anxiety and frustration as I've been living with this liver met for the past 5 years hoping to get a liver resection. I continue to live in hope for a liver resection and I think you should insist on a seeing liver specialist soonest to get a better feel of your possiblity of a liver resection. If anything, it'll address your concerns once and for all and I believe knowledge helps a lot in this crap disease.  Hope this helps. ",

Herceptin is known to have an impact on the heart, esp with Adriamycin. If she has heart issues, you can check with the onco if Herceptin is still suitable. Low ejection fraction caused by Herceptin is reversible once you stop it. But there could unforseen circumstances that we have to be careful about, if your mum has heart issues.  I'm not aware that Tykerb has any effect on the heart. Tykerb and Xeloda is a combination that is believed to cross the blood brain barrier. So there is a possiblity for your mum to have chemo with HER2 agent.  For mets, sometimes it is good to consider re-biopsying the mets (newly diagnosed) as the ER/PR/HER2 receptors may have changed and it will affect the treatment therapies. A biopsy, however, is invasive so you'll have to balance that.  For HER2+ brain mets, there is a treatment called intrathecal Herceptin. I'm not sure if it's relevant for your mum's condition. Link below for your reading:- her2support.org/vbulletin/show... I'm not a doctor so please check the doctor for the best treatment option for your mum.  All the best to you and your mum.   ",

I'd be tired for the first 2-3 days and my body would bounce back to normal after that. I did get prophylactic neupogen shots though. Hope Navelbine will help to kick those mets away for you.",

I was already NED by the time I'd my mastectomy 2 years after initial Stage IV diagnosis. I'm 4.5 years out, by the way Typically, for Stage IV, the conventional thinking is to control the disease and alleviate any symptoms. Doctors believe that as the disease is systemic, there is no point in treating the disease \"aggressively\" by putting the patients through more pain from surgery of any sort unless critical.  In recent years, however, there has been a shift in thinking and from observational studies that perhaps Stage IV can benefit from surgery too. Hence, they do allow a certain segment of Stage IV ladies to undergo surgery to improve prognosis. The big question is, do these Stage IV ladies do well due to the surgery/aggressive treatment or was it because they had been cherry picked in the first place with best chances of long term survival to undergo the surgery/aggressive treatment?  That said, I believe everyone should be given the choice of surgery as there is psychological benefit to removing the tumours, whether it's in the breast or elsewhere. Of course, the tumour load reduction is a major benefit too ",

Veliparib/ABT-888) can be very effective in some TNBC ladies and some others have chemo with targeted therapy like avastin. I'm not sure if there is any clinical trial in NZ for these agents as they can improve the effectiveness of chemos.  There are many other chemos that you've not mentioned, eg. Adriamycin, Xeloda, Halaven and Ixempra. I'm not sure why your oncologist has suggested hospice unless you no longer wish to do any more chemos and would prefer to try the alternative treatment options.  Perhaps you might want to seek a second opinion from another oncologist?  Take care and best regards. ",

It came back with a resounding 4.5cm after clean scans 3 months before.  And yes, that's why after 2 months of chemo, it's now shrunk down to 2.1cm. Chemo is more effective for the fast replicating (and aggressive) HER2+ cells.  I'm still gunning for that liver resection as I see it as my only chance of getting a shot at NED for a longer period of time. When I was NED for the last 3 years, I had sought opinions from at least 6 oncos who said that I should not go for the liver resection. Now, every onco just bows his head and say, go ahead now that it's back again.. Of course, it's too late now..I can't help but wonder what if I'd gone for the liver resection 3 years ago.. What I'm trying to say is, please find out more about every possible treatment out there and fight for your chance to get that treatment as we don't want to look back and wonder if we'd done all that we can..",

So there is a possibility that if you want to start slowly and ease into treatment, maybe the Herceptin infusion only will be easier on your body. When the liver gets better, then you can resume chemo.  Please do check with your doctors. ",

Bone mets are generally deemed to be slow growing while liver mets are considered more aggressive in nature. As such, your doc wants to quickly hit the liver mets hard with Carbo/Gemzar. This is a very strong chemo combo as each chemo on its own can be very hard on the blood counts. Both are known to be effective on liver mets.  You might want to start a new thread to get more feedback, otherwise there are several threads in Triple Negative. I've linked one for your reading.  Carbo/Gemzar Hope this helps. ",

The scans are reported as NED. I think it's used interchangeably but remission appears to be an older term.  Having fallen in and out of NED, I can understand the hope of looking forward to NED and the extrapolation that one may belong to that 1-3% that lives a normal lifespan (my doctor quoted 1-3%). So, while I'm definitely more realistic now about a cure for Stage IV BC, I'll always remember Kathleen Rich, who lived 19+ years with BC mets. I could be wrong (as I haven't read her book though) but I don't think she'd achieved NED. So, it's great encouragement for everyone that you can still hope to live a long life without achieving NED.  I think the research articles about curing stage IV BC is also spurring the hope factor. Personally, I don't think hope is bad but ultimately, we have to realise that in reality, these people are far and few as the cure for cancer remains elusive. ",

There has been research that patients who remove the primary tumours do better in the long run, but there is argument to that research as they'd cherry picked the candidates that will do well anyway (surgery or not).  My breast surgeon has told me that primary tumours do not respond well to chemo as they're slow growing unlike mets, which is very fast growing.  For me, it was a psychological effect as I just wanted the ticking time bomb of my body.  The surgery was pain-free in my case. I was in and out of the hospital in 3 days. Recovery took about a month with a bit of drainage required.  Hope this helps.  ",

I think the fact that HER2+ BC has a higher tendency to travel to the brain means there should be some updating of that \"standard of care\" for HER2+ BC. Todate, it hasn't been updated though.",

I appreciate your good intentions for sharing this, as you've been generously doing so on the other threads in BCO.  This concept in maintaining WBC levels to allow us to take higher doses of chemo is exactly what my TCM doc is trying to help me achieve with his herbal concoctions.  As this treatment looks fairly new, I'm concerned about the longer term safety but your naturopath sounds very experienced and I'm sure he'll check it out thoroughly on your behalf.  Warm regards and take care. ",

My onco says I'll need to be stable for at least 6 months before he'll let me do RFA/liver resection as there's downtime and we don't want the cancer to flare back up during this downtime.  But this makes me feel like I'm stuck between the devil and the deep blue sea. Last round, because I went NED, the doctors say I can't do any liver resection and now I still can't do any surgery as I need to be stable.. Sorry for the rant. I hope you'll get to NED soon:)  ETA - typo",

It does sound like she's got good family and friend support thoough:) Cisplatin is a platinum drug and I've read that platinum drugs can be very effective for TN and BRCA related BC. It's in the same family as Carboplatin. I'm having Carboplatin as part of my TCH regime. My doc told me it can be hard on the white blood cells and I've had to skip one chemo after 3 cycles. Overall it is doable with the usual chemo side effects.   Carboplatin can cause allergic reactions after several infusions. But this should be easily resolved by slower drip and extra decadron. The nurses would be closely monitoring for such reactions as it's fairly common.  Hope this helps. ",

Just a suggestion. I know it's very hard dealing with progression but please try to look forward to the next treatment combo as it may very well put you to stability/NED. Unfortunately no one can tell which of the combos can help you definitively until you've tried it..  So, I'm sure your onco still has lots in his arsenal and will recommend you something suitable. It will get better when you begin the next treatment. Please try to hang in there. ",
