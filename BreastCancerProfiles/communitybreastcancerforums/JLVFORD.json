    "Content": "JLVFORD wrote: Hi everyone. So I've had quite the month. Over the summer I underwent genetic testing because of a family history of breast cancer on my dad's side. Two of my aunts were diagnosed with DCIS in their 40s and my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer (unknown type) at age 27. I tested positive for the NBN mutation, which is a relatively newly discovered mutation. Because of that, my doctor recommended that I start screening at age 35 (I'm 29 right now), but we decided to do an initial MRI just to get a baseline. I had the MRI about a month ago, which showed an area of architectural distortion. My doctor immediately sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound. The ultrasound didn't show anything, but the mammogram showed a mass with architectural distortion. The radiologist was extremely concerned and more or less told me I had cancer. The following week, I had a biopsy and the results came back inconclusive because they weren't sure that they took samples from the correct spot based on the clip placement. So I underwent another biopsy and just recently got the results. The official finding is \"benign breast tissue with extensive proliferative fibrocystic changes.\" The report notes that the MRI and mammographic images remain concerning and surgical consultation is recommended. Basically, my doctor is adamant that I get this area removed ASAP. But it's benign, so I'm a bit confused as to why this is still a negative finding. I'm getting married in two weeks, but I have a few surgical consults set up for when I return from my honeymoon. Has anyone else had a diagnosis similar to this? Log in to post a reply",
