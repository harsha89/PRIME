Just a couple of relevant facts: Mom diagnosed Stage IV IBC - May 1, 2008- mets to lungs Chemo didn't work very well so they did a masectomy. She then started to get skin mets along the mast line- I think June 08- massive radiation. Around Dec. 08 she had a brain met and then liver mets. She had radiation for the brain met and the Abraxene cleared up the liver. However, the skin mets went out of control. So, we went to a place in CA where they are doing low dose radiation and hyperthermia. It is working on the skin but it is so advanced that clearing it up is a slow going process. Also, the mets were very infected by the time we reached CA. She also has a blood clot in one of her legs. At this point, she has a lot working against her. She is on massive pain medication Morphine and hydrocodone, CIPRO and a blood thinner. I don't know if it is just a combination of everything but she has become so weak that she can't lift herself up. They are supposed to be putting a catheter in on Monday so she can go to the bathroom. My sister and I are taking care of her ourselves. We are in CA with no family. I went to New Orleans this week and arranged for a home health aide who quit her job after helping mom one day- she couldn't handle it. So to make a very long story short,  I am not sure what to do to take care of her. I can't afford to pay for a private nurse and I am not sure her insurance will cover having a nurse everyday. I don't know if I should be trying to use hospice at this point or not? I just know that my sister and I are having trouble helping her and I am at a loss. Does anyone have any advise on resources? I looked up cancercare.org but they only thing I saw was possible financial aide for home health care. Thank you in advance... I really appreciate it as we don't have much family help and I just don't know what to do. Log in to post a reply",
