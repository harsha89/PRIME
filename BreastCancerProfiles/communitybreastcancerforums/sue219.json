My naturally thin eyebrows have thinned,but so far are holding out.  My elelashes also thinned but I havent worn mascara more than 5 times in 5 months for fear of causing any undo stress on them.  When are we out of the woods with falling out eyebrows and lashes?   From what I have read we can dye with natural no ammonia after 3 months, but would love to try after 8 just as a pick me up, has anyone done that and what product did you use?    Sue         ",
