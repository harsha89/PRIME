I just completed my therapy and received my custom glove and sleeve. It seems that the overlapping area of the two garments causes my hand to swell even more. Yesterday I just used the glove (yes my hand was slighty swollen last night) and then I wrapped the hand and arm for the night. While it was not totally gone it was down and soft. I see the therapist again on Monday but she is always interested in what seems to work for different people - so please give me some feed back to take to her. Joy",
