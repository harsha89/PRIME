I have heterogeneously dense breasts as well fibrocystic. However, I found an unusual lump in my left breast in May 2018 (that I can feel more prominent when standing up) and went to go see my Breast Specialist. She said she did not feel anything but ordered a diagnostic Mammo and US to investigate further. However, neither showed the lump I am feeling. It seems since then it has gotten slightly (but not too much) bigger. I have a scheduled appt with a different breast specialist on Wednesday. Why would it not show up on tests such as an US and 3D mammo but I obviously feel it? To me, It feels pretty deep as far down as the breast wall. It baffles me.. I am a little worried about things this time for some reason, but hopefully for no reason :-(",
