I did get it in my stomach...didn't hurt and it truly helps with the white blood count.   I went through 3 FEC and 3 Taxotere.   FEC caused more nausea and things but get the right meds for that.    The steroids with Taxotere made you feel pretty good so it wasn't as hard to take.   I did take some painkillers during the Taxotere onlybecause it can cause some bone pain  but nothing too serious. I want to wish you all well with your treatments and if you have anything you are concerned about just ask.  You can PM me or come over ot the June group and ask there. Best wishes,  Karen ",
