Came as a bit of a shock as I don't remember it being mentioned when I got the brain mets diagnosis last week. Anyway, I am starting on Xeloda tomorrow and very much hoping to follow in Mandy's footsteps... Best wishes with your treatments, Sunflower964",

It's going OK side effect wise but too soon for it to have kicked in so race against time really, and it's very discouraging feeling things getting worse. Really hope your treatment is successful and very best wishes to all. Sunflower xx",

Good luck to all still on treatment and thank you for giving me some hope for a while. Will try and get some rest now. Sunflower xx",

Also have spinal cord compression which was diagnosed late and unable to be adequately treated due to previous treatments. I was not a candidate for surgery. So prognosis would not have been great anyway. And not had much success with repeating hormonal treatments which had all previously failed (haven't triedMegace. But I also have a DVT so that would likely be excluded even if the NHS would provide it. Also the NHS is not willing to try things without a certain success rate. I did ask about methotrexate. Do appreciate your advice though. Had 6.5 years of good quality life with MBC and 7.5 between that and primary diagnosis. If I had been Her2+ that might also have helped but I'm not. Sorry to sound defeatist...Thanks again! Sunflower",

Doctors are happy that I can still hold decent conversations and move around with a frame but still... Asked why wbr not recommended for me and think it was to do with previous treatment, location of leptomeningeal mets, chances of benefit and other complications - I also have spinal cord compression & liver mets. So bad prognosis anyway and maybe no time to benefit from rads? How do people stop second guessing their decisions? Or if there's a clear recommendation from your team do you just go with it? Best wishes to all. Sunflower xx ",

Have only been offered WBRT due to number and size of lesions. As I'm not Her2 + and have used all hormonal therapy options only alternative seems to be taking capecitabine as there's a small chance it will help (can't see anything online to substantiate this though) and holding off on the radiotherapy for now. All the best with your decision. I think I'll have to ask for a chat with the consultant as have only spoken to a more junior doctor so far. Sunflower964",
