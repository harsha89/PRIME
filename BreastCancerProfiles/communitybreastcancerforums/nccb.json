The booklet I gotÂ said to do them twice a day, but I did them 4 times (broke pain pills in half to help). Also 2 days after the drain was removed I went back to jazzercise. It has helped me regain full range of motion. I am not quite 8 weeks out of surgery - about to start chemo treatments - and I can't believe how good I feel after surgery. Stick with it. It does get better.",
