I haven't been given too much more information to battle side effects, but, that being said.. I found out when I went to chemo appointment, my doctor conferred with doctor at Moffitt Cancer Center and because of the size and type of cancer I may be a candidate for a trial. So tomorrow I am driving 3 hours to the appointment. I will still start chemo ASAP. If part of trial but I will drive 3 hours weekly to get it....anyone driving long distance to chemo appointments or part of a trial? We have a group of poerful women! Than you for your inspiration!",

Were there other website etc you used as reference!? Also, I was reading over my reports. I had an ultrasound of both breasts. The doctor said he didn't see anything in the lymph nodes and I never felt anything. Then I went to the breast surgeon November 21, who felt something and biopsied it in the office. That report came back and showed the cancer spread to that lymph node. My next appt is with an oncologist after the results from my tests ( so 1-2 weeks). Who do I ask about this? The breast surgeon? Is the cancer moving fast? Or was it an over site on the doctor who read the ultrasound films. Thank you! ",
