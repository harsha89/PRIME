We do not know what stage it is in yet.  My question is....does everyone get a second opinoin before making a decision on treatment?  I feel like I'm in a whole new world these past few days and just really overwhelmed. We can see a different doctor for a second opinoin in 2 weeks, but I'm not sure if we should wait. Any thoughts? Log in to post a reply",
