Her doctors recommended her to have 4 sessions and she has already had 3, and is not feeling good after the last session. Is there any problem if she stops now and continue with Radiotherapy session? She is 41 years and 1.67 cm. Thank you for any information that you are able to provide. Log in to post a reply",
