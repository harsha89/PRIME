Or more specifically, how to wave it a tearful farewell.  I'm not sure why, but the thought of being without working ovaries fills me with such sadness.  At any rate,  I'm 43, with two young children, and wish to do the most aggressive treatment possible while maintaining a good quality of life.  Frankly, I'm not sure some days if \"good\"   is even possible, but perhaps that's the decadron withdrawal talking.   Ok --here are some of the options my MO has mentioned: Tamox with Zometa and Lupron shots Tamox with Zometa and remove ovaries An AI with Zometa after removing ovaries. I have a big case of chemo brain at the moment, but I thought I remembered reading that starting with Tamox, then going to an AI, even if one is in chemo or surgical menopause, offers more protection because the total years of treatment is greater.  Is this true? I'd love to hear from other Stage 3 sisters, especially those with young children, regarding the choices you made and some of the thinking behind those decisions.  I'm also wondering about how to choose btw  Tamox and AI, if indeed I can choose.   My tumor was ER+ Pr-, which complicates things somewhat.

I'm also seeing an acupuncturist.   And I must confess that I started to cry a bit yesterday when he told me not to feel badly about still needing pain meds at night. His words: \" Listen, I'm not usually one to push the pills, but they do have their place.  The damage done from unrelenting pain is worse than what the narcotics will do you.  You won't be on them forever.\"  I'm not sure why, but his comments lifted this cloud of guilt/shame/worry I've been carrying around.  I keep reading about all these women who never took pain meds, or stopped after day two post-surgery.  I wanted to be one of those women.  I thought for sure I would be. Like so many other things on the BC highway, this detour ( or is it a flat?) is reveals a humbling truth: our bodies are strong but not always responsive to our plans.   I need to learn to love mine again anyway.",

Anyway, I started chemo in December, then had time off for good behavior. In this case, good behavior = two weeks, then bmx on February 8th. I start the fun again on Friday ( dd taxol x 4). AC kicked my butt down the block and back again... But at least I knew where we stood. Starting with the new drug is giving me the willies big time. I' ve got the usual supplements lined up on the counter, but can't make myself start taking them. I don't want to go back to that chair, you know??? Any in this group taxol experts? Tell me good news...or if you can't, tell the bad stuff with humor. Thanks again S",
