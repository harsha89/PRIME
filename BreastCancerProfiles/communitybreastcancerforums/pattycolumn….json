I understand that all the CONTENT of my breasts are gone, but the skin and nipples are still there. In fact, it looks like a lot of wrinkly skin but tacked down (doesn't move yet but I can tell it's loosing up). My PS said he will put some fill to build up the upper portion of my breasts. I will have a lot of questions for him when I see him as it gets closer. @blah333 I read all the previous posts and now know what chest contouring and TRANS top surgeries are! Thanks to all of you for the posts. So much to know about all of this. Thank you!",

No radiation and hopefully no chemo. Stage IIB, invasive lobular.... Ironically, I just thought about saving the nipples at my extra skin removal surgery in the fall. All the extra skin is fascinating and Stephen Kingish looking at the same time lol. On a scale of 1 to 10, how uncomfortable to you? Thank you for sharing your story!",
