    "Content": "Kushcobain wrote: I got a core needle biopsy done December 20th, the results were discordant because the radiologist/surgeon said that the diagnosis given on the pathology report didn't explain what was seen on the ultrasound. The surgeon suggested I do a lumpectomy/excisional biopsy even though my bi-RADs score was 3. I got the lumpectomy/excisional biopsy today and the surgeon said it looks like a rare type of tumor. I'm a bit concerned because the core needle biopsy was wrong, and now I'm waiting for the new results. The original results were proliferative stromal fibrosis, has anyone else been in a similar situation?? I've been trying to get a diagnosis for 4 months : Log in to post a reply",
