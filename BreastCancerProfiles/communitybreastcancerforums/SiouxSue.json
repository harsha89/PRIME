It has not yet been tested because she would need to be very heavily sedated for the process, due to her Alzheimer's. The medical consensus seems to be that \"we don't want to put her through it if we don't need to.\" The doctor (a gerontologist, specializing in the elderly) has recommended \"watchful waiting\" to see what the lump does rather than rush her to a hospital for a mammogram or needle biopsy. She said that - in women mother's age - breast cancer is not usually agressive. It is NOT what will kill her, in the end. I can find nothing on the Internet which agrees, but nothing that disagrees, exactly, either. I find no discussion about breast cancer in women over 80. Can anyone point me at research which supports that view, or says it's totally wrong? Or provides me with some additional information? The doctor said that 86-year-old women typically die of something other than the breast cancer - it is the \"loser\" in the race to end her life when vying with the Alzheimer's, pneumonia, etc. She has moderately advanced Alzheimer's - is in a wheelchair, cannot communicate effectively, cannot really understand what is said to her, and, when hospitalized for a UTI 3 years ago, needed to be sedated to keep her from pulling out the IV's. She would need to be pretty heavily sedated to be taken (via ambulance) to an oncologist. She would need to be very heavily sedated for a biopsy or any other test to see if the lump they found is malignant. She would not understand what is going on (she cannot communicate, and everyone is a stranger to her), and it would be highly stressful to her. My heart breaks at the though of her hospitalized, recovering from a lumpectomy or mastectomy. She would pull at dressings and tubes, resist medication, etc. It would be terrifying to her! The horrible irony, of course, is that her body is in much better shape than her brain. Low blood pressure, low blood sugar, low cholesterol, good heart and lungs, etc. Is the doctor right about breast cancer usually being non-aggressive in 86 year old women? Does anyone else have any experience with this kind of situation? Log in to post a reply",
