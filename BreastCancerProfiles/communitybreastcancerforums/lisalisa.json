So, I told my kids.  I told them in very simple terms and was sure to include the words breast cancer.  They don't have any preconceived notions about \"cancer\" so the conversation went well.  I was sure to tell my kids that I will answer any questions that may come up.  A few days later, my 9 year old son asked more about hair loss.  He wasn't so bothered by the idea of me losing the hair on my scalp, but my nose hairs LOL!  he figured out that without nose hairs, I'll have a runny nose and he thinks that is gross!   So, just go with it....your kids will likely surprise you!  Best of luck to you!

I digress.  RE: my bilateral, I had a lumpectomy first and didn't get clean margins.  My arm healed pretty well that time (6 nodes taken).  For my bilateral, I had 11 more nodes taken.  How many did you have taken?  I ask this b/c I think its the node removal, not the mastectomy, that makes your underarm numb!  My surgeon says it will take time to fully regain movement.  BUT....you may NEVER get all your sensation back.  Your arm may have dull sensations and that is reason to be careful i.e. you may not feel pain as easily.  For me, even my bra moving out of place is not as noticeable i.e. I have to look in the mirror more than feel it kwim? I would try PT.  I'm going to schedule my first session for next week.  Can you believe I haven't driven since 11/18!?!?  I need to get full range of movement back to drive my big heavy SUV or trade and take DH's smaller car LOL!",

We talked over all options: tamox tamox w/zometa soft trial ooph, arimidex, zometa My gut was to go with the ooph.  Especially since I'm 85% ER+.  My onc's big thing is that unless the ovaries are GONE, even with tamox, your body can still make more estrogen! She thinks the last option is best for me and I agree.  I'm so tired...but if you want to read more of my though process, go to my caring bridge.....http://caringbridge.org/visit/lisamittleman I'm off to bed.  Will gladly answer any of your questions tomorrow! oh....I don't think I told all of you but I'm going to 2 day training with Young Survival Coalition this weekend.  I'm training to help counsel those that have been newly diagnosed with breast cancer.  So, I'm going to meet a bunch of survivors this weekend as we learn to help others.  I'm pretty excited to put my experience to use and help others!  but, it will be a LONG weekend considering I'm just 10 days out from chemo! ",

I'm obviously not a doctor, but when my oncologist explained that all to me, it was an easy choice for me.  Plus, I will be \"protected\" by tamoxofin for another 5 or 10 years or a lifetime after that!  By that time, there may even be other treatments.  Just wanted to chime in with what I have learned.  Best of luck making your decision!  We'll support you no matter which way you go!

If you haven't seen it, on the chemo board, there is a great list of items to shop for and have on hand.  I used it and haven't need many of the products.  But, b/c my chemo was the 23rd and shot on the 24th I stocked up on everything.  I didn't want to need something on Xmas Eve and not be able to get it!

Mimi - glad you got your port in.  I think its a great way to go.  Mine was only uncomfortable for a few days.  Its been about 9 or 10 days for me now and I don't even think about it anymore!

Carpediem - good luck with your PET scan and MRI.  I hope you get results quickly.  Its so hard to wait!  And, I hear you on the hair thing....I cried more over my hair than over any other part of this!

I got a prescription for a hydrocortisone to help.....stronger than the OTC kind. My gyn onocolgist was AMAZING.  He was thorough too.  We met in his office first and went thru my medical history, family history and cancer history.  Then, he did a pap and then an ultrasound.  He also examined me at length....twice to double check.  ack! He says that I'm not completely in menopause.  I'm having hot flashes but not night sweats.  I'm drier than before but not \"dry\"....TMI, but I still have some mucous.  Despite that, my endometrial lining is down to about 3.5 and that suggests menopause.  As well, no activity in my ovaries.  So....I'm kind of in between.....not all the way in menopause like I need to be. As I was on the table, I couldn't take notes.....but I told him that I needed a \"sling\" since having 2 kids.  I hate that I can't sneeze or run without peeing a tiny bit!  He said that my bladder HAS dropped ALOT.  He also said that other parts were dropping....but can't remember which ones! So....we went back and forth and decided that we REALLY need the estrogen out.  I'm going to go for the full hysterectomy.  I want to do this once and only once! So, I'll have a lap assisted vaginal ysterectomy and removal of tubes and ovaries.  And, I'll have a vaginal repair and mic urerthral sling. I had him write down all my \"issues\": SUI (I think that means the peeing part LOL!) cystocele rectocele uterine prolapse This will be about a 3 1/2 hour surgery and I'll need to stay in the hospital for one night.  Then, won't be able to do any lifting or exercising for some time.....but I can walk for exercise.  I'll be talking with his scheduler soon and will try to fit this in in July....after rads is over but before our vacation.  Are we having fun yet!?!?!? p.s. to those who asked.  I'm BRCA negative.  BUT, I want to get rid of my excess estrogen as my tumor was highly ER+.   Most geneticists/breast surgeons/oncologists HIGHLY reco an ooph or hyst for BRCA+ patients.",

The only complication that I have is that one of the stiches in my abdomen (i had immediate DIEP reconstruction) popped a while ago.  It was a tiny opening and my plastic surgeon cleared me for chemo.  I swear its a tiny bit bigger now (still small) and has icky yellow stuff. Only me!  ugh.  So, its making me nervous and I'm calling the PS today to have him check it out.  I wonder if it stopped healing so well when my WBC went down!?!?!?  So, today, if he's in, I'll go see him to have this looked at.  My chemo was moved up at the last second from 12/29 to 12/23....maybe that wasn't the best plan, huh?! Anyway, other than that, I'm just waiting on the hair thing.  My underhair http://www.hatswithhair.com/HowToOrder.aspx is not here yet but shoud be here Monday at the latest.  I want to go to both kids' basketball games this weekend as well as a soccer game and a dinner with friends on Sunday.  I hope my real hair will hold out till Sunday night/Monday morning!  Monday is day 14.  Oh, the stresses LOL! thanks for listening jewels!  Best of luck to all starting chemo today!",

I'm curious....why does your doc NOT recommend a port?  Mine thinks a port is a good idea but maybe that is because I had 6/17 positive nodes and therefore already \"lost\" one arm.  Don't want to damage the veins in the other arm.  Would love your thoughts.  thanks!

ANTICIPATION.....is so much worse than reality sometimes. Today was one of those days. I was SCARED to go to chemo. I DREADED it. You know what? it wasn't bad!!!! I lucked out and got the BEST nurse. Her name was Susan. She explained everything as she went and was so thoughtful! Yeah....I was OWED a nurse like her! I was lucky too. We took off the bandages for my port and the steri-strip was above the port. So, I got to use the lidocaine!!!!! I didn't even feel anything when she stuck my port. That was the biggest RELIEF. OMG! So, she pumped me up with benadryl and that made me sooooo drowsy. I fought it and tried to stay awake to watch \"How to lose a guy in 10 days\". Then came the anti-nausea meds and the antibiotics. Last were my 2 chemo drugs. She spaced them out a bit so that we could see if I had any bad reactions. But, all went smoothly. YEAH! The anti-nausea drugs made me a bit restless and kind of hyper so it was hard to sleep. Next time, I'm sleeping after the benadryl. But, I did manage to sleep about 2 hours or more. David stopped and picked up takeout from California chicken cafe. I got a chinese chicken salad wrap and mashed potatoes. YUM!!!! Now, I'm drinking my \"throat coat\" and its not bad! I think I'll live thru this LOL! Tomorrow, I plan on taking a long walk on the beach. Today I walked on my own to get a manicure and pedicure. It was so nice! I haven't been ANYWHERE by myself in over a month! I also washed my hair with the handheld faucet in my bathtub. I stood over the bathtub and washed my hair upside down while wearing David's plastic trench cover (you know...when you're hiking or outdoors and get caught in rain!??) Anyway, we took pictures and I'll post one soon. We also took pictures at the chemo place. I was lounged in my leather recliner, blanket on, fuzzy socks on and cute pink hat LOL! Note to all my ducky friends, I wore the bracelet you gave me and the good luck worked!!!! I came home to a package from HeavenlyHats.com. They sent me a box of 5 or 6 hats. At the rate I'm going I'll have a hat for everyday! I also got to 2 knit hats at the chemo place....a baby blue hat that is so soft and will be my sleep cap, and a red and black hat with a fun flower on it. Thank god for volunteers! So, all in all, I'm feeling good. Tomorrow night, my friend Joanna is coming over to give me my Neulasta shot. She's so sweet to come over after Christmas Eve mass and before her family Christmas dinner. She's a nurse and I'm so grateful that she has saved me from going out to a doctor tomorrow. The Neulasta is to build up my white blood count. But, it goes right to the bone marrow and is supposed to be VERY painful. I think I may pull out one of my \"spare\" vicodin pills! That's all for now. Thanks for the many messages, emails and facebook posts today. I read them ALL! love, Lisa",

The lemon is better tasing but not as much licorice.  I plan to alternate.  I'm not a tea person at all....and I\"m enjoying it!  hope this helps! Lisa",

Another thing I do is make smoothies.  Milk, yogurt, whey protein with lots of fruit and honey to sweeten it.  I stary with plain yogurt so there is not so much sugar! good luck! Lisa",

For the most part (other than my hair) I'm not falling apart (yet).  I find my support group helpful for the most part....I do have some issues with it....sometimes I think the moderator feels like there is a deeper message.  I don't really need a \"message\", I just want to get thru this!  What I find most helpful is journaling my  treatment.  I have a caring bridge site where I update after appointments, chemos, etc.  It works well to update family/friends in one fell swoop.  As well, people can leave messages back. I'm also starting art therapy next week.  I'm VERY excited about that and will post here after my first class on Wednesday! Re: chemo bag.  I take book, dvds (each chemo chair at my infusion center has a personal dvd).  Iphone, noise cancelling headphones.  I bring fuzzy socks with rubber on bottom to wear and a knit hat. I bring a big blanket and small pillows to make me comfy. I also bring lots of water and snacks.  Lastly, I have a few candies, especially peppermint.  As far as more \"medical\" type stuff, I bring my lidocaine cream to numb my port, lotion, toothpase/toothbrush, mouthwash, tissues, etc.    There is a great list of things needed for chemo on the chemo board!",

We also came up with a plan for chemo #6 in light of my horrible nausea in round 5.  Next go round, I'm dropping my steroids down to 1/2, taking Emmend for days 1,2 and 3.  And, then using the Sancuso patch for day 4 and beyond.  I feel like we're doing as much as we can proactively.

I'm feeling pretty good these days.  Actually feeling almost normal (though not looking normal...pretty much have lost ALL of my eyelashes and most of my eyebrows).  Chemo #5 on Tuesday.  Last week at this same time, I had my doubts about EVER doing chemo #5 or 6.  Things change FAST!

My nails have ridges ALL over them and two of my toenails have turned completely white....I don't know if htey will fall off or not.  I keep them covered with polish (bright pink) so that I don't have to see them LOL!

Today was day #14 of radiation for me and I'm starting to get red and a bit itchy.  But, its certainly not as bad as chemo. Tomorrow I see a gyn oncologist for the \"talk\" on removing my ovaries.  I hope he's on board and that I can get this scheduled! Hope you're all doing well....will check back in soon.  Thinking of you Patti and Phylis as you finish up! Lisa",

Leave a few dishes, glasses, out in the kitchen.....again no stretching.  Stock up on groceries.  Catch up on laundry.  You'll be fine....REALLY! kmmd - LOVE your new avatar!!!  where did you get it?  i want to copy it if you don't mind.  i just secured the domain name HowToFightLikeAGirl.org    I'm going to put together a website to help those newly diagnosed.

Will I be too tired to fly?  to sail?  More importantly, will it impact my rads if I skip for a week and then come back and finish? I have 36 rads treatments (including boosts).  I'd leave after #29 or so and then come back. THOUGHTS? thanks so much! DX 9/12/08. Lumpectomy 9/25/08 6cm, Stage 3, nodes 4/6, ER+/PR+, HER2-.
