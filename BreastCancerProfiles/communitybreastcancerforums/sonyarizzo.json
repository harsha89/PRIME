Treatment was removing my ovaries(I was only 37) and I was placed on Arimidex. I was NED for about a year and then when that changed I was placed on Fasolodex. That didn't work and that is when a PET showed that it had spread to my liver. This all happened only 3 weeks ago. Liver biopsy confirmed that I am still ER/PR + HER2-. So I started on 5mg of Aromason and Afinitor. I am moving up to 7.5mg in a few days and then I will go up to 10mg. So far I have no side effects. Just a bit tired. Scared of moving up in my dose. Anyone else have success with this combo?",

I got a year of NED when I only had bone mets and when NED was done it was a punch in the gut!. I had a liver biopsy back in September when liver mets were first discovered. Still ER/PR+ and HER2-. Do you think I need another biopsy? Maybe I do because all of the liver and bone mets went away on Decembers Pet scan, but liver mets came back on February's liver MRI. Wonder if that means that the status has changed. I will talk to my dr about that. My dr is saving IV chemo until we run through all of the oral ones. He wants me to have quality of life, so he is starting with the things most easily tolerated. I did chemo 4 1/2 years ago when I was first diagnosed and I had a really hard time with it. I had a molecular study done on my liver biopsy. It showed that I have a genetic mutation which makes me become immune to hormone therapy after awhile. I had a good run on Arimdex(almost 2 years)...but since then I have failed everything rather quickly. He thinks that is why I became stage 4...because tomoxifen failed me after only being on it one year. I haven't had any other DNA testing done besides that and also to see if I was genetically positive, which I am not. What other DNA testing is there? I would love to have that done. Thank you for all of the great info. I wish you the best of luck on your new treatment and I hope you dance with NED again very soon. Woodylb, I know that while on Afinitor, I may have used the word NED too soon. I had only been on afinitor for 3 months at the time. I got overly excited when the radiologist brought my husband and I into a room and said, I see no evidence of disease in your bones and liver. It was amazing news, but as my markers continued to climb, I knew that my cancer was still looming and waiting for a place to land and I was right. It landed right back in my liver, and this time worse than the last time. I have IDC...but I seem to remember my initial report saying that I have IDC with lobular features. I have no clue what that means. Do you know how often you are suppose to get a liver biopsy? UGG, I would hate to go through that again. Praying that Ibrance is working and the waiting is hard. Now knowing I have to wait a full 3 months to see if it is working means I won't know till the end of May. Thank you for all of your good advice : ) Kaayborg, I am so happy to hear that your combo is working. I love to hear when things are actually working for people : ) I am sorry that it is knocking your platelets down. I had a friend who was on Abraxane/carboplatin and she had the same problem. She has a blood transfusion and she felt so much better after that. I will check out the \"ladies in their 30's\" thread. I just turned the big 4 0...will I still be allowed..LOL! It is so hard when you have young children. Mine aren't so young anymore ( 10 and 8) but me being sick is all my 8 year old knows of me. She was so young when I was diagnosed. Both of my kids have a really hard time with it. When I keep them informed about what is going on it seems to ease their fears. I have so much guilt for what they have seen me go through. No child should have to fear their mother dying. My 10 year old once said to me that she was afraid that she was going to come home from school and I was going to be dead. It broke my heart. I so badly want another 10 years so I can see them both off to college. I pray every day for a miracle. I know it is probably not in the cards for me, but still miracles happen every day. I wish you luck on your journey. Thank you for chatting with me. Luvmyfam, I pray that your PET shows that your cancer hasn't spread anywhere else! Hoping we all find treatments that give us years! Isy, What treatment cut your CA 27-29 in half? I think I have seen you on the Ibrance thread, so I am hoping it was that. Having your CA 27-29 with three 0's is very scary. When I first saw mine, I thought it was a mistake! Praying to cut mine in half. Will find out soon enough. You are right, the uncertainty and unpredictability can drive us NUTS! It is such a roller coaster. I would just love to be NED for awhile. I just want a bit of a break from this crazy roller coaster. Babs, I am so glad that you are finally on something that works. I pray it works for you for a long time! : ) Xeloda is my next step when Ibrance fails me(I almost typed if instead of when) Guess they all fail us at some point. Just really hoping to find something that gives me a big break! Artistatheart, I am sorry that you had to go off of your combo. Hopefully the Faslodex is doing its job for you! Praying your scan shows reduced tumors or none at all! The liver pain is haunting. It is just a constant reminder that we are sick. I hate that, because I look totally normal so it is hard to grasp that I am actually really sick. Thank you ladies so much for all of your advice and words of encouragement. The support here is amazing! I pray that we all find treatments that work for us and give us breaks off of this roller coaster once in a while.",

During my last treatment(afinitor/Aromasin) the same thing happened and my 3 month scan was clear. I know that the pain can be discouraging, and we all pray that the pain is from the treatment working and not from the cancer growing. It is so hard to wrap our heads around sometimes. Today has been an especially hard day for me. I feel like crap and my whole right side hurts.

I have had bone mets for 3 years and liver mets since September. I started with afinitor/Aromasin. At first it seemed like it was working. First PET scan in December was clear. But them my TMs climbed a lot so we did a liver MRI and sure enough the beast was back. So after 5 months on Afinitor/Aromasin, we switch to Ibrance/faslodex. I'm almost done with my second round. One tumor markers went down and two went up. Onco is talking about 12 weeks of taxol. I asked if we could please give ibrance/faslodex a bit longer. I hope I'm not making a mistake. I have blood work on Wednesday to see if TMs are still rising and a liver MRI on the 19th and then a PET after my 3rd round. In my opinion if things have stayed the same and have not progressed, then I want to give the ibrance more time. Any advice",

I spent over two years making myslef crazy waiting the full 24 hours for results. So I called and asked to speak to the head of the department and told him how stressful it was to wait and now I see the radiologist right after my scan. It saves so much stress. I hate those nasty thoughts of thinking I won't be here for something in the future. Especially with an 8 and a 10 year old. It cripples me sometimes. I am sure that most of us deal with depression. I mean who wouldn't be depressed about knowing how you're going to die but not having any clue when. It's a really sad way to live. I try to make the best of it and in front of people I am always so positive. But when I'm alone I do get really sad and I cry a lot. Not huge cries usually(takes too much energy). Just a few tears. Doing it as I write this now. Just sick of being sick. And not knowing the future is really scary. Sometimes I feel ok with it all. Sometimes I feel like I know I'm going to heaven and God has a plan for me. But lately I have just been feeling sad and angry because I want to be here in this life. I want to meet my grand babies. But unless a miracle happens I don't see how that is possible. But hey miracles happen everyday",

After liver mets were discovered, we tried Afinitor/aromosin and although my first scan after that was clear, my TM's and liver enzymes continued to rise. Then about a month ago a liver MRI showed lots of growth on my liver so we changed meds to Ibrance/faslodex. I have been on this combo for a little over a week. I am tolerating it pretty well. I have my first blood draw since being on this med next Tuesday. I am a bit scared because my numbers have been really high. I have read some peoples numbers on here and also on the Ibrance site and mine just seem scarey...Last blood work showed AST 172,,,ALT 143.....LDH 778....CEA 567.......CA27-29 11,907 and CA15-3 1654. Anyone else have scary high numbers like this before? My cancer has always behaved strangely. I was diagnosed at 35, I am now 40. In 2011 I had 6 tumors in one breast. In 2013 I had innumerable tumors in my bones, I had my ovaries removed and there were cancer cells in my ovaries. I am not genetically positive so it is strange for it to go to my ovaries. Then in September 2015 I had innumerable tumors in my liver. By December I had clear scans..No tumors anywhere...but numbers continued to rise. Then in February innumerable tumors again in the liver. I am just scared. I have two young children and I pray that the new meds are doing something. I do have some liver pain. Nothing too terrible just an ache every so often. I try to stay positive, and I pray a lot. I just need these scary numbers to come down and for the tumors to stay at bay for a bit. Just trying to buy as much time as I can.",
