I was diagnosed 8 months ago at 38 yrs. old, and have 4 small children (10,8,5,3).  I had chemo first, just had a double mastectomy, and will start radiation in 2 weeks. My husband and I decided that we had to be honest, open, and understanding of our kids during this process. A few days after my diagnosis, we sat down with our 8 and 10 year olds and had a long talk, telling them what was happening to mommy, and what they could expect to happen to me in the upcoming months. They had a ton of questions, and we were hopeful and honest. Our younger kids were too young for this discussion, but the came to understand that mommy has a boo-boo. I felt that it was sooo important to maintain the kids' routines during my chemo, but they learned to adapt to me being in bed, and if they needed me, they would come and lay with me. You will make it work, and children are amazing in that they are so adaptable and accepting. When my hair started falling out, we laughed too (just like Lexislove!), and when we buzzed it off completely, the older kids came in the bathroom and watched, smiled, took photos, etc...and, this helped ME stay strong and to see that even in dark times, there can be smiles!  Also, get your rest! Accept help from those who offer it so you can rest when you need to. This way you can be there for the kids when you do feel good. I hope somehow this helps. Maybe just knowing there are other young moms out there who have done it and SURVIVED will help you!!! I wish you the best of luck! Stay strong!  Liz ",
