He is basically ok, lots of road burn, scrapes ect.. He will be quite sore for a few days to come. He was riding his roomates cycle--not good--no cycle endorsement on his licence as he was just trying it out--so he did get a ticket for that. He lives several hours from here but his roomate was so kind to keep calling me with updated reports and to let me know he was \"OK\"",

I too am having so many aches in my joints and muscles, I am assuming it is because of the Arimadex but maybe a chemo effect as well. Tomorrow is my pre-surgery visit with the PS Nervous but excited, I have heard so many great stories about reconstruction but also some not so good ones too, but I am trying to be positive about it all. This will be a two parter, First to add padding then implants in a couple months, maybe I'll be put back together by my birthday the end of January. Would love to be able to buy something pretty and sexy again.",

I too have just cut my hair above shoulders went wig shopping and they all looked awful but then pat of it was because of the reality of it all and it wasn't my hair maybe I'll just stick with hats and bandanas, as impatient as I am I'm sure I'll be obsessing daily about hair--Today I get chest e-rax to make sure lung healing properly after the freak incident with port DR said this was rare so don't worry my thoughts are with you hold you head high and know this time next year we will be giving the advise to the newbies!!",

I am a little nervous How do they know the Chemo did the trick? Do they run more scans? Exrays? I will be taking Tomaxafin or Arimadex will run one more test to see if I am pre or post menopasal. I like other girls on this site hope we can all stay together to keep in touch with all that is going on with our lives. the no hair on my head doesn't bother me as much as the no eyebrows and eyelashes.",
