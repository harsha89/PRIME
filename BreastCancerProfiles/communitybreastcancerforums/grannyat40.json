I just did a self referral, rather than having to see my doc first, thinking I would save some money, and since it was 3 months past time for me to have it done, I went and had it done. No one asked me the day of the mammogram if I had felt anything, so I just thought I would see what that found. Two days later I got a call from my primary care doctor, who is in another town, telling me that a nodule had been found that they could not see clearly and I needed to have further images done. When I went to the hospital in the town where my primary care doctor is, the first thing they asked for was the films from the mammogram on the 17th (which no one told me to bring with me), without these they didn't know where or what they were looking for, but they would take a look anyway. After not seeing anything on the mammogram, not even seeing what was seen on the first mammogram, they decided to go ahead and do the ultrasound. This time the person doing the ultra sound asked me if I had felt something and if that is why I had the first mammogram done. I told her that was not why I had had it done. I had it done because it was time to have it done, but I had actually felt something and showed her the area where it was. I've have several needle biopsies in the past as well as having some cysts surgically removed. When the lady did the ultra sound and came back with the radiologist (since she's not allowed to say anything), I was told that nothing showed up on the ultrasound, either. I said, \"not even the lump that I feel right here?\" and they said no. Again I said, you didn't see anything right here? Pointing to the area where I feel the lump, and they said \"no\", nothing. I went ahead and left, and they said they would get the other films and compare them. I got a letter in the mail from the hospital two days after that saying that I should repeat my mammogram in 6 months to check for any changes. If they didn't see anything, what changes are they looking for and why am I going back in 6 months instead of a year? I don't make a habit of worrying about things, but I have a very strong family history of cancer. My father died at 60 years old of liver cancer, my aunt at 42 from breast cancer and my sister at 42 of ovarian cancer. I don't want to go to the doctor and them think I'm just looking for something, but at the same time, I don't want something to be let go that might need attention now. If anyone has felt a lump, that felt like a fluid filled cyst, you know smooth and felt like you could kind of make it move, and it couldn't be seen on a mammogram or ultrasound, will you please let me know....and let me know what steps you took or what you found out.  I would appreciate it, thanks so much!
