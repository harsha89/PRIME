If I may offer any advice, it's to get plenty of water in you.  Chemo dehydrates you.  You'll most likely be told also NOT to eat RAW vegetables--due to the pesticide residue. Your tastebuds may be altered--spag sauce tasted like metal to me--I also had the feeling of metal in my mouth.  I was able to feel better once I ate, but if rinsing your mouth out with mouthwash helps--do that.  Don't overdue your normal routine-when you feel tired, fatigue, or whatever get rest. Putting feet up on couch worked best for me For rads, it'll look and feel like a sunburn.  I used Aquaphor ointment to help with the healing process. I also had more fatigue and slight arthritic feeling with rads-and taking an Advil/Ibuprofen is sufficient for this.  You'll also feel the effects of chemo and rads after your done with everything as it'll take awhile for the effect to get out of your system.  Above all I send hugs to my \"sisters\". Hope this advice helped!",

You're right to be angry, scared, fearful, and confused as to where to get information, as it's very overwhelming!! My sister personally found alot of information on this site of breastcancer.org, but she also asked my team of doctors questions, such as how big is tumor, what grade is it, (grade is different from stage and is used to determine how aggressive the cancer is--correct me if I'm wrong anyone).  You've had several tests done already: mammo, x-ray, biopsy, etc.  and from what they see on these tests, the pathology report will come about.  This pathology report will help the doctor to determine what type chemo and/or radiation to give you.  The results of the biopsy which will be before the pathology report will tell the doctor what type of cancer you have, as well as grade, size, and exact location in the breast of tumor.  The grade and size of tumor, and whether or not lymph nodes are affected will determine stage. I would say fight cancer with all your heart and might.  Get all the information you can, don't be afraid to ask questions, most importantly don't assume anything.  Kick this thing right in the bud, tell it where to go, how to get there, and what time to leave.  Also, if need be, get a health care proxy set up, just in case you feel you won't be able to make your own medical decisions. My family had them in place when we admitted our parents to nursing homes, (they're no longer with us), and one is in place for my sister to make my medical decisions.  It can later be revoked after you're better.  Good luck, and let me know how you progress.",

I finished chemo on May 20, and am now into my 2nd week of radiation.  I've had a cough for about 4-5 weeks, and was on a paclitaxel injection for 2nd half of chemo, but it also turns out I was diagnosed with walking pneumonia.  The timing of my cough is interesting with all these circumstances. Good luck!!!",

Everyone's cicumstance is different--with me the doctor told me that even with chemo and rads there's a 10 % chance of cancer reoccurrence in your lifetime. I don't know if that's me personally or everyone who is diagnosed and he  was just generally speaking. Hope this helps!",

I finished chemo 5/20, and in the process of radiation now.  I have a wonderful group of doctors, and anytime you notice anything different with your body mention it to the doctor.  I was on SO many antinausea drugs with chemo that for the most part I did OK.  I had a generic vesion of Kytril if needed, but for the most part felt fatigue and queasy--nothing that soup and crackers couldn't handle. I of course lost my hair-all of it--but didn't have to shave my legs WOOHOO!!! Chemo is cumulative so as you progress in your treatment you'll feel your symptoms more.  If you ladies are able to have something to eat while doing chemo--do it!! I had a lunch provided by the hospital, and it helped me with my nausea. Also, my hydration day was the day after chemo-keep drinking water EVEN AFTER  chemo.  I became dehydrated last week after radiation because I forgot I wasn't getting the hydration I had during chemo.  Also, if any of you are taking taxol for your chemo, you may be given Benadryl intravenously. I had this therapy, and had a jittery/shakiness/shivery feeling from the benadryl. Not the reaction I was supposed to have.  Apparently it was too much for my system, if it works for you fine--if not ask if you can take OVER-THE-COUNTER Benadryl.  I took the over-the-counter type, 1 hour before  chemo, then another one right before the nurses administered chemo--and I slept like a baby!!! Also when you ladies go through radiation--use 100% aloe vera to start when you begin your radiations BEFORE YOU SEE RED.  My sister recommended I do this, and I haven't been feeling my sunburn; I just look burnt. Another thing, as you do your radiation treatments you MAY see black dots/freckles--I did. I asked rad onc about the one I had, and it was a radiation tattoo, so don't be alarmed,  but by all means mention anything and everything you see different on your bodies.  Hope my experience helps you!!",
