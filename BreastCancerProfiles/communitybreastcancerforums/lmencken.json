It's the before part that we need to overcome. I guess I will get my wig on my first treatment and be ready. I guess I'd rather pick a day before the clumps fall..especially if I'm at work! I will need to psych myself up for this though! Let me know how.shaving goes if you guys do it..and who the heck do you get to do it???!!!! Not sure I want my husband doing it!!

Maybe I should have it cut like some of you have if I can. It is a little puffy on top. Kd - so sorry you experienced the hypoatremia again.  There has to be a way you can go right from your infusion to somewhere to monitor you or treat you .. would definitely get another opinion especially as they know it will happen again!!! Glad you have someone to talk to. Sometimes our loved ones try but don't get it and we need more.  It's not crazy at all. They should put a counselor on our team who checks In with us through this journey I think!!!  By the way, your period may be weird.. got mine after my first infusion and was wacky..heavy, then light then regular....lasted longer too!! Smilethru and Makeiki3 - I also struggle with feeding another bugger with my hormones.  I may ask again Thursday when I go for 2nd infusion about taking pills sooner or ovaries out.  My surgeon said that was aggressive but that's what I want to be with this!! GonnaBePos - Yes. its like stages..stage 1 -  getting ready for cutting your hair off.... stage 2 now getting used to NO hair.  I handled the first one ok but now I need to gear up as I see all you ahead of me and what will happen.  I will probably need to get more hats or start loving my wig! I was lucky and during my infusion my nurse coordinator took me over to order a wig from ACS.  I didn't expect that but I didn't even have to call. It was done during my treatment.  Maybe you can contact them online to order...may as well have a spare if you can...especially if one doesn't work out.  Oh and I also had cramping, pain for a week.  Back, knees, hips..it did go away though. ThatFox - venting is normal...and here is best place to do it!! No judging!  One day at a time.  It stinks about work though.. You'd think they should be grateful you are working through while feeling like crap!!!   I hope you are on the upswing soon!!!!  Sending you positive thoughts! Wishing everyone well and sending good vibes to all as every day we are moving closer to our individual finish lines! ",

Seq24 nice how you got your wig styled and glad you have the time to take from work.  Hopefully your running to bathrroom will be short-lived!!! Bagsharon - what's the deal with Clariton? I asked my office's allergist..she had no idea... you really use it for bone pain? CC2016 I hear ya ... not ready for buzz and was going to get it cut short...the beauty school is a good idea... why pay that much for a cut!! Lisbeth...awesome that the Magic Mouthwash worked...I am so nervous about the mouth sores..now I just have to get my MO to prescribe it for me just in case if I can!!  Does yours have Zovirax in it? Smilethru- I feel you - I think I am in denial still about hair.. I am preparing but still doesn't seem like it will happen.  I am so late ordering my wig.. Kids started school this week and I thought I had more time but now I'm a week out.   UGH Leydi - thanks for the pill info.  I just feel like if estrogen is feeding another bugger, then I should remove the estrogen as soon as possible. Mine is 100 percent estrogen too.  70 percent progesterone.  Continued Good Vibes to all!!!  ",

I thought I would be smoothly sailing but bagsharon yout make a good point..I assumed 30 treatments but now I will have to ask. It's hard wondering if you are reducing your secondary cancer chance but increasing a reoccurrance. I still have no body hair but some growth on my head which is great! Hot flashes are terrible!!!! And I haven't even started tne pill yet. I am either too cold or too hot lately!!! Menopause is so fun! ",
