Anyone else faced this situation? One oncologist suggests I do chemo and 2 suggest I do this study. Log in to post a reply",

I am finding that the oncologists (the 2 who recommend the study as opposed to the one who suggested chemo) are more ok with not doing the chemo in my situation than my OB/GYN and internist who's opinions I have also sought. How many opinions are enough? I have gotten 3 now in my area. Is that enough? Thank you everyone who has commented and I wish you the best of health!",

In fact, the 2 MOs that suggested the study to me did not really say no to chemo but said it would be fine if I did not end up in the group doing chemo. However, I can, of course, simply turn down the chemo. Anyone in this situation in the Washington, DC/suburban Maryland area? If so, I would love to compare notes on the doctors I have seen.",
