I was suppose to have a lumpectomy but when they sent me to neucleur just before surgery they saw more areas that were highly suspicious. Had to make the decision five minutes before surgery to have the breast removed. I am still waiting for my oncologist appt. I am from canada so don't know what the normal wait is but I am very anxious waiting. Have called my surgeons office to see if they could get some news but nothing going on. I just feel pretty much alone going through this. My surgery is not healing, horrible pain under the arm still. Is it just me? lol",
