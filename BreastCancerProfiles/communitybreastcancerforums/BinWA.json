I'm 18 months after lumpectomy, chemo, radiation for lobular breast cancer. I was having hip pain so had CT scan and MRI. \"Highly suspicious for bone mets lesion\" turned up on my sacrum. I had a CT guided bone biopsy. Tests came back normal. Do you think this is reliable or could they just have missed the lesion? Thanks,",

Anyway, I posted about a month ago asking if you all thought that the negative results from the bone biopsy on my sacrum was reliable. Well my Docs decided they weren't reliableand called me back for second bone biopsy. I'm waiting for results again. Thanks for the support.",
