    "Content": "rospro wrote: On Nov. 7,2017 I had a modified radical mastectomy on my right side and a simple mastectomy on my left side. (Left side showed normal but I didn't want to face surgery again in the future so I had that removed as well, just in case). Anyway I am one month past surgery and doing well except that on my right side it feels sometimes like there is something loose under the skin below the incision almost like I would imagine a muscle tear to be, if that makes any sense. I am currently doing PT so that I can get range of motion back to be able to reach normally. I did have this sensation before PT so I'm wondering if this is normal. While driving or riding in a car if a bump is hit, it is very uncomfortable. Could it be just because of the extent of the surgery on that side. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.Â  Log in to post a reply",
