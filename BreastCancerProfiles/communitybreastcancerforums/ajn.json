It is not painful and doesn't move, but I do have some discomfort through the right breast and down the arm and side. I have atypical hyperplasia and was put on Tamoxifen 2 years ago. The side affects of the Tamoxifen were so bad that it just knocked me down, so I quit taking it after a few weeks. I had intraductal papiloma 4 years ago, and had the duct removed. That was in the left breast. Then 2 yrs ago I had a lump removed from right breast that was 2cm x 5cm which I was told was not cancer, but then I was contacted by the health dept a few wks later to go back to the doctor immediately to be put on the Tamoxifen. That is when they told me I had atypical hyperplasia. When I questioned the doctor as to why I had to take the tamoxifen if I didn't have cancer his reply was \" you have cells that are rapidly changing into cancer and you need the medicine!\" So, I tried to take it, but unfortunately the side affects were so bad that I just couldn't. I have grandchildren that I am raising and they were taking care of me instead of me taking care of them! So I made the decision that I needed to stop the medicine and take care of my children. And now, here I am 2 yrs later, about to have to go back to the doctor with this new lump. (I guess it is new. I don't know how long it has been there).Â  Log in to post a reply",
