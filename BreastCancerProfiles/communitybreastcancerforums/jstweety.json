I can't take this discomfort pain any more. I am now scheduled to have them removed and replaced with implants. Wondering.... does the pain and discomfort go away once the expanders are removed? How long did it take some of you to recuperate from implant surgery? I am also wondering how my boobs are going to look once the implants go in. Log in to post a reply",
