Also, my insurance, Cigna denied the RO's request for IMRT so I requested an appeal (due to my elevated risk of heart disease) and now I'm freaking out over user error which I guess is less of an issue with conventional 3D because it's less complicated for the technicians. Clearly, I must have radiation and SOON and I'm mentally stuck.  I postponed the treatment because my RO happens to be on vacation this week and the temp RO did not want to get involved in the appeal (and I can't say given his position I blame him). My first thought was do an expedited appeal since apparently Cigna is known to routinely reject IMRT on the first, thinking perhaps they'd approve it on second attempt and if not, I'd just go with traditional.  Now I'm just confused.",

My RO didn't discuss this with me (if she did, I don't recall) nor was the breath holding technique nor any of my other risk factors, treatment for Her2+, diabetes mentioned.I'll ask this when i see her on Monday. thanks everyone",
