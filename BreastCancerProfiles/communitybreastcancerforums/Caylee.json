He didnt mention anything about any other meds, so when I got off the phone - I took one of my anxiety pills. When I had my surgery I didnt have a pump put in either. So what are you telling me the more treatments that are available for my triple positive, the better chance I have from it ever coming back?? I am Stage IIA - T2 NO MO - ER+  PR+  Her2+",

October 10, I will begin with 8 glasses of cold water a day and everyday until I am done. I dont want to die of cancer, so I have to wrap my head around the journey I am about to take.  Hugs to all of you, Caylee ",

Can someone tell me if I am right or wrong - I am in the tripple positive group, I have been told and I have read that being tripple positive is a good thing because it responds to the medicine better, IS that true????",

It took them 5 times to get the iv in, now I have to get a port in, I was wired and couldn't sleep from the decahedron for 3 days, got constipated and I am just soooo exhausted. I drank 50 million cups of water prior to chemo, didn't get nausea or vomit. Muscles are so soar now, can't even walk, no fever though, chemo is NOT for sissys!!!",
