In cold weather I keep a heating pad on my feet.  This summer in 90 degree weather I'd keep a fan on to help with hot flashes and wrap my feet in blankets they got so darn cold.  I did try gabapentin/neurontin.  Got rid of the hot flashes and did nothing for my neuropathy.  Gained a lot of weight.  My Onc had me wean off and I've very slowly but surely lost weight since going off of it. The only thing that helped me was finding a chronic pain specialist who has a lot of experience with neuropathy.  I really feel like he helped me get my life back. I think accupuncture helped a bit too, but, the chronic pain guy is my hero when it comes to how I feel.  We're about 4 hrs from Chicago, there has got to be someone in Chicago who can help, but, PM me if you ever want the name.  Good luck.  Neuropathy is the pitts.

      "Content": "Dec 27, 2008 05:49AM ktym wrote: Good luck to you.  I'm recuperating from my mastectomy and sentinel node (although a lot of nodes came out) and expander right now, so I'm feeling for you and will be thinking of you.  Some of my advice may be different.  My PS and I disagreed, but she gave in, and I came home same day of surgery.  Best decision I made. As far as I'm concerned, all hospitals have to offer is germs, lack of privacy, and inability to sleep undisturbed.  However, if you get admitted, the advice of shorts under the hospital gown is a good one. So my pointers: 1) Cook and freeze away food and dinners now that can pop in the microwave easily.  I washed and cut up lettuce ahead of time so salad was already mixed and ready.  If you buy milk/pop/juice in big containers, and won't have someone  around all of the time to pour for you, pour them and set them aside in smaller containers that are low weight and easy to hold and maneuver with drains in and when you're not moving around well after surgery. Remember, a gallon of milk is around 9 lbs, most surgeons won't let you lift that much post op--and it will seem heavier to you than that.  2) The advice above about drains was good.  Keep them low, keep them emptied.  No one will care for them as well as you do--even in the hospital if you stay.   The biggest mistake people make in the first couple of days is thinking if the drainage is low its good because the drain will come out sooner. No--it means its clogging.  Learn to milk it a lot and make sure it is always patent.  In the long run it will stay in less, or you'll have less problems with seromas after it comes out.  Don't be worried when after a few days it starts getting clots or more tissue looking stuff is coming out.  Just means that pocket is closing down and less fluid is building up--that's a good thing--you're healing and you're on the home stretch with the thing.  3) The advice about clothes for after is good.  I'd add to that and say buy them bigger then you need.  Pulling up sweats or pajama bottoms starts to wear on your poor muscles post op.  Make it easy on yourself and buy loose things and tops with big arm holes that make it easy to dress and undress.  Also, if you have heavy drawers in your bedroom furniture like I do, then put the clothes out ahead of time or take the drawer out and put it on the floor.  Yikes, the first time I pulled that drawer out to get out clean undies I cursed my short sightedness!  4) Pain meds.  Keeping up with pain immediately post op means you'll use less in the long run.  Almost all hospitals are set up so that you have to ask for meds.  DON'T BE SHY.  If you need antinausea meds to tolerate the pain meds ask for those too.  Forget that \"what's your pain on a scale of 1-10\" business.  Take them by the clock the first day.  When you have a good day and you took them every 4 or 6 hrs the day before, then go to 6 or 8 the next day.  When you have a good 24 hrs that way, then decrease the next.  After about 4 days of that then just go to when you need them.  Everyone is different, but this has always worked best for me, for others maybe it won't.  But, that would be my best advice.  Oh yeah, keep them and a bottle/glass of water in easy reach at night.   5) Practice now in how you'll get around post op.  The advice about the sponge bath above was good.  I preferred getting in the shower and using a hand held from the waist down and sponge above.  My PS warned that a lot of people have trouble getting in and out of the tub, so although sitting in a small amount of water was ok, the getting in and out was a problem for most.  My drains out and I can shower now, but still keep a sturdy plastic stool in the shower.  I get tired easy and find balancing to shave etc can still be a problem and you don't want to take the chance of falling and grabbing with a hand you shouldn't be doing that with.  So, the little things like, reaching towels when you get out, getting in and out of the tub, getting in and out of chairs and beds can be harder then you think.  I'd take some time to move around and think of what it will be like when you can't push, pull, or lift hard.  We did find we needed to move some furniture around to make things easier. Hope it helps and doesn't just scare you.  You can get through this. I've found this forum invaluable to me--just knowing others are going through it too helps.   ",

I would personally advise being careful about telling a lot of people very soon when you know so little.  Cancer is like pregnancy, everyone is sure they know what you should be doing and for some reason aren't afraid to tell you about it.  They can also be very indiscrete in what they say which is painful during these first few weeks of coping.  There is a reason for the thread on this site that says \"Worst Thing Someone Said to You.\"  Tell those closest to you that you'll need support from.  Then give you and your husband some time to cope and find out more Wednesday, and then tell people.  Give yourself some time for the initial shocck to wear off first.  These next weeks are the hardest, waiting for pathology, finding out what the final plan will be, the waiting is hard. You have a lot of people here to support you.  You can get through this.  ",

Smile, during treatment I buzzed down a couple of times to even things out, looked too scraggly.  When treatment stopped I decided to hold out and see what happened.  At about 8 weeks I had several different sizes of sprouts and thought I'd wait and buzz to an even length just before a big event I have in a couple of weeks.  All of a sudden the last few days its all evening out, like the long hairs waited for the short to catch up or something.  So, for now I'm sitting tight and letting it do its own thing, it seems to know what its doing better then I do.  Of course my hair has ALWAYS had a mind of its own.  I will say that part of the rapid growth right now I wonder if it would have happened if I'd been on Tamox.  I was due to start, then needed to hold for surgery.  So, I've had a few extra weeks of letting it grow that normally may have been getting hit by the Tamox",

Plus, if people bring you food they tend to bring casseroles etc that carry and keep well that have more starch.  One of the other hidden dangers is fluids.  We try to keep so hydrated and as your sense of taste changes it gets harder for some people to find fluids they like and can drink a lot of.  Many of the sport drinks have a lot of calories, and I found the calories in the juice that I added to the water to make it taste better really added up by the end of the day. She told me to exercise every day, and I did, even if it was just a few minutes of walking on really bad days.  On good days I excercised as much as my legs would let me. She also said to weigh yourself every single day and make no excuses.  Don't say \"well I ate a lot of salty things yesterday\", but weigh yourself every day and pay attention to what the scale says.  I can tell you that I think some of what she said about diet is true, but its not all of it.  The steroids and everything else meant my appetite and sense of thirst were off--I couldn't trust them.  So, I counted calories and used that instead of hunger pains.   I don't want to depress or tick off anyone who doesn't like her advice.   I know a lot of women decide to get through this however they can and worry about the weight afterwards.  However, I really was worried about it and not gaining weight was a big priority for me and thought I'd pass it on when I saw your post because it really helped me.  ",

Also for me the neuropathy has meant muscle weakness.  It is slightly better, but no where near what I could do previously",

I was so scared of my diagnosis and risk at the time that I jumped on chemo.  If I'm around and disease free 20 years from now will I change my tune?  Maybe, maybe seeing all those years and kids growing and grandkids coming and time with DH will allow me to put things in perspective and be glad I took the best shot at those years.  I just sure hope I don't spend them all feeling like this.  Edited to add: It has been 2 years since chemo ended, even my always optimistic Onc has stopped saying there is a chance the neuropathy could improve",

The fact that flying is optional is not the point.  I saw a great you tube video of a t-shirt a radio announcer wore through security Wed.

I'm never sure when to start the count down to trying to feel better, from the last chemo (4 weeks), or when I got out of the hospital after the last chemo (2 1/2 weeks).  But, I swear I can see a few hair follicles sitting under the skin--not growing--but the color is there.   The frustration is in how long I'm being told it will take to recuperate from that nice little chemo induced ICU visit.  I had pictured bouncing back within a few weeks and life being a little more normal.  I'm now hearing the words months, and you're expecting too much too fast.  Oh, well, I guess I just have to remember those words \"you almost died\" and being grateful I'm home and stop concentrating on how much I can't do yet.  Anyone else finding that the little aggravations in life just don't bother them the way they used to?  I find myself ignoring things that used to annoy me.  Just don't have the energy to worry about them, too much else going on.  I'm hoping I can remember that place and keep that tendency when life gets back to more normal.  ",

I couldn't go through chemo again so worry about that decision. (even though I know it is more likely to recur in the same breast then it is to get a new primary in the other breast).   I am happy with my decision and would not have been happy with a completely numb chest.   However, I had an expander and then implant.  With the DIEP's, TRAM's etc. you get one shot at things.  They can't do the procedure again if you get something in the other breast, I do think that changes the equation a little. Can you get numbers from your BS or Onc or someone regarding your risk of recurrence vs. risk of getting something in the other breast? It may help with the decision.",

No more waking up from a breast biopsy with a radical mastectomy.  You'll have to bring the corn, love it.  Hope it works out and down the road we can all get there and meet one another in person and enjoy our feast. ",

I'm finding that staying off the boards except for quick trips in, and doing even that much less often is healthier.  Seems like a lot of us in our chemo group are doing that. I don't think it is good to let BC take over a portion of your every day, and the computer and the  boards make it a little too easy for me to do that.  I try to look and take a turn at helping newbies sometime, but, otherwise breaking that habit has been good for me.  If I come in,  I check in here and with the thread about exercise and reading--then close out the page for a time. Well, do get a lot of help on the LE thread still, but, I am so trying hard to keep my focus on enjoying today and making BC a past event that is only that--the past.",

If you can keep more then one toothbrush and keep washing it out and letting it dry completely before using it again.  Make sure that you're brushing your tongue. Be careful about not reusing water bottles etc while going through it.  I found it kept it under control but didn't completely keep it away, the steroids just whack the immune system down for some of us.  Also at the risk of TMI.  If you're also having trouble with yeast in other areas, you will need diflucan to get it under control. For me it helped that but not the thrush Hope it helps, good luck ",

I remember when she was diagnosed, and when it came back such a short time later.  Remember when her son went to Iraq.  I didn't find out she had died until a couple of weeks later.  I think my Mom and Sister didn't want to tell me because it would upset me, but it came up because they were afraid my neice and nephew would say something.  Of course, the neice and nephew we've been trying to be honest with (remember the ones I told you about I love so much, and had it reinforced again because they were so completely unfazed by my lack of hair) wanted to know if it could happen to me and we had to be honest and say yes, but we hope not and no sign of it yet and I was on this great med tamoxifen to help keep it from coming back.  Wow, did my DH have to put up with a crying spell that night.  Then found out this AM that another friend of  my SIL just died from metastatic melanoma.  I had only met her a few times, but was so touched when in the midst of her own crisis she took the time to ask my SIL everytime she saw her about how I was doing.  Been a little hard to remain up beat this week.  Especially with cold and grey and rainy weather here.  Hope the increased funding to the NIH keeps up and we make some progress these next few years with these stinkin diseases. ",

I think you're right, the fear and lack of knowing limitations is so hard right now.  When I look on some of the other threads, those that have been dealing with it longer seem to be doing better, I think its because they know.  One woman once said, yep, raked leaves yesterday, swollen today.  Hopefully you'll be back golfing and know what that does and how to treat it (or better yet it doesn't worsen anything), and getting back that piece of your life that is so important to you will be a huge boost.  For me it has been continuing yoga and some careful weight lifting (the jogging/walking doesn't aggravate it).  Knowing I can continue that and it doesnt' seem so far to trigger or worsen things has been wonderful.  It is long hours of repetative movements that seem to get to me.  When I can't rest my arm and know I need to.  This last bout had me pulling back  and was a killer.   Most of the time I'm luckier then most dealing with this and I know it.  Have to keep that in mind.   Good morning to all you jewels, hope everyone is having a relaxing and wonderful weekend. ",

Been under the weather.  I swear someone can walk by my office with something and I catch it.  I think I'm as immunosuppressed as last winter, but this winter I'm out into the world and not secluding myself.  You know what, I think its worth it.  Had to shut off another thread, read someone telling a newbie that their neuropathy would go away as soon as they stopped chemo.  Mine didn't, and Onc saying I may get some back, but at a year out you have to accept that it may not.  That's fine.  I've adapted what I do, adapted my work, and I'd do it all over again for the chance to live this life.  Just hate to have someone go into this not realizing the risks and being falsely reassured.  Yes, most have their neuropathy go away, just don't get how someone could be so sure of what is so unsure. Don't know about you guys but I do find myself going for days at a time kind of forgetting.  I'm still dealing with SE's so can't completely, but really, yeah, on some level I forget for periods of time that BC ever happened.   It's a wonderful feeling. ",

I can tell you that many weeks later I'm still very weak and SOB and have trouble getting up and down stairs, and still have reduced kidney function,  and they tell me to expect many more weeks of recovery, which tells me that another round of chemo may have done me in as badly as they were afraid it would.  In the middle of the night I worry about recurrence and will always worry about what if that last round, or doing a few taxol to top things off would have made the difference--should I have pushed for it.   You know we all gear each other up and encourage each other to push through no matter what, that I felt like a failure for having to quit.  Then, I realized that was as ridiculous as women I know that felt like they failed for taking meds during labor, or needing a C-section, and not having \"natural child birth\".  This isn't a torture contest, its about doing what's going to keep us healthiest.  My onc told me many oncologists have the same problem, they feel like they've failed us if they don't get us through the whole treatment plan, and it can be just as hard for them to step back and say enough is enough. I can't tell you the right thing to do, I can tell you I understand how hard a decision it is to make.  Right now I feel deep down that what my body needed at that point was to heal and recover and I'm happy my Onc stopped, and she told me she has learned to trust that instinct in her patients.  So, my only advice is to give yourself some time right now to recuperate and enjoy being at home, don't let those middle of the night fears run away with your logic and instincts, and then trust that you and your Onc will make the best decision for you.  Best wishes",

Most expensive one I ever took)  I listened to the advice of not letting yourself get distracted--one task at a time only.  And lots of notes and wrote down what to do each day and prioritize.  And have someone double check anything important.  Also fatigue, when you're tired you can't break through the chemo brain fog.  Just go home.  I'm back taking more meds at night to sleep--reminds me of being on chemo again yeechhh-but without sleep can't function at work the next day.  The first day I sat at my desk and felt overwhelmed and unable to function, but it got better.  I can honestly say that I think the regimen and structure at work and the need to think and use my brain muscles seems to be helping my chemo brain get a little better.  One piece of advice from someone who has been there.  If you're like me, the hot flashes started in about 30 days into the Tamox, sweating profusely non stop at work doesn't help chemo brain, neither does not sleeping at night because they wake you up.  Don't be afraid to ask for effexor or neurontin or something.  They started me on neurontin to help with the neuropathy too.  As far as I'm concerned that drug is a wonder drug.   Finally at the point everyone says oh you cut your hair short, instead of staring at me like I'm a mutant.  Just smile and say yes.  Want to say, are you kidding me?  Ya think I cut my hair this short and shaved off anything resembling bangs on purpose?  Oh yeah, and gave myself a perm like it was the 70's and encourage it to curl over my ears because that's the spot that seems to want to grow the fastest.  Heck yeah I spent thousands of money out of pocket for this beautiful doo.  But I don't say it, just smile and nod.   ",

I think we do have to spend that time alone, because I've found that even my closest friends and family just can't think about it returning, don't want to hear about it, and sometimes we do have to deal with that possibility.  Not dwell on it maybe, but be allowed to think about it and deal with it.  Where that line gets drawn between wallowing and dwelling and dealing and accepting sure seems to be different for me then it is for others. My Onc warned me not to get my eyes checked until after chemo and into tamox because things change so much. Couldn't take it anymore and went in.  My eye doc was amazed at how my script had changed.  I was amazed at how much better I can see with the new contacts. Wish I'd gone in sooner",

Said Yoga isn't about form, it is about the experience and breathing, connecting to self, and enjoying the movement.  Found that to be such a freeing thing.  To be connecting to self and meditating and not worrying about how straight my legs and arms are when I'm doing it. I would think with the work you've put into Reiki that you'd be very good at yoga.

Hear you on the down moods lately.  I don't think the tamox helps.  In my case, I think what is getting to me is the realization of this is it.  I may get some improvement back, but this many months out this myopathy and neuropathy may be permanent.  The back pain is with me since the chemopause and tamox.  Its the myopathy and how much it hurts to just get up and put weight on my feet in the morning and how hard it is to dial a cell phone still that just eats at me all the time.  The thought of this being permanent residual from my treatment and I'll be living with it is really getting me down I think. I told my Onc that if I had been able to look into the future and see that this is what I would see in the mirror and this is how I would feel after treatment I don't think I could have gone through with it.  I want that life back, I want to feel how I used to feel (and I'm not just talking about the constant worry of recurrence) and I'll likely never feel that way again.   I'm counting from time of diagnosis.  That's what our group uses, and adding in those few months and getting a higher number for how long I've been a survivor sounds better to me. ",

Have to say on a short vacation right now.  Rested.  Because I've been off my feet for a few days they hurt less.  The rest of the aches and pains and the frustration of dealing with the hand neuropathy and balance etc all seem so much easier when I'm rested and the pain is less and I'm not under pressure to be doing so much. Amazing what not having shooting neuropathy pains every time you move and stand on your feet, and you move and stand on your feet for 12-14 hrs at a stretch, can do for your outlook on life. ",

They put you into groups based on path, age, perhaps oncotype, any other illnesses you may have, and make an estimate to chemo benefit based on what group you best fit into.  I was told, if we tell you that you have a 5% benefit from chemo, you need to understand that if we give it to 100 people in that group, 95 of them will not benefit and 5 people will.  I was a little taken aback on a recent thread about someone's decision to do chemo or not to see so many posts telling the person that started the thread that chemo wasn't easy but so doable and over quickly and advising her to go ahead.  A few even told her that it was  easy.  I just stayed out of it, but it bothers me to see such one sided  responses.  Chemo isn't easy for most I've talked to or who were in my group, and ended up very hard and potentially life threatening for a few.  There are many articles coming out now about the long term side effects from breast cancer treatment.  Something maybe we don't hear about because until recently not much attention was paid to it.  But, if you start digging, \"chemo brain\" can last up to 10 years, neuropathy and cardiac effects for some may not ever go away (yes, I know, for most it will) late effects like leukemia are possible.  Don't get me wrong, I made the decision to do chemo for a benefit maybe some wouldn't have taken a chance on, and even knowing that they can't reassure me that all the SE's will resolve, I'd do it again.  I just think the chemo discussion can be very one sided on these boards and I think we're often hard on those that rightly step back and question taking it.  So, you really struck a cord in me AlaskaAngel with how you phrased things in your posting.  And at the risk of doubling the angry posts and PM's I've probably already generated, I do agree that anyone willing to go through the significant risk it takes to do chemo, really should be willing to make the life style modifications that are now recommended to us, and I'm always shocked to see it otherwise at times.",

The good thing about the chemo hitting so hard and even walking up and down stairs being a major effort and making me short of breath is that I just don't have the energy to look in the mirror much.  Lucky for me my DH thinks I'm cute like this and loves the hats, so I think I'll stick to listening to how he thinks I look and stop looking in the mirror. ",

T The bisphosphonate discussion has been good for all of us as far as hearing different opinions.   It does so end up being an individual decision.  ddlat, get what you're saying, 35% risk reduction, if your risk of recurrence is under 5%, ends up being a risk reduction of less then 2%--less then the risk of many of the side effects.  For those with a higher risk of recurrence the numbers may be much different.  Ended up being a mute issue in my case because my nephrologist nixed the idea since my kidneys took such a hit from the chemo and the aftermath.  Best wishes to everyone, hugs to those needing it right now, and to everyone hope your weather is better then the rainy, windy, grey 40 degrees we have here today.  ",

I know the time spent in chemo is less then hormonal therapy, but when you look at the data, hormonal therapy has less side effects and will give more benefit.  Is this just a fluke of the cross section of people who post on this board?  ",

I mean, wow.  So, the mmg and USN looked good. My poor breast (implant at time of exchange on the other side because they dont' make anything as small as my natural breast : ) )  just a couple of months since surgery and it was squished and squished today. At one point I felt that incision pulling and thought, well, guess we'll be testing how well that incision is healed.  But, it was worth it.  The scans all looked good and with all that manipulation the discharge came out of 2 ducts instead of the one I had found it in.  So, we're just monitoring for now since the chances of it being anything are so low.  So, I am doing the happy dance tonight.  Breast Cancer has turned me into a nervous nellie. A year ago I would have been so calm and questioning whether even the scans needed to be done.  Today, walked around with ativan in my pocket ready to take it at a moment's notice. I really hate that I am like that now.  Maybe it goes away with time? I can't thank all of you enough for the well wishes.  When this happened I was right on the computer and DH knew exactly what I was doing.   Ladyjane: I so get what you're saying.  I seriously drove my Onc nuts asking when will it get better why don't I feel better yet are you sure it will get better you said I wouldn't feel so bad so are you sure you're sure now....        It will get better but I swear no one warns us ahead of time how long it will take.  Maybe we cant' take it up front.  You need to be able to think it'll be over in 6 months, when all that means is the infusions are over and the chemo gift is the gift that keeps on giving long after you and the insurance company have given your last dollar. I think the worst part for me was wondering if they all were right and worrying that it wouldn't get better.  If I had known how much better I would feel in 4 months I would have been much more patient the first 2.  So, try, try, to give yourself some time. ",

I tell you, my myopathy is slowly getting better, and I'm learning how to compensate for the neuropathy, but getting so tired of my feet hurting all the time.  Plus, the fatigue is the same.  That's what I have a hard time getting across to people. Parts of me are getting better, but the fatigure is the same as if I'm still going through it. Sure makes getting a normal life back in a struggle.  I'll take today over a few months ago anyday though.  Had the wierdest thing happen this week.  DH mentioned a food I ate a lot during chemo but not before or since. He mentioned it and I pictured it in my head and just started gagging.  Guess some memories will be hard to bury. Oh well, at least the sun is shining today, time to get off to work...hope you all have a great day",

So, last week I'm asking PS who I should go to if I change my mind, or more importantly, what if I get a recurrence or a new cancer on the other side.  That's my real worry.  What if I need more surgery or radiation and need a PS again.  So I said \"who do you recommend I go to if I get another cancer or have a chest wall recurrence.\"  I get back \"ohh, thats not going to happen.\"  I just wanted to scream \"what about my chart haven't you read, what about breast cancer did you not learn when doing reconstruction all these years.\"  Still raises my blood pressure when I think about it.

Out of desperation we found a website on thrush in breastfeeding babies where the issue is mom and baby passing it back and forth and they recommended 1/2 strength vinegar for cleaning.  So, I ended up using 2 different toothbrushes.  I washed each brush in 1/2 strength vinegar after brushing (rinse it good afterwards in plain water to get the taste out), and alternated brushes so the one I was using had had a chance to air dry completely before using it again.  It didn't keep it away, but seemed to shorten how long I had it.",

Shay, everyone is so different it is hard to know. Chemo brain as you know happens to those who haven't had chemo too. I've found fatigue makes it worse so sleeping as best you can may help. The neuropathy actually got worse for me steadily as I went through and then for the next few months after I finished TC, which is not uncommon.  According to my Onc neuropathy is less common on TC then some of the other regimens so hoping for you that you are in the majority and don't experience it. It did find that exercise and particularly yoga helped my body learn to compensate for some of the issues that the neuropathy caused.  Yoga really helped with the taxotere aches and pains too. ",

If its keeping you awake at night ask them to biopsy it, if its not and you have a lot of trust in them, follow the advise of what they want to do.",

Dry and watery eyes, some mild GI and eye changes that I've adjusted to so well  I forget about htem.  Chemo brain improving still.  Fatigue is stil an issue.  The neuropathy is the worst, it has forced some career changes. ",
