I was on Avastin with Xeloda for 7 months last year.  I would only get the Avastin once every three weeks.  I would feel great after getting it.  After the third month, WHAM! my blood pressure went sky high (145/105).  The one good thing I always had was good BP readings, so this was a surprise.  I didn't feel anything, but the pressure was high enough to warrant going on BP medicine.   After we determined the Xeloda wasn't working, they took me off Avastin and I also went off the BP medicine.  My blood pressure returned to normal.  I was very leerie of taking the bp medicine because you hear about so many side effects, but I was on a low dose med, (Diovan 60) and it got my bp back in line.  I would take the medicine at night and didn't really notice any side effects.  Like I said, now I'm not on Avastin any more. I have just started Doxil and have been hoping for the best.  If your doc recommends going on BP medicine, don't fight it.   My GP explained to me that even with good diet and exercise, if your BP is being raised unnaturally due to the chemo med, trying to lower it naturally would be difficult. So, I went on the BP medicine rather than chance a stoke or worse.  I hope you get everything under control and best of luck with your treatment. Hope this info helps. take care, Kim",

Otherwise, I don't really have any side effects yet to speak of.  I'm waiting for Day 10 to see if the fatigue kicks in, but truthfully, right now, I feel better than I have since July.  My pain is down considerably and I can actually sleep on my sides now and not just flat on my back.   Last week I even joined the local gym to start walking on the treadmill.  I feel peppier than I have in months. Something else I've been doing is starting to drink a lot of green tea.  I don't buy the sugary, bottle stuff.  I buy decaffienated green tea bags.  Fill my tea pot, bring to boil and add about 4-5 bags.  I let it steep and cool down then add it to a pitcher with some honey for sweetness.   I've always know green tea to be good for you, but I'm now drinking it daily.  I've also kicked up my diet with lots of veggies.  I don't get crazy with buying only organic, or fresh, etc.  I buy what is on sale, fresh or frozen and make sure I eat 3-4 servings for day. All in all, if I can get a good result from the Doxil, it doesn't seem to be so bad for now.  I can deal with only getting chemo and blood work, once per month as opposed to weekly when I was on taxotere.   Oh, and I get Zometa too to keep my bones strong and prevent chest fractures.  I'm going for new CT scans in about two weeks for restaging.  I'm anticipating some good news from this doxil.  Plus, maybe the green tea, the diet change and a little exercise is helping too. I hope you have a good result with Doxil.   Stay strong, be positive. Good luck, Kim ",

I'm feeling strong.  I'm feeling positive.  This is a refreshing change from living in pain, worry, fear and anxiety for the last 2 yrs.   Something has changed inside of me--for the good!.  For the last two years, I've thought of my body and by cancer as two different entities.  The cancer, an unwanted squatter, living inside me with my body fighting to get rid of it.  As of now,  I feel like its packing its bags and moving out. This sounds weird, but its the only way I can describe it to my family.   Psychologically, I'm resolved to be rid of this disease - non negotiable.  I now feel a little more comfortable talking about the future and making some plans.     To PJB--I just received my 5th round of Doxil--been on it since late Sept.  HFS started to manifest with the 3rd cycle, but came on very strong by my 4th.  Dosage reduction was due to the SE's, along with improved scans.    Again, thank you all!  I'm feeling so pumped right now...LET'S KICK THE SH*T OUT OF THIS DISEASE!  (Fist Pump, Fist Pump, Fist Pump!)     ",
