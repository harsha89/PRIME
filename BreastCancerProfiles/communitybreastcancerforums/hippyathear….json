Results from test of the discharge has showed red blood cells, but no cancerous cells. they now think its a papilloma, so have to go for an op to remove the duct and then do tests on that to see if it is cancerous and also to see if they've removed the right one which hopefully will stop the symptoms.Â  feel a bit better as I've had all these tests and nothing has been found, so hoping after the op they'll confirm that. trying not to worry but is difficult. hope this might help others who have had the same symptoms and are worried too..x",
