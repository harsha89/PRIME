I'm a bit lost and would love your advice. 1.We're waiting for the MRI results to find out whether she needs \"whole brain radiation\" or focused sessions. What about cyberknife? anyone done that ? I read that this has fewer side effects but this costs a lot more. ( the regular rediation sessions are within our insurance) 2. The doctor wants her to start Navelbine transfusions.This is her second line in chemo.what is you experience with it? do you think something better is available? 3. CTC chemosensitivity test - http://www.rgcc-uk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/CST-doctor-info.pdf of course, very costly, but our doctor ( as usual ) disregards it ( not enough evidence). Has anyone done it? Did it contribute to finding the right treatment? Is biopsy still a better option? 4. When is it the right time to start researching about the big cancer centers? MD Anderson and such. I need recommendations. We're from Israel. Thank you:) talking to other patients is the only way to get the real picture.

Right now my mom's stopped eating anything other than Ensure. She is very weak and has jaundice.  One disgusting Oncologist told us that there are no other options other than Carbo and Gemzar(because most chemos dissolve in the liver and if it doesn't function properly they will remain in the body) and that he wouldn't have even prescribed them. A doctor who doesn't believe in his own practice. I ask for your advice. What should we do next? try checking local liver treatments? try to handle it naturally ( milk thistle and tumeric until things stable and then another chemo) Need your help!

I think you should always investigate,mainly while feeling OK, because that's when most trials will accept you. right now PD-033291 ,micro rna and PD-1 look very interesting.
