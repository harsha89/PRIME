I have an appointment with my gynecologist in 2 days (Thursday), but I've been reading here a bit (the reason why I called to make the appointment so thank y'all for that!) and I just felt compelled to post for whatever peace of mind I can find. A few days ago during my monthly self exam I noticed that the hard boney/cartilage (anatomy is not my strong suit) under and to the inside of my breasts is different on each side. The area on my right side is noticeably thicker and denser when palpated, there's no definable mass but there is definitely something hard that's different from the other side. I also found a small pea sized lump under my areola. It's hard, painless, and from what I can tell immobile. It feels to be attached or related to the tissue underneath the skin as I can move the nipple around and the lump stays in the same spot; I can feel it through \"normal\" skin when I move the nipple to the side it that makes any sense. It seems smooth and round-ish and I can't feel the bottom. Probably a normal thing but I'll mention it anyway: that same nipple doesn't get as erect as the other, but it's not inverted. I haven't had any discharge. I'm a 21 y/o white female. I was diagnosed with cutaneous mastocytosis when I was an infant and spent the first part of summer ruling out systemic mastocytosis. My lesions have improved after puberty but I am still symptomatic daily. The bone marrow biopsy came back normal which is great news (that was in May). I have a fainting issue that has been ever-present since I was a toddler. I was diagnosed with POTS and also experience vasovagal syncope from physical and emotional stimuli (despite my best efforts to stay upright haha!). I have also lost about 25lbs since June, though I needed to because I had gained from recuperating from hip surgery. I had a small benign fatty tumor (as it was described to me) in high school that went away. I also was on birth control for about 4 years (due to heavy, irregular, and painful periods) until I got my copper IUD this January. Things were going great until I got my period this september and it just never went away. It's now december and I've had either menstrual bleeding or breakthrough bleeding the entire time. A month ago my doctor prescribed me naproxen to try to stop it, antibiotics were first choice but my stomach is easily upset and I've had too many antibiotic rounds to count at this point. Naproxen didn't work so now I'm on a round of antibiotics as a final resort before removing the IUD. This doctor is new (started seeing her in October) and has not done any type of testing outside of a pelvic exam and ultrasound of my cervix. I have a feeling that the lump may be due to hormonal stuff but it's hard and stationary. I'm only 21 and I know that the odds are in my favor, but I just can't get it out of my mind. When I faint I often injure myself so random lumps/bumps are normal but this just gave me an instant panic. I can't shake this (probably way over dramatic and un needed) impending doom feeling. At first I thought that I just wasn't familiar with my body after losing so much weight (I'm 5'5\"), but there is definitely something out of the ordinary. Anyway, thanks for listening. Any and all input is appreciated. Hugs to all <3 Log in to post a reply",

I have a final exam tomorrow that will determine if I pass a class or not and it's right before my appointment with the gyn. Honestly, I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to focus. I just can't stop thinking.",
