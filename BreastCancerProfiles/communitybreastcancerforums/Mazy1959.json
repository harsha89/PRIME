Aromasin (Exemestane) caused me to toss my cookies exactly 3 hours after I took everyday for a month. My onc put me on  Promethezine and it has worked for me 5 yrs now but there are several others worth trying. When I was on chemo I took Kytril and it worked very well. I hope this gets better for you soon. Hugs, Mazy",

Cancer changed my life too. I also had to give up my career and am limited physically. I get tired and worn out far too fast, cant run, jump or go for long walks. At first, I was saddened but accepting. I didnt cry all the time or anything but it was a huge life change. BUT.....Aside of all that, I have always been grateful to be alive and able to walk and be with my grandkids. I do pretty good for someone with stage 4 bone mets. The nerve damage gives me the most probs. I guess what I'm saying is that you need to look for what you still have. My silver lining is that I'm alive and can walk. For a few months we werent sure that my vertebrae would hold up and one wrong fall could've paralyzed me. Because of the tumor location, if treatment didnt start working as expected..it woulda spread to my organs within 6 months according to my oncs.I'm alive and living as much as I possibly can with my limitations. I've replaced many physical activities with crochet, reading and sewing etc. So maybe sit back, think of all you have and all you can do. Dont ponder too long on the what ifs...just enjoy each day to the fullest. Like Frapp said...get in and roll in it awhile. But then do your best to push it aside and do your living.

But after reading all that you take...I think I am a light weight. I am so sorry you are in that much pain, it has to be awful. I take 30 mg Oxycontin & Flexeril 3 times daily and add naproxen or tylenol if needed and I have oxycodone but I avoid taking that cause it knocks me out. I do still have pain but if I took enuff meds to make it all go away, I would be asleep all the time. I have days when I do too much that the pain is unbearable. I use a heating pad and prop my feet up. I sleep in a cushy recliner. Have you ever tried a pain pump? They've been trying to get enuff docs here willing to manage them. Right now  I could have one but would have to drive at least 2 hrs if I have probs with it etc. Thats not always doable for me. I also had a Kyphoplasty surgery (inject bone cement into vertbrae). Is there any surgery they have offered you? I hope things get better for you, Hugs, Mazy",

You are Er pos and Her2 pos....have you taken any treatement for it? I was diagnosed with my first bone met in 2006 and Aromasin and Zometa took care of that for 5 yrs. Aromasin stopped working and now just a few months ago I was diagnosed with extenisve bone marrow mets throughout my lumbar spine, sacrum, hips, pelvis and right femur. So now Im on Faslodex that seems to be working. My deep pain is nearly gone. My Mo and RO were quite up front with me on the life expectancy thing. I only asked if I should get \"things\" in order. They told me I might live 2 months or 20 yrs. They didnt really know how long these drugs were going to work for me etc  It all depended on how i respond to treatment and if whether or not we can keep it in the bones and out of vital organs. They did agree that all the stats said I had 2-3 yrs.  That was 5 yrs and 7 months ago. So I have defied the odds but I now have alot more cancer to get rid of. Getting 5 yrs out of Aromasin is very good and I hope Faslodex is just as effective.  I do know that there are many ladies who get liver mets under control. Im thinking you should get a second opinion. I certainly would if my onc said I had 6-12 months.  Hopefully someone will post some good advice for you who is familiar with liver mets. Hugs, Mazy",

I have been stage 4 for almost 5 yrs. I first had stage 2B 8 yrs ago. Have faith in the treatments and fight with all your might. I suffered pretty bad for about 6 months and then it gradually started getting better. Now my cancer is considered inactive and has been for quite awhile. I have nerve damage that has changed my life but I decided instead of feeling sorry for myself that I was gonna adjust my life to match my capabilities. I couldnt work anymore after working 65 hrs plus a week. So sitting around bout drove me nutty LOL. I taught myself to crochet, caught up on reading, called and talked to old friends etc. And...I found this site. This site has been the best ever since march 2007 when I first stumbled on it.

True story.....When I was diagnosed with bone mets nearly 4 yrs ago, I considered going to the breast cancer support group at our cancer center. I knew a lady who was going and asked about the time etc for the meetings. A couple days later she called and told me that she felt bad about it but that all the members in that group were stage 0-3 and they feared I would take away the hope of those earlier stage ladies. I was everything they feared. The lady told me straight up that if I came she and 2 others would not come for sure. Then the rest of the conversation was her stumbling all over herself trying to make me believe that she cared so much about me. So there was no reason to go to the meetings knowing I wouldnt get support and wasnt welcome. I never inquired again for fear of hearing the same thing again. No one wants to hear about us or have any idea how much we fight and suffer. If it cant be sugar coated they dont want to see it. Thx for letting me vent too LOL...Hugs, Mazy",

I do not agree with her belief that diet can cure us because I know too many people who are life long vegetarians etc and still got cancer. And I agree we each are entitled to believe what we choose and use whatever treatment we want for whatever the reason. If Fairyfloss's intentions were to truly educate ... then I do feel that we are obligated to reciprocate and offer our knowledge to her as well. So in the spirit of sharing info I am offering my knowledge.... Fairy, I appreciate your concern for your fellow man. I too share a general caring and concern for my sisters here on this board and on this site. For those who had success with the diet cure, I am happy for you. I do not knock eating healthy, etc. And certainly eating healthier is good for anyone. But I hope that some newly diagnosed person who sees your post, doesnt decide to forego medical treatment, surgery etc and assume that your information is for everyone. There are thousands of so called \"cancer cures\" out there and the \"diet\" to which you are referring has long been a topic of discussion. It is nothing new. As for our treatments causing our cancer....maybe in some cases it doesnt work as planned. For myself, without the many drugs I consume...I would have been long dead by now without them. No diet in the world could have stopped the monster I had in my back from spreading to my vital organs. Doctors guessed at perhaps a few months before it would have taken me over. Because of this.........I DO NOT want some other new person who has recently been diagnosed stage 4, to think your medical breakthrough is all she may need. So if anyone reading this is new and is considering Fairy's treatment....please educate yourself and make an informed decison. Now I will go away too...Mazy ",

Sandy, I appreciate the offer LOL but it wouldnt make stupid people change their minds anyways. I kinda left out the part that really bothered me the most. The lady that told me that stuff was diagnosed before I had stage 4. We worked together at the hospital and while she was taking chemo I did all her running for her (She had a desk job but once in awhile had to go to the floors). She couldnt handle walking long distances and since I had completed chemo I understood. I dont regret helping her and talking to her etc because I have a clear conscience and know that I did the right things. She and the other 2 have to live with their actions. I only donate money to this site and to our local breast center and cancer center. I know where most of that money goes so I dont question it.As for the big guys, far too much of the donated money goes to pay those fat salaries. They have been given so much and I really appreciate all they have done but they are getting too greedy for themselves..not for us. I want to see a national foundation that will actively promote stage 4 as needing immediate dollars. One of our members died yesterday needlessly because she was refused treatment until it was too late. She was a beautiful woman with a new hubby and she had 3 kids. She was sweet and kind and all she wanted was to live and be with her family. I dont think thats too much to ask. Hugs and Luvs, Mazy",

The lump showed up suddenly..my onc says this is common. It did not show on the mammogram I had 5 months earlier probly due to mine being lobular. FYI my onc and surgeon told me that just because a tumor moves is not an indication to them that its not cancer. It only means that it probably has not attached anywhere else yet.

It was very hard..so hard they had a hard time getting a biopsy and it moved freely and it hurt real bad. I thought I must have hit it or something. All my doctors say whether or not it can move or if it hurts or not,  does not tell a doctor if it's cancer. I have lobular and the odd shape is normal for that. Mine did not show on the mammogram but did show on the ultrasound. Lobular often does not show on mams and even some ductal evades it also. I have 2 great aunts who had the same type as me and one aunt who had ductal. I hope all goes well with you. Hugs, Mazy",

I went to the hospital with a sudden fever of 102.5. I was taking Abraxane at the time. Long story short, I was admitted to ICU after my vital signs and blood counts plummeted. I had sepsis, pneumonia, immunity was .02 and was spose to be 2.0, BP was 40/30 etc. One of my oncs came in the room to ask me if I wanted CPR if my heart stopped etc. I said as long as it was a temporary measure til my body could sustain itself. The onc actually tried to convince me to be DNR ( do not resuscitate). I had forgot my papers at home. My hubby was with me and he also told her I was to be resuscitated. That onc had already decided that I was not going to live thru it. After that, one nurse after another would ask me the same questions and act like I was a freak for not agreeing to be DNR. Well 5 days later I was transferred to the cancer floor from ICU. I wasnt in good shape but  had survived. The nurses on the cancer floor did the same thing. I finally had to get a little nasty with a head nurse to get it to stop. I told her that it was clear what my wishes are and that to tell the nurses, and docs to lay off. After 6 days I went home. It really bugs me that they were so convinced I was going to die and didnt want to bring me back if my heart stopped from low BP etc. I also thought I was going to die for awhile and I was scared. But they made me feel like I didnt have a chance...when I did. I may not be in the best shape but I'm still alive and am happy that I am. HUgs , Mazy",

This summer we found that there was a small amount of activity back in same spot. I had kyphoplasty surgery ( bone cement injected into voids of vertbrae) and am feeling much better. I  take Oxycontin, Oxycodone, Flexeril and Lyrica for pain. If my pain gets ahead of me, it effects the whole spine, hips, legs and feet and can then start working upwards.  It is a super strong pain and the only relief for me is to stay ahead of the pain with meds. Your mom should not be suffering with pain. Once she gets the pain under control with meds her life will greatly improve. It took about 3 months before we found what worked best for me but once we did, my quality of life greatly improved. I would call the onc ASAP and stress that she is suffering and needs something for her pain. God Bless...Mazy",

I also had the most severe pain I had ever known and often said it was worse than child birth. The onc tried morpine first but it came back up. Then we tried Fentynal patch of which I had a severe reaction. Finally we settled on Oxycontin 30 mg every 8 hrs and oxcycodone for break thru. I had 9 rads that helped but not much. I dont take alot of Oxycodone for break thru since my tumor has shrunk and no longer visible. I take Oxycontin tho every 8 hrs or the pain starts to take over. The key to controIling pain is to stay ahead of it as best you can. I have found that Ibuprofen helps me more for break thru and doesnt constipate me so bad. Pain meds cause severe constipation and the more you take the worse it gets so make sure you use some stool softeners. We recently tried morphine again but it didnt work..had a reaction. My onc says she has alot of success with Oxycontin for her patients. Please feel free to PM me anytime. Hugs, Mazy",

If it is of no fault of your own that you are losing this job then you qualify for unemployment as long you worked long enough etc. . You simply apply for unemployment and when they reject your claim they will have a hearing etc. I'm not sure about the laws etc in your area but here...you cant really fight for unemployment benefits unless you have applied and been refused. I was taking Zometa and Aromasin as my treatment when I was approved for SSDI. Being stage 4 is high priority with SSDI. I hear so many different stories from people about how they qualified. The rep at our SSD office told me straight up that if my onc wrote down that I could work as little as 2 hrs a week..I would be refused benefits. Others say they were actually still working and were approved. So I really dont understand why they dont treat each person the same on that. It didnt matter in my case because I definitley could not work even a little bit. I had stopped working the day I was dx. After 2 months we realized I would not be able to work at all and I applied online and then they set up a phone interview. I didnt even have to go to the office. The rep told me that my scans, labs etc were sufficient as proof and I didnt have to see one of their docs for further proof. I had to be off work 5 months and then started receiving my checks on the 6th month. I drew short term dis from my job until my SSDI checks started. Good luck to you and Im so sorry you even have to deal with any of this. HUgs, Mazy",

I was on FMLA , still employed but on short term disabilty STD provided by employer. I was still paying for my health ins and life ins out of my STD check. I applied for SSDI and they told me that STD had no bearing on my receiving SSDI but that my employers STD would no longer be paid once I was drawing SSDI. So you would not get them both..only one. I paid COBRA for my health ins for over 2 yrs and was offered to take over the life ins but declined since it was a smaller amount anyways. Find your life ins policy..it will have in there if you can pick it up after you are no longer employed. Life ins policies are so varied theres no way to know unless you look or have HR show you. If you are questioning the HR persons knowledge..maybe ask to speak to someone else and explain that you dont think she understands and you want to make sure you are doing things right. Also try going to social security site ( google) I dont have the exact addy but go look there and it should have some answers for you and explianed better than I have . You do have to have a last day worked date as far as I know. I doubt you would get much attention from SSDI if you were still working. Good luck, Mazy",

My lump was very hard and painful and moved freely but it was very much breast cancer. 80% of lumps found are not cancer so I hope you fit in that catagory. I dont know what state you are in but have you checked with your local breast center to see if there's a program available to help pay for your diagnostics etc? I live in Illinois and its here.

Diana, its always up to you if you accept chemo or not but honeslty at stage 3 I wouldnt even consider not getting it. I agree with Momine..if may not cure it but it may very well hold it at bay. I've known many ladies who have watched and/or felt their tumors shrinking while on chemo. Its amazing how fast they shrink sometimes. I hope the very best for you. Hugs and luv, Mazy",

The fact is you have symptoms of mets and are triple negative. So Im a little ticked that they waited to have scans done. Im not saying that you didnt need vit D but you should've been scanned in my opinion. I recently had issues with my onc who did have scans done but failed to read them. I only lost 10 days because I was in so much pain I didnt believe him when he said there was no cancer related reason for my pain. Mine ended up being mets. I did switch oncs. I had pain in my lower back, hips, pelvis, sacrum amd right thigh and thats where my bone marrow mets ended up being. I also am Type A and want it all laid out on a plate. I dont want any dancing around at all..just say it. I hope you dont have mets. One kind of good thing is that bone mets are more easily treated , but there can be alot of pain assoiciated with them. Please keep us updated. Hugs, Maz",

I saw where you mentioned that a stage 4 lady might chime in,  so here I am. I am guilty of many of the things that have been mentioned on this rant. In general I am not a politically correct type of person. I type what I feel. As for the \"death watch\" ..I dont think of it as such. It is much like sitting with a friend who is dying except I cant sit with all the ladies from BCO so I join in on the \"being there\" as best I can. Many family members print those prayers and soothing words and save them for other family members to read so yes they serve a purpose. For those of us who participate in the \"being there\" it is comforting to us to share our feelings because we are hurting too. I dont condemn anyone for not participating just because I do. It is a personal choice. Yes I pray for a miracle first and then for peace and comfort. Miracles do happen, why not here? Kbug and Watson were my friends. They both have participated in our vigils for others so I am pretty sure they were not offended when we did it for them.  Kbug said she could feel the prayers and love from our posts. Their families had nothing but gratitude to all of us for the prayers and kindness. We loved them like family and they knew it. I dont know where the term \"Death watch\" originated on this forum but that is certainly a poor description of what it actually is.  I call it \"Being there\".  I hope that maybe this clears up some of the ill feelings some have when one of us is dying. What seems \"ick\" to some is \"loving\" to others. We are all different but it makes none of us bad or mean spirited. Its just how it is when you have thousands of women in one breast cancer site. It would be pretty boring if we all thought the same. I agree that you shouldnt give advice unless you are sure of what you are saying. I know I have been guilty of that but hope I learned from it. Okay that was my 2 cents. I wish you all well. Hugs, Mazy",

I never mean to scare people but it is what it is and you need attention. When I was first dx with bone mets in 2006 my only symptom was severe feet pain for 2 weeks. I woke up one day with severe lower back pain and by late that night I lost use of my legs (legs gave out when I went to stand). My hubby took me to ER and the met showed on a regular xray. I was dx with bone mets in my 5th lumbar vertabrae. I had great results with Aromasin and Zometa and my cancer was inactive until recently. I had been having increase pain since december but the onc I had at the time brushed it off. I asked for some scans a few months ago and the onc said i was all clear. I was NOT clear. Knowing my pain was caused by something I found my old onc who actually read the scan results which said I had extensive bone marrow mets in my hips, pelvis, lumbar spine, sacrum and right thigh. Aromasin gave me 5 yrs but was no longer working. I am now on Faslodex and hoping it works as well or better than Aromasin did. I no longer take Zometa as I have osteo necrosis of the jaw. Call your oncologist and if you arent satisfied with what he does....find a new onc. HUgs, Mazy",

My first onc told me there is a high concentration of many cancers along both sides of the river. Is it that?? we really dont know but I do think its a good guess. Theres not just one thing that stands out to make the river guilty but maybe a combination of things. I think there are different causes for most of us. Different causes maybe depending on what type of breast cancer we have. Over the years they have announced many things that caused cancer only to back track later on and find they were wrong.

But I have days when I all I want to do is scream as loud as I can and say whatever I want to my cancer. Everytime I speak with someone about working etc..it saddens me because I can not work anymore. I enjoyed working with others as a team and accomplishing things. I was one of those people who rarely had more than 5 hrs sleep and could go non stop til moments b4 I hit the bed. After the stage 4 dx I was going nuts sitting in the recliner and everyone looking at me with \" the look\". I taught myself to crochet and it helped alot. Time seemed to help me. I didnt like my new normal but I could tolerate it and still be happy. I just keep myself as busy as I can while staying within my physical limits. Let ur hubby treat u like your special...he needs to do it for himself as well as for you. My hubby did the same things and still does sometimes. I told him he doesnt have to but he looked at me and said..\"yes I do because if something happens to you, I need to know that I treated you right and did everything I could\".

If you go to Catholics thread on Prayers and inspiration you will find that you are being prayed for on numerous Novenas. I am sure there are others also. When I first went on pain meds it took 3 months before we got it perfected and I wasn't sleeping all the time. Each time we raise the dose or change it it any way..I go thru a tired spell but it passes eventually. I hope and pray for you to have strength to do this.

I can not sleep in a regular bed unless I prop myself with pillows to make it as much like a recliner as I can. I slept in the recliner for 5 yrs and recently had to change since I have more mets. I now sleep in a very supportive metal frame lawn chair and that has helped tremendously. I have always used a neck pillow. I use heat for my lumbar spine and cold for my poor achey butt. My increased pain ended up being extensive mets in my bone marrow.I hope you get good results on your scans..Hugs, Mazy",

They will most likely cut the Zometa to every 3 or 4 months this year sometime. For now we arent changing the Aromasin and plan on using it til stops working and then would switch to a different AI.

It isnt life as it was before but I'm happy to be alive and living half way descent with the help of drugs. When I first was diagnosed with stage 4, I wasnt allowed to do much of anything but sit. So I bought a book to teach myself crochet( something I had always wanted to learn) and had Dish network installed. I couldnt do much but I could watch TV and sit and crochet. I could read books. I ordered many things I needed thru the internet since shopping was in a wheelchair and only once a week when my hubby took me. I could talk on the phone too (of course) LOL.

I took 14 treatments of radiation and take Aromasin and also Zometa infusions once monthly. The Zometa healed my bone totally. I have feeling back in my leg and feet. My tumor is stable. I have no probs with Zometa. I am on SSDI now and am considered permanently disabled but I really do pretty good as long as I'm careful. Getting my pain under control was the biggest challenge we had. After trying different combos of drugs we finally found that Oxycontin 20mg every 12 hours and Oxycodone/Tyl 5/325 for break away pain was best for me. I get very sick on morphine and some of the others and couldnt tolerate them. I sleep with a heating pad and take hot soaks in the tub to loosen me up in the mornings. My worst time of day is when I'm first trying to get up..I'm soooo stiff.  Hope it all works out for you. Mazy",

He said when things start moving then we will start removing the other stuff til we have a happy medium. I have come very close to going to ER over my bowels. I have found that using glycerine suppositories with lots of vaseline on it do help things to be less painful when they come out. Miralax, Metamucil, Benfiber, Phillips mag etc do not help me at all.

I would keep looking for a doctor who will listen to you. Having had LCIS should be reason enough. My question is this...if your oncs and gyno can feel them then why cant they ask for another biopsy? My biopsy was not done by a breast surgeon, it was done by a chief radiologist. There are other surgeons who can also do them. I know it may seem better to have a breast surgeon  but I am saying that it doesnt have to be. Do you know how many samples they took during your biospy? On one of mine...it came back inconclusive and that was the reason they repeated it. By the way, I was skinny as a bean pole when I was diagnosed..so thin that it was mentioned in my reports, and that was never even mentioned as a reason to ignore anything. I am no doctor but I strongly advise you to get a second or third opinion. The top quadrant, nearest your armpit is, according to my oncs and surgeon, an area of concern. Lobular breast cancer is sneaky and it like s to hide. Until if or when you get something more conclusive, keep a very close eye on things. I have lobular and the lump in my breast was rock hard, painful and it moved easily. It just kinda popped up and made itself known when I saw it in the mirror one night. I was seen by a surgeon within 2 days and was in the operating room within the week and my surgeon said that it had grown during that time. I know that is unusual but my surgeon said that some lobular tumors are known for that. I am not trying to scare you...but I agree with you that you have a valid concern and I would be asking my oncs or gyno to arrange for another biopsy soon. Keep in touch, Hugs, Mazy",

MO means theres no distant metastasis which is good. The lower the number on T and N the better. Yours are T1 and N1 so thats good. Your tumors were small also. I know theres nothing good about cancer but in our world there are some things better than others. What stage are you? Also what type do you have? Most have ductal or lobular. I have lobular. Someone who has extranodal spread will most likley come along soon. I just wanted to let you know theres hope for us all. I've had breast cancer for 10 yrs, 6 of those with mets. Hope this helps calm you a little. Have you tried out the chat room? It was a Godsend to me. Hugs, Mazy",

Naproxen doesnt make me tired at all. The Oxycodone for break thru pain knocks me out. Oxycontin (time release) and Flexeril made me pretty tired for a month or so but after that I gradually got used to it, its not bad at all. I do not take flexeril and oxycontin at the same time or it will make me tired. Hope u get relief soon. Hugs, Mazy",

The family discussed it at length with all her doctors and as much as they could with her.
