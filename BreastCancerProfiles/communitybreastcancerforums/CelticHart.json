My surgeon requires less than 15 ccs in a 24 hour period before removing a drain. The surgeon's office showed my husband how to cut the stitch and remove the drain, so yesterday when the right side was below 15 ccsÂ for two days in a row, he removed my right drain. It didn't hurt at all. They always thought my left side would take longer to heal and stop draining because it was radiated when I had my lumpectomy 2 years ago. Any hints on how to reduce drainage? Does sitting still really help?",
