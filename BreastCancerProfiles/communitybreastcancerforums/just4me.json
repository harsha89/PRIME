So nowÂ I know it is cancer but the fears of the type, stage, etc.. are just terrifying. The lump is in my left breast and goes to under my arm. I am also having an MRI this thursday as my right breast is also tender and to check my lymph nodes. Just want to say I'm glad I found this site. Feel like I need to be strong for my husband as I see the fear in his eyes and my daughter eyes too. Just feeling like I want to cry but by giving in to the tears I'm afraid I'll be admitting defeat. The stories of past courage... can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But they cannot supply courage itself. For this each man must look into his own soul. Log in to post a reply",

Then my daughter took the day off from work and came over and she cried with me also. Seems all these tears have released a lot of fears, concerns and most of all the love of our family. Thank you again ladies!",
