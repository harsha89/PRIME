I just want to tell you that I love what you said -- \"That's my vision of immortality -- starting again as carbon and nitrogen.\" This is how I feel, too. That's religion, eternal life, reincarnation, spirituality, whatever you want to call it to me. It's a bit sad, but I had a sweet, white, one-eyed kitty named Karma who was run over in the alley behind my house about 6 years ago. Where her blood was shed, a weed grew in the middle of the dirt road, and I would touch it and talk to it because I knew in some way it was made of a part of her. I can find meaning in the most trivial things, but I also recognize that we seek to find meaning even when there may be none and that the simplest explanation may well be the right one. My interpretation: You miss your babies, you need to plan your next tropical getaway, and you need to get laid! Maybe the white light was just the big \"O.\" ;)  (Yeah, I don't know why you took your kitties there.... silly!)",

It's a beautiful hotel and is connected to MD Anderson. There are many dining options there, some entertainment options, free DVD and movie rentals, a workout room, pool, lab services at th hotel for blood specimen collection. . . all kinds of great reasons to stay there. They also have a shuttle that will take you anywhere you want to go within 3 miles of the hotel. If you fly, there really is no need to rent a car.You can find hotels nearby for 10-20 dollars less per night, but we had a bad experience with one and feel the extra money is worth it. Our first trip there, we stayed at least two weeks, but our visit also fell over a holiday weekend. They will want to run all their own scans, adn I believe the reason the first visit takes so long is that you will see the Dr first, then he/she will order your scans which will be fit in wherever they can squeeze you in the schedule. After the first trip, things will be more streamlined. Now we do scans one day and see the onc the next day for results. Especially if you stay at the Rotary House, book more nights than you think you will need. You can check out early with no penalty at all.  I know getting that first trip coordinated seems like a crazy hassle, but things settle down after that. Hope you can get everything worked out. ",

She's had scans about every 2-3 months which have shown her liver mets shrinking, so her onc at MD Anderson (where she gets her scans in Houston, TX) advised her to keep going since her side effects are not too bad -- a little neuropathy, dry eyes. The MDA onc wants to get \"maximum response\" from the T/H. On the other hand, her local onc (Odessa, TX) would have had her take a break (a few weeks or a month, he said) a long time ago. Probably after 15-20 treatments.  I think opinions vary as to how to go about treatment for stage IV. Some focus on quality of life. Some focus on maximum response. No way is unequivocally right. My mom and I agree that she should go with the MDA opinion and keep going since she is responding well. That just makes sense to me. :) The only thing I can really add is that the other reason you might stop a particular chemo is if the side effects get to be something your mom feels she can't tolerate. Glad to hear your mom is stable! Hope she can continue this treatment for a long time if it agrees with her!",

Dreamwriter-- I think her reaction is \"mild\" (but annoying!) enough that her onc still wants to use contrast, but she has mentioned that if it gets worse, we could do it without. ",

I don't think it was marketed well, but it is about early movies and a film maker. The boy's father dies in a fire, but it is not too sad. Touching, but not devastating.

It starts about 6 hours after the contrast is given, begins with a prickly feeling on her face, and then causes her face to turn red and swell. The redness even goes onto her chest and arms. She also says her whole body feels kinda achy or sore a few days after. After that reaction, they have been gving her a steroid pack which helps, but does not copletely stop the symptoms. Just thought I'd throw it out there and see if anyone else has this type of reaction, and if there is anything else you've tried that helps? She also gets a bone scan, but from what I've been told, the reaction is most likely to the CT contrast and not the bone scan dye.  We're heading to MDA for scans at the end of October, but she's flying to Michigan to stay with me for a week starting Monday.

The largest was just under 5 cm and there were over 20 other smaller ones. She was diagnosed in Sept. 09, started Taxol/Herceptin in Oct. She just had a scan last week and the tumors in her liver are still shrinking. She has been totally asymptomatic and the only effects from the chemo, besides hair loss and minor fatigue, have been a tiny bit of tingling in her fingers and toes and darkening (not too noticable) of fingernails and a little weeping from one toenail. Stage IV is never good news, but there is lots of hope! There are many treatments out there and new ones coming along all the time! Please do, though, carefully consider the liver biopsy. If your status has changed with the mets to include er+, you will have many more treatment options at your disposal. I'm not sure what the chances are that your status can change, but I know it's possible. My mom's went from 5% er+ to 0%.  We have not been gven a prognosis, and I'm glad. We haven't asked for one either. Just keep reading these forums. The women here are so encouraging, and there are many living a long time with liver mets and more.",

      "Content": "Jan 14, 2010 03:01PM KarmaKittie wrote: I've been reading here for months and need to send an intro soon. This forum has been an amazing source of information for me, and I treasure you all so much! My mother is the patient, but we have been to MD Anderson 3 times now. I think the best thing about going there is that you can do all your scans one day and see the Dr for results the very next day. We've also been told there is a team of doctors who review your case to make recommendations for treatment. Rotary House is wonderful, though, yes, a little expensive. You can get a room there for about $100-$120 a night. They have a hat cart one night a week where you can pick up a complimentary hat, they show movies in the TV room a couple nights a week, have live music about once a week or so, and offer free movie rentals and DVD players you can check out. Another thing I love is that they have complimentary fruit (apples, oranges, and bananas) available in the workout room. There is also a nice park between the Rotary House and the Mays Clinic (where the breast cancer oncs are and most testing is conducted). We like to go sit there and feed the squirrels and birds. There is a nice (and kinda pricy) restaraunt on the 2nd floor Rotary House. The buffet is almost $20, bu you can get the \"soup and salad\" buffet which includes the hot side dishes and dessert for only $14. The only thing left out is the meat dishes. There is also a good stir fry place that is pretty inexpensive for lunch -- they also sell jello, pudding, friut, cereal, snack bars and other things. Another little place has sandwiches and a salad bar, and there is also an ice cream stand and a coffee shop that has a limited Starbucks selection. Wheel chairs are available for transport to the Mays Clinic, and you never even need to step outside if you don't want to. There is a sky brige connecting the buildings, though it is a fairy long walk. They have souped up golf carts for transport through the sky bridge, too.  I know this is not exactly the info you asked for, but I've been wanting to get this out there in case anyone is looking for MD Anderson info.  As far as getting in, we had our hometown onc call and also called ourselves. You will be given a personal appointment coordinator (or someething to the effect) who will be in touch with you about dates and who will let you know all the files and scans you need to bring with you. You may need to fill out a form locally to get your scan reads faxed to them, but you may want to also hand carry everything you can, including hard copies (disks) of your scans, although you should be prepared for them to redo every one of your scans. They did that for my mother. Their CT, specifically, takes smaller \"slices,\" so some of their equipment may give a better picture of what is going on.  We were told to be prepared to be there for at least 5-7 business days. RESERVE AT LEAST 3 WEEKS AT THE ROTARY HOUSE. If you leave early there is ABSOLUTELY no penalty or extra fee, but they do book up sometimes, and it may not be possible to stay longer than your original reservation. When you call them, they will ask your patient number. Just tell them this is your first visit and that you dont have one yet. That will be fine. They will have a packet of info waiting for you which will include your schedule and infrmation about the facilities and services they provide, and they will have you talk to a patient coordinatior when you arrive.   Oh, and you can also do bloodwork at the Rotary house the night before you are scheduled for a blood draw at the May's clinic. Very convenient as the wait can be pretty long at the Mays Clinic. I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, I'm glad to try to find answers for you!",
