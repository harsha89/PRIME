I was sent to the breast care center for an ultrasound they called me back for a biobsy, I was told on Dec 20 that it was cancer that was the first time I cried. I go Jan. 14th for an MRI they are looking for bilaterial cancer (my mom had bc twice) I get upset but not as offen as I figured I would, I look in the merror I don't look sick and I don't feel sick, I think reality will hit my when they give me a sergary date, I dont know. I have times when it bothers me exspecialy when people who don't have it or don't know anyone that dose have bc try to give me medical advise. for now I keep as busy as I can so that I won't have time to think about it.",
