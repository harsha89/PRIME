The only thing it showed was thickening, some calcifications, scar tissue, and fat necrosis around her areola. Any results they found they said was probably benign and/ or a result from BCS and treatment in the past. They do want her to follow up in 6 months regardless. She also talked to the surgeon today and discussed everything with her, said the antibiotics were clearing everything up nicely and she\u2019s almost positive Its not IBC, but if it comes back within the next month then they would do a punch biopsy. infectious disease also told her it didn\u2019t look like IBC and definitely just recurring cellulitis and she may just have to be on Keflex around the clock or whenever there are signs of a flare up.  I\u2019m reassured... she still isn\u2019t though at least not 100%. But from me, being a nurse, it definitely looks better and know IBC would never do that",

My mom went to the ED with symptoms of cellulitis in her breast. She\u2019s a cancer survivor (it\u2019s been like 10 years) and this is her second bout of cellulitis since January. The first time they prescribed Keflex and it went away. This time, they gave her a shot of Rocephin and sent her home on oral Keflex. Immediately she started feeling better and the redness slowly started going away. She followed up with her oncologist who said she\u2019s seen IBC before but she didn\u2019t think that\u2019s what my mom wasn\u2019t presenting as. How relieving... however she said she was going to schedule a MRI and an appt with the surgeon that didn\u2019t her BSC 10 years ago. Ok fine. I\u2019m relieved and so is she... Well fast forward to yesterday (5/6). She said she woke up feeling cruddy again and the redness, tenderness, peeling (but I think the peeling was it healing), and I felt it and it feels somewhat hard. I\u2019m freaking out. Her appt with her surgeon is today and her MRI on Monday. Is it possible she just needs stronger antibiotics and the Keflex didn\u2019t completely treat the cellulitis this time? Her breast had started clearing up and was responding to the antibiotics which isn\u2019t not typical of IBC, correct? I\u2019m sure the surgeon will go ahead and order the punch biopsy though. What a great way to start off the week leading up to Mother\u2019s Day Log in to post a reply",
