They're starting to get the whole picture in.  It's ER+, PR-, HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma.  Grandma had DCIS back in 1985, treated successfully with lumpectomy and radiation.  She is more than likely positive for the BRCA2 mutation as well, because my mom found out she was a carrier this year after getting diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The doctor is telling Grandma that her tumor is too big to remove right away with surgery--which will be a mastectomy, since re-radiation with lumpectomy isn't an option in that same breast.  She says that if she does a mastectomy now, she will have to take all the skin on the breast as well.  This confuses me.  Can breast cancer that isn't \"inflammatory breast cancer\" still involve the skin?  I haven't seen the breast but my mom says it's shiny and a little puckered in a few spots, but not like the skin of an orange.  But I'm guessing invasive ductal carcinoma can invade the skin just as it could the chest wall?  Otherwise, why wouldn't this doctor just do a skin-sparing mastectomy? The reason I'm asking is because all the websites seem to say that you're supposed to take hormone therapy after surgery.  But Grandma will be taking hormone therapy first, to shrink the tumor, and then will have her breast(s) removed.  It seems backwards.  I haven't read this being the norm anywhere and Grandma is averse to getting a second opinion.  We still don't know about spread or staging.  The doctor guesses at IIB or III-something.  She'll get the scans and bloodwork for that done here in the next few days.  The doctor also has a strong feeling that the cancer hasn't spread beyond the chest wall, though I don't know how she knows that without scans.  Thanks for any advice you may have.  I'm here for my grandma.

The woman rarely even sits down.  She really is something else.  Besides the DCIS back in '85 and a bout of panic attacks and back pain here recently, she's been perfectly healthy.  I would think this would play into the doctors' decision, but it's probably true that an older body (even a healthy one like hers) might not be able to handle chemo as well.  Still, she's much younger in spirit than in years.",

      "Content": "KTmarie wrote: Just starting this journey with my grandma.  Been on a different one with my mom since September when she was diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer. Grandma has so far just seen a breast surgeon who diagnosed her.  Here is the information I have about her dx so far: Invasive ductal carcinoma, ER+ PR+ HER2-, tumor is 12cm, don't know the histological grade. Her ki67 was rated \"high\" as in over 20% of the cells, but I can't find an exact figure.  She is probably BRCA2 positive because my mom is a carrier. Grandma had DCIS back in 1985. They got it with lumpectomy and radiation. This new cancer is in the same breast. The skin on her breast is really taut and the tumor is extremely hard.  She's felt it for going on two years now.  The surgeon is sending her to a medical oncologist but she says the treatment will be hormone therapy to shrink the tumor, then mastectomy.  The surgeon says she would have to cut away all of Grandma's breast skin if she did the surgery now.  Does this mean the skin has been invaded, too? I am kinda freaking out about the ki67 number. Even on the path report it says \"associated with poor outcomes\".  Just a little bit of research and I'm seeing that ER+ cancers are supposedly rarely high in ki67.  Also that cancers with a high ki67 number are usually treated aggressively with chemotherapy.  But Grandma's surgeon is saying that she probably won't have to do chemo.  It just isn't making sense. I'm sure you have all spilled your treatment stories already but if what Grandma's surgeon is suggesting sounds right please feel free to share your treatment with me.  Or even if it sounds wrong.  I am just having trouble making sense of what I'm reading with what was said at the doctor's office today.  With my mom's ovarian cancer, there is pretty much one standard of care and they don't know so many different factors to influence the treatment protocol.  Breast cancer diagnosis and treatment is incredibly complex. I just want to have faith in Grandma's doctor like I do my mom's. I'm here for my grandma. Dx 5/10/2010, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIB, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
