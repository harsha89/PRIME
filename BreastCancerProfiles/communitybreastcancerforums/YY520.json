I have lost almost all my hair at my 2nd and 3rd infusion.Lashes are all gone but some eyebrow left when I had the treatment all done(5 months later).Now my hair is growing back, an inch long, 5 months now since I stopped chemo. All eye lashes and eyebrow are back. I noticed regrow of hair 2 weeks after the chemo stopped. The hair is finer and curly. I wear a wig while waiting for my hair to grow longer. That makes me feel better.",
