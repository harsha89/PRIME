She had her tumour removed yesterday, with clear margins, tests clear for lungs and liver, waiting on lymph node comfirmation (90%sure good), and bone scan results. My sister also was diagnosed 2 years ago with basal cell skin cancer and had a tumour removed from her nose. I am seeing a dermatologist and have an appoint. with my doctor tomorrow to discuss screening for breast cancer. I was wondering if anyone knows of an identical twin that has breast cancer and the risks with an identical twin being diagnosed with breast cancer? Log in to post a reply",
