It cracks me up that when I had my twins at 31 they called me a mother of advanced age and now that I have breast cancer I am considered a young woman, it's strange. Kittycat- So sorry to hear about the delay of your treatment and the lack of answers from the professionals. Hopefully they can get everything resolved soon. I had my first treatment this morning. So far so good. No problem with the Taxotere at all. I am also getting Gemzar twice a cycle for my first 4 cycles in the clinical study. It was painful going in so the onco. nurse diluted it with saline right away and wrapped my arm in a warm towel. So my total discomfort was probably less than 2 minutes. Thank goodness for thoughtful and attentive nurses. I am starting to get some hot sensations in my mouth and throat though they are not in any way impacting my eating or drinnking. It just feels odd. Last night was a challenge because thanks to the decadron I had trouble sleeping so when they put benedryl through in my pre-meds this morning I started to doze. It was nice and relaxing. Hopefully things will remain smooth. Luck to all.",

Wow- when I write it out it does seem like quite a commitment. If I am included in the control group in the trial everything stays the same without any Avastin. Luckily the trial is randomized but not blind, so I will know from the beginning exactly which meds I'm getting. I am really hopeful about the Avastin. Currently the lump in my breast is pretty large so I would like everything to shrink really, really small so that I can have a less invasive surgery.",

Latte- I am having neoadjuvant chemo and have a marker in my tumor and in a lymph node. It was easy and they placed them both during core biopsies. A little stinging lidocaine and then some pressure when they put it in. The only difficult parts of both placements were keeping my arm above my head until it fell asleep and having a ton of mammogram film taken after to check the placement. Overall, it wasn't bad at all.",

I've been a little fatigued and had a little nausea, but luckily never at the same time. The compazine worked like a charm and I've only had to take it twice. My nurses warned me that I should take it at the first sign of anything bad, but that if I take it too often I will probably have terrible constipation, so I've tried to use it sparingly. The down side is that I feel normal only in time to go back in tomorrow for another Gemzar infusion. The arm of the clinical trial I'm in adds 8 Gemzar infusions into my 4 Taxotere cycles. I'm happy to get the added benefit of the meds for free, but not so excited to sit in the infusion suite again just one week after my first treatment. Mimi- I have also broken out like crazy. I thought maybe it was just me. I hope it stops soon. Look Good Feel Better has a great website that allows you to look for program dates near you. I am registered for one on the 28th and when I called the American Cancer Society offered lots of other supports and programs too. They are sending me a info. packet. I'll let ya'll know if it's any good.  I am actually looking forward to my hair falling out. I usually get it dyed and cut on a pretty tight schedule which I didn't stick to knowing that it would come out soon. Suffice to say it looks terrible, lots of dark roots and shaggy. A scarf will be a welcome sight after the way it looks now. I have to go out of town for work for a couple of days this week and then when I return my husband and kids are going to shave my head. They have lots of ideas of strange hair cuts they want to give me before they shave it. I believe mullet and mohawk are both on the list. My twins are 6 and are super pumped to have a bald mom because they don't know anyone else with one. My husband and I have tried to give them as much factual information along the way without any of the scary parts. One of the funniest moments was when one of my daughter's friends asked me if he could smell my breath because he thought my daughter said I had \"breath cancer\". They certainly keep the mood light at our house, thank goodness. Kittycat- I know you've talked about looking for an Avastin study. This is a link to the one I am in clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NC... .  Also the American Cancer Society has a clinical trial finder option when you contact them that might be helpful.",
