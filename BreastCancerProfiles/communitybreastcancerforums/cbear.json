I have been told its possibly stage 1 and no lympnodes looked abnormal but the surgeon wants to do a lumpectomy and a sentinal node. I am having alot of trouble with this decision of lumpectomy or taking both off. I am very small to the plastic surgeon and says that the radiation will leave me very unhappy in about a year. He wants to take the off with expanders. He also said breast cancer wont come back if i do that. That is not what i have read. Please someone help me with this big decision. What are my chances at 47 of it coming back? HELP",

I had to ask for the appointment with surgeon and that didnt go well at all. I asked them for a copy of my report and they said we will mail it to you. Its been a month and no report.

That medicine that gave me kept me alseep for 45 mnutes after surgery and they had to get me up. Then went home and slept from 1p.m. till 6p.m. I loved it since i had not slept in 2 days because of the fear of surgery. My Dr. was so nice that morning but went to see him Friday a week later and same old Dr. No bedside manner at all. Guess its the white coat in his office. He stated that with no radiation i had 50 percent it would come back. Then 10 percent benifit for radiation and 10 percent chemo. Is that all i get is 80 perecnt? Have not got the patholgy report in my hands because they have to mail it but he drew 2 little dots on a piece of paper for 2 nodes. He said he took out 2 only and radiation will sterilize the others. WHAT! He said because of nodes i am stage 2 but i have read you can still be stage 1 with nodes. Can anyone help me with that and the percentages of no reoccurance for radiation and chemo. And under the arm seems a bit more sore then any other day. Could this be because of the nodes gone?",
