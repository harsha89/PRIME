Lump/Rad/Reconstruction/Infection following reconstruction.Â One breast is beautiful, the other a mess. 6 years clear. Now on Arimidex and feel like I swallowed a puffy pillow. I dislike the color pink and the word, \"Survivor.\" I want to forget what I went through and move on. I was fairly good at it until my sis died last year at 58. (She had Stage 2,13 nodes, chemo, rad, recurrence in liver and bones.) I don't want cancer to define me. But, it's hard to forget about it with all these damn doctor's appointments! Thanks for your \"real\" post.",
