I was diagnosed 5/05/14 with stage III triple negative metastatic breast cancer. I was 30 at the time. I've since tested positive to BRCA 1 gene. I have undergone chemo, bilatetal mastectomy and reconstruction, radiation and hysterectomy. I was exceptionally blessed to have a complete pathological response to chemo. Though usually really positive lately I'm feeling overcome with the fear of recurrence/spread. Every pain and ache and I'm petrified. Does anyone have any tips dealing with these feelings?",

I was diagnosed May last year at 30 with metastatic triple negative bc. Tested BRCA1 positive. I went straight into chemo, surgery and then radiation. And just had hysterectomy. I was lucky to have a complete pathological response to chemo, but like many I have been struggling with the fear that it has spread. Every pain and my mind thinks the worst. For a couple of weeks now I have been experiencing pain on my rib. I mentioned it today and doc 1 went and got doc 2 and they bother felt it,and booked me for bone scan first thing Mon. They said it could just be scar tissue but I'm freaking out.",
