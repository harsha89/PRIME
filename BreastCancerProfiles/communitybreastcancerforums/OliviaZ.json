I brought it up with the lactation nurse and my doctor, both told me not to worry and that it is probably just a clogged duct. They were going to wait until after I was done breastfeeding to see if it goes away. I brought it up with my doctor again recently because when my baby latches on she somehow latches onto the lump sometimes too, and that hurts. My doctor decided it was time for an ultrasound. I went for my ultrasound 2 days ago and was diagnosed with a complex cyst and currently waiting for a biopsy. I have really bad post partum anxiety and the cyst is all I think about now. I'm not sleeping and all I do is Google it over and over again. I'm scaredðŸ˜¢ Log in to post a reply",

I've had a lot happen in my family including a parent being diagnosed with ALS and I don't want to tell them about this...they don't need the stress. So thankfully I found these forums and it helps me a lot to talk to people! I just confirmed my biopsy for Monday. I'm very nervous.",
