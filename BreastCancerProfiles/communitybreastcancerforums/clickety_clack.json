I saw it once; it looked like a puckered belly-button. It had a mole-like-looking bit on the inside. She went for FNA (fine needle aspiration) tests. The doctor said cancer cells were present, and that chemo may be needed. She went for a mammogram, but will only get the results later in +-6 weeks (the follow-up appointment is at the end of Jan 2014) (It's a government hospital) She's been instructed to stop taking her hormone replacement therapy in the meantime (which she has been taking for several years) Has anyone experienced something similar? How did it turn out? I guess we shouldn't stress until further results come, but 6 weeks feels so long. In this early stage we don't want to tell family/friends, so I don't have anyone to talk to about it.
