In regards to there being a waiting period to start treatment-I think there is. I got the results of my breast biopsy on 11/29/2010 and saw the breast surgeon on 11/30 but then it was two more weeks before I saw her again (all in the meantime having CT scans and a bone scan and an  MRI to check for distant spread) which there was none. Then it wasn't until 12/29/2010 that I met with my oncologist. But once you meet with the oncologist things seem to move pretty fast.I think the doctors like to do a good work-up so they can decide on the best course of treatment. I had my first treatment of chemo yesterday(1/5/11) and so far am doing really well. No nausea or vomiting. The pre-meds they give you are fantastic-especially the Emend. Good luck and keep us posted. (hugs!)",

I take it at night. it definately helps me sleep better. She said it also helps with anticipatory nausea. When I was first diagnosed in November i was waking up every few hours too! This diagnosis is hard at first-but we are coping. Chemo went much better than I expected. But yes- Ativan helps greatly with the sleep.",

Will finally be starting treatment tomorrow with chemotherapy first and then a mastectomy following that. I will be having Adriamycin and Cytoxan every two weeks times 4 andthen Taxol every two weeks times four (dose dense). It seemed to take a long time to get all the results back from the CT scan, MRi and Bone Scan. I do not have metastases anywhere except for my lymph nodes. Will not know how many until surgery. Am looking forward to starting the fight of this disease tomorrow! Have been given several books to read about chemo and have been reading the threads here. It seems the thing to do is drink, drink, drink before, after and during chemo. Have already bought a wig and plan to have my head buzzed before hair really starts falling out in clumps. Am grateful for these discussion boards. There is so much information here. Will keep in touch about how it goes tomorrow. They tell me that Emend is a wonder drug and have zofran and compazine also to fight the nausea and vomiting. Will have a port placed on Monday so they are going to use my arm veins tomorrow. Good luck and hugs to all those starting Chemo this month!",

The infusion went smoothly-they used my arm veins as I will have a port placed on Monday. I drank a lot prior to going and during the infusion. Had to use the restroom directly after and wow-Pink Urine! but that is to be expected with the adriamycin. Don,t know for sure what meds you will be getting but hope all goes well for you. The pre-meds really helped. They gave me ativan, Emend, Zofran and compazine prior to the infusion. Was a little tired this afternoon,took a nap and then just went shopping. So so far so good. Will keep you posted! Good luck to everyone getting chemo during this time. Remeber to stay well hydrated.",

Had first treatment of dose dense Adriamycin and Cytoxan on Jan.5. Today is day eight and so far have had very little S/E's from chemo. Had some constipation day 3 (I know, TMI) but took colace and senekot and that helped. Was given several antiemetics-never got nauseated. The hardest thing right now is getting used to this port in my chest that was placed on Monday. Anyone else with a sore neck from port placement? Everyone tells me the port is worth it so am hoping I get used to it. My 2nd dose of chemo is scheduled for jan. 19. Here's hoping for another good treatment. I do have to say that I have been very thirsty since receiving the chemo and have been drinking a lot. Good luck to everyone starting chemo this month.",

Yes -it is common to have a dry mouth the day of treatment and the day after. The nurses tell me it is from all  the antinausea meds. And yes, I had pink urine the day of treatment also-lol. Hope your treatment course goes well for you. I am having my second A/C tomorrow and so far no bad side effects. Not even from the neulasta shot. Am just waiting for my hair to fall out now. Today is day 14 and still have all of it, but I am ready with my wig, scarves and hats. Can't bring myself to have my head buzzed yet. Again-good luck post treatment and thanks for posting. I really enjoy reading this thread. It helps so much in knowing what to expect with treatment.",
