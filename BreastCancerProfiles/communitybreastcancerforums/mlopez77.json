I continued working and running my kids around while waiting for my results. We had planned a vacation for the week of Easter. My BS told me not to cancel my vacation. She called me the Monday after Easter with my malignant results. Ughhh. I too work in the Healthcare field. I am a RN and work as a nurse informatist. I am in charge of an entire hospital and 9 clinics. It was very hard to keep my diagnosis private. I had to prepare everyone for my time off and introduce and train my temporary replacement. I worked up until the day of my surgery. Everyone has been so supportive. I just took this job last July. I am fairly new. The nurses at the hospital put together a Meal train for 4 weeks. They brought dinner to my house for a whole month after my bilateral mastectomy with tissue expander placement. They sent cards, brownies, gift baskets, gift cards, they still continue to stop by once a week to check on me. I don't know how I would have made it through this without them. You'd be surprised with how many people have fought this fight, and you didn't even know. Once I shared my story with them, at least 10 woman that I worked with daily shared their breast cancer journey with me. I too went to a very dark place after my diagnosis. I never questioned the bilateral mastectomy. My grandmother died at 53 and my mom at 52 from breast cancer. I had tried to have a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy 10 years ago, but it was denied by insurance. However, I wasn't prepared for the treatment after the bilateral mastectomy. I had only contemplated having the mastectomy prior to being diagnosed. I questioned taking treatment. Why? I have a genetic mutation BRCA2 and CHEK2. It's the same cancer my grandma and mom had. Look at their outcome. Why would it be any different for me? Why was I going to poison my body with chemo and be sick if I was just going to die at 50? Why not enjoy these years and not be sick from treatment? I had to do some deep soul searching and pull myself out of that. My life has a purpose and I strongly believe that my purpose on this earth has not been met. I am a strong woman. You are strong as well. Anyone facing this is strong. Don't you dare tell yourself any different. I am going to live to see my children graduate, go to college, start a career, get married, and meet my grandchildren. (Hopefully and preferably in that order.) I am not going to give up. I have so much to live for. So many things that I want to accomplish. I am not my mother or my grandmother. I refuse to let this disease take over my life. I am going to beat this. I can't do it on my own. I need the support of my family, my friends, my community, my breast cancer sisters. I share my story because I want to bring awareness to this disease. I want woman to do monthly breast exams. I am a nurse. It is my job to educate people on how to care for themselves and advocate for themselves. Please know that you are not alone in this fight. Treatment has come so far in the last 10 years. I started chemo on May 31st. It was nothing like when my mom went through chemo. I kept waiting for something to happen when I came home. No nausea, no vomiting, a few mouth sores, nothing medicine couldn't heal, a little fatigue. Not too bad. I have not worked since my bilateral mastectomy on April 25th. I had a rough recovery from that surgery. I needed 5 weeks to recover. I personally feel like I could go back to work during chemo, but my oncologist and my fiance want me to focus on me and taking care of me. They have me off until October. I know not everyone can take off 6 months from work. However, I must admit I am going a little stir crazy in this house. We may have to discuss my leave after I finish Adriamycin and Cytoxan next month. Please keep us updated on how you're doing. Sending hugs, love and light :) Mandy   ",

I feel sunburned on my chest too. I've been using miaderm but only twice a day. I may have to bump it up to 3 or 4 times a day. Tonight I decided to lather on shine Aquaphor to see if that helps. I'm starting to see the light at the end of this very long tunnel.",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2016 07:41AM - edited Jun 4, 2016 10:56PM by mlopez77 Good morning all! I am a 36 year old, single mom of 3, a registered nurse, and live in the Raleigh area. I have a boyfriend of 10 years. However, I had to relocate last year for my job, so unfortunately we are now doing the long distance thing until his contract is up in 2017. I was diagnosed in March with IDC in the left breast, stage IIIA, grade 2, 7/27 lymph nodes +, ER+, PR+, HER2/NEU -. Genetic testing showed BRCA2 mutation and CHEK2. Had bilateral mastectomy with tissue expander placement on April 25th. Started AC on May 31st. I was a nervous wreck. Glad that is over with. Not as bad as I thought. I have had a terrible headache on and off all week since my first treatment. Then two days ago the sores appeared on my tongue. I was brushing with a soft bristle toothbrush after every meal, gargling with salt water 4x daily, drinking 80 oz of water a day, rinsing with mouth wash for dry mouth, and still managed to get sores. I called my nurse and she called in some scripts. My mouth is feeling a little better. Any advice for the mouth sores? What type of foods are you all eating? I can't eat anything, or should I say I don't want to eat anything. I've lost 25 lbs since April 25th. I can still lose another 30 and be alright ;) Nothing is appealing to me, and if it is, I take 2 bites and I'm done. OAJ2013 I was wondering about sex too. We had sex after my mastectomy. That was fine. He's coming to visit the end of this month and I am really nervous about sex. It is such a huge part of our lives. It's not that I don't want to, I just don't want to do anything to hinder my treatment plan. My oncologist said it's fine to have sex during treatment just avoid the first 48 hours. He also said to use condoms and to take it slow. We'll see. Thanks ladies for sharing your story. I hope to keep in touch through this journey. ",

Did you get any sores in your mouth? I would be ok if I could get rid of these sores on my tongue. It's a constant burning. I've been eating soggy cereal, applesauce, and greek yogurt. I actually felt hungry today, but I'm so hesitant to eat with these sores.",

      "Content": "Jun 9, 2016 08:50AM - edited Jun 9, 2016 08:52AM by mlopez77 My cousin is more like my sister, and one morning after my bilateral mastectomy she text me and asked how I was doing. It was a bad morning, and so I was honest with her. I told her I felt terrible, that this was the worst thing I've ever gone through, I felt useless to my family, and perhaps putting myself through all these surgeries, chemo, and radiation was a mistake because I felt so terrible that I couldn't imagine going through treatment. Her response was don't give up, and just think when all of this is done you'll have nice tatas and a flat tummy. You'll be so hot. I know she meant well and was trying to find something positive from this ordeal. I let her have it. I told her there was nothing positive about this situation. Yes I'll have new boobs, but they are boobs with no feeling, with scars, and multiple surgeries. I rather keep my flabby belly than have to endure another surgery that is going to take 6 to 8 weeks to heal from. I am going to lose my ovaries and be put into menopause at the age of 36. I am going to have hot flashes, sex may become painful, and I'm going to have to worry about bone loss, my metabolism is going to slow done and it's going to be hard to lose weight. She apologized and she said I'm sorry I have no idea what you're going through. It was at that moment I realized no one has any idea what I'm going through, except other woman and men who are going through this too. I thought I understood the effects breast cancer has on individuals because I watched my grandmother and my mother battle this disease. I had no clue what they were truly going through, until now. I had no idea of the anger and fear that they were facing. I think back and wish I would have done more for them or been a better granddaughter and daughter. My poor mother watched my children so that I could work and complete my RN degree, all while she was going through chemo and radiation. How did she do it? How did she take care of 2 toddlers while battling breast cancer? She didn't have to do that. I was grateful of course, but now I realize exactly what she facing and the strength she had. I am so angry some days. This is not fair, not for myself or any of you. Will I ever feel normal again? I feel like my body and my scars will be a constant reminder. Will I live the rest of my life in fear of reoccurrance? Will I live to see my children grow up and graduate, get married, and have children? When will this cycle end? When will they find a cure for this awful disease that kills so many people every year? A disease that took my grandmother at the age of 53 and my mother at 52. How can I be positive? This is genetic. I'm receiving the same drugs my mom received 10 years ago. Why is it going to end any differently for me? That's my vent for the day.",
