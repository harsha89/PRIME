My MRI is not scheduled until this friday, so basically all I know it the type of cancer.  The nurse that called and gave me the results had me write it down and said I should google it.  So I did. In the search I found information on skin sparring mastectomies and nipple sparring mastectomies. So I emailed the surgeon who I will be meeting after the MRI and asked him if they do that at Kiaser.  I got a call back from the nurse who gave me the biopsy results and she told me they don't do that because it's cosmetic and they are more concerned with saving lifes.  She commended me for my  research :/  She also told me I would not know the stage and grade of the cancer until AFTER the surgery! I flipped! How the heck do I know what type of surgery I want if I don't even know how \"bad\" this cancer is? So I asked around, and everyone I have talked to who has had cancer told me they knew BEFORE the surgery. Is this just the response of a new nurse or is it Kiaser?  If the doctor tells me the same thing I'm thinking I better find a new insurance plan before I let anyone cut me up.  I understand I jumped the gun asking about nipple sparring surgery as I don't know if it is to close to my nipple, but for cosmetics to not even be considered scares the crap out of me. Last time I checked I was a complete person. Being ALIVE yes in number one, second is what damage will be done to the look and feel of my body. Am I going to look like a freak show with Frankenstein boobs and still have to go through chemo and look like I am from a pink floyed video?  Or should I get the lumps removed and just deal with looking like Pink Floyd. Why the heck can't cosmetics be a consideration also? I breath, think and feel - seems all those factors are important! I don't know where this cancer stands yet. So I don't know even what options are best for me.  And YES my LIFE is first, second is my abilty to care for my kids and work (which is why I would like to avoid chemo - I'm a big baby when I have a cold let alone feeling tired when I have a job that requires me to be awake and alert) - and third my boobs are important! THis might be too much information but Brandon can give me an orgasm just by what he does to my breast.  Yes, I admit it, I love my sexual relation with him. Losing that is a BIG bummer!  But I get it, I will lose that sensation, ok, but do I have to look like Frankenstein in the process?  I need to stop googling breast reconstruction photos because it is giving me nightmares!  I'm leaning toward having both breast removed and with any luck avoiding chemo.  But If I have to do chemo anyway maybe I can spare my boobs and my sex life. But how do I know if I don't know the stage and grade? And what was the biopsy for if they couldn't tell that information from what they already took out of me? Why do they have to cut it all out to know? Dx 1/4/2013, ILC, Both breasts, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 0/2 nodes, ER+ Log in to post a reply",

I already know I am going to live, so why the heck can't I consider the other effects it has on my life!  I emailed the doctor but it was the nurse who replied.  I hope to God the doctor isn't that way. I applied for medical assistance today because if I have to I will switch care facilities. I could only get Kiaser insurance from my work. So if all else fails at least I can see someone else. Even if they tell me no after looking at my situation at least it's considered. My neihbor had the nipple sparring surgery and she has been cancer free for a year now.",

However I did the whole google of breast reconstruction images and it looked like a night mare with scares and patches and nippleless features like frankenstein.  That on top of no hair or eyebrows or eyelashes and dealing with not just a flat cheast because they didn't want me to have reconstruction right away and the scars on my flat chest was too much of a nightmare for me to handle.  If I knew I would die otherwise I would go through it and have a better attitude about the way I looked but just to do it not even knowing if it was neccessary in my case was not something I could handle. Yes I am a woman, yes I care about my appearence and no I don't think my looks define me as a person and no I am not all that pretty, I'm just me.  And every part of the outside of me was about to change and it freaked me out.  And despite Brandon telling me I'm beautiful and it doesn't matter if I don't have breast or hair or even estrogen to keep up my sex drive he would still love and would still think I'm beautful - it would affect me still.  It's not just about life it is about the quality of life for me and my sexual relationship with Brandon is a major part of my inner joy.  It's hard to explain. Of course I don't want to hurt anyone or say something to hurt someone who is going through this but I would be a lier if I said I wouldn't feel completly horrible and feel horrible about my appearance. Would it stop me from living NO but it would make me very sad and even more insecure then I occasionally get.  You will hear a lot from the newbiees going through this such as feeling like a freek or frankenstein and yadda yadda yadda, please be understanding and KNOW they don't want to hurt anyone they just have to express how they currently feel at the level of their treatment. They in most part will hide alot from their loved ones but to the women hear going through what they are going through I hope they always feel free to express their true feelings because only then can they get through it to the other side of feeling like a freak into feeling bald is beautiful and chestless is still sexy.",

I have been eatting so much these past two weeks that I have enough skin on my belly to make 3 boobs :) Brandon says I can only get two though :(",

The oncologist said she wanted to start me on the most aggressive chemo treatment.  Neither one of them know what stage my cancer is or if it is in my lymph nodes. Their decisions are based on \"standards\" and my \"young\" age and that it grows with estrogen and one is 3.1 cm.   I in a very nice way said HELL NO!!!  There is no way I am going to go through the nightmare of breast removal/no reconstruction/ and intense chemo and radiation when they don't even know what STAGE of cancer I'm in or wheither or not it is in my lymph nodes and/or if it has spread outside of my breast.  I can understand the extremes when and if the cancer turns out to be spreading but no friggen way am I going to let them turn me into a freak show for a \"standard\" form of treatment when they don't know what is going on IN ME!  I will do what I have to do to live but I have no faith in these people when they want the extreme and this could turn out to be a low grade cancer confined only to my breast in which case removel and immediate reconstruction can be done.  They do NOT see a whole person and worse they don't even know the whole cancer story that is playing out inside of me and want to bring out the big guns.  Am I wrong??? I made them run more test and will not let them touch me until I have all the information so I can determine the treatment that will kill this cancer, keep me alive, and maintain my life as one big WHOLE.  So I did the P.E.T. Scan right after meeting with them and then if neccesary will do a lymph node biopsy BEFORE any surgery or treatment is determined.  The doctor wanted to do a lymph node biopsy before even running the PET Scan and lucky Brandon caught on to that right away and asked why he was putting the cart before the horse. So PET was done and when the results come in Brandon and I will go from there on our choices.  Extremnist that go in with little knowledge of the case at hand are not good in any line of work...uuuugggghhhh  They had an intern in the office with them. The same intern for both doctors. Congradulations they impressed their intern with their extrem treatment wants but the sure as shit didn't impress me when they couldn't even tell me if it was really neccesarry for MY case!",

I can only goto Kiaser because of my insurance.  I want to change doctors but I also just want this to get done and over with. To: PHILIP NEFF, MD From: Michelle Skolyak Sent: 2/11/2013 12:23 PM MST Hi Dr, Neff. How long would the delay in reconstruction be if no cancer is found in my lymph nodes? I need to know what is going to happen on the 21st so if the mastectomy is going to be done without reconstruction I need to find where they sell the bra inserts. And if the reconstruction delay will be a long time even though there is no cancer found in the lymph nodes I need the information to decide how to proceed. Also, I need the research information on this type of cancer as far as the likeliness of spread if chemo is not done. If it hold a high chance then I would like to go ahead and get the mastectomy done the 21st and start the chemo shortly there after so I can get past this year as quickly as possible. When they called me and told me they found cancer and gave me the name of it she flat out told me to google it. I know several people who had breast cancer and none of them had to fight to get information from their doctors. I don't understand a lot of stuff in this case. This may be just another day to everyone at Kiaser as you have many cancer patients but you all need to understand this is new and very serious to me. I feel like Brandon and I are alone out here fighting this cancer and not getting help, information, or any support from Kiaser.",

I have ILC and it's in both breast. The doctor doesn't know the stage yet but based on google I'm a stage IIa. The doctor wants to cut off both breast with no reconstruction, radiation, and \"the most aggressive chemo treatment available\"  So no boobs, no hair, eyelashed or eyebrows for about a year.  I'm searously leaning towards telling him NO because I don't want to be treated for something that could or could not happen (that the cancer shows up again in a diffrent part of my body) but I wonder if my vanity is causeing me to risk an early death.  To boot I got some kind of heart problem (left bundle branch block) and had to cancel my lymph node biopsy suregery and do a heart ultra sound. ",

It was a nurse that was calling me back with test results from my biopsy.  I got a call back today from Dr. Neff's nurse. She had breast cancer 12 years ago. She was awesome to talk to!  She got my surgery scheduled for the 18th. They will remove both and test the lymph nodes that same day.  After talking to the nurse with experience I decided to go ahead and do the chemo and thus there will be a delay in reconstruction. Dr. Neff is crappy at getting me information that I need. I think when I need advice or information I will call the nurse with experience.",
