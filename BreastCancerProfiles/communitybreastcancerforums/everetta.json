For patients under 50 a score of 20-25 gave a 6% difference but for people over the age of 50(post menopausal) there was no benefit of chemo for that same 20-25 group. Above 25 they didn't really test..for those under 50 one could assume the benefit would be even greater then 6%. But for those over 50 the benefit would not be that great--if there was 0 till 25. And the risks of chemo are harder on those that are over 65. I am in a grey area and will definitely try to tolerate the Ais since they are seen to be clearly of value. You definitely did the right thing and the TailorX study has shown that..being 20 years older it is a harder decision since age made a big difference in the effectiveness of chemo.

I am trying to decide on chemo after a first occurrence but have been told that it is not very responsive to chemo but would be to a Ai and also some have suggested Zometa now for prevention. These decisions are so hard and I agree now is probably the best chance to minimize a recurrence. Were you on Ais initially? I have gotten lots of different opinions (have seen 4 doctors all at major cancer centers and not too much agreement although all think the benefit of chemo would be some but little). I haven't had a discussion on Ais yet but will soon (having radiation now). I did have a BRCA panel done before since my mother died at 64 for ovarian cancer. My sister is BRCA positve and 6 years older then me but never got breast cancer and I who is brca negative did. Did you have an oncotype done and if so what was your score?

I did have a high -.203 mammoprint score but I had a low clinical score and therefore in the US when you have a low clinical score they do not use the mammoprint score. They do recommend it for people with a high clinical score. Age makes a difference. My onctotype was done twice and I had a 27 and 31 high intermediate or low high. I am 68 so they are not recommending chemo but giving me the choice (1-3% benefit). I went ahead with radiation-4 weeks and will finish next week. I am not sure I am past the time chemo would be effective, but probably not but it is harder to get after radiation. Did you have any problems dong it in that direction? May I ask your age range? They recommend chemo for people under 50 where they wouldn't for people over 50 since it is less effective.",

Does anyone know what makes scores higher. Hope your chemo goes well. It is hard to understand these oncotype scores--did your doctor explain why?",

I could not decide on chemo but am now thinking I should have done it. Is is too late or can you have it after radiation (and how long to you need to wait in-between?). Will it still be effective starting it later? Log in to post a reply",
