Then after 3 days I felt a large mass in my breast.. yesterday I've went to the hospital where they preformed an ultrasound. There findings were that it was a simple non vascular fluid collection 2.2,0.7,2.1cm. However, the surrounding soft tissue is irregular and the normal fatty planes are lost.... I'm freaking out. It wasn't hurting at all but over the past 30 hours I'm feeling pain in my armpits and under my breasts. The mass is near my areola at the 9 o clock position but the pain is near where the lymph nodes are. I'm scared I have noticed changes in the skin. But it's not that drastic yet but strange almost like white heads are around it. I don't think I have the orange peel going on but I can notice the hair ducts like you would when you shave your legs. The bruising came and went very quickly. Only a small amount is left but the skin is still slightly shadowed and I I do notice a dimpling around the mass. I'm waiting for the referral from my primary to schedule at the breast surgeon and the referral for a detailed mri. What do you think please I'm so scared Log in to post a reply",
