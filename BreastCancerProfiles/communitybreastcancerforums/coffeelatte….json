Just know you are not alone and that the odds of it being cancer is in our favor until told otherwise.  Reading this forum has really helped me calm down; however, when I get in the car to go to the surgeon, or even get more tests, my legs are like jelly and I can't even see straight.  It is so amazing what fear can do.  I am crossing my fingers for your good news.  I just wanted to jump in and let you know I understand the fear part of this ordeal.",

I was able to follow Wren but I could not find you.  I am so glad you have finally felt well enough to come back.  Your posts are so very interesting and I have learned so much from you. You kept me sane last year when we were going through our surgeries and post-op.  I always looked for your posts as soon as I logged on to this board; they always gave me a good feeling for the day. I am so sorry to hear you have had to go through all of the lung cancer issues. I guess you have had a wonderful cleaning out of cancer and will certainly have a good long life ahead of you so you may recover from all of this stress. Big hugs to you and all of the August ladies!",

Someone here said it feels like tape across the chest and that is spot on. I was referred to a physical therapist by my BS who specializes in lymphedema. Even though I only had one node removed I have had cording and some lymphedema in that cancer side. I told her about the tightness and she said that even though I can't see it there is swelling that accumulates around the incisions and that too can be a cause of that very tight feeling. And just like Honeybair said, she showed me how to gently massage in little circles all around the incisions and under the arms to move the lymph. Also rub across the collarbone area. It is a light massage, no muscle involved, only enough to move the skin. It really does help. I tend to do it more late afternoon and evening because that is when the tightness bugs me most. It gives me relief better than medication; it also helps the burning feeling in my arm and pain where the drains use to be. Those post drain areas tend to hold swelling in my case. The rubbing gets that all moving too. Hope this helps someone else because I was panicky over the tight feeling.",

I am praying for all of us to have B9 reports.  I fear mine won't be (the surgeon said she thought it looked like a cancer) so my second prayer is for strength to handle whatever I get dealt because right now I feel so weak and worn out.  I feel like I couldn't physically make it through treatment.  Scary stuff for sure.

First of all I finally got in last Thursday to see a certified lymphedema specialist.  I was leery after the first 15 minutes with her because she said I did not appear to have lymphedema without an exam.  She said because I had only one lymph node removed and no radiation (she said \"just\" a double mastectomy like it was a skin tag that was removed) that I could not possibly have lymphedema. After I asked her, she did feel my left arm (through my sweater) and said she could feel swelling in the back of the arm, but it was probably surgery related. No, I don't think so after six months. Well, I gave her one more try this morning and I walked out of there barely able to breathe. She did about five minutes of what she called manual lymph drainage and I thought she was going to break a rib.  I asked her if she should be pushing that hard because I had read it should be much lighter and she said nothing short of vigorous rubbing would move the lymph. I called the main office when I got home and transferred to a different therapist.  I actually have a severe headache and increased swelling from the P.T. session. Also, this weekend I felt I needed to get out of the house, so much cabin fever in this weather, so I drove over to Dick's Sporting Goods store and tried on a men's Under Armor Compression T-shirt. I first tried on a medium and it was too large, so I tried to wriggle myself into the small. Oh my gosh, this was miserable.  I was half-way into the shirt and I got a little stuck.  I had my lymphedema arm in but could not get it to go over my other arm.  It was way too tight so I had to really contort to get it back off.  I did more harm than good to my arm by the time I got it back off.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I am 5'8\" tall and about 135 pounds so the medium was way to big but the small seemed to be three sizes down instead of one.  I compared that shirt to a few of the other colors and the sizing seemed to be the same. I was so sore by Saturday night so I got creative and pulled out a rather large Ace bandage that I had used after surgery to wrap my chest area.  It felt good to have it back on and it started calming the pain in my trunk area within an hour.  Unfortunately, it also causes me to get severe acid reflux so I can not wear it when I eat or for several hours afterward. I was really discouraged earlier this morning, but the sun is out and I had the good sense to change physical therapists so I guess I am doing some things right.  What do your guys do to calm down the pain from chest lymphedema once it is really flared?  Thanks for listening, this heavy arm and achey pain makes me feel isolated because I don't feel like driving when it hurts like this.

Lia13 - I am so glad you had a good session with your LE therapist.  She did something that I like and that is take measurements of your arm.  I like how she explained to you what to expect on the next visit and advised you to drink water.  The LE therapist I saw asked me to roll over on my stomach so she could feel my back.  I did so and she pushed a little, announced my thoracic spine was tight and started pushing down really hard on both sides of my spine with her weight in the palms of her hands.  It crunched my neck into the pillow, hurt the mastectomy scars and made my spine go pop, pop, pop. She told me she was not adjusting my spine, but that it was just air making all those loud cracks. I felt like I had just been to a chiropractor for a very strenuous adjustment. Not good. I am paying out of pocket because we have a high deductable so it sure bugs me on top of everything else to have to pay for a treatment that was hurtful. Oh well, I must let it go and focus on better days.  That is why this board is so helpful.  The ladies (and men) here understand the strain of a cancer diagnosis and all the emotional and physical effort it takes to get to be the best you can be after the treatments. I have had some things that did not work out this past week (also can't wear my new mastectomy bras that came in yesterday because they do cause more swelling in the trunk) so I have to chalk it up to lessons learned and move on.  OUT with the bras, in with finding some camis and a breast binder!",

I am sore but the ice packs have really helped.  I can feel I am cut from one side of my breast to the other.  I am afraid to look at it.  I can't take the bra off until Monday, so that is good.  I can't believe how nervous I am about the findings...

I don't feel so panicked and hopeless as I did on Monday.  I feel better knowing others have survived suboptimal PT sessions because my back still hurts from that treatment. And Lia13, I relate to many of the comments your doctor has said to you regarding lymphedema.  The BS said the same to me - you are too thin to worry about it, only SNB so you won't get it, and no rads so no lymphedema. I feel so uncomfortable bringing it up because the BS and his entire office acts like, well we saved your life by the surgery, you should be on cloud nine. I did not have any pain with the cancer (never felt it) so that was certainly a different medical condition compared to the medical condition of lymphedema. I can see it requires a different support system.  Thank goodness I have this website!",

I have found only one position that helps me reduce the swelling. I have to lie down on the bed and prop my swollen arm so that it is above my heart. I make sure the wrist is higher than the elbow and the elbow is higher than my shoulder. I do this two or three times per day for 45 minutes. About 2 or 3 times during the 45 minutes, I open and close my hand 30 times. I was told to do this by a PT who works with my BS. She said that should help with swelling until I can get scheduled to see someone covered by our HMO. It took about three sessions before I started to see a difference. Not only did it stop that dead-aching pain and heaviness but it helped relieve the miserable claw feeling I get under my arm where the lymph node was dug out. My BS said the node was really deep plus I have had two prior (unrelated) elbow surgeries on that arm so I was not surprised when lymphedema hit. I hope you are able to get comfortable and find some relief.",

It seemed I was finally settled with my arm and then this cancer had to show up on the left side.  When I consulted with the breast surgeon, he feared triggering lymph problems in that area so he was considering skipping the sentinel node biopsy.  He said he would only take the node if it was easy to get.  He did remove it and that is the area where my pain and swelling has been centered from the day of surgery.  However, I did not notice swelling in my hand until the first week of January, 2014.  It was that miserable, tight skin and ache in the back of my arm that brought back a lot of miserable memories of the two arm surgeries. Plus I can not see the veins in my chest at all on the left side but I seem the clearly on the right.  The therapist never had me take my sweater off to look. Again, I am so lucky and thankful for this website.  Without it, I would have thought the therapist must be correct because she has the CLT training and I would have probably gone a very long time before getting a second opinion. I love the links you added as it just is another huge mental and emotional help to me at a time when I feel very isolated, anxious and depressed about this situation.  I have a lot to be thankful for (and I am) but pain is pain and it is hard to relax when you don't know the correct way to handle this.  So for now propping my arm and doing gentle massage from the armpit to the breast bone to move some of the fluid out (which it does). I see a different therapist on Monday.  I saw her for three visits right after surgery when I had trouble raising my arm.  She was excellent for that so I am hoping to get some help.  I did not go back to her because she is in the same building as my BS, which is a 30 mile drive compared to the PT I saw on Monday which is a five mile drive.  Funny, the distance seems like nothing now.",

I went to PT hoping the improved range of motion would relieve the pain and swelling, but it did not. Instead it got worse with several of the exercises I was doing at home. I also noticed a lot of swelling around the incision on my cancer side but did not seem to have it on the prophylactic side. I kept massaging the cancer side but the swelling would not diminish. Also, the scar/incision on the cancer side began widening quite a bit from the swelling putting pressure on it. The other side is a nice little line and now the cancer side is a huge, red, mean looking scar. It did not look like that until the swelling put all the pressure on it. I keep doing the elevation with the arm and has helped the pain in my arm; but it certainly is not a permanent fix at this point. I just am so thankful it reduces my pain. I can't thank the ladies here who give such great words of wisdom and sage advice. In late August I was wrapping my arm with an Ace bandage for about four days until I came to this site and read it is not a good thing to do. It saved me from creating a more serious problem.
