      "Content": "Nov 27, 2014 02:44PM MarcelaBR wrote: Janiner \u2013 Thank you. Actually it is kind of a crazy story, I was very very lucky now that I think about it. When I was to have the surgery I had to choose btw a BMX and a Lumpectomy, and since I was only 23yo, no kids, the doctors pushed for the most conservative approach and I went for it. After my lumpectomy I had radiation (I did not handle radiation very well, my skin is still dark, muscle is not recovered, even over a year after), which caused a \"ball\" (felt like a mass) to form around internal scar tissue that remained from the surgery. The docs kept a close eye on it, but that's was all it was: remains of surgical manipulation. So I went on with my life You know that when you're done with treatment and all well you'll have to keep doing periodic tests to make sure everything is fine, right? So, that was me. Every 2 or 3 months I would get mammograms, ultrasounds, and it all seemed great. Last September my doc routinely ordered a breast MRI with the other tests, and the doctor who was in the room with me for the test said she got worried about the area with the \"scar tissue\" and would feel more comfortable if I had a biopsy, just to be sure. I had the biopsy, with the needle guided through ultrasound, waited very nervously for the results. Got a phone call from my MO saying that it was fine, it was nothing, the biopsy was negative and I could relax. Two days later the doctor calls again and asks me to his office for a meeting with him and the MRI doctor, Dr. Ana. She explained to me that she was not satisfied with the results, that the biopsy might not have gotten enough tissue, or maybe it was enough, but not from the exact area that was concerning her, and she would like to do it again, but this time the needle would be guided by a mammogram which would give more precision in my case. I obviously said yes and we did the procedure the next day. Two days later I got the results and it was cancer again. So basically if it weren't for the \"pushiness\" in Dr. Ana's part I would probably only catch this months from now. I literally own my life to her and her competence. Then I had the BMX, very clear margins, nodes negatives, and I was seriously hoping to skip chemo this time but since I was stage III, her 2 +, my onc said no way. So bye bye hair again\u2026 Basically, if I had done the mastectomy on the first place I wouldn't be here, I wouldn't have had to go through the nightmare that was radiation (I hated it), but this is life. \"If I had known then what I know now\" is a phrase that can really drive you crazy, so I try not to think it. I feel that it is not fair sometimes, I'm so young, I'm single\u2026I graduated from university and I was ready to start my life when I had to deal with all of this, so I pushed my life for a year. And now I'm doing it again. How am I gonna get a career, meet someone? Time is passing. I was 23, and now when I'm done with treatment I'll be 26. I feel like this 3 years were stolen from me. But at the sime time I feel like we only get in life what we are built do handle. If this is all happening to me it is because I'm sure I can do it. And every single person has their own struggle right? This is my reality now, I've done it once and I'm gonna do it again. We all are! I think I wrote too much lol sorry\u2026 SCVA \u2013 I do have trouble sleeping, but since I'm already on so much I'm trying not to take anything strong to help with it so some nights I just take Benadryl and it seems to help.. My MO said its fine. As for support groups I have never tried, just talking one on one (witch I do enjoy), but am now considering it. I also try to write a lot about what I'm feeling and read it a few days later. It feels very empowering to so what I overcame. Hope it helps\u2026",

The hair situation is just the worst. If I could give you a piece of advice, just shave it. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do to save your hair now, so don't torture yourself by watching it fall one by one.

First time I shaved my head was one day before my sister's wedding. I was hopping to be able to keep it until the wedding but couldn't, I already had bald spots and didn't want to look sick. So I shaved it and used a wig with my MOH dress...I was so upset! But then after it was done and I was ready and all dressed up I realized my hair was NEVER gonna look as good as the wig LOL. Now this was a wig that you tape to your head, and you can keep for several days, wash it, go into a swimming pool, and everything. It is great if you don't want to keep looking at yourself bald in the mirror. So this is me on my sister's wedding:   After a few months my new hair started to grow, so I didn't want to tape the new wig into the new hair, cause I was afraid to damage it. So I bought a normal wig, and this is how I looked (I'm the one on the right. At this point I had gained about 15lb, that's why I look so different):  After that, I let my hair grow and when it was like 1-2 inches long I got hair extensions. The bangs were those \"fake\" ones that you can buy anywhere. This is how that looked:   And finally I got sick of all the trouble, and my hair was long enough to look fine to me so I took the extensions out and dyed it super blond. This is how long it was 1 year and 3 months after I finished chemo:   As you can see, (at least I don't think so) I never looked sick. I believe we just have to put up an effort to keep feeling \"normal\" and pretty. Unfortunately I did not look good bald. I looked like Gollum from lord of the rings! (haha!) So I did what I had to do. I just posted this because when I first started this I visualized myself everywhere, with my friends, bald, with scarfs, and that was simply not me. I didn't know wigs could look natural, and how many different options I had. And this really helped me get trough the whole thing. And now I hope it helps someone too! I SO respect and admire the ladies who embrace the baldness and don't wear anything but their own beauty, but I just couldn't... Now I'm back to step one...chemo and loosing hair. I tried cold capping and I haven't lost all my hair but lost a lot so I'm wearing a new wig. I don't have pictures of it, I'll post one later. Oh and just so you know, my original hair is the one on my avatar picture! Sorry if this ended up being too long... :)",

This week is \"week 3\", so (besides my lack of hair hahaha) I'm feeling 100% normal\u2026 I go on Monday for my 3rd chemo\u2026 halfway done! You and Erica are also going on Monday right? Seems like we are in sync now. I am actually having chemo every 20 days instead of 21. We are doing that because I'm going to New York for new year's, and I want my chemo to be as far apart from my trip and flight day as possible so I can recuperate and enjoy as much as my body allows me. If I had done every 21 days I would need to have chemo and a ten hour flight on the same day and that would simply not work\u2026 When I found out about the treatment I thought about canceling the trip, but I feel that I need to take care of my mental health the same way I care for my physical health. And seeing all of my friends going for the trip we planned for so long and staying behind (like I have already so many times) would just devastate me, so I decided to make the effort, even if I need to stay mostly in bed for the first few days.

Mine is shaped like and egg, so I'm verry funny looking when bald.. don't have any pics or I would show you! I'm very proud of you for shaving it, you'll see how much better you'll feel without your hair falling everywhere! About the expandors.. since I had radiation, my chest muscle is not what it was anymore, so it is very tight (don't know how else to put it) after each fill. Never had any pain though. Because of this I got to \"only\" 480ml, the maximum of mine, but I also wanted to go a little bigger... I'm very tall (1,80m) so I think it would be a good look and more similar to what I was before. When I do my next surgery I will probably get a little bigger...(can't wait!!!) Chris, I am SO happy that my pictures helped you, that was my goal when I posted them. I know I was googling pictures like crazy before everything happened. I saw that you said you haven't gone wig shopping yet, and that you don't know how or where you'll shave it, right? Well, this is just an idea, but here in Brazil the wig shops will shave it for you, they offer the service, and then you leave the store with your wig already on, they help you put it for the first time... Well that's how I did it and honestly it was the only way I felt comfortable, because I had no one to do it for me either and I didn't want to go to my usual hair salon, it would have been too depressing for me. You just have to do what feels right for you and makes you suffer less... keep strong, I'm thinking about you! Leslie, I never had any bleeding, but I know chemo can sometimes make it harder for the blood to clot so maybe that's why. I got a tattoo 3 weeks ago and had minimal bleeding so I guess I'm not having this problem this time around, but the other time I had nose bleeds that wouldn't stop for a looooong time because of chemo... but I would ask my doc or even the chemo nurses... SLCSandy - thank you so much! I hated it too in the beginning but now I know that it is just part of life... anyway, it'll be over soon, right?

No worrying about taking care of hair, styling, or anything like that\u2026 and when you want to look good, just put on a wig and voila! I would LOVE that! I'm not feeling anything yet this time, but the other time I had chemo I had serious chemo brain and didn't even realize it until it was already fading away\u2026 Like the day of my last chemo infusion for example\u2026 a lot of my friends went to my house afterwards to celebrate that I was done with treatment, but I barely remember who was there, what we talked about and what happened\u2026 a few weeks later was when I realized this! Another thing.. I would wake up and be sure that it was a Wednesday for example, think about what stuff I had to do, plan my day in my head, only to realize a few minutes later that it was not Wednesday, it was Thursday already\u2026 very confusing. But for me it was mostly memory stuff. And it went away like 3 months after I stopped taking the drugs. Also one other thing that I haven't mentioned before\u2026 On the six months of the previous chemo I gained 15kg\u2026that's about 30lbs\u2026 the dexamethasone really builds up an appetite and I just couldn't stop eating\u2026 but since I started taking the drugs again I feel like I lost a little bit of weight.

So.. a little about me: I'm Marcela from Sao Paulo, Brazil (sorry for spelling mistakes!), I'm 25 yo and was first diagnosed when I was 23 (anyone around my age here?) ... I had neoadjuvant chemo (4 rounds of AC, 12 rounds of TH), lumpectomy, radiation and was done. Lived happily for about one year and then the cancer was back. This was two months or so ago. I had a bilateral mastectomy and am now doing TCH+Perjeta (6 rounds). All my other scans are clear so its a local recurrency. I felt mostly normal during my first chemo, not many SE, but now it is a new story... I've just had my second infusion and feel like every SE on the list is happening to me :( . I think it'll be good to have people who understand what I'm going through to talk about...most people feel sorry for me and that's definitely NOT what I want! I tried cold capping but my hair is almost gone...went wig shopping yesterday and found one that feels close to my previous hair... I'll post pictures later!

Hoping that by the end of this year all of this craziness is just a vague reminder of how strong we all are!!! Sooo... there was a lot of action while I was gone here so I won't even try to respond to everyone cause it would probably get confusing... I had my port put in on dec 21st. I went smoothly but to be completely honest, I have the scar SO much... but there is nothing I can do about it so I won't stress... Right after Xmas I had chemo number 4 and it wen't as ok as chemos usually are... The usual side effects were there but got better just in time for my new years NYC trip! I have to say, it was the right thing to do, not to cancel the trip. I needed the distraction and even though it was SO sold I loved being out of the \"cancer world\" and just having fun with my friends! I stayed for almost 3 weeks, came back, and on Friday had chemo number 5! Just one more to go, I can't believe it! Today I am kind of in a bad mood but I guess it is just the chock of coming back from vacations to real life mixed with annoying SE... I'm sure I'll be better by tomorrow morning! I read in the last pages someone (lots of you actually) saying that you just want your normal life back...guess that is what I am feeling today... I kept you all on my thoughts while I was away! Hope you are all doing well! I'll be back to posting here more often and being more of an active member now that I'm back! Lots of love to all of you!!!",
