She said that it could very well be changes in my breast tissue but they just want to rule anything out.    I felt \"faint\" when she told me this & sick to my stomach.   I am a 3-time Open Heart Surgery survivor & I have to tell you, \"I felt like the rug had been pulled out from underneath me!\"   And, my husband & I are going on a cruise in 2 wks so I asked they doctor if I could make the appt for the tests when we come back.   She said, \"not a problem -- go & have a wonderful time & then schedule things when you get back!\"    So with that said, my appt is on June 9th for more views.   I know that it's out of my hands & that it doesn't do any good to worry but still.........  Thank you for listening!  Log in to post a reply",
