      "Content": "inunreality wrote: Hello everyone, About 3-4 years ago i had an operation in my right breast to remove an infected lump in my nipple, for about a year now i have been getting strange pains in the same breast but recently they have gotten a lot worse. the pain is a stabbing pain, with what feels like a sharp needle going from the start of my armpit right to underneath my nipple, like inside. the pain then spreads out around my breast and dissapears after an hour or 2. As i have been worried i went to my doctors about it and straight away when he checked he felt another lump, he seemed very concerned about this and was also concerned as i have purple streched marks on both my breast, so he has booked me an urgent appointment at the breast clinic. i have now also developed the pain in the otherside but am unsure if there is a lump there or not they are both getting even very painful to the touch and espshally achy. My left breast keeps feeling extreamly heavy and achy, they both also get hot and sometimes very itchy-espeshally my left. i never have regular periods, they come every 4-6 months or more.... and am 18 im starting to get very worried about it but am also worried i am just over reacting as it could be scar tissue maybe....  Does anyone know what this could be??  Any advice or anything is very much appriciated! thanks so much everyone!!
