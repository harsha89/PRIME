I have a positive medial-posterior margin and dcis within 5 mm of anterior margin. I need re-excision surgery and a snb. I am worried about getting clear margins with the re-excision surgery. I would like to hear from someone who had a positive medial-posterior margin and clear margins with the second surgery. Does anyone know the % that I will get clear margins with the re-excision surgery?  I was just diagnosed on Thursday, so please be understanding about me being so worrisome. Thank you.

I would appreciate all the support that I can get. My breast looks ok now, but I am worried about how my breast will look after the second surgery.
