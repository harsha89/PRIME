Right now, I don't think I've fully processed that my baby sister is no longer in this world.  She had such a strong lifeforce, I can't believe it's gone.  I've learned so much from her, she is my hero. Thanks for lending some friendly understanding eyes.  I will have each and everyone of you in my thoughts, prayers, and now my heart. ",
