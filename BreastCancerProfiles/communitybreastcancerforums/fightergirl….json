This was after two mammograms, three ultrasounds and an MRI. They didn't see any node involvement until surgery, and all four nodes removed are positive. I meet with oncology this week locally, and get my second opinion next week. I can see how they might underestimate the size, but it just seems so drastic to go from less than 1 cm to almost 3 cm. My fear is well, are other nodes affected? How can I tell? Will they be removed? I only had a lumpectomy a few weeks ago (remember, it was initially less than one cm!) but it didn't produce clear margins, so I'm going to need surgery again anyway. I'm nervous about treatment, but I feel like the last two months or so have been such a roller coaster of emotion and information I want to get this show on the road.

But I have seen posts here on breastcancer.org of women who have received Perjeta after lumpectomies, so I'm hoping it will work out. The hospital is looking into it. I've got everything scheduled, echocardiogram, metaport, etc. for next week, including first dose. I do have a second opinion Monday at a MAJOR cancer center 1.5 hours away, which I may switch to.

If you can get your doctor to give you something to help sleep or for anxiety that will do wonders and give you time to weigh your options and to make the best decisions for yourself. Will you see an oncologist before surgery? That might be a good idea, to talk about the ENTIRE process. It may seem overwhelming, but getting the full picture does help. Don't settle on your docs either, work with a team you really really like. You know something has to happen, so once you ease into the situation and you are able to look at things a little easier you'll see that you can and will get through it. I was diagnosed in November, up until Christmas I was in a very dark place. I've started treatment this week and emotionally better now, although I literally just started chemo. Because I have a plan. And you will have a plan. And once you start that plan your goal will be to GET BETTER.

Drink a ton of water, you'll want to flush the drugs out of your system. If your mouth becomes sore, vanilla ice cream and Italian ice were my go-to treats. Chocolate just tasted off for me. If there's a show you have been meaning to watch, binge watching ANYTHING takes your mind off things a lot (I got through all 7 seasons of the Good Wife.) Have lots of hats handy - I had my sleeping hat, my morning hat, the hat that didn't make me feel too hot... you catch my drift. Chemo is scary but it's doable. You will most likely NOT get sick, the nausea meds are very effective. Oh and if you can exercise DO IT. Even if it's a walk around the block.

PCP last weeks said it was a tension headache. Spoke to the MO last Thursday, she didn't think it was anything but made me promise her that I would tell her if it didn't subside. Over the weekend the tingling got more persistent (waking me from sleep) - so she ordered a brain MRI today. When I met her in the office she didn't see any physical symptoms, which was reassuring, but being HER2+ and locally advanced, I am starting to freak myself out.

I was getting mammograms every 6 months for two years for \"calcifications.\" Next thing you know I'm stage III. I thought of calling a lawyer but I haven't had the energy to dig into it. I still might, but from what I understand all of these scans are subjective. It's funny too, my team at DFCI and BWH insist on all scans, treatments and surgeries down there in Boston. When I first got my second opinion at DFCI they REDID all of the imaging and biopsy samples. When I asked about why they were redoing it all the reasons were vague, that they liked to have their own staff review everything. But it definitely made me wonder at what the local place missed. meg - re: PALLAS - I thought that was only HER2- candidates but I could be completely wrong. May want to ask that.

I've spoken to my midwife about an oophorectomy vs. OS (she has also been my annual lady doctor for the past 16 years.) She told me at this stage in my life it's six of one, half dozen of the other, it's more about what I'm comfortable with. My MO said the same.

There really isn't any advantage for them to stay, unless I really don't want surgery. My ER level was also 90% according to my path report, so I'm not really low risk for any stray estrogen floating around. I'm sorry Mom that the surgery wasn't easy for you.
