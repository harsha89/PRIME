She told me to come back and I did a few months later and since it was still there she recommended me for a sonogram . I got one and they said they found a mass most likely a fibroadenoma but recommended a biopsy to be sure . My doctor then sent me for another opinion at a specialty breast center, who then biopsyed it and the doctor said he's almost certain it's a fibroadenoma but recommended a biopsy to be completely sure. He said it had many characteristics of being beign but the one side looked a little darker so he just wants to be sure . He told me multible times not to worry and that it'll be okay! They rated it a 4A I got a biopsy and the results should come back in a few days im just really nervous and worrying. can anyone share similar stories that it turned out being benign ? thanks in advance !
