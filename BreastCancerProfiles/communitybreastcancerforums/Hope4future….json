      "Content": "May 13, 2010 08:53PM - edited May 13, 2010 08:57PM by Hope4future Hi, I just found this website and group and very thankful.  I had a double mastectomy April 27th with reconstruction.  (Sorry I don't know abbreviations yet) I had my first check up with the surgeon yesterday and he removed my drain tubes. Not painful just a gross feeling.  I am wondering if anyone feels like when the skin on your neck is tight?  I see the oncologist the last week of May for my full path report and the nurse said he would tell me then if I will need chemo or radiation.  I have not had any yet.  So I am so new at this I don't even know if I put the right diagnosis on my profile.  I just know I had a spot on one breast but because of family history, brca and I had thyroid cancer with lymph nodes involved that I needed to have a double.   They did take 2 lymph nodes and they were clear.  I will have my first fill next Wednesday.  I will be 43 this Sunday and have 4 adopted children.  They are 11, 8, 3, and 2.  My 8 year old said Mom that Dr. must be good they are already growing back :) Thank you in advance for all the support!",

Does it hurt to get a fill???",

They wanted to admit me into the hospital for same day etc. So I stood up for myself and talked everyone in the office to give me some pills to make me sleepy and a local.  (They usually need to run 3 IV sites for any surgery because my veins don't thread/blow etc. and I throw up from anesthesia for days).  Are you all ready for the news it was FAT!!!  ok they are sending it to the lab but the PS truly feels it is fat and it was definitely not a lymph node as everyone thought.  So the nurse says during the surgery this is the only spot of fat on this girls body....the PS says I know.....and I wanted to say....that is because my Onc. made me take Zyvox last week,,,he he he So am I happy yes - but I know I can say this here and u will all understand without judging me.  I am also frustrated that the worry, pain, medical bills, etc. seem to never stop.  When estepp I believe said I have had enough I am standing right next to you sister!  I have to give my PS and his team praises.  From the start he said during the exchange which will be at the end of July I will take it out.  I am not worried about it at all.  He said I will do what you want and what your other docs want tho.  So the rollar coaster ride began and I ended up at the beginning.  But it was nice to be awake and see the look on the PS and nurses face when they realized it was fat and nothing serious.  They do feel they do care and they were as excited as I was to find out it was FAT! I have been thinking of you all and praying for you all......just wanted to give an update.  With love Kyleen",
