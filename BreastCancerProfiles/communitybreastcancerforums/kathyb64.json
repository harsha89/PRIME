I may opt to pass by the radiation, as the taxotere in chemo has been like throwing bacon on a grease fire as to my RSD. The radiation therapy can cause the loss of cells and bone marrow boosters needed. I had a really bad reaction to Neulasta  marrow booster (ER twice in one day). No way I'm am going through that again. I've had three rounds thus far of chemo and it has heightened the RSD. I have three weeks between infusions, so far my cells reproducing on thier own (little help from a steriod - but I could not take that daily either Im diabetic)  it is an extremely painful process. Radiation is everyday - no time span to reproduce on my own. No solutions thus far from oncology.  I've searched high and low for info about Cancer treatment for people with RSD - nadda. You are only the third person I've run into on forums...I think we are lab rats *smile*",
