I am 37yrs old and found a lump in my left breast, on the inside near my armpit which can only be felt when I'm laying on my right side. I check my breasts regulary so I knew this felt different, I asked my husband if he could feel it and he did straight away. I went to the Drs who felt it and reffered me to my local breast clinic. My appointment was yesterday, I had a mammogram, ultrasound and a breast check. The mammogram was clear, though she did say my breasts are dense. The lady who did the U/S could not feel the lump as I was on my back and she couldnt see it on the U/S either. The I then had a breast check by a nurse...She told me my breasts are dense and lumpy...They are a bit lumpy. Again she couldnt feel the lump when I was on my back and she said my breast felt symetrical, but when I turned on my right side she felt it straight away, she fiddled about with it for a bit and then said she wanted her colleague to have a feel...I waited for about 45 mins and then the second lady came to see me, she felt my breasts with me on my back and said theres nothing to worry about and she coulnt feel a lump and its probably hormonal...as I have small breasts (a cup) I'm more likely to notice the lumpiness and she left. I was told to contact them if things were more 'focal'? So, I can still feel the lump and dont know what it is (its been there for about 3 months) and am still worried! Am I being silly? My husband says I should relax as I've had all the tests and they didnt find a lump on the tests and the breast nurse felt it and seemed to think it was ok to let me go. Oh and my boobs are so painful today after the mammogram, I feel like I've been punched, she did re do them twice though. S Should I just sit tight and see what happens over the next couple of months and then go back to my GP or should I just stop worrying!! Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
