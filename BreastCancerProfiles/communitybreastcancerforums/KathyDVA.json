I can barely see the dots and no restrictions on bathing or swimming (plus my adult tattooed children have gotten a kick out of knowing I now have tattoos). I had reconstruction surgery almost two weeks ago and am scheduled to start radiation treatments on July 18. The plan is for 30 treatments. I too have that nagging feeling of concern but I'm trying not to focus on it. Our daughter is getting married in September and I'm hoping the side effects will be minimal so I can focus on the big event. I'm glad to be through with chemo and have been told that radiation is easier than chemo. I've talked to several people who have gone through radiation and it seems everyone reacts differently. I think a key is to communicate with your RO and staff. Try to stay positive! Kathy",
