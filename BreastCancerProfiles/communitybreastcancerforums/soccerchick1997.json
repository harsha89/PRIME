I was completely fine last night and when I woke up this morning I started to get in the shower I noticed this lump on my right breast on the inside (like close to my sternum) above an to the lefr of my nipple. Its a weird shape (like not a circle) and has bruising around it and I knew I hadn't hurt my breast in anyway and its really sore and painful and strange and it hurts really bad and just appeared over night and like it's red around the lump and hot (like if I feel the skin) and I'm afraid to get I checked cause I honestly just am scared! I also don't want to worry my parents and (this might sound crazy) don't want my mom or dad to be the one to take me to the doctor (don't ask why I have no idea myself) and I'm a minor so one of them has to be there. Any advice? Log in to post a reply",
