I was just fitted today for my first bra and prothetic.  I feel like an old lady and I'm 51 and single (which makes this worse).  I never wore a bra that was so damn high cut.  They are so high maintenance as well.  Placing them in 'containers' every night before bed.  UGH I can't accessorize either.  However, several weeks ago I saw a woman wearing a plain white t-shirt with a pretty scarf.  I would have never though of wearing a scarf with a t-shirt but it looked really nice. ",

I asked for my prescription back as well or even a copy.  She told me that when I was ready for more bras, I should come back there as she would hold onto my prescription.  I thought, OH NO I WON'T.  I see my surgeon in a few weeks and will tell her when I'm due for more bras, I want another prescription so I can take my business somewhere else.  Thanks for your replies.",
