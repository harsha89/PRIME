I had a scare last summer, and despite the fact that my pathology results were negative, I discovered that I am at higher risk. You ladies have been a tremendous help to me so far :) I see many of you take DIM, but I've read conflicting information about it. Can anyone share your dosage and how often you take it? Also, have your MOs shared any opinions about it, positively or negatively? I'm having a hard time getting any straight answers from my doctors about supplements. Thanks so much!
