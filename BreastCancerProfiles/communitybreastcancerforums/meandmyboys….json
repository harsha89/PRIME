I have been on a round of antibiotics, because they thought it might be an infection, but I have not seen any improvement and feel like the sensitivity has gotten a bit worse. I am hoping to get in to see a specialist soon since my Ob/Gyn does not have any answers at all. No, I do not have a Mirena IUD, in fact I was only on birth control for 2-3 years when my husband and I first got married, but have not been on any type of birth control for about 12 years. I hope we all can get answers soon and would love to hear any updates as things come up. ",
