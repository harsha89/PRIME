As far as sugar, it's limited and we have stevia plants around the house we use the leaves from for drinks and teas. We just want to increase the odds as much as possible around here.",

Why do they need to mention every person they have ever known that died from cancer? Why is it an event to tell us the new person who got cancer? This is the lead up to the boiling point I reached tonight. My mother, in her infinite wisdom, thought it would be no big deal to give my wife's phone number to someone who my wife doesn't even know that just got diagnosed with breast cancer so she could call and talk and ask her questions. Wouldn't any logical person think that at least a call to see if this is ok would be a good idea. I found the situation to be rude and now my wife is stuck in the middle of something she would have never agreed to. She does not embrace the pink, she is not the breast cancer guru and she (like everyone else) never wanted to be in this situation to begin with, let alone talk about it constantly. Don't get me wrong, some people are the complete opposite and that's fine but some common courtesy would go a long way. The thing that really puts me over the top is that my mom has cancer herself, why doesn't she talk to her and answer her questions?

She also had an unclean deep margin of less than 1 mm. She bounced back from surgery very quickly with no complications. From there nothing happened aside from weekly tissue expansion until radiation started on 4/10/2017. Two and a half months later. We are told she won't start hormone therapy until two weeks after radiation ends. The MO stated that studies have shown that mixing the hormones and radiation have messed with the effects of treatment. I've brought up these timing concerns and the fact that of being on hormones during radiation. None of the doctors seem worried about my concerns which I take as a good sign that I'm just freaking out however I just dont see anyone else here on that same path. I also don't know if we should ask about more chemo, or what the best plan of attack is. I'm no doctor so I don't know for sure and it's the Cleveland Clinic so I assume they know what they are doing. She even had her case put in front of the tumor board and they all agreed on treatment.

His plan already involves trials so I'm sure something will come of that. We are just shook right now because we were expecting better results given the clear PET scan. It's still possible that the IM node is not involved so there's that. Thank you for recommending the proton beam. I'll see if that is available.

We don't see the oncologist again until Wednesday so it's possible more chemo might happen. I'm not really sure. As far as second opinion we did that at the beginning of this process and ended up going with the Cleveland Clinic. I have confidence in their abilities, I just have such fear for my new wife.

If you have high ER positive cancer this seems to be pretty common for chemo not to work great. Your main tumor did shrink though and I'm guessing the nodes already were affected. The main thing is, it's out. My wife's tumor was large and 6 nodes had cancer. Like you, her tests showed nothing after chemo which is still a good sign in that it isn't active. It may not be a total response but depending on your markers the chances of complete response from chemo are probably slim anyways. The main attack for most is the surgery. The chemo, radiation, hormone therapy are generally in addition to that to lower your recurrence chances. As far as age and kids. My wife is 39 and we have no kids as we are newly married. Cancer was our one month wedding present. So we have decided when we are ready, to go for adoption. There are plenty of women your age that go on to live normal lives. In fact, even though I'm just guessing on your stats, more people than not in your situation make it through to the other side. I repeat, most people diagnosed with breast cancer die from something else. You can do this. My advice is to be aggressive, be informed, ask questions, educate yourself on your unique situation, live a healthy lifestyle and enjoy life whether you have 60 years or 60 minutes. If you have questions don't be afraid to ask. I'm constantly educating myself to better serve my wife. Her oncologist laughs at how prepared I am at each meeting. The way we look at it is, if we can keep chopping away at the risk of recurrence percentage then eventually we will get to zero (that might be a stretch but that's the goal). Sure for some, chemo only increases the odds by 2 percent but what if you are one of those people in that 2 percent. That's everything. Wishing you the best.",
