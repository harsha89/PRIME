But I have very dense breasts and a number of areas of concern so it's harder to image. I believe that if you have less dense breasts and they are aware of the area of concern they only focus there and it shouldn't take too long. The mammogram usually directs the ultrasound.",

I find when talking to friends and family I get the standard \"im sure it's nothing \" or \"your going to be fine\" response and it frustrates the hell out of me!! I recently noticed some dimpling on my left breast which caused a bit of a shape change, and my left breast is now noticeably larger than my right, where my right was always my larger breast. The area where the dimpling is feels thicker and feels like there is a small lump there. In addition I have noticed some small areas of dry skin near the dimpling almost eczema like, and my breast itches on and off. 8 years ago I found what turned out to be a large cluster of cysts in the same breast. However this seems and feels different. I have been to my doctor and have had a mammogram and ultrasound, The radiologist told me that I needed further imaging, and recommended an MRI. I have very dense breasts so it makes imaging difficult but the doctor said that there were some areas of concern.. so now I am awaiting to be scheduled for the MRI, I have some high anxiety moments but mostly I'm calm. I know this sounds crazy but I feel very certain that the diagnosis will be cancer. Has/does anyone else feel this way? I feel like I'm just waiting for the doctors to confirm what i already know so that i can get on with whatever is next. Would love to hear any advice or similar stories Wish you all well Log in to post a reply",
