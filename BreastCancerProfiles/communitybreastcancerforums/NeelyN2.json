My name is Neely and I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 30yrs. I had a mastectomy followed by the horrible chemo. I am now 33yrs old and undergoing my 3rd breast reconstruction attempt.  I also did not work during chemo and I have no children.  You are stronger than you think! Chemo or not, I still have my moments when I have a 'melt down'. The chemo will pass and you will see your children grow up! I hope this helped",
