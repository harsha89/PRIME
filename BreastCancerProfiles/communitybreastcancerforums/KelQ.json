I have no idea what decision I am going to make, but I will at least see the surgeon and educate myself before making a decision. Summerspring - I am seeing an oncologist in suburban Chicago, but went for a second opinion at Northwestern (downtown Chicago). Not sure where you are, but seems like they had more cutting edge stuff to discuss when we went to a University medical center/big cancer care center. Best wishes to you ladies as well! Kelly ",

I think there are some unique concerns for oligo women and a lot of emerging research/data to support an enhanced treatment plan for us. I was surprised how little info I found on BCO about it. exbrnxgrl - 8 years, amazing! I'm only 6mos into this, but it's people like you who motivate and inspire me! Seems like our treatments buy us time until the next newer and better treatment comes out. By the time you need to switch again, hopefully there will be something better. No ibrance for you?",

I was diagnosed in January and my metastatic disease consists of lymph nodes -axillary, mammary, supraclavicular, and cervical (extending into my neck - that's the one that made me stage 4). After 3 months on Ibrance/Letrozole, many of the lymph nodes have shrunk up and my original tumor (near the sternum, back by the chest wall) has shrunk in half. My doctor says I am oligometastic and might be a good candidate for surgery. Due to location of tumor, we are talking full mastectomy. My doctor suggested if I choose reconstruction, I would have to be off meds for an extended period of time. If the meds are shrinking up my tumor, do I need surgery? Seems like a huge procedure that may or may not offer extended life. Has anyone ever heard of or had cyroablation? Any thoughts, advice, other treatments. If you are in the same boat, lets chat about it!

My primary tumor is on my chest wall near my sternum and doesn't show up in the mammogram field. Not only have I had annual mammograms, but have had many ultrasounds for benign cysts over the past few years. It wasn't until my cancer had spread through the lymph nodes in my chest and into my cervical nodes that an enlarged axillary node popped up on the mammogram.",
