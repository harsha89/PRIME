I have no family history and really no risk factors other than bad luck. I went into my appt with the general surgeon thinking I'd just need a lumpectomy. After she explained all my options, my gut said to do a bilateral mastectomy. Although it seemed like a lot for a little lump, the thought of 6 weeks of radiation and 5 years of a drug seemed much worse. I have no idea how I would've reacted to radiation or tamoxifen but what if the side effects were bad and I wouldn't be able to take it anymore. Then what? If your gut is telling you to do a mastectomy, then do it. Some may think it's overkill but lots of women have had it for DCIS. You have to do what gives you the most peace of mind. I had my bilateral mastectomy with tissue expanders on Valentine's day and I'll have my implant exchange surgery next Wednesday. It wasn't easy the first few weeks but life is basically back to normal now. I don't think about cancer all day like I did in the beginning. You're in the hardest time now with getting diagnosed and waiting until surgery. It will get better eventually. Hang in there.",

I guess that was good though because I don't think I would've felt my lump otherwise. I was very nervous that they'd find something invasive going into my mastectomy. When it was all over my pathology said my margins were less then 0.1 mm which is close but the oncologist said it was still clear and with DCIS, he wasn't as concerned with the close margin just so long as it's clear. Therefore, I didn't need any other treatment other than the mastectomy. It's a very tough decision to make but once you make your decision, you will feel relief.",

They talked both about neuropathy from chemo and nerve pain from surgery. They found that menthol creams have been helping. She specifically said a 2% menthol cream and mentioned Dermacool which can be bought off Amazon. I looked it up and it's about $40 but seems like it'd be worth a shot. I'm hearing more and more that this nerve pain after mastectomy might be a permanent thing. She said the nerve meds like gabapentin have some bad side effects so if you can get relief from a cream, you'd be way better off. I guess we'll see.",

I had a double mastectomy in February and it went away after probably 6-8 weeks. Those nerves are healing right now and reconnecting. I never went on any nerve medicine. (I wanted it but the doctor's kept holding off giving it to me). My oncologist did say that a menthol cream helps. The cooling sensation kind of tricks your body. I found some icy hot with lidocaine and that really did make it feel better. There's lots of creams out there-just look at the ingredients and make sure it's just menthol or menthol and lidocaine. When I had mine, it felt like the worst scratchy sunburn and anything touching it made it worse. Good luck to you. Hope it helps and gets better soon.",

Even though some will say, you're lucky you caught it early since it's DCIS, it still just really really sucks. Unfortunately you know too much about cancer already having gone through the ovarian cancer and I'm sorry to hear about your mom. I also found a lump in my left breast and after a biopsy found out it was DCIS, I was crushed. I had some people tell me how it's so good I caught it early and I'm lucky i wouldn't need chemo. But I still had a really hard time with the fact that I even had to go through this. I have a 2, 7 and 9 year old. I was so worried how it would affect everyone in my family, job etc. I never did get a MRI because in my gut I knew the only way I'd ever not constantly worry about a recurrence would be for a double mastectomy. I got diagnosed early January, had surgery on Valentine's day and I feel like life is pretty much back to normal at this point. I need one more surgery to exchange my tissue expanders to implants but then I'm done. The very worst part of all this was the time between diagnosis and surgery. The mastectomy was rough for the first 3 weeks and then it just started hurting less. I took 6 weeks off work and probably could've went back at week 4. All I can say is go with your gut. Do whatever treatment that you feel will give you the most peace of mind.",

Of course nurses get it done and my job got the paperwork faxed the next day with 6 weeks written on it. Maybe try that route. I guess if I feel wonderful and am bored at home, I can come back sooner but I'm doubtful that will be the case. Good luck with your surgery. We'll get through this.",

I kept asking about getting some type of medication but the subject always got pushed aside and I never got any meds. Finally my oncologist's PA told me those types of meds can carry some bad side effects so if you can do without them, it's best. She suggested a menthol cream like Dermacool. I found Icy hot for nerve sensitivity (much cheaper than the Dermacool). The ingredients were only lidocaine and menthol. (You would not want to use plain icy hot.) This worked great. I will say I'm 7 weeks out now and that pain has completely gone away. I have heard that sometimes it's permanent so don't know if I got lucky or what. Maybe give the creams a try and then wean off your gabapentin? I'm pretty sure you can't stop that stuff cold turkey but check with your doc for sure. It may not matter since you haven't been on it that long.",
