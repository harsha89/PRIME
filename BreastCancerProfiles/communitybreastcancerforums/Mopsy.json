      "Content": "Feb 22, 2012 05:30AM - edited Feb 22, 2012 05:33AM by Mopsy I have been a Land's End shopper for many years and can attest to the quality of swimsuits, flannel sheets and coats.  Since Sears bought them the shirts are being made with thinner fabric, which people are not happy about.  You can return things at Sears to save the hassle of shipping.  Amputees (of other parts) cross the \"how will I look in a swimsuit\" bridge and go on living, without options to hide the situation.  Certainly some people stare, but it is how it is, just like aging, you don't look as good in a swimsuit later as you did earlier. It depends how much swimming is a part of your life -- be honest -- were you really a super-pool-oriented person?  The swim season is short for most of the country, and it is great that there are so many dressing options once you are out of the pool.  That being said, if I ever lived in a year-round pool climate, I would just love to have my own backyard pool where I could enjoy the water in private. ",
