You definitely have the right attitude, free clothes sounds great!! It also seems like you have a very supportive family. You are beautiful with or without hair my dear! Personally, i was very lucky and so thankful that I had no other chemo side effects ( exercised, worked, no nausea) that I decided hair loss I can deal with. Sure, I miss it but summer is a good time to be bald. Just left Florida. 100+ degrees and humid i sure didn't miss my hair last week! Plus I get ready quicker than my husband. Left my \"lid\" at home lol. After I buzzed mine it slowly started coming in throughout treatment. But I still look like my dad. Illimae, you are a trip! Your pic is hysterical! Breeze does feel good. A guy i work with that has a buzz told me to swim while i have no hair; that the water feels awesome gliding over your head. And people are kind. We went to a concert and asked to pay to upgrade one section. The boss was standing there and said \" put them in the best available\" free. I didn't say a word but guessing it was my scarf. I just choose to embrace that kindness when it comes into my life. I hope everyone has a good day and enjoy the breeze on your scalp, through your peach fuzz, or through your hair today!",

Remember reconstruction is optional so you can choose to do nothing. I had dense breasts so decided on both so I wouldn't have to deal with mastectomy again. However, try not to second guess your choice too much. BMX doesnt give me a pass and isnt always the answer. This disease does what it wants. Ladygrey, keep us posted.

I will also post a pic of the vitamin I got at Walmart. Just check with your Dr. Its growing in pretty fast. Still missing the middle section of my left eyebrow lol. Crazy. Take care everyone",

I just wanted to chime in that I had essentially zero side effects with my 4 rounds of TC. I walked 3 miles everyday. Including chemo day. Took day of and 2 days after treatment off work to hydrate, rest, pee alot lol. Then back to work to a fast paced job as a nurse. I'll admit , I'm the exception to the rule. Just wanted to give you hope. Please feel free to PM with any questions. Joining the chemo January 2019 group would be helpful. I found it additionally helpful to talk with those that are on the same regimen. Please dont get ahead of yourself and worry too much. You will get through it and it will be over in a snap! I will bottle up my experience and throw it your way! Take care! Deb",

My breasts were very dense ( 50% each breast at final surgical pathology) so mammograms would not do me much good and I did not want the extra worry. My cancer had most likely been there 2 years or so by the time it was detected on mammograms due to density. Did not want the chance of fighting insurance for MRI's. Cancer on the left side and I did not want radiation due to potential for heart damage. My understanding is that mastectomy could decrease local recurrence chances but not distant metastasis. So many more decisions to make than I ever imagined, none of which are easy.",

My second treatment is tomorrow and I will drink at minimum 64 oz of water today plus a small Gatorade or juice. Adding a splash of lemon helps. I drink that much the day of through day 4-5. Taper a bit after that but still stay hydrated. Treatment room is cold so bring a blanket ,dress warmly. I over packed the first time and wont do that this time. With my treatment i'm out in under 4 hours. Leafed through a magazine, talked to hubby and nurses. Closed my eyes listened to music for a bit and it was time to go. Light breakfast is a good idea. They let you go to the restroom during but will need to disconnect infusion for safety reasons so I made a quick trip in between chemo agents. I sucked on lemon drops most of the time to to ward off the metal taste. IV shouldn't restrict you much. I brush my teeth after each meal when I'm home and biotin mouthwash works for me. I'm sure u will get an education handout with instructions with a phone # to call with additional questions. GA warrior, Dee...or anyone on the neulasta..how are you all doing? I started my claritin yesterday and will continue thru day 10, that's what I did last treatment. Onco said I could take as long as I wanted. I had zero side effects with neulasta at all. No way to say if it was the claritin but I don't want to find out so I will do the same this time and see how it goes!! I hope everyone is feeling better!💗",

Neulasta and neupogen approval can be tricky with some insurance companies as they consider it \"optional\" for TC treatment and not \"recommended\" as it is for others is one thought as to why it may not have been offered? I had to send appeal letter to get neulasta approved. Hindsight is 20/20 but your wife's hospitalization should warrant it moving forward but I'm sorry she had to go through all this. PICC b4 she is discharged would be great. You mentioned the patch..i believe you mean the one for neulasta. I don't believe they have that for neupogen. The only reason I opted to go back in the next day for the shot is because there is a chance, although rare, that it could malfunction and I wanted to be sure I actually got the med. I live 10 min away from the office and didn't mind driving in. I hope all goes well and your wife is discharged soon.",

Rub it in well all over my hands and feet, focusing on the cuticles. Its pretty greasy but soaks in.

As far as the hair I am doing well there. I take biotin and a plant based hair skin and nail vitamin that I found at Walmart. Be sure you are using a shampoo that cleanses your scalp and keeps it clean so the follicles aren't clogged. That's very important. No shampoo can really make your hair grow. I used Nioxin throughout chemo and to be honest my hair grew ever since the buzz. I will be 8 weeks out from last chemo this Monday. Scalp is totally covered. I'm already ditching the scarves more often. Ask your hairdresser for advice if needed. Engine, I'm glad your wife is feeling better. Take care everyone. Hugs.",

The emptiness the loss of a pet causes in your home is indescribable. Congrats to everyone finishing chemo and or moving on to the next step. With TC done I'm waiting a week or 2 to start with the AI and just waiting for exchange surgery. The pill is on my counter but right now I'm just looking at it!! Take care everyone and have a great weekend",

Your goobers are adorable! Batata, I can picture you facepalming about the weight but good grief our bodies have been through alot! Once we get through the initial period after chemo and start feeling better we can chip away at it. Frog, I hope you are feeling better each day. Duffy, djt, innaB, engine ,GAW , maggie and anyone following this thread I hope you all are doing well and don't mean to skip over anyone. Urdrago, sending best wishes as you wait for results. You mentioned a life plan in an earlier post and it really hit home to me. Working out a few things to make my job less stressful. As much as I love it the stress is just not good. Been going at that pace for 35 years so it's kind of hard to let it go. Just because you \" can\" doesn't mean it's good for you. I've been looking into 'integrated medicine' and thought I would share. I didn't really know it existed..it focuses on the care of the whole person. I am meeting with an integrative physician for a consult to discuss goals ( I have an autoimmune disease so I'm VERY interested in knowing everything I can do to keep a strong immune system). They offer free massage, acupuncture. Nutrition, mind-body therapies to help with relaxation and stress. Now that I'm done with surgeries, chemo I am glad there is service out there that focuses on continued healing. I would assume the larger hospital systems offer this service. I will let you know how it goes. I hope everyone has a good Sunday!",

I heard it's a taxotere side effect and this started for me after my last treatment. Between work and exercising I get in a lot of steps plus the heat doesn't help. By the next morning it's gone but reappears in the evening. It seems weird to just be taking a pill a day and not focusing on chemo. Definitely an adjustment.

Not sure if I mentioned it before but I filled out an 18 page history form that the Dr reviewed before I could even get scheduled. Appt was 2 hours long! I took notes but I left them at work , ugh, so I'll fill you in best I can. My Dr used to be a primary care physician for many years. He decided to go into integrative medicine to make more of a difference. Not just see a patient for 10 minutes, hand out a Rx, and send you out the door. Integrative medicine basically looks at all the factors that influence your health, wellness and disease. He mentioned making the body so it is less of a host for disease. The approach is evidenced based and meant to enhance traditional treatment. He was very big into gut health. Probiotics and prebiotics foods that help the probiotics work better. We discussed nutrition at length. More cruciferious veggies which I knew I was lacking. Not sure I can get in the 6-8 servings a day he suggests but I can certainly improve. Cage free organic eggs, 100% grass fed beef etc. He would like me to try adding trace elements drops to my water which I will consider. Definitely filtered water. Added 1mg melatonin to start. He couldn't believe how little sleep I get. Not good. He was very impressed with the change I made in my job to decrease stress. He said \" people anymore live in a constant state of fight/ flight\" constant stress at my job without a doubt. He said fight/ flight is meant for emergencies only not for our daily lives. He is drawing a comprehensive thyroid panel. Also sending blood out for all vitamin and trace element levels. It will guide us on which supplements I need and dont need. Looking forward to knowing what I need or dont need. I was really impressed with our visit. It gives me a little more control back since this disease takes so much away. I know there is no guarantee but I'm hoping I can make needed changes to optimize my health and feel even better. If you have this service offered in your health system maybe consider looking into it. It was nice to sit across from someone that was interested in my overall health. I'll take it. Sorry so windy!

They expand u quite a bit further than the actual implant. I wanted to be a tad bigger than b4 diagnosis but I feel I look the same. I made my daughter look, she seems to think I'm a little bigger. I guess I got used to the TE size because I was expanded for so long. Anyway, I have the \"gravy\". I have dull sensation on my skin along with nipple sensation. When I'm cold, they are cold. When I'm not, they aren't but there may be a slight delay in response time. It is different but it's ok. My incisions are infra mammary so they are not visible. I was very fortunate to be a candidate for this type of surgery. I just could not go on worrying about dense tissue in the healthy breast. Final path said 50% dense on healthy one, 40% on the bad one. That's crazy. For piece of mind I made the right decision for me. 2-3 months sounds about right for exchange. My PS would not fill until 4 weeks after mastectomy. If it takes a month to get fills in you usually wait a month from last fill b4 exchange. Have u decided pre- pectoral or behind the muscle? Decisions seem never ending. I'm glad everyone is headed towards or crossed the finish line with chemo. Hope everyone has a good night.",

I will share what I learned. Your office is probably submitting an appeal on your behalf. In my case I was denied too. Should that happen to you again this is what you do: Call Insurance company yourself. Demand to talk to someone that can email you the guidelines for Xeloda approval. Plan to be on hold for awhile. It is your right to those guidelines. DO NOT take no for an answer! Offices can NOT get the guidelines but you can. Once you get them there is probably a list of criteria that you must meet to get approved. Read each one carefully. You may only need one of them!! If you find something that may work write a letter to the insurance company focusing on the one criteria you meet. I'm serious, I will help you. I was denied neulasta for chemo. I spent many minutes on hold, got my guidelines. I built my appeal letter around one of the criteria I needed. If the office tells you that you are denied again please call yourself. It's worth the effort. What i learned is that it takes an escalating an appeal before it goes peer to peer between 2 oncologists. Once 2 physicians in the same field discuss, you have a better chance of winning. My insurance admitted it could be YOUR oncologist doing a peer to peer with an OB GYN lol..on the other end asking for approval. Is that not insane??? Once YOU escalate they are forced to make 2 oncologists discuss and you have a better chance of getting approved. Sorry but it pisses me off that it comes to this. I've already decided when I retire that's my calling lol. Write appeal letters. Insurance companies should not decide your treatment. It may not always work but it's worth the fight. Should you get a 'no' from the office again I'll help you with an appeal. This ain't over yet my friend...no more tears just yet. Keep us posted. Hugs!",

It took awhile. To be honest I do a 15 hr fast at night (and that's when I noticed the difference), dedicated to walking at a good clip and it did finally come off as of last week..so a good few months.

It will be funny that we will be rooting against each other for a few hours that day. That's the only reason I would ever root against you!!. Lol. I'm rooting for all of us as we move forward in putting this disease behind us. Frog, enjoy swimming and please post another pic of your unruly hair! Hoping for minimal or no side effects for next monday. LIFE. I hope they can figure out your elevated liver enzymes? Many pain meds are metabolized in the liver is probably why they prefer you not take anything unless necessary. You mentioned it's been elevated after chemo, any chance its due to the arimidex? I dont think it's one of the major side effects but I believe it's possible. Then again, what isnt on that list. Ugh. Please keep us posted. Ingerp, so far my side effects on AI are minimal and I wish you the same. I've been on arimidex for 5 months. I'm on the go from 5am with work, exercise and when I get home I take a half hour nap. When I go to get up I literally feel 90. Its bizarre.!!!! It's only after my nap. I think it's my body in shock because I'm so active all day. Thankfully 15 min later it's gone. I dont feel that bad when I wake up in the mornings. So far I can deal. Enjoy your trip. Getting away is magical. Enjoy. Hi engine. How is janice doing? Omg a home hyperbaric chamber, are you kidding me?! The fires and shooting is just devastating. I hope your community can begin to heal. I cant imagine. Duffy, no shaping at all as far as my hair goes. I use a taffy styling product which helps. I had a temporary color that only lasts a few weeks to tone down the gray. It's not near the coverage permanent color is but my hair is so healthy right now I dont want to start back with that just yet. Its unbelievably thick. I'm hanging on to every hair right now as some struggle with thinning due to the arimidex. I'll cross that bridge if I get there. How are you feeling? Hey miss maggie! I have PS appt today to firm up if I will go through with this 2nd fat grafting next month. Things have settled more. I notice a bit more rippling but honestly I cant complain. Part of me wants to see this through ( covered 100%) and part of me says leave as is. I hope you are doing well! Found a comfy bra at nordstroms and the fitter was very helpful. Djt and and everyone that check in from time to time I hope all is well and sending good vibes. I have my integrative physician appt Tuesday. It's a 90 min- 2 hr appt. Are you kidding me? Not a single provider has spent that much time with me. I filled out an 18 page history form. Looking forward for some direction on keeping my immune system healthy ( I have autoimmune issues) Not sure if this is a one time visit or not. Finding my self at the \"end\" of treatment comes with concerns. I just need validation that I'm on track as far as what is in my control. It was so nice to meet GAW. I told her I felt like I was on a mystery date LOL. If you pictured us yacking away you were right! Time went too fast. A good example that you just never know when our paths might cross. It was nice to feed off of her positive spirit and I hope I did the same for her. We both agreed dark thoughts and worry surface from time to time but as long as they are not in the forefront all the time that is normal. Do something you enjoy every single day. Dont feel guilty about doing something good for yourself. With that said. I think I will enjoy another cup of coffee under my warm comforter and be thankful I'm not driving in this ice storm.

As he gets better I hope you become less worried if there is such a thing. Going back to what Frog said about concentration and struggling to find words. That's me! The words eventually come to me with just minimal delay for the most part. As far as memory I still honestly question whether I listened in the first place. I told my husband if there is something important make me repeat it. There has not been one time..so far..that I've forgotten. Otherwise, I'm probably not really listening! Ingerp your hair looks great. Duffy, hope you are enjoying Florida. Engine, I agree with innaB. Look into the hyperbaric oxygen therapy with your insurance company. High dose vitamin C also promotes would healing. I've seen several threads on that so maybe it's worth searching. I hope janice is doing ok at work and that it's not too stressful. Maggie, hope you are doing well. I'm having my final fat grafting this Thursday. Urdrago, you are cute as a button! LIFE, hope all is well I apologize for missing anyone. Hopefully everyone is feeling ok, getting through rads with minimal side effects. I would expect that is pretty draining. Have a good week! ",

Beautiful family! Your hair looks great. You know temporary color was great. Timed it for a wedding but it's just that, temporary. Lasted 3 weeks at most. What I noticed..and confirmed with honest co workers..that the more hair I have the less gray is noticable. Before it was more the primary color. Now it's more brown with gray highlights. Believe me, I'm no beauty but I'm good with just letting things be as they are. My hair is so healthy, soft , feels so good I hate to use permanent color just yet. I know i eventually will. Plus my curls are out of control right now lol. Its definitely about what makes you feel best! You look great! I'm glad you had such fun time with your family!",

I took care of a 32 year old guy..in for port removal so it was a good day. Colon cancer. Father of 4 including triplets. I pointed to my poodle head and told him I could relate. I'm serious, when people fight for parking spots at oncology offices there is a serious problem. He knows 3 other young men diagnosed recently. I just dont understand it. He was very upbeat and ready to get back to his life. I still feel like the tin man in the wizard of oz ( on arimidex) by the evening. I go so much ALL day long that once I stop to rest then try to get up again my body is like WHOA. I honestly dont think cold weather helps either. I need to start bringing my oil can to yoga class lol I hope everyone else is doing well too. 2 more shifts of my alarm waking me at 3:15 am. More than ready for my new job.

I love when it works out but understand when it doesnt. Your hair looks great. Love the color. I'm glad you accepted the chemo bag. My mind now tends to go to the meaning or intent of the giver. You are obviously special to them. It probably took some time to get it together. How thoughtful. Duffy, beautiful pic and glad you had a nice time with your family! Urdrago, cant help but chuckle when I picture u in the midst of the NFL draft and marathon mayhem lol sorry if I missed it but hope all in well with your CT. Batata, congrats on being portless. Did it go ok?so glad you had good news with your testing. Innab, so sorry about your job. Ugh. That's tough after 19 years. LIFE, what did you mean about your socks? Swelling? Your comment about the curly hair weighing down was timely. I had a hair appt and stylist said if I'm committed to growing out my hair she doesnt want to cut. I need to be patient and eventually curls will weigh down. Part of me like thick and curly hair. I didnt have that before. A wavy bob length would be nice. We have a friendly lawn mowing competition here too lol Frog, simply gorgeous pic. Wow, where in Europe? I tend to stay back when hubby's business trip are in boring places lol. But I am taking along to anaheim, ca in september. Just go with the messy look. I have a product that i put in at the very end that tames the curls. Air drying helps. I also bought a diffuser for when I do dry Linda, hope you are doing well. Engine and janice? I only went back a page or 2 so I'm sorry if I missed anyone. Running a cinco de mayo 5k Sunday. Still absolutely loving my job. Heading to punta cana in 10 days. Inna B, didnt you just do an all inclusive? I hope it's a good day for all. ((Hugs)) deb",

I will be totally honest ... I had zero and I mean zero side effects with the first 2 treatments. Doesn't mean the next 2 will go this smoothly and I will be thankful for the 2 good ones I did have if that's the case. If I wasn't bald I would think they gave me water! In a nut shell, I take the steroids twice a day the day b4 and day after chemo. Infusion day I get an IV drip of steroid and anti-nausea med. I have needed nothing at home for nausea. Slightly constipated and take a colace for that. No diarrhea. I go in for neulasta shot the day after. I take claritin 2 days b4 chemo and continue for a week after chemo. No metal taste, great appetite. I do drink 6-16 ounce waters starting the day b4 chemo for about 4 days then taper off a bit. Treatments are Monday and I go back to work on Thursdays. Walk 3 miles a day even on chemo day. I did not do cold caps. Had my hair till day 23. I do hear that eyelashes and eyebrows fall out weeks after treatment over and some have nail issues. Not looking forward to that. I do not ice my nails so I guess I will see what happens once I'm through. I was told to take anti nausea med at first \"twinge\" of not feeling well and to try to snack frequently. I feel fortunate to have done so well and don't really know why. I just wanted you to know that it can happen. Be hopeful you will do well too and we all can have this behind us soon.",

I was very fortunate and got through TC with virtually zero to minimal side effects. 2 days after treatment was my \"yuck\" day. Tired but couldn't sleep, hungry but couldn't eat, sad but couldn't cry. Just an off day. I kept a log for each round of TC. Hydrated well before and after treatment. I never needed the zofran for nausea. I felt fine. Be sure to take any premed as directed. You should be given some IV prior to your chemo. I did take regular clartin throughout chemo for bone pain with neulasta. I had no bone pain. Walked 3 miles daily including day of chemo. I found it very doable and just took day of and 2 days after then back to work I know you are scared but you may find it's not nearly as bad as you are thinking. Keep track of any side effects and when they happen so you can make needed changes on the next round. We are here for you. I will bottle up my experience and throw it your way. Take care!",

(3 weeks out from last chemo) Now I'm all about making a few changes and continuing my exercise routine. I bought the book that others raved about \" how not to die\" by gregor I believe. What I like is that it breaks down not just breast cancer but other diseases and conditions (hubby has heart issues) . It's a very interesting read and I even brought out a highlighter lol.

I almost went that route but last minute changed to expanders; he felt more accurate placement of implant that way. I didn't care too be much bigger but didn't really want to be smaller than what I was and that could have been the case. I was instructed no repetitive motions after surgery and you may fall into that group in your profession. No pushing heavy xray head around!, pulling, or lifting over 10 pounds. I went back at 6 weeks but was still very careful about what I did. I decided early on that I will look out for myself and that nothing is worth potentially complicating things. Just not worth it to me. Should you find yourself down \"expander lane\" you may have a choice between choosing behind or in front of the pec muscle. Yes, more decisions but cross that bridge when you get there.",

I could so see you doing that for her!!! That way you both will see progress. Even try to get her out again later today. You could log total minutes for the day..it doesn't matter how she breaks up the little walks as long as she gets it in. As she takes more pills and doesn't move she will feel stiff in the coming days or weeks. As she starts feeling better the log will help..it keeps us accountable.

Cleared to start stretching which is good. Thanks for asking. If you are going to PT maybe they can give you hand exercises to help. Ibuprofen daily to get through is fine but not forever as it is not the best for our livers. Arimidex can be tough and you aren't alone with the joint pain. I take a plain claritin since I took it to prevent neulasta pain with chemo. Keep checking the other boards for ideas. Have fun camping! Inna B, I am under the same understanding as you about the lymph nodes .We have 3 \"levels\"of lymph nodes. Each person has a different number in each level. Some surgeons will take a whole level or further if needed depending on each unique situation. So that is why we may see 2/23 etc. Someone else may have 2/15. I guess you just cant tell from that if it's all one level or into the second unless you ask since we all have different numbers in each level. Frog, when is your surgery date? I'm sorry you aren't sleeping and you are not complaining! My family called me Voldemort too. Especially when I do the \"hand\"thing. Now I am even passed the \"stranger things\"stage if you saw that. Lol. I looked like Eleven! If not , Google it lol You will get there. Urdrago, yes I'm driving. No drains with exchange surgery. I had 4 drains longer than I wanted with mastectomy. I had a few PT visits. I made sure I saw a PT that was qualified to do lymphadema screening too and I did get a sleeve. I don't wear it often but will wear it when I fly. I hope neuropathy and eye crust thing is improving. Ingerp. I understand the waiting for the hair. You will get there. Are u taking biotin or a nail vitamin? I'm very close to where people think I chose a pixie cut..not! Duffy, djt. Hope you are doing well. GAW, I hope you got some rest this weekend. I know a few of you are close or just started the AI's. You can pretty much bet on joint pain will happen to some degree. I cant stress how much moving will help and will give you the best chance of success. If you are moving faithfully and still having issues you can always switch to another. Unless you are dedicated..some of us are and some not..log your exercise for the day. Think ahead..and plan your walks/gym/runs whatever around your schedule. Logging will keep you accountable and with time you will want to fit it in. And to be honest we truly NEED to. Take care everyone and enjoy your Sunday!",

I personally feel I am far enough out that I will take it. Our employee deadline at work ( hospital) to take it is Dec 1 to be protected during peak season even though its offered now. I would still consider your past experience with the shot also. The flu can be nasty and we don't want to be hospitalized for that.",

When going through surgery and chemo I felt like I was in that fight/ flight mindset. Focusing on avoiding chemo side effects and following surgical restrictions etc..you know..\"doing something\". For me, I find the thoughts of recurrence in my mind more now that things have settled down a bit and I'm just taking a pill. MO says this is normal. Thankfully it is not that obsessive worry but what I call normal amount of worry that I hope fades a bit with time as members that are ahead of us have said. Enjoying each day and pushing the 'what ifs' out of our minds is great advice. Some days much easier than others. I just don't want to look back and see that I've wasted time worrying when I could have enjoyed my family and friends. ( with that said, off to a college football game with my family!) I will worry when I have to worry. Today I don't have to but I know this could change tomorrow. Thanks for posting engine. Thanks again to everyone one of you. I think DJT once said even though you can't fully keep up with everyone we truly celebrate each others good news and support each other on the bad days. Inna B, did I see on another thread that you have tried acupuncture? If so, could you tell me about it..i know nothing. You can PM me if you prefer.

I'm sure it is draining physically and emotionally. Inna B I'm sorry for your loss. Frog, go topless when you feel ready. Urdrago and everyone that is having limitations with movement please consider PT. I had my drains 3 weeks with mastectomy which put me behind on the exercises. PT helped alot. My therapist said I came for treatment early and she wished others would too..rather than wait. Howz it going Maggie? I will know Nov 15th whether I keep my dec appt for round 2 fat grafting. I'm making my appt today for bra fitting at nordstroms . Engine. I hope Janice's job is not too stressful. I know you were concerned. It does appear immunotherapy is the direction of the future. Just to think of the possibility.of a vaccine is amazing. I just hope it happens soon LIFE, congrats on the end of rads. It could be the anastrozole affecting your labs. Ask at your next appt. There are 2 others you can switch too. It seems to never end sometimes I know Ingerp, try your best to not focus too hard on the side effects of the AI. I had to make a conscious effort to be aware of the major side effects only and will deal when or even if they occur. I've been on arimidex for 4 months. My joints are stiff but movement helps and the stiffness works out quickly. Returning to yoga today. I take calcium and vitamin D also. I do have 2 pretty intense hot flashes at night but I did that with chemo too. No nausea, weight gain so far. I take mine in the evening. I also take a claritin at the same time. I was on it during chemo to help with bone pain from neulasta and with permission stayed on it. I dont want to stop the claritin to find out. I'm sure you have had your dexascan to see your baseline for osteoporosis. However, some do have major side effects. Give it time but by all means do not be miserable. There are 2 others to switch to if needed. Just dont talk yourself out of it before you try it. Duffy, djt, and ALL I have missed I hope you are doing well. Well, I actually dropped my work schedule to 2 10 hr shifts per week. VERY stressful job but I can handle anything 2 days a week. On a 3rd day I work in the fitness center helping with cardiac rehab. Love it. There was no doubt job stress was the #1 modifiable risk factor for me. Alarm going off at 3:15 am everyday is over. Slept till 6am today and feel great. Heading for a walk then yoga. Had lunch with a SIL yesterday that I haven't seen in a long time. Really nice to reconnect with her. That's what life is all about. Try to do something everyday or spend time with others that 'fill your bucket' . It makes for a better day.    ",

I can multitask 3-4 things but not 8+ issues at once like i used to. I know people may have to repeat things to us but we really need to ask ourselves ....were really listening in the first place? Probably not! We are just fine! lol Hi maggie. Good to hear from you. yes having just fat grafting above non cancer breast for a dent on 12/20 Also more rippling as things have settled but mainly when I bend down. I could live without the 2nd grafting but PS says easy fix, not near like last time..so he says. I was diagnosed in January so all treatments fell in this calendar year for deductible. I'll just see this through. I wasnt kidding about making a change. Today was debbie day lol. Took breakfast to a friend that just had surgery, got on my treadmill, on to yoga, shopped for an hour then accupuncture. Then I napped. Dont feel the least bit guilty. I'm over that. I hope everyone has a nice weekend and that you make time to do something for yourself. Because if you wont, I will!! Hugs.Take care, deb",

Coworkers so supportive and appreciative, I'm still a resource for them. I feel like my mind was in a bee hive after chemo is the best I can describe it. I surrender. Waved the white flag. I go back to the biggest take away from integrative appt...\"fight or flight mode is for emergencies only\" We should not be living our daily lives in that state. And I was for 8 hrs a day which left me for no reserve when I got home. I hope your recovery is going well. Things definitely keep settling dont they? InnaB, how did your integrative appt go? Ingerp, let us know if you get response from the other thread about the eyelashes. Maybe those that are out of chemo alot longer than us will chime in. Right now I'd say mine are shorter than before. Nails acting funky now too so I think I'm in one of those 'cycles'. Beautiful day here today. Going to the zoo to see Christmas lights this evening. Hope everyone has a great Sunday. Deb ",

LIFE, last round of fat grafting. Sore and bruised but a bit easier than last time. I had a dent above non bc implant. Almost was going to let it go then decided what the heck, see it through. PS said the skin had adhered to the implant and causing the dent. He took a letter opener like tool to separate. The implant wasnt gliding under the skin like it should. Needless to say, I'm glad I went through with it in case it would have caused problems down the road. I had a temporary color put on once beginning of November. Only lasted 3 weeks. I cancelled Dec appt. Hair is thick and out of control curls but it seems I have less gray. I'm still just going with it but probably need to finally get it cut in January sometime. I hope everyone has a good short week. My wish is that 2019 will be good to all of us. Deb",

I'm 7 weeks out this Monday and doing good in that area so far. My bone scan had a comment \"young normal\" which made me chuckle. Maybe visit a few of the other AI boards and see what others are doing for joint pain. Many seem to take glucosamine. I was already on the claritin because of neulasta after chemo so just stayed on it. May I ask how your energy level is and how active you are right now? If you are not where u feel you should be yet I would want to do anything I could to prevent the joint pain. Exercise exercise exercise is a recurring theme you will notice.

In August, wonderful. I hope everyone is doing well. I'm looking forward to keeping up with you all a little more since I took some extra time off work. I'm so glad everyone is winding down with this part of treatment. I wish I could hug each one of you in person.",

I was exactly 7 weeks out from last chemo and you can see the long hairs when you zoom in. I'm coming in dark with more gray than before and you are a blondie so it may seem to take longer to cover the scalp. I used nioxin shampoo throughout chemo and still do. Just be sure you are using one that keeps the scalp clean so the hair can come through. Everyone is different as to when the right time is to lose the headwear. I probably felt comfortable sooner than most. I worked with a girl years ago that had her chemo curls poking out of her wig. She could barely get it to fit over her head. She finally ditched it soon after. I would look constantly too just like you are! Now I'm actually washing hair. It's coming in pretty thick but too short for chemo curls just yet. GAW. Glad you are feeling better and going thru with the next 2 treatments! ",

GAW, so agree about how this disease hits you later on. That's where I am now and why i thankfully could take a 'bonus' week off from work with this exchange. Once treatment slows down there is more time to think. It's hard to explain. Best of luck to you tomorrow and InnaB too. Seems like Wednesday is the big day for everyone. Healing thoughts to anyone that I missed. Djt, you are funny. It seems like I'm in a group if blondies! I was always dark so I'm sure that's part of why it shows up more. I've used the biotin shampoo to keep scalp clean and alternate a plant based hair and nails vitamin with biotin. My hairstylist was helpful in guiding me to the right products. Off to the trail then stopping into work to meet with bosses. Transitioning back to work makes me uneasy. Love my coworkers and my job. It's just very high stress and super fast paced. Iove that but know it's not the best thing for me anymore and that's difficult. Trying to find that balance I guess. Hope everyone is feeling well. ",

Remember all this chemo is cumulative so right now it would make total sense that you feel this way. Be sure you are staying hydrated and rest when you need to. Consider talking to your onc about vitamin supplements. B complex is one that comes to mind. I was the exception to the rule and really didn't feel too fatigued. I still take a short nap everyday and I'm over 3 months out from chemo. When you do feel good, take advantage of the time. Otherwise just give yourself a break and a little more time. It will get better!! Drop in any time and congrats on being done with chemo!",

They put me on the books for a 2nd round of fat grafting in Dec for insurance purposes but I guess I will know today if that's a go. I'm still tender in the belly area. I've been stretching and hoping today I can get back to the light weights and start back jogging again with a supportive sports bra. Its hard to believe I've been wearing a bra to bed every night since Feb 12. Hoping one of these days maybe you dont have to?

If their is any creative way for her to take even something SMALL off her plate? It may make a BIG difference.

Decreasing the stress may make a difference in other aspects of her life. Is there anyone at all she can ask? I'm sure she is very valued in her role. I feel for her..and you ..on this. I'm mad at myself for not changing sooner than I did. I'm very fortunate that the nursing profession provides so much opportunity. Not everyone has the flexibility I have but something had to give. Thinking of you both GAW good luck Friday. I'm sorry you have this thrown in the mix too. Im sure you know but these surgeries are not difficult, just tedious, sometimes lengthy. Not so much lengthy if pathologist is on site. Maybe you want to get your holiday photos first GAW. Either that or find a red nose and antlers for the pic. You are so darn cute anyway it wouldn't matter. Hugs and best wishes. Inna B. Best wishes at work. Let us know your day goes. Just clarifying..did you mean \"fasting\" when you mentioned restrictive eating? I'm very interested!. I did a 13 hr fast for around 3 weeks to drop the last few lbs after chemo. I felt better. Forget why I stopped. Like you, the weekends thru me off but 5 days a week was easy. There are studies out there that point to decreased recurrence chances with fasting.

And I fully understand not everyone can make the changes like I did. I'm fortunate. All I can suggest is take advantage that she can work from home. Maybe she can sneak out for a walk on those days.

I wavered a little bit which is normal but all things led me to stick with my decision. With dense breasts I could not deal with all the testing on the other breast. Fighting for MRI with insurance when mammos clearly don't pick up cancer is something I didn't want to deal with. Of course, cosmetically the results would most likely look better. Not sure where you are with things but maybe nipple sparing is an option on your healthy breast. I just had my final exchange and things look ok but still bruised and swollen. Flap surgeries were off the table for me anyway. It is such a personal decision. Just know it's normal to waiver a bit, it's not an easy decision. I must say, when I was handed my final path report ( very strange thinking pathologist was dissecting my breast) it was a relief that no other cancer was found in either breast. Very thankful. Had there been it would have confirmed my decision even more. One of those things you just don't know for sure unless you go with BMX . Continue to ponder and research. Hugs to all",

Walking 3 miles a day. I left work early ( nurse in pre-op) came home and took short 2 naps. I do get the neulasta shot after each treatment and done fine there too and I do feel that helps. Everyone is so different with how they respond but in general it seems like most are blah days 3-7 then feel better. There are always exceptions of course. I honestly wish I could bottle up my experience for everyone going through this as it has not been bad at all. Take care. You will find a lot of support here!

My reasoning for BMX was that I didnt want to go through this again. I had dense breasts and didnt want the worry of future cancers possibly being missed. My relatively small tumor had some aggressive features. You are right. It's a sad and difficult decision. I do not regret my decision in the least. No matter what any of us do cancer can still come back. I have a normal amount of worry but dont obsess about recurrence. I was a candidate for skin sparing, nipple sparing and cosmetically had a good outcome. Yes, there is loss of sensation but not totally. Nips still respond to temperature change and there is still some sensation. I'm only mentioning this so that should you choose bilateral maybe there are some options for the healthy breast as far as keeping the nipple, inframammary incision etc. I wish you the best in making your decision and again I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.",

Mountainmomma is right. I have an onc appt this friday. I feel myself a little more anxious this week. I also agree, not as much loss of feeling as I expected too. There is so much to understand and so overwhelming. Your PS should lay out all of your options. Also, keep an open mind. I knew before I went in I may be direct to implant or wake up with expanders. Tissue perfusion and blood flow is determined in surgery. I trusted my PS to make the best decision at the time. Many here also get second and 3rd opinions.

Eyebrows are back to normal now and there are more eyelashes each day to put mascara on. To me this was absolutely no big deal at all. I used a clinique and Sally's product for the brow and no one could tell. I hear this happens in cycles so I'm keeping my products handy for the future.

As frustrating as it is I do know it was in your best interest that the anesthesiologist cancelled your case. He very well most likely saved you from a less than optimal outcome. Heart failure can come on quickly..even since you saw your cardiologist ( as you know from your ER visit) you could have ended up on the vent and sometimes it can be difficult to wean once you are on it Cardio and pulmonary need to see you again. You didnt mention any other meds but often patients are put on ACE inhibitors/ARB's if you want to research. It's so important and that you are optimized for surgery. Please go right back to the ER immediately if your symptoms resurface between now and your other appointments. Please update when you can. I'm so so sorry for this added stress.

I asked for a MRI last year but I didn't meet \"the guidelines\" which includes 2 direct female relatives with breast cancer and had no other risk factors. Dense breasts alone are normally not enough to warrant an MRI unfortunately guessing partly due to cost of the test. Even had your mom gone at 6 months it still may not have been detected. As others stated most breast cancers are slow growing. Moving forward should she choose lumpectomy you can inquire if they can alternate MRI and mammo. The waiting is one of the hardest part of this journey. When diagnosed we want the cancer out now. I remember my surgeons words who also had breast cancer \"while it is life-threatening to us it is not a threat to life\". Time is needed to formulate your care team, seek second opinions, and further testing. You will find much support in this forum and she is fortunate to have a daughter that cares so much.
