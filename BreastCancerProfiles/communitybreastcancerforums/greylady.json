I was diagnosed stage 4, mets to spine from the get go. I had chemo first, then bilateral mastectomy,then radiation. In between chemos, they did radiation to my spine. Now I take Arimidex and 10000 units of D to help with joint and muscle pain. I am 68. From day one, I decided to be grateful for whatever time that I had. Being older, my children are grown, even my granddaughter is 20. I tolerated my treatment well. My team at Shands was terrific. Another big help was and is great health insurance. My wonderful husband was with me every appointment(it helps to be retired). I had great family support. My sister had stage 2 breast cancer 10 years ago. She was and is my go to person for a spirit lift. I want to thank all the stage 4 ladies. You were my partners on many sleepless nights",

      "Content": "greylady wrote: Hello All, It is so great to find this forum. I am stage 4 with mets to spine. It has been a long rode just to the complete diagnosis. Last years mammogram was negative so this is an aggressive cancer. I am starting chemo this week, cyclophophamide and adriamycin for four rounds then taxotere for four rounds. I have to have neulasta the day after treatment. I have the literature on the chemo but was wondering if any of you have had this regimen? Any information would be appreciated. I am going to Shands in Gainesville Fl which is an hour away. We are thinking of staying in a hotel for the tx and the shot. I will eventually have radiation to my spine to help with the pain. It is so helpful to read the stage 4 topics. Right now I don't feel brave just scared. Dx 7/6/2011, IDC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 6/13 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I am having pain in the thoracic spine. I was really leaning toward hormonal therapy only but the onco consulted with another onco and they feel I should do the chemo so I consented.  I will check out the chemo forum. ",

The onco expects a good response from chemo, there is only a !% chance of cure. That is one reason I was leaning toward just hormonal. I am 100% positive for estrogen so hormonal shoud work well but then aggressive cancers do well with chemo. So I decided to go with chemo then surgery then hormonal. My head is spinning from the learning curve.",
