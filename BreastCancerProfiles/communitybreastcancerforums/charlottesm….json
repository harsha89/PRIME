I don't know why, maybe because I live in central NY where the temp dropped to -8 last week, I can only picture myself in one of those fur hats with the ear flaps. I figure it will keep my head warm and nobody will know I'm bald! Also, trendy right now and there's a guy in town who sells REAL fur hats and said he'd give me one! Oooh! Maybe a mink! Otherwise, yeah, hats for me. ",

Not a wig grrrl, so I stuck with just baseball caps (which I hated until I needed them!).  So, almost immediately after my last A/C session my hair started growing.

I am still up in the air a little about whether to do the recon, but if I don't, I will at least get my chest \"cleaned up\" and made flat, as I had skin sparing on both sides. With a year to go before I can have my surgery, I am at about 50/50 either way. My husband just wants ME here. He just says they are not allowed to touch the booty. ;) ",

It was this past Tuesday, 2/8, and was not at all traumatising, despite some issues with my port. Ate some pizza for dinner, took my meds went to bed, woke up feeling just fine. Had my Neulasta shot the next day. Did the Claratin thing and regular doses of Tylenol and so far have felt no pain. I'm on day 3 (2 days after chemo #1) and feel pretty good. No nausea, no pain, no loss of appetite or weird tastes/smells. I went for a brief bu brisk walk in the cold sunshine today and it felt great. I just ate some steak and a big pile of sauteed spinach, trying to keep the iron levels up. I heard Cream of Wheat cereal is good for iron--looks like the Farina version is best. I'll try that in the morning. I've also been doing the Senekot and LOTS of water and have had no probs with constipation. Rinsing with baking soda and water (also, if you swallow it, it will help with heart burn), and using Biotene. Chewed a lot of ice during session #1. So far no mouth sores. I'm still expecting to get hit by the bus any day now. But just wanted to post a positive experience so far. Cheers, Michelle ",

      "Content": "Feb 11, 2011 10:54PM - edited Feb 11, 2011 10:54PM by charlottesmama I second Ruth's recommendation on getting dental work done prior. I had a good cleaning. Doc found a cavity and took care of it right away, knowing that chemo was coming. I just wash my face with warm water (no soap) and found a nice non-greasy unscented moisturizure: BWC (Beauty Without Cruelty) 100% vegetarian, which I am not, just like the product. I also use pure coconut oil on my lips, around eyes at night and on hands through out the day. It's solid at room temp, but melts at body temp, has no scent and no other ingredients. Have nurses make up a chart for you with meds (include generic and Brand names) when to take each day. Add your own (I added Senekot, Tylenol, Claratin) and tick them off as you go. It's a lot to remember! Add your clinic nurses/NP/Onc and BS phone numbers to your speed dial and cell phone. Carry a warning card about fever/nutrapenia in your wallet or wherever it may quickly be found in case your temperature spikes and you need emergency care.  So far I'm feeling great. Woke up super early this morning, couldn't get back to sleep, so have been watching episodes of Chopped and drinking hot cocoa! Take care, all! Michelle ",

I read all the November and December 2010 posts, as well as the January 2011. You know what? The anticipation is the worst part. At least it was for me. If you're reading the previous months' threads, you know that the chemo \"cocktails\" and their side effect are different for each person. Here's what I can tell you about my chemo experience: I had 4 rounds of dose dense A/C every two weeks. Other than losing my hair, I had no side effect worth mentioning. Now, about the hair. Yeah. You're gonna lose it. Not fun, but it WILL grow back! I know that's a panacaea, but just think about all the bald or balding men you know. Their hair is NOT going to grow back! I cut my hair super short (picture Jamie Lee Curtis) and donated it. The rest fell out in the shower 21 days after my first chemo \"date\". Yeah, I was freaked out and cried, but pulled on my big boots and hustled off to the salon to have if shaved. Not being a wig girl, I've just worn a funky baseball cap out and about (check out cafepress.com for some fun \"cancer\" hats), and recently, with my VERY sparse growth have opted to go topless! It feels pretty good. Even kinda sexy with the wind ruffling the little baby bird feathers on my head, and caressing the bare skin. So, hang in there May sistahs! It sucks now and will suck for a few more months. But it's gonna get better and you're gonna kick cancer's f*cking ASS! Peace on y'all. Michelle ",
