I don�t know a thing about Ultrasounds however the pictures the tech was taking consisted of a cluster, not one cyst or one nodule. Well from all I�ve read and advise from a few others I am going this Tuesday to see my Primary Dr. because this in no way �feels� right and I don�t believe it to be the course I can live with anyway. Question is? How to I just get to the point and ask my Primary to PLEASE take this serious and get me into a surgeon. I just don�t understand how in 2007 they can ask this of me.

Yes, the indention is there without compression, it just made it longer & deeper. I can not feel it, I'm a 38DD with lumpy breasts anyway but this clearly shows up as something all together different. Just lucky they found \"it\" early what ever it is (was not there 2 years ago/compared the 2) I just find it hard to believe that when some bc doesn't show up on Mammo or Ultrasound their hands are tied for understandable reasons, however when it's black and white and \"unknown\" they would wait. Go figure!",
