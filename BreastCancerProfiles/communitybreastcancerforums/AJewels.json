I'm so concerned and worried about my sweet little girl.. We're going to the doctor this Saturday because my daughter wanted to wait until the female physician was in the office. Both my grandmothers died from breast cancer and my mother has found lumps in her breasts, but I had no idea that breast cancer was possible in such young children until reading these posts. I pray that both are daughters are just experiencing something normal..please keep us posted .",
