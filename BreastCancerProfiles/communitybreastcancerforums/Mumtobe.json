Have 7 more infusions left before chemo ends but my veins gave up so got my port put in yesterday. I can honestly say it is more painful than the MX I had in Sept. Is it meant to be this sore?

I was never aware of any lymph node activity until diagnosis but since the end of my first bout of treatment I am super aware of it, yet it feels less tender to the touch than not to the touch, if that makes any sense?? Any feedback would be great, thanks ladies :)",

I too was diagnosed during my pregnancy, in fact I'm still pregnant (32 wks today) and I am looking at getting to full term thank God. I was diagnosed at 20 weeks. We only celebrated our first wedding anniversary yesterday. I know my husband gets more angry and worried than I do a lot of the time but I guess he's looking on at the two people he loves most in the world and can pretty much do nothing about this horrible diagnosis.  The one thing I will say to you is that this is doable. The initial news and tests were definitely the toughest part for us to date but once a plan is in place you feel you are making progress towards killing this horrible beast.  I have completed 4 rounds of dose dense A/C tx, overall I have been feeling really well during chemo. I am having my mastectomy in 2 wks time. Your wife's pregnancy will keep her fighting strong, as it has me. I am fighting for two people!! Hair loss isn't the most pleasant thing to go through but look at it this way - once your wife's hair is gone, it means the chemo is working, try to embrace treatment, it is saving our lives! I am based in Ireland and got an amazing wig and I'm sure your wife will too. If she has long hair then I would advise to cut it up short now so that it isn't as traumatic when it falls out. You might feel helpless but believe me there are many things you can do for her now. My husband cooks for us, runs all our errands, does the housework (my sister and mother help there too), and basically just keeps the house ticking over. Make sure there is food in the fridge for her, make sure she is eating well & drinking lots of water, let her put her feet up, she needs lots of rest now. They are all things I did prior to my diagnosis but as the treatment and pregnancy take their toll on my body, I don't have the energy and its such an ease to know that a meal will be cooked for me or the house will be cleaned. They sound petty I know, but they are important. Be good to yourself too, sleep is important for you. Make sure you get a good nights rest and eat well/take plenty of vitamins. You will need to be fighting fit when your baby arrives. Most importantly think positive! I don't know if you are a religious person but we have found such peace in Jesus and Our Lady. Pray every day to them, if you don't pray, then you might just have a little chat with them, there is such healing in prayer. Take very good care of you, your wife and your beautiful baby who will bring such joy into your lives. Please keep me posted on how she is doing. Would love to hear of your baby's progress. xxx ",

I finished my 4th round of DD A/C tx last week and my eyebrows & lashes are beginning to thin now. I will be starting on 12 weekly doses of Taxols in 6 weeks time (after my baby is born) and my nurse told me that my hair will begin to grow back while on the Taxols because the dose isn't as dense. Did anybody else have this experience? Is the hair regrowth just fuzz or does your hair really begin to grow back properly. I am just so sick of wearing my stupid wig, i hate the stupid thing but I live in Ireland and with the weather we have it does help to keep my head warm :)",

My exercises for the past week have been going well and today I am meant to be able to raise my arm up over my head which is proving very difficult. What I find is the sensation is coming back into my arm, it had been numb the past week but now I can feel it and it's sore but I persevere and I can straighten it (not perfectly straight), if it's pain you feel keep pushing through the pain but if it's just that you cannot straighten it then I would contact your hospital's physio and they will sort you out. I'm sure it's nothing to worry about, everyone reacts differently in the aftermath of surgery.",
