I started to experience left hip pain on and off more than a year ago. Had whole body bone scan Apr2016, pelvis MRI Jul2016. No lesions. About a month ago, the pain got worse, had another bone scan, report said abnormal uptake in left femur. Follow up MRI found lesion in the same area. Getting a PET tomorrow. Oncologist still thinks it is very small chance that it is bone met, because of my type of BC (DCIS with microinvasion), but I know I can be that tiny percent. Oncologist said it may be very difficult to biopsy the area where the lesion is located, if PET does not show anything else, we may just do radiation. I remember seeing some discussions here about why some bone lesions get biopsy some don't. I would think it will be better to know the tumor biology in order to have a good treatment plan. I know if PET shows other lesions, it will be different story Appreciate if anyone can share information about bone biopsy or similar experience. Thank you.",

For blood test, my Onc does not really believe in tumor marker, plus I was DCIS microinvasion, he never tested my tumor marker. I will see what the second opinion is and decide the next step. I heard that PET sometimes can be false negative, so may need to prepare for bone biopsy.",

For med, I think there are some requirements, I don't remember exactly, seems that you should not take supplements like Vitamin, calcium etc. the night before or the morning of.",

I wonder what kind of chance it is that lesions in bone scan and MRI turn out not to be a met after other test (such as bone biopsy). Or anyone whose PET scan is negative but later turns out to have met after biopsy. I had these three tests done due to hip pain. Bone scan shows abnormal uptake, MRI shows a lesion, but PET is completely negative. Not sure if PET is falsely negative or the MRI lesion is really not a met Thank you.",
