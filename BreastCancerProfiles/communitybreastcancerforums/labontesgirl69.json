When she ordered my tests she noticed that I would be turning 40 in two days and suggested my forst breast x-ray. Last Thursday, I had it done and the radiologist requested several magnified shots of my right breast as they saw calcifications. I was told that this is common, but since this was my first mammogram they had nothing to compare the calcifications to so I should come back in 6 months rather than 1 year. I got a call from my gyno yesterday and she would like me to see a surgeon as soon as possible as there are a few spots she did not like. I have an appointment with a surgeon tomorrow a.m. I am just wondering what I should expect from this visit. My head is spinning at this point as I assumed all was okay after talking with the radiologist. I amÂ  scared and confused at this point. Have looked this condition up on the net and it seems each site has something different to say. Does anybody have an info they would like to share? Log in to post a reply",
