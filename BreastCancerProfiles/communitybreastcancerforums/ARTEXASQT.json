I was just curious because I DID ask at my last infusion and they said I'm getting 140 mg of Taxotere and 1,200 mg of Cytoxan. Which, according to everything I could find, seemed awfully high. I'm a \"big\" girl, but dang...almost double?",

My Neulasta injector shifted or something, so not sure if I got any or not on Saturday. And, my son had a baseball tournament all weekend so I was outside a lot. I noticed yesterday that I have a tick bite on my arm. Hopefully nothing comes of it. But my oncologist is going to check my bloodwork again Wednesday to make sure my counts are not bottoming out and that there's not any infection from the bite or being around all those grubby little ball players all weekend! LOL Funny how I don't usually bat an eye at silly little things like tick and mosquito bites, but now I have to be a little concerned. Oh well...summer in the south!!",
