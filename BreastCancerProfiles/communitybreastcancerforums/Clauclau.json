I chose to save the nipples because of the location and safe margins after BC was removed. Nipples have been dark and they are bleeding sometimes. I don't know how it's going to be after a month or two... Right now I am more concerned about chemo and side effects. Your chemo drugs might be the same as mine, but how is your regimen? And for how long? Good luck on your recover. Many positive thoughts and blessings in your way.",

      "Content": "Jun 15, 2016 12:44AM - edited Jun 15, 2016 01:05AM by Clauclau I was diagnosed with Triple Negative mammary carcinoma Stage 2, grade 3 , 2.5 cm, on 5/12/16 and I was referred from the gynecologist to a BS on 6/9. My first thought was that I would have to wait to hear what the experienced doctor had to say about it. Well, blame it on my personality ( or maybe I was numbed by the news of having BC) , but I wasn't antsy to know more details about the cancer. When I talked about the results of my biopsy to my husband, sister and close friend, they were all unanimous to say \" look for ANY oncologist to explain what this cancer means on you\". Without knowing exactly what to say, I called Scripps ( my network) and requested a visit with any oncologist that could translate to me the pathology test. I was also curious about what steps to take first to start treatment. I am glad I listed to my family and friend. I was first put in contact with the Radiologist Oncologist ( I don't know at this point if I will need radiology treatment after the surgery), but he was, by far, the best teacher in cancer subject that I could ever had asked for The man sat down with me and my husband and patiently started making drawings of cells, existing cancer types, stages, grades, treatments and surgery options for the type of cancer I got. He also ordered a MRI, a PET scan, a Bone scan, and made a referral to the genetic counseling to expedite the process involved. He finally told me that I would need to find an oncologist and a surgeon to be part of the team. I walked out of his office very confident that I would have a successful outcome. By the time I met with the breast surgeon on 6/9/16, I was equipped with the most valuable thing I could have to make good choices: INFORMATION! I learned that there are lots of choices when it comes to dealing with cancer. Some cancers type will allow you to have more choices that the ones I had with triple negative. In my case , I was given the choice of chemo + surgery or surgery + chemo. When I met THAT first surgeon on 6/9/16, she wanted me to have the surgery first and then chemo, but she didn't listen to me. I was going towards chemo as a neoadjuvant treatment first, and she totally disregarded what I had to say about the situation. I didn't have a good feeling about her practice and I got another surgeon for 2nd opinion. Needless to say she will not be my surgeon.... I am now happy with my doctors and the treatment plan choices that we decided together. There is one more doctor to add to my team, and I will meet him tomorrow I was told I need to have a plastic surgeon for my breast reconstruction working with the breast surgeon. I am leaning towards DBLMX followed immediately by reconstruction. I guess my advice to you is that you don't have to WAIT between diagnosis and treatment. Don't wait to get informed about your situation, and get as much information as you can. Be ready to understand what it is happening to you and your body, and take control of the situation. The doctors will help you to make the best choices for you and for your lifestyle, but you need to feel comfortable with the choices . The thought of having cancer is very scary at first, but keep in mind you are not alone and there are several people out there going through similar situation at this moment. I am impressed with the amount of information and support out there, from great stories of survival, encouragement and resilience... Don't forget to think positive and believe that you will get through it. Good luck to you, to me and to all of us.",
