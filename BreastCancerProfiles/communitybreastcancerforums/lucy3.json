I ended up with an infection a week after my surgery, treated with oral antibiotics and then started radiation less than 2 weeks after the infection. I had 30 treatments and my fatigue started after 3 weeks. My biggest challenge was not being able to sleep at night, thus increasing my fatigue symptoms. I was working full-time as a Director and had my treatments every morning at 7:30 before work. By week 4 I was exhausted. I was forgetting things and had a hard time staying focused. It also affected my emotions. I tell you this, because it took me too long to give in to the fact that I was going through a major physical challenge in my life and I did not adjust it accordingly and put myself first. Once my doctor ordered me to cut down on my hours and start napping during the day, I was able to sleep at night after about 7 days. My fatigue persisted for about 2 weeks after my treatment, however, it progressively improved during that time. I am 3 1/2 weeks post-treatment and I feel great. I still have a lot of breast soreness, however, my energy is back! If you are going to be going through treatment, start by taking care of yourself and putting yourself first.",

The radiologist spoke with me right away and (with no bedside manners) said \"I'm ging to be blunt, you need to have a biopsy\". Talk about going into shock, there was no reassurance offered and I left there with an appointment for a core biopsy 2 days later and lots of questions and worries. I had the core biopsy (did not go well) with a clip placement on that Friday. The results came back the following Tuesday afternoon and I was diagnosed with ALH and told that it is a \"marker\" for breast cancer. The frustrating thing for me was that I had no idea what ALH was, I have absolutely no family history of Breast Cancer and I was told I would more than likely need an excisional biopsy. With so many questions I was then not able to see the Surgeon for 6 long days.  When my husband and I meet with the surgeon he said they'd do a Breast MRI and if everything came back normal, then we'd discuss my taking Tamoxifen as a preventative. He did not recommend the excisional biopsy. I finally received a phone call from the Surgeon 2 days after the MRI and he said it came back normal. I would be needing to have both a Mammogram and a Breast MRI on an annual basis and I was to come back in a month to discuss whether or not I wanted to begin taking the Tamoxifen.  I'm feeling confused and unsure of what I am suppose to do. Do I really need to take Tamoxifen? Don't a lot of people live with ALH and never develop Breast Cancer? Is it really that big of a deal? Would it be safe to just wait 12 months and see if the spots change? I'm thinking I need a second opinion, but will I don't even know what I'd ask them. Should I just forget a second opinion, skip the Tamoxifen and move on with my life? Can anyone share some advice with me? Help! With Extreme Gratitude.

Is this something I can request, even though I don't actually have Breast Cancer? I'd much rather see someone who treats patients exclusively with Breast Cancer and other Breast conditions to get advice on what my treatment plan should consist of. I'd love to hear if anyone else has been diagnosed with ALH around the age of 40 and if so, what has been the result of your follow-up mammograms and Breast MRI's? Have you taken Tamoxifen, etc.? Any information would be appreciated.",

The Gail model takes into account five factors including your current age, age when you started menstruating (menarche), previous breast biopsies- -also taking into account if any of those biopsies demonstrated atypical growth, age at first live birth, family history of breast cancer in first-degree relatives. One of the disadvantages of this model is that it doesn't take into account age at which a family member was diagnosed and whether the disease occurred in both breasts -- early onset and bilateral disease suggests a BRCA mutation carrier. If the Gail model predicts a 5-year risk of 1.66% or greater, you should consider discussing the STAR trial (if you are post-menopausal,) or possibly tamoxifen with your doctor. This entails a balanced discussion of the risks and benefits of these interventions- keeping in mind that nothing is without risk !! The Gail model doesn't apply to women with LCIS (lobular ca-in-situ), DCIS or if you have had a previous breast cancer. Remember the Gail Model assesses the probability of developing breast cancer, not dying from it. This information is from: http://www.breastdoc.com/My_Breast_Health/Gail_Model_Description/Gail_Test/gail_test.html Both of my surgeons used this. ",

She was amazing! From her knowing everything about me and my case right off the bat, to her very thorough education with me. As Anne wrote in her the previous reply, I do need to have an excisional biopsy to rule out anthing more serious and am scheduled for that next week Friday. On another note, according to the Gail Model, I am currently a 1.5 vs. the 1.7 needed to be eligible for the Tamoxifen. Though that could change after my biopsy, my previous Surgeon offered this to me and was asking me to make a decision as to whether or not I wanted to take it. This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that a second opninion is always worth taking the time to get. I will keep you all posted, however, if anyone has something to share in the meantime you comments are always welcome.",

I did not have an easy time with the Core biopsy, due to numbing issues. When I got to the hospital on Friday, they gave me a small dosage of Valium, just to take the edge off and I have to say, I felt very confortable the entire time. Placing the wire was much easier than I ever anticipated and they put me under for the actual biopsy procedure. I was worried just like you are and I wished someone would have assured me before hand. I also have to say that the Valium was a good idea by my doctor. She told me that these procedures should be as stress free as possible for us and she's right.  Now I just wait for my results. I will hear back tomorrow. I am more stressed out today than I was on Friday before and after my procedure. I'm just praying that my ALH diagnosis stays as is and that they don't find anything else. Michelle, be sure to tell the staff tomorrow that you are nervous and scared. They are trained to help you with that and make you as comfortable as possible. You don't need to be a hero. Let them take care of you. Good luck! Laurie",
