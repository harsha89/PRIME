When I found out that oncologists make ALL of their money by selling chemo drugs at a huge markup, I knew I was in for a heck of a sales pitch, and I got one. People tell me I have an \"adversarial\" attitude towards my oncologist, and I do. At this point, I trust no one. My (famous) surgeon took me thru 2 surgeries, and didn;t do this incision she described either time. The only instructions I got were to avoid\"lifting my own weight or swimming the channel\". No lie. As a result I haveÂ  a breast full of painful adhesions. Now I hear that rads make them worse. Right now, I feel like being done with them all-2 surgeries have left a bit of breast w/a nipple, I had stage 1,grade 1, invasive lobular-2cm, with clean margins BOTH times, no nodes, e+p+ her-. According to my \"team\" I needed the works-chemo included. Then he tells me they advise chemo for all breast cancers from stage 1 on. Does quality of life even matter anymore? I'm so discouraged, and I feel like a big baby listening to all the brave women who had radiation w/o a second thought, and accept the awful side effects with equanimity. Does anyone out there feel like I do? Thanks for the chance to vent!",

My RO would not have suggested it but I did alot of homework and felt this was best. More per day(2.65gys) but less overall (42.5gys instead of 50gys & a boost). Done in 16 days. The studies 12 years out all say as good or sometimes better for cosmetic results, and as good at prevention. I knew I couldn't handle 61/2 weeks-I would have cut and run at the first sign of anything bad. 3 weeks I can be brave for. Please ladies, at least bring this up. They are doing them according to new guidelines, but ARE NOT OFFERING THEM unless the patient asks. ALOT less side effects during treatment. God bless and good luck to all of us! BTW, I'm stage 2A lobular invasive, er+pr+her-, no nodes,clean margins TWICE, and post menapausal.",

First,you need emotional and spiritual support-it will sustain you. Employers are a little tricky. We have a business, so my 'employers\" are our customers. The rule I followed was to tell customers who might be affected by my cancer,i.e. deliveries delayed or calls not immediately returned. If you don't honestly think that your diagnosis will effect your interactions with employers/customers, I think it's safer for your job to withhold the info from them. If you do say something, I would keep the tone as light as possible and refrain from long explanations. They aren't there to support you-you are there to support them. Your friends and loved ones are there to support you-lean away! Anyway,I'm glad I did it that way now that I'm done. Blessings and a hug. You'll do fine-you sound strong.",
