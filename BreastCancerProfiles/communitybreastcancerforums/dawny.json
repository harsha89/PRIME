I was ER/PR- HER2+. I had Abraxane and Herceptin that took me to NED. Then a new lump in same breast and lymph nodes in chest again. I had Kadcycla on a clinical trial, had progression in lump, came off the trial. I decided to have a single mx, and radiation to the chest wall. Pathology from mx showed receptor change to triple neg. I wrongly assumed that if I was going on a HER2 clinical trial, that receptors had been checked. I was very peeved that I had gone through six months of Kadcycla hell, without a chance of it possibly helping at all. The good news now is that I am now NED again, for almost two years. I decided against reconstruction, as I didn't want the possibility of further complications either. I can't understand how your onc can say no to receptors changing. How can that be known without testing? I hope you get some clarity, has surgery been scheduled for you? x",

After the mastectomy, pathology showed it had morphed to triple negative. I was diagnosed nearly 3 1/2 years ago, only on Herceptin now, sticking with that in case it morphs back to HER2 positive  😀  I hope this gives you some encouragement, I am doing really well, hopefully your mother will also.  Xxx",

Twelve months later, another lump in same breast, so had lumpectomy and started a clinical trial for TDM-1. More progression whilst on the trial, so left the trial and had a single mastectomy, which showed triple neg. My oncologist believes I had both triple neg and HER2+ at diagnosis. I then had rads on the large node in the centre of my sternum. so for over three years now, I have been NED. I am having scans on Friday (six monthly now!) hopefully NED will still be with me.

I have had both, and I think they were for nausea.  I know you would check that before using, sometimes I don't trust the old memory!  Nausea is just awful, one of the worst things that comes along with cancer, in my opinion.  I hope you can get it worked out soon, life seems much brighter when you are not nauseous.  Best wishes to you Dawn.  xx",
