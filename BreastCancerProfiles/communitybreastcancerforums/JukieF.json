I'm thinking about getting a tattoo after I finish healing. I have two incisions very close together (from two different lumpectomies) and now a tatt right next to them. I think it might be kind of cool to get a tattoo that incorporates all three things. Kind of a celebration of my victory over cancer. :-) I'll worry about that later, though... ",

I think the standard is six weeks post-op, but I was leaving for a month and a half and I barely had time to get the six weeks of rads done before I left. As it is, I'll have my last treatment the day before I leave! The surgeon's main concern was that my incision was healed well enough to tolerate radiation, and I'm a good healer, so I got the go-ahead. It would have been nice if I could have waited longer, but this is working out OK.",

He told me that because of my breast size (I'm fairly large breasted) I wasn't a good candidate for it. He was so funny. He's a little Chinese man (from China), and he was trying to find a way to explain it to me. Here's the best he could come up with: It's like the difference between cooking a large roast and cooking a small one. LOL Apparently, the higher levels of radiation required to get through all my breast tissue in the accelerated treatment would be much harder on me. He didn't recommend it. I'm doing the six weeks.",

I couldn't change my trip plans, and we had to hustle to get my rads done in time. You can't plan BC! :-) I know it's going to be a long couple of days because I have to take the take the shuttle to the first airport. I have a direct flight to London, then a three-hour layover in London before my flight to Madrid. Travel is tiring under the best circumstances, but I'm going to do my best to rest as much as I can. One of my concerns was having some big dude sit on my bad side and elbow me for nine hours. British Airways doesn't let you reserve seats ahead of time unless you're a preferred customer, but I called the airline and explained my situation, and I now have reserved seats on all three of my BA flights. I'll have window seats, with no one on my bad side and will have the side of the airplane to lean my head on and rest. They were very accommodating. But it required a phone call, because when I made the request via email they said no. Also, if I'm as tired as I think I'll be (given how I feel now), I won't hesitate to ask for a wheelchair if I have long walks between terminals.  The good thing about my trip is that I'm going to be in Spain for a month, and I'm staying with a friend. I plan to rest the first few days and give myself a chance to recover. Good luck with your trip! ",
