Please checknthis website cancerfree-areyousure.com and RCG lab in Greece website, that can explain more. When you have a 2mm tumor you already have ctcs or microtumors in your blood, that is why this staging system is obsolete. Most of us are stage 4 at diagnosis, when a tumor cant be seen in a scan yet. Very sad.",
