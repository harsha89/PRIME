I came to this site for the same reasons as Healthy _future. And his experience is almost exactly like mine. I had always been able to fix things before and this I could not fix. Please be patient with your husband and give him a chance. I realize that you like my wife Are the ones that are dealing with this disease. But to see our partners go through this is emotionally devastating for us. I picked up the book they are referring to At our hospitals cancer support center during 1 of my wife's treatments. See if he will read it it will help or see if he will come to the site. It has helped me to understand and come to grips with what's ahead For me and my wife.",
