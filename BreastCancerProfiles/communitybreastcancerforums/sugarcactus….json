I went to my first breast cancer Meetup last night and one woman joined a chemo group on this sight over a year ago & they are all meeting up, 2 years post. How cool is that? I am trying the Paxman (and am taking heating pad). I wonder how easy to pee when I\u2019m hooked up to everything? And with TC, it\u2019s so important? Like, can I just do my infusion in the bathroom (haha). I am going to get some Biotene mouth wash. That was a tip from the group. I am also trying the finger and toe packs, my oncologist said it will help with preserving nails and neuropathy. I\u2019ll try to post a picture of the gloves. My place in Seattlehas them for use, luckily. But it will be cold! He also advised me to try Glutamine and B 6 supplements. It may help with neuropathy Loved the idea about working with your chemo & asking your cancer to go. Although I have my angry days, I feel better with just making peace with it.    ",
