Is anyone else breaking out?",

Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to post about their experiences. I am sure your posts have helped many.  Congratulations to those who have finished or will finish chemo soon. My last chemo (#6 TCHP) is tomorrow. This has been one heck of a ride. I am extremely nervous about tomorrows treatment. I am already exhausted and do not look forward to the dark days that lie ahead. At least I know the dark doesn't last forever. Praying for you all and wishing you all the brightest of futures.  ",
