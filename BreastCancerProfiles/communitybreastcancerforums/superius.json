So far I had 1 session of TC (3 more rounds). & of course, there will be Hormonal Therapy afterward.",

I had been asked by multiple people (including Doctors) if I have thought about it (I haven't). When people talk about balance, are they talking about posture or just look? What I read about Recon (just basic information) is pretty scary - multiple surgeries, many months... If it's just for appearance, I am pretty ok with the camisoles I got from after surgery. I also got couple sport bras with removable pads, which I doubled up, that's it, barely notice the difference (I don't I'm even a B) If it's about posture. What are the concerns? I haven't found information about that...",
