I really like him and now feel more comfortable with my decision to go with TCH rather than AC-TH. I will start tx on April 12. I do have a question though after reading some of the posts. What is a Neulasta shot? This wasn't brought up in either of my consultations. Is this pretty standard for anyone getting TCH? Thanks ahead of time for any feedback.",

My WBC was only at 240 and my MO orginaly said he wanted it at 500 before discharging me but I begged and pleaded with him this morning and he finally gave in. So I'M GOING HOME! I know it was only four days but I was starting to get depressed. I mean the entire time I was here was like a constant reminder that I have cancer. At least at home Im distracted and can live a semi normal life. And Im just not use to sitting around all day. I'm a mom of two young girls, ages 4 and 2. So they keep me very busy. And I'm just not good at \"taking it easy.\" Plus we don't have cable at home and Im not a fan of daytime tv. So I was going stir crazy here. Anyway I can't wait to go home hug my girls, take a long shower and wash my hair....oh that was another thing Im 12 days post my first treatment and haven't lost an hair yet, so the entire time I'm in the hospital, I'm praying my hair doesn't start to fall out until I get home lol. Anyway, enough about me. All of you beautiful ladies getting chemo this week will be in my thoughts and prayers. Have a good Wednesday everyone!",

He said I can go ahead and try it but he doesn't have any information on it.",

The first MO is having me decided between two treatment options: AC x4 and THx 4 or TCHx6. His words to me were \"Both treatments are just as effective but AC is more agressive. I personally would go with AC and TH but it is a personal decision that you have to make.\" To top it off the Oncologist Case Manager that I was suppose to meet with before my treatment started is on vacation and won't be back until April 15, so instead of getting an in depth explaination on what to expect on the first day of treatment I got a nice short email that said to dress warm, eat a good breakfast, and bring snacks since the chemo room does not provide food. Nice! Hopefully I will get more information from the second MO and he can shed more light on the differences between the two treatments. Otherwise I feel like I'm pulling at straws here. Anyway can't way to meet more of you ladies so we can compare notes and support eachother.Â ",
