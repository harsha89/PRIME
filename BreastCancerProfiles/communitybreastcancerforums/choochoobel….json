      "Content": "Sep 27, 2015 02:46AM - edited Sep 27, 2015 04:22AM by choochoobella I always \"run hot.\" Even on cold nights, I usually don't like more than a sheet over me. When I wore mastectomy bras and inserted prosthetics, I was miserable during the warmer months. I would end up with a heat rash on my chest. Just a few months ago, I found these lightweight little bras that American Eagle sells that are 98% cotton. Since they are targeted to young girls, they have built-in padding that creates a nice little A cup for me. I'm happy to just have an indication of a bump even though my breasts used to be a C-cup. I barely perspire with these things on. They have softer elastic too, so they don't press on my scars. I paid $19.99 for each and bought nine of them. They're all I wear anymore. If it's a particularly scalding day, I put a little talcum powder on my chest before I put the bra on. This has been an awesome solution for me. I looked up the name of the bra on my order form and it is \"Aerie Cotton Push-up Bralette.\" If you type this in quotes on Google and hit images, the first couple of images are of the bra I got. Wouldn't you know it though? It has now sold out. I don't know if they will be making this bra again. I hope so because my prosthetics have been in the drawer ever since I got these bras.",
