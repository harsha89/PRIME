IDC, ER+/PR+,HER-, Grade 2 and Stage 1. After reading over what you all wrote for the third time, I just realized it may not stay that stage after the nodes are looked at. My doctor said I could have a mastectomy with reconstructive surgery or lumpectomy with radiation. I asked for a genetic blood test because of my mother having breast cancer at 29, her sister with ovarian at 40 and her brother with pancreatic at 60. (My brother with prostate cancer at 45.) I had that test today and it will take 7-10 days for results. I think if I am positive for the gene mutations, I will have a double mastectomy and hysterectomy. Ugh I hope it doesn't make a difference if I delay on this. If genetic mutations are negative, I guess I would go with lumpectomy and radiation.",

I had one on Oct 31st, last possible date for October, yet I thought lumpectomies were so much more common. I think it makes some sense in that people having the more drastic mastectomy surgery would be more apt to reach out to others undergoing similar treatments. ",

On Wednesday night my primary care doctor called me and told me I have breast cancer. She referred me to a surgeon who will see me tomorrow. I was not too worried about the biopsy because I knew I had an 80% chance of having it come back negative. So I am shocked and scared. I don't know what stage I am and I can't find (on internet resources) how much the biopsy can reveal. Will it tell if I have cancer in lymph nodes? I would assume no if I have not had a lymph node biopsy ...so that means if it is some stage of 1 or 2 I would have to wait to find out if it had spread and it can't be fully 'staged'? Sorry, this is confusing. My primary doctor talked about possiblity of radiation and chemotherapy but I was not well informed enough at the time to ask more questions.  Well, I guess I will find out a lot more tomorrow.  Ginny Dx 9/13/2011, IDC, Left, <1cm, Grade 2, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I have my husband coming with me today and I can record what the doctor says so I can refer back to it later. I will ask for a copy of the pathology report. My hope is that stage will be 0 and nonaggressive. My mother died of breast cancer when I was 3. She was 29. But that was a long time ago.",
