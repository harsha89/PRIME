I don't think that a stool softener is something you need to do prior, but that said, have you ever had any surgeries before or had to take painkillers? If so that might help you to decide... Britishlass- funny, I was just noticing today that a freckle and some stretch marks I have are now in different places, a little weird, but reminded me of this whole thing - a little rearranged, but still the same person! On a funnier note, I decided I was feeling good enough to put on a regular sports bra this am (one that you slip on, no fasteners) well, I got stuck halfway thru the procedure and had to holler at my daughter to go get my hub out of the garage because I needed help, he came running up the stairs so fast I think he thought I was bleeding out... When he saw me tangled in the bra he just started laughing... So much for dignity! : )",

Luckily I have been seeing a psychologist thoughout this whole process and she and my gp recognised it for what it was right away, I decided to take some low dose antidepressants and it seems to be helping a little.  But what a shocker.  Honestly, I never thought that I would be someone that would experience this...  Isn't it amzing that many of us that are experiencing these symptoms are on a similar timeline... I've got to wonder if it might also be a little seasonal, with the weather turning dimmer and grayer it brings out the worst in our psyche. Stay strong ladies, keep walking in the sunshine and taking joy where you can - I'll be thinking of all of you when I lift my face to the sun... OM12",

Days 2 & 3 after surgery were ok, but about day 5 the achiness set in, drains (2 in same spot) were pulled Monday, Tuesday was agony, swelling, some fluid, etc. but here I am on Friday 9 days later, feeling ok, can even sleep slightly sideways and am down to only 3 Tramadol a day. Now I'm just waiting for path report. The sleep deprivation is killer for everyone, but just think for us August girls by the time the leaves turn and we have to put on heavier coats, we'll all be able to move our arms! : ).

Anyhow, the fact that she called at 4:30 on a Friday to give me this news restores my faith in all good things. It's been a hell of a trip, and I am so bloody thankful to be shed of it all. Now I just hope this implant settles into place, the swelling continues to go down and someday soon I'll be able to sleep on anything other than by back!!! To all the August ladies still on the road, stay strong - I'll keep checking in from time to time, and feel free to PM me as I have an alert to my mail for that, but I am going to take this bookmark off my toolbar, I need to close this chapter and move on. A million thanks to you all for sharing the tears, trials and now triumphs as we journey through this, it makes me so grateful that we have this technology to connect to each other.

But it is so uncomfortable, and makes me not want to move my arm at all (which is impossible because I'm right handed), plus then I freak myself out if I don't move my arm because I think i'll get frozen shoulder or something awful.

For those getting drains out, I'm relatively thin and it didn't exactly hurt me, just felt really creepy - kind of like an emery board was being dragged along a back rib...

I also still have deep pain around my implant, docs have said same thing - major surgery, you need to stretch but it takes time to heal, your body has been thru trauma...

My hub and yours sound similar, he's been suggesting some rather interesting nip tattoos, and considers himself quite the comedian (winking eye and smiley face are his two top choices!) Not! For those still struggling with Bras - sears sells an excellent front zip sports bra by vogue, I found the band a little too tight at first, but just snipped some triangles in the elastic and it was great, super easy to get into. So went for my mtg with bs yesterday, path results still not in... Ugh. It's been almost 3 weeks. Good news is the bs said she would be very surprised if I needed chemo, and a friend of mine who's a GP said that was a positive as most docs will not offer any conjecture if they think there's a chance for the negative. I was quite the spectacle at the clinic, They took all the steristrips off, so I'm completely free now. I guess they don't get too many direct to implants so several nurses and a resident came in to have a look (they asked and i said sure) and the bs took photos, they all seemed very pleased with the outcome... Personally I think the foob looks a little flat, I thought it would be more rounded, but apparently there is still shifting. Tazzy - it's amazing isn't it, days ago we were barely able to focus on breathing, now I actually have many moments in the day where breast cancer is not the first thing on my mind.

Justine - glad to hear your SEs are mild, and I hope that continues for you.  I've got contracture around my implant too and the pain is centered around my lower under armpit area (where they took nodes as well), if that makes sense.  My physio & massage therapist say that it's also due to hunching over computer and too much mouse work.. muscles in my mid back and shoulders are tightening which is causing other muscles to pull in as well... she recommended that I try to lie on my back on the bed or couch and let my arm dangle off the edge while rolling my arm outwards (think of doing a snow angel and then turn your palms up).  Apparently it's not unusual to have pain caused from nerve regeneration at this point as well...  I can only imagine what the fatigue must be like dealing with this AND the treatment... I'm wiped just dealing with the pain & day to day life.  Hope the semester ends well and the pain subsides. All the best ladies! OM12",
