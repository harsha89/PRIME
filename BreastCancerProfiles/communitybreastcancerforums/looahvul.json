There are SO many women who will pay for curlz (ie; chemical perms) and NOT that many that will go through a chemical straightener.  In other words... if we could only trade with you!!!!  =^)  BTW, I use a SEDU 1\" flat iron from www.folica.com.... best straightenin AND curling iron I've ever had!  I have a niece with curly hair that comes in any time she is home from college to have me straighten it.... =^(",

I've been a hairdresser for 37 years... what I have learned over the years is that without chemo, hair will grow on the average of 1/2 inch per month. Some people have faster growth, some slower.  It will grow faster in mild temps; ie; fall and spring and you have fall \"fallout\" in moderately cool temperatures.  Each hair strand will last 3 -5 years before falling out and replacing itself.  So if your hair grows 1/2 per month and last 3 years, it will not grow as long as someone whose hair grows 1/2 a month and lasts 5 years.  All of your hair does not grow at the same rate, if it did, it would all fall out at once and replace itself at once.  Most chemo hair will start growing in kinda patchy, grey & dark and curly.  Most chemo hair will eventually be nearly like it was before losing it, but it takes about a year after it starts growing to get your texture and color back.  Some will have more body, some less, some will retain some of the curl, some will not.  If you did not have curl to begin with, you will probably have straight hair again eventually.  When you first start getting your color back, it will usually look a bit faded.  If I think of anything else or if you have further questions that I can be of help with, I'll let you know.  kudos to us all... donna ",

Most of the time it won't stay curly, but I am hoping I'll get a chance to try the curlz out too when mine starts coming back.  I've always said that if curly haired people could trade with us straight haired people, they would never get their curlz back... and they would want them!  =^)",
