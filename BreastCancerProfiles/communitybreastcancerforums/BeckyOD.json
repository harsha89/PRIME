I've been on gemzar, Xeloda, navelbine, taxol, and Abraxane. We revisited the Taxotere/carb in there again. It had been a miracle combo for me but then it stopped working. Nothing else has been more helpful than slowing the progression and containing the lesions to the liver and spine. I'm surprised your onc didn't do a full round on navelbine. Doxil has helped a friend of mine a lot. So hopefully it will for you as well. Yes, you are in quite a battle. Big hug.",

So I did the only thing I could think of: take a treatment off and go to NY with my DH. As my reward, I guess, my onc decided to add carboplatin to treatment yesterday. Within an hour I was very chilled and violently throwing up. Then my temperature spiked to close to 102. They sent over a nurse with meds so I'm much better today in that \"I've-just-had-chemo way\". Has anyone had this combo and, if so, did you have a bad reaction? One other woman at my center also had a bad reaction a couple of weeks ago.

He sees my weakening state and he has no direction to send me. I see him hurting almost as much as me when he can't help me. That being said, I must say that when I come in for an appointment feeling pretty good and am personally feeling optimistic the appt goes very different, more upbeat and I can get a lot of answers and info that point in a positive direction. I'm not sure it's fear you may be getting from your doctor or helplessness. Some procedures and treatments can really cause us more harm than you and I could truly understand without a medical degree. Trust that this is hard for your medical team too.

Every so often I ask for a couple weeks off to get a little stronger. Not sure it's that wise but I need the time off. It seems that once a drug \"fails\" the cancer has gotten a little worse. The new round of drugs is to try to get me back to where I was before the last one failed. Rarely has that worked out and I learn to accept my new \"norm\" for maintenance - but it's still being controlled and I'm thankful for that. After a recent progression I'll be starting my 6th different protocol on Tues. I asked my onc about using AIs again. He felt they hadn't been that useful to me but it couldn't hurt to ask your onc. What a road we're on. Becky",

My last posting was so dark and needy I feel it's time to say goodbye to that with thanks to all of you for helping me through it. My edema is slowly but perceptibly going away. Other things are also clearing up. The progression is another thing but at the moment I have very short term plans that don't include thinking about it. Once I can walk without danger of falling and can bend my knees to drive by myself I am off to little local adventures around town, which can be numerous in L.A. So welcome Spring. We all need you.

Been thru enough changes along the road to know that each new change in diagnosis changes everything. Not only do you have to come to terms with this personally but so do your friends. You have to accept things, they don't. Your real friends will come around when they've accepted their own fear of what's happening to you. Not everyone can do this so let them go. Time to join support groups and any new activities you can. At least you won\u2019t be so lonely. Support comes from the oddest places sometimes, keep an open mind. In the meantime, hang tough.

Pain and nausea seem for me to be the best help, often times insomnia. It does not help my anxieties over this disease. All that said, I find the fogginess of the chemo to be a deterrent to want to use pot very often and become more spaced. So I'm a partial fan. I never smoke it. I have a vaporizer and sometimes use the homeopathy style drops. Eating it is fine but there's always way too much sugar in the product and you can use too much very easily. I don't broadcast this use to anyone. It's a private decision. If the last 7 years had been a party and not constant chemos I'd be singing a different tune for its use -- but pot's benefits are definitely there for pain and chemo relief.",
