Each clear Pet/Ct regarding the tumor is nothing short of a miracle to me!     Meima",

I hate that answer.  I'm a yes or no person.  Said we could re scan 4-6 months and see if any change or if pain increases.  He said answer not black or white more like a grey area.  Any advice?   Thanks for any input.     Meima Dx 8/31/2006, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

(I know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it).  I was fine until end of 5th. week then got SEVERE bone pain from hip, femor area (where I have rod), right down to my feet.  It was so bad, Onc. said go to ER for xrays.  She was worried about fracture.  Xrays were fine, but still unbearable pain.  Was told to rest, take pain med., ibuprophen,rest, etc..  This was all on Friday. I did as told and got some relief.  Monday I had my Zometa infusion, and by Tues. morning, no pain at all!  Can it be that it is so critical to stay on every 4 week schedule?? or is this just some crazy coincidence???  Meima Dx 8/31/2006, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I was also on blood thinners like Fitzwins, shots to the stomach.  I'm so glad they got to this before the femor neck broke.  You will be in my thoughts and prayers monday.  Wishing you a speedy recovery.  Please check in when you are feeling up to it.

(Arimidex, Femara, Tamoxifen, Aromasin).  I have very little quality of life.  I feel a bit guilty for complaining since the cancer is still in my bones; very extensive, but no organ involvement yet. I rarely leave the house since I can't take a walk, or stand in one place for more than a couple of minutes. (My husband will take me out in the wheelchair if I really want to get to get out).  The pain, numbness, buzzing pain is continuous and worse at night, so sleeping is sporatic.  I have tried nsaids with minimal success.  Pain meds made me sick and constipated.  Currently trying Tramadol and switching back to Vicodan.  Not much help.  I am seriously considering asking my Onc. to put me on Chemo. (I was on CMF at original bc diagnosis, and it was actually easier to tolerate than the AI's., although it was only for 6 mos. and not long term like this \"easier\" treatment).  I am not a complainer, but I am so lost right now, any advice would be welcome. Sorry for the long post, and thanks for listening.    Bev Dx 8/31/2006, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
