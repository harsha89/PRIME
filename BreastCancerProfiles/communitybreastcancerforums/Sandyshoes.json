Things that have helped have been avoidance of salt and I am drinking fluids as if the sink might stop running tonight! So we were in surgery the same day... I plan on being home at least 4 weeks before I attempt returning to work. I have learned that once you're back there's no \"light duty\" in my job! I sure hope you feel better soon. I meet with p/s tomorrow AM. He did place \"larger than me\" implants in (my request). I went from a B cup to a C+ or so. Haven't truly been bra fitted yet- it's too soon. It was quite tight for the first couple days but feels more natural now as the swelling recedes. I still have difficulty looking at myself in a mirror; I feel strangely detached just now, not ready to check myself out. I have inner wounds to battle. Honestly the very worst was the dull headache I had from dehydration and exhaustion. That took 4 days to pass. Fortunately it is behind me. Let me know how you are doing, sister warrior.",

      "Content": "Jan 14, 2013 05:47PM - edited Jan 14, 2013 05:54PM by Sandyshoes Jennifer- Hello and all the best to you as you face your surgery and recovery. I had a BMX with immediate reconstruction direct implants last Wednesday, 1/9/2013. I'm 49 and am now home recovering and am glad to share a bit of my prep/recovery story in hopes it eases your mind a bit. I meticulously researched this topic because I wanted to plan for what I could so I had less unknown to deal with. It's emotional enough without feeling unprepared. Glean what you can; it's all very fresh in my mind right now! Support Network First, I am married and my hubby is tremendously supportive; he always attended all my doc appointments and I know I am very lucky to have him with me. I am also surrounded by well-wishing friends and neighbors who have been parading food through our kitchen non-stop since I came home Thursday afternoon. Do not be shy about telling people how they can best help you. Food, childcare, a brief visit when you are ready, a favorite DVD move, whatever you feel will help you. What to Pack On the day of my surgery I brought the following with me to the hospital: Things I personally found no use for- magazines (too nauseous and out of it to read), mints (smells and tastes really grossed me out), extra clothes. I wore yoga pants and a button front cotton cardigan one size too big for me. The looseness accommodated my drains and my bandages and my swollen self nicely. Recovery Day 1 First day out of surgery I was pretty out of it and on morphine. They brought me a breathing trainer that you sip on like a straw to exercise your lungs and to make you cough out any accumulated fluid. You build your lung strength back up and I was glad my nurses forced me to do this. I dozed in and out of vital sign checks and generally wished I was someplace quieter than a hospital. I had zero appetite. Nausea meds were my friends. I did feel as if a very tight band was strapped around my chest. Recovery Day 2- Pain and Drain Management 101 Next day my doc said they would release me if I would eat something and be able to tolerate a pain pill, so I forced down hospital eggs and pears and dutifully took my pill. All good so I was processed. The nursing staff showed us how to empty my drains, take measurements and record them. I had been anxious about them, so allow me to reassure you that this aspect is NO BIGGIE. I have been able to empty them myself, although hubby takes great pride in helping. They are pretty easy. One thing to have on hand at home to ease the drain issue when you want to shower: a long shoestring. Hang it around your neck with the ends on your chest. Slide an end through the tab of each drain then tie the shoestring ends together behind your head (you will need assistance for this). This will keep the drains from hanging/tugging when you are in the shower. For everyday drain placement, my plastic surgeon just popped one into each bra cup over the bandage and there they remain until it is time to drain the fluid. I like this plan- no extra garments to buy and it kept the tubing away from my pant openings so I never mistakenly yanked them down. My BFF the Recliner The day I came home I settled into my recliner, and this was the one change I made in our home that has really paid off in spades. If you do not have a comfortable recliner already, see if you can borrow one. The angle of the seat and back make a huge difference in your recovery comfort. You cannot sleep on your sides (and of course not on your tummy) so having something that cuddles you like a recliner is a huge help. I did not have one so I put out a request on Facebook to see if any friends had one I could borrow for a month or so. I was offered about 20. People really want to help, I have found. I can comfortably sleep. The first night home I did not have the physical strength to get from reclining to sitting to \"up\" on my own, so having someone home that night was a godsend. By the way, I have not needed a pain pill since I came home, only my antibiotics. I am thankful for this. I hate pain pills and all their associated side effects. If you do need them, pop a stool softener at the same time. Moving Around My doc advised me to move around as much as I was comfortable with- she reminded me she was not operating on my legs and that walking would improve bloodflow and ease recovery, as long as I listened to my body and did not overdo things. Things I have done on my own but still lightly struggle with: showering (clean hair feels good), using the ladies room and wiping (you can do it but reaching is not the easiest task on the to do list), reading (I am 5 days home now and today is the first day I felt remotely like reading.) I know everyone heals differently, but I attribute my relatively easy recovery (so far) to being in good physical condition before surgery (I walk every day of my life and eat healthfully) and to preparing on the front end. Not worrying about cooking or trying to plan meals for a well-meaning but poor-planning hubby has been a relief in and of itself. I have a few more weeks at home before I can return to work. I am not anywhere close to driving. I have the emotional side of healing ahead of me. I still fear the drain removal process but as is noted everywhere on this forum I am not going to miss those babies. Gosh they're a blessing and a curse! I hope this information helps you. Each day is better than the day before as you heal. Sometimes you feel like you took two steps forward and one step back. It's still progress and you're well on your way to risk mitigation and a healthier future. I will keep you in my prayers on the 17th! Linda",

Thought I would let you know that this was something I had not even dared hope for but had secretly dreaded because I thought it would be painful.  It was not in the least painful but the sites (I had 2) did sting for about 45 minutes afterwards. It's been three hours now and I am feeling so much more free and comfortable. Small victories. I have also graduated from a huge ace bandage to a compression band that will stay in place for a couple more weeks. Still sleeping in the recliner; being flat on my back = painful. I still tire easily but  smile more. Wishing all my January Warrior Sisters a calm journey.",
