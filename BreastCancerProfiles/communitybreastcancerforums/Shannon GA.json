Don't get me wrong, I'm happy that they didn't find anything, but on the other hand I'm worried that the lump can be felt and nothing showing up.  It's not a cyst, swollen node, nothing?  It just seems odd to me.  I've sent a message to my primary doctor to see what she thinks of his opinion.  I'm just curious if anyone else has heard of this.  Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jul 20, 2009 01:59PM - edited Jul 20, 2009 02:58PM by Shannon-GA Hi AusMum, congrats on your outcome! Update:  I received a copy of my mammogram/ultrasound report from my doctor:  Diagnostic Bilateral Mammogram: Routine views as well as exaggerated craniocaudal views of the breasts are obtained.  This is the patient's baseline examination.  There is no family history of breast cancer.  A marker is placed at the site of the palpable abnormality in the axillary right breast.  The breast contains heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue thereby limiting sensitivity of the study.  There is a vague focus of glandular density in the axillary region of the right breast corresponding to the palpable abnormality and additional spot compression MLO projection was also obtained demonstrating the glandular density.  No nodularity was noted and additional evaluation with ultrasound was performed. Right Breast Ultrasound: Transverse and longitudinal images of the right axillary region in the area of the palpable abnormality was performed.  There is no underlying cystic or solid nodules. Impression: Probable asymmetric glandular density in the axillary right breast corresponding to the palpable abnormality.  As there are no prior mammograms available for comparison, a 6 month followup of the right breast is recommended.  ACR Category 3. This study was R2 read (computer-aided detection device). Information regarding mammography: Dense breast tissue, such as adenosis, fibrocystic changes, etc., may obscure an underlying problem/neoplasm.  Approximately 10% of cancers are not detected with mammography.  A negative mammography report should not delay biopsy if a clinically suspicious mass is present. Results: BIRAD: 3 - Probably Benign Finding(s)  Follow Up: 6 months. So, from what I read, it basically states what the radiologist told me, which is he thinks it is breast tissue, which would be great if I couldn't feel a specific round hard lump that does not feel anything like the surrounding tissue and still has me worried.  I had to look up \"heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue\" to get an idea of what he was referring to, and I guess it's just really dense breast tissue.  In my searching on the internet, I came across sites that had research that seems to indicate that women with denser breast tissue are at a higher risk of developing breast cancer.  Has anyone else seen this or heard anything about this?  I should probably stop looking up things on the internet, it has me paranoid now, but at the same time it's been very eye opening....it's made me realize how much I didn't know about breast cancer, or the breasts in general.",

Also, I wanted to mention, and this is really just for information in case anyone new is going through this as well, but my doctor said that the reason the lump wasn't showing up on the u/s was because the node is located just beside my muscle and when I lay back, the node is covered by the muscle and breast tissue, which would also explain why it's hard to feel it when I lay down.  He asked me if I was laying down when the u/s was done and I was.  I told him that I had explained to the u/s tech when she was doing the test that it was hard to feel when I was laying back, but I guess she didn't think it would make a difference.  The doctor said she should have had me sit up.  This is why he has not recommended an MRI, he felt that it most likely wouldn't show up on the MRI as well. He also felt that a needle biopsy wouldn't get enough of a sample, and may actually miss something, and I would end up doing an excision anyway, so he didn't want me to have to go through 2 procedures.  Same reasoning for not doing the core needle biopsy, but with that he also was concerned about the fact that they basically \"shoot\" the needle into the lump and since the node is so close to the muscle, ribs and lungs, he wasn't comfortable with doing that procedure.  This is why he wants to go straight to the excision if it comes to that.  Hopefully it won't come to that and maybe it will just go away.",
