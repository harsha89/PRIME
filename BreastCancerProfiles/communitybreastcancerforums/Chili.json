( mind you,  i don't blame him too much for that part, as i was hacking like crazy all night, but it was a bit lonely)..   however,  when the breast cancer diagnosis came in, he really came through and was totally there for me.  Good to know you can count on him in a pinch.",

It is nice to join the group.     Today is pamper day.., my dd got me a gift certificate for a massage at xmas, that I finally went for this morning.. it was lovely. I could use that more often for the sore, stiff muscles.      this aft i'm going for my first haircut post chemo.  not that she has a lot to work with,  it's only about 4 to 5 cm , but i'm hoping she can at least shape it up a little  so i can do the spiky thing.  bring on the hair paste!    I did not know about the eyelashes and eyebrows falling out again,... that caught me by surprise... good thing for eyeliner.   Dec and January were tough as I had what finally got diagnosed as costocondritus.. or inflamation of the cartilage in the chest, which was very painful, and i couldn't do much of anything or it would flare up again.  Good excuse to get the kids and hubby to carry the laundry baskets and grocery bags though.   I figure  it was side effect from rads.  But  after taking it really easy for a couple months and 5 weeks of arthrotec (anti-inflammatory) it seems to be mostly better. It is very nice to be able to get active again and feel somewhat normal.   Heck i might even be able to handle a bra again soon..  I couldn't stand anything the least bit constricting around my ribs,  Sure cuts down the wardrobe options for work, good thing for long scarves and loose tops.  The rad onc said the sore breast tissue from rads should be gone in a couple months.  something to look forward to.    Still waiting for the appt for my first post-treatment mammo and ultrasound which is supposed to be in march sometime.  And of course waiting for biopsy results.... working on convincing myself  to go with the bigger odds, that it's nothing. ( but then,  my lump was supposed to be just a cyst )      hope you all have a nice weekend. ",
