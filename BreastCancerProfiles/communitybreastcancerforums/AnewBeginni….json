We have to hang in there because the chemo is BIGGER than the beast and we will all get through this. I have to say my 3 rounds were much easier than I expected and Im hoping #4 will be the same. My MO told me my next tx of THP will even be better with no nausea and Im looking forward to that because the nausea is the worst thing for me making it hard for me to hydrate because liquids make the nausea worse for me. I've tried every drink on the shelf and just find one worse than the other and also because my tastebuds are not working good. Uggggg! I was even able to drive myself yesterday and that was great was very tired that night but woke up next morning feeling feeling great and full of energy and spent the day doing yardwork. My sister who is in from California does not drive in NYC but the company was great. She will be leaving next tuesday and I must say I will miss her terrible as she has been so supportive.and great company. My next tx plan is THP but will be weekly.

Started out with seeing MO first at 10a then for blood which showed my platelets to be 79 and was told they could not do chemo unless it was 101. Ok so they had me sit and about 1 hr later they said they were going to redo the bloodwork. They did and now it came back being 101 and they would now do the chemo. I didnt know much about platelets but I didnt think it was something that could change so rapidly so and I wanted to be sure my platelets were up so I asked for copies of both tests. They explained that the first test may have had clumped platelets together. So my chemo didnt start until 4pm and lasted 3 hours. The access to my port was easy and the tx went smooth. So far s/e are just about a little tired or weak and a bit of shortness of breath but nothing to complain about. No nausea to speak of but am taking the compazine. Appetite is good so far. I got to take my Neulasta shot Thursday and am taking Claritin ...so far no pain but I dont know when that would start if ever. So far Im ok and I hope to stay this way..........fingers crossed here.

Going for #11 today then 1 more to go. My original MO's plan was after Taxol it would be Herceptin and Perjeta every 3 weeks for 39 weeks which comes to 13 Perjeta. I changed my hospital and now have a new MO and her plan is to give me only 6 Perjeta saying there is no data that Perjeta has any benefit beyond the 6. Should I be concerned? Any and all feedback appreciated.",
