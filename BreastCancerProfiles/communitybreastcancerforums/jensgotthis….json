My addition, as someone new to a stage 4 diagnosis, is that your panic and despair is totally normal. I too am a single mom to a 6 year old son and my initial days were spent in a downward spiral. Then I did my research and followed some people here and see that my life is not over today. While my expiration meter is likely shorter than I ever thought it might be, no one is guaranteedtomorrow and I'm learning to enjoy today and still make plans for the future. I also started Effexor (common antidepressant for people on Tamoxafin) and that has helped to stem some of the day to day anxiety. I was diagnosed with mets to the bones during my initial BC diagnosis in Dec and just a few months later I have a better handle on things more of the time. I'm still scared but I'm trying to focus that into doing everything I can to become one of the 10+ year MBC patients. Sending hug",

I'm exhausted but I love that my body is feeling stronger. It gives me a great mental boost. Now if I can just get my mind focused on work and get rid of this nasty fatigue. This is week 3 of my resolve to exercise because it does so much good for me, and I'm happy to say that I swam for 35 minutes. And even better, I sat in the parking lot for a good 10 minutes debating whether I wanted to go in and go through the hassle of changing, etc....AND I GOT OUT OF THE CAR! yippee",

It sure would be helpful if there was something more definitive. As to the other part of your post, all I can share is the motto I now live: \"Do not put your happiness on hold.\" And it's a motto I now tell everyone who asks \"how do you do it\", meaning living with this dx. Really, there's never a perfect time for anything, or enough money, etc... So, don't wait. I was dx MBC de novo at 41 (almost 42). I'd just recently separated from my husband and had a 5 year old at home. Despite some really rough days, I can honestly say that I'm happier now than any other time during my adult years. I definitely worry, but I know I'd rather have 5 years of happy living with MBC, than 15 years feeling terrible. That said, I do try to get through some things on my bucket list while I still feel very good, because the realist in me knows that days will come when I no longer can do it. I've spent some time trying to think through/plan out/plan for how I will work, as I had been working F/T since dx and was becoming overwhelmed by fatigue. So, I took the next step of partial disability, and will take the step after that when my guts tells me to. I plan for travel in advance (because I love it so much and it really gives me something to look forward to) and I'm currently saving up to spend a few weeks abroad next fall. Circling back to what you were really asking - I recall there is a chart that gives some stats for longer term survival once you reach 3 years, then 5 years, etc...it basically shows that your chances for living longer go up as the number of years you have MBC increase. Maybe someone here has that chart handy? I've poked around and can't come across yet. ",

I'm a bit worried about your Oncs rush to rads. I totally understand if you are having significant pain that the rads can help. But, I know I find it helpful to have the whole picture before jumping in. I know a series of tests was recommended earlier (PET, tumor markers, liver function, etc...). I totally agree those are very important to do. Also, what about a biopsy of the new tumors so that you can know whether the receptor types have changed. That's critical for long-term therapy. And is rads enough, does their need to be surgery to stabilize your spine? I also want to join the encouragers. Bone mets can be treated for a long time, and the early treatments are pretty tolerable for most. I'm in this now a little of 2 years with mets to my hip bone and have had a great response to treatment so far. My story is very common. Come on over to the bone mets thread and you'll find some folks who have had mets to spine and I'm sure they can offer some good experience. Big hugs!",

The two I've seen are small studies and disagree with eachother. I was dx with a single bone met and my MO who is the head of oncology at a top ranked NCI designated hospital told me he was going for curative intent and was going to swing for the fences (his words not mine). That matches my personality and logically it made sense to me to reduce the tumor load (I had a complete response to chemo). So I had a unilateral mx, rads to breast, and rads to the bone site. I've opted for no recon as there's some evidence it can accelerate the disease. I'm a single mom of an 8 year old boy and can feel the agony of your decision making progress. Google oligometastatic if you haven't already. None of us (including our docs) know which is the best choice. My advice to you is to make the choice you feel best about and can live with, no matter what the outcome will be. My last thought is the surgery and rads really were not that bad physically and I've worked full time through them. The pain isn't bad for me but the fatigue is rough (and likely further complicated by the Ibrance and Letrozole combo I'm on combined with the joys of life, work and motherhood) Good luck! There are lots of options out there for us. Hugs",

I don't get home from work/picking him up from aftercare until 6:30 or 7. I've had to be okay with slacking off of chores a bit but feel okay with it as I know they'll still get done. To make the actual transition, what I have found helpful is to listen to an audio book for about ten min once I'm ready for sleep. I have a few things I use once my eyes are closed that range from a relaxation exercise (my toes are heavy and warm etc) or if my mind is spinning I do (really) long division problem in my head. On the rare nights I don't fall asleep quickly, then I read in bed. I have a kindle and use the nightshade setting and sometimes I'll fall asleep mid sentence.

The only other thought I can offer is to see another doctor to get a second opinion on your status and further options, including whether a treatment break is a potential option. If you are interested in continuing treatment Inwonder too whether a new biopsy might help to see if receptor status has changed again for you. Good luck, only you knows what's right for you.
