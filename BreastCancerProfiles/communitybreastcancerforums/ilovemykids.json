By day 18 it was itching and more would come out...I was ready to shave it, but instead, just let what was going to come out, do so.  I am happy with this choice, as I can wear a hat and still have my bangs and all else that I do have.  H& M has cute ones!  To each his own and all choices about our hair is fine.  This is temporary!  We can do this, and you know what, we will have richer lives, with more empathy, understanding, wisdom, and  courage because of this roadblock.  Hats off to you!  No puns intended.  YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!",
