I have it in my arm and hand.  Here is a link to tell what is covered in Ontario....i'm not sure about therapy but i know the sleeves and gloves are.

Also you should put extra padding in your sleeve if you have one? Did she teach you how to wrap and are you doing this at night? You may need a second opinion. Also with hardness the MLD is different. I had hardness(fibrosis) and by putting extra padding im sleeve and at night wrapping it took it away. Did you see the instruction on wrapping here? le hugs jinky",

She doesn't think the enzymes are that important And stressed the ultrasound was all good. She really thinks it is do with something I am taking. Remember all the vitamins which started up my esophagus. It's getting better. Since my last liver test which was pretty good, I have used a lot of gaviscon for my Barrett's esophagus. She doesn't want to rule out cancer in my liver so I am going to have a cat scan and see her in a month and have new blood tests. On femara she wants to talk to me about that at my next appointment.(April 1st) I imagine if my enzymes are still up she may stop femara but she said they are not high enough to stop femara. She said if 100 women had my kind of BC about 70% Wouldn't have their cancer come back and with femara it would be 77%. I will ask her again next time. I feel at least I am getting checked out and I am still thinking it is femara . Thanks for listening.

What i did was include my thumb and the base of the thumb....went around and around it. I did it firmly. I also put komplex on the back of my hand as i usually do but i also made a slit in a piece and put over my thumb. Well this morning is the first time it has all (le)disappeared. I can't believe it. I am on to something i think. We have been blaming the swelling at the base of my thumb on inflammation from severe arthritis in that joint. Maybe it is le?

      "Content": "jinky wrote: Staging and severity Whether primary or secondary, lymphedema develops in a number of stages, from mild to severe: Stage 0 (latent): The lymphatic vessels have sustained some damage which is not yet apparent. Transport capacity is still sufficient for the amount of lymph being removed. Lymphedema is not present. Stage 1 (spontaneously reversible): Tissue is still at the \"pitting\" stage -- when pressed by the fingertips, the affected area indents and holds the indentation. Usually upon waking in the morning, the limb or affected area is normal or almost normal in size. Stage 2 (spontaneously irreversible): The tissue now has a spongy consistency and is \"non pitting\" -- when pressed by the fingertips, the tissue bounces back without any indentation. Fibrosis found in Stage 2 Lymphedema marks the beginning of the hardening of the limbs and increasing size. Stage 3 (lymphostatic elephantiasis): At this stage, the swelling is irreversible and usually the limb(s) or affected area is very large. The tissue is hard (fibrotic) and unresponsive; some patients consider undergoing reconstructive surgery called \"debulking\". This remains controversial, however, since the risks may outweigh the benefits, and the further damage done to the lymphatic system may in fact make the lymphedema worse. Lymphedema can also be categorized by its severity (usually referenced to a healthy extremity): Grade 1 (mild edema): Lymphedema involves the distal parts such as a forearm and hand or a lower leg and foot. The difference in circumference is less than 4 centimeters, and other tissue changes are not yet present. Grade 2 (moderate edema): Lymphedema involves an entire limb or corresponding quadrant of the trunk. Difference in circumference is more than 4 but less than 6 centimeters. Tissue changes, such as pitting, are apparent. The patient may experience erysipelas. Grade 3a (severe edema): Lymphedema is present in one limb and its associated trunk quadrant. The difference in circumference is greater than 6 centimeters. Significant skin alterations, such as cornification or keratosis, cysts and/or fistulae, are present. Additionally the patient may experience repeated attacks of erysipelas. Grade 3b (massive edema): The same symptoms as Stage 3a except that two or more extremities are affected. Grade 4 (gigantic edema): Also known as elephantiasis. In this stage of lymphedema, the affected extremities are huge due to almost complete blockage of the lymph channels. Elephantiasis may also affect the head and face. age 2, grade 1, 4 chemo, 5 yrs tamoxifen, femara 48mts, preventative mastectomy 2005 Dx 4/30/2002, ILC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

This is what you all have taught me so i am not scared like i was when i first came here. It is working and that is what counts. Binn thanks for the summer hints...didn't realize the sun would bother my arm. This is what happened as i went yard sailng with just my sleeve and no long sleeve shirt. I know better now. It seems when i USE my hand and arm it swells and when i take it EASY it is good. Is this normal???????? I am being careful with hangnails and bites.

These can often cause severe stiffness, even destruction and rupture of the tendon. These present acutely with stiffness of the finger in a slightly bent posture, diffuse swelling and redness of the finger, tenderness on the palm side of the finger, and severe aggravation of pain with attempts to straighten the finger (see Figure 4). This infection requires immediate surgical drainage of the tendon sheath and antibiotics. In diabetics this condition can occasionally lead to the loss of the infected finger. I certainly don't have this thank God. le hugs jinky",

I have had only 2 flare ups....enough already One xmas 2007 when i MASHED the potatoes (unbelievable) and the other when i forgot i was not 21 again and scrubbed the floor on my hands and knees (never again) using my non le arm to scrub and LEANING on my le arm which really blew it up( the lower part of my arm went twice the size it was and i couldn't believe the skin would stretch so far) and it was gross and i almost freaked out. The good news is now my arm is pretty good. Won't be down to where it was before, but only up a couple inches in places. Maybe it will still get better withh my wrapping every night. I am happy with it as it is soft again. Anyhow i just want you all to know this does happen.....i thought (really wrong) my le was going to stay the way it was before the flare ups. So you never know what will do it but the wonderful thing is we are together trying to get through all the ups and downs. le hugs Carol age 2, grade 1, 4 chemo, 5 yrs tamoxifen, femara 48mts, preventative mastectomy 2005 Dx 4/30/2002, ILC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I know I am not having surgery or cortisone when I see the plastic surgeon. Waiting for a 24 hours call if someone cancels or next Spring. It is too much of a risk for me. Also I have no pain and I can grip with it.....just can't pick up tiny things. I notice femara can cause trigger fingers and I have 11months and 21 days to go. Maybe it is a combination of cellulitis and femara. I got what was suppose to be a custom sleeve and glove from mediven. They sent me a glove at $250 and a sleeve and glove attached for $350. It felt so good and for a day my hand was good. The next day my hand swelled a lot as i need padding in my glove to keep my swelling down. Trying different things but they all mess up when i put it on. Wrapping untill it gets down again.Thinking I may have to just use it as a glove. I did cut a old sleeve and it stayed good but i will have to see. Have a lot to be thankful for....Happy Thanksgiving everyone. bc hugs jinky age 2, grade 1, 4 chemo, 5 yrs tamoxifen, femara 48mts, preventative mastectomy 2005 Dx 4/30/2002, ILC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It is also used to treat cold sores, and to treat and prevent recurrences of genital herpes. It works by interfering with the way the virus reproduces. Maybe the bubbles are from my sleeve?

      "Content": "Dec 14, 2007 06:47PM jinky wrote: According to a study published in the Annals of Surgery, breast cancer patients who develop lymphedema after removal of axillary lymph nodes may benefit from having lymph nodes transplanted from the groin to the axilla. Though sentinel lymph node biopsy (removal of only one or a few lymph nodes) is increasingly being used in the staging of early breast cancer, many women have undergone the more extensive removal of axillary (under the arm) lymph nodes; this procedure is known as axillary lymph node dissection. Side effects of axillary lymph node dissection may include pain, infection, limited shoulder motion, numbness, and lymphedema (swelling of the arm due to an accumulation of lymph fluid). In an attempt to improve lymphedema in women who have undergone axillarly lymph node dissection for breast cancer, researchers in France evaluated the effect of lymph node transplantation. In this process, lymph nodes are removed from the groin and transplanted into the axilla. The researchers have used this procedure for 12 years. They have reported on outcomes in 24 breast cancer patients. The patients had all undergone mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, and most had also received radiation therapy. All had lymphedema that was resistant to physical therapy. Patients were followed for an average of 8 years after lymph node transplantation. After the lymph node transplantation surgery, patients received manual drainage (a type of massage that helps move fluid out of the arm) daily for the first three months and then twice a week for the next three months. The researchers conclude that lymph node transplantation appears to be a safe and effective treatment for lymphedema. Outcomes may be best for women who undergo lymph node transplantation earlier in the course of their lymphedema. Reference:Becker C, Assouad J, Riquet M et al. Postmastectomy Lymphedema: Long-Term Results Following Microsurgical Lymph Node Transplantation. Annals of Surgery. 2006;243:313-315.
