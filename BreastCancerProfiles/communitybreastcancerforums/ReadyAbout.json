I feel much, much better on Cymbalta - still residual sensitivity, but nothing like it was before.",

My PS advised that I do bilateral since my breasts had quite a bit of droop (thank, kids!) and it would have been too hard to match the foob with the remaining breast. Also, both the BS and the PS mentioned my relatively young age (49) as a reason to perhaps consider bilateral mastectomy. I had many complications after surgery, some minor, one major, and yet I would STILL do it all over again. I think if I had left the healthy breast on, I would be waiting for the other shoe to drop. I am a very healthy person with a track record of rare health issues, so I didn't trust the healthy breast to behave. Good luck with your decision and outcome!",

I am STILL waiting on Oncotype/HER2 because the tumor was misdiagnosed as DCIS and pathologists at Oncotype lab discovered it was invasive.

She tested negative for a breast cancer gene, but the geneticist said that she probably has a gene that simply has not been linked to breast cancer yet. The speed at which research is shaking up genes & cancer is staggering. I have an ATM VUS gene mutation and the VUS simply means that they don't know enough to classify it one way or the other yet. And I agree, having even a zygote of a plan does wonders for one's feeling of control and optimism! Here's hoping your lumpectomy goes well!",

The PS also wrote a prescription for steroids to subdue the swelling and tame Limey, my pet hematoma. Finally, the tissue on my left breast/nipple was not healing very well and there was a chance that if enough tissue became necrotic, I would need surgery to clean it out. Someone on the reconstruction forum told me about hyperbaric oxygen therapy. My PS had never had a patient do it, but he wrote a prescription and my insurance approved it (<----biggest surprise since being diagnosed) and I started two days ago. I can already see a difference and even my PS was impressed when he saw me today. I go for two hours every day, first thing in the morning. It will help the tissue heal faster and better and prepare me for future surgeries. (TE exchange, fat grafting, etc.)",

I think my nerve pain is improving as I took half the doses of Percocet today and felt ok. I am sad that I tried to wean myself off the pain meds last week when I was in such bad shape. My friends sent me some socks that said \"I am strong\" on the top and I looked at them one morning and burst into tears because \"strong\" was the last thing I felt. I guess I'll know for the next surgery, lol. I did a long hike with one of my kids today and had the best time - she is in college and will leave soon for Peru for the rest of the summer and I was so excited to have one-on-one time with her. I start PT tomorrow for the axillary webbing in one arm and I'm eager to get that ironed out as it is tough to straighten/use that arm. I finally called the MO to get my Oncotype score (long story) and it's 19. I was hoping to skip Tamoxifen but I have a feeling he will lobby in favor of it. I am sorry to hear about people having pain/issues with fills - I agree that it is so hard to be in pain and need the drugs but at the same time worry that you will become addicted or be perceived by your doctor as at risk of addiction. I will get my first fill one month post-op because I had issues with the tissue healing; I'm a little nervous about how the nerve pain will be but baby steps... I hope everyone continues down the path of healing and optimism. GO TEAM!",

He couldn't do the fill because he FORGOT to tell me to take antibiotics beforehand. Even worse, he tried to say that I must have forgotten amidst the \"overload\" of information I've received lately. (I am super Type A when it comes to details, so no, I did not \"forget\".) He still refused to prescribe anything for the nerve pain, saying that he didn't know where I got the \"myth\" that gabapentin is a good medication - he said all it would do is make me high. The crowning glory of the appointment (other than him running an hour late) is that I pointed out 4-5 surgical threads still hanging out of my skin in various places and asked if those have a function in the future. They don't - I guess he just didn't notice them when he was tidying up after surgery. He snipped them off and I hope he was embarrassed by this oversight. I am waiting anxiously for the shipment of marijuana edibles from my cousin in Colorado to see if it helps with the nerve pain. Worst of all, because of this delay with the fills, I don't think I can do the exchange before I have to report back to school in August. He said the exchange would probably involve a lift with fat graft, and to recover I would need to take a week and a half off from school, so I will probably wait until fall break in October or Thanksgiving, so 5-6 months with tissue expanders. UGH! (insert muffled scream here) Sorry for this litany of complaints - maybe I'll post happy ones after the edibles arrive, LOL.",

Maybe it's a placebo effect, but either way, it has helped with the nerve pain. I'm seeing the pain specialist tomorrow and will report back if I get any good advice. My nerve pain definitely improved after 3 weeks, but man, those 3 weeks were r-o-u-g-h. I think I have maybe had 6 days since surgery where I haven't cried at some point in the day, and I am not a crier. Also, I was allergic to the foam padding they put all around me after surgery and I took Benadryl for it- it was awful trying to get under the foam to scratch and when they finally took it off after a week, there were a few big blisters that had popped. At the very least, the Benadryl will help you sleep. I'm sorry you are going through all this! Michi: I definitely feel more pain in the morning. It's like a little thought bubble with \"WTH?!\" pops up above my head when I sit up in bed. I take an Aleve, make some coffee, and then sit still for 30 minutes while I wait for the Aleve to kick in. I also wake up every night with some pain but I usually just ignore it. I am 5 weeks out and have tried to run a little bit but each time I do, there's a painful tugging sensation on the lower outside corner of each breast, apparently from the sutures that hold my expanders in place. In the meantime, I've done spin, elliptical, hikes, treadmill walks, etc. I did 5 lb bicep curls yesterday, then briefly wondered why my left bicep was sore today, lol. My PS gave me the ok today to start lifting light weights, but my tissue expanders are on top, not under, the chest muscle and that may be why I can start.",

I think I will need grafting and a lift but my PS and I agreed to do it later, like at Thanksgiving or Christmas, so I don't miss more school. He likes to do grafting after the exchange anyway. My college roommate texted me today to see if I would talk to her cousin who has BC. She is only 32 and is having bmx, 20 weeks of chemo, and radiation - I think the cancer is stage 2 or 3.

It didn't make sense to me to meddle with the good side, and I hated the idea of getting implant surgery just as I'm getting over the infection. At the last minute I told him I wanted the TE removed on my bad side and then sewn up and left alone to heal on its own.

I estimate that 25% of my mental desktop is continuously running a file called \"Upcoming Mastectomy\" and there's no \"Command Z\" shortcut to undo it. Because of all the pink ribbons, cheery slogans and cute balloons, some people assume breast cancer is an easy road, and it's not. I'm guilty of assuming it was no big deal since the survival rates are so high, then I got cancer. If you are doing reconstruction, you may want to see if you're a candidate for prepectoral reconstruction and find out which plastic surgeons in your area do it. The implants go OVER, not under the chest muscle, so there's a much quicker recovery time. There is a board dedicated to this topic: \"TE/Implant Over the pectoral\". At the top of that board is a lengthy list of PS in each region of the U.S. who do prepectoral. Hope this helps!",

My PS either reads this board or felt bad about how he treated me on Friday because he called yesterday and is going to refer me to a pain specialist. While I am grateful that he came to his senses, I just can't imagine that I'm his first patient to have these issues. My pain is improving bit by bit, but regardless, I want to meet with the pain doctor since I have at least one more surgery in the future and I may have a similar reaction. Also, my cording is SO much better - I can straighten my arm all the way and the cords in the armpit are getting looser. The PT has been awesome to work with. kandyhunt: ZERO Oncotype?! WOW! That is fantastic - I've never heard of someone coming in at a zero. For once, it's good to have the lowest score on a test! My score is a 19 and when I meet with the MO in a few weeks, I'm sure he'll have a big ole bottle of Tamo waiting for me, lol. sn75 & blessed: the sunburn feeling/sensitivity is nerve pain - it's what I've been moaning about for the past month. There are 4-6 nerves on each side of the breast that are cut during a bmx and they sometimes react angrily to surgery. A few things I have found that help (besides drugs, since my PS wouldn't give me any): Penetrex cream (Amazon) - I slather it on 3-4 times a day and rub it in well. I think rubbing it on my skin, although painful, has helped desensitize the painful areas. Shower: putting the shower head on a strong setting and letting it hit the sensitive areas also desensitizes the skin. Caveat: I could even think about doing either of those things the first week or two of nerve pain, but now that I'm in week 4, it's tolerable. I also spent a considerable part of the first two weeks just walking around the house topless- fortunately, I have daughters. A friend who had nerve pain with her bmx said that she kept wanting to invent an inverse cone like dogs wear after surgery - one that would go around your neck and lift the shirt away from the skin - I have thought about that a gazillion times since! Bras: for those of you wondering about which bras to wear after surgery, there is a thread about this: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/44/topics... Several people have recommended Coobie bras to me, and they seem to be comfy, but right now I'm more comfortable in zip up athletic bras from Athleta. Naked and Eberjay are also brands that have been recommended. ",

Did anyone else have cording? Tight cords go from my armpit to below my elbow and I can't straighten my arm or reach for things without significant pain. I did one session of PT last week and one of the cords popped and while it was a little unpleasant, it was nice to have that release. I'm still having nerve pain/hypersensitivity but doctor wouldn't prescribe nerve pain medicine. I have been taking a half dose of Percocet when I wake up and then Advil the rest of the day, but I'm on the verge of tears by late afternoon and I'm not a crier. Wearing no shirt/bra provides instant relief but I can only do that around the house. (: I will see the PS on Friday and if I'm still having the nerve pain, we are going to have a little \"Come to Jesus\" talk.",

I think part of it is due to waking up a gazillion times during the night and part is recovering from the surgery. I just started a muscle relaxant at night due to a hamstring injury and even that isn't helping me sleep well. I'm usually tapped out by 9:00- I went to an outdoor concert the other night with my husband and by 9:30, all I could think about was lying down and going to sleep in the grass, which to my credit, I didn't. I turn 50 tomorrow and for my birthday, my PCP scheduled a colonoscopy, so I have that to look forward to in a few weeks. I told a friend that one of the hardest things about this stage of the recovery is wondering when I will enjoy things and look forward to things like I used to. I feel like a subdued version of myself. A friend who has gone through this reminded me that all of us in the May group are currently in the intermediate stage of recovery, which is the hardest stage. It will get better even if it feels like that day is distant.",

Based on my Oncotype, I have a 20% chance of recurrence somewhere else in the body later; taking Tamoxifen for 5 years will lower the odds to 12%, which still sounds kind of crappy odds to me, but the MO said that 95% of his patients with the same profile take the Tamoxifen. Has anyone else started Tamo yet? My PS cleared me to resume lifting weights so I'm back in the gym doing slightly lower weights with more reps. I still have some cording, which makes some things difficult, but overall I feel more confident using my arms in all kinds of weights. Do the stretches and arm exercises, friends! They will really help you regain range of motion quickly! Happy 4th, friends!",

The pain from the SNB injections was not too bad. They numbed the area up with lidocaine and I felt 20 seconds of stinging with each shot and then felt fine. The hardest part was getting up to use the bathroom several hours after I awoke from surgery- I was super wobbly/dizzy and my husband and a nurse had to help. I felt like I was going to throw up but then I felt great as soon as I got back into bed. And... to add insult to injury, my period showed up for surprise visit so the nurse had to help me with deal with that as well - whatever they are paying her, it's not enough. Nodes were clear (wahooo!) and the BS and PS said everything went well. The most helpful thing so far has been a post mastectomy sweatshirt that a friend bought for me on etsy. It has large pockets sewn on the inside to hold the drains and it's lightweight so I can wear it all the time. Here is a link for it. Post mastectomy hoodie Good luck everyone - you've got this!",

She said that if they happened to find cancer in my \"good\" breast after it was removed, it would be good to have already done SNB on that side and have the pathology. At first I said ok, but then I read about what SNB entails and possible side effects, and I changed my mind. I am SO GLAD I did not consent to doing SNB on the good side! The pathology on the good side came out clean and I was spared the discomfort of SNB on both sides. I could tell that the surgeon thought it would be better to do SNB on both sides, but I was resolute in my decision and this time, it paid off.",

I talked to a few BC survivor friends about how to do this because I tried to shave in the shower and then would check later and it looked like nothing had been shaved. They said to look in a mirror while I'm doing it - that due to swelling/TEs/implants, the angle will always be kind of weird. All 3 of them said they still have to use a mirror to shave. Also, there are two different Oncotype tests for BC: one is for DCIS and one is for invasive. They both have very different scoring ranges so you definitely want to be sure you've got the right test range for your score. Also, FWIW, I was ambivalent about doing reconstruction and I might have very well been tempted to skip it if my husband didn't have an opinion. He would have supported me if I had not done reconstruction, but he said that if I was okay with it, he would prefer that I go for it. I am not sizing up or anything, so clearly he won't be ogling a new, supersized set. I pointed out to him that if 1 out of every 8 men got testicular cancer and had to get their testicles removed but could opt to leave the skin and meanwhile choose the the new shape and size of their fake testicles, and oh by the way, there will be no sensation or functional purpose to them now, very few would make that transition. My husband gets a chest cold and acts like he's in the last stages of tuberculosis. {...rolls eyes...}",

She slowly listed several different medications and the side effect of each, and then we agreed on a plan. For those of you with nerve pain, there are several drugs that are effective for treating it and it just depends on your situation/pain. My doctor and I decided on Cymbalta, which happens to be an antidepressant also used for treating nerve pain in diabetic patients. It won't make me sleepy or groggy, I can drive on it, it's not considered a narcotic/opioid, and it's kind of a 2-for-1, as it will treat any situational depression I may have in slogging through cancer treatment. She also prescribed a topical ibuprofen gel called Voltaren; it is used for joint pain but can be effective for nerve pain as well. I'll slather that on several times a day and also keep up with the Penetrex cream I've been using. She also mentioned taking Cymbalta ahead of my next surgery to minimize potential nerve pain afterwards. Finally, she said that although opioids get a bad rap because of the addiction issues that are always in the press, they are precisely the drug people need to take after major surgery. She said no other medication will touch the post-surgery pain as effectively as narcotics like Percocet, especially after you've been \"flayed open in a mastectomy\". It was just nice to hear a doctor acknowledge what a ruthless surgery this is. Hope this helps! It sounds like many of us are dealing with some challenges at precisely the point we expected to be getting back into the routine of our previous lives. I really feel for those of you with little ones at home! I don't know how I would managed this back when mine were that age; my younger one is a whirlwind of energy and was always swinging from the rafters on a good day.",

You'd think that we would at least get a pass when it comes to post-surgery complications, but I guess not. This may not be a popular opinion, but I decided after I was diagnosed to seek out female healthcare providers. Whether it's a fair assessment or not, I feel like women listen better and are less likely to finish my sentences or chalk me up as an uppity patient. Since then, I've found a female PCP, orthopedist, PT, etc. and I've been so pleased with my experience each time. Also, my mother was a physician recruiter for a large medical clinic and she once told me that when push comes to shove, a PA is often a better listener than an MD, so my PCP is a PA and so is my pain specialist. My only truly bad experience this entire time has been with my PS, which unfortunately, is a big piece of the puzzle. I hope the pieces fall into place for you, and sooner than later. {hugs}",

My right foob has kind of caved in and my husband is convinced the saline is leaking. I just think the expanders have sunk down into the tissue.

If it doesn't heal 100% when I'm done with antibiotics, I'll have to get the expander taken out and he'll put in an \"antibiotic plate\" and a new expander ON BOTH SIDES. Ugh. Fingers crossed and prayers lifted it doesn't come to that. Also, only having one arm as a viable option for blood draws and IV tubes is really hard! My right arm was a pin cushion by the time I left. On a bright note, friends took time to visit with me while I was in the hospital so I had a steady stream of people to talk to and had some great conversations. I was mildly concerned about keeping up my streak of drinking one different craft beer every night this summer, so one of my friends snuck in a cold IPA for me. Good times!  ",

I did not have SNB done at the time, so that may be painful post-surgery. I went back to work a couple of days after the surgery. I did have some discomfort the following week, mainly I noticed that when walking briskly, the incision site was kind of painful and I kept holding my arm against my side to keep the breast still. As for your kids, I think teens are often a lot more resilient than we give them credit for. My kids (19 & 16) got very worried when they realized we were keeping something health-related from them, but when we told them what was going on, they did fine. I think because I was very matter-of-fact and upbeat, they responded accordingly. (Or maybe I have done a superb job of raising them to not be emotionally attached to me, lol.)

My PS never mentioned this and 2 of my drains have been less than 15ml for the past 6 days and the other one has been under 30 for 3-4 days now. My PS has been on vacation the past week so I wouldn't have gotten them out earlier, but I wonder if timing matters at all. In any case, it has been a pain (literally) to keep these things in longer than necessary. I will see him on Wednesday and hopefully get more than a \"drive by\" appointment - he hasn't been very attentive in appointments, even by my relaxed standards.",

Stay on the schedule for pain meds and have them by your nightstand so you don't even need to get up from the bed to take them during the night. Week 2, the things I still need help with: Driving - I am not supposed to drive until I am off pain meds, and although I only take them when I wake up and when I go to bed, I don't want to drive because SNB has left my arm very tight and unreliable at the moment. Since I'm not driving, I bought a subscription for a grocery delivery service called Shipt and that has been great. Bathing: I can't shower until my drains are out so I am doing the best I can but I can't reach my back. I have to enlist a family member to help but you could totally skip that. Dressing: go with button front tops and elastic waist pants (sweatpants) in case you have trouble dressing. I bought several large button downs at Goodwill and have lived in them and large hoodies the past two weeks. The skin at incisions sites and on the SNB arm is extremely sensitive and I just want to wear soft things. That's about it. I am 49 and an avid runner so I thought I would weather all this better than the average person and I was wrong. I don't think I stayed on top of the pain meds and when the pain hit, it was staggering. Things distinctly improved exactly one week after surgery. I have walked the neighborhood, gone hiking, and done the recumbent bike at the Y, all at probably half speed, but just doing something active has been a balm for the soul. Finally, don't be reluctant to reach out to people - they want to help, they just aren't sure how. When I was first diagnosed someone pulled me aside and said, \"When you let people help, you are blessing them.\" We don't get any bonus points or gold stars for navigating this on our own - ask for help when you need it and someone will be delighted you did. Good luck with your recovery - you've got this!",

I am still going to take a Percocet first thing in the morning for several more days because everything hurts. I\u2019m waking up most nights at 2 or 3 and taking Advil.

When my tissue wasn't healing, I had to visit a wound doctor while doing the hyperbaric sessions. She ended up ordering a special dressing called a Sorbact gel dressing - it was a mesh strip designed for infected wounds. Here is a link for it.

The most common side effects I hear about are joint pain and weight gain. (Why can't side effects ever be clear skin and weight loss??) I had bad nausea the first few days on Cymbalta - I almost stopped taking it after the first day because the side effects were so bad. I stuck with it and feel totally fine on it now.

Anyway, I had read about it on different forums and many, many runners said the injection pain was unimaginable and they would never do it again. The doctor and nurses had a tough time finding a vein on me that was big and wouldn't roll and they stuck me at least 15 times in my right arm, wrist, hand, etc., finally getting enough blood from the veins on my feet. They kept apologizing and I was like, \"This is NOTHING compared to mastectomy surgery.\" Then when the doctor did the big injection, I didn't realize it was over, because again, NOTHING will ever compare to mastectomy surgery.
