I spoke to my doctor about it and she has said that the lump is movable and slippery. She has referred me to a breast clinic to get checked out and although she has reassured me that she thinks it could be benign what has bothered me more lately is that my breast has now ballooned in size and feels like it's burning. My doctor has said I am not eligible to be fast-tracked to a more urgent appointment. So now I have to wait on this letter - which I hope will come soon as I am getting worried about how big my breast has gotten. So now I don't know what to do. Can anyone advise? I don't want my doctors to perceive me as someone who's making a fuss as when I saw her about this the first time she seemed to be fed up with me seeing her. Jo x Log in to post a reply",
