By two weeks post I had a bit of peeling skin but that was it, and I was back in my regular bras. Now one month off rads and the radiation zone is slightly pink. When my skin was really bad it would hard to believe it would ever get better! Believe me ladies, it will, and wasn't starts healing it's amazing how quickly the healing is.  in the meantime I had flamazine ( I think that's the same as Silvadene) but what I used more than anything was the Polysporin with pain relief, I believe in the states it's called Neosporin. It helped to prevent infection and helped with the pain. I used it liberally and the broken spots, every where else I used a variety of different moisturizers, I don't really think that one was better than the other! Whoever did not have a Mesec to me, my nipple got very very bad, white and huge. It looked like an infection but the white was actually blistering skin, I confirmed that with the radiation oncologist yesterday. I kept it covered in Polysporin and then put a non-adhesive gauze pad over it, I didn't need tape or anything because my bra held in place, really the Polysporin hold it in place.",

Not about tomorrow specifically because I've heard it will be very quick and noneventful, just in general about getting side effects. Grazy I am six weeks pass chemo now, I do have hair on my head but it is very sparse, so you can see my scalp through it. It's actually quite ugly! I like how I looked more bold but I have to let it keep growing or else I will never have hair again. For those moving onto tamoxifen, I started 2 weeks ago. It hasn't been too bad. I noticed for about a week that I had a hard time waking up, my husband noticed that my alarm was waking me whereas in the past I always woke before it, even through chemo! Around the middle of last week I started waking up more easily again. The first few days I also noticed that I would get very tired and foggy a few times a day, they would be spells that would come and go lasting maybe half an hour or so. They seem to have gone away. I am a bit more tired and less energy than I was pre-cancer, but I don't know if that was from the tamoxifen, the chemotherapy, the time of year because I never feel awesome in the spring or what. I would say in general the tamoxifen has not been horrible at all.",

I agree my shoes do not work well with the shorts, I felt pretty awkward walking around in yoga shorts, a hospital gown, and heels! Honestly, even if I am wearing a short skirt, you cannot see it below the hospital down so it didn't really make a difference. I've only worn dresses a couple times, but I like having the option. Yes it's interesting how they all give different advice. I was told to start using the lotion in advance, to prepare my skin. I actually use my strive for every day anyway, so it wasn't really much of a change for me, I just switched to unscented lubriderm (I use that at home and have glaxol base in my purse for after treatment, RO recommended either of them. I was realizing today that through all of this, I haven't seen anybody in a waiting room or treatment room my age. I know young women like me get cancer obviously, but we are still the minority even if it doesn't always seem like it. I was feeling quite old before I got diagnosed, but these days I'm feeling pretty young! Today a young woman in the waiting room smiled at me and I felt a bit of kinship with her, then her father came over.",

I'm having 25 sessions, instead of doing boost afterwards the boosts are during my normal sessions, it's called simultaneous boost. I can tell when they are doing them because the buzzing is twice there. Iasked why I am doing 25 instead of the typical 20 in Canada, I was told it's because of the lymph node involvement. My breast size has never been brought up with regards to this, however I am quite large! I had number two today, 23 to go, no problem so far but I know it is still early.",

It is large and spacious, with Wi-Fi, knitting basket where people are working on scarves for charity, and there's a cafeteria attached so I can get a snack or drink if I want, although I don't always have time to eat it! I usually get there about half hour early (because I give myself an hour to get there, in case I run into trouble with traffic or parking, usually I don't but it's a busy hospital in a busy area so I like to be sure), and often they take me in early. If not they usually get in on time. Once or twice they've taken me in late but usually they don't. Once they call me I go to a waiting area outside the radiation units, where there is a change rooms. The gowns are in the change room, they are fabric I put one that opens in the back, and then another one that opens in the front. I don't bother tying either of them. Then I wait outside the change rooms, usually it's a very short wait before they call me into the unit. They confirm my date of birth and my appointment for the next day. Then the outside down comes often gets laid on the bed, and I lay on it they take my right arm out of the sleeve of the other one, to expose my breast for the marketing and measuring. I do not have a belt although I did have the option, so I just lay still while they check my measurements, and then leave the room while I get the treatment. Right before the treatment starts she always calls out my name, my birthday, and the words \"no bolus no belt\" and the other tech confirms. I am always in the same unit, there are 12 units and like somebody else mentioned there is a monitor in the waiting room that says which ones are delayed. If get there and see my unit is delayed, I usually go for a little walk. I always have the same techs. There are four in my unit, as well as two students that are often there, so most days I have to have the techs, and sometimes a student as well.  ",

Even though I finished chemo four months ago, mine started growing back when I did tatatore which was 5 1/2 months ago, so it's been a bit longer! i've been using shampoo with collagen by Marc Anthony, but I don't know if it helps or not because I haven't not used it",
