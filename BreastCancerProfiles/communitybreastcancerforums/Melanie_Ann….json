However, I noticed after chemo that I can't taste olives so my mom puts them on pizza when she makes it. I know my taste is back when I can taste an olive. Black Bean Pineapple Enchiladas Ingredients: 1 red bell pepper 1/2 medium white or yellow onion: chopped 1 tabelspoon olive oil 1 15 oz can of black beans; drained 1 20 oz can of crushed pineapple in pineapple juice 1 rotisserie chicken Cilantro (optional) 1 cup Mexican shredded cheese 1 large can of enchilada sauce 10 to 12 medium-size multigrain flour tortillas Directions: Dice the red bell pepper and onion and saute in olive oil over medium heat or until tender. Add drained black beans and pineapple including juice into the skillet. Stir and heat. Pull apart white meat chicken and shred. Add chicken to the skillet and cook till hot.  Two, 9x13 glass or casserole dishes. Lay one tortilla in the dish and scoop approximately 1/2 cup filling into tortilla filling center end to end. Tuck 2 edges of the tortilla over and roll the untucked side completely enclosing the filling. Place seam-side down in dish. Stuff and roll the rest of the tortillas the same way until dish is full. Pour the enchilada sauce over the top and sprinkle cheese on top. Bake at 350 degrees for 15 minutes until bubbly hot. -I got this recipe out of a book. This is the original recipe. I didn't have a rotisserie chicken because I don't live where I could get one. So I baked some chicken breasts and used those. It was a little labor intensive recipe but only because I made it that way. I'm sure the rotisserie chicken would save time. I also didn't used the canned enchilada sauce. I made my own. I'm not really sure I liked the kind I made so next time I think I might find a natural canned sauce or omit it alltogether. I think they would have been just as good without the sauce. Als, this made a lot! I think I actually got about 17 enchiladas out of it. Definitely way too much for 3 people. So we're having leftovers! It was a really good/different type of Mexican. The filling is a little sweet due to the Pineapple so it's not a typical mexican flavor.  - I got a short walk in yesterday. My arm has reallllly been hurting. I have that axillary web syndrome and it's so painful. It flairs up at the oddest of times. I missed my PT appointment this week due to having tests run for chest pain. SO, hopefully next week she'll be able to help me. I did do as many exercises/stretches for my arm as I could and it does feel better today. I can't wait until I have it healed so I can start some resistance training with my arms again.  Wow my post is already huge so I'm going to stop there! I hope everyone has a healthy and productive day. This thread keeps me motivated! ",

I worked 12 hours today...I'm surprised I'm still awake... I got in a walk yesterday but probably won't today seeing as it's almost 11 pm and I really feel like going to bed. =) My arm is still swollen. It's so depressing. I'm normally the most positive person but this is really getting to me. It really doesn't look that bad but just the thought of it ever getting worse, plus all the literature that I read says no golf, which I love, no lifting more than 10 lbs, what about kids? I love to pick them up and cuddle them! No hot showers...ugh, those are so relaxing. No repetitive movement, no sunburn, no scratches, no no nonono....I'm sick of reading that stuff...I know, I should just stop. But I'm the girl that pushed for preventive education, which I had just 12 days before the good old are decided to swell. Now the lymphedema specialist actually told me, no exercise....for now. I feel fat. haha...ok I know I sound totally pathetic. I feel like I've been asked 5000 times in the past few days...what happened to your arm? Then, when I tell them, they proceed to tell me about so and so they know who died from their cancer. Seriously people, that is the last thing I want to hear. Oh and they are asking me because I have to wrap it up in a bunch of guaze, not because I'm deformed. =) Just thought I'd clear that up. I know it could be worse, but this sucks! You all sound like you're doing well! I've enjoyed reading even though I've been busy. Hopefully tomorrow, I'll be able to get some exercise in. I'm at least going to walk. I can't just sit by and let my whole health go b/c of my arm. Thanks for listening to my rant. Hopefully I'll have more positive news next time! Have a good friday everyone!",

Trying to take care of my stupid LE though takes like 2-3 hours a day sometimes so with work it's hard to fit it in. However, on a positive note, I saw a new LE therapist today and she's doing more to help me. My arm is pretty much back to baseline except for my wrist but if I don't massage and wrap it flairs back up. I'm much less emotional about it these days because I have hope. I have hope that God is going to heal me of it. I know not everyone believes that way and I know they say it's a chronic, lifetime condition, but I just can't accept it. =) And that's all I'm gonna say about that. So I'm hoping to get some walks in this week. I had 2 doctor appts today so I don't really have time as I have bible study later. But I'm going to eat a nice healthy dinner of baked chicken and asparagus with yellow peppers and onion. Yum! Suebee- I hope your fill goes better than expected and you have no pain!  I hope everyone had a great and restful weekend. ",

We could make a day trip out of it...a loooong day. But it was fun! Sorry about the thunderstorm. I got my best friend out to go on a walk with me this afternoon at our state park nearby. It was SO nice. I hadn't been in almost a year and that's so embarassing b/c it's less than 4 miles from my house. It was a beautiful evening and JUST as we got in the car, the wind started blowing and hail started flying. whew....we didn't even know anything was coming. I did make it out to plant flowers. I had to take breaks b/c I'm still pooped from chemo. I feel like a little old lady. I'd plant 3 flowers and have to come inside for a rest. =) But I got it done!  And ugh hot dogs...blech. They are good but I almost can't even look at them. I try to be nice and not complain when I'm someone's guest. But usually the hardest time I have is when I'm at my grandmothers. I just respect her so much and its hard for me to refuse anything she pushes my way. I even tried SPAM last year. UGH! She was so excited about it. Spam in a can. Maybe that's what caused my BC. hehe..I only had it once and cringed the whole way home.  Geesh I have a lot to say today. Hope everyone's weekend was nice.

I get motion sick so I have to space it out throughout the day.Sorry about your ruined plans for bike riding! Maria- that bread sounds good! I need to get a bread maker. I found an awesome whole foods store today. I knew it was there but hadn't had time to check it out. It was amazing! For this area anyways. It had all different types of flour which is almost impossible to find around here. I didn't buy much since I didn't have a list and wasn't sure what I would really need. It looks as though it could get expensive in there. I'm so excited though!  Do you have a recipe for the pancakes? I love pancakes, especially if they are healthy. I have a good one made with oats and buttermilk. I'm not sure about buttermilk though. Any thoughts on that? I haven't really researched it.  All I can say is I'm sorry on the MIL issue. She sounds awful. My best friend's MIL has treated her horrible in the past.They've recently bonded slightly over the death of her father but you never know when that could change. I witnessed it first hand. She was nicer to ME!?!?!  And don't get me started on Pasta! I love it! I wish restaurants would offer whole wheat varieties. I honestly love the taste of wheat pasta. Oh well... I started gardening a couple of years ago when my grandfather gave me some tomatoe plants he started. So the first year I just had a small garden. Then last year we planted half the back yard. It was ugly, but it was worth it! We are still eating our own canned grean beans. We canned tomatoes, pickles, pizza sauce, green beans, and salsa. We froze the corn and peppers we planted too. We haven't started it yet this year though. My grandfather just gave me 20 tomatoe plants. We need to get in gear! It's been a struggle though with all my doctor appointments. But I just love it so much I don't think I can skip it this year. My mom said she never did it before because her parents MADE her help in their garden when she was younger and MADE her can all summer. She hated it. But she's excited again and is now enjoying the fruits of her labor. Or should I say vegetables... Oh I was thinking also, you could always eat before you go to your MIL's. Then take a small salad or something. I can't believe she asks you to make something but won't except it if it isn't her recipe. Yikes! I was laughing over the wine comment. It is such a pain though and a lot of work to eat healthy. Don't you feel as though it should be the other way around? Why is it so easy to have unhealthy food in our world today? We have more means of transportation and technology than ever before, and our food industry just gets worse...It puzzles me. Have you ever seen Food Inc.? It makes you think.  My arm is doing ok. Thanks for asking! I went to PT again this morning. She only addressed my cording issue though. I was yet again disappointed. She asked if I wanted to come back. I already had an appt scheduled for Thursday so I think I'll just go and it will be my last time. I'm going to try to find someone new to go to.  I still have some slight swelling in my hand. And my arm hurts a little which makes me think there is fluid in it. I just need a PT that is more proactive. I want it gone, not just better! =) You guys are cracking me up over boob greed. Although I definately think you deserve it. It makes me wonder what I would do in that situation. I've always had D cups and kind of wished I was smaller, but after BC I love them. I'm much more appreciative and think I would probably have boob greed too if I did a mx. I think now I'd just like a lift..haha. Although it's probably a little early in my life to be thinking of that. But years of running have taken their toll. And now after my lumpectomy, the surgeon kind of lifted that side, my other side looks really saggy. She said she would even them out for me sometime next year after I've had time to heal from radiation. =) So I'm thinking I just might do that. I can pass it off as a necessary from BC and it will be covered by insurance! yea! Oh and Maria, let me know how the PORT removal goes. I still have mine. I'm thinking I'm going to keep it through radiation because I have to have weekly blood draws anyways. ",

I felt a little strange wanting to see your all's foobs but since you don't care, I don't care. lol..I'm a nurse so it doesn't bother me too much. Except when it's mine everyone is looking at. Have fun on your vacation! Vacation sounds soooo nice right about now. Hopefully I'll get to go on one soon. If not, I have a trip planned to Florida in December. Maria- my caringbridge site is www.caringbridge.org/visit/melaniejones1 Shannon- high five back! I will check out the forum. My skin is slightly pink so far. I'm hoping with 3 days off and lots and lots of lube that it will calm down. But it doesn't hurt so that's good.  Thanks for the ideas on food. The quiche sounds good. I've also learned that black beans+ brown rice make a complete protien. I'm going to try and incorporate more into my diet. I try eating more meat than I'm used to, but I'm not a big meat eater. But I've been making myself lately. And I do like my roomies. One got engaged over the weekend last week so she is so excited. I think she has her whole wedding planned already..lol. She was up until 4 in the morning the other night b/c she couldn't sleep and made her whole invitation list. haha... I'm not sure yet what my plans for the weekend will include. I'm going this afternoon for my photoshoot...haha, that sounds funny to me. Its an hour and a half drive so I'll probably get back around 6 or so. I'm staying here tonight, sleeping in tomorrow and maybe scrapbooking tomorrow for a while. Something nice and relaxing. Then I may go home. I got invited to go to a rodeo on Sunday. I've gone before. It's kind of fun. But expensive! So we'll see... Last night I decided to go for a run/walk. I was pushing myself to run a little and my stomach was a little upset, I guess from something I ate. Well I ended up with the hiccups FOREVER! haha. I was a sight. Bald head, a huge wrap on my arm, and hiccuping really loud walking down the street. Also had a thing of mace in my hand. People probably thought I went mad. =) Oh well...I got my exercise in yesterday!  Have a great day everyone!",

Sue- I think you should go ahead and do the recreational 20. I think it will be a fun atmosphere to be invovled in. I looked it up and it looked like fun. Feel free to share any good recipes you find! So I thought I didn't have any hair coming in..but lo and behold...I looked at my legs last night. They are so hairy! haha. I definitley need a good shave. The weird thing is though, it didn't come in prickly like normal. It's like having hair of a 12 year old. It's really soft. So then on closer inspection, I can see it growing on my arms too and unfortunately in my armpits. But I think I'll hold off shaving those as long as possible. I don't really think it's noticeable. So I guess the little fuzz on my head is new hair too. It's too short to measure. Maybe 1/32 of an inch..lol. My hope has returned! 17/33 rads down! My armpit is looking pretty dark. And my right side -shoulder/neck area is getting sore. I had to ask to stretch today during treatment b/c I had a muscle in my back that was in spasms. They were nice and let me.  Hopefully I'll make it to the store today. I need razors! And some vegetables. It all depends on how much energy I have. I should have gone after rads but I just wanted to come home. ",

My dad wanted me to go play golf but it's a bit too hot right now for that. Then he wants me to weed the garden. What a slave driver! haha...not really. I said I would help him as much as I was able.  What's everyone's weekend plans? ",

It just looks like I have a big deep bruise. It's almost black. Hmmm? Or the best tan of my life (in one spot)! My breast is red with little darker dots all over it. My nipple is huge...haha and dark. It looks alien to me. I try not to look too much. I think it freaks me out a little. B/c I look over at my other boob and it just looks so darn perfect.  Saturday I was outside for a little helping my friend clean out a locker room for the upcoming cross country season. One of the football coaches looked at me sternly and said..you need a hat on. I said..yea I probably should but I won't be out here long. He's like..you're back is already red. I said..no that's from radiation but thanks for the concern. I thought it was nice.  Red-surgery Thursday?! I'm so behind. Yay! Sue- glad you like the job! It's always nice to have a job that you enjoy going to. Barbara- enjoy the vacation! Shannon- I'm jealous of the yoga! Enjoy it. I'm going to zumba tonight. I'm a little excited except I don't like watching myself in the mirror...haha. Especially since I'm bald. Oh well. I really think this BC thing is teaching me to be less insecure. Some things we just can't control. =) Julie- I forgot what I was going to write to you! I hope you're well!  Today, I was scheduled to get labs done. So I showed up 15 minutes early (when the Cancer center opens) and I was the 2nd person there. Well they proceeded to get me checked in and in the meantime were taking a few people ahead of me that got there after me. Well I was there at 7:15 and once I was in the room waiting for my labs to be drawn I looked down and it was 8:45! My rads appointment was at 8:15. I was so upset. I couldn't get anyones attention so I just got up and left. Just. walked. out. I hope they're looking for me all day. =)  So I show up to rads late and get checked in and ask if they'll just draw labs out of my arm for the day. Well then they had to search for the order, but got around to doing it. So then I waited until about 9:15 for radiation. I was seething! Basically because I have a day and I felt bad having to make the rads techs get off schedule. WEll I think one of the techs thought I was mad at her b/c she apologized for running behind schedule. I kind of laughed and said, I'm the one that was late! And then I explained my morning to her. Ugh! I know it was ridiculous to get so upset but I had other plans for the morning. I was there for 2 hours!  So then I went to Target to get a spanx top for my LE. I got stuck in it and couldn't get out. I just looked at myself in the mirror (my much slimmer self and just sighed...what a day). I finally got out of it and came home sans 90 dollars. Target does it to me every time! I'm putting together a care package for my cousins who are at camp this week. I decided to bake them cookies. I then had a conference call for work and I was baking the cookies at the same time...haha. I hope they didn't hear the oven door opening and closing.  So..I've had a busy, stressful day. It really hasn't been that bad but for some reason I just feel the stress. I need to go workout.. =) I hope everyone else's day is going well. ",

I've been going, going, going since 6:30 this morning. I have 8 more radiaiton treatments! Yea!!!!!!!!!!!! I see the light! I only have 3 more to my armpit which is the reddest and sorest part. I'm starting to get a little itchy but if I put aloe on, sweet relief! I have been going to PT but you'd think I was asking for a million dollars the first time around. They were like...what?!?! you want PT? But I eventually found a great place. It's helping me keep my ROM throughout radiaiton. It's getting pretty tight under there.  So what's on everyone's agenda for today? I went to radiation, PT, and the store. Now I'm making lunch. Then, I'm going to sit down and work...probably the rest of the day. I'm hoping the heat goes down a little this evening so I can get some exercise in. Marie- I'm sorry you're in so much pain! I agree that maybe you and your doc need to sit down and come up with a plan...whether it be surgical or pain management or PT or SOMETHING! Pain makes us crazy! Good approach Red to the R&R. I hope you have a relaxing day! Julie- I've never had a problem with my shoulder but it kills me some days during radiation. Especially if they are slow moving. Or sometimes I get spasms in my back. Not fun!  I'm happy to report that I have a 5 o'clock shadow, on my head!!!!!!!!! My little hair is making a comeback. =) Bye bye baldy! ",

I'm not gonna lie. But I'm not really too uncomfortable. I tried to do zumba last night. Too much jiggling around kind of hurts. At one point, I had a stabbing pain in one part of my breast. But I toned it down a little and it went away. Today I had imaging done for my boosts. It was FOREVER! and my poor arms were killing me. I think I would be able to tolerate it more if I feel like the techs weren't just poking around. Taking their good old time coming in and out of the room between treatments. I can't wait to be done.

We are doing a flash mob dance at our local farmers market tomorrow morning. Maybe you'll get to see it on FB. One of the girls said she would post it. She's making her husband come and tape us...lol. ***Now for my Rant*** So I go to Rads today for my 1st of 5 boosts. Only 4 more days of radiation for me! So I was excited. But where do I start with the frustration? I feel like my doc talks to me like I'm 5 and he doesn't explain things very well. I asked him SEVERAL times where the boosts were going to be. He said, to the original tumor bed. So I said..no more to my lymph nodes right? He said correct. Well lo and behold, they radiation my axilla today. I mean...I consider those my lymph nodes. So I ask him. I thought we were just radiating the tumor bed on the breast...he said yes, that's right. I said..so why did they radiate my axilla today? He said to get the tumor from the other side...I said. oh that makes sense. So they're not radiating my axilla. He said...yes they are. OMG. I just don't understand him. GRRRRRRRRRR and that's not even where it ends.  So my skin is getting super red! And it kind of hurts to stretch my skin at all (like putting my arm over my head.) So the techs told me to ask for silvadene cream. I said..oh can you only get that once your done with treatment? They said..no, you can use it the whole time. So i'm thinking to myself..why do they wait until there is a problem to treat it? But I wasn't too concered at this point. So when I saw the doc today I asked about silvadene. Well..I find out I'm allergic. It has sulfa in it. So nix that idea. He said, don't worry, the nurses will come up with something else. So she comes back in and tells me about this radiation gel strips that they have. But they are out. So they send me to wal-mart to get some and told me to bring them back and they would help me apply them. So I go. I get there and ask. They don't know what I'm talking about. She gets the pharmacist. He says he has ordered some for the cancer center yesterday but they are on back order until MID AUGUST! I said..well I won't need them then. I just wanted to start crying. Can they be any more frustrating. I mean..don't you think you should watch your supply and make sure you have enough? Especially for pt's with allergies! So I'm going back to the cancer center here in a minute to talk to them. I'm frustrated beyond belief if you can't tell. =) Thanks for listening! Oh, and then I was telling him that it hurt a little and he said...do you need pain medicine? I hate that question. I know some people like pain medicine and it some cases it is warranted but for heaven's sake my skin is burnt. Can we treat the problem not try to mask the SE's? No I don't need pain medicine...I want something to help heal my skin.  One more time...GRRRRRRRRRRR Yea..I might need a nap sometime today... =)",

On my 5th round, we finally found out that Zyprexa worked well for me. After each treatment I was sick for at least 4 days. I never threw up, but I was extremely nauseated! And it always hit me right away! By my last treatment, this is what I took to try and cope with the nausea- Emend, Aloxi, Benadryl, Ativan, Pepcid, Decadron, Phenergen, and Zyprexa. Hopefully yours won't come to that but I just think everyone is different and some are more senstive than others. I hope you're doing well now!  Melanie",

You're going to burn anyways, but it probably won't happen until sometime around your 25th treatment. The cream might help you go a few more days without burning, but it's going to happen anyways, so you don't really need to worry about it right now. Um, hello? I'll take a few days. Geeeeeeeeesh! Whatever. I'm putting the cream alllll over me! =)  Emily, have you been able to make an appointment with a LE therpaist yet? I started seeing one consistently last week. My hand is mainly the only thing I notice swelling. Mine started about 12 weeks ago though so I can't blame it on rads either. I don't know what triggered mine. I've heard though that early treatment is key to getting it under control. Have you visited the LE boards yet? They are full of helpful information. And I'm not comfortable during rads either. It is very uncomfortable for me in my shoulders...",

I was making dinner this evening, homemade chicken nuggets and mac and cheese. I also made kale chips which turned out aweful, so my mom made some broccoli to make up for it. I haven't had mac and cheese in probably years but found a good recipe in a magazine and decided to try it. It was different than your good ole kraft but I thought it was even better. So as I'm making up a plate, a car pulls up in our driveway and my dad asks, who's car is that? I have no idea, but figure it's one of my dad's clients. (He's a lawyer and his office is in our house and he often has ppl show up at odd times to talk) So I go about my business but look back outside to see one of my best friends from high school getting out of the car. I respond with, Oh it's Kylea. Then my eyes get huge and I'm like...OMG it's KYLEA. haha...she moved to Alaska 8 months ago and I didn't think she was coming home for a visit until the fall. Well she got some unexpected time off and flew in today and suprised her parents and then came to see ME! She only told a few people she was coming in case she didn't get to see many people, but she told my mom 4 weeks ago to make sure I would be home. I was so ecstatic! I just couldn't believe it and it was soooo good catching up with a friend who flew 4000 miles to see me. =)  So anyways, after she left, I couldn't remember what I had planned for the evening, but finally did. So I made it back to the good old treadmill, walked about 45 min and then did some squats and lunges. Whew my legs were burning! But it feels good! Then I did some arm stretches and my lymph massage. -I should have known there were probably already recipe threads..duh. I just haven't looked. I like sharing here too! Rennasus- a hike sounds like so much fun. I should find someone to go hiking with me. I can't remember the last time I did that.  Does anyone else have a supersonic sense of smell after chemo. I was sitting in the living room today and kept getting a wiff of something awful. Turns out it was bad oranges in our kitches in the other room. ugh...bad smells really nauseate me! And when oranges go bad, they really stink. I'd rather do that walk through the citrus farm! Especially packing material in anything we get in the mail...so weird.  Anyways, wanted to share my good story of the day and the fact that I met my goals. I should know that I always feel bad for a week and not be so hard on myself. But when I start to feel good, I'm always in a much better mood.  Have a good day tomorrow laides. I'll be thinking of you tomorrow Maria when you do chemo. Tomorrow right?",

I go on a binge before a chemo b/c I know food won't taste good for almost 2 weeks. I know I probably shouldn't but it's so hard to stop. I'm back on the wagon today though. If I didn't I know it would make me feel worse tomorrow. Not really doing much exercising. The lymphedema specialist told me to hold it for now. I did take about a mile walk on Saturday though. I can't just sit around and get all soft. haha. I don't think that would be very beneficial in any way. Thanks so much for asking about my arm. I thought it was going better but noticed more swelling in the palm of my hand yesterday. I went to PT today and i've had a 7% increase in size since last week. =( She assures me that it is still at a stage that it can be reversed. But now, instead of a sleeve and a hand wrap, my whole arm has this huge contraption on it to hold down the swelling. It's so bulky and bigger than any cast I've ever seen. I had to laugh a little. I would just love for it to be gone! So I think for the next week or so I'm going to listen better. Absolutley no lifting anything, no repetitive movements. Wonder if typing counts?.,, I'm still going to try to walk a few times this week.  If I don't check in in a few days it's because I'm in post chemo land. Which for me, means sleeping pretty much for 4 days. I may though. I get pretty bored at times.  Have a great week everyone! Anyone have any suggestions on good stuff to eat when you're nauseous but that are healthy too? What do you all eat post chemo? Sorry if there are typos. My ROM in my fingers is limited. =)",

I will say though that my nausea was a little better this time. They gave me Zyprexa which is usually used for bipoloar disorders. I didn't really want to take it but would have done anything to reduce the nausea. And it worked! I still have it a little but I don't have to put myself to sleep to put up with it! =) On another positive note- I had my arm fully wrapped at PT on Monday and when I took the wrap off later to do the massage again, I could see the veins and knuckles in my hand. I think I almost cried! Maybe I did. I can't remember...However, wrapping is a pain, and I want to cry every night when I do it. It's so frustrating. BUT I'm trying to be more positive. I think once I get better at it and more used to it, it won't stress me out as much. Thanks for letting me vent! Thanks for the info Maria on the body fat for ER/PR+ BC. I had just started looking into that. I sat down with my parents and we all have come up with goals on what we want to change (diet, wieght, body fat, stamina, etc.) I bought all of us little notebooks to keep daily logs of our exercise and food and we're going to weigh in once a week. haha..it's my own biggest loser. But my goal is to lose body fat. I'm at 27%. Actually better than I used to be but I'd like to be around 20.  My weight yo-yo's from chemo. I definiately crave the carbs afterwards but I also crave protien. I ate 4 eggs for breakfast this morning. They were heavenly. =) And my sweet mother just made me a sweet potatoe with cinnamon on it for lunch.  I'm feeling much more positive today! Thanks for all of the support and keep up the great work ladies! =) Oh, and I didn't watch the wedding. I taped it though and may watch it later. I was too drugged to get up. Steriods have the opposite affect on me and make me feel like crap. Ugh, I hate them! ",

I'm having trouble sleeping and I think it was due to inactivity. I was just trying to follow orders from the LE therapist. I think no exercise can be more harm than good sometimes. But anyways I have another confession. I ate horrible yesterday! You would think it was PMS...if I still had a period..haha. I just could not stop eating...and I have to give you the rundown. I need my hand slapped. =) enchiladas, those creme filled wafters- ( I had like 8 of them, that's at least 600 calories..ughh), popcorn, half a pop tart, pancakes (from a box), eggs, a smoothie and some crackers...oh my word, my stomach hurts just thinking about it. But I feel better after confessing. I will do much better today!  I'm going to just pop on over to Maria's blog to see about cooking something healthy today.  I also went to PT yesterday. I wasn't happy with the visit. I've gone for about 4 weeks now and I never actually have any therapy done. So I called a different one and I'm going in for a second opinion for my lymphedema next Monday. I think I was so upset, I just ate and ate and ate. Guess that makes me an emotional eater. I'm better now though. Suebee- I will be praying that a job comes available to you, and not just any ole job, the RIGHT job! I seriously need to buy a bike. You're bike rides are so motivational. Got any suggestions?  Redsky- great job on the eating healthy and exercise! yea!!!! Thanks for the motivation. Rennausas- OMG BBQ ribs...my mouth is watering. =) Annie- I feel your 'pain.' That always happens to me for about 5 days post chemo. I'm moving again and hope you are too! Have a great day ladies! I'm planning to! ",

I bought it a few years ago, but I'm not sure I ever took the time to read it all the way through. Maybe I should give it a shot. I've really been trying to cut back on the carbs, especially starting mid-afternoon for the rest of the day. I'm not sure if it's working yet. My parents and I are weighing ourselves once a week on Saturday nights to stay consisitent. So we'll see... I got in another walk last night. It was really nice. And my arm does seem under control. I still notice some swelling in my hand and that irritates me. So I'm looking for a new LE therapist since mine doesn't seem to take me seriously. But I think I'm managing it well right now. On that same note, I knew I had a PT appointment today but I thought it was in the afternoon. Well I got out my little appt card to see exactly what time it was and it was in 20 minutes!  I had to call and reschedule b/c I live 45 minutes away...and I'm still in my  pajamas...haha. OOps! I have too many appointments! I'm going on a little retreat this weekend so you won't hear from me. I get back Sunday night. So I hope everyone has a wonderful weekend! Painfree and worry free! Supersally- sorry you had a stressful day. Happy Birthday! I hope the evening went a little smoother. Maria- I don't know about you, but I get more anxious and irritated when they tell me to take more medicine. That's exactly what I don't want to do. I'm sorry you're feeling anxious. I hope all your plans work out for your good. Maybe you won't have to be at work too long... I keep wondering if I'm pushing myself too much by still trying to work full time...i.e. missing appointments. I'm so scatter-brained, and feel like I'm putting thousands of miles on my car. I'm almost looking forward to radiation b/c I'm moving up near the hospital where I get treatment for 6 weeks. I feel as though I'll be less stressed b/c that will take away some of my job responsibilities (although I work mainly from home)  and other responsibilities at home. Kind of sucks that it takesa serious illness to make us slow down. Suebee- let us know how DH's interview goes! And congrats on the C cup! Growing up, I used to loathe how 'big' I was. All of my friends were teeny tiny. It took me awhile to realize that all of their constant comments about my big boobs was because they were jealous. So then, when I faced a mastectomy, I was horrified. I learned to appreciate myself in a whole new way. I chose not to do the mastectomy and just do a lumpectomy. So my D cups are still hanging around and I couldn't be more thankful!  Redsky- Happy Anniversary!  Rennasus- A getaway sounds soooo nice! My family was going to go on vacation in June but  now I think we're going to post-pone. =( I just can't fit it in with all these appointments. So hopefully we'll get to go in August. Hope your hike goes well! Sounds fun. Have a great day girls!",

I think it will start to feel more real once the three week cycle goes around again, and I don't have to do it again. I'm so relieved. This last one was so hard. I get more and more nauseous every time I go in. So now I'm in recovery phase. It takes me awhile. Hopefully I'll get a short walk in today or tomorrow. My exercise has really taken a hit these past few weeks with chemo and LE. I've also been really lazy when it's come to taking care of my arm. And guess what...? I don't really notice any swelling now. My hand seems to be back to normal. Maybe I was just working against it. The OT I saw on Tuesday said that she hopes it will settle down now that I won't have so much medicine going through me. I'm just pleased that my hand looks good and that I haven't had to mess with it in the post chemo haze.  It's so nice to be back in touch. I've been eating whatever my mom has made me. =) I had a friend bring me organic meat from her farm and we had baked steak, green beans out of our garden from last year, and some mashed potatoes for dinner last night and leftovers for lunch today. It was sooo delicious.  I can't wait for my tastebuds to come back and my dry mouth to heal. I'm just so darned excited to be done with chemo. I have RADS next though...but I'm optimistic that it will go smoothly. Great job on the exercising ladies! I'm hoping to join you all soon and getting back into shape. I'm still hoping to lose some body fat. Since starting our new family fitness plan a few weeks ago, my dad has lost 14 pounds! I'm so proud of him.  Alright, this post is probably long enough. I don't even know what I've said...haha. I may need a nap. I'll be back to normal in a few days. =) Redsky-I'm so sorry about your mom. Saying a prayer for her and your family today.  Renn- Sorry about the decisions you're having to face post treatment. I pray that your final decision gives you peace! And that you have some fun in LV! ",

I want people to UNDERSTAND..althought most of the time it's really difficult if you haven't been there yourself. Whew, so much to catch up on!  Sue- glad your recovery is going well! Keep it up!  Maria-  sorry you're experiencing so much stress with the move. I just moved (temporarily) for radiation. I left packing to the last minute..got about 5 hours of sleep, drove 1.5 hours to radiation, then moved my stuff in. haha...I really should try to be more organized. I had mixed emotions about leaving home. I was excited but at the same time stressed about having to pack. I just want to sleeeep! But I think once I get settled for the next few weeks, it will be better. I have a good friend that works for Amazon. She's in Lexington, KY now but has gone to Seattle a few times for conferences and absolutley loves it there. She said its one of the best cities for healthy eating and activities. She was telling me all about the farmer's market's they have there year round. Just a little positive thing. I have no idea about the other places...Just remember, you have your DH and DS and no matter where life takes you, you'll be together. =)  supersally- you sound like me...lol. I'm \"working\" and catching up...haha. And 5 weeks chemo and my legs are still shot. I go for a walk and I'm sore for like 2 days. Keep on pushing though. I believe it will get better.  Shannon- I hope your appointment goes/went well today!  And all this talk of constipation...I've been there too. I would go about 5 days and notice I hadn't gone...oops! Then it was terrible trying to make myself go. I would just recommend pear juice. My friend bought it for me once and it worked like a charm. On top of that I also took the colace.  I had a good weekend. I grew up going to a church camp and intermittently continue to counsel during the summer. I'm not able to this year but my brother and nephew are there all week so I went for the weekend to spend time with them. It was nice! That's about all I did. I spent time in the great outdoors. It was so refreshing. Oh and I did have a bday party friday night. It went really well! My grandparents even suprised us and showed up. They live about 2 hours away and my grandpa is 81 and he doesn't like to be in the car that much. So it was nice that they came.  I had my first radiation this morning. It was so strange. I expected to feel something even though everyone told me I wouldn't. Just zip, bam, boom and you're done...32 more to go! Have a great evening everyone! I just moved into a house with 2 girls I don't know, but it's going well so far, and they're really nice and supportive. (I met them through a friend) And we're all going out for dinner tonight. ",

There is a local pharmacy where I am that carries it b/c the radiation department requested it. I know there are prescription creams that you can get but my insurance wouldn't cover any so they recommended miaderm. They said it worked as well as the others and was cheaper if you didn't have insurance. 7 down and so far, so good. I was excited today b/c I found out that I only have radiation 4 times next week due to the holiday. The tech girls acted bummed that I was so happy I wouldn't have to see them one day. They were kidding. They said it would probably be nice for me to have 3 days off. And they're right! Maria- the occupational therapist that I'm seeing for my LE says she hasnt really seen LE that has presented like mine. It's mainly in my hand and the worst in my palm. She said she usually to never sees it in anyones palm. So she's called at least one other LE therapist that she knows to ask and she also said she doesn't usually see it. So she wanted me to ask my oncologist. So I did...and he said he didn't know. Of course... So I guess it's working a little bit if I constantly wrap and massage my arm every single day. If I miss a day, it puffs back up. They also said that it probably does that b/c I'm actively undergoing treatment and that once I'm done, it should settle down. I'm getting used to it a little. But that does NOT mean I want it to stay. Thanks for asking! Renn- definately request some PT!!!! I had cording as well and it took seeing 3 PT's for them to take me seriously. I INSISTED! Mainly b/c I was having rads and I've read that it will only make it worse if you don't take care of it before hand. My arm is soooooo much better. It's still slightly stiff when I raise it all the way up but before I couldn't even lift my arm up halfway straight. And my cording is pretty much gone! But if you do go, do not over do it! I think that's what started my lymphedema. They overstretched my arm and caused it to flair up. I'm almost convinced of it.  Shannon- You're doing great with exercise but I agree with Maria- adding at least one day at the gym would be so good for you! Or do you have hand weights? You could follow along on a dvd at home if you're too self conscious to go to the gym right now. I don't have a gym membership so that's what I normally do.  Sue thanks for the advice on the pic forum. I actually wasn't sure how to get on it. Is it the same one you were talking about in your previous post? that I have to message someone? Thanks! Are your bras underwire? I need some without underwire but I'm a D and it's a little hard to find a good bra without underwire. I've read that underwire can make your LE flair up, expecially in your back.  Ugh and all this talk about Tamoxifen...I'm not looking forward to it. I start after radiation. And I'm still constantly getting hot flashes and my weight has been creeping up, not down. But I feel like finally (hopefully) I'm getting into some sort of routine. So I need to pick back up with the exercise. It's been a few days. I had a friend come visit me this weekend. It's hard to get in exercise with visitors b/c I always feel like I need to entertain. So, back at it for me today. It's nice weather so I should be able to go for a nice walk/run. So my oncologist wanted to see me today. He emailed me late last night and told me to have them page him when I arrived this morning (for labs and radiation). His nurse then saw me and said he had something he wanted to ask me. I was sooo curious. But then my friend showed up and went with me to see him and he didn't end up asking me anything. He said he just wanted to see me, to see how I was doing. He is leaving for India this week for 3 weeks. And I see him when he gets back. It was a little strange. In addition, he had called me over the weekend b/c he wanted to ask me a question. He wanted to know how I handled my diagnoses and treatment so well. He said he had never met anyone as calm and peaceful as me. hehe...it was a little strange but nice. I shared with him my faith and God and also talked about my support system on here and in my community. So today, I thought he was going to ask me more about it, but there were others in the room so I'm not sure if he really wanted to talk about that, or really just see me before he left. So who knows...maybe I'll find out. ",

I need someone with first hand experience.\" Not sure if he was serious or not but we'll see. I have a job for at least 3 more months. I'm working for a health care consulting company right now on a research/court case in WV. It has to do with a chemical plant and it dumping waste into the river. We're collecting data on diseases in the area. It's really interesting. I get to work mainly from home, but I also go to Dr. offices and scan records. So it's been a really nice job while I'm going through this. But the contract ends in September so I need to start looking for a new one. I would work for my ONC but it depeneded on what he wanted me to do. I don't think I would want to do infusions or work in the lab...I don't like sticking ppl with needles. =) But I did work for almost 3 years on a surgical/trauma floor/stepdown unit. I think it traumatized me for life...haha.   Sue- that walk sounds heavenly but really tiring! I just tried to go for a walk but I slept too late. It's way too hot out. I think I made it about 1.5 miles. I just don't want my arm to swell up so I came back home. I might walk more later...we'll see.  The photo shoot went well! It was really quick and simple. She has everyone wear a black shirt and then does all the shots in natural light. I can't wait to see them. And to show them to everyone! I think I'm going to go to the grocery store today, and cross all canned items off my list. =( Then maybe do some scarpbooking this afternoon. The girls here went to the pool but I just can't be in the heat or sun with this radiation going on, and the LE, and I'm not allowed to get in the pool. So I passed. =( Oh well....I'll spend some quality time by myself. haha. Have a great day girls!",

Since I finished rads last week, I have been super busy it seems. I feel like a chicken with it's head cut off. I just made a to do list that is two pages long. UGH!  Most of the things I'd like to do are getting pushed to the back burner in order to do things that have been or are planned by other people. And they expect me to be there. I know I'm done with treatment but I know I'm not 100%. I don't want to be babied but I would also like a little respect for what I just went through...Anyone else feel this way? I feel as though I need about 2 weeks cut off from the world so I can get things done.  Anyways..life has been good though, despite being really busy. I am helping with our local middle school/high school cross country teams. It is so much fun to run with those kids. Even when I'm having a bad day, when I hit the trails and run with them, I usually feel 100% better afterwards. I just wish it wasn't so darn hot outside! I wouldn't mind...except for the LE. It seems to irritate it a bit.  Just wanted to give a little update. I hope everyone's week is going well. =) ",

Maria-I read a little of your blog and needed a good kick in the butt reminder about surger. =) I was so good about it for 2 months, until about 2 weeks after my first chemo. It was the only thing that tasted the same to me so I've been indulging too much. Thanks for the reminder about how much better our bodies will respond to chemo when we treat it well. I needed that.  I'm planning on running/walking a 10k next weekend. I did it last year and am no way in as good of shape as I was then but I'm still going to participate.  Thanks ladies!

I know that is so depressing to hear but I haven't found much relief with strecthing. I also have lymphedema now so it kind of complicates the process. They tell me no stretching for right now. So I don't really have full range of motion in my arm anymore but I'm going to PT so I'm hoping we'll start working on that soon. My oncologist wanted my arm fully recovered before radiation but seeing as that is in about 7 weeks, I'm not so sure that's going to happen. I'll still be a little hopeful though. I will say though, that mine isn't so uncomfortable that I have to take anything for it. Most of the time I don't notice unless I try to overstretch my arm. But that is intermittent. I felt great for about 6 weeks after surgery. Then the cording started. It hurt for awhile, then got better, then hurt again for a few weeks. So I'm not sure! Sorry I can't be of more help. ",

DO THEY NOT UNDERSTAND...that frequent treatment is the key to getting it under control. I'm so upset! Plus I'm trying to schedule it around my radiation treatments and they are 45 minutes apart, plus trying to continue working full time. It's not getting any easier. =(  Ok rant over...they said they would call me back.  Then I went to my radiation appointment and they put X's on me for a CT scan, then told me I had to come back on friday for my tattoos...I thought that's what I was going for yesterday. So now I have to drive an hour and a half again on Friday. Then I'm moving up there Sunday. Stressful stressful stressful.  Then, my mom and I decided to go on a walk when I got home. I made it 3 miles! Quite an achievement for me lately. But it wasn't a very pleasant walk. My mom and I got in an arguement of all things...about what I wanted to do for my birthday. It's a long story, but I JUST wanted people to spend a little time with me. I don't want  your money, your cards, or your gifts. I want time. Anyone else starting to feel this way? I mean, I'm very appreciative of everything everyone has done, but still just lonely sometimes. Everyone talked about throwing a big after chemo party for me...and they get my hopes up, and then nothing. Life is so disappointing sometimes. I knew you all would understand. Sorry to unload it all though. =) My mom started complaining about how her house was a mess, and she couldn't cook for too many people and all kinds of excuses. And then she said, \"You're not even going to be here to help.\" B/c I have a radiation appt the day I want to have the party. I said...well it's not very much fun organizing, planning, and inviting everyone to your own bday party. I know I'm being a little dramatic, but I look around at all the people who were wailing over me 6 months ago b/c they couldn't imagine life without me. And now all I see is that everyone is too busy to care. Ok, seriously I'm done with the pity party.  I think I'm just an emotional mess over my arm, and moving, and starting radiation next week. And today is my birthday! I guess I just want people to understand, but I guess they really can't.  Ok, have a great day ladies! Hopefully next time, I'll be in better spirits! And maybe have a little happiness on my bday. =) ",

It truly made my day.  Maria- I didn't have to pull out the CB card. They called me and said they had a cancellation in the morning. Yay! I'm not good at being mean...except to my family. With them, it just comes naturally. But I have learned to stand up for myself more through this.  Sue- talking about modesty...before BC, no one had ever seen my breasts, and I mean NO ONE. Even my gyno would feel under a sheet at my yearly exams. Kinda weird when I think about it now, but whatever. So I started keeping track. And in about a week I was up to around 20 people and that was even before surgery. I'm getting more used to, hey everyone, nice to meet you, and here are my breasts...lol. I feel bad for my DH down the road.  Enjoy your dinner Shannon! Sounds like a great celebration to me.  I didn't have cake today, but I plan to on Friday when we have my little party that we all finally agreed on.  Renn,  I need to get over there and read your blog. I''m excited. I have one too, but haven't posted it. Maybe I will.  Supersally- I think I have too much alone time working from home, but I too, love my me time.  I love chipotle too. We don;t have one though. =(",

I can even get my ring back on my finger, that I used to wear all the time.

It definitely made me feel better. I even did my post op exercises for my arm. Maria-I do have a slew of arm exercises. I have seen the lymphedema specialist as well as the physical therapist. They give me exercises and say \"well, I'd like to see you before Radiation\" Which is frustrating because that's 3 months away. And the exercises don't seem to be changing anything in the armpit area. But I did get a referral from my doc last week to see a different lymphedema specialist and also get into some lymphedema prevention classes, which I'm excited about. Maybe she'll have more ideas for me. And do you have the recipe for those brownies? Sounds great! I have also read that book. It was very interesting and enlightening! I'm sorry for those experiencing pain with their reconstruction process. I had a lumpectomy so I'm not very familiar with the process but I hope you all feel well today and are pain free!  I'm just working today so nothing too exciting. I'm hoping to get in some exercise later. My white counts are pretty close to zero so I'll probably hit up the treadmill at home. But I'm feeling so much better than chemo last week that I have no complaints. Hope everyone has a great and productive day! Melanie",

She thinks we caught it early though so hopefully with action I can get rid of it. So I've been massaging it today and wrapping it in guaze. I look like a mummy...or Michael Jackson...haha. I went shopping for a little bit this evening and some girl in the store asked if I got burned....so I guess here come the questions and the stares..as if a scarf wasn't enough. I'm trying to stay positive though. I just want my hand to look normal again.  So needless to say, I didn't get my exercise in today. I did run two miles yesterday though, and I tried holding my arm up the whole way. It was pretty hilarious. So hopefully I'll get a good walk in tomorrow. The Lymphedema specialist told me to take it easy for a few days. Ugh...that's so hard for me, but I'm going to try. And I had chick-fil-a tonight. =( I had some chicken, salad, and fruit. I'm not sure I want to know what was in it. I'm definitley taking my lunch to work with me tomorrow. That Mexican meatloaf sounds delicious! I may have to try that. I love refried beans.

I can't imagine what it would be like to discuss all of this with a DH, as I dont' have one...but I imagine it would be difficult. I find it difficult to bring up anything to anyone most of the time. I just hate being knocked down and told...oh you're going to be fine, oh, you look fine, and so on and so on. However, yesterday a woman at church came up to me and asked the usual question. How are you doing? And she looked me straight in the eye and said, \"I know you tell us good and fine all the time, but I want to know how you're doing in here.\" And she pointed to my heart when she said that. It was so sweet. So I really shared with her how I was and how anxious I was about my arm. And she said she would specifically pray for that. It was nice. I get about 50 million how are you's a day and most of the time I know people just want to here, I'm good...so that's what I tell them. Plus, I had a great conversation with my BFF last night. We were on the phone for a good 2 hours and she let me rant about how life feels so mixed up at times. It was nice to actually share with someone and not to be falsely reassured the whole time. So I thanked her.  I am soooo glad we are all here to talk, b/c I know you all understand. =)  I'm doing pretty good though. I have days where I'm fine and others when I'm not. Yesterday I tried to go on a walk with my mom but didn't make it very far. My arm was sooo achy and so was my back. But I go to the new Lymphedema therapist tomorrow so I'm excited! I just sat here and wrote down every date so far that I've seen someone for my condition and the outcome of those. I want results this time! I hope everyone has a good day. I go in tomorrow also to have my radiation simulation. My first tattoo...how lucky am I? =) I'll try to update tomorrow. ",

I also bought some 100% aloe and use that a couple of times a day as well. I ALSO bought Miaderm. It is an actual cream created by radiation doctors for radiation. They gave me samples at the office and then told me where to go to get it. You can buy some online at www.miaderm.com. I really like it. It's nice and smooth. Can anyone tell that I don't want to burn...lol. So I kind of switch between the 3. I use aquaphor at night b/c it's real thick. I don't think I could stand that through the day. But right after my treatment I put miaderm all over the area before I put my clothes back on. I've only had 5 treatments but so far so good. I'll hopefully update more later. I've been reading all your posts. You all sound great! My brother is visiting from SC and my friend also came in to visit this weekend. So I should probably go hang out! =) I'll be back soon though. Probably tomorrow night.  Oh, and I wore my wig today for the first time. I'm a little tired of being bald. It was sooo funny. I wore it to church and a few people asked my parents if I didn't feel well today b/c they didn't see me there. I was sitting right next to them! Kind of like having a different personality.

I hope you get a good nights rest! Renn- I didn't really cry much when I got my diagnosis, when I had surgery, or when I went through chemo. I think it's just starting to hit me now. And once you've been so strong I feel as though it's more difficult for people to see you cry b/c they think you should always be strong. I feel like they are a little less forgiving. So it's really difficult for me to even let people see me upset. I just need a good cry now and then. =) I pray that this incision heals quick and that you are on your way to a full recovery!  Sue- do you know a MIssy Spangler? I have no idea how big Dayton is, but I went to high school with her and she owns her own insurance agency there. I think it's cool that you claim Boston b/c I've never been there. I'm not sure anyone would want to stop at my hometown on the tour. It's soooo small! But then again, maybe it would be fun. There's a state park nearby. We could rent a cabin. Ok, I've got to stop making plans, but wouldn't it be fun!?!? Supersally- I do have facebook, but I haven't been on in a while.

Retail therapy is always nice. Except I'm starting to hate people staring at me, and asking what is wrong with my arm. OHHh well. Parents should teach there children not to stare. Haha..I'm only kidding. Little kids don't bother me. I think they're so cute when they ask what's wrong with my hair. Usually they are the ones that are most sincere. But anways, we then went for a walk downtown and ate a cute little restaurant and then had some gelato. OMG it was soooooooo good. I'm trying to avoid sweets but it's so dang hard sometimes. =( My goal is to not have any this weekend at my grandparents. It would be a real accomplishment if I'm able to say no. Wish me luck.  I go for radiation in the morning, then PT, then I'm driving a couple of hours to my grandparents. I'm not sure if I'll be able to check in this weekend but I'll try.

I finally broke down and called the ONC and he had me come in today for testing to rule out pericarditis or a PE, etc. Good news is, everything was normal and my heart is still as healthy as ever! He thinks it could be esophagitis or costochondritis. So then he tells me to take Tylenol. Wish I would have done that first...haha. I have felt much better this evening after doing that. And I suffered for 2 days! I was a little worried though. So, in other words, I haven't really exercised in the past 2 days. Spent all day today at the Cancer Center...bleh. I think I get nauseated now just being there. Although the people are super nice so that's a plus. Anyways, my goal this week is to first start some walking again and get the blood pumpin. Then I'm going to start some strength training in my core and legs since I have been severely lacking in that department the past couple of months. My arm is still a little messed up from surgery with some webbing so I need to get stretching (which I did yesterday!) Yay me. So the resistance training will have to wait on the arms. Just wanted to let you know my goals for this week. =) It helps to speak them out, so I will have to actually keep to my word and do them! Maria- I think the blog idea would be wonderful! I would be a faithful follower. Suebee-I used to get terrible shin splints in high school. It wasn't until college, when my coach finally evaluated my running stride and bought me shoes for my stride/weight/body type, that I haven't had much of a problem with shin splints since. And I used to go to PT 3 times a week for a couple of years for them. Now, that may not be the case with you, but just wanted to share what worked for me if you really miss it. I sometimes think I need to do other excerising b/c my body is so used to running. Maybe next I'll try some Pilates or Yoga. I've heard it's good for BC patients. Supersally-I heard ya about the rough weekend. I had one too! Chemo is not for the faint of heart. Did someone say that on here and I just totally copied them? I can't remember. =) sorry if I did, but it must have stuck with me. Annie-washing hair sounds nice. I can't wait until I have hair again to wash. I love the feel of the water running through my hair...ahhh. -Seriously, I don't know how I would do any of this without my mom. She takes me to all my appointments and takes care of me afterwards. Even listens to me whine and complain. Today she got up bright and early to drive me an hour and a half to get all my testing done. Then, halfway through the day she started not feeling well. So it turns out, when we get home, she has a fever! And I've been around her all day with no immune system. I need some prayers tonight! Ok, I just wrote a book. I'm excited to start my day tomorrow with some exercise. I will report back.",

I'm really not looking forward to Tamoxifen but I'm thankful that it is an option for me.  SueBee- I second the good lucks with the job search. I may be in your boat very soon. I have a temporary job which has lasted for almost 2 years now, but it supposedly is ending in September. I haven't really started looking for something else yet because they say they could possibly have other work for me. I don't know what to do because I really enjoy the company I work for and they have been so good to me through all of this.  I love mexican too. Maria, that mexican casserole sounds heavenly! I'd also be intesrested in mexican lasagna. I've never had it, but I love all things Mexican! Except when I'm nauseous of course. =) Tonight is going to be Mexican here as well. I'm making chicken and black bean enchiladas. I've never made it before so I can't even recall what is in the recipe at the moment, but I'm excited! I live with my parents and when I feel well I've pretty much taken over the cooking because if not, my options would probably not be the best for me. Don't get me wrong, because my mom is a great cook, but even though I've talked a lot about hormone, additive free options, she doesn't really care that much. She will fix meals though with hormone free meat now or I won't eat it. =) And I figured that if the ladies out there with spouses and children can go through chemo and still manage some meals, then I can too. And so far so good. My parents have been enjoying the meals and I think my mom has loved a break from cooking.  I got my exercise in last night. 45 min on the treadmill. I need to switch it up a bit, but most of the time I don't work out until around 9 or 10 at night and so my options are limited. I did do some resistance stuff with my legs the other day and OMG my legs were so sore yesterday. That just shows me how inactive I've become. But I'm making a comeback! Have a great day everyone!",

We should all try to meet up one day when we're \"done.\" -On the food note- I am also hormone positive and at first was deathly afraid to eat anything. I lost about 15 pounds but I was just so darned worried all the time. So I will share an experience I had with you. We had a guest evangelist come and speak at our church back in February. He was done preaching and then all of a sudden said, wait a minute. I have a word for someone here. He then opened his Bible- and I honestly can't remember the scripture, but it was all about do no worry about what you eat, etc, etc. I'll try to find it. So then he said, the Lord does not want you to fret and worry over what you eat or don't eat. Whether this type of meat or sugar is going to harm you. I felt like he was specifically speaking to me. He said, pray over you're food and the Lord will bless you. I don't want to live in worry or fear the rest of my life about what I eat because I think it detracts from the joy of it. Now, don't get me wrong. I still want to eat as healthy as possible, because honestly it just makes me feel good. But I don't want the fear. So I've taken to praying over my food much more than I used to. I still struggle with it. Even last night, on the phone with my best friend, I was saying..'I just don't know what to do! I don't know how cautious to be or not to be.' Bless the Lord, my friend takes me seriously and she is praying about it with me and for me. When I come to any realizations I'll let you know. It is a hard place to be. We want to be so in control of something we may or may not of ever had any control over.  I love your recipes though and your strive for better health and food, because I honestly am starting to enjoy it too. I love to cook/ bake and it just feels better, knowing it's better food. But I just still am struggling with fear. So I just eat as well as I can at home and try not to stress when I go out. I still make healthy choices but I know I can't control whether the meat is hormone free or not at most restaurants. And I think it's perfectly reasonable to take your own food to your MIL's house. If you don't like the food, bring your own! I don't think I could eat what she had. It kind of makes me sick to even think about it. And I'm just going to keep praying. For guidance specifically. Because that's all I know to do. =) Just my two sense in a book form..haha. I hope it helps some. Keep sharing with us. My friend also said that the Lord doesn't give us knowledge and expect us not to do anything about it. I do think commerically processed food is not good and could stand to be improved. I started planted a garden a couple years ago. I feel I'm at least doing something... The weather is gorgeous here today as well! I'm looking forward to at least a walk outside and hopefully planting some flowers for my mom today. I do it every year for mother's day but I'm a little behind. I'm so glad to be done with chemo. I feel like I can start expecting to have good days and to keep feeling better and better.  I'm so glad for our group here and support! Makes me smile to come and 'chat' with you all. I hope everyone has a great day. And that those TE's and incisions don't cause too much stress today. ",

He assured me that they were all normal...(headaches, back pain, neuropathy, fatigue..etc.) He said though that if I want a follow up PET scan then we can do it, but suggested it not be for a few months after radiation as it would cause the whole thing to light up with suspicious spots. I so don't want that so I'm content to wait. I go back in 2 months to see him. Then I met with the RAD ONC. He was a nice man but not like my ONC. =( It made me a little sad being passed onto the next Dr. I had to explain EVERYTHING again...the last 6 months. It was a little sobering b/c most of the time I don't think about it. My appointment went well though and the staff is nice. I go in next Tuesday for my simulation and should start the next week. I have to have 33 treatments. I'm moving closer to the hospital for that time so I don't have to drive so far. I was excited b/c they have lots of gyms and pools in the area which we don't have where I live. Then the RAD ONC said..no pools! booo! He said the chlorine would burn my sensitive skin. Anyways...it was a long day. I didn't get home until 8 pm. But then my mom and I walked 2 miles. Maria I'm starting to feel the chemo legs! They are soooo sluggish. And I think I'm more fatigued now than ever before. I took 3 naps yesterday during all of our time in the car. I just couldn't stay awake.  And I think it is perfectly normal to be emotional. I go to bed every night and prepare to roll up all my bandages, do my LE massage and then re-wrap. Sometimes I cry all the way through it. It's just not how I envisioned the rest of my life... Well I'm off to try to work some today. It's really hard to stay focused these days but doing my best. I hope everyone has a wonderful National BFF day! ",

I like thunderstorms except our neighbor had a tree fall and hit part of their house. It seemed to be ok, but we've got some pretty large pine trees in our back yard. It makes it a bit scary at times. I'm feeling pretty good. I've been exercising pretty consistently for the past week. Except I took the day off yesterday. I'm reallllly sore. And I really don't feel like I've been doing too much, but I guess it's just more than I'm used to. I'm excited that I'm on my way in getting back in shape!  Maria- I meet with the new PT on Tuesday and I can't wait! My arm is pretty manageable right now but I just want it back to normal or as close as possible. When I don't have my wrap on, and use my hand as I normally would, it just feels swollen. Even if it's not noticeable. So I'm getting excited! It's a lot of hassle for all of these appointments but hopefully well worth it. I used to LOVE protien shakes. In college I drank them a lot b/c I really didn't like to cook meat. So my roommate and I drank those a few times a week instead of cooking. Buuuut they were soy. Hmmmm? I really haven't been able to find one that's not soy or full of sugar, but then again, I haven't been looking very hard.  I made it two miles on the treadmill tonight! I didn't go outside b/c it was so hot and I didn't want my arm to swell up. I hope we at least have some mildness in weather this summer. I would like to go outside and enjoy myself at some point. Welcome to the group Julie and Shannon! ",

Marie- I can't offer any advice on the MX front as I had a lumpectomy, but I hope it goes really well for you! These women here are superheros when it comes to foobs and all that it entails! =) Do you have to have nodes removed as well? Whew..I really enjoyed what everyone has posted today..I'm not sure I can remember it all. All I know is that I should probably go get a new bra(s) as well. Sports and regulars. I bought really supportive under armour sports bras after surgery so I could run and not be in pain. But now I think they're too tight and may be causing lymphedema in my back. blahhhhhhh! This blasted swelling is such a pain! So I've also learned that underwire may not be good for me. That's all I have! geeeeehs. Now I have to go buy new bras. I like the ones I have!   Annnnyways. I had rads #2 today. I promise I won't countdown every single day for the next 6 weeks. haha. It went well. When I asked the tech to point out the exact place the radiation was hitting my back so I would know where to put the cream, he said I didn't need cream yet. Only when I started to get red. He said using cream now might put off the burn for a few days, but I would get it anyways so it didn't matter if I used it now. Um, hello? I think I'll take a few extra days and treat my skin now. Geeeesh. I just don't understand people's comments sometimes. I like my skin, thank you, and I'm going to do everything I can to protect it.  But before rads, I got up and went on a walk first thing this morning. Then after rads I went to PT for my LE and then saw the physical therapist and she did a bunch of resistance and stretching exercises with me. THEN, I came home and my friend came over for a bit. She said she was going to zumba so I went with her. I'm not going to be able to walk tomorrow!!!!!! It felt great though. I hadn't done zumba in a few years. So I got my exercise in for today. I hope I didn't overdo it with my arm, but we shall see. It doesn't feel bad at all right now.  Maybe it was good for it.  So, all in all, it was a pretty good day. I'll take it! ",

Well not really forever, but I got out about 45 minutes later than I really should have. I think I'm starting to get tired..I'm not sure if it's from the rads or just from all of the driving to/from appoinments. I actually took a nap today for about 1.5 hours. I never nap either b/c I get impatient waiting to fall asleep. But it was really nice b/c I fell asleep right away. I could nap everyday if that was the case.  More of the same for me tomorrow.

I'm sure you are stressed to the max though. Be sure and take some me time for yourself to clear your head. I want to come visit Chicago when you're all settled. Actually I have a friend who wants to go to Chicago as my celebratory trip for being done with treatment. Maybe if you're settled we can swing by! I'm not sure if/when we're going yet but I'll keep you updated. I have an aunt that used to live in Naperville. I've been there a couple of times and it was really nice. I was young though so I can't remember too much. Renn- yay for a successful surgery! I hope you're feeling good today and that drain isn't causing you too much pain.

I'm trying to let myself relax and take naps when needed but sometime I just feel like I need to get things done. =/ I met with my RO on Tuesday and he just about made me cry. Not b/c he was nice...but b/c his remarks about my LE not being so bad really upset me. I held it in until I left. I hate for people to see me cry. Sometimes it just comes out of nowhere! Oh, and one of my tattoos seems to have disappeared. It's so strange. They put one on my nipple and we can't find it anymore...lol. Oh well..they have 4 others to go off from.  Sue-enjoy the rest of your trip! Marie- glad you're feeling a little better.  Yay for clean margins and clear path results! Shannon- enjoy your trip! A cabin in the woods sounds soooo relaxing! Let us know how it goes. Well I'm officially 1/3 of the way done with rads. I've had 13/33 treatments done! I'm just a little pink. As I was saying earlier, my RO made me cry on Tuesday. He was examining my hands and looking at my LE hand and he was trying to mumble his way through telling me it didn't look that bad. He said it's really very mild and that cosmetically didn't really look much different than the other hand and if he were not a medical professional then he would have no idea. I looked him straight in the eye and said, \"my top concern is not how it looks, it's how it feels, and how I can no longer do many things like I used to.\" He said..like what? So I said...brushing my teeth, putting makeup on, writing and typing are difficult...and then I drew a blank although I know there are many more. He said..obviously it is affecting you more on the inside than on the outside... haha..I don't know. I think he was trying to sympathize with me in some weird way but it just really upset me. At one point he was like, is there anything that we can do more that we're not doing? I said...I have no idea. I just wanted out of there. It's just so upsetting that they have no clue about treatments for such a common condition probably concerning many of their patients.  Other than that horrible conversation, I've had a pretty good week. I've just been trying to work and sleep. =) Oh, and eat. It seems like that's all I have time for and the next thing I know it's time for bed. Whew, radiation is a little exhausting having to go everyday. I'm going to a family reunion this weekend. I'm excited to see all of my family until I remember how different I look. I just want to be normal for a day without all of the questions on how I'm doing, what's rads like...etc, etc. But I will definately have a good time at my grandmas. She's the best! Ok, that's all for now. I have a friend coming later. I think we should go do a little shopping and eating to make me feel better. Have a great day all!",
