    "Content": "mommck3 wrote: hi- hoping someone might have advice on what I should push for next. I\u2019m 42 and just finished a summer of DMX and 4 cycles of TC chemo. I had stage 2A IDC grade 3, onco 17,and extensive LVI (lymphovascular invasion). I\u2019m now heading into hormone therapy stage with Lupron shots and AI drugs. I went to a naturopathic oncologist to determine how to supplement my treatment naturally. He ran a test to determine if I still had breast cancer cells in my blood. Well, I do, it\u2019s a low rate of them but they are there. I\u2019m wondering if this means I should have done more chemo? Or should I be looking into ways to \u201cclean\u201d my blood? I have no idea but grade 3 means they grow aggressively so I\u2019m trying to get ahead of developing further. Also does this put me in stage 4 versus 2A? Thank you!! Log in to post a reply",
