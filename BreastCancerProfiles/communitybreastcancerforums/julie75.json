I have the IVS2+1G>A gene mutation. I had a BMX in 2010 and had SO HOPED to be past worrying about any type of cancer. My oncologist just gave me permission to see her once/year. Oh, well. Such things happen. Does anyone know how much the risk of ovarian cancer is increased with this mutation? I thought I read the possibility of low-grade ovarian cancer was increased, but not higher grades. Also, from what I read, my risk of colon cancer has increased, but I believe colon cancer develops more slowly. I'm not terribly worried about that portion of it. My colonoscopy 7 years ago came back clean. I'll be scheduling another colonoscopy within the next few weeks. Just as an FYI, my sister had breast cancer, and she had a lumpectomy several years ago. My brother had colon cancer roughly 20 years ago, and has been cancer-free since then. I'm considering a prophylactic removal of my ovaries. From what I've read, ovarian cancer is sneaky and, being the worrier that I am, removing them might be the way to go. Thoughts? Thanks for reading this--any advice is appreciated. Julie      ",

Regarding taking all lymph nodes, I believe doctors here perform a \"sentinel lymph node biopsy\" here in the U.S. before deciding to remove any lymph nodes. Here is more information on the sentinel lymph node biopsy: http://www.uihealthcare.com/topics/medicaldepartments/cancercenter/sentinelnodebiopsy/index.html As to going back to work, I've heard of people taking only two weeks after a mastectomy, then going back to work. It just depends on how well you heal. Regarding immediate construction, this is a procedure whereby they can place tissue expanders under your chest muscles and fill them with saline. I had this procedure done when I had my bilateral mastectomy, which was on 09/17/10; in my case, the procedure is referred to as a \"skin-sparing mastectomy\". They were able to save my right nipple. When I woke up, I had breasts roughly the same size as I had before. I wanted to go up a cup size, so the tissue expanders were inflated over several two-week intervals. I just had my replacement surgery with silicone implants on 01/24/11. I did have several complications; the tissue expander on my left side was leaking, so they had to replace that. Also, I had some necrosis on my left side; that had to be removed. Due to these complications, I was off work for about 6 months, but many people go back to work between operations (it took me about 1 week to recover from each surgery). I'll be getting my left nipple reconstructed, along with some tatooing to reconstruct the left aureola. I'm not sure why your doctor is telling you \"two years\". That seems a bit long to me, unless you want to take time off between the different phases of reconstruction. I know women who have waited several months, to several years, before undergoing reconstruction. I understand completely your resignation and anger; I feel the same way at times. But, the scars will fade; mine are looking better every day. Again, this is just my experience . . . I think there are several other bc.org threads that have dealt with mastectomies scheduled in previous months. You may want to check those out. Best of luck to you, and everyone else undergoing this.

Once the implants have been placed, ask your PS how soon you can start using silicone strips (or something else) to treat them.  (My PS told me to wait 3 months after my implants were placed before treating my scars.) For those who may have nausea issues from the anesthesia - there is an anti-nausea drug, called \"Zophran\", that can be added to the  anesthesia.  This drug helped me. carylc:  Hope you are doing okay.   RedSkyAtNight:  Thinking of you today.   Again, if any of you have questions, don't hesitate to PM me.

Drain fluid can go back into one's self, but as Janet indicated, the fluid will drain back out again. As to feeling weepy, well, that happens after going through all of this. The entire process - from initial diagnosis through surgery and then on to aftercare - is so very stressful that I found myself crying frequently and with no apparent reason. And, I know I'm going to continue to cry at times because of all of this. I go back to work tomorrow for the first time after surgery, and I'm sure I'll need some private time there to cry as well. RussanPostman: Good luck tomorrow with your surgery. Kezzie, SweetJolie and brca1953:  Good luck with your surgery this week. Julie",

In September, 2008, my mammogram showed calcifications in my left breast.  Needless to say, this threw me and my husband into a major worry spin, which was made worse by having to wait one month before a sonoscan could be performed.  The sonoscan results at that time indicated that the calcifications were not malignent.  My 2009 mammogram didn't show any changes.   In August, 2010, I felt a hard spot in my left breast, and immediately contacted my General Practitioner (GP).  She ordered a sonoscan for me.  The radiologist looked the sonoscan over, and scheduled a stereotatic biopsy, which then indicated that I had DCIS Stage 0 in my left breast.   Since I didn't want to go through more worry, I decided to have a BMX, even though my right breast didn't have any indication of cancer.  On 09/17/10, I had this surgery, complete with reconstruction.  The good news was the tumor (7 cm x 4.5 cm x 2 cm) had not spread to the surrounding tissue.  Therefore, I am blessed with not having to do chemo, radiation or drugs like Tamoxifen. On 10/17, I had a second operation to excise necrosis on my left breast. Once that healed, I received fills every two weeks until 12/6, when my PS discovered that the TE under my left breast was leaking; I had that replaced then. On 12/27/10, I had a colonoscopy, which came back normal - more good news. Today is 12/30/10, and I am counting my blessings again.  I am enjoying breasts that are finally balanced with my hips (my breasts were always about 1.5 inches smaller than my hips) and have decided to treat myself to liposuction of my thights and butt as my way of enjoying life.   Strength to all of you going through this.  My faith in God has gotten me through this; my DH has been my backbone, as well as my family and friends.   As mjbmiller indicated, do as much research as possible.  I spent countless hours on the Internet, surfing for all information I could possibly get my hands on.  Talking to friends and family always helps - you'll need a support system.   And, allow yourself to cry and get those bad feelings out.  I was so drained after talking to doctors that I would take the rest of the day off of work.  Due to my complications, I won't be returning to work until the implants are placed.  Please take as much time as you need to heal - emotionally and physically. {{{HUGS}}} Julie",
