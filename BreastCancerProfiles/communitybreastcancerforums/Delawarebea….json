Everything has gone well up till yesterday. I had an allergic reaction to the taxotere. It happened in a matter of seconds. I started to see little spots before my eyes. Then my chest tightened and I tried to cough and by that time I couldn't breath at all. That God my friend was with me. She ran and got the nurse. They turned off the taxotere drip and I started to feel better almost immediatly. My blood pressure had jumped to 149/90. It's normally 110/65. I felt like my skin was going to catch fire. I only have one more treatment, so I'm going to have them watch me very closely. I was frightened beyong belief. I have great nurses. They were very comforting.",
