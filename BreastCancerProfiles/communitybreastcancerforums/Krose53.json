It a rare autoimmune disease that causes my adrenal glands to be completely non functional. I produce no cortisol on my own. I replace it everyday with 20-30mg hydrocortisone a day. My Endo said I\u2019d do \u201cjust fine\u201d during chemo. No advice , no guidelines, no idea when to increase meds. Things really feel apart days 6 and 7. I had no idea what was expected from chemo versus low cortisol. Luckily I had an injection kit for emergencies and injected and by Monday am was feeling so much better. Wondering if anyone on TC chemo could tell me some symptoms you had and what days were the worst. Tips? Any info would be so appreciated! Thank you. This a a great group. Invaluable",

I has hospitalized for 3 days on days 8,9 and 10. I still feel incredibly tired and weak. My flu symptoms are almost gone. I start Chemo round 3 on Monday the 5th. Anyone else going through this? Last time I felt great after Day 9. I'm nervous that chemo is coming up so soon. Any ideas to improve my energy before round 3. I'm pretty tired after climbing a flight of stairs.",

I didn\u2019t fell like I had an increased temp at all. It was 101. Instructed to go to ER. I was diagnosed with Influenza A and put on antibiotics, Tamaflu. They kept me 2 nights. I had chest X-ray in hospital and they thought I could possibly have the beginnning of pneumonia but probably not. They did antibiotics anyway. I hope everything turns out to be fine.",
