Unfortunately the \"tumor board\" in my area feels that we should go in anyway to \"clean it up\". I think it's better to be safe than sorry, but was wondering if anyone out there has had two surgeries in the same breast. I am wondering about scaring. Will it be worse?

I went in for my pre-op appointment with my surgeon and was happy that I wasn't surprised with her response. I already knew the answer to my question. Thanks for that. It's nice to NOT be surprised sometimes. It feels okay, but hope that it heals as quickly this time. I had my chemo vap (I've decided to call it my cleansing vap) put in on the other side while I was under for the clear margins and that is bothering me more than the lumpectomy scar. I agree with you D1, that it's harder to rebound from the subsequent surgeries. I will be starting chemo at the beginning of Dec. and rads and hormone therapy too. Hang in there, ladies. Off to get some ice! Jax",

I do have a great support system, however, none of them have had bc before.  Lumpectomy for ibc on left breast. Had clear margins and no nodes! Yea! I will for sure have rads, but am meeting with a medical oncolgist first to find out what he suggests about chemo. Ug! I thought it was no nodes = no chemo.  I am still waiting to hear that... My crying has subsided, but just pops up randomly throughout the day. Sometimes it's because I am so grateful that we caught it as early as we did. Sometimes I feel scared. Sometimes I just want to cry. Ha! I'm crying now just thinking about how nice you two were to respond to my plea. Prayer, meditation and positive thinking have helped tremendously. I'll be thinking of you, Helen, on Monday. Maybe I won't have to have chemo and will start the rads process in a few weeks with you, Terry. Fondly, Jacqie",
