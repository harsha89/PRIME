Bought new bras thought well maybe it's the mirena iud but then found a lump 2 1/2 months ago, and the pain has gradually intensified. Was seen by OBGYN and she confirmed she felt the lump. Went for mammogram and ultrasound and they could only see dense tissue. Doctor said come back if there are any changes. 2 months later and pain is worse and lump has doubled in size, and now my nipple looks different - like it's pushed out by the lump near it (it's just left of). ObGYn orders me back to breast clinic for another ultrasound with biopsy. This time they see cysts and very Dense enlarged tissue. No biggie dr says, you're fine. I ask about biopsy and he says there's nothing to biopsy I feel frustrated. Do they not biopsy cysts? Why is it continuing to grow and the pain intensifying? He gave me no suggestions. Comeback in a year. It's prob just hormones or stress. This doesn't change with my cycle. I'm so baffled. Any advice would be much appreciated. Log in to post a reply",
