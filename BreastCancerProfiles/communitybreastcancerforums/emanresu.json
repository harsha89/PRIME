      "Content": "Jan 26, 2009 04:32PM emanresu wrote: The following guidelines by the AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY is why I have been refused a MRI for two years in a row. I had to appeal BLUECROSS AND BLUESHIELD twice to get an MRI. I had to appear before a panel of six people and give all of my evidence to them. It was very very  very hard to have to go over my entire history. Breast cancer, 1991 and 2003. Lumpectomy, chemo, radiation. They told me that BCBS insurance used the AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY GUIDELINE to determine IF I AM ELIGIBLE FOR AN MRI.  So now the ACS is telling me if I CAN HAVE AN MRI. Neither of the breast cancers were found on mammo's. One not on ultrasound. The American Cancer Society considers NOT a high risk candidate for MRI. So therefore I NO LONGER give any credibility to the American Cancer Society. Please see below. MG  AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY:Breast cancer MRI scans are more sensitive than mammograms, but they are also more likely to show spots in the breast that may or may not be cancer. Often there is no way of knowing whether or not these spots are cancerous short of a follow-up biopsy or some other invasive procedure. That is why the test is not recommended for women with an average risk of breast cancer, the guideline says. \"As with other cancer screening tests, MRI is not perfect and in fact leads to many more false-positive results than mammography,\" explains Christy Russell, MD, chair of the ACS Breast Cancer Advisory Group and co-author of the new guideline. \"Those false-positives, which can lead to a high number of avoidable biopsies, can create fear, anxiety, and adverse health effects, making it imperative to carefully select those women who should be screened using this technology.\" For women at average risk, ACS recommends getting annual mammograms and breast exams by a physician, beginning at age 40. Most high-risk women should begin getting MRIs and mammograms at age 30, the new guideline says, unless they and their doctor think it's better to begin at a different age. Better Evidence for Many Situations The new guideline is published in the latest issue of the ACS journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians. It recommends MRI screening in addition to mammograms for women who meet at least one of the following conditions: The recommendations are based on studies that were published after the ACS last revised its breast cancer early detection guidelines in 2002-2003. At that time, the panel concluded there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against MRI in high-risk women, so the guideline advised these women to make the decision after talking with their doctor. Now there is more solid evidence that MRI is useful for certain women. \"These guidelines are a critical step to help define who should be screened using MRI in addition to mammography, a question of significant importance as we discover women at very high risk of breast cancer can be diagnosed much earlier when combining the two technologies rather than using mammography alone,\" says Russell, co-director of the University of Southern California/Norris Cancer Hospital Lee Breast Center. More to Be Learned for Other High-Risk Situations For some women, however, the jury is still out on whether MRI screening is beneficial, even though they have conditions that do give them a higher-than-average risk of breast cancer. The guideline says there still isn't enough evidence to recommend for or against MRI screening in women who: Screening MRIs are not recommended for women with a lifetime risk of breast cancer below 15%. MRI Also Useful in Contralateral Diagnosis Although the ACS guidelines find screening MRIs of uncertain value for breast cancer survivors, a newly published study shows the scans can be useful for finding tumors in the opposite (contralateral) breast of women newly diagnosed with the disease. As many as 10% of women with breast cancer develop a new tumor in the opposite breast, even though nothing is found when they are checked with mammograms and physical exams at the time of their original diagnosis. Finding these cancers earlier could help women make treatment decisions (some women with cancer in just one breast opt to have both breasts removed as a precaution), and might spare them from extra rounds of surgery and chemotherapy later.",
