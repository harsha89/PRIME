I convinced myself it's nothing and if it is you will eventually notice. About six months ago that area seems to change quickly. It feels thick and my breast actually feels \"heavier\". It's very noticeable to me. I finally got up the nerve to go to the doctor. I was seen today. He basically said what I'm feeling/he is feeling is thickening. And may be nothing but can also be a cause for concern (I feel NO LESS at ease leaving as I did going there!). And he is sending me for a mammo & Ultrasound ASAP. They were on the phone trying to schedule it for this week as I was leaving. I don't know what to think... Log in to post a reply",

He referred me for a diagnostic mammo and US...which I had today. The radiologist did multiple enhanced views and then I went in for my ultrasound. The tech scanned me for quite some time and I had a feeling shekels seeing something because she was marking basically the \"coordinates\" for the area. The radiologist came in and scanned me then. When he was done he basically told me that my symptoms were presenting as ILC and there was an area he was seeing on urasound...which did not show up on my mammo...that was suspicious for ILC. He actually showed mE IT on ultrasound and it is more of a line that he found. He scheduled me for a core biopsy on Monday. He gave me a BIRAD of 4. Any advice would be appreciate! Extremely worried!

The doctor did say my left breast is also dense. There is also a family history of breast cancer...two aunts and two first cousins...and all were BRCA positive. I definitely am trying to keep my head clear and stay positive but I'm seriously worried.",
