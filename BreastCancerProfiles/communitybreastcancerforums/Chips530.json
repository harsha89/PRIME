I am a recovering Alcoholic(22 years),so I know how important a belief in a \"higher power\" & a good support system can be.It's amazing how much love & concern I have gotten from friends that I have shared with for they ALL understand what pain & anxiety & fear of the unknown feels like. I have had a Lumpectomy & the 2 wks, later,an ex-cision,now will start radiation I have found that the more knowledge I get about my disease,the more power I feel I have. I am very respectful of privacy,so if anyone wants to contact me with \"private message\" that is fine.We can all get through this together !!!",
