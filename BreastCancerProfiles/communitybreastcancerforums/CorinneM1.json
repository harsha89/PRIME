      "Content": "Jan 8, 2012 06:46AM - edited Jan 8, 2012 06:51AM by CorinneM1 I got my news over the phone as well.  I was ready though with a list of questions in case the news was cancer.  I think it was better to prepare for the worst news, hope for the best. I asked what grade I was. What type it was, if it was hormone postive, HER negative or positive and what my next steps were.  Granted, I knew nothing about grade, hormones or HER, but I read that you should ask these questions and I did. Once I got the information I spent few days researching what I could before I met with my breast surgeon who was able to give me more details. Have these questions at the ready in case the news isn't what you hoped for. And oh yeah, this is one of the worst parts. The waiting.  Even if the news isn't good, you can start to put together a plan on what's next.  This is what messed with my head the most. The not knowing and not knowing what to do next.  Once all of the pieces came together--it was something like this Okay I have cancer...what next...BMX...what next...decide on course of follow up treatment...what next...begin treatment...what next...live your life and overcome.",

I am recovering well, minimal pain just the tightness and akward feeling of TE.  I am awaiting to find out what my follow up treatment will be as the Onctotype was sent out and I don't have the reports yet.  I may have to do radiation due to a close margin, which will also be determined early next week. Nice to meet you all.",

I am 40. Everyone's recovery is different.  I was back to work within 2 weeks, and was fine physically and mentally.  I haven't had any issues or horror stories with Tamoxifen either. Is this what your breast surgeron is stating--either/or mastectomy or tamoxifen as a preventative? You are young. Do you have kids or do you plan on having any children?  Pregnancy and tamoxifen is a no-no.",
