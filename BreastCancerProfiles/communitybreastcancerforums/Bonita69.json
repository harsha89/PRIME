My Sister at age 34 also had breast cancer IDC Stage 0 as well as my 3 maternal Aunts.Same type as well but one had stage 3, All survived. I opted to do the DNA test to see if in fact we have the BRCA mutation in our family. For I have a 17 yr old daughter I hope and pray she NEVER HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS EVER!!!!!!!! Because of my strong family history I opted to do Mast. on both breast as well full hysterectomy. Same as my sister chose. My Dr. is still testing my biopsy to see what they are going to respond to and Chemo I'm not out of the woods on that yet. What kind of use will I have with my arms? How long? Plan is Simple total mastectomy First week in Feb 2009 if any cancer is found in nodes during surgery then Dr. said I will get modified radical mastectomy and chemo is 100% in my recovery plans. How is this going to affect my sex life will I be interested?? Chemo/hysterectomy Ya know after I heal and all? Since I don't know what menopause is like what is it like in that area? My man is so sexy and just could not imagine not being interested in him in that way....that bothers me a lot among other things all mushed up in my head right now.... Log in to post a reply",
