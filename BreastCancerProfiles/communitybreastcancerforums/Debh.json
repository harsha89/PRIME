Just got scans back and the mets in my liver are the same and the mets in my lungs are smaller. We always pray for smaller or the same. It has been a long time since we have had a nugget of god news so we are thrilled. Unfortunately they found pneumonia and a dilated kidney in the process, but wes are working on all of that. Hopefully we all will do well in the Haalavan Club. How is everyone else doing?",
