      "Content": "yellowcat wrote: Hello, I am new to the forum. I have had a lumpectomy with a few complications while healing. I have good margins, I have low grade invasive ductal carcinoma. But since the lumpectomy I have had a hematoma under the incision that is about 2 inches long. It is finally decreasing in size. At week two I started losing mobility in my arm -- couldn't put it straight up or straight out to the side. I had trouble reaching things far away from me. I seeing a physical therapist twice and am gaining mobility. Along with that came cording under my arm. The most painful thing was the nerve pain from my elbow, up under my arm and then down my torso to my breast. It feels like I have blisters. It feels raw. I'm told it is nerve pain from the lymph gland removal and usually goes away. I'm a walker and I walk with my hand on my hip and my arm out to avoid the pain. I think it is finally improving - probably from the physical therapy also. Then tonight I have an itching red rash on the healing breast; not on the incision, just on the breast. I'm not sure what that is. I have met with the radiation oncologist and I've now moved my appointment for the \"set up\" two times. I can't bear to think of radiation and further limiting my arm both in nerve pain and movement. This week I sent my pathology to Dr. Lagios for a second opinion. I have a second opinion coming up for a radiology oncologist next Friday. My first radiation oncologist said my chances of recurrence without radiation are 30%. As far as I can tell that is for all lumpectomies, not for grade 1 with good margins, etc - in other works that recurrence rate is not personalized. He also told me he would give me 20 sessions of radiation. I have a friend with similar cancer that had 16 sessions. When I asked him by email if I was a possiblity for 16 he agreed to that being a possibility. My concern is he is over-treating me. THus the second opinion. Then I read studies where women at 70 with low grade invasive ductal carcinoma do not get much \"bang for the buck\" for radiation. The course of treatment suggested for certain women is no radiationa followed by hormonal therapy. I don't want hormonal therapy either. But at least one can quit that if it gives you trouble. I'm wondering if that would be a better route for me. At this point, I feel like radiation is risky for me. If that nerve pain continues, it would certainly affect the quality of my life. Have some of you had nerve pain and arm mobility issues before radiation and then been successful with radiation?
