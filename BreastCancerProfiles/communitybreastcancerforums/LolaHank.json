NEVER thought this would happen again, absolutely no signs. No pain at all. Found at a yearly check up with oncologist. Pretty pissed off at the whole drug world as my onco wanted to start chemo immediately. I didn't even have another port yet. Only 1 arm can be used due to lymphedema. Got 2nd opinion at MD Anderson and started femara for 3 months. Will get results this week to see what is next. So happy to see ladies on here who are so uplifting and compassionate. You all are a rare breed! Pleasure to meet yall!",

They say the drug has to come from the Specialty Pharmacy owned by Humana. I applied for the Pfizer copay one card and what Humana doesn't pay, the pfizer card will pay. I pay a total of 10.00 each script. They will send it to me each month via UPS. I get it tomorrow. Very excited but fearful. Keeping my fingers crossed that side effects aren't bad. Keeping the faith!  *Cost of the Ibrance for me on Humana is 10,361.20, copay is 2,590.30. The pfizer card limit is 25,000. So this will get me 9 months. Hmm, feeling fortunate to be able to use the drug but we all need to be millionaires to live. ",
