This is what the report says, Immunohistochemistry has been performed and this shows that the tumor is entirely negative for the oestrogen receptor antibody as well as the progesterone receptor antibody and shows strong (3+) positive straining for c-erb-b2 (HER-2). A characteristic membranous pattern of \"inverted\" straining for EMA is seen, the pattern typically associated with micropapillary carcinoma. An isolated cluster of tumor cells does appear to be within lymphatic channels (as delineated by cd31/cd34) but most of the papillary clusters are seen within retracted from the stroma as is typical for this lesion. The Ki67 proliferation index is approximately 30% If anyone can help me make some sense of this it would be greatly appreciated. I'm having my lymph node biopsy'ed tomorrow and then all the reat of the scans on thursday to complete staging. I haven't cried yet, I'm still in shock. ",

I've got a 9 week old baby and had a small lump in my boob appear about a month before he was due, once my milk came in and went down the lump was much larger, it wasn't sore though. I went to the Dr's and she thought it was mastitis and put me on antibiotics, She asked if I had a fever, I didn't. The day after I started taking the antibiotics my boob started to hurt, I went back to the Dr's after a week and said I thought the lump which pretty much takes up my whole boob had gone down a little bit, The Dr disagreed with me and sent me for an ultrasound.  Ultrasound tech said most probably mastitis, went back to Dr's and she wasn't happy with that and sent me for a mammogram, mammogram showed that my right breast was denser but nothing else, also suggested mastitis. Dr wasn't happy with that so sent me to a breast specialist, went and saw her and she organised a core Biosy for me ASAP the next morning.  She didn't really give me any indication of what she thought, she just said obviously something is going on and we need to find out what it is. I'm thinking the worst obviously and think it's cancer, It's Saturday night now and i'm seeing her on Tuesday at 12pm. I'm only 34 and I'm pretty healthy, I just can't get my head around this, I don't want to leave my 3 children.

There was a 3cm lump but only the centre was IDC 1.5cm the rest was DCIS. And lymph nodes were negative! No cancer cells found. And it was grade 1 not grade 2 like the biopsy said. That's quite strange isn't it! So that means no chemotherapy and no radiotherapy! I'm so grateful and relieved.  ",

I will have another MRI after the next 2 Taxotere's and Herceptin and then surgery, we haven't talked about what will happen at surgery yet.  I had 2 positive nodes at the time of diagnosis which was confirmed with a biopsy, all my other scans were clear though.",
