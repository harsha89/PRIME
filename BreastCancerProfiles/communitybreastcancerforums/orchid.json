What seems to stop me in my tracks is the sadness.  I am fifty, and do not fear death itself.  But I have two teenage daughters, and the thought of not seeing them graduate from high school and college, get married, see their children being born -- that brings tears to my eyes whenever I think of it.  I have been married to a wonderful man for almost 22 years (anniversary is coming up next month), we have a good marriage and I'd hoped to grow old with him.  It occurred to me as we were lying in bed tonight (am up on the internet because of intermittent insomnia) that I will be lucky indeed if I make it to our 30th anniversary, let alone any milestone later than that. I know that there is no way to know how long I as an individual will last, and I am doing my best to give myself the best chances of survival (eating healthfully, exercise, drinking green tea, etc.).  And I also know that having a positive attitude is probably healthier than a melancholy one.  But I still get stuck on the sadness sometimes, and just don't know how to deal with this sword of Damocles that is hanging by a hair above all of us with stage IV mets.  Its the weirdest, hardest thing to be mourning for yourself and your future when you're still here... I like Fitstwins idea about not feeling sorry for yourself for more than 24 hours -- or maybe the flip side of that -- ALLOWING yourself to feel sorry for yourself for 24 hours, but then trying to move on.  I guess part of moving on is learning to accept that sadness is part of the package.  Sigh. Hugs to all. Orchid",

      "Content": "orchid wrote: Nine months after my dx of bone mets, and after the recent failure of Femara, I am now more than a month into my new regimen on Xeloda. For those of you who don't already know about Xeloda, its an oral form of chemotherapy that I take as pills. While I have never been on chemo before and was scared to make the leap to it, this is one of the least harsh forms of chemo. Fortunately it is easy to take at home, and although it may cause my hair to thin a bit, I am hopeful it will not fall out. Each cycle is 21 days: for 14 days I take the meds morning and evening (2500mg total), followed by a 7 day \"rest\" period during which the body can recuperate. I am now mid way through the second cycle, and I seem to be tolerating the drug reasonably well. I have some side effects including minor pain in my hands and feet, but on the medium-level dosage I'm taking I seem to have avoided the more horrible versions of what can happen (and which I know many on this list have experienced), and some of the worst side effects have so far not materialized. I still have some bone pain, but since my change in meds the ongoing headaches I was having are considerably diminished, which is a relief. The main side effect that I now have from the chemo is fatigue. I am trying to get exercise every day, but the fatigue can make doing this difficult. I never realized how much energy I used to have till it was compromised. I have an appointment to start acupuncture this week, and I have also been seeing a mind/body practitioner, all of which I hope will help me stay as well as possible. At the end of the third cycle of chemo, we will do scans again to see how I'm doing. Physically and emotionally I still have good days and bad days. I admit that I can be a terrible patient and on bad days I complain a lot. My husband is a saint for tolerantly listening to my grumbling, but I am grateful for this as his sympathy and sharing my discomfort seems to make it more bearable and help the bad moments pass more quickly. Those of my friends who have had the misfortune of calling to inquire how I'm doing on a bad day probably got an earful from me, and I needed to tell them afterward that I'm not always so down and grumpy. I am all the more grateful for the good days when I have them, and I try to make the most of them. Living With Cancer I have written here before that while I understand that some people find it helpful and motivating, I find that I bristle at the war metaphors we commonly hear about \"fighting\" and \"battling\" this disease. Cancer is simply part of the universe, like earthquakes or tsunamis. Being caught in the vortex of any of these phenomena, including cancer, is tragic (especially when its YOU that is caught in this vortex!). Yet we own cancer -- it is not an outside invader. Cancer is our very own cells and DNA, just our own cells gone awry. For me it just feels too negative to make war on my own wayward cells. Instead I need to embrace them, and find a way to heal them. In place of the war imagery, in my quiet moments I beseech my cancer cells to transform into normal healthy cells, and to join the unity of the rest of our organism. I tell them that if they continue as they are we will all surely die, sooner rather than later. If I must have a metaphor, its that I want to sing my cancer cells to sleep, not kill them like a valkyrie descending on the battlefield to the accompaniment of Wagnererian music. I have written here in part before, that with each new diagnosis and its escalating treatment, I sometimes feel that having this disease is like dying very slowly. First you lose a body part, then one piece of your quality of life goes out the window, then another. Then I realized that everyone on the planet is, in fact, dying slowly. We stage IV cancer patients are simply forced to face our own mortality in a more conscious way, perhaps sooner than some others. There are times when this makes me overwhelmingly sad, and I find that there is a grieving process that is part of dealing with this illness. Like anyone else, I want to watch my daughter's lives unfold, to grow old with my husband, and to be there to witness my family and friends' milestones. I am hopeful that I will be around for a good long while, and I'm doing everything in my power to make that happen. Yet I am keenly aware that we get no guarantees in this life. In an odd way, this awareness the cancer has brought me makes the good moments, like when I'm feeling well and I take the dogs for a walk in the cool of a summer evening, or I hear my daughters laughing together in the next room, or I feel the touch of my husband's hand on my shoulder, those moments become all the more precious and joyful. Although I don't always succeed, I am doing my best to try to hold onto that. Sending you all light and love, Orchid Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "May 23, 2010 11:53PM orchid wrote: A month after my diagnosis of bone mets I asked my onc for antidepressants.  I was crying every day and didn't want to live that way.  I asked for (and she gave me) Wellbutrin.  Prior to the mets dx I'd been on tamoxifen for 5 years, and it had completely destroyed my sexual response.  I had done some research and knew that Wellbutrin could have some positive effect on the sexual response issues, so I specifically asked for that.  Since my first diagnosis of stage 1 cancer back in 2004 I have had a prescription for Ativan, an anti-anxiety med.  I find my worst moments are often after 10 pm (my husband refers to this as my \"morose hour\").  The Ativan is good at bedtime, and helps me get to sleep on those nights when my mind runs wild and I can't turn off the scary stuff. A shrink I'd been seeing asked me whether the Wellbutrin had improved things, and I answered it was hard to tell because I started taking it at a time when I was in crisis mode.  Now that I am 7 months into the bone mets dx, I am still trying to come to terms with what living with this is supposed to mean.  I have good days and bad days, but there are few days when at some point during the day the whole experience of having mets doesn't weigh on me and make me sad.  I'm coming to realize that (for me at least) this just comes with the territory.  People keep telling me, \"Gee, you look great!\" which is nice to hear, but they don't see me on bad days because I don't go out when I feel lousy.  And I also keep hearing about how much people say they admire my strength and courage, and again, while I appreciate that, they don't see me when I'm bawling my head off behind closed doors.   I wonder how much the fact that I have had an instant chemical menopause has a role in the sadness (they put me on Lupron when I was first dx'ed to shut down my ovaries, in order to be able to give me Femara).  At 50 I wasn't that far from menopause in any case, but the fact at having it come on suddenly and abruptly has been rough at times. Right now I find everything is more intense.  The good times, and the bad times.  I am trying to keep in mind Pema Chodron's advice (she is an American woman who became a Buddhist nun, and who has written some great books).  She talks a lot about how change is constant and the sooner we stop trying to hold onto things and just relax with the idea that there is nothing to hold onto (that is probably not a great articulation of her ideas, but the best I can do at the moment), the sooner we will be able to understand and accept life's uncertainties.   Till I get that far I will continue to take the Wellbutrin.  One positive thing about being off the Tamoxifen is that my sexual response has come back somewhat.  Whereas it is not what it used to be, since it was down to zero I find this to be a great improvement. Ask your onc for those meds, there is nothing noble in suffering for suffering's sake.",
