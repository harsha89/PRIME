US, mamo, bilateral ductogram, and MRI are all clear. Scheduled for a total bilateral duct incision in a few days. I\u2019m worried about the pain involved with the procedure (I can only take Tylenol) and of course the waiting for and results of the pathology report. I keep thinking how can all these tests could be negative and something still show up, but.... I know it can. Hope everything worked out for you",
