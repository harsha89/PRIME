      "Content": "rnyoung85 wrote: 3 months ago, I began having a strange dull ache in the upper quadrant portion, towards the nipple, of my left breast, say 2 or 3 o'clock. If pressed upon it would hurt, otherwise it was just a dull ache. Persistent through the months and doesn't subside with period. At first, I payed little attention assuming that it was related to my cycle, but it didn't come and go with them. I do not feel a lump, but honestly don't know if I would know a \"lump\" if I felt it as I have Fibrocystic Breast Disease and my breasts always feel \"lumpy\". Began thinking maybe I was having Hypothyroid symptoms (I have Hashimoto's) because I've lost weight (almost 30 lbs., rather quickly, since April and haven't regained it without diet change or heavy exercise (not normal for me with thyroid problem), been incredibly fatigued and overly moody, (not normal at all), I eat fairly well and am relatively active and have noticed that I tire so much easier than even just a few months ago and my hair is noticeably thinning. My labs for thyroid came back perfectly normal and my PCP just said it must be aging (I am almost 31). I crave sugar, like CRAVEEEE it. I could eat cake for dinner and not bat an eye. I have breast milk like drainage from the right breast, but no pain. Its all a little weird. There is no history of breast cancer in my family other than my great maternal grandmother having it. I am sure that it likely is nothing, but I am still somewhat concerned. I try to brush it off due to my age. My nipple, when pressed, is extremely sore. Then, as you radiate towards the areola and the breast itself, the pain lessens. It just doesn't feel \"right\". Have any of you, prior to diagnosis suffered any symptoms such as these, and should I even consider pushing this? Thoughts appreciated. Really confused. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
