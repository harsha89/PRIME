I am currently being treated with pre-surgery chemo to shrink 8cm tumor that ulcerated the skin. I'm constantly inflammed and on and off antibiotics to control that. I'm finishing up A/C chemo tomorrow and onco. wants me to do the Taxol routine after. My surgeon feels comfortable doing masectomy now but will make final decision after PET on Mon. yet onco disagrees and wants to continue to shrink it with the Taxol and feels continuing this treatment will better ensure no recurrence and long term survival, the surgeon disagrees. Shouldn't they agree and stop confusing me, who knows nothing about what the best route to take is? Isn't it better to get the cancer out? The decision in the end is mine to make, I know that and will wait until PET results, but was hoping for some advice. Continue with Taxol, then surgery, yet fear the cancer will spread regardless of treatment or Surgery then radiation? Onco keeps saying once you stop theres no going back? Please help me to understand. Dx 11/21/2009, IDC, 6cm+, Grade 3, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I will have my first PET on the 15th and a follow up ct scan, i guess that will let me know how much of a response. I've been battling an \"infection\" on my breast(from the cancer) since Oct. and throughout my body for a long while that presents it self through my skin. I will weigh all my options but I don't want the anxiety of wanting the cancer OUT to cloud my better judgement if that is to proceed with the Taxol. ",

Now the chemo I will get is Taxotere. Is it common for the nodes NOT to respond to one type of chemo but respond to another, or do i have to keep worrying of further spread? I start the chemo tomorrow, had to start steroids today, but wont see DR. I will ask my nurse administering my IV what she thinks or knows.                                                                     Just would like to know how common this is. PET also showed spot on lung and liver, but am told not to worry since there has been no change either way in 3 months. Dont know about that either!!! Was trying to stay hopeful throughout this, got over the initial terrified part only to now have this news thrown at me. Trying not to get terrified again.

I completed 4 rounds (every 3 weeks) of A/C then did two (every 3 weeks) rounds of taxotere which was extremely hard on me so dr. stopped it and will schedule my masectomy within the 2 weeks. As of last pet scan tumor responded but lymph nodes did not. Anyway since stopping taxotere 3 weeks ago my abdomen has continued to swell. It feels like jello and is starting to go around my sides to my back. My left leg continues to swell as well. Do you know what could be causing the fluid buidup? I have no pressure in chest(lungs) or any real pain so I'm guessing I'll be all right til I see doc. But any info. on what causes the buildup and what I should do will be appreciated.

First under the arm am told there is a hematoma  which is causing a huge, hard and painful double roll, can not put arm all the way down. Second, what i really need an answer to, is there is a long hard cord/rope like thing that extends from chest, under arm and then down inside of arm. The surgeon said he was not sure what it was, possibly a spasm of some sort, maybe a tendon associated with lymphedema, yet I have no swelling but weakness (arm shakes when holding coffee cup and so on). Can not lift my arm past shoulder height because it pulls clear into chest and then protrudes and can visibly be seen and feels as hard as a rock. Does anyone know what this is or have had this?
