I was wondering if it was a lymph node issue and got a little worried because my mom has leukemia. Well in a couple days the pain faded and then on Sunday 5/6/18 I woke up with my boyfriends arm over my chest and a very bad pain on my right breast. I thought maybe it was the position but the pain persisted after I got up. When I looked in the mirror later there was a big red mark on my breast (maybe the size of a kiwi) like someone had slapped me (no one did). The pain was very bad and there felt like internal itching. I showed my bf later that night and he tried to examine to see if there were any lumps. There weren't but when he touched me i shrieked in pain. So obviously I go to Dr Google and the things that came back in the search results were either mastitis or inflammatory breast cancer. I've been on antibiotics for a couple months for acne and so I am not sure if an infection would happen. My symptoms have changed some - still a mark but looks like a bruise but today it got a little inflamed. The bruise/redness is on the top of the breast near the nipple. At times it's a hot/stingy pain and always aches. Pain is both at the nipple and near the collarbone. The ache is not like when you get your period though. My underarm is kinda tender and I have pain in my shoulder (to be fair my shoulder bothers me a lot). A few days later after reading everything possible about ibc, I decide I need to call the doctor. I never go to the doctor (the antibiotics I got from an online dermatologist) and haven't had a pcp in about 15 years. I call and because I'm new I had to wait til this Friday to get in and it's with the np not the dr. So I'm pretty scared. That being said, I need to find a way to insist on getting the appropriate tests. From everything I've read, mammograms won't detect it. So my question is this- what can I do to advocate for myself in this situation? What tests do I need to ask for? I am not very assertive and to be so is terrifying but I need to be 100% sure I don't have this. I\u2019ve looked through previous forum discussions and can\u2019t find a great answer. Any advice would be appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
