Doc looked at my teeth and thought I was ok but wanted to double check with dentist. I went in yesterday and was told I did have an abcess but figured doc would proceed. I was wrong. It was a little bit of relief though. I did still go back to chemo area and spoke in depth with nurse about upcoming treatment and questions I had about chemo, and cold capping. I feel a LITTLE less anxious about it all. BUT, sure next week will be a different story. Lol",

Haha 2 questions I wanna ask you experienced gals. How long will I pee red (ac+taxol) and am I ridiculous for trying to plan something tomorrow? I know the crap se's will start if/when they do but I just dont want to waste good days with the kiddos anticipating them? Hope that makes sense? I'm sure I'll be asking more questions and will eventually be your annoying little sister. Haha! Have a great weekend everyone!!",

I get so jealous of peeps that only have 4 rounds and are done. But, I'm sure it's not fun for them either! I'm constantly told by my docs that I'm young and should handle treatment just fine. Ha! Says you doc...ur not the one doing it! I started with a swollen lymph node in my armpit, and I still feel it and it still gets a little painful. Just wish I saw some kind of results. 1/4 mm smaller in tumor and I'd be stoked! Lol Still havent cur my hair but had a dream I was choking on a strand of my hair. WHAT IS THAT! haha All in all, I could be doing so much worse and I definitely hang onto that. After Friday, I'm 1/4 of the way done! Woo hoo!!!",

Figure if I can get through 1st round I'll be good?? Only 2 days in but feeling ok. SUPER neurotic about rinsing my mouth about 10 times a day. Drinking Tons of water! I haven't had any nausea yet (knock on wood) but again, i just had infusion 2 days ago. Super nervous about the bone pain! Took my claritan so PRAYING that helps. I was told steroids help with nausea and energy? Not sure I'm a fan of the energy! I've been getting flushed (face feels really hot) but was told completely normal..GREAT! And you want me take this for 3 more days! Ugh. haha So sorry your dealing with the stomach issues. Have you looked into acupuncture. I'm on the hunt now. Have heard good things about it and figure it cant hurt. Also trying to get a weekly massage. All obviously gonna cost a bit but I figure, were pretty social so I guess my $$ that goes to us normally going out can go to these things now! Great logic, right? Haha Hbluv...my high school senior has a big baseball tournament in Florida in March...praying we can make a family trip out of it, just not sure of timelines :( Sue...alls I can say is wow! I read so many of these posts about work issues, and feel so blessed that hubby and I are self employed. My thoughts, I'd be super pissed but, if possible, I'd put it on the back burner and focus on your healing. If that's at all possible. Meaning try to not let them add additional stress? We all know, probably including them, they are definitely in the wrong! Undrago... thanks for the info! Pee seems back to normal. Lol Hope everyone has a great Sunday! Goooo BRONCOS!",
