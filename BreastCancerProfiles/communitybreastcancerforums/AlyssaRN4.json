Now that it\u2019s long enough since the biopsy hat the results could potentially be ready it\u2019s even more stressful somehow! It\u2019s all I\u2019m thinking about. I\u2019m so sorry to hear you are going through something similar. Sending good vibes your way and hoping for benign results for you!",

I\u2019m still waiting to hear the cytology on the cyst but I expect that will be fine. I haven\u2019t talked yet to my Dr about the plan now. Occasionally they still would like you to remove it, otherwise usually 3-6 month follow up testing initially is the norm. Thinking of you Emma wishing you the same outcome Bringmesomewine!",

I\u2019m 38, an RN and School Nurse, wife, and mom of 2 beautiful girls. I found a lumpy area in my left breast and went for an exam with my Gyno. I had not yet had a mammo but have very dense , fibrous, breasts. He said to be safe go for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound but expected them to be negative. Well, 2 cysts were seen with a dense area of concern above one of the cysts that the Radiologist strongly suggested be biopsied because it\u2019s \u201csuspicious, and abnormal\u201d. Ended up with a BIRAD of 4a which usually indicates suspicious but a 0-30 percent chance of cancer. Went for an ultrasound guided core biopsy (4 sections) 4 days ago. One cyst was aspirated with bloody fluid (hemmorhagic) and the other was left alone. When I finally was able to speak with my gyno after the procedure, I asked his opinion on cancer and he said \u201cYou are young so your chance of cancer is low but there is a suspicious area and if you told me you didn\u2019t want a biopsy I would have said that I STRONGLY suggest it.\u201d Feeling nervous as the results are closer to coming. Anyone else with 4a or young etcwant to share a good or bad result of their biopsy? I\u2019m not afraid of negative information I just want to get as much knowledge as I can... that\u2019s keeping me sane haha. Thanks in advance for your posts!! Log in to post a reply",
