The thought of my nipples being injected freaked me out. I asked for, and got, a RX for EMLA cream from my BS and slathered it on heavily before I went. I had already had a very bad experience with the first of my 3 biopsies, and was really scared of a repeat of that pain, which was due to not enough lidocaine being injected. I knew they would not deaden the nipple for this simple dye procedure. But, I barely felt the injection, used a very tiny needle, a slight brief burn from the dye itself was all. And I had both nipples done, as I had BMX. I was so relieved! The only thing I had a problem with was that the radiologist looked like Doogie Houser, he had to still be in high school he was so youngl!!! But his bedside manner was great and he really made me feel comfortable. His tech was a nice young man as well, and they had a female tech to stand in the room, I assume to make me feel more comfortable, which was nice. It was a breeze.",

So I had the MRI....guess what, it showed an even larger tumor in the left breast!! I had BILATERAL breast cancer. When I asked her how it was possible that the diagostic mammo/US did not show the left tumor, she said mammos are only 85% accurate.  While speaking with her last week, 7 weeks after surgery (BMX with DIEP recon), she further said that she presented my case to a group of physicians, and created an uproar because apparently ordering a pre-op MRI is NOT the standard of care and is very controversial among breast surgeons because of the costs.She says she doesn't care about the costs, she thinks it's good medicine and I agree. My left breast tumor most likely would not have been found for at least another year, and by then could have already invaded my nodes, worsening my prognosis. My SNB was clear on both sides. I'm so glad this women is my Dr.  ",

I applied it at home about 1 hr before the procedure. I was more scared of the injections than of the BMX and DIEP, as I had had my first breast biopsy done without full anesthetic effect. Apparently I need more Lidocaine then most folks so the usual amount did nothing for me. At my first biopsy, I felt like a nail gun had been shot into my chest. Twice. I ended up sobbing uncontrollably on the table, upset everyone in the room, including the radiologist performing the biopsy who apologized profusely over and over. I am normally pretty stoic, so this was not a common response for me. She immediately gave me more Lidocaine, waited for it to take effect and the rest of the biopsy was very tolerable. This experience made me very skittish regarding the nipple injections. But the Emla was very helpful.",

It's most likely OK to allow the incision to be exposed to the air, it will aid in healing.

I was originally a candidate for Rt lumpectomy/radiation, but now, BS says I seem to be at risk to develop these tumors for whatever reason, so need to have all breast tissue removed. No family hx of breast or ovarian canvcer. Am totally stunned. Even BS was shocked with the IDC being found simultaneously in the Lt breast.

Rt breast margins are clear. She says this is only the 3rd time in her career that this has happened with mastectomy. Seems it's a fine line between taking enough tissue to eradicate the BC while leaving enough for the PS to get a good result on recon. Since I had a DIEP, radiation is out as an option (no thank you anyway), so I'm headed back to surgery within 2 weeks for a re-excision on the top of the Lt breast to clean where a few microscopic cancer cells were seen at the margin by the pathologist. Same day surgery, about one hour procedure, PS will be there in case he is needed.  On an up note, I was rather pleased with the final path report overall. New stats are in my siggy. Both the Rt and Lt tumors were smaller than I had anticipated, both Stage 1, and the Lt showed only one tumor when we had expected two. Oncotype was screwed up by the hospital, so only one side's report is back which showed a score of 15 on the Lt breast. I was expecting higher since we were under the impression that I had more than one tumor present there, so I am pleased. Now waiting impatiently for the Dr's office to get the Oncotype report on the Rt breast today. Have had a few down days recently, especially after the call about needing to go back into surgery.  But today after meeting with the BS, I'm feeling more encouraged about the path report and and my first Oncotype score.
