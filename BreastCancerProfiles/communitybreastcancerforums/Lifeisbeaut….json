Lisa, I take atarax for my hives and thankfully that keeps me controlled for about 6 days.  However, it knocks me on my rear - honestly - I could take one atarax and sleep for 16 hours.  My mother in law takes Allegra for her hives and from what you say, I believe her hives condition is very similar to yours.  Mine result from things brushing against my skin.  When I flare up, you can take your fingernail or the tip of a closed ink pen and write on my arm - a few minutes later what ever you wrote is written in hives.  It's the strangest thing!  I feel my hives coming on for about 3 days before I have to take a pill.   Thank you for the thoughts and prayers!!  ..and yes, life IS beautiful. ",

Glad you weren't nauseated.  I had some breakthrough nausea but found that if I ate something, most of the time that would take care of it within a few minutes.  I had to force myself to eat and when I wanted something, I wanted one particular thing and nothing else would do.  One day it was roast beef and another it was a plain ol' hamburger.  I ate a lot of red seedless grapes too and drank Sprite with cranberry juice.  Once I started feeling more like me again, which was on the 6th and 7th day post chemo, I was starving.  I mean like I hadn't eaten in a month.  I was a cooking at 5 in the morning FOOL.  And I cooked whatever we had in the refrigerator.  My sons thought I'd lost my mind because they always ate breakfast at school and here I was up and cooking at 5 AM.  My oldest was like \"mom..  are you ok?\"  LOL  Yep.  Eat and get your butt on the bus!   ",
