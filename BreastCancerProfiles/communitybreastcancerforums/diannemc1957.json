I went to see my surgeon...he said \"probably an area of fat cells congealing as part of the healing process. This knot usually softens over time, but may linger. He said if it bothers me I can have it removed.\"..but he really didn't think it was anything...I have not worried about it that much...today went to oncologist and he said the same thing ..we will just watch...I asked him if it was your wife what would you do? He said remove it for\" her peace of mind\"..but really didn't think it was anything to worry about...he said we can watch it and see in 3 months...what are your thoughts...??
