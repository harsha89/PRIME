Before I was hit with BC i used to go out running and would be so grateful for being able to do just that- run and see and smell and be alive and felt so bad for her becuause her life was snatched away at such a young age. My sister's friend also died of BC aged 33 in 1998. She left a 7 year old girl. I really thought BC had  touched me and moved on. I could not believe what they were telling me the day I was diagnosed in Jan this year. Even having just finished chemo, i still can't. I think the reason I have taken it so bad is that the only young people I know who had BC have died. I remember when my friend was dying, I thought, I can't believe this is not happening to me - just the sort of life i've had- come to expect blows. Then bam, 9 years later I get handed the same diagnosis. It all seems so inevitable. That is what I am struggling with. I have done nothing but cry since finishing chemo. It is as if I moved out of another phase of treatment, and I can see a flicker of my old self screaming to get out of this nightmare. I am trying so hard to get some sort of seblance of a life back but I am plagued by dark thoughts, worry about death every day, feel anger and resentment that this has happended to me and jsut can't get my head round the  losses this disease has bought: loss of security of health, loss of that second baby that we can't have now, loss of my old self, loss of established realtionships and ultimately loss of life. At dinner I just look at that 4th chair round the table  where there ought to be a thriving baby and all i see is a big sign saying cancer. I am so sad x ",
