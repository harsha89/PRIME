I was on taxotere for about 10 months then they put me on tamoxifin. (I was on tamoxifin for five years previous. I felt it didn't work because my cancer did come back) So i'm not to surprised it didn't work this time. Just had my pet scan and tumor markers. They both showed activity.  I have talked to my ONC we have opted for a Oopharectomy this Thursday. He has Mentioned going on xeloda. I guess my question would be?? 1.How fast will this Ooph put me into menopause or at least for my body to act like it?          2. By me not having my ovaries will that stop or slow down the cancer?          3. What would be the main reason for xeloda and not going straight to femara??          4. Or how long does a person stay on a chemo before going on femara/AI?? Am I asking the right questions??? I just don't want to take the wrong thing that might limit my further options down the line. Thank you for your advise. Heather HEATHER PALMERTON Dx 1/18/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I was going through the same thing and yes it sucks big time, very annoying and debilitating. For me I couldn't handle the thought of taking more drugs. Because I have had Physical Therapy for other issues I thought I would try this for my feet.  At first we tried the big spa pool, felt great but I ended up getting infection under the toenails (not good) stopped therapy for a while until toes cleared up. Here is the therapy that my Physical Therapist has come up for me and so far the results have been great for me. My feet are put into a moderately warm bucket of water that has been disinfected. They place these electrodes that put out electric stimulation into the water for 15 to 20 min I set mine numbers at 123 because I have a high pain tolerance. They take those out and do underwater ultrasound for about 7 min each foot. Not sure what that is set at. Can be painful when going over a bone. They just have to keep it moving. PT dries my feet, massages them and lastly he runs this machine that we call the egg beater up and down my feet.  As a treat to me he does my back and neck. I feel like I'm walking on cotton balls. My treatment is 3xs a week and when i'm feeling good I will skip a treatment. My  ONC and nursing staff have been excited about this and would like for more patients to try this. All I can say I thought about this because I had many years of PT do to my scleroderma and thought I should try this for my feet. I am so glad I did. I know that everyone is different, we respond to things differently. I hope if you give it a try that you will get as much relief as I have.

I started chemo back in Jan (taxotere, Zometa, steroids, lots of steroids) Because I fell into the 2% of allergic reaction) The ONC told me they may not be able to do this treatment. I said that was not exceptable. We would figure something out. I felt in my heart this treatment was going to work for me. I am so glad that I stuck it out. Treatment has been going very well. A little hair thinning, a little heartburn. (nexium works great) I'm still able to work. I have major chemo brain. thats ok too,  it works really well when I do need to forget something on purpose LOL. All that being said    So last wednesday I had my ct scan and pet scan. It was so cute the tech who couldnt give me the results. Came out with the nurse with a huge smile on their face. I knew right away something was good. the only thing he said was you will be pleasantly surprised. We hugged and cried. Then I headed to the Onc for chemo treatment. I wanted the PA to look at my scans to see what i knew was good news. He was not to happy with me. He didnt even want to look at them. I was mad he was mad. then the nurses were stress because I was starting chemo so late in the day. So that day was very stressful. Finally Friday I called the ONC office to see if the results were in, they were'nt so the the nurse got on the band wagon and finally called me with the results. They were what I knew and hope for. The results were unremarkable. They were actually surprised to see how weel the treatment was doing. I actually got copies CD form of my scans from jan and recent. As my husband put it I looked like a christmas tree lite up. the recent scan you could not see a thing except some of my scleroderma. which also looked better, my sed rate is down considerably. I  still have alot of questions for my ONC when I see him next Tuesday.  All I can say is I know that my journey has just begun and I have a long road ahead of me. But this just makes me realize with alot of persiverance, attitude and alot of hope we can endure this disease with grace and dignity.  I want to thank each and everyone here for your stories and your strength. thank you for allowing me to share my story. sorry its such a book.

I was making a flower delivery at our local birthing center. The nurses beeped me in, as I  was walking in I notice a man with three little boys. The boys were all over the place just being boys. By dads tone of  voice I could sense the tension. I went about my business delivered the arrangement and on my way out I could here him, his tone was a bit louder. I heard him say my wife is 27 weeks and trying to deliver. I need to see her and the boys can't go in. He said goodbye. I hesitated to ask but i did anyways I introduced myself and offered to watch the boys so he could go and see his wife. The relief that was on his face, I knew I had done the right thing. I met the boys, two 5 year old twins and a 3 year old. With allot of energy, I manage to keep them preoccupied until dad got back. During that time one of the twins preceded to tell me that I looked like a monkey. Just about then dad comes and thanks me for helping, just as he was finished the 5 year old told dad \"HE LOOKS LIKE A MONKEY\" Poor dad turned about 10 shades of red with embarrassment. He sheepishly says sorry. I said that is okay, kids are very honest and told him that I have scleroderma and it has changed my physical appearance. \"Once again he apologized\" I felt so terrible for him. \" So now I can add that to my many disguises.

IT IS TIME TO DYE THE HAIR, I'm thinking FIRE RED.  The sad thing was he was younger than me and he looked sixty. The only thing I could say was that chemo can really mess you up.  All that and still working. Alot has happened tumor markers going up then down then up. WTH?? Changing drugs, Getting congestive heart failure. (Because of great Dr has got me in total control and told me I won't die of this. \"ONE POSITIVE THING\"). Going to Philly and meeting these wonderful ladies. So nice to put a face to a name. Can't wait to do it again.  Becoming a first time Grandma, Watching my son in law bond with his baby when he came back for leave from Iraq. PRETTY AMAZING. I have been on Xeloda since end of summer. Hand and foot syndrome painful. but i found some tricks that may help you. I'll start a thread on that. Anywho the Xeloda might be failing tumor markers on the rise. these past to weeks have been a real rollercoaster. Had to have a pet scan. they give me the CD's so I compare them to previous ones well  this one did not look very good. I get a call from my ONC office while i'm in the vets office for our cat spud. I'm ready to burst into tears. Doc Ronnie was so wonderful he made everything go smoothly and gave me huge discounts. Well The onc office says we want to see you tomorrow. I have  so many things running through my head. Can I talk to Dr Dibb? NO. WHY? He wants to see you. Of course I'm thinking it's the end. I ask can I get in today. We have an appt in one hour. My heads spinning. I tell her unless I can drive 90 MPM I might possibly get there on time. \"I LIVE IN KLAMATH FALLS\" DUH\"!!!!!! I call my husband to see if he can take me. so the following day off we go to the ONC office. We get there it's very quick to get to see him. \"Well there is light at the end of the tunnel. There is two hot spots of concern. \"He ask Does your left shoulder hurt? \"NO\" as i'm touching my right shoulder. He says not your right but your left. \" I once again said no my right shoulder hurts.\"  I told him that my calcium is growing. What about your right hip. I said yes not to bad but the calcium is growing there and on my back. He was still very concerned. So the plan is stay on xeloda test my tumor markers before and after vacation. if they rise he will add tykerb. He would like for me to have surgery to remove some of these calcium plates. I say YIPPEE.  So thats it in a hand basket. I'm sure I have forgotten something. Just as well I seem to have written a book.

First of all  HAPPY LATE MOTHER'S DAY TO ALL.  Wow being sick with pneumonia really wiped me out.I'm still exhausted. I was able to get on a few times to PM LuAnn, Then I'd go back to bed. Thank you LuAnn for keeping the ladies informed, Also Diane. It was quite frustrating being so idle, then not having chemo. They had also cancelled my pet and ct scans. I just hated it, I have heard so many of you talk about scananxiety. I was thinking so positively and the let down was almost unbarable. Well the good news is that the pneumonia is cleared and I get to have my Pet and ct scan done at the same time. crazy they can do it like that. and then I get to start chemo yeah!! I just want it to kill all those little beggers. So I hope the scans come in good too, so ladies i could use alot of prayers and lots of positive thoughts. Also ladies I have wanted to responsed to alot of the threads you have posted. I'm still trying to get my stamina back. But just know that I think of you often and my thoughts and prayers are with you. One more thing my cousin Denise from FL has been just dx with breast cancer. she is having surgery tomorrow I have told her about this site and how wonderful it is and how all of you ladies are such an inspiration. I am hoping that she finds her way here. I know shes dealing with alot right now. So if we could send her prayers. She sure could use them.

May i say we didnt ask for.  maybe they will read this and something positive will happen to them.  I must say all men are not that way. My mother was very sick for over ten years with congestive heart failure and my father was there to the end. \"he catered to her\". Back to my husband. I must say as hard as it can be i truly believe things happen for a reason.  and there is an awesome plan for all of us.  at the time i was getting sick back in 1997 my marriage was not doing so well. with out going into great detail i could have written Fatal attraction, but better. hah hah. my husband took a job in the air guard/kingsley field. my mother had past away that august. i was contemplating on moving my girls to klamath falls, but by the time oct 1998 had come around i had to quit my job because i was so sick.  At the time they thought it was lupas.  I was losing my hair, i was throwing up all the time. i had puss wounds that would literally explode, i could not change my own tampons,thank god that finally stopped. i could not go to the bathroom and sit on the toilet because of my open wounds,he would hold me so i could go to the bathroom. i could not take a bath or brush my teeth,hair, i would be so constipated that my husband would literally dig the cement out of my behind. then i would have diarhera and cramp the bed a because of the chemo i would pee the bed.he was there to clean the messes. my husband packed me everywhere we went. my husband would so carefully brush my hair teeth, change my wounds. he would call me from work just to see if i was ok.  I know some of this is blunt and to the point and know it has not been easy. There has been alot of humor. when my daughters were young we used to climb in bed and have let our frustrations out time.  we would tell each other what was bugging us and then we would get to scream and kick. as far as my husband and i this whole disease process has made us closer. we are in the 2% category and I thank him and god everyday. this is just a fraction what we have been through i hope it helps. love prayer and hugs heather HEATHER PALMERTON Dx 1/18/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I had read so much about this drug doing some wonderful things for so many ladies. But I had to wait to see if I was post menopausal.   I had the blood work done Sept 3rd, saw my ONC He said to call in a couple days to get results. So I waited until Monday to get my Zometa and ask one of my nurses. They evidentlly couldn't give me this information but he would get the message back to were it needed to be. WELL then there is a HOUSE DR call (emergency) I saw Onc and so did the nurse. Nurse evidently asked him about my results.\"Me personally\" I didn't think it was an appropriate time because they were dealing with a patient having a reaction. I could also tell by the look on his face he was a little frustrated. Which I could not blame him at all. So when my Zometa treatment was over I ask asked for my reports my labs showed everything but the hormone test. Tuesday AM I call the office they still didn't know anything I asked for them to please call me asap. I would like to get started on my meds. Wednesday AM finally a nurse calls me back. I'm not postmenopausal but she couldn't understand everything that the ONC wrote. Something about continuing or finishing chemo plan and I would start Tamoxifin. I'm trying to Question her about this. So I ask her to please call the Onc and find out exactly what all this meant. I also mentioned That I wasn't to sure about tamoxifin. I kind of felt it had failed me before. So now I'm waiting for another call. HELP For all those experienced ladies I need your help and advice. What should I do?????

There is more to the story. The most important thing right now she needs allot of prayer positive thoughts that this tumor is not mets or even cancer. I'm shooting for benign. Thank you so much Heather Marlene a prayer is being sent for you from me to you. Many gentle hugs being sent your way.  UPDATE ON MARLENE< Well they went into surgery sooner than expected. Come to find out \"thank goodness, it was not breast cancer.  It was a bit more serious, or could have been. She had a brain aneurysm. This was detected a year ago, but they were dealing with her breast cancer first and when she was done with her treatments they were going to take care of this what they thought was a benign tumor. Because of the change on the MRI they thought tumor progress. She had a major headache which was painful enough to go to the ER.  The anuerysm was fixed and it looks as though all went well and she will be on her way to recovery. \"Our prayers have been answered.

So now we call it Heather's  \"JIM BEAM.\" So heres to \"JIM BEAM\" Giving me a long run. I have hope we will have our vaccines sooner than later.

I saw the scans I pretty much looked like a did a year ago. I called my onc office this morning. They returned my call this early afternoon.  After trying to get the information and appts sorted out. I told her that all the appts scattered out was enough anxiety to kill me not the cancer. So we got it resolved. I will have muga scan 9:00am Monday morning at the hospital then we'll go over to the onc office and my port accessed blood work then at 1:00 pm talk to Onc If MUGA scan says OK I will start Adrimyicin. Right now I won't know how long I guess muga will determine this.  So thats it in a nutshell.  THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT Heather    HEATHER PALMERTON Dx 1/18/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

It is patient and forgiving when all others are forsaking, And it never fails or falters even though the heart is breaking . . . It believes beyond believing when the world around condemns, And it glows with all the beauty of the rarest, brightest gems . . . It is far beyond defining, it defies all explanation, And it still remains a secret like the mysteries of creation . . . A many splendoured miracle man cannot understand And another wondrous evidence of God's tender guiding hand. May your Mother's Day be blessed with many good memories.
