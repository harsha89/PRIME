Radiologists then ordered a mammogram and a core needle biopsy as the mass was suspicious looking. Mammogram showed a lubulated spiculate Mass of malignant appearance with indeterminate microcalifications. Waiting for my biopsy results as they shut over the weekend and I think I may go crazy! Hoping everyone else gets Benign results x",

I\u2019m a nurse so could technically look them up myself but of course don\u2019t want to breach any hospital protocols. Hoping today or tomorrow to have some answers! My lump is at 12 o\u2019clock and I am extremely bruised and sore as they had difficulty actually getting the needle into the mass as it had a thick fiborus covering and the needle kept bouncing off sorrel like I was stabbed a hundred times. Fingers crossed for you and hopefully results come soon x And thanks ladies, Netflix and dog walks are my best friends at the moment in between looking after my little ones",

Repeat biopsy isn\u2019t an option as they had so much difficulty in getting a sample the first time. I am booked in for a lumpectomy and sentinel node bx on the 24th so then a week after that I will finally find out what I am dealing with! good luck with your treatment to come x",
