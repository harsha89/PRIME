I was so frustrated and mad and scared it was all I could do not to call the doctor daily after the first week. In the end I was low risk and my MO said that chemo wouldn\u2019t need to be done since I was so low risk. I\u2019m on Tamoxifen now. I was so relieved to get the results back that I was rather shocked when I got my treatment plan. So if it takes a little longer than you expect, try not to panic.",

Breast cancer runs amok in my moms family so I was concerned about not having chemo when my MO said he didn\u2019t think it would be necessary. Ihad the Mammoprint and came back low risk. The waiting for results was a hard time because I wanted answers and was ready to start treatment. I\u2019m glad we waited. Mine came back low risk so we opted to go straight to Tamoxifen.",

When my MO said no chemo I was rather taken aback. I asked questions, got more information, and finally just trusted the science and said okay. I\u2019m thankful not to have to go through what so many others are with chemo, but sometimes I just hope I\u2019m doing the right thing. I think I might mentally feel better with chemo but if it\u2019s not going to be effective, why put myself through that",

I was initially diagnosed stage 1 but after bmx I got \u201cupgraded\u201d to stage 2. So I started here with you ladies. I am doing well. Fighting side effects from my lovely daily pill, but I really can\u2019t complain too much. I am back at work full time (and then some!) and besides staying tired I feel almost back to normal. Until the hot flashes. And night sweats. And leg cramps. But really am doing well. Hope you all are fighting on along and making good progress towards kicking cancer to the curb.",

BC is a strong trait in my family and yet all of us who were tested had negative results. We also did the Mammoprint on the tumor and that was actually the deciding factor for chemo treatment for me. So just know that genetics are only as good as the science behind it. When I was diagnosed I knew what I was going to do. Genetic testing was only done to see if there was a link/marker that they could use to help define treatment. My Surgical oncologist was ready to do a single MX but I wanted to do both, and given my family history, she agreed with me. Thankfully, I did not have to go through IV Chemo, however I was prepared to do that if necessary. I have been on Tamoxifen for almost a month now and that decision was almost completely based on the Mammoprint results. I had immediate recon, my SO and PS are both advocates of \u201cless is best\u201d when possible when it comes to surgeries. So I had BMX with TE placement. I\u2019m small so the expansion is taking a while, but it is progressing. I will say that I am not symmetrical or even pretty at this point. That\u2019s now what the TE are for. So if you do end up in the same place I am, understand that these first weeks/months are about expansion, not about pretty. It\u2019s not easy, but I have total faith in my PS that it will be right in the end. Best of luck in your test results and treatment.",

I started off with a stage 1 dx and it was \u201cupgraded\" to stage 2 when everything was all settled and all the reports and pathology came in. I have to admit, I got freaked out all over again. But... life goes on. I had nipple reconstruction in August and on Monday I am getting my tattoos and hopefully I'll be done with surgical procedures for a while. I'd like to actually recover from all this before we start talking about hysterectomy. Tamoxifen has not been fun, I have strange se like foot pain. I go next week to an orthopedic to see what he has to say about my pain. If it's not a se of tamoxifen then something else is up. Bleh. Not going to worry just yet. Hope everyone is ready for the colder weather. It does make the hot flashes a bit more bearable. And even tho it's been rather cool here at night I haven't turned on the heat. I heat enough myself thank you very much. lol",
