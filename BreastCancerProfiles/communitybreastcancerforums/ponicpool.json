Her right breast is removed and doctor suggested not to lift any weights especially with her right hand. 5 days back she had a cut in her right handÂ  fingertips in the nail area and puzz was formed in that area and due to that she had fever and admitted to hospital and 2 days later she was discharged. Yesterday her blood pressure went down and she was admitted again in hospital and doctor opened her wound at fingertipis near the nail area and cleaned it up. So high fever and low blood pressure is due to the cut she had in her fingertip? Besides could someone suggest what are the best wats to ger a better quality of life after her treatment is over and post treatment life? Thanks Log in to post a reply",
