After neo-adjuvant chemo, surgery and radiation, I started hormonal treatments. While on Femara I developped quite rapidly skin mets (oct.2016) and went for a new set of radiotherapy. Unfortunately, during the sessions, new skin-mets appeared. So I moved to other hormonal therapies, followed by targetted therapies. Each of which failed. In march I started Xeloda, which in turn didn't help. So, I went through a series of tests in order to check whether I could apply for clinical trials. The latest biopsy shows now : \"triple negative\". I'm wandering whether anyone else had a similar (or opposite) change. I'd also like to understand whether this is due to \"cell-mutation\" or if it could be that all hormone-responding cells were killed ... and that only non-responsive are still there. Thanks. I make use of this message to send you all big hugs.

I just heard that I wasn't selected for the clinical trials as my mets cannot be quantified via CT-scan (only PET-scan & MRI). Bad luck, as for the rest I passed all criteria's. So, back to chemo. I have an appoinment on tuesday with my onc and will ask her to perform a chemo-sensitivity testing. I didn't know it was possible. Fingercrossed they'll allow it. Anyway I'll keep dancing in the rain :-) Send you a lot of hugs through our belgian clouds ;-)",

I'm new to this forum, and not sure whether I should be considered stage III or IV (I couldn't get a clear answer to the question from the doctors so far). I was diagnosed with a ductal infiltrating breast tumor (almost 6cm) in april 2015. After neo-adjuvant chemo (may - october), surgery and radiotherapy till feb.2016, I received preventive hormono-therapy (femara). However by end september 2016, a strange spot (which I first thought to be an insect bite) appeared on my abdomen. After a new surgery, I started radiotherapy again. But before the end of the sessions, new spots appeared, this time on the left breast. I started other hormonal therapies, and even a targetted therapy (which seemed to work for 2 or 3 months). Now the skin mets are exploding and extending to the right breast. Last week I received first injections of Faslodex. As so far none of the hormone therapies worked, I'm not sure this one will make a difference. So I wandered whether there were other patients with skin mets ... and whether I should raise this question here or under stage III ?  Thank you  ",
