      "Content": "Sallyellen wrote: Hi, I am new to this board and would greatly appreciate any suggestions. I live in Maryland and had bilateral mastectomy in June(for small stage one invasive breast cancer, not in lymph nodes) with reconstruction at end of September. No chemo or radiation needed thankfully. However, I have cording issues which cause me great pain and reduce my range of motion. I have been going to physical therapy 3x a week at a lymphadema center for 4 months and do exercises on my own on the other days. The cording won't break up. I have been uncomfortable like this since June and am getting somewhat discouraged(although I realize I am very lucky in comparison with many other people). I am finally back at work and doing a little bit better. But I am still on small doses of pain meds, advil, valium. I am wondering if there is anything else I can do for the cording or any other experts to see. I just keep thinking to myself that there must be a procedure or injection that can help this. My oncologist gave me a prescription for lidocaine patches which actually help. But I really want to get rid of the cording itself. My ps and therapist just say it will break up in time. But it is deep, runs from armpit probably to my chest and is driving me crazy. I don't go out much on the weekends and it gets a bit depressing. Thanks in advance for any help.

I experience pain under my arm-entire armpit area which is debilitating at times. I am wondering at this point if maybe I have post mastectomy pain syndrome as this started after my may mastectomy and has continued. I live in Maryland and was trying to find some type of specialist to go to. At this point physical therapy is helping but not enough. My breast surgeon and plastic surgeon have both pretty much written me off. They both said they couldn't do anything else to help me, didn't even look at the cording, and told me to keep stretching. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Happy holidays to everyon Log in to post a reply",
