I just read that there are issues with permanant hair loss with Taxotere that worsens when combined with Cytoxan. Has anyone heard about this or experienced it? Log in to post a reply",

I spoke with an oncology nurse at ACS and my oncologist (both practicing for many years) and they both said they never encountered a patient with permanent hair loss and the nurse mentioned only 1 patient had some thining of the hair. My uncle had a lot of chemo over many cycles before he passed last year (he had a different cancer) and he had his hair until just before he passed.",
