Just my thoughts....",

Anything to offset the probabilities.  You are luckier in the sense that the toxicity for the treatment of Hodkin's Lymphoma was likely less than the initial MOPP. In addition, the DIEP flap will probably be better than the implant route that I chose.  I just couldn't wrap my head around the length of surgery required to the the autologous tissue transfer.   Good luck!!!  Wishing you the best!   Mary Ann  ",
