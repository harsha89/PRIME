UCSF just completed a study on cold caps and sent me information on their study. 68% would overwhelming recommend the cold caps. A few others said it was a lot of work but it did the job it is supposed to do. Not one of their patients required a wig. There next study ( hopefully this year) is to gain FDA approval. Ladies, this is huge because maybe insurance companies will pick up the cost. Right now it is expensive and a lot of work if your treatment center does not have the right freezers, but it will only be six days of my whole life (at least I'm hoping I will never need chemo again). I'm praying for a cure so nobody will have to make a choice to use the cold caps or not. Wishing everyone here a speedy recovery!!",

      "Content": "May 31, 2013 11:07PM - edited May 31, 2013 11:29PM by Rhonda2 Hi Everyone, I'm new to this thread and starting rads June 10th. I will be getting 5 weeks of rads in the prone position and the last week a boost in the supine position. I feel better knowing that I will be in the prone position as medical case study shows it is better and less radiation to my lung. I had a lumpectomy on my right side so I'm not too worried about it hitting my heart. I have a friend that has burned from the radiation which does scare me, but my MO said the prone position is also better for my skin. I don't know what is offered in your area, but I'm glad my DH researched it so I could receive the best treatment. Prone position was not originally offered to me. It was only after we asked about it that I was referred to a place in my city that is trained and doing it this way for 3 years. In all of our cases, I pray that we are receiving the best care available and for our speedy recoveries!",

I had my first boost (1 of 7) and its been just fine. During the treatment my skin got pink and warm, but never oozed or I never got prickles of redness. I use Cavilon every Monday and Thursday and use it as a spray. It dries quickly and leaves a film on my breast and underarm. No lotions or ointments were needed. Once I'm done with treatment I can start back using Aveeno lotion. From reading everyone's posts we all respond differently so I'm hoping you will have an easy time with it. Best of luck to everyone!",

He also reassured me that all precautions are taken to keep lungs and heart safe.",
