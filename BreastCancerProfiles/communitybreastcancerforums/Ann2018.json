This part is not what worries us the most,it\u2019s the results. Take care and please let us know how it went and results. I am hoping to get a call from the doctor by Friday. I guess if he says he needs to see me that usually means bad news. ",

I think I\u2019ve read almost everting on the site and I understand that it shouldn\u2019t hurt, but still scared. I think I am more scared about getting results than having the biopsy, but i\u2019ll cross that bridge a few days after biopsy. Thank you Ann Log in to post a reply",

But again, this lasted mb a minute. I\u2019ve read that some had these great nurses that kept talking to them & holding their hand. I had nothing like that. Nurses were very professional but not compassionate. But the doctor was awesome. I am going to call my appointment scheduler & thank her bc she changed my appointment from 27th to today and I am grateful. After about 5 hours it started to hurt so I took 2 Tylenols. The side still hurts but it\u2019s bearable. I am sleeping in my zip front bra not to have them plop around. Other than that I am in a waiting & hoping for the best mode. Good luck with the stereotactic, just ask for a lot of numbing. You can do this, sometimes we surprise ourselves at how strong we are. Please let me know how it went & please think positive. Ann",

I think it should be very similar, just the image taking is different. But please read the info on this site, the girls are a wealth of information. The night was a bit restless as I couldn\u2019t find position to fall asleep except being prepped very high up almost in sitting position. Once I went for the ice pack. I took off the bandage in the morning and looked at the side of my breast. It\u2019s not bruised yet, I think it will come later, but the initial site is sore to the touch and I can\u2019t stretch my arm. Hopefully tomorrow i\u2019ll feel better and go to work, but my boss was very understanding even tho I never told him what kind of procedure I am having; he told me to let him know if I need to take another day off too. What I strongly recommend is taking the day off the next day after the biopsy if you can, especially if it\u2019s not an office type job. But again, everyone is different. I do however have a high pain tolerance ",

How long do you think until he calls me? Doesn\u2019t he realize when the doctor of radiology tells you that you have abnormality and you need a biopsy, right the way a person thinks the worst and when the results come in your doctor needs to call right the way so the patient doesn\u2019t have to wonder & cry all the time like I did. I am never going to see that doctor again.really disappointed that doctors that pledge the Hippocratic Oath during medical school still have no compassion. Shame.",

Like most of you said the worst part is the shot and I asked the doctor to give me as much as legally allowed. The doctor was extremely nice & caring, answered all my stupid questions. I started to cry at one point not because it hurt but because she was so super positiveand I felt sorry for myself. The procedure itself took maybe 10 minutes at best, just the signing & explaining, and at the end the mammo combined was about an hour. Thank you to all for the tip with zip front sports bra. I took the day off work tomorrow, just to rest and take it easy. So now the waiting begins: 3-5 days. Wow, they do take their time.",
