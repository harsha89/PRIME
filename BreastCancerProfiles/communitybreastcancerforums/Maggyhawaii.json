Her-2 was 2+. I had 3 FISH tests done because the tumor  tested positive and  negative. The tumor was 1.4 cm. I'm very confused about this situation. First the doctors said I wouldn't need chemotherapy , only radiation and hormomal therapy.Then they changed their minds and told me that chemotherapy was necessary. My first appointment for chemo is next week. I'm a little worried .From what I read so far ,  this type of cancer is very aggressive and recurring, most the time.. I hope someone out there can help me understand what to expect. Thank you Surgery 7/30/2012 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Left Log in to post a reply",
