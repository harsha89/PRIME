I was holding my own, breathing what have you,,wheb he found that it didn't cause pain. He then took my hand and placed the other on my shoulder and told me that he was sorry twice. Now I am frightened. I wonder if he knows something that i don't, My mammogram and ultra sound is tomorrow. I understand after the test are read l, the specialist will want to perfoem a biopsy. I'm a positive person. But I scared. Just wanted to post where others understand. Please forgive typos on an older tablet. Log in to post a reply",
