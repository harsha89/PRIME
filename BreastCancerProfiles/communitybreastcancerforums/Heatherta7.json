They turned me away with my doctor referral, orders, images, but have been helpful in finding other funding to perform the other tests once I have all necessary paperwork completed. Problem is, I made too much money when I worked. Now that I'm unemployed I'm being penalized for my previous years income. Cobra is 2100 a month so I can't do that. Trying other avenues and not giving up. Staying patient. My appt is next Thursday. I have two masses. 1 cm and 1.7 cm. That is all I know at this point.",

What are the percentages in yalls opinions on mass findings over 1 cm being benign? Just curious. Does size matter any? Guess I'm just curious from people in this group if they have had 1cm+ masses found to be benign. And what should I be asking at my next appointment? I want to be informed.",
