There IS a BS, in Anchorage which is about 3 hours away, BUT our insurance wouldn't cover the general surgeon or the BS so I decided just in case I get hinky results I might as well only see one specialist. Also insurance said they won't cover the diagnostic mammo or ultrasound- which makes it REALLY hard to want to go do them. In my gut I know I'm fine, so paying just to find out I'm fine seems so awful! Then again if it does come back \"something\" it's worth every penny. I'm starting to think this situation sucks! I have a notepad, I love the idea of keeping it all together. I'm going to make sure to ask the radiologist who will call so I know who to bug :) I don't want to dig any deeper into \"what-ifs\", I think truely this is simply a weird thing going on and NOT cancer. I've read that inverted nipples can be lots of things, even just getting older. Plus I nursed 6 kids with those babies- they gotta be tired! So no reason to freak myself out. I do like knowing what steps I need to take right now, and let tomorrows worries happen tomorrow, you know? So mammo is scheduled for Oct 1st- I can post an update after. Any other advise you think I need is welcome.",

You are so right about Alaska being so much more expensive and logisically difficult to get health care. I know you traveled out of state, and depending on how it plays out I may pick your brain about that. Mammo is still scheduled for the 1st. I'm not particularly anxious, but just ready to be over with it.",

So a dianostic mammo and us is covered after we have met our $3000 deductable....so basically we will have to pay at 100% OOP until it reaches the deductable. Right now we don't have anything towards it since we really never get sick. After we get to the $3000 then BCBS pays at 80% for in network and 50% out of network. So either way looks like I will have to pay a few thousand. Butthanks for the tip on \"pinktober\" I called the hospital and there may be a program that will pay for the diag. mammo, US and BS!

After both my previous mammo's I got called in for a recheck and ultrasound, which I was told is super common with fiberous breasts. So far both times it was all fine. I finally understand the dense breast/detecting cancer problem, THANK YOU! We are not VERY rural, Kpeninsula :) Would you think it better to cancel the general surgeon and make an appt in Anchorage with a Breast Surgeon? Surely we have on there. I'm thinking money wise, I'm not sure how much of anything besides the mammo our insurance will cover. (Premera/BCBS)",

Here's the update, which is pretty much me in the exact same boat: Type 2 plateau patterns on an MRI are cancerous indications between 10-80 percent of the time. The plateau pattern was right under the nipple, and that is where my issues seem to be. The other breast was fine and had type 1 patterns. I was only given a Birads 2. My gen surgeon said that since no mass/tumors were seen that I am ok to do 6 month follow ups. I was very happy with this info, until today, when I am starting to wonder if I am making the right decision by just sitting back and waiting- which feels an awful lot like just waiting for cancer. At this point I could make an appointment with the breast surgeon in Anchorage and get a 2nd opinion or just be happy that everything looks...well it doesn't look good and it doesn't look bad, it just looks. Anyone want to help me out here with some wise council?",
