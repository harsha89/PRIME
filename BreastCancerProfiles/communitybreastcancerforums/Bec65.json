      "Content": "Oct 30, 2014 07:01PM Bec65 wrote: Hi, ladies. I'm also dropping in from the November 2013 thread.  I had my first chemo exactly one year ago today. I can't believe it!   Re advice:  Use BC.org often (it was my lifeline), but do realize everyone is different.  It still amazes me what some of us experience that others don't, even though we are on the same protocol.  I agree with everything Lisa137 and Palameda wrote (as always....love you!), but here a few more tidbits that come to mind: Water:  (I'm beating a dead horse here, but it's THAT important.)  Drink 2 quarts each of the two days prior to chemo, the day of chemo, and at least one day after.  Staying this hydrated will minimize nausea and will flush the chemo out of you faster.  Besides, every time you call your advice nurse with ANY question or concern, they are going to ask you if you are getting plenty of fluids.  I swear this is universally true.  Do not let lack of water cause you problems! Antinausea medication:  Take it preventatively and consistently.  Do NOT try to be strong and \"push through the pain.\"  Now, having said that, Zofran can leave you with a wicked headache.  If this happens, skip it and go straight to Compazine or Ativan. Medication log:  Make one.  You think you're going to remember when you took that Zofran, but when you feel like crap in 6 hours, you won't remember, trust me.  I made an Excel spreadsheet because mega-organizing makes me feel like I'm in control, but a handwritten chart will do.  Believe me, when Zofran is once every 8 hours, Compazine is once every 6 hours, and Ativan is once every 4 hours, you're going to want a chart.   Your \"status:\"  Do not assume that how you feel today is how you will feel tomorrow.  Yes, that cuts both ways -- you may feel fabulous the day after chemo because you've had a mega-dose of steroids.  The next day?  Not so much.  On the flip side, just because you feel like crap on Monday, that doesn't mean you'll still be on the couch on Tuesday.  SEs are weird and fickle.  Capitalize on your good days and enjoy your television on your low days.  Be flexible! Sensodyne Toothpaste:  I have had canker sores my entire life, but I used Sensodyne all through chemo and never had one.  Maybe it was a coincidence, but I thought I should pass that along.   I also have some more personal tidbits to offer that are more related to dealing with BC in general -- wisdoms I've gained you could say.  I think a lot about time now and the passing of time.  I remember before I started any treatment, a nurse told me it would be half over before I knew it.  She was right, actually!  It's been over a year since all of this started for me, and on most days, it feels like it happened to someone else.  I do live in the moment now.  It was a concept I just didn't grasp before cancer.  I HATE that it had to be cancer to deliver that message, but here I am.  I also think about my strength.  I still am in shock to think I stood in my bathroom and gave MYSELF injections in my stomach.  It's just crazy to think of what I've endured and dealt with.  You will find strength you didn't know you had.   For those of you with kids, I do want to share something I learned the hard way.  I didn't tell my kids (13, 17, and 19 at the time) about what was going on until I could say it without crying.  And even then, I explained it very clinically and told them, quite simply, that the coming year would just be a bump in our road.  I never let them see me cry.  It was important to ME that I showed them how to be strong and brave.  The thing I learned, though, was that it was important to and for THEM that I show them how to be afraid.  Be genuine with your family.  It may not be sunshine and roses but life isn't always, and our kids need to and can learn how to have a mom with cancer.  We are all more resilient than we think! Please, please, please do not hesitate to PM me with any questions!  The info I got here from those who walked before me was gold. ",

For all my zaps except to the supraclav area, a brass mesh is placed on my skin.  The techs said this is to keep the radiation close to my skin.  My RO said she'll meet with me next Monday, when I have 5 left, to discuss when to remove the mesh.  What I didn't understand is why we're removing the mesh.  She explained it very technically, then tried much more simplistically when I said I didn't understand all the big words.  As soon as I got in the car, I realized I didn't even understand the dumbed-down version.  Any ideas? Re the SEs other are discussing, all I accomplish each day is a 4-mile walk (critical for my mental health but a time suck -- I'm MUCH slower than I used to be) and a trip to radiation.  I'm wiped out after lunch.  Also, I'm sore internally under my left arm/back area.  I don't know if this has anything to do with rads, or nerves waking up post-BMX.  (I'm still numb in that area.) Re supplements, my RO is okay with Omega-3, but I stopped vitamin C and multivitamins on my own after asking Dr.Google.  I still take calcium, B6 (for chemo neuropathy) and iron.   Thank you!",

Thank you again for explaining it all to me.  I see her again on Monday when she'll decide when it comes off and I go commando for treatments.  I *think* it has something to do with how well my skin is holding up, but I'll confirm and post.",
