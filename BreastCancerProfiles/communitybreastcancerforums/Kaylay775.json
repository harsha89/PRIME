Does anyone on here know the symptoms or breast appearance of ILC beast cancer is? I have read a few articles on it but there is not much out there only that it is a very fast cancer, hard to diagnose and not even a mammogram or ultrasound will catch it, you cannot feel a breast lump as you do with typical breast cancer. My mother passed from that when I was only 3 yrs old, she was 28. I never got to know her and everyone I ask even her parents (my grandparents) they don't remember her symptoms, all they could tell me is that she was fairly young and that cancer took her rather quickly. Please anyone with information that can help me will be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
