I'm triple negative just like the last time.  I had bone scan and CT's all clear, One onc says taxotere and cytonan, every 3 weeks times four.  What is eveyones elses thoughts.",

This is my 2nd time.  I was diagnosed with BC April 27, 06 and again in Jan. of 08. Just because you've been there ,doesn't make it any easier, I'm just more resigned that this is the only way to beat this monster.  So I'm an April member too.  Best of luck to all who are having tx tomorrow, It seems I'll be with an amazing bunch of ladies. Good Luck and God be with all of us. Leesa ",
