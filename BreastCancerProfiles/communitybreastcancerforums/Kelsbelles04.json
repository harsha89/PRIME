They did a stereotactic biopsy on one area only. Negative. Followed up with 2 more times 6 months between with mamm. No change but in the back of my mind i keep thinking and wondering if they should have biopsied both areas. Thoughts? I have very lumpy breast tissue. Early menopause at 44. Does anyone know if checking only one area is standard procedure? Also is change in calcifications on a mammogram the only way to determine early bc? Thank you. I'm feeling paranoid :( Log in to post a reply",
