From what I've found, the SSA has something called a Compassionate Allowance Program which actually expedites your disability claim and Breast Cancer, is #2 on the SSA's compassionate allowance list. The ONLY downside is that there is no separate application for the compassionate allowance program so you have to stay on top of them. Look up the SSA's Compassionate Allowance Program, it will give you tons of info. As far as the STD and SSI, I don't know.....I hope this helps",
