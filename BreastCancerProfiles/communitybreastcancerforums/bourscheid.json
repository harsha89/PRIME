As you know, the original diagnosis showed cancer had spread in most if not all the nodes of the chest and supraclavical (collar bone) area as well as multiple (at least 7) lesions (tumors) in the liver - two of which were 8cm or larger. There was also some plural effusion and possible spinal lesions.  Well... all of the cancer is GONE except for one small (2 cm) area in the liver!!!!!  We are overjoyed (including the onc)!  Dr. M said the response was way better than he had dared to hope for!   I will now go for two more cycles of abraxane/avastin (6 tx) the first of which I had today.  After that we will rescan and decide on what if any further treatment is needed.

PS. Please add a prayer for one of the families in my class.  They were in a horrible wreck last night.  My student (Leigh Ann) is home from the hospital with an Aunt.  Her mother, Becky, and little sister, Katie were not so lucky.  Becky has a broken arm and some head trauma and little Katie (2nd grader) has damage to her lungs and is on a respirator as well as a broken nose.  The Drs. say the next 48 hours are critical for both of them.  Keep this family in your prayers (the Stiles family).  This just goes to show us that it could always be worse. Hope everyone has a great day and feels well! Hugs! Lori",

What an amazing outpouring of love and support!  They all work pink today when I went for my first chemo.  Speaking of the chemo...well the rug was kinda pulled out from under us when we got to the cancer center this morning.  After a clear MRI of the brain and good muga scan, the PET scan was bad news.  The cancer has already spread: a lesion on the liver, multiple lymph nodes in the area under the collarbone and sternum are \"active\"; and possibly 2 areas on the spine.  I'll have a bone scan next friday (10/9) to confirm this possiblity.  That said, the chemo drugs have been changed to address these new issues.  I am now taking Abraxane and Avastin.  I will have chemo once a week for 3 weeks then two weeks rest then another cycle of once a week for 3 weeks.  After that there will be another PET scan to confirm that the chemo is effective.  If it is not working as fast as hoped then another drug (5fu) will be added.  The doc said that while he cannot say I can be \"cured\" now, I am definitely treatable.  The fact that I am presenting no symptoms is encouraging and makes him hopeful that this course of treatment will be effective in arresting and killing the cancer cells. He also said that though this is a more aggressive treatment (One of the drugs is a biological) the SE's may be milder than the AC-T.  I am still feeling well after chemo today (almost 4 hours out and hungry) and will stay home tomorrow and over the weekend to rest.  I will continue to work on M-W and Thurs am as long as I am feeling well.  Staying home would make me crazy.  :-)   I am still feeling positive that I can beat this beast!     Love you all!

Deb:  so sorry you aren't feeling well.  You should be through the worst of it.  I find that when I can stop taking the anti-nausea meds my energy starts to return (especially the compazine as it makes me very sleepy).  Try to take short walks (even if only for 5 min. at a time) as it does help to move around a bit.  And don't ever apologize for whining...that's what we're here for!  Sometimes you ladies are the only ones I feel I can whine to because I know  you will understand and also not panic that something is going wrong (dh panics easily about any SE).  Tomorrow is #5 for me so today I hydrate, hydrate, hydrate (guess I'd better go dump my coffee and switch to water now ).  I had so much energy and felt better yesterday than I have since my diagnosis in Aug.  I even went out and played ball with my class - boy are my arms sore today - especially on the port side!  Then I went for a walk while they were in band and learned just how out of shape I am - only made it about 2/3 of a mile before I had to quit.  Plan on walking again today at the same time - maybe I can do a mile today - but no ball for me! Has anyone's hair stopped falling out?  I think all my brown hair fell out and the gray just keeps growing!  Of course it's mostly around the sides and back and the top is practically bald - kind of reminds me of how my grandfather used to look!    I also still have to shave the pits and legs - when is the hair I want to lose going to go?

Kathi - I've had to let lots of kids know about my hair (i teach elem school) and I just kind of let them take the lead.  Some want to see and others don't.  My kids in my class all want to see on a regular basis so I just pop off my hat for them.  I would talk to the mom and let her prepare them ahead of time as to why you are losing your hair (or get her permission to talk to them about it ) so that she and/or you can answer questions.  AFter the first time, the novelty is gone for the kids though.  My class said the other day...We don't even remember what you looked like with hair.  You don't have to wear a hat or wig if you don't want to.  I will though for the littler kids (plus my head gets cold!).

I understand your worry and I don't know much about herceptin and carboplatin but from the abraxane viewpoint you're going to be fine.  The other ladies are right - the side effects are much more easily managed and you need to let your onc know your concerns as well as any effects you have.  Keep us posted and let us know what we can do to help you get through this! Unique:  You are an amazing woman!  Thank you so much for keeping tabs on all of us ladies!  I appreciate your insight so much! A little funny:  just when things were going great...I had to order bifocals today!  Went to order contacts and needed an exam.  Doc was concerned about me wearing contacts during chemo as some chemo is very drying to eyes.  Well...I was more worried about having to not wear contacts than I was about losing my hair...how's that for vain!  Luckily, I can still wear contacts during the day but had to order bifocals for days when my eyes are too dry and for the evenings...guess I'm older than I thought.  A good thing...when I let her know I had mets to the liver and lymph nodes she checked my eyes to make sure there was no evidence of cancer there (BC can spread to the eyes) and they were in excellent shape with no evidence of any problems whatsoever!  Now... if only my onc can tell me that things are improving with the liver and nodes I'll be so happy!",

Met with the oncologist (Dr. Manfredi) today and he was very pleased with how I am tolerating the chemo.  He said the blood work is all good and in the normal ranges and my body is staying strong.  He was pleased.  My question for him was \"Is it okay to be feeling this good?\"  He laughed and said yes!  The treatment they have me on (abraxane/avastin) is well tolerated and allows for a very good quality of life while still attacking the cancer strongly.  He was also pleased to see I was still working and able to keep my white blood counts in the normal range. He was worried at first about me being around so many kids all day but now he says keep on doing what I'm doing!     The new schedule for me is as follows:   One more cycle (three treatments 11/26, 12/4; and 12/11) of chemo; then a break between Dec. 11 and Jan 8!  During the break I will have a PET/CT scan (Dec. 29) to see how well the chemo is working.  I have to be off of chemo for at least two weeks before a PET/CT can be done. I'm looking forward to having that long chemo break during the Christmas holiday!  I will then meet with the Dr. on Jan. 8 to discuss the results of the scans and plan the next phase of treatment.  I'm scheduled for another chemo that day as well to start the 4th cycle.  Please keep the prayers coming that I remain strong and that the chemo is working to rid my body of this cancer.    Love to all!

I agree with others, only you know your daughter.  My son did tell me that if I had kept it from him he would have been very angry and hurt. Hope this helps. Hugs and blessings! Lori",
