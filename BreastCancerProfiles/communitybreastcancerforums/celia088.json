LuAnn, how did you get those doggies to line up in the first pic??  You must be a good dog trainer! Joni, Thor almost looks like a \"wrinkle dog\" (forget what breed they are). Ausborn, Ellie looks like a statue of a Sphinx....beautiful!  I have a black cat too, who had to be on children's Prozac for several years because he is so crazy!! He is the reason that i can't have another dog now--he hates other animals and bugs my other cat that he grew up with. Gracem, George the \"boyfriend\"..hahaha....My oldest cat who is 17, I refer to as my little \"husband\"...he is very jealous.  wishiwere, the Cockers have 80's type hairdos--long and curly. suecco, your Boxers are amazing.  Boxers are such sweet dogs.  Sige, beautiful dogs!  I have a combo of cats like your combo: one striped and one black.  My striped one talks all the time and is very bossy.  The black one is very very hyperactive and looks just like your black kitty with the same sweet face. Fitztwins, Bella is adorable.  Love this thread!!! Thanks to all of you for this fun!!! ",

So, i had another lumpectomy (different surgeon and different hospital), and this time the surgeon removed the nipple along with more of the breast tissue.  Again, the margins were not clean, and there was another bit of DCIS that was found.  I was told that a 3rd lumpectomy was not really recommended since new DCIS was found (which was not on the mammogram or Ultrasound) and the surgeon, the oncologist, and the radiation oncologist all thought that a mastectomy was preferred in the event that there was even more DCIS.  It was my choice and i decided that i should have a mastectomy because i didn't want to have constant anxiety, worrying if they got it all in the surgery.  I also had a lot of risk factors for breast cancer: HRT for 8 years, overweight, never had children, and i also had a slightly questionable BRCA test and family history according to the geneticist, although i tested negative.  My plan was to have reconstruction.  I had surgery to have an expander placed and it became infected and had to be removed.  I ended up getting a prosthesis which i do not like one bit, however, i am still glad six years later that i had the mastectomy and no rads.  I do know many women who had rads and a lumpectomy and some have had problems such as thyroid issues, teeth issues, etc.  I also have not worried nearly as much about having the breast cancer recur since that breast is gone.  I could also have more recon surgery in the future, if i ever decide to do this, but probably won't because i have had enough surgery---2 lumpectomies, 1 mastectomy, and 2 recon surgeries in one years time, not counting a knee replacement surgery 5 months before all of this.  I do have more peace of mind now because i had the mastectomy, so it is definitely worth it in my case.  Good luck to all who are making this personal decision. I did have a 2nd and a 3rd surgical opinion in order to make my decision.",

If i decide to have a prophy mast on the left i will definitely want another SNB.  I would rather have the SNB than have horrible anxiety wondering if they got all the bad stuff.",

Sheesh, that would upset anyone, and is certainly not enough info.  I would try to pin the onc down on why he thinks this, and what and where this progression is.  Perhaps you can ask him to please do your scan sooner than the 21st.  Ask him why the wait till the scan and is this ok to not be having chemo till them?    z, just try to pick his brain and don't settle for an answer that only indicates HIS choice of what to do next and which does not answer the \"why\"---try to pin him down on all the possible chemos, what they would do, and which one would be best for what ever progression this is.   Ask him what the protocol is for your case.  Perhaps he has discussed it with other oncs or the Tumor board at your Cancer Center, and i would ask him  about that.  From everything i have read about the progression to the supraclavicular nodes, it is not as common as other mets, so i am thinking that the protocol for treatment could vary. Have you googled the Sutent or the Navelbine?  I know i have heard about the Navelbine with other people, and i think i remember that SillyMissyMoo had Navelbine and it helped, if i remember correctly.  I will try to find her email addy, but since my Mac email program crashed in early september, i have lost all of my email (and addies) from 06 and half of 07, so don't know if i have it, but i will try to find someone who does have it. I also would try to talk to the onc about the PARP meds even tho Canada does not have them.  He should at least know about them and what they can do for your case. You and i first found a reference to them quite a while ago on the internet (googling while on the phone) and they are getting a lot of attention now. Push him on this subject, even if he is uncomfortable talking about it.  He needs to let you know what can possiblly help you, whether it is available or not.  Remember CalGal got turned down from the trial at first but her onc went to bat for her.  Ask your onc if you can get the PARP trial for \"compassionate care\" like CalGal suggested.  Tell him that you WANT TO LIVE!!!!!!! and ask him what is the best chemo or med for you, and does he know of any trials he can help you get in. I know you are tired of fighting and i know how exhausted you are, but you must reach inside yourself and pull out a bit more energy to try to motivate the onc. Don't just settle for his answers because he is an authority figure.  He is human and we don't always know the best thing to do.  Of course, i wish you could have a 2nd opinion from another onc who is NOT in your onc's immediate realm. Remember that your neck nodes are not so common and getting more opinions should be a necessity. I am home tomorrow (Veteran's Day) and if you want to call i would love you to do that.  Maybe we can google the chemos or find SillyMissyMoo.  Hang in there sweetie, you are much much stronger than you give yourself credit for. love you!! c  ps---print out what CalGal wrote about her progress on the PARP and give it to your onc!!!!! ",

I will be thinking white light and good thoughts for you.  I emailed my brother who works at AstraZeneca in Wilmington, DE and gave him the info about the KuDOS trial (subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca.  KU-0059436 - also called ICEBERG1) and asked him to find out phone numbers for AZ drug inquiries or for KuDOS or general numbers that can direct you to to someone who knows about this trial.  In the meantime, i hope Calgal can get you the number a lot quicker, since she has the direct info about it. I googled some stuff about Sutent and Navelbine. You have probably done that by now but here are 2 sites i found: www.chemocare.com/bio/Sutent.asp www.cancerbackup.org.uk/Treatments/Chemotherapy/Individualdrugs/Vinorelbine Good luck Dawn!!!  Please let me know if i can help in any way.   lots of love, C ",

I am praying that you continue to get good news and good scans. Thanks for PMing Dawn the phone number because i am not at all sure that i have the right phone number. Here is the article i got from The Healthcare Sales and Marketing Network: Myriad Genetics Collaborates With AstraZeneca on Phase 2 Trials Studies to Determine If Women With BRCA1 & BRCA2 Mutations May Receive Greater Benefit From New Treatment SALT LAKE CITY, UT--(HSMN NewsFeed)--Jun 19, 2007 -- Myriad Genetics, Inc. (NasdaqGS:MYGN ) (www.myriad.com) today announced the start of two Phase II trials for a new compound being tested to treat patients with BRCA1 & BRCA2 positive breast and ovarian cancer. AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN ) KuDOS Pharmaceuticals is running the international, multi-center clinical trial and will reimburse Myriad for provision of the molecular diagnostic testing for the trial. Myriad has exclusive worldwide rights to diagnostic applications of the findings from the study and KuDOS, all rights to its therapeutic applications. The ICEBERG (International Collaborative Expertise for BRCA Education and Research through Genetics) studies are intended to evaluate the ability of AZD2281 (KU-0059436), a PARP (poly-ADP-ribose polymerase) inhibitor, to treat patients with breast cancer or ovarian cancer associated with an inherited mutation in one of the cancer genes, BRCA1 or BRCA2. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are involved in DNA repair and when this function is lost due to a mutation, cells are unable to repair breaks in DNA. Research has shown that women who inherit mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are predisposed to a higher incidence of breast and ovarian cancer. It is hypothesised that PARP inhibitors work by inhibiting DNA repair in the BRCA deficient tumour cells, thereby overloading these cells with DNA damage and selectively killing these cells. The trials will evaluate the extent of patient response to the treatment and time-to-disease progression amongst other indicators of clinical benefit. Lead Investigator for the trials, Dr Andrew Tutt, clinician scientist at the Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre and breast oncologist at Guy's Hospital, London, said: \"Having demonstrated the potential of PARP inhibitors through lab work carried out at the Breakthrough Research Centre, we hope these trials will help us confirm the results in the clinic, leading to the development of a targeted treatment for this type of cancer.\" Gregory Critchfield, M.D., President of Myriad Genetic Laboratories, Inc., commented, \"There is enormous potential for patient benefit from the synergy between the molecular diagnosis of breast or ovarian cancer and a specific, targeted therapeutic. Myriad's BRACAnalysis® test is a highly sensitive proven method for finding mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Individuals with breast or ovarian cancer who carry these mutations are candidates for the PARP inhibitor therapy approach. It may become more important than ever to know whether a patient with breast or ovarian cancer is BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation positive.\" ICEBERG Study Details The two studies will enroll up to 40 patients each:  -- Breast study: phase II, open-label, non-comparative, international,  multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of AZD2281  given orally in patients with advanced BRCA1- or BRCA2-associated  breast cancer.  - Entry criteria - measurable advanced breast cancer (stage IIIB/IIIC/IV) and confirmed BRCA+ status.  -- Ovarian study: phase II, open-label, non-comparative,  international, multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety  of AZD2281 given orally in patients with advanced BRCA1- or  BRCA2-associated ovarian cancer.  - Entry criteria - measurable advanced ovarian cancer (stage IIIB/IIIC/IV) and confirmed BRCA+ status.

I would think that rads would be still a good tx even if they can't reach all of the spots.  If the rads would knock out most of the spots, that would be less to deal with.  It all helps, doesn't it?  next project is:~TO GET APPT WITH YOUR OWN RAD ONC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~ loveya, c ",

They will probably fit you in the schedule soon for an appt.  Hang in there girl!!!  Lots of good positive thoughts coming your way....picturing white light surrounding you. lotsa hugs xoxoxo, c ",

You have faith in him.  In 1.5 years he has helped you be stable. This might be a node just acting up like nodes do. Don't rule out the possible positive effects of the radiation yet. Tender's idea of taking a picture of this area could be helpful if it shows the growth.  You can email this to your onc's email address and at the same time ask him about the trial that bleiker posted to you about.  Good luck with trying to get thru to the onc.  We are with you in spirit. love and hugs, celia ",

A decade ago I had 2 lumpectomies,both with unclear margins, and so i decided to forego a third lumpectomy and radiation, and have a mastectomy. I had a tissue expander placed a few months after my mastectomy and it failed because it got infected. I was told by the plastic surgeon that i would not be a good candidate for the DIEP because it was such a long surgery, and since i was diabetic this was a bad idea. So i have lived with wearing a prosthesis for the last decade and even though it was somewhat comfortable once it was on, I have always hated it. My other breast is a huge DD and the matching fake boob was way too heavy, even though it was supposed to be a \"lightweight\". I have always felt really unbalanced. The only place i could find to be fitted with a prosthesis and bras had the rudest women working there and they never gave me a good fit. Having only one big natural boob and a prosthesis means wearing higher necklines, and if you bend over, the fake boob pulls away from your body and your incision can be seen. And so i thought that this scenerio was what i would be stuck with for my life. Last month i found 2 lumps in my remaining breast, had a diagnostic mammo, and then the radiologist said that even though they looked like cysts, he said that cysts were \"extremely rare\" in a woman of my age, and he said that i should definitely have a biopsy. I was already reliving the anxiety of waiting and not knowing, but now i was totally panic-stricken that i might have a new breast cancer which might not be DCIS like i had last time. Fortunately, the lumps did turn out to be cysts after all. I watched each one explode and disappear on the Ultrasound screen when the doctor tried to insert the needle in them for removal of a sample. I had decided in my panic state that no matter what happened, i was going to have a prophylactic mastectomy on the remaining boob. I just can't go through another lump scare again. My prophlyactic mastectomy is scheduled for December 4th and i am looking forward to no more mammograms and no more cysts, This will greatly decrease my chance of ever getting breast cancer again, even though there is still a small risk because the surgeon doesn't get all breast tissue cells with a mastectomy. And, best of all, I am especially looking forward to selecting a way smaller size for my prostheses as i don't think i would be comfortable going out in public totally flat.",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2008 09:35AM - edited Apr 17, 2008 09:36AM by celia088 Dawn, I understand your feelings of total frustration. This has become a very difficult time for you with the way everything has happened, plus you and your onc are not really in agreement about how to proceed with your treatment plan.  I do think your fears are taking over.  You said you think things have gone untreated too long to gain control again--i don't think that is true tho.  I think that is your fear and anxiety speaking.  The nodes are the only place so far that have the cancer cells.  Your bones and organs are clear so far. There are (lots) more chemos you can do, so it is too early for you to give up thinking that this is totally out of control.  Part of the problem is that your onc does not want to use the harsher treatments at this time and you are willing to do them so you both are grinding your gears with each other.  You have to have a talk with him about what chemo will be next.  You are trying to decide which is best for you between Gemzar or Navelbine, to be combined with a Carboplatin.  Carboplatin is a good next step.  I think it is time for you to speak with your onc again about your 2nd opinion onc's recommendations.   Your onc is quite stubborn, but he is a good doc.  Try to convince him to try a direction in your tx plan that you would feel better about.  Having patience is the hardest thing in the world to do and none of us are very good at it (especially those with ants in their pants!).  When we are impatient, time seems to move very very slowly and painfully and it magnifies anything we are worried about.  If you recognize this, then you can  put things in better perspective.  The rads are almost over and you will find out soon what they have done, and then on to the next chemo and let's hope this is the ONE that will turn the corner for you. Hang in there, i see sweet guardian angels that are hanging in right there next to you!! love, c ",

      "Content": "Jun 4, 2008 03:35PM - edited Jun 4, 2008 03:36PM by celia088 Dawn!!  From the little that you said here, it sounds like they changed the appointments around to accomodate when the doc will be in. Sounds like he will NOT be in on the day your appt was originally scheduled. But you know what i would do: call the clinic tomorrow and ask them exactly why they changed the appt and did this mean anything more serious?  When i went for my skin biopsy path. report results, the technician had me sit in a room and wait for the doc.  After a while the technician came back in and asked me (while she was wringing her hands together), \"Is there any history of skin cancer or melanoma in your family?  Did anyone ever have any surgery for melanoma?  I totally froze for a few seconds, totally freaking out----and then said to her, \"Why are you asking me this AGAIN, and does this mean that i am about to hear some bad news about my path report?\"   She told me no and just said that the derm doc likes to know that info (which the doc had asked me at my first appt and she had written it down). All of this is to tell you that sometimes the techs make little things sound way too important.  In my case, the tech and the derm doc are both dimwits and really disorganized and they both always upset me because of my anxiety, and my need for concrete actions and answers, and my vivid imagination.   So call and ask them--\"What is the reason my appt has been switched around --is it because of the doctor's schedule? Good luck!!!!!! love and hugs, cgirl ",

I know you are scared and just about anything can look like a bad sign when we are scared.  So please, wait till you get more info on the phone when you call.  It really sounds like they are messing around with the schedule for the doc, not because of something bad.

The node in the abdomen is one more damn node acting up than before. Some nodes have grown and some are new--not news we want to hear.  But i am glad that it is still only in the nodes!! The nodes cluster that is close to the skin is better...? maybe because that way they are more accessible for treatment, and less likely to affect something internal...??  Just guessing tho..... Dawn, doing the Gemzar/Carbo does sounds like a good plan, and hopefully you will hear about the PARP trial soon.  z, i don't know why your journey has been so really frustrating and difficult......i hate these things happening to you.  You are such a wonderful person and mother and there is nothing that you have ever done in your life that would make any of this happen to you---it is just a dealing of the cards of life.  i feel helpless, and i can't even imagine what you must feel.  Please come out from under the bed tho for the chemo.  Every new chemo or med that you try could be the one element that makes you turn the corner.  None of us know what might work, so it is important to GO FOR IT!!! i am here for you in any way i can be, and so many others are too. I am always holding you close in my heart. love and hugs, celia  ps. I am hoping that Tender will come along and hopefully she can explain some of this....",

What does it come from, the chemo working or the rads working? How long does it last? does the tumor disappear? tender, do you know more about this?? i am going to research it, but it would help if you could direct us where to find info.  Thanks!  Girls, lets imagine holding each other's hands and closing our eyes and seeing the positive results for Zar --- fat ugly node tumors shrinking into little, tiny, benign, pastel colored dots.  hugs, celia ",

Shheesh, it took her 4 txs to realize that???  I hate what modern medical practice has become. ok, she said, \"to control the cancer and ease the pain.\"  I am thinking that although she did not expect the cancer to shrink much (it could tho), she may mean that it will keep the cancer from progressing....keep it stable...keep it from getting bigger...and that would be a real positive thing too. Also, getting rid of pain would be very good too and would give you more energy to deal with everything. ok.....take a deep breath.....You have already been thru much harder stuff than this and i know you can HANG IN THERE!!!!!

I was taking care of a really sweet black cat who had been abandoned on my block a few years ago and then again in November when the family he had been hanging out with moved out of this town and abandoned him. I wanted to keep him and bring him inside, but one of my 2 cats is quite crazy and hates other animals.  I have had years of problems with my younger male cat because he is aggressive with my older male cat, so i knew i couldn't take this cat in.  My landlady pushed me into giving the orphan cat to her father's friend, who is a 76 year old man whose cat died after 14 years.  This guy has had thyroid cancer, skin cancer, and now he is battling prostate cancer.  He just finished radiation and he told me that he does not have his usual energy. He said he is tired all of the time right now, but he will get his energy back again, as he did once before when he had radiation the first time.  I hope the cat and this guy get along and this works out. I also have my fingers crossed for you to start feeling like yourself again.  You have been thru a lot with the radiation so you need to rest now.  Like everyone else, i hope you feel better really really soon!! hugs and love, celia ",

A few months ago I had a software crash on my Mac in my email program and i lost all of my email for a year and a half.  I purchased some file recovery software (that i Googled), talked to their customer service people, and tried it several times and was still unable to recover any of the files.  BUT, the one thing i know is that you should NOT use the computer (if it is still usable) to SAVE ANY FILES or MAKE NEW DATA FILES because that can use up the space that the lost files may be stored in. I think i should have hired someone to do the recovery, but i didn't. Perhaps you should find a professional techie to do it. As someone whose 14 year old Hyundai had to have a new rebuilt transmission (ouch!) several months ago (who in the world puts a new anything in an old extinct Hyundai?) because i could not afford a new car payment, i really do feel your pain.   My 17 and a half year old cat had to be taken to the ER for animals today and he will be there overnight on an IV.  They can't figure out what is wrong but something is hurting him.  I am so hoping he will recover as he is my little soul-mate. I cannot even explain how i feel about this..... Dawn, it must be the configuration of the planets or something that is causing all this chaos and despair.  Please hold on, i am holding on too. Dawn this all HAS to get better.  I am taking a few slow deep breaths.  You do that too, ok?.......b-e-t-t-e-r.....b-e-t-t-e-r.......b-e-t-t-e-r....!!!!!!! love and hugs, celia edited to add: BadBoob, that is very valuable information.  I have no idea if it would work with a MAC or not, but i will research it for the future. thanks!!!",

She is nauseous today too. My impression was that the onc thinks she is ok and that nothing is out of order.  He says she can decide if she wants to do the chemo (carbo/gemzar) which has probably been the culprit for all of these side effects, and she has not decided yet about that.   She was exhausted and i think a lot of it was because of the pain meds.  Hopefully, she will rest a lot right now.  I told her who all had posted or given me messages for her.  She was glad to hear them and sends her tired hugs to all! celia ",

I definitely do NOT think you should watch and wait.  I totally agree with LuAnn---you are newly diagnosed with mets and you have not had that much treatment for it yet.  There are many more chemos out there.  I really think you need a fresh viewpoint and a new set of eyes to look at your case--a different onc who is not in your onc's immediate realm.  This is not the time to give up.  Personally I now think your onc is a jerk.

      "Content": "Oct 1, 2009 06:38PM - edited Oct 1, 2009 06:43PM by celia088 Anne,  I have heard different opinions from various doctors on the risk of getting endometrial cancer with Tamoxifen.  The risk of the endo.cancer is supposedly higher if a woman has ever taken hormone replacement therapy, or is obese.  I really think you should have a second opinion from outside of your circle of doctors if you are unsure of what action to take.  Here is an article that i was reading about this issue.  http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/10/991008075836.htm  ScienceDaily (Oct. 8, 1999) \u2014 Women whose breast cancer is treated with tamoxifen face a heightened risk for endometrial cancer, with that risk compounded in women who also have received estrogen replacement therapy or who are obese, according to a study led by University of Southern California researchers. Leslie Bernstein, Ph.D., professor of preventive medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California and USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, and colleagues present these findings in the Oct. 6 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Doctors prescribe tamoxifen, a synthetic hormone, to women as a breast cancer treatment because of its proven benefits for blocking a recurrence of the disease, reducing the likelihood of a second breast cancer developing in the opposite breast and extending patients' survival. It is also under study as a preventive agent against breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease. However, this study indicates the same drug increases the risk of endometrial cancer, the most frequent gynecologic cancer in women. \"Because tamoxifen is a critical therapeutic option for breast cancer patients, we need to understand its other effects on the body,\" Bernstein said. \"Although we have known that endometrial or uterine cancer develops in a tiny proportion of women taking tamoxifen, we have not known which particular groups of women are at greatest risk of this disease.\" Overall, the authors report that tamoxifen therapy for breast cancer increased the risk of endometrial cancer by about 50 percent. The longer women are on tamoxifen therapy, the greater their risk: women with more than five years of exposure to tamoxifen were four times more likely to develop endometrial cancer than women who did not use tamoxifen. But a woman's risk of endometrial cancer also varies according to other characteristics. Factors already known to either increase or decrease women's risk of endometrial cancer include: birth control pills, which reduce risk; estrogen therapy, which can increase risk unless taken in combination with progestin therapy; and obesity, which increases risk. These factors affected the endometrial cancer risk of breast cancer patients in this study. Tamoxifen increased endometrial cancer risk, primarily among women who had previously used estrogens. The risk of endometrial cancer was more than three times higher among women who had taken both estrogen replacement therapy and tamoxifen than among women who had not taken either drug. And among women who had previously been on estrogen replacement therapy, those who took tamoxifen for more than five years were five and a half times as likely to develop endometrial cancer as women who had not been prescribed tamoxifen. The risk associated with tamoxifen use was stronger among heavier women than among thinner women, with risk the highest for women who both were overweight and had a history of taking estrogen replacement therapy. Tamoxifen has been found to have estrogen-like effects on the uterus, which may account for women's increased endometrial cancer risk. Researchers believe obesity may cause greater exposure to estrogen in the uterus, as well. Endometrial cancer occurs far less frequently than breast cancer, and decisions about whether to prescribe tamoxifen should be considered in light of this differential in risk, Bernstein said. In the United States, recent population statistics show that 110 of every 100,000 women develop breast cancer annually. This is five times greater than the rate of endometrial cancer, which is 21 cases in every 100,000 women. Women also are more likely to die from breast cancer than from endometrial cancer. The chances that a woman will die of breast cancer each year are 26 per every 100,000 women in the United States, far higher than the three per every 100,000 women who die each year of endometrial cancer. \"We have confirmed the findings of other studies showing that tamoxifen increases the risk of uterine cancer; and most importantly, we have found that women who have used estrogens and who are overweight have the greatest risk when using tamoxifen,\" Bernstein said. \"Our results suggest that physicians should be particularly vigilant in monitoring tamoxifen-treated patients with these additional risk factors.\" Bernstein noted that the risk of endometrial cancer must be balanced against tamoxifen's proven benefits in breast cancer treatment and its effectiveness in reducing the incidence of breast cancer among women at high risk for that cancer. The researchers conducted the study with 324 patients with endometrial cancer who had previously been treated for breast cancer and 671 similar patients with breast cancer who did not develop endometrial cancer.",

      "Content": "celia088 wrote:     Bristol-Myers Cancer Drug Wins Approval From FDA<> By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN October 16, 2007 5:58 p.m. WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a new chemotherapy drug to treat advanced breast cancer, an agency spokesman said. The drug, Ixempra, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. was approved for use in women who have failed treatment on three other types of chemotherapy. The drug was also approved for use with another chemotherapy drug, capecitabine, sold under the brand name Xeloda by Roche Holding AG, in women with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ixempra was granted priority review status, which cuts four months off the standard 10-month drug review time and is reserved for treatments the FDA deems an advance over existing therapies on the market. Ixempra targets a protein called tubulin, which is needed to help cells proliferate, and is designed to stop cancer cells from growing. The drug, also known by its generic name ixabepilone, falls into a new class of drugs known as epothilones. Shares of Bristol-Myers, which were down 49 cents at $29.24 during Tuesday's regular session, rose to $29.95 in after-hours activity. Over the past decade many drug companies have focused on developing so-called targeted therapies that either attack proteins involved with cancer growth or choke off a tumor's blood supply. Robert LaCaze, Bristol's vice president of oncology marketing, noted that chemotherapy is still the \"backbone\" of most cancer treatment, and he said new chemotherapy drugs are needed to treat cancer that's stopped responding to other types of chemotherapy drugs. While chemotherapy, which is typically administered by an injection or an infusion, kills cancer cells, it also kills healthy cells and has side effects such as fatigue and neuropathy or the feeling of pins and needles or numbness in hands and feet. One of the main clinical studies of Ixempra looked at the drug in combination with Xeloda in patients with breast cancer who had previously been treated with other chemotherapies. About half of the 752 patients received Xeloda plus Ixempra, while half received Xeloda alone. Progression-free survival, which measures time until patient death or tumor growth, was 5.8 months among those taking Ixempra plus Xeloda, versus 4.2 months in the Xeloda-only group. There was a greater rate of tumor response in the Ixempra group. About 23% of patients in the Ixempra reported neuropathy while no patients receiving Xeloda alone had neuropathy. Bristol-Myers is also studying Ixempra for use in treating earlier-stage breast cancer, non-small cell lung, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and renal cancers.     WALL STREET JOURNAL  \"May your heart always be joyful, May your song always be sung, May you stay forever young\"........Bob Dylan Log in to post a reply",
