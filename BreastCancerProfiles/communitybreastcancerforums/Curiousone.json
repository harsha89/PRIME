He did however order a breast MRI which I will have on Thursday. I was told that if the MRI did not show anything we would take the watch and see route. I also learned that as per my prior mammograms I do infact have dense breasts which I did not previously know. What has been some of your experiences with MRI's? Are they reliable, is it odd that he skipped the u/s and went straight to an MRI? Thanks for any input you can provide.",

I am a 46 year young woman (lol) and very active and have implants. My grandmother was a breast cancer survivor and diagnosed post menopause (sp). I had a partial hysterectormy in 1999 due to fibroid issues. In 2007 a lump in my left breast was discovered during an annual exam. Had a lumpectomy after mammo and ultrasound were clear. Results B9 and determined to be fatty tissue or something like that. Ok now fast forward to February of this year (2011) I noticed a lump on the outer portion of my left breast right in the space between my breast and my armpit if that makes any sense, I think its where some of the axillary nodes are. It is a larger lump perhaps better described as an inflammed lymph node type of thing with no pain at all. I didn't pay to much attention to it because I was due for my annual mammogram in March. Needless to say I had my mammo in March and it was all clear and recieved a we will see you same time next year letter in the mail. I guess what I am asking is if I should be worried or not. Has any of you had similar situations and had it be nothing? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and any advise or information you can provide is greately appreciated.

I suspected that this would be the case, neverthe less I learned the following. Very dense breasts, 2 of the 3 areas turned out to be lymph nodes and the third was a very small cyst. The Dr. stated that he did not feel that an MRI was warranted at this time as he did not feel there was anything in his findings which caused him concern. He advised we should wait and watch to see if the cyst gets bigger. I appreciate all who took the time to read and reply. Thank you",

I don't believe the cyst has grown it still feels like a hard round bb with a couple more smaller bb's around it. There is a a weird feeling odd shaped lump/mass that feels almost connected to it or beneath it for lack of a better term. Both the cyst and lump do not appear to move around between my fingers. I'm suspecting its fibecystic changes or scar tissue due to the fact it's in the same area as my lumpectomy (benign) about 6 yrs ago. I have Fibercystic Breast Disorder as well as pretty dense breasts. Sometimes its just hard to tell what to worry about and what not to. lol Thank you again.",

Don't get me wrong, I am elated with this new sense of calm but cant stop doubting myself big time. Have any of you done this as well? Log in to post a reply",
