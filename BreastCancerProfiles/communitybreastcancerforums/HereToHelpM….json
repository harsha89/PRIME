The surgeon said that radiation on the nodes can also cause lymphedema, but Im sure a surgeon has a surgical bias! she said the gold standard was to remove all nodes when the sentinal cant be found.You make a good point though. We are going with a mastectomy for a few reasons, although lumpectomy was an option. Although the mass is small, it's location is behind the nipple, which wouldnt be able to be conserved at all. Her breasts are quite small, so cosmetically, it's a draw. Also, my mother has dense breasts, so finding new growths can be difficult. Third, there is a second suspicious area that a biopsy found to be benign, but in my opinion, the biopsy itself may have had an inadequate tissue sample, and was rushed. We basically want to avoid another surgery, if possible. 2 surgeons said they leaned toward mastectomy, but agreed it wasnt mandatory . Thanks for the thoughtful and detailed response. A lot to think about.",

How you mentioned looking at the tumor characteristics and then deciding how to proceed with lymph nodes. I'm also troubled by not ever KNOWING what is or isnt in those nodes. Once they are out, we could properly stage it, but at what cost? Very difficult choices. Thank you again and I wish you the best.",
