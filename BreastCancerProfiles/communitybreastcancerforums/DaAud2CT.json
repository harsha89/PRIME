    "Content": "DaAud2CT wrote: my wife just received dx of DCIS + HR, in 1 breast. We were told this is non invasive with good prognosis, found via stereotatic biopsy not present anywhere else. She is going for a lumpectomy soon , the issue is that she is on Premarin and has been for a while. We know that she will have to be off that med. She is worried about the effects when she is off it. Though the Doctor mentioned all options with lumpectomy being the one we both agreed on . My wife is now talking about getting a double mastectomy so it never returns then get back on Premarin. I am feeling that she doesn\u2019t need to have that surgery butI know it\u2019s her ultimate decision. I am having a difficult time with this while being loving and supportive .
