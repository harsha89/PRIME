I have very bad nerves about health issues due to a different scare about 10 years ago. My aunt (dad's sister) died of breast cancer 12 years ago (she was about 70, she knew there was a problem and waited a while to get it checked). The tester told me that it is not uncommon for the first one to have to come back and not to worry, but how can I not worry when no one really knows. I keep thinking that what if something has been there for a while and no one knew until this test. Anyone want to talk to me? Log in to post a reply",

But after everything was done and I waited in the room and prayed the whole time, they said that it was tissue overlapping tissue. They did need to do this though because like everyone here said, they need to do it since it is the first one they will need something to compare it to. Kayakgrrl I will pray for you, keep me posted. I identify totally with you though because this was also my first one. I am really glad that they have this site to go to and talk to people like all of the caring women here!!! Thank God for all of you!!! Kayakgrrl, hopefully they will have a radiologist there to tell you right away what the films say, do you know if they do?  ",
