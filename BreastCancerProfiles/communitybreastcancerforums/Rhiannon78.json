Also, the studies were done on IBC and not DCIS, which may well \"behave\" or respond differently. As Beesie points out, I'm still left with weighing my own risk aversion to either a future \"breast event\" or the SE's of the medication.  And since I didn't have rads (my RO felt that it would only cut my already low risk of recurrance-about 5%-to 2.5%, he didn't recommend doing it), the decsion is even more complicated in some way.  I think if I'd have had rads, NOT taking the Tamox would be an easier decsion.  Now I feel that even though the benefit of Tamoxmight be pretty small, in some ways I feel it is my \"only line of defense\" (other than healthy living, which I already do) against a recurrance or preventing the ADH in my left breast from evolving to DCIS or IBC. Perhaps this info will be helpful to some of you. If anyone has other studies or info to share on this topic, please post. Thanks! \"There is a lot of interest in trying to refine which patient will better respond to hormone therapy but in reality, factors predicting response is complicated.This is up to date info onPredictive value of PR refers to how like the PR is going to predict response to hormone therapy. Contribution of PR expression \u2014 The independent contribution of PR expression has been debated [11]. Initial reports, which have been validated through the years, indicated that patients with ER-positive but PR-negative breast cancers have a worse prognosis than do those with ER-positive and PR-positive tumors [12,13]. (See 'Prognostic value of hormone receptor expression' below.) However, the predictive value of PR expression remains controversial, as evidenced by the following data: The early suggestion that absent PR expression would serve to further refine the predictive utility of ER expression for benefit from tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors has not been borne out [14-17]. There is persistent controversy on this point, however [13]. On the other hand, for individuals with ER-negative tumors, the observation that the gene encoding for PR is estrogen-dependent led to the hypothesis that PR expression might serve as an indication of an intact estrogen-ER-estrogen response pathway, and therefore, responsiveness to endocrine therapy [18]. Although some studies suggest that the predictive value of PR is less important clinically as compared to ER [19-22], others have shown that PR status provides additional predictive value independent of ER values [23-25], especially among premenopausal women [9,26]. Like ER, PR was initially measured by forms of a ligand binding assay (LBA), and most of the data underlying our knowledge of the relationship between PR expression and response to endocrine therapy were generated using this assay. Like ER, PR is now measured almost exclusively by immunohistochemistry (IHC). There are some published reports that IHC for ER may be more predictive than LBA in identifying patients who will derive benefit from endocrine therapy, but there are no data addressing this issue for PR. (See 'Antibody-based assays (IHC)' below.) In addition, as with ER, PR protein exists as two receptor isoforms (in this case, called A and B) but these forms are the products of the same gene. These isoforms of PR (A is a slightly truncated form of B) bind with one another to create homo- and heterodimers. There has been little work on the relative significance of these isoforms in clinical tissue specimens and their relevance to clinical decision making, although this is an active area of research. Despite these issues, PR positivity may be helpful in selecting patients with ER-negative breast cancer who might benefit from endocrine therapy [27]. ER-negative/PR-positive tumors are uncommon, but endocrine therapy is usually recommended in this setting, in order to avoid undertreatment with such a highly effective and relatively low toxicity treatment strategy [16]. In this situation it is believed that the ER may be falsely negative. On the other hand, lack of PR expression should not contribute to decision making regarding endocrine treatment in women with ER-positive breast cancer. Guidelines from ASCO and the CAP recommend that both ER and PR analysis should be performed routinely in all invasive breast cancers, and the information used to select patients for endocrine therapy since there is evidence of potential benefit of PR testing to predict response of ER-negative, PR positive patients [1,2,11]. \" edited for typos only",

My breast surgeon didn't see any calcs in the post-biopsy mammo on the left side, so she suggested that with such a tiny area, it may have gotten \"sucked up\" in the biopsy. I think my follow-up MRI will be in October, and another mommo around that time as well.  On the advice of my RO, I di not have radiation, and ultimately have decided not to take Tamox at this time either.  I may change my mind on that front at some point, but for now I am just living my life and find that I do not dwell on this too much.

      "Content": "Feb 1, 2013 01:27AM - edited Feb 1, 2013 01:29AM by Rhiannon78 Hi all: just chiming in as my situation/DX is very similar to the orgininal poster's. I, too was hoping to avoid rads but was open to doing them if my RO recommended them. He did not. In fact, what he said was, if you were my wife, I'd recommend the same thing-no rads. he said if I \"insisted\" (because of being extremely risk adverse, I imagine?), he would do a short course of partial breast irradiation. He even said (in front of my MO!) that he would skip Tamox. She has left the decison up to me, but said that for someone like me, she waffles all the time and said 8 out of 10 times, she'd say to skip it. Bear in mind, this is a large, well-respected facility in Northern CA that has won awards for breast care, and my impression is that they are in many ways very \"traditonal\" ( e.g. Aggessive) when warranted. I consulted with Lagios and he also said no rads/no Tamox. Interestingly enough, Lagios gave me a higher score on the VPNI than my RO did. The way I understood it from my MO was that the VPNI is not more widely used because one must have absolute confidence in the pathology report. i had 4 different opinions on mine. Imcluding UcSF and Lagios, as well as 2 from Kaiser. So I would argue that the trend of no rads for small amounts of low grade, single focus DCIS is becoming much more mainstream, especially when there a high degree of confidence in the path report. Good luck with your decision!",

I have to admit, I still am a bit nervous...I will be having an excisional biopsy on the left in a few weeks (so far diagnosed \"only\" as ADH).  I have to say, if anything worse comes out of that pathology, I will re-think both rads and Tamox, but at this point, I am sitting with this decision to forego adjuvant treatment for a few weeks to see if I am realy OK with it.  I would hate to go through all this again, but like you have previously posted, I feel that if I should get a recurrence or new primary, it will likely be caught very early. The only thing I am still struggling with is having an MRI done.  Lagios recommended that (but he suggested it as a way of avoiding surgery on the left side, and I am far too paranoid to not want to get that junk out and tested!).  My Kaiser docs don't feel that an MRI would give them actionable info in my case, and in fact seemed mostly concerned about false positives that would set the wheels back in motion for additional (and most likely unnecessary) stereotactic biopsies.  But they have ordered it for March once the area has calmed down from the biopsies/surgery (and before the procedure for the left would be done). Right now, my gut feel is to hold off on the  MRI, do the excisional biopsy on the left (the lumpectomy on the right side was very uncomplicated) and go from there. I would love to hear any thoughts on the value of MRI in a case where it appears that I have very small affected areas? By the way, these boards have been invaluable to me, and Bessie you in particual have always appeared to be a well-informed voice of reason.  Thanks!",

The reason that I am confused/hesitating on getting the MrI before the surgical excisin on the left is as follows: 1. MRI was not recommended/done prior to right side DCIS surgery, and as it turned out, it appears that they got it all with wide margins (path report said maximum extent was 4mm). 2. The reco for MRI was made by Lagios after reviewing the pathology from both right (surgical path) and left (stereo biopsy path) primarily as a way for me to avoid a sugical excison on the left. I've already decided that I WILL have the excisional biopsy done no matter what since I would be too worried of something worse lurking there. somthat reason goes out the window! 3. My breast surgeon and RO agreed to order that MRI before surgery on the left, primarily because I pushed them after consulting with Lagios and not because they feel it is in any way necessary, same as they felt about the right breast. 4. Since my right breast will need to heal more before doing the MRI so as to not get everyone all riled up about blood vessel activity leading to false positives, this means I would be putting surgery on the left off until April. Part of me just wants to get it over with! 5. So, in conclusion, while I understand that MRI can be helpful in some cases (as in yours Bessie in terms of UMX decison for what turned out a breast full of DCIS), there is no real reason for me to think it will actually be helpful for me at this point. based on the diagnostic mammo and stero biopsy, they think the extent the ADH in my left is even smaller than the DCIS in the right! So those are the reasons I am hesitant about doing the MRI now, instead of possibly waiting and only doing one IF what is in the left breast is worse than they think it is. That and the out of pocket cost:-)",
