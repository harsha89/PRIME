Now I'm on my 3rd treatment of Taxol.  That didn't go over very well because I had moderate allergic reactions to it.  Not very pleasant.  Have to meet with the onco dr on Monday to determine the course of action.  Has anyone ever experienced an allergic reaction to taxol and does anyone know what other chemo drug they might try and what the SE will be with the next type of drug.  Very discouraged right now because I thought all was well with the taxol. The first 2 treatments were at a slow drip so I handled it very well until the 3rd time when they tried me at the normal drip.  That obviously didn't go over very well with my body!  HELP!!!!",
