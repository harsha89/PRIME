There were several cysts with debris but no solid mass to biopsy. Now I have to wait for my next cycle to have an MRI guided biopsy. Has this happened to anyone? My surgeon hasn't called yet so I'm curious",

I had non mass enhancement and went back for an ultra sound guided biopsy. They couldn't determine which spot it was because I have dense tissue and several cysts. I now am scheduled for an MRI guided biopsy... doesn't that not need to be a certain day? I asked the nurse and she said no. I'm just wondering if anyone ha had one done? Can I drive myself?

Why does the timing mater for the MRI bu not the MRI guided biopsy? Thefirst had to be days 7-12. Mine was on the 12th. Today's was on the 4th day with nothing lighting up. The nurses were talking as if I should feel relief but I'm not. I'm more confused and now worried they missed it today.",
