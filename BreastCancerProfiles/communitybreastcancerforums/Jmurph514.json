      "Content": "Jmurph514 wrote: Hello all.. I have been reading but not posting for a few weeks on this forum. My Mother was diagnosed in the end of January 2012 with metastatic breast cancer. She first had breast cancer in 2003 and had a double mastectomy at that time for a non aggressive cancer. She felt it was her best hope for never having to deal with the big \"c word\" again. She had no chemo or radiation at that time, it was not recommened . 9 years last after developing a hoarse throat in November, and seeing several doctors, she finally had a chest scan done which showed nodules on her spine and lungs. A pet scan 2 days later showed what they believe is breast cnancer metastized to the bones and lungs. She has a small tumor in her throat. So she was started on Letrozole about 2 weeks ago. They confrimed from her old pathology that the cancer is estrogen recepotor positive (and we hope still not aggressive.) So this coming Monday my Mom has a follow up meeting with the oncologist and i was wondering if you all know some questions to ask the doctor at the meeting. I thought this was the best place to start because you are all so familiar with the illness and treatments. She will also be starting a monthly infusion to support bone health, I am unsure of the drug name right now. But this was started becuase the Letrozole shuts down estrogen production. My Mom gets very overwhlemed when she is there so I think its better to have the questions written down.  Any ideas? And questions you wished you had asked? My mom is 57 years old and is otherwise in good health. Thanks, Jackie We are so scared but trying to stay positive! Log in to post a reply",

You are some smart ladies! My mom at 57, was diagnosed with a recurrence of breast cancer in January 2012, 9 years after her first battle (she had a double mastectomy in 2003 with no radiation and no chemo as well as no followup drugs). Her cancer at that time was caught very early and was not that aggressive. The double mastectomy was the most drastic thing she could do and she did it. Last October/ November she developed a very hoarse sounding voice, and after some insistence on my part she went to have it checked out and within 2 weeks of seeing an ENT, wound up at Sloan Kettering having a Pet-scan. As well as small biopsy sugery of the lymph nodes in her neck, but the surgeon did not go to far because he discovered a tumor. The small tumor in her neck was pressing on her voice box and wind pipe. Pet scan showed hot spots of cancer on her sternum, spine and pelvis bones. Since the cancer was estrogen responsive they concluded it was probably the same slow growing cancer from 9 years ago. She is still etrogen +, prog - and HER -. And her lymph nodes in neck and underarms are very sswollen. So she met with an oncologist and has started daily Letrozole and monthly Zometa. That's all so far.( as well as a sugery to get her voice back and also had a pleural effusion in March, that was very scary but permanently corrected). She had a pet scan in may that showed some bone thickening (yah!) and the tumor shrinking. Also tumor marker tests levels keep dropping. And this past week another Pet-scan which showed her cancer was \"stable,\" and her oncologist is pleased! So I'm asking you ladies, how long will this last? How have other experience's been with Letrozole/Zometa. And still no chemo/radiation. I'm very grateful for any info, my Mom is scared to even go on this site because she is terrified if this disease, even as she continues to do well. Thanks, Jackie Log in to post a reply",
