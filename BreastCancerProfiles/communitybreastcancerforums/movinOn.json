I really appreciate your stories and find it comforting to know that you all have had to make some really difficult choices as well. I am going to have the genetic testing on 1/29 and I should have my MRI back next week, so that will definately be factored in before making my decision. I also have an appointment with a plastic surgeon on 1/30 and the answers to my questions will also impact my decision. I'll let you guys know how things turn out! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, god bless each of you.",

My first thought was bilateral as well and was one of my first questions to my oncologist. I am hoping that by doing the bilateral I can forego any chemo treatment since that seems to be what takes so long and would be more traumatic on my family than the actual surgery. I know that I won't find out about chemo until the surgery is done and my lymphnodes results are in. What have you found out about the extensive recovery and risk with diep? I am still weighing all the options and just FINALLY wrote down all my questions. It is a relief to just get it all down on paper. I am concerned about taking care of my kids and being able to do the things that I love to do like running and power yoga.",

I was off pain medication 3 days after surgery, had limited pain, and am healing so well that I'm astounding all of the oncologists/nurses! I'm pretty much 100% back to normal. Now I'm just waiting to hear back from the oncotype dx to see if I'll need chemo or just hormone therapy. We women are SO much stronger than we ever give ourselves credit for! I'm so relieved to have gotten through surgery, I feel stronger than ever. BUT, you may want to check back in with me in another 4 weeks afters I've started preventative treatment!! Love and prayers to all of you!",

The reconstruction and the chemotherapy as well as any other treatment I'll do whatever the Doctor's recommend. I want this to be gone. I am anxious to find out if the cancer is in my lymph nodes or if I am positive for the BRCA gene and if anything else shows up on my MRI. I've read lots of posts, and unfortunately, it sounds like once you've joined the club your life HAS changed and you'll never feel the way you did before diagnosis. I guess it's all in your perspective. I woke up Saturday morning DEPRESSED. I mean, I didn't want to get out of bed or do anything. Thank god for children!! They had no problem dragging me out of bed and asking me what I'm going to make for breakfast and then argued with me about what I was going to make! Life does gone on! It has too and it's up to us to do it with the strength of a warrior. I am so inspired by all of you and your stories and I am GRATEFUL that I have caught this cancer, and that I plan to treat it aggressively. It's been so hard for me to say that I'm grateful this whole time (All 5 days). I mean damn it, I have cancer! But I realized that there are much more serious diagnoses and that I should be happy that my cancer is as small and unagressive as it is. I'll keep you all posted on what happens next. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts and stories with me! Love you!!",

I realize that everyone's preferences and situation is completely different and there is no wrong or right answer, just the answer that you're most comfortable. I got my MRI back and it turns out that I also have DCIS in other areas of the right and they found a shadow on the left breast which they are pretty sure is benign, but in my mind, I'd rather be over and done with this. So I made my decision- bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction on March 2nd. I have an AMAZING team from Dana Farber and it is a relief to have this decision made and to be \"movin on\". Kelty, the decision I made was easy for me because I hate the fact that I need to have surgery and will be too weak to hold and pick up my kids for a while. I don't ever want anything taking away time from my kids. The way I looked at was that I had two beautiful breasts in my 20's and I was able to nurse both of my kids for as long as I wanted, and I cherished that time. But I don't need my breasts to be happy. And, in fact, if I kept the left, I would be constantly checking it and worrying about it. Now, this is just my perspective, and I may be saying \"what was I thinking\" when I'm looking at my new body and battle wounds. The decision is not as difficult if you truly look deep into your heart and make the decision that you are comfortable with. There can be no regrets if you do what is right for yourself and no one else can make the decision for you. You are all beautiful and I truly appreciate all of your advice. I am praying for you all and I am praying for a cure. It's incredible that they still haven't found a way to beat cancer that doesn't require surgery! Let's hope this changes sooner rather than later. My new favorite phrase \"Be good to your self\"!",
