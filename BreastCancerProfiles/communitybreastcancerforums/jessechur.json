Going as close as her mother and her grandmother.  For the past 6 months or more we have been concerned about her shoulder.  She had reconstructive surgery on it 10 years ago.  But for the last 3 months her right breast has been getting larger and larger.  It is anywhere's from 2 to 3 cup sizes bigger than her left.  She has  been having discharge from the nipple and from the discharge it has been making her nipple itch.  She has what feels like a swollen gland or lump at what would be at the 2 o'clock position.  The pain in her right shoulder and breast is so horrible that she hasn't been able to work since the end of December.  At first we thought that it maybe the surgery not holding up anymore, but the more I(we) look at it, its becoming more obivious that maybe we need to look at few othe things.  MRI's aren't really an opition because of the screws in the shoulder.  Any guidence that you could offer or suggestions would be great...Thank you <3 Log in to post a reply",
