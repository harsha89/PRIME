I don't know what  the 1 1/2 hour appointment is supposed to be about. Do I need an extra pair of ears or should I just go on my own? I don't want to go by myself, but I also don't want to make someone sit alone waiting for me. Any advise? Dx 2/18/2011, DCIS, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 3, 0/6 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

The funny thing, they were both in a group meeting last week looking at the slides of my tumor and at that time all 9 on the panel agreed that it was most likely going to need chemo. I am very conflicted about where to go with this in my head. Is this common? doctors saying different things? ",
