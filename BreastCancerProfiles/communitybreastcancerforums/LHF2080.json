Connecting with other women would be great, and so appreciated. While I have come so far and can check many things off my treatment list, there is a long road of future treatments/appointments etc - feeling very overhwhelmed right now. Thoughts/tips? Thank you!",

First off, thank you to all of you ladies for sharing your stories and being supportive, I am thankful there is a place like this for us! I started AC in April and will have my 3rd tx this week, I will be 75% done! Total of 4 dose dense treatments, 2 weeks apart. Is anyone else on a similar regimen? I had chemo in the fall (Taxol,Herceptin,Perjeta) and it was a breeze compared to this! Everything just feels \"off\", at times it is a struggle to leave the house! There is no nausea,mouth sores etc. Probably feeling the lowest emotionally at this point, I am hopeful it is a side effect of the AC or perhaps the steroids- has anyone else experience this? I know there are a million reasons to feel low >bald,bloated,skin changes just to name a few!< but these feelings are something entirely different! Tips/advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!",
