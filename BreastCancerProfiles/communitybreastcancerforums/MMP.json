      "Content": "MMP wrote: I'm writing this for a friend. Two weeks ago she woke up with a painful lump. Friday she had a digital mammogram and u/s. The radiologist told her it 'wasn't good news\", she would require three biopsies, and didn't offer her any explanation for the three suspicious areas other than cancer. He basically made her leave a wreck, convinced she had stage 4 BC with no hope of a B9 result. Three biopsies yesterday, results tomorrow. We know that 80% of biopsies are benign, but what do those results turn out to be? The mass must be solid since an u/s was done, and the lump is 4 cm. Of the other two areas, one came up as calcifications on the mammogram, the other, near her lymph node, was biopsied not b/c of what the images showed, but b/c it was under a very dense area they thought might be hiding something. The doctor who performed the biopsies said the nodes appeared OK on the sonogram. Your thoughts? Was anyone in a similar situation? Thanks for the help. Log in to post a reply",
