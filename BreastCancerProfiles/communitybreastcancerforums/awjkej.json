Have you considered a PET/CT?  If you are diagnosed with bone mets, this is a good diagnostic test to have along with your others.

Stage 4 cancer is being more and more treated like a chronic disease because there are so many ways to approach the cancer.  There is much hope, and much reason for hope today!  I don't want to disregard anyone's feelings b/c believe me, I had my share of panic attacks in the beginning as it is a shock to your very core.  Cancer is now part of who I am, but it doesn't define me.

But if I don't do well on the tykerb/xeloda I can always see if the trial is still available.

So if you do have cancer, and I am hoping not, but if you do, please know that the diagnosis isn't a death sentence.  The treatment that I originally did in 2003 was considered aggressive for me at the time.  Soon after finishing the treatment, they weren't doing it anymore because of the new drugs and treatments found through clinical trials. My cancer is treated like a chronic disease, and my treatments now focus on maintaining my quality of life, and keeping the cancer at bay.  Sending you good thoughts and hugs, Anne",

But the good news is that now I am NED!  So the 2 months were worth it I guess.  I am currently taking 1000 mg of xeloda, 500mg in morning and 500mg at night, one week on and one week off.  I take tykerb 1000mg nightly along with aromasin. On my off weeks, I have more energy, and my hands are not red.  On my on weeks, my hands get red, my face somewhat and I tire more easily.  No lower gi problems anymore, although they weren't that bad compared to the hand/foot syndrome. I use Bag Balm, and Udderly Smooth Udder cream too...all the time.  My onc told me that after 6 months, which is now, I need to watch for a more chronic hand/foot syndrome side effects, as opposed to the acute side effects I was experiencing last Aug.   So I am on the lookout for sustained dryness and cracking of my hands, but so far so good. Hope this helps and good luck with xeloda..hoping it works as well for you as it is currently for me! Hugs, Anne",

As mentioned earlier, the \"T\" drug is tamoxifen which you will take to starve the cancer.  Here is a link from this site with a good explanation of tamoxifen : http://www.breastcancer.org/treatment/hormonal/serms/tamoxifen.jsp Her2/neu status - either positive (to what degree) or negative: Lymphnode involvement - ask your surgeon/oncologist if they will be performing a senintel node biopsy when they do the mastectomy.  Why or why not?  The number of lymphnodes involved factor into treatment as well. Histologic Grade of your cancer (this is different from staging) - The Scarff-Bloom-Richardson system is the most common type of cancer grade system used today. To determine a tumor's histologic grade, pathologists examine the breast cancer cells and their patterns under a microscope. Pathologists closely observe three features when determining a cancer's grade: the frequency of cell mitosis (rate of cell division), tubule formation (percentage of cancer composed of tubular structures), and nuclear pleomorphism (change in cell size and uniformity). Each of these features is assigned a score ranging from 1 to 3 (1 indicating slower cell growth and 3 indicating faster cell growth). The scores of each of the cells' features are then added together for a final sum that will range between 3 to 9. Staging will be determined after your mastectomy as the lymphnode involvement will need to be determined. This may seem overwhelming, but I believe knowledge is power, and this information is the start of a better understanding of your treatment and the more knowledge/information you have, gives you the ability to ask questions. I hope this helps. God Bless, Anne",

I am 47, so I also have \"normal aches and pains\", but it is learning that I could have a pain that lasts 3 days or even a week, and then it goes away.  But it is the panic feeling of what if this means it is coming back that never goes away. The other piece for me is that as LuAnn mentioned there are other options for you...there are other options for me.  I don't take much for granted anymore, but the one luxury I allow myself is to believe that with all the research and advances in treatment, that I will have options for treatment if my current one doesn't work.  With almost 5 years from initial diagnosis and coming from a not so great prognosis, I tell myself that I am going to be around a long time treating my BC as a chronic disease.
