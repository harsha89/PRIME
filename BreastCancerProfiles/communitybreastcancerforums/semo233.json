My lumpectomy was on 8/16 and I met with the oncologist first, 4 weeks later. It was not until they got my Oncotype score back that the treatment protocol was determined and I was referred to the radiologist. The test and resulting score helped determine if I needed chemo, which I don't!! I begin radiation on 10/23 for a total of 3 weeks + 1 week of boost. Best of luck to you!",
