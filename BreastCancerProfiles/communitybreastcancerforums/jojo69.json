I had another thought today that hopefully someone can help me with.  Like I said, I am scheduled for a second opinion with a breast surgeon that was recommended from a friend of a friend.  It got me wondering if there are more area specific threads on this board.  It would be really nice to find other women that live near me & can recommend doctors, pathologists, etc.  Does anyone know if there is something like that on this site?",

I'm also wondering about having lumpectomy then bilateral?  Does it make reconstruction harder?  Would I still do radiation before the other surgery?",

I really bought it for the benefit of my kids (9 &11).  They seem to feel more comfortable with the idea of me wearing a wig. I have a couple of hats too, but I guess I need to get a few more & maybe figure out the scarf thing.  I feel like being proactive about it may make it easier to accept?  Anyway, it's so nice to have support from so many others going through the same crap as I am:)",
