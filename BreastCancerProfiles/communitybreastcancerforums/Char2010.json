I am scheduled for my third round of TC this coming Friday.  And then one more in June, a four week break and on to radiation (and then hormonal drugs as well).  Not looking forward to any of it.  But then what choice do we have?  Have scheduled a fun weekend with friends during the gap between chemo and rads and a vacation for next April.  So when all this gets overwhelming I \"try\" (sometimes it does not work) to think about those plans rather than what is happening with all of this crap. The TC has not been too bad so far.  Both times I have had an allergic reaction to the T but luckily the nurse sits with me when she starts me on it - and has ended up giving me drugs to counteract so I can continue.  Hope the next two go OK as well. Do get very tired on days 5-7 and then start feeling better.  Tough to continue working full-time when you feel so worn out.  Also, drippy nose this time around.  Lost my hair 14 days after round one. Good luck to everyone.  May your treatments go well and may we have this behind us soon.",

So I am new at this but will be happy to share what I have learned so far. Jolanta",
