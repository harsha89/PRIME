The following week I noticed a discharge from my nipple and when I made the doc's appt I saw that the nipple was inverted.  Bad cancer, but lots of clues in the run up to dx - it just didn't cross my mind. When I was really low during Chemo I was alone in a dark room just thinking to myself that I didn't think I could get through this.  It was my lowest point, and in the darkness I heard a voice telling me I could get through it \"you can do this.\"  It was my aunt's voice but she has been dead since 2004.  So I knew that my family over the other side were rooting for me and I had to pull through.

I am glad to see that returning to work is helping, Sue.  And that was a good call, the till. You continue to be upbeat and that does me good, even though there are moments when it hits you again what you've been through.  And chemo isn't exactly a walk in the park, Sue, but is so doable when you think that it is nuking any lurking c-cells.  You've come through so far with flying colours and you'll do the same with chemo.  Big hugs, Valerie S",

I found that two or three days after chemo the tough bits set in.  But by the end of a week after chemo I was okay again.  Water is the secret, I can't stress that enough.  Others drank more than I did and the difference was remarkable - flushing out those toxins must have had a good effect.  Get yourself organised with Immodium and some apple juice - it could go either way and best to be prepared. Your taste buds go a bit haywire too, and I found I had urgent desires for a Burger King Whopper ( haven't eaten burgers in years but this was like when you are pregnant and MUST HAVE - NOW!!) and my local Chinese takeaway did a roaring trade in my need for egg-fried rice and shredded chilli chicken.  Of course some days I couldn't even manage two spoonfuls of soup - the food we wasted because I must have it and couldn't swallow it!  I lost and gained a stone (14 pounds) between treatments for all the cycles. And the odd thing is, when you are well you can't imagine being so down, and when you are down you don't think you will ever be well again, so it really is a roller coaster.  Like after childbirth when all the pain of it is forgotten.  The body is so resilient. You will be given a list of DOs and DON'Ts from your team, and follow them to the letter.  By the time I realised that I needed to drink water I was past the time to take it.  If you need any info on the drugs you can check out cancerbackup.org.uk which explains everything in plain language.  The main message though Sue is that you are going to be OKAY!  If I can do it so can you.  And I can't see any reason why you can't work in the week or so between treatments - the lady next to me used to go to chemo and then go straight off to work on Morrisons' checkout.  My friend's father-in-law went off to the gym.  I'm not saying that's everyone, but it can be a decent run.  And again, those who did better were those who drank plenty of water.  You take things in your own time, but there will be fatigue. Check out the chemo threads on this site, that's where long and close relationships are forged as you go through it all giving each other advice and support.  You can still post here for our love and support, but join with our bc sisters who are sharing your path at the same time.  Just a thought.

I hope you start getting a good night's sleep.  Listen to Shirlann and the rest who are advising you to seek meds to help.  My nurses told me that they weren't looking for martyrs and I took full advantage!! Just let me know if you want to meet and I'll be there.  Big hug Valerie S",

Keep yourself well, Sue.  You will be tested beforehand for any infections and as Valerie Livesstrong says that might delay treatment if your bloods are low.  The chemo lowers your immunity, so you really have to stay clear of folk who might bring colds and flu to your door.  Let your friends and relatives know not to visit if they are unwell.  This is hard, I know, because I love to see friends and family, but my DH was like an immigration official, almost wanting a letter from their doctors that they were fit and well!  I'm sorry to be so doom and gloom about this, but it came from several hours in Accident and Emergency at Warrington Hospital with all the drunks and fighters when I had a temperature that exceeded 37.5.  It took them a few goes before they realised that I needed special attention - didn't want it, but needed it for my survival.  I hope to spare you all that. As for crying Sue, cry as much as you need to.  There's nothing to hold it in for, and letting it go is much easier on you.  We are all sad that we are in this situation.  Our first welcome to a bc sister is to let her know we never wanted her to join our club, nor did we want to join it ourselves, but we have and while one of us is down there are lots of others who can bring us back to smiles with their love and humour.  God bless 'em.  I don't know what I would have done without this board. Big hugs, Sue and Poppy, and all who are on this path and having a hard time right now.  Loving thoughts for everyone. BTW, don't have a right breast anymore, but still have an itchy right nipple.  How's that?  I have found myself rubbing the prosthetic wondering why it doesn't relieve it.  Love and hugs Valerie S",

Ulla, sit down with DH and tell him calmly that the screaming banshee you become is not you, it is the situation.  You are not yelling at him ( even if you are ) but the situation causes you to feel anxious and angry, but it's not at him, it's the cancer.  That's what one of the old hands on these boards advised me to do and it worked when I had the screaming abdabs.  We still recognise when we are angry with the cancer and all. And just remember that they are men.  Even the best ones are ropy when it comes to dealing with this \"inconvenience\" to their lives and plans, so they are on a non-starter really.  Anyway, Karen, I understand your not wanting to go to family and friends with this as it would just be another downer when everyone gets their shawls on to have a gossipfest.  Keep it with us that he is a creep and keep a blithe face on things for the family. Sue, can't believe you are not resting. But didn't expect anything else really. When you stay at home you put on the funniest films or tv programmes so that you are laughing your socks off.  If not laughing, then sleeping. That's what normally happens to me. Well, I am off to work now - that is full time work, Sue, but I am nearly a year out of chemo, not just going through it. You truly amaze me, but I join in with all the others wanting to scold you.  I think chitter chatter Adam is perfectly sweet. Much love and big hugs Valerie S",

I admit that from the outset I was going to work with the chemo, telling my body that the poisons it was taking in were going to be of benefit in the long run.  But I had such a horrid time that no one had to tell me to rest, I was in such discomfort, I could barely do anything.  Wuss or what? Sue, I read that you are not so well this tx.  I was hoping you would be okay, but reading your posts you are poleaxed by this one.  I think you will be joining us on the board today and not going to work.  I can't believe you said \"pull a sickie.\" (ROFL) That has so many levels I don't know where to begin.  \"Pulling a sickie\" has the mental image of colleagues saying \"Oh Yeah - whatever!\" when they hear you are off work sick.  \"Bet she's off around the Trafford Centre getting her Christmas shopping in.\"  I think, perhaps, in this case they might JUST understand the real situation.

When you have your surgery the lab will test it thoroughly and you will have the true diagnosis and this will enable the team - oncologist and radiologist and breast surgeon - to decide your plan of action.  And it will be action - even if that means you actively accept the treatment to get you well again and to stay well.   When I was getting my Herceptin infusion on Tuesday this week the lady beside me was feeling very low and was hating the effects of chemo.  The nurse was so kind and said that the positives were that this awful treatment was actually going to get her through this. And the waiting is the worst of it all.  Everyone will agree with that.  It is a limbo period when tests are all being taken and you seem to spend more time in hospitals and clinics than anywhere else.  Cancer becomes a full time job.  My husband was my bcpa - right it's Tuesday - Warrington Hospital for bone scan - Weds?  Halton Hosp for CT scan - following Tues chemo, Clatterbridge Hosp - Thurs, wig shop!!  Rest only at weekends... I have pm'd you - as you can see I am also in the UK and I have given you my phone number in case you want to have a chat.  I will be gentle with you - you ask what you want, but it's your call Much love and big hugs Valerie S ",

I just got back from London and checked in to see how your results came out and I was a big YIPPEEE for no node involvement and no blood involvement!  That is utterly brilliant news. And then I read on to find you are so down about the triple neg thing.  Please, sweetie, let Shirlann be your guide on this one and don't let it terrorise you.  No nodes is so good.  I had 5 out of 7 positive and also Grade 3 and that gave me nightmares.  So no nodes is VERY good.  But, yes, we have all faced the terror in the early hours when we are so alone.  Just now you are still dealing with the fallout of surgery - it all takes time to recover, don't forget, any surgery is a complete shock to the system - and getting to grips with the science bit of your diagnosis.  When you see your oncologist you will find that his/her plan of action will become the way forward and you will become more optimistic once you are doing something to get you through rather than this awful waiting. My thoughts are with you to cheer you up - you have GOOD news here.  No Tamoxifen or AIs with their dreadful side effects - I'm on Arimidex and feel like I'm 92.  And no receptors on your hormones waving welcome flags for any roving cancer cells to make themselves at home.  Your body definitely has the \"Not 'ere, mate\" signs out.
