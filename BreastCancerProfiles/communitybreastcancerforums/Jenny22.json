I felt like I made it way worse in my mind (did the same with my mastectomy and port placement too). Checked in and had my vitals taken, went back and they accessed my port for the first time. I used Lidacaine an hour before and didn't feel a thing upon injection. The only part that bothered me was the wiping of the area where the port was because it's still sore. Next, they ran the salene, the steroids, and the Benadryl. It was a weird feeling because the steroids made me awake and the Benadryl made me sleepy. I did fall asleep at some point but not for long, maybe 20 minutes? I did have to use the bathroom a million times...just remembered that. After all that, they started the taxol which took about an hour. I felt nothing with that. Finally, the Herceptin that took an hour and a half. Then they came over and flushed my port, monitored me for a few minutes and I was done. I came home and slept for a good 2 hours and so far, am feeling good. Wishing you all a non-eventful first time! I'll have to check back and see how everyone is doing. :) Jen",
