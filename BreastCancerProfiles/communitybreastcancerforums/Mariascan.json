I just got the results an hour ago and it turns out to be fibrodenoma in both breasts but larger in the left. I am quite pleased at the results as it is nothing to serious and he just recommends another ultra sound in 2 months in the mean time he has advised me to stop taking the pill and to use and anti inflammatory when it is painful. I hope this helps.",
