    "Content": "Likesquirrels wrote: This week I had my 2nd monthly blood test because I am on Ibrance. I have been feeling good or say better since starting Ibrance 2 months ago. I have worked hard to bring myself around to normalcy since the crushing news of my cancer 3 months ago. I was feeling good until I met with this doctor who only talked about the negative aspects and outcomes of my disease. I left the appointment crying and a day and a half later, am still trying to pull myself back to where I was before my appointment. I see online that he is the only MD. in my area in this specialty. But I dread seeing him again. I know I'm dying, but isn't the here and now something to value? Especially since I had been feeling good before I saw him. Now my mental state is so depleted. What can I do? I see in his reviews online that others have had similar experiences. I need to keep on this regime he prescribed, but his manner is so caustic. I don't know if I can go through this every month with him. I feel it affected my health negatively seeing him. Doesn't hope count for something? Log in to post a reply",
