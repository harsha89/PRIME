    "Content": "JayD wrote: hi all, new here (obviously). I am 46 and just had my first mammogram on December 31 st. Exactly 8 dayslater I got a letter saying more tests needed by no other information. So, I called the number given and the person I spoke to said the report is requesting a follow up mammogram and that the radiologist would be at the screening to read it immediately to determine if I would need an ultrasound, which they will do right away. I have not heard from my gynecologist at all. Other than the letter that is. My primary care physician however put a note on my account that says \"left breast single nodular asymmetry\". That's all. Does anyone know what that means exactly? Log in to post a reply",
