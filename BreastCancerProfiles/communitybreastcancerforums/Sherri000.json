I did a follow up with the BS and we are all set for the biopsy. It's apparently excisional though I was certain she said incisional initially. It is scheduled on October 18th. The office made me a follow up appointment for Oct.31 and told me that they do not give results over the phone. That is almost two weeks to wait for results. I'm disappointed in that and will try calling after a week to see if there is any way to bump up my follow up or get a copy of the report. I was able to get a bit more information about my microcalcifications. They greatly increased in number from my 2016 mammogram. I was never told about them in 2016 and was never told to follow up in 6 months. They were punctate birad 3 back then and none of this was ever explained to me. So I missed a mammogram in 2017 as I was not under the impression I had any reason for concern. I am disabled and have so many medical issues already and spend so much time at doctors and getting tests done that the mammogram fell through the cracks. I have since moved out of the area I was in 2016 so I have new doctors and radiology. They requested the films and notes from the last place so they could compare. They came up with the birad 4 diagnosis this time due to the increase of microcalcifications, though I was not given a number for how many there were before or now. The area now is about a 6mm cluster with well over 10 microcalcifications but the area is very hazy. They listed it as amorphous and somewhat irregular, grouped. I'm having the excisional biopsy because due to my medical issues I can't turn my head and therefore can't lay on the table required for the stereotactic vacuum biopsy. I have mixed feelings about this as it is a significant difference and possibly for nothing if its b9. But on the other hand, Im hoping that the BS will get a good sample and if there is anything to find possibly she will have gotten enough out that maybe nothing else will need to be done. I don't know if that is realistic of not though. I'm not one of those people who can't stay away from researching. I need to know all of the information. For some that causes more stress but for me knowing the information alleviates my worry. So I've been reading everyone's posts and learning so much. I'm so thankful for everything everyone has shared. I thought I would share a bit too in case anyone searches for birad 4 amorphous grouped irregular microcalcifications. It's helpful to read about other's stories especially if they have similar things going on. Good luck and best wishes to everyone. I will update this after my biopsy. Sherri",

I went in this morning and the wire placement was a little uncomfortable and they needed to add more lidocaine. Overall it was fine. They were having some issues with their mammogram machine and also a little trouble locating my microcalcifications in one of the views so that part of the process took a little longer than I had expected. They moved me up for surgery prep and then we had a little drama. I'm generally a bad stick, meaning my veins tend to run away. I often have issues getting blood drawn or getting any kind of IV. Well, given I wasn't able to drink any water this morning that problem was amplified. It took three nurses and eight sticks before they were able to get any needles to stick. They even tried the backs of my hands and one in my palm just under the base of my thumb. That one was epically painful. The surgery part went without issue and they said they got the microcalcifications so that's as good as it gets. Now the waiting begins. I don't have my follow up with the BS until Oct.31! Almost 2 weeks. I will probably call their office after 1 week and see if I can get an earlier appointment. I'm still numb but am having some pain. I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. Hopefully the pain will be manageable. I have been icing that breast as instructed. I will update again if there are any note-worthy issues or when I get the results.",

I have amorphous irregular grouped microcalcifications that have been labeled Birad 4 (no a, b, or c). I am disabled and have some physical limitations. I have multiple bulging/herniated discs, arthritis in my spine and neck, and Occipital Neuralgia and trigeminal nerve issues. My radiologist recommended a stereotactic biopsy. I had an appointment with my breast surgeon today and, after doing some research about those biopsies, I explained to her that I would not be able to lay face down on the table with my head turned in order to do the biopsy. She let me know that the radiology department that they use does have the type of table where I would have to lay face down with my head turned. They are getting a different type of table but the ETA is unknown. She is willing to do a surgical/ incisional biopsy instead. While I was relieved she was willing to do that, I'm wondering if the surgical biopsy is as precise as the vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsy. Does anyone have any information? I physically can't lay on the table face down with my head turned and unless I want to go to a different center I think the surgical is my only option. I would rather get this all done and over with and I dont have any fears or concerns about having the surgical biopsy. Im not worried about scars or anything. I want to make sure that it's as effective in collecting the specimen of microcalcifications. Should I be worried that I won't have a good enough sample without the vacuum assistance? She explained with surgical they insert the wire with the hook and yank things out basically. I know they will use the mammogram to place the wire. I'm just wondering if the wire will get as good of a sample as the vacuum. Or should I try to find another breast center with a different type of table where I don't have to turn my head.

So it's totally understandable that you want to explore all of this. Unfortunately, from everything I have read and the people I have talked to, there is no clear way to know anything until the biopsy results are in. All the scary words listed still could turn out to be B9. If you are like me and doing the research and asking the questions makes you feel more prepared then keep doing it. But even I reach a limit when the information starts to weigh on me. That's when I know I need to put the mouse down and go about living. So, try not to make yourself too crazy along the way. If it helps, create a document with all the questions you think of to ask the Breast Surgeon or Doctor. Create file folders on the computer or physically and start saving your articles you find, links, information, etc. This sort of thing helps me feel like I'm doing something productive while waiting. My journey started in August and I had my first biopsy this past Thursday. So it has been awhile and I've done a lot of research. If it's B9 that's great. The research I've done could end up relevant for myself or someone I know somewhere down the line. I will find out the biopsy results Oct.31 so now it's a matter of keeping busy and waiting. I had about a 6mm cluster of amorphous, slightly irregular, grouped microcalcifications in the right breast in the lower outer quadrant. I was given a Birad score of 4 (no a, b, c). There was a significant increase in microcalcifications since my previous mammogram at the end of 2016. No one told me then that I had birad 3 microcalcifications and that I needed to go back in 6 months. I missed my mammogram in 2017 and it was basically almost 2 years in between mammograms. I am hoping the best for your mom. Keep us posted. The odds are still in our favor, even with the scary words on the reports. Good luck!",

Your doctor ordered a mammogram and you should have been given one. Period. Call your doctor and let them know you were refused the mammogram. Get a referral to a different imaging center and let the doctor know you will be fighting for that mammogram. If you need to get a new doctor or a second opinion do that. You can try the antibiotics as well and go to the dermatologist but don't give up on getting that mammogram. It's your right to have, especially if your doctor ordered it. I realize a lot of people struggle to stand up to doctors. It's hard when you don't have the medical knowledge. But I assure you, doctors don't always know as much as we think they do. And they are overloaded with patients and are working in a crappy system with insurance. The only one who can stand up for you is you. So even though you are young, you still know your body, much better than anyone else. While we can get ourselves worked up and scared over things, sometimes we are correct. And we will do better to have that peace of mind. The odds that you have cancer at your age is low but not impossible, especially if your family has some cancer. No matter how they treat you, stick to what feels right for you. Insist and fight and go to another doctor if need be. I know its a hassle and wears you down. If it turns out to be nothing serious then you will be relieved and will go about your life. But if it is something that needs to be treated you will be happy you fought for yourself. Good luck!",
