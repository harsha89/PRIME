Not sure if you saw my comment on this post but I am also pregnant so I think that has me even more stressed out. Am optimistic for good results, i AM young, but trying to be prepared nonetheless. Hope you get good results too Nancy, i will update wednesday when mine come back. Thank you for the encouragement Bippy, i will definitely ask for a copy of the reports. ",
