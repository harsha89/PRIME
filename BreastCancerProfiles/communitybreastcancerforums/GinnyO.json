She was here for my surgery and the week after. Then she called me every day, asking how I was and keeping me up with what was happening in her life. It helped me so much! I have a feeling it helped her,also. It is especially hard when you are far apart in miles. You will likely feel better when you see your mom. Then you can deal with how she is really doing and not with what you imagine. Imagination can make things seem far worse than they are. She is so fortunate to have such a wonderful, caring daughter as you! This board will be here for you. Let us know how your mom and you are doing. You both are in my prayers. ",

Even so it would be good to let your MD know of your achiness. If there is no physical cause (it could even be from one of the viruses going around), then perhaps he can help you with relaxation. In the mean time, try to do something that has helped you relax in the past such as walking, yoga, deep breathing, etc.. Share your thoughts and fears with someone, or write them down in a journal. I kept a journal throughout my breast cancer experience. It helped so much to write it all down. Then I felt as if I could let go of it. It really helped to stop the whirling thoughts. Ginny ",
