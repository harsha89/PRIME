I'm ER/PR- and Her2+ so i'v been on Herceptin and Perjeta since then with a lil zometa thrown in every 3 mo. Thankfully they have kept things from progressing any further at this point.",

I am also Her2+ so Herceptin was on board as well for a year. I thought all was well and was reaching my 5 year mark In March of this year they found that I have a \"mass\" that they confirmed was mets to my ovary/bladder w/acities to my abdomen/lungs. I did go with 6 rounds of taxol/carboplatin/herceptin and now I am on herceptin/perjeta/zometa for as long as it works. I am finding it to be a strange reoccurance and little to no info about how this progression works. The onc says he makes no promises after 2 years but, right now I feel pretty good.

As I said, I do feel pretty good and I surely feel and plan on much more than 2 years. I know there are always new treatments and I am open to any they want to throw my way. I had always said I wanted to live to 100. I may not get there but, i'm gettin' as close as i possibly can.",

They responded with \"where do you live and what insurance do you have\" At that point I explained I was on disability and my health care at present was medicaid. The response was, \"I'm sorry we can't help you but, we can direct you to someone in your area\".  Wow, I thought. All I needed was some information about a new drug. If you don't have the right insurance OH WELL, not even information!",
