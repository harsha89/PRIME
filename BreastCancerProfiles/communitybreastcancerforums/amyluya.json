I had terrible pain in my hip, could barely do anything, and then had to start radiation to control the pain before I could start chemo. This summer has been one of the best of my entire life. I have been able to spend most of it with my 8 1/2 year old son, playing catch, watching him play baseball, running around, going to every mini-golf course in the area that we can find, etc. etc. I worry, somehow, that I have had too much fun. That somehow my pure enjoyment with my son is a foreboding of sorts. It seems impossible for me to escape that kind of thinking. Still, I stay hopeful most of the time, and many times I can actually forget (especially since I am on a break from chemo currently). I do have my next scan this Friday, though, and I have begun to have some pain in my right hip recently, so I am worried that it has begun to spread again. Still, there's not a darn thing I can do about the outcome, so I just try to live every day for my son, so that he will always know that I love him, support him, and cheer him on!",
