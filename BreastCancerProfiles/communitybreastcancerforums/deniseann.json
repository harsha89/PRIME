I'm happy to be D2 if that makes it easier for all -- my sister is a Diane, so I've been pretty much D2 forever...  Thanks, Kimberly, I will check out this fromthe beginning.  Once again, I am a newbie to both cancer and blogging (is that what we are doing?) Suz, I just read your last note -- I can't imagine we will ever be over what we are going through...everything that happens to us affects who we are and who we will become.  I wish I had answers for the depression, but hope you know that you will come out on top and conquer this!  In a way -- and I know this sounds odd -- it seems like it could be a letdown to finish the chemo.  What's next?  Why are we cured? We have gone along and done all we are supposed to do, and I know I want to be cured and 100% back to normal the day after my last chemo.  Probably won't be like that, eh, girls?  But hang tough, Suz, you're on your way!",

I'm 49 with no history of any cancer anywhere in my family...I found a lump in my right breast after getting hay down my bra (horses and goats).  My last mammo was 5 months overdue (17 months)Diagnosed Nov 07 with 4 to 5 centimeter tumor, invasive ductal carcinoma (does that sound right?) Estrogen positive, but had not spread beyond the breast.   I had 2 lymph nodes biopsied (negative), three breast biopsies plus a skin punch for inflammatory (negative) I did not read up on all the things I could have on the WEB, but my husband has and I just didn't want to terrify myself... I joined a clinical trial with Taxotere plus Xeloda for the first 4 treatments -- I just had session 3 yesterday.  Then  I will go on to another PET scan then on to more drugs -- Tax plus cyt?  I see that some of you have talked about se etc.  Can we ask not to have the steroids?   I hate the bloating constipation, etc.  It's miserable, plus the no sleeping.  No wonder they say we'll be fatigued!  Yuck!  I am a very outdoors person -- as I related in my discovery of the tumor =] -- and hate being tied down and feeling crappy... I've been reading til the cows come home, or in my case, the goats and horses... just feel like a slug.  Sorry to gripe so much, but is there anything you guys can suggest? I did find two things that have helped -- one is paperbackswap.com where you can get credits by mailing your old paper backs to other members and get free books in exchange.  The other thing I have signed up for is a \"look good feel better\" class for makeup tips, etc.    I mean, what earrings go best with bald?  What shade  of lipstick flatters pale and puffy?  These are critical ?'s, eh, ladies!?!? thanks for the chance to vent -- xoxoxo denise",
