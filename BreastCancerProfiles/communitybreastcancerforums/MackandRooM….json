This was my 4th biopsy this month, but my first stereotactic. I can give you some current, live as \"it's happening to me\" experience advice as a mom of 2 ridiculously energetic kids: accept help. You will be sore. You will be emotionally impacted as well, which is more exhausting to me than anything else, really. You are not to lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk. Stick to this, firmly. REST! You will be sore, you might have some bleeding from the site or nipple. Let your dr know about anything that seems excessive. I currently do not have any bleeding (at hour 10), but I haven't moved much in 6 hours, so maybe that's a factor :) Utilize the ice packs. They really do make a big difference. Take the Tylenol, it might help. It doesn't do much for me due to my super human ginger resistance to anything less than Demerol, but you might want to do it. Do not feel the need to push. It's best if you let go of your responsibilities, which as a mommy, I know it's difficult, but you need to care for YOU right now. It's ok to do that, I'm learning. Hydrate and eat prior!! I didn't do either and was wicked dizzy after the procedure. It's no bueno. I did score some lovely apple juice after the procedure, though, so not a totally bad deal. I'm new here, and to all of this, and I, for self-preservation purposes, say most things with some sprinkled humor, even if it doesn't seem like the time. I hope my experience help you in yours. You've got this, lovely lady. You're going to be awesome  ",
