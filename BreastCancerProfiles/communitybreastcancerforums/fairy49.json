I think it depends on the hospital, for mine,I went to admitting at the hostpital where I did all the check in stuff, I was taken to a room to do the pre-op stuff, then down to surgery and then to recovery then back to a different room, hope this helps! Best of luck on Jan 8th! Lorraine ox",

Someone said to me the other day, Gosh I am so sorry you are sick! I said to them, but I am not sick! They looked puzzled, but I don't think I am, I don't plan on being, I am taking care of it the best way I know how and moving on.  God bless everyone of you, I am wishing you Happy Holidays!  Lorraine ox",

I had my bi-lat with immediate tissue expanders on Oct 29th, I was told not to move my arms for two weeks, I am sure everyone's plastic surgeon and breast surgeons will offer different advice but mine was firm about not moving my arms so that the tissue expanders didn't slip, as it turns out I had to go back in for another surgery 3 weeks after as my right tissue expander slipped, my PS said that as I was right handed I may have put pressure without realizing it, I think I was an exception rather than the rule.  I couldn't imagine doing the laundry, however my laundry room isn't too close and their are a few staircases to climb! I was lucky enough to have my mum come in from England and she took care of me for a few weeks.  My advise, if possible, would be to have friends help with as much as possible and try to rest.  I had a lot of button up extra large shirts as you can't lift your arms to put on tops and tanks or anything like that.  also I got some foam wedges from the medical supply store that I used to prop me up in bed as I couldn;t lay flat, its been so comfortable that I still use them LOL!!  Best of luck and keep us posted, bigs hugs and prayers to you!
