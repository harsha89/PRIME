      "Content": "sunnySTS wrote: I'm 38. My doctor casually mentioned I should get a mammogram because of family history (paternal aunt). I got a 3D mammogram last week. They called Wednesday to say there's a mass. I went back this morning and did another 3D with different paddles. The doctor looked, but then wanted an ultrasound. I did that and the tech brought the doctor in to tell me they found two nodules next to each other. One is a cyst, one is solid.  They want to biopsy the solid one next Wednesday. I didn't ask what kind of biopsy (I didn't know there were differences). I guess, I don't care what kind of biopsy. The kind that tells me what this is, I guess.  They said I'll get results in 2-3 days, so maybe by next Friday. They also said most solid findings in breasts are not cancer.  The wait is going to be hard, but I guess what I'm struck by is how very, insanely quickly I feel turned upside down. I want to quit my job 20 years (I won't). I want to change everything I'm doing (and I'm generally very content!) I want to scream. I want to cry. I want to feel normal. I want to not pretend I'm not scared around my husband. I feel nuts.  Log in to post a reply",
