The side effects build up over time so I had nothing except towards the end. The slight nausea was easily controlled with Odansetron and the joint pain did not show up until the one year mark. I started to get some slight neuropathy towards the end but nothing like when I was on Taxol! Unfortunately I am HER2+ and my cancer came back in my lymph nodes so I was taken off Kadcyla and put on THP which failed to work also. Wishing you all the best and praying that Kadcyla works great for you! Barb",
