      "Content": "Jan 31, 2008 04:08AM - edited Jan 31, 2008 04:15AM by cheekymonkey Hi Angel, Could I ask you ....Did you have any other symptoms when you were diagnosed?  My sister is going through a recurrence, but her scans don't show anything except pulmonary nodules. She also has a skin rash on her chest, and SEVERE chest pain. Did you have any of these things? She has also had a large pleural effusion that she had to have removed by thoracentesis. And they checked THAT for cancer cells, and it came up negative. However, in her case, she was also diagnosed two years ago with a fungal lung infection(Histoplasmosis), so we are trying to figure out exactly what is going on. It's all so frustrating! We appreciate any help that you can give us by sharing your information from your diagnosis. Thank you! mitzi ",
