I just wish more members would post if they had these symptoms.  I have also heard that some radiation onocologist just won't admit that radiation could cause such side effects afterwards. It seems to be the nature of the beast in a manner of speaking, no pun intended ofcourse.

He was able to review the ct-scan because I have had all my care done at one facility.  He ordered a bone scan to ease my concerns.  The bone scan being as sensitive as it is, showed one tiny \"spot\" on my rib but this spot did not show up on the ct-scan. Scans are great but they can also open up a can of worms...in manner of speaking. To rule out anything bad (since the report was very vague) my rad oncologist physically walked (not called) over and followed up with the radiologist who read the bone scan.  Long story short... in the end my rad oncologist had the senior radiologist along with the radiologist(he's new at the hospital) who originally read the scans review my bone scan again along with my rad ongologist and came to the conclusion that this one tiny spot is probably from trauma (I pray that are correct) and am having a repeat bone scan again in March to ease my anxiety. Basically, my rad oncologist is a godsend and he has answered so many questions I needed answers to and I don't know what I would do without him. Good luck in making your decision.",

Having a 3 cm tumor is a very large tumor when it comes to breast cancer and being her2+++ makes your tumor VERY agressive.  I recall reading that a her2+ tumor is very seeky and likes to set up shop elsewhere.  Even if you are node negative, cancer cells can enter the blood stream bypassing the nodes.  Usually the larger the tumor the greater the chance especially being her2+++.  You had mentioned that you are going to see a homeopathic doctor, I have several physicians in my family including 2 naturapathic physicians that are trained as homoeopaths, chinese medicine and hold masters in accupuncture and both graduated from Bastyr in Washington. The naturapaths along with my other family members who are regular physicians advised me to seek out several opinions regarding treatment after we learned I was her2+.  And I also see another naturalpath who specializes in women's health and treats alot of breast cancer survivors, after my naturalpath learned I was her2+++ she instructed me to do what my oncologists told me to do for treatment and not to gamble and to come back after I was done with treatment for a treament plan for secondary preventation.  I am speaking to you as a mom speaking to another mom.  You are a very young women with 3 children and I understand that you may not want chemo/Herceptin in your body but don't you want to do everything possible to insure that you will be there for your children?  Natural medidnce has it's place but it doesn't cure cancer. Please visit the her2 website with is an excellent resource for those who are her+, it's www.her2support.org.  Please research your options thoroughly.  Wishing you the very best in your decision making.",

This does help to take the edge off the pain. The anti-inflamatory (Motrin) is supposed to help bring the inflamation down and help my body to heal. At times I'm short of breath and can't take a deep breath but eventually do catch my breath. I have been examined by a few doctors regarding this and the concensus is costochondritis. They did an oxyen saturation test which came back normal.  Last week my oncologist did a CT scan of my chest just to rule out anything else, thank God everything came back fine. My radiation oncologist also reviewed my ct scan pictures on the computer himself and said that it is a possibility that radiation could have helped to bring this on but that everything on my scan looks great. I do feel better that 2 different doctors (radiologist & radiation oncologist) actually reviewed my ct films. My questions is for those who had costochondritis; what brought it on, how long after radiation did you experience these symptoms, what were your symptoms, how long did they last and how were you treated for it?  Your input would greatly be appreciated.  Thank You.

All the sudden I would feel extremely anxious and overwhelmed, I felt like I would enter the twilight zone (I was probably having an anxiety attack). Fortunately this horrible feeling passed after a couple of weeks.  I have 3 young children and I too found myself snapping at them pretty often.  It's normal and you will get passed this point just like the rest of us.  I was prescribed Lorazepam 1mg.  I cut the tablet in 1/2, so I would take .5mg as needed (once a day or sometimes a couple of times during the week).  I would suggest that you take it only when clairly needed since it is habbit forming and only when you don't have to drive.  As far as sleep, I would occasionally take Benadryl (the generic version) and that would help me.  Actually I would rotate the meds sometimes.  Sleep is a very important part of keeping our nervous system healthy. Wishing you the very best, Liz ",

Good luck, Liz ",

You did comment that  the nodes have been swollen since the biopsy which may mean that they are reacting to trauma such as the biospy otherwise known as \"reactive hyperplasia\".  Lymph nodes can swell from a tiny cut or even from shaving under the arm because they are very sensitive and it's their job to fight off infection.   I just found my \"post biospy instructions\" \"no heavy lifting or strenuous exercise for 24 hours, otherwise, you can resume normal activities after this procedure.\" As far as exercise, verbally I was told it was OK  to exercise (I did running, walking and hand weights) but told  to wait a few days after the biospy.  As Shirlann said may be Beesie can answer some of this better.  I had a hard time with my lumpectomy which I had back in February and am still having alot of pain but everyone is different. Best of luck.",

I had to stop my brisk walks for a while.  The severe pain lasted for almost 2 months and still hurts somewhat but has much improved and continues to improve.  I was told to take Motrin every 6 hours around the clock for a couple of weeks and my naturalpath also suggesed that I add a supplement called Zyflamed which helped alot.  After having cancer we all like to worry, it's the nature of the beast. As Shirlann has said in many of her posts....breastcancer....the gift that keeps on giving.  Hope you get some relief soon.  Liz",

If you mammogram and ultra sound come back with nothing, you may want to consider a breast MRI, especially is you have dense breasts to ease your mind. Wishing everything comes back 'BENIGN\" .",

In nearly all situations, surgery does not cause cancer to spread. There are some important exceptions, such as tumors in the eyes or testicles. Doctors who are experienced in taking biopsies of cancers and treating them with surgery know how to avoid the danger in these situations. The chances of a needle biopsy causing a cancer to spread are extremely low. In the past, larger needles were used for biopsies, and the chance of spread was higher. One common myth about cancer is that it will spread if it is exposed to air during surgery. Some people may believe this because they often feel worse after the operation than they did before. It is normal to feel this way when you start to recover from any surgery. And sometimes, no one knows that the cancer has spread until it is seen during surgery. Because of this, some people may link surgery with widespread cancer. However, cancer does not spread because it has been exposed to air. If you delay or refuse surgery because of this myth, then you may be harming yourself by passing up effective treatment. But can't find anything on exercise.",
