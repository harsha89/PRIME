At 3 am this morning felt twinge in left breast, slight pain behind right knee, and was very tired.   I am not complaining; it is really not bad at all.  I think it is good that we let each other know what might be expected.  All knowledge is good.  Perhaps it means the Neulesta is doing it's job! I still have not written my data about my case so that you could know what I am on, etc.  I hope to get to it in a few days.   Keep on posting....others are interested and I find it a good way to vent to people who understand.  I am 76.  Hubby is 79 and not as sharp as he used to be.   He does not understand what I am going through now.  Says I had the surgery and that took care of it.  Thinks I take too many meds and that is not good!  He also keeps asking if I have any more appointments or are they \"done\".  This from a very caring and good husband who is going through his own trials of aging.  So, I really don't have a good support person at home with me.   Thanks for listening.   Mor",

Just opened a bottle of Pelligrino, and that was \"off\" also.  Has anyone else had a problem with water?",

Starting tomorrow our local library is having meditation classes.  I think it might be good for me, teach me how to relax.  I take Ativan for sleep.  Take it between 9:30 and 10:00.  Takes 45 to 90 minutes to fall asleep.  Up around 12:30 to pee.  Go right back to sleep....then up again for another pee around 3:30 or 4:00.  At this time, I usually have a bowel movement.  Then I am awake for the day.  I have never been a good sleeper so this does not surprise me.
