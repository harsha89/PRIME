Basically a group of ladies come in and clean up your place for you while going through chemotherapy or radiation and I think they do it for no charge? Anyway, my point is that while they were interviewing one of the women that does the cleaning she was saying how gratifying it was to see how she was able to help the cancer patients and then........ went on to say the tough part is that some of the clients don't survive their cancer. I immediately thought of my mother who is going through stage 4 breast cancer right now and immediately lost all hope and got really depressed, although things seem to be going okay for her.

      "Content": "raccoony wrote: Well, actually it's my mother. She was diagnosed almost one year ago at stage three with invasive ductal carcinoma which was er+ 95%, pr+ 5% and her2 3+. She had a lumpectomy, at which time they discovered she would need a mastectomy. So, they went back in at a different date and did one. Five months later she started having shortness of breath, ascites (turned up the fluid was malignant), indigestion and vomiting so she went to the hospital and discovered the cancer has metastasized to her liver and abdomen. The liver sounds common, but the abdomen doesn't. I asked the new oncologist (we decided to transfer her to siteman in St. Louis and we're lucky to live so close to it) about the abdomen mets because I thought that was a feature of lobular as opposed to ductal and he said normally that's the case but because she is her2+, is certainly is possible. So, the first oncologist got her started on a treatment at the first hospital stay when they discovered it had spread. He gave her perjeta, herceptin and taxotere and she went home the next day. She got diarrhea so bad that she was hospital material once again a week later. At this point I said mom we're going to barnes and getting you into siteman. She was there for two weeks and got out yesterday. They had to pump her full of fluids and get her back on track and took really good care of her. We have high hopes for siteman and are staying very optimistic. One of the main reasons we switched from the old oncologist was because he told her she wouldn't survive this and gave her six months to live. It sent alarms off in my head and I talked to my boyfriend and did some research and we decided on Siteman. I would've loved to have taken her to caner treatment centers of america but on medicare, you have to live in the state of the facility or start an account with them of $250,000 out of pocket otherwise. A**holes. Anyway, I've been scoping out this site for a while and it's the main reason I have hope for my mother. A lot of people focus on the negative with cancer and never speak of the miracles.    MOTHERS DIAGNOSIS BELOW, NOT MINE Dx 12/2011, IDC, Stage IV, Grade 3, 9/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Surgery 12/9/2011 Lumpectomy: Left Surgery 1/19/2012 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left Targeted Therapy 9/9/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Targeted Therapy 9/9/2012 Perjeta (pertuzumab) Chemotherapy 9/9/2012 Taxotere (docetaxel) Log in to post a reply",

I must say, I get really upset and down when I hear all the breast cancer sh*t saying \"Early prevention is keeeyyyyy\".. It's like, well guess fu****g what, we didn't catch it early so f**k you!

She goes in Friday for second treatment. Ofcourse she's a little gunshy from the reaction of the first treatment but he said some dosing adjustments would be made. ",
