      "Content": "Mar 6, 2018 05:20PM - edited Mar 7, 2018 05:59PM by LisaCincy Hi ladies, I had my BMX/SN/Immediate reconstruction (direct to implants) surgery 6 days ago. My recovery is going fine. I was sent home on Thursday (my choice; I could have opted to stay another night) but I was eager to get out of the hospital. My husband took care of me for the first 4 days at home and then my parents arrived yesterday. They planned to stay through Friday but after seeing how well I'm doing, they are planning to leave tonight ahead of a snowstorm. Here's my journal so far: Wed 2/28 6:15am Arrived at the hospital for my nuclear injection. I had BC in one breast and the technician drew an imaginary line that divided by breast into 4 quadrants around the tumor site. Then she injected a painkiller into each quadrant followed by the nuclear dye. She repeated that for each quadrant. Was it painful? Yes, for maybe 2 seconds. But she had me doing some breathing exercises each time and it was honestly not a big deal. Then they scanned the area to make sure that the dye was spreading, and that was that! Afterward, I dressed and walked to the next building to check-in for my surgery. 7:30am Was taken back to my pre-op room and asked to change into my surgical gown. The nurse asked some questions (had I taken my high blood pressure medication? had I avoided food and drink after midnight?) and then received a series of visitors. The BS arrived and used a permanent marker to mark me for BMX and SN removal on the right side. The PS arrived and drew a whole bunch of lines on me so that my implants would be symmetrical. The Pain Management team arrived and we decided on an Epidural that would block the pain from my entire chest wall. Shortly thereafter, I was given a sedative and my husband kissed me goodbye. I went right to sleep around 8:45am and was not lucid until I woke up again 6:00pm Woke up in recovery, nauseated. Was given Zofran, which helped immediately. My husband was there but my parents had left without seeing me because they hadn't eaten all day. The surgery last an hour and a half beyond what was expected. Apparently, the BS couldn't find my lymph nodes because they were so small (good sign) and that took some time. Plus she's known for being very thorough. I was groggy and my entire chest was covered in gauze and a surgical bra. My mouth was extremely dry and I kept asking for ice chips, but I was in no pain at all. After an hour wait, they found a room for me and wheeled me upstairs. I had a light dinner (tapioca is all that i can remember eating) and started drinking water like a sailor. I was also hooked up to an IV (not through my port), which was oddly put into my right hand. That was very inconvenient because I couldn't type on my phone easily. If you have an option, ask for the IV in your non-dominant side. I was also catheterized, so no need to get up and pee. The epidural pump was still in and remained in throughout the night. Also, had one drain coming out of each side, collecting fluids. These were emptied and fluid amount recorded, along with my urine, throughout the evening and night by the lady who took my BP and pulse every 2 hours. It took through the night before my saliva started being produced again. I almost choked a few times on my sandwich because I couldn't swallow without water. My husband stayed the night with me, though I didn't need his assistance. Got more Zofran for nausea sometime in the middle of the night, even though I was only mildly sick because there was no way I was going to let it get so bad that I'd risk throwing up. Also was given Benadryl as I started getting a serious case of the itchies. Thursday, 3/1 6:00am Catheter was removed by the Pain Management team and I was instructed that I had until 2pm to pee or they'd have to do a scan on my bladder/kidneys to make sure I wasn't blocked up. I ordered a breakfast of bagel and cream cheese and fruit. Once again, nearly choked on it because absolutely no saliva. Not sure if that was from the epidural or the surgery. Made good use of the lip balm. Drank, drank, drank water so that I could pee. Got up and walked the ward with my husband for 10 minutes, as instructed. I had very limited range of motion in my arms and it would have been very difficult getting in and out of bed if my abs weren't in good shape from having a temperpedic bed. Ran into the Pain Management team in the hallway and she took out the epidural from my back as I stood there. 8:00am Walked the hallway again. Was able to pee. Yeah! Took a nap. Visited by the PS team, and they inspected everything. 10:00am Walked the hallway. Was shown how to clean out drains by the nurse and we got an A+ on our exam. Noon At lunch and took my first round of oral pain medication (Oxy). Made me immediately sleepy. Was visited by my BS, and she said everything went well. Was asked by the nurse if I wanted to stay another night in the hospital or be released that afternoon. The latter, please! 2:00pm Was seen again by my PS team and okayed to be discharged. 4:00pm Dropped off prescription and arrived home. Husband picked up the prescription while I napped. 6:00pm My friend arrived with dinner. Ate, drank, then settled into my recliner til bed time. Took pain medications and my husband prepped the bed with cushions and a reading pillow. Slept like a zombie, waking only to pee. Friday 3/2 and Saturday 3/3 Settled into routine at home. Ate normally, took my medications, walked around a bit and managed the drain. Also showered each morning, as this was okayed by my PS, as long as I didn't scrub at my incision or anything. Chest feels very numb still, almost like I'm wearing a life jacket, and is still graffitied up with the PS's drawings. No way am I touching the stitches. Drains are well over the 30ml daily that I need to get to before they are removed. Was able to wear normal XL sleep shirts by slipping my arm out of the sleeve and pulling it over my head without raising my hands above my head. No need for all those button down shirts I'd purchased. Sunday 3/4 Switched from Oxy to Ibuprofen. Started doing limited range of motion exercises. Walked about a half mile. Drains are still well over the max needed to remove them. Monday, 3/5 Parents arrived. Played cards. Started feeling some pain in the evening, so I took an Oxy before bedtime. Ditched the bras as they were pinching the drain lines and making me really sore. My biopsy report posted online. I knew it was going to be good because they wouldn't have posted it had it not been good news. They found no evidence of cancer anywhere in my removed breasts or lymph nodes. I'm officially nT0 and nL0 after treatment. Woo hoo! That will undoubtedly mean that my treatment will be concluded after my implant follow-ups because I'm TN and there's no targeted treatment for me to be on. Tuesday, 3/6 Back to Ibuprofen. Getting more range of motion. Walked a half mile. Chest is feeling less like an alien creature. The implants are more natural looking and less pinched. Drains are capturing less and I'm hoping that they'll be less than 30ml by tomorrow so that I can hopefully get them removed on Friday when I visit the PS. I'm doing well enough that my parents are planning to leave tonight ahead of the snow storm.   ",

I woke up in a surgical bra and slept overnight in my hospital gown, so all I needed in terms of clothes was: underwear, pants and shirt. For the pants, make sure it's something you can step into without bending over too much, such as sweatshirt. For shirt, it helps to have a front-button shirt, although I quickly learned how to put on baggy regular shirts by pulling one arm out and then pulling it over my head. The other items I'd recommend are: phone, charger, lip balm, and pen (for writing down things). I wasn't there long enough, or lucid enough, to need music or movies or books.",

It worked almost instantaneously. I get motion sick sitting on a porch swing, so I was worried about nausea. Linda, I also had a BMX with immediate implants. Surgery lasted almost 8 hours. I'm now 16 days past the surgery and recovering very well. The surgery itself was a breeze, thanks to great drugs. The recovery has been slow but steady. I've been able to get up and move around since Day 2. Not being able to reach high things or carry heavy things were my biggest challenges at first. Now my challenge is to get used to the new implants. I'm still very aware of them, and so it's difficult to find a comfortable sleeping position. However, every day I get stronger and less sore. It's a big operation, but quite doable. Good luck, ladies.",

What a relief to get them out! Afterward, went out and celebrated afterward with friends and family. Had my first glass of wine in an eon. Met with my PS NP today. All is looking good. Was surprised to discover that I was supposed to be given an antibiotic after surgery. Well, I'm glad that I didn't get an infection! Also turns out that my PS recommends that I wear a compression bra for the entire 6 weeks of recovery. That was not made clear in the instructions and I had switched to a softer bra with less support. She said that the compression helps reduce swelling and helps the new boobs settle into place. So back into compression I go. She also confirmed that no swimming, bathing, hot tubs, lakes or oceans until after I'm cleared at 6 weeks. Boo. Was hoping to go to Florida in 2 weeks for some sunshine. She gave me a referral for PT which I will hopefully start next week. Need to work on strengthening all the muscles and to try to get rid of this knot in the middle of my back that has been plaguing me since surgery. I think that my body isn't used to the weight of the new boobs. I'm glad that I'm slowly getting used to the feeling of the new boobs. At first they were very alien feeling and I was getting a tad claustrophobic. I think it'll be easier when all the swelling has gone down, too. Feeling sore, but getting less so every day. Have been alternating between Tylenol and Ibuprofen as needed, which isn't very often.",

I had neoadjuvant chemo so I'm done with all the major treatments unless I get bad news on my biopsy. Crossing my fingers and toes. The Pain Management team gave me an epidural for my BMX. I was in absolutely no pain for the first day. Real pain came after they removed it, and I think today is the worst it's ever been as I'm counting the hours until my next pain pill. Each day after this is supposed to be better, so that's a relief. My chest is extremely sore and numb, and it's very odd to see that implant in without any feeling associated with it. I guess that's how it's going to be moving forward. I resumed a normal diet the night after my surgery. What I took to the hospital: Lozenges I thought I'd packed safety pins for the drains but no go. Other than that, that was all I really needed.  ",

My advice is to breathe and try to take it one step at a time. I've never heard of Grade 4 (I've heard of Grade 1 to 3), though it may be because they changed how they stage BC in 2018. Your doctors will know a lot more after your next surgery and will guide you through whatever treatment plan is appropriate. Good luck to you! Dawn1982, congrats on surgery. Glad you're getting a little less sore every day. Be careful taking Tylenol with narcotics, as Tylenol contains acetaminophen, which is one of the ingredients of Percocet/Oxycodone. Everyone is different on the drains. Are you drinking 8 oz every 2 hours when you're awake? That's what I was told to drink after surgery. If so, then I wouldn't worry about it. If not, then try drinking more.   ",

Chemo is certainly no fun, but my 19-week regimen was far more tolerable than I anticipated, thanks to great anti-nausea drugs and steroids. Try to meet it with gratitude and the mindset that these drugs are decimating those dastardly cancer cells. I think that you'll find a lot of great support in the March 2018 Chemo thread.

I think that if you're really organized and prepare ahead of time, you'll be fine on your own by Monday or Tuesday. This means moving essential things (plates, cups, medicines, etc) down to a reachable level and also buying groceries and making meals in advance. Also, make sure that you have plenty of pillows and/or a recliner so that you can sleep. I'm still fairly uncomfortable sleeping because I still have discomfort when I put too much pressure on my chest. I'm finding that recovery is slower than I expected (I'm still sore a month out), but nothing overwhelmed me. You might also invest in one of those grabbers, although I still use kitchen tongs to grab things up high. Of course, if you have friends who live close by, it'd be nice if they could come by every now and then to assist with groceries and laundry, etc. ",

I had an MRI and UltraSound done a few weeks ago and they were not able to detect my tumor at all, so it's responded very well to chemo. I was 51 when diagnosed. I'd do NAC again. I'd also quit browsing the internet! Remember, breast cancer is not lethal if all cancer cells remain in the breast. It's only when the cancer cells escape the breast that it can become lethal. So, in order to give us the best chance of survival, if you have a Grade 3 tumor of any type, or if there is evidence that the cancer has already escaped the breast (e.g positive lymph nodes), then they are often opting to give chemo first. That way, they can hopefully kill any cells that have escaped the breast before they become problematic, at the same time that they are shrinking (and neutralizing) the primary tumor(s). One benefit of NAC is the ability to get a lumpectomy vs mastectomy if the tumor shrinks sufficiently to warrant it, but that is certainly not the primary reason to do NAC. ",

It's freezing cold here in Ohio and I'd LOVE to get my hair back for the insulation, if not for aesthetic reasons.",

This morning, however, my husband informed me out of the blue that there is hair coming in the back of my head, right where rdeesides' hair is coming in. I've been feeling it, of course, but didn't realize it was new. See, I was the one who shaved most of my scalp and I used a 1/4\" blade. And I never lost all of my hair through A/C -- about 10% of my original hair still held on, so my scalp was never shiny and smooth. My husband, however, shaved the back of my head, since I couldn't see it, and he apparently shaved it all the way to the scalp. I guess he should know cause he's been looking at it the last 2 1/2 months! And he's saying that new black hairs are growing in. So Woot on that! P.S. I have to admit that my head looks quite ridiculous now, because what remained has kept growing. They stick out like porcupine quills through my chemo caps. I should shave them all off, but to be honest, I've grown emotionally attached to those hairs. They stuck with me through thick and thin, after all the other hair on my body jumped ship, and I don't want to betray them by shaving them off. I call them my little survivors. I'm so weird. ",

There is one circular area in the front that still doesn't have the new growth, but it seems to be filling in from the back to the front. I cannot wait to get enough back to ditch the chemo caps! A few more eyebrows fell out today, and I'm nearly eyebrowless. Thank God for Wunderbrow! I haven't lost all of my eyelashes yet, and the ones that I lost are coming back in again, slowly but surely. I still have 3 more rounds of Taxol, so hope that the baby ones don't fall out again.",
