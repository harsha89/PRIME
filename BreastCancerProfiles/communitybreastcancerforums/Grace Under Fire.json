I'm 52, mother had breast cancer in 1989 and had a full mastectomy, chemo, and radiation. She is still here today!! I started seeing a new gyno at the beginning of the year due to my horrid perimenopausal symptoms. Decided it was safe to me to start HRT with estrogen patch and progesterone, however, Dr. wanted me to have a mammogram, and then breast MRI 6 months following for screening purposes. Normal mammogram in Feb or March of this year, had the MRI last week, and I got a call from the imaging place that I needed a followup Ultrasound due to an abnormal result. Said I had a \"nodule\" at around 9:00 on my left breast. I had a radiologist today perform the US. He said before we ever started that I would need a biopsy. Of course, I asked, \"well then why aren't we doing that now?\". He said he didn't know if he would be able to see anything on the US, but expected to need the biopsy due to the MRI results. I have not read any of the results, however, the radiologist showed me the mammogram, (where nothing could be seen), the MRI, where it was very obvious an area was lit up. Not a perfectly shaped nodule, but more like an area. He said the area of concern was about 4 inches long and almost as wide and it was deep. (I don't mean it is a 4 inch tumor, this is the area that had the blue areas on the MRI). Nothing can be felt by me or him. It could be seen on the US as well. He would not tell me if it was cancer or not, but said it may be lobular, and is suspicious. I felt he was preparing me without telling me. I have a biopsy scheduled for Monday. Will be US directed. The tissue goes to a local hospital pathologist and they said I would have the results withing 24-48 hours. I have not seen the gyno since this started last week. So, besides not getting too worried, I wanted to ask the readers here what to expect and any advice you have me regarding finding the information I may need, Log in to post a reply",
