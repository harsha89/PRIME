My CT Scan report showed up the pneumonitis. So at least I know what I am dealing with. This is the second time of rads to the area which obviously put me at greater risk. I hope things will still improve for you. Thanks so much for sharing with me. Barbra",

I had radiation in Oct/Nov and started hormonal treatment. Good news is that I am NED now in Jan 08. Bad news is that I have never felt worse. I am short of breath, dry cough, tired all the time and have a fever. CT scan showed not tumors but inflammation where the radiation was done and they call it Radiation pneumonitis. I am trying to manage it with panadol for fever and Ibuprofen for inflammation. The antibiotics did nothing for me! Can anyone help?
