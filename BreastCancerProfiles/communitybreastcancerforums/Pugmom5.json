I'm amazed at how many issues I share with the rest of you. I've had shortness of breath and a high pulse off and on since #3 last week. I had a PICC put in and it's been freaking me out a bit so I thought it was that, but my husband said it could be caused by my anemia. I'm also more wiped out from this one than the other two and kind of dreading #4 in two weeks even though its my last one. This really is a hard and lonely road. I have three teenage daughters who are great girls but show no emotion to me at all. They never ask how I'm feeling or doing and it's really starting to get to me. The cancer center that I go to offers counseling with a social worker and I'm going to call tomorrow. Jen, I hope you and your son are doing okay. What an absolutely horrible experience you've both had. Thanks for letting me ramble ladies!",

It made me realize that they have been doing more to help me, it's just the never asking me how I'm doing. I know they're scared and under normal circumstances not the most emotive or affectionate bunch, but I hindsight they've been stepping up. I like the idea of sitting them down and telling them exactly what I need from them and I also still plan on calling the social worker. BeHereNow - I'm so glad you brought up the subject of intimacy. I feel really bad about it even though my husband has been understanding and wonderful. I also haven't talked to anyone about it as I don't talk about my sex life under normal circumstances so I was so grateful to see it talked about here. I had tram flap reconstruction after a bilateral mastectomy so the area from my breasts to my hips looks like a war zone and is numb! Between that and my bald head, I'm just not feeling sexy or in the mood at all. Heather214 - thank you for a much needed and always appreciated laugh!",

It totally sucks that we have to go through this but I feel like at least I'm in great company with all of you. I was going to ask if anyone had watery and twitchy eyes and saw a bunch of posts about it. My eyes have been terrible for the past two days. I'm thinking of trying allergy medicine even though I never have allergies. My husband thought it might be a sign of my eyelashes falling out - has anyone noticed this happening before losing eyelashes? I agree with all that #3 has totally sucked. I'm two weeks past and I'm still wiped out. #4 and last TC is next Tuesday - it can't get here soon enough.",

Time has gone so slowly since my diagnosis in January. After #3, I really had a hard time thinking about going through this again, but now that it's here, I'm so ready! In answer to how to thank everyone, I've done a few things. I'm a knitter and its one of the things that has gotten me through surgery recovery and chemo. I knit scarves and am currently knitting a shawl for some friends and the home visit nurse I had post surgery. I bought a blessings bracelet for my neighbor who flushed my PICC line for a week when my husband was away. Today I'm bringing brownies to the nurses to celebrate the final chemo. The guidance counselor at the school where I work is also going through breast cancer treatment and next week are are bringing muffins and fruit to thank everyone there. At the end if the summer we're going to have a \"thank you\" party in our backyard to thank all of our friends who have been so wonderful to us. And finally we're planning a family trip to celebrate all of us getting through this! One of the positives of this journey is finding out how truly amazing people can be, including all of you warriors!",

      "Content": "May 19, 2013 07:40PM Pugmom5 wrote: Hi everyone. I started my chemo on April 2 so I'm a little late to this group, but as my mom used to say, \"better late than never\". I was diagnosed with stage 2 lobular invasive breast cancer in January after removal of what was thought to be a benign sebaceous cyst from my right breast. I had a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap reconstruction on February 14. The surgical decision was an easy one for me because my mammogram in November and ultrasound in December showed nothing and I was taking no chances. It turned out to be the right decision because there spots in my left side as well (that also didn't show up on MRIs or CAT scans). My nodes were clear and my oncotype was 18 so the chemo decision wasn't as easy. After many opinions, research and thought, I decided to go for chemo and make sure this cancer is really gone. I've had three treatments of taxotere/cytoxin and the fourth and last one will be June 4. So after my long introduction, the reason I've decided to get on this site now is because I'm having a hard time getting through these last few weeks. I has a PICC put in the last time because I had a bad reaction to the IV site after treatment #2. I know I'm almost there but I'm so sick of feeling crappy, cotton mouth, my bald head (and other bald parts), and people telling me how fast it's going. I just needed a place to vent and this seemed to be a safe place to do it. Thank you!",
