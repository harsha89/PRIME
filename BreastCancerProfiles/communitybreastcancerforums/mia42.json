I had needle localization and clip insertion during my biopsy but my surgery was not too bad--went in at 9am and was home by 5pm. The next step is where I am stuck and running out of time, I feel, to make a decision. My heart goes out to all of us dealing with this and I know that we can beat it!",

My Oncotype score was 9, but because of the micromets, I am now waiting for Mammoprint results (hopefully, by the end of next week)! Luckily my insurance covered the Mammoprint since I did not qualify for the research study because of my low Oncotype score. I am hoping for a low mammoprint score to help me decide my treatment. To chemo or not to chemo? BTW...I am totally jealous of all of you with negative nodes....still getting over that little piece of info #pityparty!",

Results are given as a recurrence score between zero and 100, which are translated as low risk (a score of 18 or lower), medium risk (19 to 30), or high risk (31 or above). The MammaPrint microarray assay measures expression of 70 genes in fresh tissue; it categorizes patients as either high risk, with a so-called poor signature, or low risk (a so-called good signature) for recurrence. There is no intermediate category. Mammostrat is an immunohistochemistry test measuring five markers: p53, HTF9C, CEACAM5, NDRG1, and SLC7A5. The results are combined into a quantitative risk index: low, moderate, and high. For now, only MammaPrint has FDA clearance.\" This came fro an article on the College of American Pathologists website.http://www.cap.org/apps/cap.portaL?_nfpb=true&cntvwrPtlt_actionOverride=%2Fportlets%2FcontentViewer%2Fshow&_windowLabel=cntvwrPtlt&cntvwrPtlt%7BactionForm.contentReference%7D=cap_today%2F0611%2F0611a_testing_recurrence.html&_state=maximized&_pageLabel=cntvwr msmaples516--good luck with radiation! Let me know how it goes because it is in my immediate or possibly post-chemo future! You would not have qualified for the mammaprint study because you had a low Oncotype score and are node negative so that probably why you hadn't heard about it.",

After my mammogram, biopsy, and MRI, my BS and radiation onco were telling me I would not need chemo, but my MO has said chemo from day one. I wanted the lumpectomy because I knew it could be scheduled quickly, I knew from the MRI that I only had one lesion (breast feed two kids so no dense breast tissue here:), and I wanted this crap out of me. Walking around knowing it was there felt like I was in the alien movies with a malicious monster in me LOL! Initially after surgery, I thought I did not have any positive nodes but one node was positive for micromets less than .6mm of unorganized cells! It was like a gut punch! So again my MO is saying chemo until my Oncotype score came back as 9 i.e. low risk of reoccurence. I am now waiting on the results of my Mammoprint study which will score my tumor as low or high risk. I think that radiation will take care of the micromets but I still have a nagging feeling that I don't want to regret not having chemo if I should have a reoccurrence somewhere down the road. Trying to make this decision based on fact and not on fear or MO pressure. Has anyone else had the Oncotype testing? As a nurse, I do not believe in assembly line healthcare and agree with the posts that stress the importance of considering each person's case individually as it is unique. Sending out prayers for healing and positive energy to you all!",
