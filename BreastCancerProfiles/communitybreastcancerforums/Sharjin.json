I went back to starting of this thread and started reading everyone's fighting stories and got attached with everyone. And by the time I come to the end, I see you wonderful people remembering me and asking about my mom's health. I could not be any more grateful. Thank you so much for remembering me Hartrish, Kaayborg, kay, Minxie , Riley and everybody. I have come from canada in Singapore to be with my mother for a month as she is taking treatment in here. Every night I sleep right beside her and realize how hard it can be to fill up your lungs with some oxygen in this world full of air. My mother had very bad chest congestion in the starting of this month and her pleural effusion was not going away. She was admitted in the hospital and 2drains from both of the lungs were there to drain the water. She was in unbearable pain and all her electrolytes went down. She was in no condition to start chemotherapy. Then the doctors made her stable with infusions, antibiotics and removed the water completely and the they took out the drain from both sides. Now she will start chemotherapy from 4th. It took us a bit long to start the treatment as I really wanted her to get into a clinical trial with immunotherapy called 'impassion132' with standard chemo Carbo and Gemzer. Her oncologist really wants her to be in the trial but it's an UK based study and we still don't know if she will get the immunotherapy or not as it has only 50percent chance. We waited for extra 10days to start Treatment so that she can get the immunotherapy and the wait time is so depressing. If she doesn't end up getting the drug but only placebo, it will break my heart again and the wait time was for nothing. But it's ok. As long as we get to start the treatment, I can hope for her to respond fully to the treatment. Worst part, after draining, my mother felt really good for the first few days and then she has this unbearable chest pain, tightness, cough and congestion but there is no more water left. The tumour in the lungs probably are creating the mishaps. She is continuously on morphine, 5mg/ml 4 times a day. It does help with the pain sometimes and knocks her off, making her sleep almost all the day. I am just praying day and night for her to work this Carbo gemzer combo to make everything better. Good part is, she did a pet scan last month, February and did brain, bone, chest, pelvis, neck can separately this month 21st. Her tumours and nodules haven't changed much in size from that time and the cancer is not spread to any other organs other than lungs. Her oncologist was surprised for such an aggressive cancer not to spread or increase in size much in one and a half month. That's why we could held the patience to wait for extra 10days. I wish I could take some of her pain, at least for a night. Sometimes I feel so bad to live my life seeing everyone is fighting so hard. I never will take life for granted. I know the Almighty is there and everywhere and watching over everyone silently and there will always be good in exchange of pain. Sorry for such a long post. May be I am extra emotional This pregnancy days. But I really love my mom to a point where I see darkness without her and I know it's for everyone. Sorry for whining for so long but I feel kind of relaxed to share my feeling with everyone.",

My mom is not doing so well. To get into the trial took so long for her, she did not have started a single treatment yet after 2months of finding out this metastatic pleural effusion. We are so frustrated with everything. Yesterday was her long awaited chemo schedule and by the time she got to hospital, she had slight fever with severe breathing shortness. They canceled chemo, got her admitted in the hospital to observe her and check her for infection and did lots of blood test. I will get to know today if she is able to get chemo today. If they tell one more time study wants her to be stable first, I am straight coming out of this and starting chemotherapy without trial. With MPE, prognosis looks so grim.

Minxie and Hartrish: Good luck for your upcoming scans. Looking forward to hear good news next week. My mom is doing better, still doing the Carbo/Gemzer. Her last scan after getting 2cycles showed improvements. But these chemos are getting hard on her blood count. She already had blood transfusion after 3rd cycle for low Hb and got Neulasta shot too. And she is so tired all the time, has lost her appetite, feeling nauseated, forcing herself to eat. She is complaining about pain right below her rib cages, but she just did the scan of the whole thorax and abdomen 3weeks back, every other organ came normal and no other Mets other than pleura. I don't know what's causing that. May be normal acidity pain but hearing anything about pain has kept me on my toes.",

Few days back she was always on 3litres oxygen but today I see her without oxygen for the whole day. Her chest congestion and breathing is better than before. She still is weak, goes breathless if she walks or doesn\u2019t take rest because there is still fluid left in her lung But a lot better than before. It\u2019s a relief to see her improving. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the chemo or the steroids to make her feel better and improve her appetite and dyspnea as steroids also improve the condition in patients with lymphangitis carcinomatosis. Everything I read on internet about it looks so awful. She will have her scans after 2rounds of chemo, on 15th of May. Praying to the Almighty with my heart and soul for the chemo to work.

Truth is so harsh and reality is so spontaneous, they always leave us to admit the most difficult things in easiest way, No matter how hard we try to avoid it. My mother has passed away on last 17th of September at evening. Everyone in the family is devastated with her untimely demise. We are trying to find peace thinking that all of her sufferings came to an end and she is in a better place now. She was brave and fought valiantly for last 2years.
