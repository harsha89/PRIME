Thank you, everyone, for sharing your fears and victories. I'm here just raising my hand to say, \"yeah -- me, too.\" I'm through surgery and chemo and am in the middle of radiation, and I'm already fretting over persistent aches. My oncologist told me he expects me to see cancer again because of my many cancerous axillary nodes. Fortunately, I got a second opinion that was much more positive. At this point, I wish I had a switch I could toggle -- knowing/not knowing -- so I could be better at spending time undistracted with my folks, etc. Thank you all for reporting in that this can get better with time. For those like me and still in their first couple years, (fist bump) I'm with ya'. Old-timers and newbies, let's all hang in there. :)",

If it helps, a friend's wife was diagnosed years ago as a 3C with a huge tumor and a few nodes, and she is still NED and lives joyfully. She's a hoot and an inspiration.",

      "Content": "Apr 29, 2019 01:33PM - edited Apr 29, 2019 02:13PM by JMouse Hi, orlando74, it's very nice to meet you, too! I'm so sorry you are going through this as well. Sorry, I'd messed with my Settings. I think I've got my details appearing now. In case they don't ... I'm about 10 years older than you, also with no family history of breast cancer, and diagnosed last autumn with two ER/PR+ HER- tumors and 16 of 18 underarm nodes positive. (No other nodes were biopsied.) We're all hoping I don't recur, but my oncologist thinks I'm likely to metastasize someday. Fortunately the other oncologist spoke about my odds way more positively. ðŸŒˆ So if you see any similarities, don't despair! ðŸŒˆ (I really don't want to bring anyone here down. I like my primary MO for many reasons, but his kindly-voiced doom and gloom is not one of them.) Yes, holy crap, I know. Surprisingly, I made it half-way through chemo before I *really* lost it. The cancer in my mind is so much worse than the cancer in my body, it seems at times. I totally understand the obsessing. I'm still hanging in there. Hope you are, too. I don't have tips to share yet, but I will when I have 'em. :) Best wishes to you, too. Hope to see you around here. :)",

(The Momchichi ad jingle is playing in my head now. :D ) Your first MO told you that in your first appointment?! I'm so glad you spoke to other oncologists! Yes, I like Lexica's plan: let's all skew statistics out of spite if nothing else! :) Meow13, thank you for your story of your friend Minh. Lexica is right: it's stories like hers and lkc's and YATCOMW's that inspire... and fire my spite. ;P KK2018, you are about a month ahead of me in fairly similar treatment, and I agree on the compartmentalizing cancer thing. I look forward to that future day, too. :) LaughingGull, I agree, being in treatment helped. (I'm Team Lymphovascular invasion, too, by the way. Woo, go team.) mpv459, I cried a great deal in the second half of chemo. It's just where I cracked. Have you found anything that has helped you? I joined an in-person BC group (through the medical center) and even called a BC counseling hotline -- SHARE -- and spoke with a lovely women who was battling BC, too. And of course, I stumbled upon this forum. :) Thanks everyone for writing. Nice to meet you all.",

Yes, fibroadenomas can grow, but they also can stay the same or shrink. I've had a few removed surgically. Each was done in a surgical theater, but I was still sent home the same day. Tracking growth with ultrasounds is pretty standard. My fibroadenomas never appeared on mammograms, due mostly to my dense breast tissue, I think. Not to scare you, but still get regularly screened for breast cancer. I've had doctors assure me I was low risk for BC because of my cyst and fibro- history. Woo, were they wrong.",
