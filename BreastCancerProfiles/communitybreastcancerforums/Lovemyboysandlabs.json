I asked her how sure she was and she replied, \"I would be very surprised if this is cancer\". She sent me for the mammogram and ultrasound just as a precaution. I was relieved. Fast forward after multiple pictures and retakes to me sitting with the radiologist hearing her say \"this is likely cancer and I know that's not what you wanted to hear.\"  I had my biopsy today, that doctor barely said a word when doing the test. I am sure what my test result will be on Tuesday I just pray I caught it early enough (clear mammogram 7 months ago). I just need someone to talk to right now. My emotions go from sobbing uncontrollably to feeling pissed and ready to fight it to a strange sense of calm. I have 2 young boys and all I can think about is what this will do to them.  The waiting is horrible.

      "Content": "Lovemyboysandlabs wrote: Well I had my biopsy on Thursday. They said I would definitely get the results today. Still nothing, doc says that they will follow up. So I wait even longer. i took today off because I thought it would be the day I got official word. I had lunch with my kids at school which helped a lot-- seeing so many happy kids without a care in the world.  I've been crying, depressed, angry since I got news Wednesday that it is probably cancer. Today is the first day since then I've felt at peace and a bit normal. I am no longer thinking so much about dying, which in itself is a major milestone. It is still there a bit and I know it will be something that lingers, but it isn't all I think about. I think what's helped me get to this place is this community. Reading about so many others that are going through the same thing and are making it has brought me light in a grey world. Someone wrote on one of the boards that cancer is a common illness that so many people will battle in their lifetime. I thought about that for a moment. I know    So many people that either know someone or have it themselves. It really opened my eyes. Shirley temple died at age 85, she had breast cancer in the 70s. Wow. I am not going to have visions of dying, I refuse. I am ready to fight. I will probably get the call tomorrow and am ready. I know this will be a long road but I know I have this place to come to when I need it. Thank you.
