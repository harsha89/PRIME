Anyone else feeling down since starting the rads? I have been very upbeat about this whole mess it is just this I feel like I am on a slippery slide down. I know I am tired of HOT FLASHES!!!",

I will have a 4 day weekend and I don't know if that is usual or not but I guess it is ok to miss 4 days in a row. I have sharpie marks all over me and tabs too. Plus they tried a new ink but it just keeps rubbing off on everything.  Stragtic looking its not.",

I am in Texas and I get so hot from the energy surges, then I feel the cold so much more after the hot flash finishes.  I am suppose to start femara but I am having second thoughts on it if one of the se is more hot flashes.  I don't think I will be able to bare it when summer gets here.  I can't afford to keep my house at 70 deg. that would for sure put me in the poor house.  Does anyone know what the percentage is when taking medicine after rads.  Does it really help that much to make a big difference?  I am suppose to start in January, Has anyone decided not to take medicine?",

My ribs didn't bother either, we are all so different yet alike.  My husband has never been one for little gifts, but he helps clean the house, takes my car in when work is needed and so many other things that make life nicer for me.  Would l like a special little gift once and a while, sure, but it is not going to happen as Mimi said, at this late stage.  I have been married 40 years this January, You keep hoping, but live with reality of the way things are.  Jules,  I see that you have a kindle, I go one last year for Christmas and I just love it. I have over 100 books on it now and 95 % were free.  Let me know what youo think of it.",

My Dr told me I would get 28 plus the 5 boosts, which are really nothing at all.  I was hoping that she might have cut back on mine at the end like a friend of mine, but no dice I had to go the full 33 treatments.  I too would have been so mad if I had found out that they added more on at the end than what I thought would happen. I do feel for you that is a real bummer! SoManyWomen, I hope you plan on something special for your anniversary.  When we are going through this stuff we all need something special to look forward to.  I have no plans to leave the thread becuase like you said we can talk medicine here even w/i going to the Femara thread.We can find out what SE we each have. ",
