I had exactly same type of cancer as you; had a mastectomy last month, and because a mammoprint test came back as high risk, I start 4 rounds of chemo next week. The hardest part for me was seeing those around me suffer, but take my advice, this is all about you and you need to be selfish to make sure you get better and have all the support you need.",

I had a mastectomy a month ago and it looked as though my treatment plan was going to be taking oestrogen blockers for 5 years but the result of the mammoprint came back on friday last week as High Risk. Everything else is negative; lymph nodes unaffected and the only reason that they did the mammoprint was because it was a grade 2 cancer. When the doctor told me that 4 sessions of chemo would be a good option, and she saw that I was visibly upset, she said that the other option was to just have the tablets but that the chemo would increase the probability of the cancer not coming back in 5 years from 80 to 90%. I am really concerned about the side effects of chemo and the effect it will have on me and my 2 kids (I am a single m mum of 2). If the cancer was not in the lymph nodes, and it is 80% Oestrogen receptive, then surely with oestrogen blockers, it will be enough to stop it? Anybody had a similar experience? I should probably do chemo but i am concerned about pumping loads of chemicals into my body for 3 months.     Dx 3/11/2016, IDC, Left, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 2, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
