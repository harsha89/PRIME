    "Content": "Jan 25, 2015 04:54PM - edited Jan 25, 2015 04:59PM by lilmouse I just finished radiation treatment for cancer on the left side about 6 weeks ago and did DIBH. Before starting treatment I agreed participate in a study of DIBH, and as part of that I had a heart scan before starting treatment. I'll have one more sometime this summer, so I guess I'll get some objective evidence as to whether or not there has been any change in my heart function. Obviously it hasn't been long, but so far I'm feeling pretty good. For the actual treatment, they had me lie on my back with my arms behind my head. I didn't have any trouble with the breath hold. Sometimes they had me hold it for a short time and sometimes longer, but I never figured out a pattern. I was told that the machine would cut off the beam if I moved too far out of position, but I don't know if all treatment machines do this. ",
