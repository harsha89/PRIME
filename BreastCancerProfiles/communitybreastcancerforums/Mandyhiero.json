To make a long story short, I'm 34 years old and I found an indentation in my right breast and went for ultrasound and mammogram ordered by my gynecologist, and both were negative. I then went to a new Primary Care Physician for a lump I found under my arm, and a burning pain on the top of my breast. She did a thorough breast exam and told me everything seemed fine, that the lump was an \"ingrown hair\" and was sent for an ultrasound of the axilla and it was diagnosed as an abcess and I was put on antibiotics. Th abcess has gone down now to where I can barely even feel it Fast forward to now, three weeks later, and I still have the burning feeling on and off all day. It's where my cleavage starts and goes to where my breast meets my arm pit. Kind of in a line, if that makes sense. It itches occasionally, I've noticed my skin looks a little more blotchy on that side but it's not enough that my mom even noticed when I showed her.I don't have any warmth, redness, or size difference from the other side. My neck also hurts on that side from time to time. I'm trying not to freak out, but several things I've read from people who have had IBC says inflammatory breast cancer doesn't always have the classic symptoms. Some people just experienced pain and slight change in the breast. I know IBC is rare, but I still can't shake the feeling that I have it! Log in to post a reply",

I actually called my primary care dr this morning and told her that I'm having he burning pain and she said I had mentioned that to her at my last visit and she had hoped it would have cleared up with the antibiotics she gave me for the abcess undermy arm. She said since they have ruled out breast problems with the mammogram and ultrasound, that as perturbing as this is, it's more of a watch and wait situation. I mentioned shingles and how if it had been shingles that surely a rash would have already developed if it's been three weeks and she said to watch for a rash and call if there's any change. I thought I would give it until after thanksgiving and if it's still painful, I'm calling her and asking to be seen. Going crazy with worry but I'll be busy enough for the next few days that hopefully I won't have too much time to think about it.",

You would also have some sort of swelling, orange peel skin, swollen lymph nodes under your arm or above the collar bone, and pain. I think given the fact that yours comes and goes is a good indication that it\u2019s nothing to do with IBC. I would go to your primary care doctor and let them take a look and see where you need to go from there. Trust me, I\u2019m not making light of what you\u2019re feeling. I\u2019ve just been where you are as far as where your anxiety has you going and it\u2019s not pleasant. Maybe talk to your doctor about being put on something to help with your anxiety?

All of my problems started back in November of 2017. I had found a dimple in my right breast that after mammogram and ultrasound turned out to be lazy ligaments. Fast forward to earlier this year and I had what the breast surgeon thought to be an enlarged lymph node where my breast meets my arm (if that makes sense) but nothing to worry about. I had put it all in the back of my mind until a couple of weeks ago when I started getting some weird pains on the inner lower part of my breast. I just put that off to being hormonal and tried not to worry about it. Last week we went on vacation to Florida and I swam a lot in the ocean and played with my kids and nieces and nephews. So when the pains didn\u2019t go away and it hurt into my neck and my arm, I thought, I\u2019ve just played a little too hard, took some Tylenol and tried to forget about it. Through the week I had some itchiness and pain and once again, thought it had to be that I was on my period and the itchiness was from being in a wet bathing suit at the beach. I should mention it also hurts to press on the area. Almost like a bruise feels when you press on it. I don\u2019t really feel anything different from the left breast. I think I will call the doctor first thing Monday morning or at least go see the breast navigator at the building that I work in, but I want to know if maybe I\u2019m just jumping the gun and letting my anxiety get the best of me, or if it really is a legitimate concern to have, that maybe the ultrasound and mammogram may have missed something. Should I push for more tests, or just let it go? Log in to post a reply",

I thought IBC for the longest time, because isn\u2019t that everyone\u2019s worst fear when you think about breast cancer? I have itching most every day, but not always the same spot, and no other classic signs of IBC so that calmed me some about that. But, I\u2019ve read that some women have had itching with other types of breast cancers. I\u2019m 35 with two girls, 4 and almost 2 and I want to be here for them but all I can think is the longer I get put off by doctors, the more it could be growing. I know, I\u2019ve got the cart before the horse. But I\u2019m honestly terrified that that\u2019s what is happening.

I realized I posted on the wrong post so I thought in case you all didn\u2019t read it, I would post it here so you might see it.She did a breast exam, (probably the 6th one I've had in a year), looked at my mammogram from last November, and told me the rib pain and breast pain I'm experiencing is normal and she's not concerned at all about it. She told me to take evening primrose oil for the pain. I told her that I was concerned that sometimes cancer doesn't show up on mammograms and ultrasounds and that people have MRI's that often detect their breast cancer and she said that they must have had a palpable lump because that's the only reason they do MRI's for breast imaging. She said that if she really thought there was a chance of breast cancer that she would tell me but otherwise I would have to pay out of pocket for an MRI because insurance wouldn't pay for it. I'm still having pain, some itchiness, and I feel like my right breast looks like it's shrunk a little, but I guess that could be all in my head. The indentation is still there too. So, I'm back to square one and still a little worried. I guess I'll just keep an eye on it and try to put it to the back of my mind. At this point I don't think there's anything else I can do.",

Not sure if you're familiar with what that is but it's an inflammation of the cartilage that connects the ribs to the breastbone. I'm not buying it, but what else can I do?! I also had an area like the one you have on the upper outer quadrant of my breast that the breast surgeon was even concerned about but the ultrasound showed nothing I hope you get some answers soon!

I immediately called my mom and had her come and see what she thought. She thought it was strange but told me to give it until the morning and if it didn't look better to call my midwife. Well, I panicked and texted my midwife who is a friend and she told me to come in the next morning and be seen. She saw the indention, felt around and didn't feel any lumps, but sent me for an ultrasound. I had the ultrasound yesterday, which the technichian only went around my areola and nipple, and nowhere else, and told me the radiologist didn't see anything but wanted to do bilateral mammograms. I went right after the ultrasound to the mammograms and they were also clear and no signs of a mass that would cause the indentation. I know I should be happy about the results but I'm still scared! What is causing the indentation and why is no one concerned about it? I do have burning pain in my breast and aching from myarmpit to elbow at times and am not sure if that has something to do with it or not. Should I go Monday to see someone else or am I being paranoid? Also, would inflammatory breast cancer present as an indentation first? I don't have a rash or redness. I also might add that my mammogram said scattered fibroglandular densities. Which I'm guessing is the density of my breast tissue. Anyone know what that means? Log in to post a reply",

My backstory is that I have an indentation on my areola under my nipple. About the size of a 50 cent piece. Both 3D diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were both clear and I don\u2019t have dense breast tissue despite the fact that I\u2019m only 35. I was told I had a mix of fat and fibrous tissue. I asked my breast doctor for an MRI but she refused saying insurance wouldn\u2019t pay for it. I\u2019ve been to a breast surgeon twice and she has assured me that everything is fine and normal with my breasts but my gut is telling me that there\u2019s something wrong. I feel stupid because that should be enough to alleviate anyone\u2019s fears but I keep getting new symptoms that leave me questioning things. Two weeks ago I started getting tingling in my lower lip and chin that comes and goes. I\u2019ve also had it in other parts of my face but not as much. When I looked it up (I know, terrible idea!) it terrified me. One of the main causes is a breast cancer that metastasized to a nerve and has a very grim prognosis. As in months. Needless to say, I\u2019m so scared now. After being examined and everything, is that really a possibility? That I would have a cancer that didn\u2019t show up on ultrasound and mammogram but has spread to my organs? I plan on calling my doctor first thing Monday morning but I need someone to talk me down from the ledge right now! Log in to post a reply",

I wanted to comment because I've had the cancer scare (still do from time to time) and also had sternum pain and pain into the same shoulder. I went to my rheumatologist and he diagnosed me with something called costochondritis which is an inflammation of the cartilage around the sternum. Look it up and see if it sounds like what you're experiencing. Regardless you should go see a doctor to rule out anything serious, but I just wanted to calm your fears a little. I don't think if it is cancer that it would spread in a matter of days. Good luck and let us know how things go. I'll be praying for you.",

I just got back from seeing a new primary care doctor and she did a very thorough breast exam of both breasts and said everything felt very normal. She also examined the area where I have the indentation and said where I have larger breasts that ligaments are to blame. She said she's seen dimpling and what she saw doesn't look concerning. She looked up the results of the mammogram and said it was a diagnostic mammogram and was happy with that but said if I felt that it needed to be looked into further to never be afraid to come back in and she would order more imaging. I go back in 6 weeks to follow up. Thank guy all for your advice. I appreciate you!",

Every time I went back for reassurance that the dent was nothing, I felt the same way. I don\u2019t think that was the doctor\u2019s intentions.
