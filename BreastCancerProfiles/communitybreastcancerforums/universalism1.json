    "Content": "universalism1 wrote: I do not really know where to start, so I'll start with December 2013.... To we week before Christmas I had a mastopexy with implants. It was purely cosmetic, I had never had a problem with my breast in any medical way. After have had 3 full terms pregnancies and the years gone by, gravity took its toll and I wanted to fix my tata's to help my self esteem.   The surgery went well. I was in a same day services hospital and I did well in recovery so I was able to go home. I did everything by the book and everything went well. Now flash forward to  June of 2013. I took a fall and my doctor did x-rays to make sure I did not do any harm. The results showed I have degenerative disk disease that is way more advanced than it should be for my age. I had been hurting some and had headaches for years but never attributed it to anything other than stress and long hours. I have not worked since then. I am in a battle about getting some things taken care of for that situation, and in the meantime I am pretty much in constant pain and most days I am bed ridden. I do force myself to get up and exercise even when I do not feel like it because I do not want to waste away, I'm too young for that.  In the start of March I noticed that my back was hurting more in he the center than it had in the past, until then it was in my cervical and lumbar regions. Just what I needed, another spot to hurt on my body! It hurt so bad I had problems wearing a bra some days.  Then this week I noticed that my right breast was leaking blood inside my bra, or on he tag days I was not wearing a bra it was in my top. This prompted me to do an exam of my breast and the right breast was nothing like it was the month before when I did my monthly self exam. My right breast droops lower than my left, it is fuller on the bottom and outside.  I feel pressure in my chest, making breathing a little hard. And I have noticed my right breast is really soft on top, nothing at all like my left breast. The only way I can explain this is its like a muscle that turned to flab. My implants are under the muscle and both are right where they have always been since my mastopexy and lift. They have not moved so I know I have not bottomed out with an implant, and I have not deflated so I do not think my implant is messed up. I also have weakness and pain in my right arm.  I sent my truck to the shop and left myself without a ride because I did not figure I would need it for a few days until it was fixed, so I am stuck at home alone. I plan to make an appointment in the morning with my GYN, its time for my yearly anyway, so I may as well see him, get my yearly and explain these problems to him. Wold that be the correct thing to do? Or should I make an appointment with my plastic surgeon?  I'm so confused and mad at myself for even googling this breast issue now because now I am scared! And I really do not need another illness to plague me, I have enough things going on with me already. I am 37 feeling like I am 70.  Log in to post a reply",
