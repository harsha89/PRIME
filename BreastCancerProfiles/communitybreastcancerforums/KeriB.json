I did have black spots on my two big toe nails. On seems to be fine the other side just came off 2 weeks ago. I could not believe that 6 months later that could happen, but it did.Forturnatly I did not lose the whole nail and they were able to put a tip on the toe. It looks great, no one would ever know that it is a fake nail. Good luck.",
