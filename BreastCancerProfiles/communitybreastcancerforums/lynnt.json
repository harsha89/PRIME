    "Content": "lynnt wrote: Hi, I have developed what my oncologist is calling a fat necrosis on my reconstructed breast. The area was painful off and on. When I felt my breast at the pain's source last week, I felt a dreaded lump. Freaked out, of course. Saw my doctor today and she is saying that it is most likely a fat necrosis. I will be having an ultrasound done soon. Have any of you had this problem? If so, has the necrosis eventually dissipated or does it just stay there? Thanks!
