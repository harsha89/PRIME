    "Content": "Katiebug13 wrote: I would appreciate some insight. I'm 31 and nursing my 4th baby, who is 10 weeks old. I've never had mastitis but have had a plugged duct with baby #3. Yesterday evening I noticed a painless red area, about quarter sized, below my areola on my right breast. I had just fed the baby, so I assumed he had his hand smushed there or something. This morning I noticed the redness had increased in area and is now tender to the touch. I have no fever, fatigue, breast lumps, etc that I have always heard accompanied mastitis. I called my OB office and they called me in Keflex for 7 days and said it was probably mastitis, but to make an appt if it doesn't improve in a week. Could this still be mastitis without fever? Or breastfeeding related, without the plugged duct feeling? My maternal grandmother had breast cancer, so there is a family history and a friend of a friend passed away last week from IBC at the age of 29, so it's fresh in my mind too.
