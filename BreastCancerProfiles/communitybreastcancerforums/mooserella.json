Cancer is an interesting ride, but I'd really kind of like to get off.  Too bad that's not an option.  We need to be here for each other because nobody else really understands what it's like unless they have gone through some form of it themselves.  Unfortunately, I have more and more company every year in my friends, family and co-workers. ",

Having already been through the gauntlet of cancer and its assault on the mind and body once before, I can safely say that this time my reaction to diagnosis was not one of shock and horror, it was more one of angry resignation.  I no longer have that \"How could this happen to me?!?!\" reaction, it is more of a \"NOT AGAIN!!\".  The fact that the body can mutiny silently and insidiously in such a manner seems to be the ultimate betrayal.  I have no notion of ever putting this behind me.  It is going to be a perpetual shadow, but one that will always whisper to me \"Live your life, enjoy your time here, because you don't know when it will be over\".  I do not want cancer to turn me into a sour old woman.  I want it to help me to be the wise, vigilant crone who has learned that life is more than just superficial enjoyment, it is for doing meaningful things to improve the lives of the ones we love. When I see the ads on TV for the Walk for the Cure, etc., it makes me feel surreal when it strikes in that I am now a part of that ever growing community of victims and survivors of the most common form of cancer in women.  It also makes me feel grateful to those who have gone before me, who have contributed to the body of research that has made my likelihood for survival and cure a possibility.  I weep for those we have lost, and I thank them with all my heart for their courage, their sacrifice and their dignity in the face of eternity.",
