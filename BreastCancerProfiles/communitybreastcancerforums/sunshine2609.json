Pathology still benign luckily. 3 days after surgery i developed a yellow bruise and bump. Called the nurse today and she said it could be a hematoma. Of course this is ok. But i also read if the hematoma dissolves it could leave scar tissue. And then i did surgery for nothing. Because the new scar tissue will feel like a lump. Which the fibrosis also felt like. Do you have any experience in developing hard scar tissue after dissolving of the hematoma? Does it occur and how does it feel? Thanks a lot!! Log in to post a reply",

The lump is really hard en becomes very tender near my period (I also have fibrocystic breasts). I talked to a surgeon and I could have the lump removed. This is done under general anesthetic. So now I am wondering. What should I do. It would be great if this thing is gone. I keep worrying about it. But I am also a hypochondriac. But the surgeon said; o no big deal, we just flip the thing out. Everyone any experience with benign lumpectomy? I am worried about internal scar tissue which also feels hard so it wouldn't solve anything eventually. Any advice is welcome :) Log in to post a reply",
