My cat started limping and it turned out he had a cyst on his leg. I agonized over this, but I had the leg amputated. The vets all said a dog or cat can do fine on three legs. I brought him home the day after the surgery and was told to keep him in a small cage for a few days. He was having none of that. I opened the door, he leaped over me and took off RUNNING down the hall. That was four years ago. Today he still jumps wherever he wants, runs, the whole thing. And he's happy. I was told by the vet med college that when the leg was removed, the cancer was removed and he needed no chemo or anything else. You might want to ask your vet about amputating the leg and if it would get it all. I can guarantee you that I was stunned to learn that cats and dogs can do just fine with three legs.",
