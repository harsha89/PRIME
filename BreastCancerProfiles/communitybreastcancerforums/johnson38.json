I found swollen supraclavicular lymph node on the right side a month ago, and have been having significant tenderness in that same side breast. There are noticeable differences like dipping or caving in and I had a breast exam after being checked for infections and metabolic panel came back clear. Going to diagnostic mammogram the day after thanksgiving and also having ultrasound on right breast. Time seems to have come to a complete stop! I go about my day but into is always right there in the back of my mind. My husband is typically very supportive but has shut down since the possibility of BC came up. I don\u2019t want to worry others until i have more answers so I was very thankful to have found this site. Just saying this little bit here makes me feel better Log in to post a reply",

The only consoling thought is that I will know that day if I need more testing as our hospital offers patients immediate results on diagnostic exams.",
