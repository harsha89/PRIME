It was left on for 6 weeks until everything healed and my scabs came off. (I did not get to shower that first 6 weeks) This time around (exchange) He took my tagaderm off at 9 days post op. I'm almost 4 weeks out and my steri strips are just starting to release on the edges. I soap them up, but they're not ready to come off. I'm okay with that as they're protecting my scars. Plus my skin tears when adhesive is pulled off. No thanks! So my question is this...did the surgeon tell you to remove the tape? If not, just leave it be.",

There's definitely some genetic factor they have yet to discover. To answer your question you really will have to consider the advantages and disadvantages. Yes, the outcomes for Lx and rads are the same for BMX. Read up about both and make a pros/cons list. (That's what I did). Will the constant screenings cause you more stress and anxiety? Or are you ok with that? Will it affect your quality of life? Are you able to take the time needed to convalesce after the BMX surgery? Do you want to deal with reconstruction? You certainly don't have to. It's by no means an easy surgery, but many of us have done it and have no regrets...even though our experiences may include difficulties and set backs. Talk to your sisters and see how they feel about their decisions. Maybe attend a local support group. I'm sure other ladies will be along shortly to share their experience and wisdom. I had a BMX because my tiny breast would have been so disfigured and rads would have made it difficult to reconstruct. I was a mess when first diagnosed and never wanted to deal with the stress of waiting and not knowing again, ever! I was only 39, have three small children and discovered that I'm pretty vain during this journey. I wanted to get something out of this mess, so bigger breasts were my prize. My husband works from home so he could be here to help me. I had family fly in and help as well as a massive network of friends to support me in the way of meals, child care, etc... It was no picnic, but they made it much easier for me. I couldn't have done it without them. I'm happy with my decision and my new foobs.",

Try to keep occupied in the meantime...clean out closets, organize stuff, anything that will keep your mind off the wait. Weekends are somewhat slow, but I'm sure someone from your area will chime in on their experiences with surgeons and oncologists. In the meantime you can use the search page. Try typing in local hospital names and seeing what threads come up. There might even be a thread for NYC as many members have started groups for their particular metropolitan area.",

Hopefully it should resolve itself by the time you fly. Check with your surgeon to see if it might pose any issues. I haven't had many problems with leg cramps on Tamoxifen (been on it just over 2 months), just when I'm working out and doing a lot of foot flexing (yoga & pilates). I take a B complex and magnesium daily to help combat the side effects and really they are minimal for me. The occasional mild foot cramp or hot flash. Nothing to write home about. One thing I want to mention to you - I was told to stop taking Tamoxifen 5 days before air travel or long car rides, because of the clotting risk. Again, this is something you'll want to discuss with you MO. I don't know if that risk is the same on an AI. I hope your seroma goes away soon.",
