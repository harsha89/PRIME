Itchy nipple for 4 months. 2 months ago found lump, waited till after period. 2 weeks later found another lump. Right now past next period, both lumps there. 1st lump feels like a green bean with a bump at the end close to nipple, and slightly moveable.  2nd lump more like a seed and non moveable, is very small, and closer to sternum.   Both are in central, inner side of breast and 1 inch apart from eachother. Neither are partcurally large. I feel like I need to get into odd positions to really feel them, but this could be due to large breasts. I have also had this tingling/tickling feeling in my back on and off behind my left breast since last summer. Sometimes it is feeling more like pressure and a slight ache.  But I also have history of back pain and recently went to PT for this. However most of my PT related issues were in the neck and on the other side. This feeling is different than normal back pain.  Would also note I have been more tired than usual lately.  At first chalked it up to a long winter, but seems to be persisting. Most afternoons I need a nap.During workouts I have little energy and I cannot lift as heavy.   Love any advice on what to say to doctor.  If she says \"it's nothing I can hardly feel it\" should I push for tests? And if so what tests? Log in to post a reply",

I remember her saying the shape was abnormal.  I'm not sure if she meant each little speck, or the shape of the cluster it made.  I would say the shape of the cluster was like a rounded and slanted square.   This is my first mammogram as I am 35.  The surgeon did say that because they have nothing to compare it to, they need to biopsy, or I'd have to wait 6 months. He said if it's B9 they still want me back in 6 months for another mammo to be sure.  I did read that microcalcifications are NOT common in women under 50. Only 1 in 10 under 50.  So the fact that I have them, and it;s just one cluster... that doesn't sound great to me. :(  I also read that mammograms can find the calcifications better than tumors, especially in denser breasts.  Obviously the sand like appearance of the calcifications stands out.   I guess what concerns me most is the tingling and itching which nobody has anything to say about!  It's only on that side.  Maybe it's just coincidence. But I just feel like something is wrong. There is not flaking or redness that would denote a dermitolgical issue. ",

I recently had a mammo and US for a lump, which was rated Bi-rad 4.  Radiologist recommended biopsy and sent me to surgeon for opinion who said the same. Will be having stereotactic biopsy. The surgeon said he is not concerned, it's mostly likely benign, and if it is cancer it's early stage. However, MY concern is the lump. He says it's normal tissue.  But I am also rated as dense (not extremely, but still dense).  I'm so concerned there is something they cannot see in the mammo.  I saw the mammo images and it's mostly white and light gray, how could they see!   If there is no associated mass they are seeing, why would I only have this one cluster?
