I had surgery on one tumor and radiation on another. The neurosurgeon is seeing what he thinks is necrosis from the radiation. I've been having brain MRIs every two months and have another one in another six weeks. They will be adding on a spectroscopy again to, hopefully, confirm that what they are seeing is necrosis as opposed to a an active tumor. I am keeping my eye on what everyone's next steps have been post-Kadcyla. I hope that it will be effective for awhile as it is so tolerable. Greatly appreciate you being there. ",

I was originally diagnosed in June 2016, finished my year of Herceptin one year ago and was diagnosed with Brain Mets at the end of March of this year, so I'm still dealing with the shock. I will have my fourth cycle of Kadcyla this week. So far, I've tolerated it pretty well -- dry mouth and runny nose. My oncologist wants to do six cycles three weeks apart, but when I went to a well-regarded cancer center for a second opinion. They said that if I'm tolerating it well to stay on it 10-12 cycles and follow it with Herceptin. Now I'm reading here that some of you have been on it a lot longer. This may be a naive question, but do people stay on it until it no longer works? Seems like I need to revisit with my oncologist (who is knowledgeable and responsive).   ",

Your experience with Kadcyla gives me hope that I will have some time on it with success. Although it might be naive on my part, I hope that you will continue to have success with it.
