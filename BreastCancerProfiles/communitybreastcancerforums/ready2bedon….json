I retired just a week before I got my diagnosis, which was incredibly good timing since I didn't have to deal with the stress of work on top of everything else. Can you carpool to work or take Uber or something so you don't have to drive? Sounds like the driving is the worst part, and that should get better soon. I understand the brain fog though. I am off pain meds but would have a hard time doing anything that required me to actually think! I am almost 4 weeks post op from BMS & TE placement. My BS gave me a sheet of exercises to do, but the timing is unclear and I wasn't sure if I need to wait on them because of the expanders. I got my final drains out last week. At what point did you start doing range of motion exercises? I can lift both arms above my head if I do it slowly and gently, but if I do too much (as in just a few times), I get really sore and it keeps me awake at night. So I wasn't sure if it is too early. I suppose I need to ask my PS, but was wondering what the rest of you with similar surgeries have done. For the most part, pain-wise, I am doing pretty wellat this point except for the area right between my breasts where my incisions under them end and that areas really stings and hurts with a very sharp pain especially in the evenings and at night when I am trying to sleep. My bra doesn't rub there but even the slightest touch just about sends me through the roof. Is that nerve pain? I have a Rx for gabapentin and can take that without the awful constipating side effects of pain meds if that would help. Anyone else have this sort of pain there?",

I had my surgery 5 weeks ago so fairly close to yours. My PS gave me a very detailed packet with the timing for everything! He also seems somewhat rushed though when I see him for follow ups but his nurse is very good about answering my many questions I still have. You might want to try contacting your PS's nurse since they usually know the answers and are often better at communicating. I had a BMX with tissue expanders and drains so my instructions might be somewhat different. I would guess that a lumpectomy would heal faster and not have as many restrictions. My PS did tell me that I didn't have to sleep in a bra after 4 weeks (I am currently a 34 D) so you may be able to stop that. I have to sleep on my back for a few months though, ugh! It's actually pretty uncomfortable on my side anyway, I tried for a few minutes while reading in bed. As for bras, I was told no underwires, but I imagine it depends on where your incisions are. Mine are below my breasts mostly, so that makes sense. You do need good support, but since I have alloderm mesh, I can get away with a very soft sleep bra most of the time. I had to hunt for something that had a soft band that came down lower than most and wouldn't irritate my incisions. It may be a bit of trial and error to find what works for you and your needs. My PS didn't give me specifics about bras. I suspect that was out of his realm as a man. ðŸ˜€ I have weight restrictions for about 6 months since I have more surgeries for swapping out the expanders, creating nipples, etc. You may not have them past 6 weeks with a lumpectomy. I had a small lump removed several years ago and don't remember any restrictions after 48 hours. You might get.some better advice on the lumpectomy thread. Hopefully you can find someone who had very similar surgery who can share what their instructions were. Good luck!",

There was some back and forth on the tumor board about staging and whether or not to consider it as node involvement because it isn't an auxiliary node. The final conclusion is that they have to stage it as IIA because of the node, but as far as treatment goes, they are proceeding as if it were stage IA - no nodes. They just don't have a different way to classify intramammary node involvement. Because it was right next to the tumor, it isn't really metastasis. My guess is that your node that was involved is further away from the tumor and that is why you need radiation. Did you do the Oncotype DX? Mine came back as 10, which is low and means no chemo either. In answer to the original question, I see now in the final pathology report that it does say pT1c & pN1a - which means Tumor >10 mm but â‰¤20 mm in greatest dimension & Metastases in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes - which is equal to Stage IIA.",

In spite of being diagnosed with breast cancer and all the \"fun\" that went with that, overall this has been a very good year for me anyway. I got to go for a two week trip overseas with my oldest this summer and my second born got married! I was lucky and didn't need chemo or radiation and the worst side effect from the Letrozole is hot flashes which I had already. So, for most of the past 6 months, breast cancer was just a small bump in the road. That said, I had my tissue expanders swapped out for implants and fat grafting done a little over a week ago. I decided to have a tummy tuck done at the same time since my PS said the recovery would be the same as for the fat grafting alone that he would be taking from my belly. I think if I had just had the expanders swapped, I would feel almost completely normal by now. Instead, I feel very sore from my neck down pretty much! I am happier with the size of my breasts now, he had the expanders too large and I really hated how heavy they were. They had also dropped about 2 inches in the 5 months since I got them, so I got a lift as well back to where the girls should be. Since he opened me up from underneath along the original scar lines, he was able to remove the excess skin and tighten everything up. Obviously things are still a bit lumpy from the fat grafting but I am really happy about how much more natural they look and feel compared to the expanders. On the other hand, I have swelling even with my breast under my right armpit from the surgery about the size of an egg which is a bit uncomfortable and pushes my breast towards the middle somewhat. On the left, I have a huge hematoma from my armpit to my waist that is hard as a rock and the swelling is the size of half a cantaloupe. Very uncomfortable and it makes everything look distorted and misshapen. My breast on that side is also squished towards the center. I am really hoping this goes away soon! I look a bit montrous right now. My birthday suit is one scary Halloween costume! The tummy tuck was way more painful than I expected! However, I think I will be pleased with the final results there as well. I had lost 140 lbs so I had a lot of loose skin that kept me from looking nice even in clothes. But for now, I am very sore, sick of dealing with drains again, tired of sleeping on my back but almost 2 full months of that still. I really shouldn't complain though. Things could have all gone so much worse this year and I really do have much to be grateful for! ",

I think that is normal since they've disturbed the healing for a bit. If you still have swelling by Monday, I would call. Kae, I am a little over 2 weeks out and still pretty dependent on help. You can't drive until you have full range of motion and no pain meds for 48 hours. Although I quit taking pain meds two days after surgery, I've had to again after drain removal and I am sure I'll need to again when I get the remaining ones removed next week. If you have fills to your TE, you may also need pain meds longer, which delays when you can drive again. I have pretty good range of motion because my TEs were just placed under the skin not under muscle. Even still it isn't easy reaching to get something from a cabinet. I cooked dinner last night with help and was very sore afterwards and felt like I had done too much. So, I just speaking from my experience, I'd say at least 3-4 weeks of help would be greatly appreciated. I don't anticipate feeling like I can do all the normal everyday things on my own (within the 5 lb lifting limitations) until about 6 weeks.",

The only thing that I would add is to call your doctor and ask for a copy of your biopsy report. You'll have a lot more information on it that might help you make a decision. My circumstances are different from yours. I am in my late 50s and my boobs were very saggy and sad looking so I had decided back years ago when I had a breast cancer scare that turned out to be benign that if I ever did get a malignant diagnosis, I would go for bilateral mastectomies and reconstruction. For me, getting new perky boobs was the silver lining in this. I also did not want radiation if I could avoid it since it would make reconstruction a bit more challenging. (I never even thought about it being near my heart!) If I had chosen to have a lumpectomy, I was told by my oncologist that I would need radiation. I am a little over a month postop and am very happy with my choice. I was lucky and don't need radiation or chemo. I also had my husband here to help me but honestly, I would have been fine alone after the first few days.",

I since lost 140 lbs and the numbness disappeared. Until now. I suspect that it is either the swelling or the tissue expander putting pressure again on that nerve and hopefully will resolve on its own. Of course the numb chest is a different issue but I am encouraged to read your stories.",

(It's IIA as a technicality, but they are treating it as IA.) My MRI & bone scan were also clear. I really sweated it our waiting on the bone scan results since my MRI showed a suspicious area on my breast bone. So I know how hard the wait is! But all turned out very well for me and I hope it does for you as well.",

My post op instructions included lifting nothing heavier than 3 lbs for the first 3 months, then 5 lbs for two months, etc - and then I had my implants swap in October and was finally given approval to exercise in January. I joined the local rec center and started off with gentle stuff like yoga and have progressed already to more intensive exercise (with small weights for now) without any issues. I never knew I would be so happy to be able to exercise again!! It sounds like doctors are all over the board with recommendations about restrictions on exercise postop! And of course, I am sure it varies a lot depending on what surgery you had done - expanders, implants, lymph nodes, prepectoral, etc. I assume even breast size makes some difference as I imagine when to begin jogging with large implants would have to wait longer than someone with much smaller ones because of the weight and strain they would be on the pocket?",

If so, it will go away on its own in a week or two. If it doesn't, I would also suggest you continue to ask for verification as to what it is.",
