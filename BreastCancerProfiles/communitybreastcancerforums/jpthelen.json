Now I am scheduled for a SNB in a few day. I am extremely scared that this may have gotten into my blood stream. Anybody else go through this? Can anyone tell me if the SNB shots are painful? I am not sure if they will take more nodes if they find cancer in the SN? I hope they do but of course I hope that the SN is clean and I can go on with my radiation treatment, the possibility of chemo really, really scares me!",
