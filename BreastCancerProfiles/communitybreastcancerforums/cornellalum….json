What kind of care will I need after coming home, and for how long?  Are home nursing visits an option for the first few days to ensure that I can provide appropriate after-care (attending to drains, changing bandages, etc.)? What kind of things should I be looking for after coming home (signs of infection, pain, etc.)?  What is their experience with Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome, and how do they treat it if it happens?   What kind of exercises/stretching can you do to start to regain Range-of-Motion (ROM) in your arms right after surgery?  What is the best way to contact them after surgery with questions/concerns?  When will pathology results be available? These are just a few that I had.  There are probably lots more. I took a list, and crossed off stuff as either they talked about it, or I asked.  And some of the information they gave me generated more questions.  You want to ask these questions at the pre-admit, since you will probably still be on some pretty good painkillers after the surgery, and will find it hard to concentrate on the billion instructions they give you when they discharge you. Make sure whoever comes with you is taking notes. If I think of more, I'll post again. The most important thing is to realize that you have hired them, they work for you, and they need to answer all your questions to your satisfaction.  Never, never hesitate to ask a question. Good luck to you.",

What surgical clips?\" Surgeon: \"We use them during surgery to stop bleeding.\"  Me: \"And you leave them in???\"  Surgeon: \"Yes, scar tissue builds up around them. Sometimes it takes a few months.  It will stop hurting soon.\"  Me:  \"What if it doesn't stop hurting?\" Surgeon: \"It will. It can take up to six months sometimes.\" I looked up the website of one of the companies that makes these clips, and it claims that they are much more effective than sutures.  Fewer complications, quicker healing, etc.  But you know, you gotta wonder whether they are just easier and quicker for the surgeon.
