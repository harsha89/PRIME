The surgeon felt the lump and after manipulating it for a few he siad \"yea its a fibroadenoma, its about a cm it moves very easily\".......blah blah blah. So I asked well then why didn't it show on you/s. He says because its made up of normal breast tissue so the ultrasound couldn't tell the differance. I'm not sure how confident I am in that explanation but whatever. He said he felt totally comfortable waiting 6 months or he can remove it. I opted for removal. I'm assumeing they will biopsy the lump after removal but not sure. Although I feel better I'm not totally at ease. Its funny I prayed and asked god for reassurance, clear conclusive as possible dx from doc today and to in the end know 100% it was benign. I feel like god is trying to give me all of those things, so why do I keep allowing myself worry? Anyways, has anyone ever had a lump not show on us and it was a fibroadenoma? Also I was wondering, if it being a cm may make it to small to be seen or is that avg size? Oh and although mine is VERY movable it does not feel like a marble like I've read. Has anyone had one and can you tell me specifically how it felt to you? Log in to post a reply",

Then said something about a rash that I don't have...I'm so frustrated, I just want to know. Is this scar tissue? Is it normal for the area excised to be firm? Is that a normal part of the healing process? And could that cause that area of skin to wrinkle? Or do I need to go back tell him give me another d*mn bx cuz I dnt trust the first one?

I'm no expert...nor have I been diagnosed with anything but I've read other ppls post and those are the test theylve had with symptoms similar to urs. Where are you located can you go to another city near by that may have a breast center you can get into more quickly? Have you tried calling breast surgeons urself instead of waiting on the doctor. That's what I did, I learned when you want something done on ur time you have to do it urself! Of course I did not need a referrel. Good luck...I'm sure more...much more informative advice will be on its way very soon! Good luck and don't worry, you will be ok!",

Originally this area felt full with fluid but then became hard...the entire area that was removed. The incision was made around my areola but the lump was at 9 o clock half way between areola and edge of outter breast...and if this could be scar tissue can scar tissue cause wrinkling/puckering/gathering or however you describe it. The area is still bruised also. I want to mention that I never had any of these symptoms until after the surgery...I noticed the hardness first and then wrinkling in the same area following...my areola is also shaped differantly now. Could this just be from the surgery? Sorry to all of you who are just starting this journey who really need the support right and to those of you who are going through the grueling waiting period!

Just a little advice, if ur insurance will allow skip the ob or gp...go straight to a breast specialist, if you can a dr. That specializes or is very familiar with ibc. It very well could be a b9 condition but cancer comes in many differant forms and if this were to be ibc treatment CANNOT be put off.  Maybe you should post on the ibc forum, read through some of the threads, specifically the one when they tell their stories about how they were dx. you will see evryones story is unique. Ok, well sorry if I seem pushy I just think it is so important for us to be very aggressive when it comes to breast health! Good luck and please post and give us updates!!",

Keep busy, come here anytime you need encouragement and yes 80% of lumps are benign!! Did ur doctor give you a percentage? If you start feeling really anxious you can call the doc office and they can call you in some meds for the nerves!! Good luck!!",
