    "Content": "Laus wrote: Hi there, I am 38 years old and have recently had Bilateral Ultrasound and the results were at 9 o'clock position 1cm from nipple area 3mm cyst.  No solid nodule is present.  Right breast is moderately dense due to glandular tissue and ductal prominence.   Left Breast at 11 o'clock position 3cm from nipple area there is a 7 x 3 x 3mm hypoechoic nodule.  Findings suggest either a fibroadenoma or a prominent fatty lobule.  If indicated this could be further reviewed on FNA. Mammogram results showed normal mixture of fibrofatty and glandular tissue between 25 - 50% There are no discrete mass lesions and no radiological evidence of carcinoma. My doctor said there is no need for a biopsy as lumps are too small and request i have another physical breast examination in 2 weeks. Should i leave it as that or maybe get a second opinion...or do i wait till for a couple of years till the lumps get bigger...or am i just being paranoid?  Log in to post a reply",
