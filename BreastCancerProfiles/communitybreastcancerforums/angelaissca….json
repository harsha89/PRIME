So far I've had a mammogram, ultrasound all clear. Then I got an MRI which came back \"highly suspicious\". OMG Panic set in! I was scheduled for a biopsy last Friday and the ultrasound showed no mass but an area which was grey and hypoechoic. Radiologist felt it was an infection  or post traumatic injury and I am on antibiotics. I go to see breast surgeon today and next Friday another ultrasound. I have no children so I was sure I did not have an infection! But we just don't know. Follow up with your doc and demand further investigation. My original doc told me there was no  indication of infection because I wasn't red but it felt so painful it brought tears to my eyes!  Still unsure of what it was or is but my symptoms greatly improved. Hang in there!!  I know easier said than done. I was in such a bad place last week mentally so I know how you feel. CALL your doc for follow up! Angela",

      "Content": "Sep 12, 2014 08:40PM - edited Sep 12, 2014 10:04PM by angelaisscared I'm happy to hear they do not suspect cancer! I have also received confusing news today after a two hour ultrasound which was supposed to be biopsied but since they could not find a discrete mass they sent me home with a two week course of antibiotics and rescheduled ultrasound in two weeks with possibility of biopsy. I'm so confused bc I had a palpable lump and a highly suspicious MRI. This all started with excruciating breast pain for two weeks (now resolved) and some nipple discharge on expression and nipple starting to invert. Almost sounds similar to you!  I just want this chapter closed but I'd also like answers!  Hope you find yours answers too. I apparently have some hyperechoic grey area on ultrasound but that's all they could see after all that time on the table. I'm thrilled, I think!? Angela",

I don't know what the healthcare system is like in England but doctors take an oath and one of them has to feel enough compassion that they will help you. Do not give up! You are the only one who can keep on fighting for your health! Please! Angela",
