I likened it to yellow jacket stings.  I would have preferred four shots at once so wouldn't have the anguish of anticipation of the next 3.  I also had the old blue dye which is not used anymore and it cause a lot of necrosis in my breast and the scar is disfiguring.  I'm glad that they don't do either of things anymore but still grateful that they had the test instead of taking a clump of nodes.   Good luck to all and hope you have smooth sailing ahead.
