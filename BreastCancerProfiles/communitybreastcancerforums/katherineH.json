I had my port put in last week and I'm ready when the Dr. is ready. I've been reading a lot of information and have found it to be really helpful. I would like to work while I'm on chemo, but my Dr. said she would prefer that I not because of the risk for infections but I think I will see how the first treatment goes. Once again--- thanks for the encouragement.",
