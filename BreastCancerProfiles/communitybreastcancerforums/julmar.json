Especially with such a young child who has rarely been apart from me. I'm finding this hard, much harder than when I had the two lumps removed 20 odd years ago",

Now aged 40, I have found dimpling of the breast, I see it when I lift my arm up - my breast has an almost straight edge to it which indents. I went to the GP on Tuesday and was called today by the breast clinic and told my mammogram would be a week on Monday (20th) and any tests would also be done that day. I am absolutely petrified. Previous lumps, not having my first child until two and half years ago (after age 30), my maternal grandmother having had a masectomy. I'm fearing the worst. My left hip hurts so much - has done for a while. I was diagnosed with degenerative lumbar disease and keep wondering if I indeed do have breast cancer that has infact spread to the bones. I often feel sick, light headed, suffer bad headaches and I'm so so scared. The wait for the mammogram is agonising.  I'm sorry for the long post, I just don't know who to turn to or what to do or think right now :( Log in to post a reply",
