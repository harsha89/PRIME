      "Content": "Apr 28, 2018 03:33AM - edited Apr 28, 2018 03:30PM by LMS I had my mammogram 8 months after radiation ended. (Stage 1A Grade 3 HER+) I went to my radiologist/oncologist a week later and he told me that my breast was pink and warm to the touch (The mammogram was normal by the way). He put me on Keflex 250 mg. 4 x daily. It didn't work. I saw my surgeon who put me on Keflex 500 mg. 3 x per day - it didn't work. My breast swelling goes down when I lie in bed at night and it gets cooler. Surgeon tried needle aspiration (5 times) in the office. Didn't get anything out. Sent a sample for a culture which came back negative. I saw my oncologist and he prescribed Levaquin (500 mg 1 x per day). That didn't work. Had an ultrasound that showed I had a cyst or abscess on the lumpectomy scar (7 cm). This all happened after the mammogram. Now my surgeon wants to do a biopsy of my breast skin and a core biopsy of the \"cyst\". If it's a cyst, why would they do a core biopsy? I had played this waiting game last year when I got breast cancer and now it's the same thing over again. I'm waiting for them to set up the biopsy appointment now. I just keep wondering when this nightmare is going to end. Asked my surgeon if the mammogram caused this and he said it was just a coincidence. (My oncologist seemed to think there were germs on the mammogram machine). I am a complete emotional wreck over this. They have the diagnosis as cellulitis and another doctor called it a seroma. Am not taking antibiotics for now. The surgeon wanted to use general anesthesia for the biopsy and I told him absolutely not. I did the first biopsy without it. He claimed that I had anxiety. He's now going to give me a form of \"twilight\" sleep while doing the procedure. They've got me on Xanax and I'm still a nervous wreck. Has anyone had this happen to them a year after their surgery? Of course I can't get any answers from anyone and have to Google everything (which is not good either).",

      "Content": "LMS wrote: I finished radiation treatment last August (2017). I was doing fine until my mammogram, which I had done this past April. A week after my mammogram, my breast got swollen, and hot. My radiologist/oncologist claims it was a coincidence (I think not). He put me on antibiotics. Saw my oncologist who put me on different antibiotics, then my surgeon who again put me on antibiotics claiming I had cellulitis. Went through this for a month Had to have another surgery this past May 2018. Surgeon did a skin punch biopsy and went in where the scar tissue was, biopsied that and also drained a seroma. Went back last week to the radiologist/oncologist who wrote a script for an anti-inflammatory drug (my breast is about 90% better now). Asked him about interactions with other meds I'm on. He said the pharmacy would know. Well, I looked it up and there are serious side effects when taking this with my blood pressure medication. I never picked up the medication (I called Walgreens and left a message). Got a call back that my medication was ready! I am so frustrated with these doctors and pharmacies right now. I was on Anastrozole for about 5 months and the side effects were horrendous. Oncologist put me on Exemestane last December and the side effects seem to be getting worse lately. Called the oncologist and told him I needed to take a break. All he did was prescribe yet another drug and told me to take that. I can't seem to catch a break with these doctors. All they want to do is prescribe medication and could care less of how you feel. Has anyone had problems with radiation like this? I've gotten to the point that I don't trust any doctor anymore. It's as if they could care less. You're just a number to them. Am very frustrated and depressed over this.
