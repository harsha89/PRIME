The question now is to determine whether the chemo treatments are helping any?  Or are they hurting?  Also, the need for so many pain medications and the high dosages lead me to believe that the Chemo may not necessarily be eradicating the cancer.  I will definitely check out the cites that you both mentioned and thank you.  Please keep her in your prayers. ",
