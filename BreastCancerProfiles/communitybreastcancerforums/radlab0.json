Doc confirmed that it felt strange, and now I have a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound scheduled for Tuesday morning. I'm really scared and sad. Every time I feed my daughter (she's just 10 weeks old), I wonder if this will be one of the last few feedings, if I'll have to wean and bottle feed. The thought of losing that closeness and comfort that only I can provide is just heartbreaking. Log in to post a reply",

Just altogether too much attention on the boobs right now. May I ask how your cancer first presented? Are you still doing the chemo and radiation treatments described in your sig? Prayers and positive thoughts for you and your family, as well!",

Obviously I'll pump before the appointment tomorrow, but I have this insane worry that they will turn me away or fail to take me seriously because I won't be able to find it for them. Ah well. Hoping my little girl will let me get some sleep tonight. Hoping my older daughter (she turned 3 in April) won't be too hard on her dad while he flies solo with both girls tomorrow. It'll be the longest he's spent on his own with both! I'm so glad you've completed your treatments and have the chance to enjoy your kids!",
