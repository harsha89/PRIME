Was diagnosed at 49 w/ Stage 1 /PR+ HER2- 0/nodes.  Lumpectomy on 4/14/08 followed by Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation of upper quadrant (2x day for 5 days very high dose equivalent to 6 week treatment plan).  Medical oncologist weighed pros and cons w/ tamoxifen and we decided the side effects were not worth the couple percentage points I would gain. I was already post-menopausal. I do not recommend the radiation treatment I had. I was not given all the facts regarding side effects. 3 months after treatment ended I developed severe pain from breast bone around to spine and up into shoulder. Radiation doctor diagnosed it as bone inflammation.  I managed the pain but then in June 09 I developed shortness of breath, pain when sneezing or coughing. My radiation doctor refused to see me. I went to chiropractor, walk-in clinic and ended up in emergency room in a 2 week time period.  My condition has worsened over the last 18 months. I am unable to do my normal activities without shortness of breath and pain in treated area. I recently went to a new family doctor and found out I have severe radiation burn and probably  fibrosis throughout treated area. He wants to do bone scan and ct scan to rule out bone cancer since I have experienced pain for so long.  Hope you have an excellent team of doctors that are willing to provide you with complete information regarding treatment options. Best of luck to you and your family.    P.S. what is BLMX and what meds. r u taking?",
