We are just very uncomfortable about a proceedure that we have never heard of plus cannot find anyone who has had it. All the doctors we have seen say surgicaly remove it because it is right next to the skull and you will know if it is cancer or not. A radiation oncologist says use SRS to remove it. We are very very confused!!!",
