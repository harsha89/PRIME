I have two fibroid nodes that got so big that the blood supply was cut off, they died and shriveled up, showing two masses in my right breast. I have two sisters with DCIS... I was certain it was my turn... with all of my heart and prayers, I wish each and every person reading this post HOPE, LOVE, and PEACE in their hearts until and final result or ultimate cure is within their reach. Stay strong, we all make a difference, Amen <3",
