    "Content": "Oct 7, 2007 07:57AM - edited Oct 7, 2007 07:58AM by janlyn I had my bil mast on 08/28 with tissue expanders. I had planned on the reconstruction when I was done w/ chemo (one node +) But I'm not sure I can afford to take any more time off work. I may op for the implants. Especially after one of the nurses who took care of me (a BC survivor) showed me her new implants. Amazing how natural they looked and like a 20 year old! And a very short recovery. My only reservation is that I have heard that they can become hard if they get calcification around them. I know I have plenty of time before I decide. I would love to hear from others who have had implants and if they are satisfied. Janet",
