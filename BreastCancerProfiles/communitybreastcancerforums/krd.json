My onc. said if it would come back it would do so between the 2 and 5 yr.  Unlike other cancers this is slow moving.  However, if you make it to 5 yrs. out your chance would be at 1%.  The best thing I was told to do was to excercise and eat lots of fruit and veg.  Avoid fat...I know several women who have made it and are all out for over 12 years.  They still think about breast cancer coming back...just not as often anymore. I am not sure if you have heard about the news out about the radio waves.They would kill any cancer as small or large it would be by injecting some nano somethings that caner likes and then then radio waves burns them.  This is something that is out there, but has worked on mice and rats...hope they move quick on this one.  I was also told that u of Ind. is very close...I pray that they are for all of us. The odds are in our favor, hang in there!
