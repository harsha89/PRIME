Also, do you gals wear a mastectomy sports bra ...  or just a regular sports bra.  If you use a regular sports bra, how do you keep the form in place?",

If this snow ever stops, I'm going to go try it on.  My natural breast is not very big, so maybe the pad on the left side will be enough.  If not, I have a lightweight foam form that might work.  It sounds like a great bra from your description, so I sure hope the sizing works for me!  Thanks again.",
