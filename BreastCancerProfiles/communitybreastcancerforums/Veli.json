They have confirmed cancer (stage 3 I think since I couldn't really take everything in) in my breast and lymph nodes. I will have an MRI on Thursday, surgery in 2 weeks and then radiotherapy for 12 weeks and chemo for a year. I am a little shocked but glad that I have this great team behind me that already know what they want to do and are not wasting any time.",

      "Content": "Veli wrote: Hello, I am 35 with no children and felt a hard lump in my right breast about 2 months ago. I thought it was just a lump that would go away but it never did. I went to my doctor that referred me to a breast clinic, I was examined then sent to get a mammogram, straight after the mammogram I was sent for an ultrasound. During the ultrasound they decided they wanted a biopsy as the found another mass in my breast and one in my armpit. Did the biopsy in all 3 areas and they put titanium markers in the areas then I was sent for a second mammogram and then waited for the specialist to see me. When I walked into the office it was the specialist with 2 cancer nurses in there and the specialist said they have concerns. Asking questions if I am sure I have no family history several times and also asking about my future plans on where I want treatment as I am a Swede living in Ireland. They did not give me any other information and I am now waiting on my results, got an appointment for Thursday this week. Has anyone else done all these procedures during one day and not even an indication on what it can be? Thankful for any advice you can give me! Log in to post a reply",
