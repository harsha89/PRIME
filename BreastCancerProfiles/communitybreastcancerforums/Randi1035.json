I had been on HRT (estrogen) for 14 years and the shock of an Estrogen blocker right after they took away my HRT was hard! They upped my dose of Prozac (from 20 to 40mg) to try to mitigate (there is some evidence that anti-depressants help with hot flashes) but I began to feel weird. A friend of our family is an oncologist (my mom had ovarian cancer, my sister died of breast cancer at 44) She said I should give myself a break, let my body adjust, and quit the letrizole until AFTER the RADS so that's what I did. My MO is a detatched young woman who seems like she'd rather be anywhere but in her office. Glad I have my family onc to talk to. If she wasn't so far away, I'd totally be in her care.",

Tamoxifin and Paxil/Prozac and a whole bunch of anti-depressants don't work together. My ONC wanted to prescribe Effexor for me too. I told her I was on Prozac and she said \"take both.\" Then, my Internist told me \"NO.\" My internist didn't know what to do so she said \"double up on the Prozac.\" I am on Letrozol not Tamoxifin because I am post menopausal (had a hysterectomy 14 years ago). Anyway, the Prozac made me feel really weird, forgetful, confused and blah. I'm tapering off now. But I will have to figure something out once RADS are over and I have to go back on some aromatase inhibitor. So, IF ANYONE takes EFFEXOR can you share your experience with it? I know all of us are different, but I'd love to know if it's very strong or barely noticeable in the low dose they prescribe for Hot Flashes. 40mg of Prozac and me don't get along and I feel hungry all the time. Gained 4 pounds already. I don't know why we have to become experts in everything from wound care to anti-depressants but sadly we do. The docs when they're good are fabulous, and when they're just okay they're dangerous.",

GOOGLE and found out that Silvadene is great for that. Asked for a script and schmeared it VERY THICK on my breast and armpit twice a day. The whole area improved in about a week. WHY they didn't tell me about Silvadene is beyond me, but this whole experience (except for the techs - great young girls with an amazing bedside manner) was more or less going to the RAD FACTORY every day. HERE ARE SOME THINGS I FOUND THAT REALLY REALLY HELPED: 100% pure Aloe at the beginning followed by a lot of Aquaphor every night. Then, when you start to burn ask for Silvadene. If you are itchy get a script for Cortisone. There is an alchohol free astringent called DOMEBORO powder. You mix a packet with 2 cups of water and refrigerate it. Dip a soft cloth into the solution and place across breast for 15 minutes once or twice a day (if you have time, at night if you don't. Do it while laying down) It's kinda shocking because it's very very cold, so prepare yourself, but the cloth will get HOT really quick once it starts absorbing the heat from your breast. For the HOT FLASHES: Try Remiferin PURE Black Cohosh, not the kind with Soy. I use 20 mg in the morning. At night I take 20 mg regular Remiferin and 1 20 mg Remiferin GoodNight with Meletonin. Keeps the night sweats down to maybe 1 or 2 (I was having 10 or more) GET SOME ARCITC COOL TOWELS from Amazon. Buy 2 for $12.00 They really really help the Hot Flashes pass quickly. You just wet them, wring them out, snap it and wear it. Stays cold for 2 hours and it isn't soaking wet, just damp. Have one by your bed. When you have night sweats, place it across your chest. Carry the other one with you during the day. Also, put some cabbage leaves in a Zip Lock bag in the fridge and put them on when you're on fire. Hope this helps someone get through it. I'm going to start the Femara tonight. I didn't take them while doing Rads.",

Yes, sometimes I wish I had a mastectomy too. Don't worry. You're not alone with that thought... I saw on the Moderators page that CABBAGE leaves are good for redness, burning, etc. You peel the leaves, wash them and put them in the fridge. Once cool you put them over your breast. Also saw these tips. Regularly dust the breast area and inside skin folds with cornstarch to absorb moisture, reduce friction, and keep you smelling fresh. You can use baby powder made from cornstarch (don't use talc) or sifted kitchen cornstarch. Apply it with a clean makeup brush or put some cornstarch into a single knee-high nylon or thin sock and knot it at the top. Gently tap the sock against the skin to dust the surface. If your doctor has recommended using creams or salves, apply those first, then dust the area with the cornstarch.",
