Latest research data shows that Aromasin is a very effective drug and may be slightly better than the other hormonals.  They all work in a different way so side effects from one may not necessarily be the same in another.  I believe the hormonals are a very important tool in preventing recurrences in ER/PR+  cancers.  I hope you also find Aromasin easier to take with less side effects like I do and can heal up quickly from the Baker's Cyst.",

Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2010 Jul;91(7):1070-6. Katz E, Dugan NL, Cohn JC, Chu C, Smith RG, Schmitz KH. Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. Here is the Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of recruiting and retaining cancer survivors with lower-limb lymphedema into an exercise intervention study. To develop preliminary estimates regarding the safety and efficacy of this intervention. We hypothesized that progressive weight training would not exacerbate leg swelling and that the intervention would improve functional mobility and quality of life. DESIGN: Before-after pilot study with a duration of 5 months. SETTING: University of Pennsylvania. PARTICIPANTS: Cancer survivors with a known diagnosis of lower-limb lymphedema (N=10) were directly referred by University of Pennsylvania clinicians. All 10 participants completed the study. INTERVENTION: Twice weekly slowly progressive weight lifting, supervised for 2 months, unsupervised for 3 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was interlimb volume differences as measured by optoelectronic perometry. Additional outcome measures included safety (adverse events), muscle strength, objective physical function, and quality of life. RESULTS: Interlimb volume differences were 44.4% and 45.3% at baseline and 5 months, respectively (pre-post comparison, P=.70). There were 2 unexpected incident cases of cellulitis within the first 2 months. Both resolved with oral antibiotics and complete decongestive therapy by 5 months. Bench and leg press strength increased by 47% and 27% over 5 months (P=.001 and P=.07, respectively). Distance walked in 6 minutes increased by 7% in 5 months (P=.01). No improvement was noted in self-reported quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Recruitment of patients with lower-limb-lymphedema into an exercise program is feasible. Despite some indications that the intervention may be safe (eg, a lack of clinically significant interlimb volume increases over 5 mo), the unexpected finding of 2 cellulitic infections among the 10 participants suggests additional study is required before concluding that patients with lower-extremity lymphedema can safely perform weight lifting.

I generally give my skin a break of a day or two after removing the tape.  I also tend to tape as little or as much as I feel is needed at the time.  During hot summer months I have more problems with fluid collection under the arm and down my side so I tend to tape more in warmer months. When I get a chance I may try to add a pictoral for taping the arm which might be of more interest to others.  Not everyone has problems with LE in their hand like I do, so certainly they should only be taping the symptomatic areas.",

Survivors continue to face challenges and must learn to deal with the ongoing effects of cancer long after formal treatments are completed. Heather's intent was to spotlight a few individuals with different cancers and have them share their personal journeys.  I contacted Heather after seeing a request for interested cancer survivors to respond.  Heather was gracious and very open to learning more about lymphedema.  We spoke on the phone for over an hour and I sent her many LE links with resource information.  Heather later informed me that she had decided to include my story as one of the 4 survivors to be spotlighted. I received a rough draft in the summer and the final Fall magazine edition was released just a couple of weeks ago. I was thrilled to see that they used the photos I sent and I feel Heather did a great job of highlighting many important aspects of lymphedema.  I told her how active our LE forum was here at BC.org and how often our ladies feel lymphedema is ignored by the mainstream media. I was very grateful and knew you all would be too for her willingness to show the compression garments and to allow me to try to be a voice for our LE community. I just heard from Heather yesterday that I would be allowed to post a PDF I made of the article.  She asked that I include here in this post the following disclaimer: Reprinted with permission from H2U-Health to You.

      "Content": "Apr 21, 2010 01:33PM - edited Apr 21, 2010 01:36PM by LindaLou53 Hi Annadou, I have found the most effective treatment of hand swelling to be inserting pads either inside or on top of your garments whenever you can.  I wear a JoviPak nighttime garment that has dorsum and palmar pads built into it and this helps to reduce my hand swelling alot overnight.   The hand is very difficult to treat because of its shape.  With a standard compression glove it is almost impossible to get adequate compression over the dorsum and palmar areas because of the concave shape of the palm.  If you try wrapping bandages more tightly over the hand without using pads you will cause too much compression on the sides of your hands and still not have adequate compression on the palm.  If you are wrapping with short stretch bandages, the goal is trying to create an oval shape by building up the center of the hand so that it is about as wide as the width of your hand. Here is a picture of my hand being wrapped by Steve Norton at one of his Norton School LE certification training courses in 2006.  We used a palmar Swell Spot for my palm and a dorsum Swell Spot for the back of my hand.    We then applied custom cut sections of yellow foam to continue to build up the center of the hand before finally wrapping with short stretch bandages.  The final result looking at a cross section is more of an oval shape so that compression can be applied evenly around the hand including the palm.  This works great at night or if you can stay home and not have to be very physically active.  But obviously the function of your wrapped hand is very limited with this type of bandaging.  For daytime purposes when I still need use of my hand I will sometimes just stick a dorsum pad inside my glove or wrap a dorsum pad outside my glove using short stretch bandaging to hold it in place.  As long as my palm is not heavily padded I have full use of my hand for gripping things like the steering wheel, door knobs etc. Another option is to have your compression glove custom made with both dorsum and palmar insertable pads that slip into pockets in the glove.  These pads are much thinner to wear for daytime use and yet provide more compression than the the glove fabric alone.

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote: Hi Ladies, I have been wanting to post a pictorial of visible signs of LE for some time now. I finally took some time yesterday to take comparison photos of my LE and NON-LE hand and arm. It was no easy task to position one arm while holding the camera with the other but I hope some of you will find these helpful. Just a few comments up front to be clear. LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted. Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however, that could be detected by specialized tools such as perometry or Bio Impedence units. This is why it is so important for women at risk for LE to be aware of these early warning signs and get evaluation as soon as possible by a certified LE therapist. Please do not wait for swelling to be visible before being evaluated if you are already having concerns with discomfort, a sense of heaviness, fullness or achyness. Once we have visible signs of swelling it may be easier to convince the physicians and other medical professionals that we have LE but even then our unique symptoms may be attributed to other potential medical conditions. There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis. One other point I want to stress is that everyone's LE is unique in its presentation. My LE will not be exactly like your LE. We may share many common aspects though, so I feel it can be helpful to show visual images of LE. I post these images purely for informational/educational reasons and just as an EXAMPLE of how LE may present. I wanted to emphasize the comparisons beween a LE and NON-LE limb to make you all aware of some of the more subtle changes you should keep an eye out for when trying to detect your own LE. As a quick personal history note, I have had LE for 4 years in my left arm and hand with minimal truncal LE. My right arm is at risk for LE but has not yet shown visible signs. My LE is considered Stage 2 because it does not revert to normal with elevation or garments. I have never had large volume differences between my arms. I do have a fair amount of fibrosis and swelling primarily in my hand which results in diminshed strength, flexibility and fine motor skills of that hand. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all! The photos that LindaLou originally and so graciously shared here are no longer available on the hosting site. Before her passing, she also shared the photos on another site, which we are linking here. For examples of what signs to look for, please click the following link to view LindaLou's original images: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/What_does_lymphedem... These first two photos are comparisons of my left and right hand and forearms. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of the back (dorsum) of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of palmar side of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here the constriction of joints and decreased flexibility can be seen in the left hand. (see Mod note) Another test of flexibility of the hand joints is to try to touch your thumb to your pinky finger and make the Boyscout sign. Remember that if you already have joint stiffness due to arthritis or medications you may not be able to do this. Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different. Learn what is a change for your own body, pay close attention to the characteristics and location of any swelling. Be able to point out these subtle changes to your doctor or therapist so they can determine the best treatment for you. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

If you are experiencing swelling that cannot easily be attributed to your chemo or other conditions, you should consider getting an evaluation from a qualified LE therapist.  Better to rule out LE early and find the real cause of the swelling, or if it is LE the sooner you start treatments the better. How to Find a Qualified LE Therapist Let us know how it goes.",

Regarding exercise, the Healthy Steps Program (formerly known as LeBed) is a great exercise program for LE.  Many local Wellness Communities or cancer centers may offer free Healthy Steps exercise groups. If you don't want to attend the group sessions you can also buy the DVD and exercise on your own at home.  The exercise is fun, easy to do, and not too strenuous for your LE.  Here is a link to the website DVD/Book store: www.lebedmethod.com/store/?pro...",

They might be a little more bulky for daytime wear though. For someone who is a fan of the original Star Trek series and a firm believer in future technology, I won't be surprised if one day they develop some type of \"force field\" around our body that can invisibly apply just the right amount of compression as needed!  Lol...if they can ever do that though, I would hope they could certainly figure out how to prevent LE altogether by then! ",

Studies have now shown that the earlier your LE is diagnosed and the sooner you start proper treatment and management, the better your chances of keeping your LE well controlled and mild.  In some cases there is even evidence of reversing early onset LE after a period of proper treatment.  If it turns out you do have LE, you will need to have a discussion with your surgeon regarding the impact reconstruction may have on your LE and vice versa.  You should be well informed of the potential risks of any procedure as it relates to LE. Be sure you check out the STEP UP - SPEAK OUT website which has tons of information and links you will need. Here is info on finding a qualified lymphedema therapist: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin... Check out the NLN for their position papers on Risk Reduction, Treatment, Air Travel and Exercise: www.lymphnet.org/ I know it is hard enough dealing with a cancer dx and treatments but early symptoms of LE should not be ignored.  Full evaluation and proper treatment now can make all the difference in the amount of time and effort needed for future management. Let us know how it goes for you.  Come to this LE forum often to ask questions or just read up on all the valuable information you will find here. Best Wishes, LindaLou",

LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted. Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however, that could be detected by specialized tools such as perometry or Bio Impedence units. This is why it is so important for women at risk for LE to be aware of these early warning signs and get evaluation as soon as possible by a certified LE therapist. Please do not wait for swelling to be visible before being evaluated if you are already having concerns with discomfort, a sense of heaviness, fullness or achyness. Once we have visible signs of swelling it may be easier to convince the physicians and other medical professionals that we have LE but even then our unique symptoms may be attributed to other potential medical conditions. There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis. One other point I want to stress is that everyone's LE is unique in its presentation. My LE will not be exactly like your LE. We may share many common aspects though, so I feel it can be helpful to show visual images of LE. I post these images purely for informational/educational reasons and just as an EXAMPLE of how LE may present. I wanted to emphasize the comparisons beween a LE and NON-LE limb to make you all aware of some of the more subtle changes you should keep an eye out for when trying to detect your own LE. As a quick personal history note, I have had LE for 4 years in my left arm and hand with minimal truncal LE. My right arm is at risk for LE but has not yet shown visible signs. My LE is considered Stage 2 because it does not revert to normal with elevation or garments. I have never had large volume differences between my arms. I do have a fair amount of fibrosis and swelling primarily in my hand which results in diminshed strength, flexibility and fine motor skills of that hand. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

These first two photos are comparisons of my left and right hand and forearms. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of the back (dorsum) of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of palmar side of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here the constriction of joints and decreased flexibility can be seen in the left hand. (see Mod note) Another test of flexibility of the hand joints is to try to touch your thumb to your pinky finger and make the Boyscout sign. Remember that if you already have joint stiffness due to arthritis or medications you may not be able to do this. Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different. Learn what is a change for your own body, pay close attention to the characteristics and location of any swelling.

      "Content": "Sep 29, 2011 08:55AM LindaLou53 wrote: Hi Kay, I'm so glad you are getting early detection and treatment for your swelling!  To answer your question YES....early Lymphedema often presents with transitory swelling that can reduce on its own. It is still VERY important to get fully evaluated, educated on treatment and prevention strategies and realize that lifetime monitoring and intervention may be necessary. There are 4 stages to Lymphedema.  The good news is that with early detection and treatment, Stage 0 and Stage 1 patients may not be relegated to a lifetime of wearing compression garments and wrapping.  Recent studies have shown that particularly during the first year of cancer treatments involving surgery, chemo and radiation, Lymphdedma may occur due to the tremendous inflammation our bodies go through during that time.  If treated with MLD, properly fitting garments and prevention strategies during this time, many women may return to normal in both size and sensation once the inflammatory process has resolved. SO YES Kay, please continue to see the LE therapist and learn all the ways you can protect yourself from any further progression and keep everything under good control.  Yes, Lymphedema does flare up for many reasons.  Some patients can have many flares and then return to normal, but keep in mind that every time swelling occurs there is additional damage occuring in the extracellular tissue.  It is best to prevent flares when possible and treat them quickly when they occur in order to halt progression to Stage 2 or worse. If your swelling is resolving on its own with no intervention you are most likely a Stage 1 which means this is the ideal time for starting treatment.  Be sure to check out all the good information on the StepUp/SpeakOut website and also review the article on how to find a qualified lymphedema therapist.  You may want to ask your therapist next week about her specific LE training and approach to treatment.  Sometimes, finding the right therapist is the biggest challenge to getting started on the right treatment path.  Please, let us know how your appointment goes with the therapist. Best Wishes, Linda",

We try to caution all at-risk persons to practice risk reduction measures and not let their guard down as time passes.  Of course, 22 years ago when you had your surgery it is no surprise that you did not get comprehensive information on LE.  There was just so little known then and still today we find too many medical professionals who are not at all up to speed on their LE understanding. I hope your therapy sessions go well and you soon regain better mobility of your fingers and hand.  Sounds like you are on the right track with your therapist, wrapping and garments.  Be sure to check out the rest of our Lymphedema forum here and you will also want to see all the resource information available on the Step-up/Speak-Out website built by LE patients for LE patients.",

It is very important when getting fitted for garments to keep the ends of the garments at the shoulder, wrist and finger tips slightly loose to avoid too much constriction. I do self MLD at home and spend quite a bit of time working on my hand since that is my most problematic area.  I get professional MLD twice a month.  Your best bet is to find a certified LE therapist who has had at least 135 hours of specialized training.  You need a therapist who will take the time to educate and show you the process of self MLD and who will address any questions you may have.  Wearing an improperly fitting sleeve or glove is not a good thing, but not wearing any garments at all is also to be avoided.  I would check around for a new therapist and make sure your garments help make your LE better not worse.  Check out this link for info on finding a qualified therapist: www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin...",

There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis. One other point I want to stress is that everyone's LE is unique in its presentation. My LE will not be exactly like your LE. We may share many common aspects though, so I feel it can be helpful to show visual images of LE. I post these images purely for informational/educational reasons and just as an EXAMPLE of how LE may present. I wanted to emphasize the comparisons beween a LE and NON-LE limb to make you all aware of some of the more subtle changes you should keep an eye out for when trying to detect your own LE. As a quick personal history note, I have had LE for 4 years in my left arm and hand with minimal truncal LE. My right arm is at risk for LE but has not yet shown visible signs. My LE is considered Stage 2 because it does not revert to normal with elevation or garments. I have never had large volume differences between my arms. I do have a fair amount of fibrosis and swelling primarily in my hand which results in diminshed strength, flexibility and fine motor skills of that hand. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all! The photos that LindaLou originally and so graciously shared here are no longer available on the hosting site. Before her passing, she also shared the photos on another site, which we are linking here. For examples of what signs to look for, please click the following link to view LindaLou's original images: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/What_does_lymphedem... These first two photos are comparisons of my left and right hand and forearms. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of the back (dorsum) of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of palmar side of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here the constriction of joints and decreased flexibility can be seen in the left hand. (see Mod note) Another test of flexibility of the hand joints is to try to touch your thumb to your pinky finger and make the Boyscout sign. Remember that if you already have joint stiffness due to arthritis or medications you may not be able to do this. Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different. Learn what is a change for your own body, pay close attention to the characteristics and location of any swelling. Be able to point out these subtle changes to your doctor or therapist so they can determine the best treatment for you. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

      "Content": "Feb 12, 2011 06:23AM - edited Feb 12, 2011 08:14AM by LindaLou53 Marcia I'm so glad you are getting support and referrals from your surgeon. It sounds like the LE clinic you will be going to will also have properly trained staff. What you are describing as therapy for several times a week for 3-4 weeks is typically called the \"Intensive Treatment\" period. This is definitely part of the gold standard of treatment for LE. During this intensive period you should receive a full evaluation of your LE including measurements of both arms, instructions and education on skin care, risk reduction, exercise, how to do self MLD and how to wrap with compression bandages. The reason you will be going several times each week is so your therapist can give you professional MLD and then wrap your hand and arm using short stretch compression bandages. You should be wearing these bandages 24/7 until the next LE appointment. This is the process for reducing any swelling in your arms to the optimum level before having you fitted for garments. This process may vary depending on the severity of your LE and the practice habits of the therapist, but the longer you can stay consistently wrapped during the period of treatment, the more effective it will be for reducing your LE. After the intensive period is completed and you have your newly fitted garments, you will enter what is called the \"Maintenance Phase\". You will be practicing what you have learned about skin care, self-MLD, exercise, wear and care of garments at home, with occasional followup appointments with your therapist for re-evaluation and professional MLD as needed. Many women are distressed at wearing the bulky wraps needed for the intensive, especially when life must go on with their jobs and family responsibilities during that time. Solicit as much help as you can from family and friends to pick up the slack. Depending on the type of work one does it may be necessary to gain the support of your employer and flexibility with scheduling of hours worked during that period. Many of us have gone through this type of intensive and glad we did for the best results in getting our LE under control. Everyone's experience will vary but the goal is to prevent your LE from progressing and hopefully even reverse the current symptoms. Please let us know how your appointment with the LE therapist goes. Sorry you are joining our Swell Club but know you will find lots of help and understanding here. I am so happy to hear that my pictures may have helped you to get early diagnosis and treatment!",

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote: Hi Ladies, I promised I would post after seeing my oncologist for my 6 month checkup.  Today was the day...had to drive through 8 inches of snow to get there but I made it!  My CXR results were fine.  I will get my annual CT scan in July.  Today we drew the usual labs, CBC, Chem Profile, Ca 27:29 tumor markers and a recheck of my Vit D level.  Here were our topics of discussion:  ZOMETA: I asked my oncologist about the Azure trial results as it relates to Zometa infusions.  She also was very disappointed in the results of that study but believes it is too soon to give up on Zometa benefiting other groups besides women who already have bone mets.  She said there is another clinical trial in progress which may shed more light on the specific subgroups that could benefit from prophylactic IV Zometa.  I believe this MAY be the trial she was referring to but don't know for sure.  At least this trial is still active and has plans to test over 5,000 Stage I, II or III women for benefit from the Bisphosphonates.  http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00127205?term=Zometa+comparison+trial&rank=52 She is keeping me scheduled for my July Zometa infusion which will be my 11th dose over the last 5 years.  We will then take another look at the issue in 2012 to determine if I will continue on annual infusions or not.  She believes I do fit the current criteria for the subgroup in the Azure trial which did show benefit ie. post menopausal for more than 5 years before starting Zometa  AROMASIN: We then discussed the issue of my being on Aromasin a full 5 years this April.  She said there really is no study data for maintaining on the AI's longer than 6 years but we are both inclined to continue the Aromasin for this my 6th year.  Her plan is to stop my Aromasin later this year for 30 days and then draw Estradiol blood tests to determine how much estrogen my body is producing without the AI. If I am maintaining sufficiently low estrogen levels without the AI then we will trial staying off it,  I have adjusted to living with the joint inflammation and thinning hair side effects of the AI but my onc has concerns about the increased risk of cardiac issues particularly in patients who may already have an at risk cardiac profile. I do not have a hx of cardiac risk so it is not that great a concern for me, but if my body's natural production of estrogen stays sufficiently low enough without the drugs...then it make sense to limit other risks where I can.  I'm sure we will have more discussions on this issue throughout the year.  VITAMIN D: Pending my Vit D blood results from today I will stay on prescription Vit D until my levels reach at least 35.  My results last summer were 18.  KRILL OIL: My oncologist feels that fish oil should be a regular part of my diet particularly to benefit the cardiac system.  She said there is a new form of Fish Oil available now which is derived from \"Krill\" (think mini shrimp) which may provide more benefit than regular fish oils and allows for much smaller sized capsules in its formulation.  I have just double-checked online and see it is available at Walgreens and a variety of health food stores.  Will pick some up after our snow storm is over.  ANTI-INFLAMMATION DIET: I will have to do some research on this and find out what foods are considered \"anti-inflammatory\"  but my onc says that more studies are showing that systemic inflammation can play a role in cancer and numerous other health issues.  We know that inflammation can adversely affect lymphedema and my onc says our immune systems in general are made less effective by the presence of inflammation.   MAINTAINING A HEALTHY WEIGHT: I successfully lost 40 lbs in 2010 and my onc is very happy with that for the benefit a nornal weight provides. I need to work this year on losing another 10 lbs but more importantly getting into an exercise routine which is going to strengthen my cardiovascular and tone up my musculoskeletal systems. She is concerned about my chronic fast resting heart rate which is most likely due to deconditioning and lack of regular exercise.  So I have my work cut out for me this year trying to get into an exercise routine. STATISTICAL RISK OF RECURRENCE: I did want to bring up the topic of my recurrence risk since I passed my 5 year mark last December but am aware that the risk never goes away completely. I am also aware that Invasive Lobular Cancer has an increased risk of later recurrence ie. between years 5-10 than for instance Invasive Ductal Cancer.  IDC statistically recurs sooner than ILC.  This is believed to be due to the different growth rates of the cancer types. I am not the best with statistics but if I understand correctly what my onc told me, a 5 year NED survivor of ILC will have a 2% risk of recurrence for each year between 5-10 whereas a 5 year NED survivor of IDC will have a 1% risk of recurrence for each year between 5-10.  After 10 years NED the recurrence risk drops even further.....but never completely goes away. So...that is the summary of my 15 min oncology visit.  I LOVE my onc and believe she is one of the brightest in the field.  Hopefully, this information will help others in similar discussions with their oncs for future treatment plans.

I never wear rings anymore mostly because none of them fit loose enough.

Thanks for the tip on the Tumeric pills! I will have to check them out. I don't have any huge weight loss tips other than what worked for me. I found a free App for my iPad called \"Lose It\" which is terrific way to keep track of my food intake, set weight loss goals, log daily exercise and food calories. It really helped me to make better food choices and cut back on the sweets and high carb foods. Plus, I started making big batches of homemade vegetable soup every week or so, and substituted one meal a day for a big bowl of soup with crusty toasted bread. It filled me up, was more healthy and very low calorie for a complete meal. I tried eating more fish, less fried foods, never drink sodas...only water or tea etc. The hardest for me was cutting way back on my chocolate and baked goods. I love to cook but decided to curtail the desserts and stick with more healthy snacks ie. Raw veggies and nuts. I did still get my chocolate fix every day with little \"mini-sized\" candy bars but made sure I didn't eat the whole bag in one sitting! :)",

RegulJ in the case of swelling from LE or infiltrated IVs, a diuretic would not be the recommended treatment.  Diuretics can be highly effective in patients with cardiac insufficiency who develop edema but the type of high protein edema seen in LE is actually worsened by using diuretics.  A systemic diuretic would also have little impact on localized tissue swelling from an IV infiltration. Drinking lots of water and keeping the arm warm prior to IV starts is definitely good advice.  Elevating the arm that is feeling heavy and achey is also highly recommended.  Using the smallest gauge needle possible or even a butterfly needle for IV starts is less traumatic to the surrounding tissue.  Making sure the nurses do NOT leave the tourniquet tied around your arm for any length of time, do not allow \"digging\" around to find the vein, if they can't see or feel it they should not go in for a blind exploration.  Always make sure good sterile technique is used for starting the IV.  Carry your own triple antibiotic ointment with you and when the IV is removed have the nurse apply to the IV site before putting on the bandaid. Ferretmom you really need to be evaluated by a qualified LE therapist to do baseline measurements of your arms and determine if you may already have early onset LE.  As to why you are having so many infiltrations I can't say for sure of course.  It could be your veins have just become more fragile from the chemo and with over use.  If you are confident in the expert IV technique of the nurses then your body is trying to tell you that it is not tolerating the repeated sticks at least in your left arm. I am well aware of the risks of using an at risk arm and if I was having repeated infiltrations, multiple sticks, a sense of heaviness and aches in the \"good\" arm I would definitely stop using it and go to either feet, neck or a port. (there is no \"good\" arm in this situation) Please discuss these concerns with your oncologist prior to your next infusion and come to an agreement as to the best method for delivering your treatments without increasing your risk of LE.  Ask your onc for a referral to a qualified LE therapist for evaluation and baseline measurements. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin...

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote: I promised Binney I would try to post a pictoral/tutorial on how I use Kinesio Tape (KT) for my Stage 2 fibrotic LE hand.  I want to preface this tutorial with a couple of caveats. 1.   Do not attempt to self-apply KT if you have not yet been evaluated by a certified lymphedema  therapist as to the appropriateness of KT for your type LE and skin condition. 2.   Do not attempt to self-apply KT until you have been professionally taped by a certified lymphedema therapist to determine its effectiveness in your type of LE and you have received proper training and supervision in the application of KT. I have been self-applying KT for over 2 years now, but I was previously taped and instructed by my CLT therapist for many months in addition to attending KT lectures by Ruth Coopee and have assisted my therapist in KT instructional presentations to other LE therapists.  I am not going to go into great depth here on how KT works to reduce LE swelling or all the application details because you can read the excellent article by Ruth Coopee on the Stepup-Speakout website here: www.stepup-speakout.org/kinsio...  KINESIO TAPING A LE HAND Supplies Needed: You will need a roll of KT and a pair of scissors for cutting the tape. Kinesio Tape currently comes in 4 colors - Black, Blue, Pink and Beige.  It is available in standard and water resistant.  It is also available in 2inch or 3inch widths. The roll on the far left in the picture above is the original KT packaging that was used up til Spring 2008. New packaging was introduced in early 2008 with the name Kinesio Tex GOLD which has the same adhesive wave pattern as the original KT and is the KT that should be used for LE taping. (see the 3 rolls of KT GOLD in the picture above) If you see KT sold as Kinesio Tex PLATINUM you should avoid using that tape for LE because the straight line wave pattern of the adhesive is not as effective and may cause more skin damage. In addition to the tape you will need a good pair of scissors.  Try to find a pair of teflon coated scissors which will cut the KT without the tape sticking to and gumming up the scissor blades.  You can find teflon coated scissors at most craft stores. The KT has a paper backing which is marked by lines to help you determine the lengths you need to cut.  See picture below for an example of the standard paper backing: The length of each section between the vertical lines is 2 inches.  You will learn with practice how many sections of tape you need to cover different body parts. The picture below shows the classic wave pattern of the adhesive of KT GOLD.  Make sure the tape you use has this type of pattern and not the straight line pattern of the Platinum version of KT. Cutting the Tape: When I tape my LE hand I cut 2 different shapes in the tape.  The first shape is called a \"Buttonhole Cut\".  The purpose of the buttonholes is to have holes you can insert your fingers into and then apply the tape to both the dorsal and palmar sides of your hand. To make a buttonhole cut I start out by cutting a length of KT about 5 sections long.  I then fold the tape in half. I then use the scissors to round the cut ends of the tape. (Rounded edges are less likely than a square cut edge to pull loose when pulling sleeves and gloves over top the tape)  After rounding the cut ends, I cut diagonal cuts in the folded end as shown in the picture below.  When you open out the tape after cutting it should look similar to the picture below.    I generally cut 2 identical buttonhole strips since I prefer to fully cover the dorsum and palmar surfaces of my hand with KT.  If you choose to use just one strip of KT on your hand you should insert the 2 side by side  fingers that most need reduction of swelling into the buttonholes. Applying the Kinesio Tape: I insert my little finger and ring finger into the first strip holes.  I work the tape down both fingers until I can apply the body of the tape to my palm and back of my hand.  When applying the tape I hyperextend or flex my wrist so that the tape is applied over my stretched hand. Again please refer to Ruth Coopee's instructions on the amount of stretch to apply to the tape and how to leave no stretch on the ends of the tape.  www.stepup-speakout.org/kinsio... Picture of first strip of tape on the dorsum surface of hand:  Picture of first strip of tape on the palmar surface of hand: I then apply the second strip of tape to my middle and index fingers in the same manner:   After applying the buttonhole strips I then cut a \"Fan Cut\" strip which I use to apply to my fingers.  I usually cut a length of tape about 3-4 sections long, but this should be adjusted for individual hand length and how much of your fingers you want to cover. I round the corners on one edge of the tape and then I cut the other end of the tape into 4 equal sections about 2 thirds of the way down to the rounded end. I shorten the one section that will cover my little finger and I then round each of the ends of the 4 sections.  This is what the fan cut would look like:  I apply the fan cut strip of KT by placing the lower rounded edge near my wrist on top of the KT already applied to the back of my hand. I then slightly stretch each of the cut sections to apply to each of my fingers again with a slight stretch while I flex my fingers. The finished KT application which covers the dorsum, palmar surfaces and all 4 fingers should look something like this:  The KT should never be worn as a substitute for your compression glove and sleeve, but rather is worn underneath your glove and sleeve.  The tape can remain in place for 4-5 days before it should be removed.  I prefer to use the water resistant KT because it withstands showering and getting wet better than the standard KT. The next picture shows me wearing the KT underneath a Juzo Dream Sleeve and Gauntlet in navy color.  I do not generally wear a gauntlet because I need the full compression of a fingered glove, but I wanted to show the KT underneath the garments.  I have found that KT on my hand along with my compression glove helps to reduce swelling and fibrosis even more than just wearing my glove alone.

I generally repeat this process 2-3 times the first day as long as I still note any remaining redness or discomfort.  The key is to determine if the redness is worsening or spreading.  If you have any increasing heat in the area and visual spreading of the redness then you definitely need to treat it as an emergency and get started on antibiotics. The fact that your thumb and webbing may be a bit more swollen is likely due to the inflammation of the original injury.  As long as those areas are not also becoming painful or reddened I would continue to monitor them. Keep your arm elevated, drink lots of water, stay OUT of the lake and be tuned to your body for any subtle changes.  If you are clearly able to see the degree of redness you now have you might want to try lightly marking the margins with a pen so you can be sure whether the redness is resolving or spreading further.  That may be hard to do in a small area like the thumb, if so just observe the anatomical landmarks near the redness now. Don't let this ruin your holiday, but do be aware and closely keep track of your symptoms.  In most cases this type of temporary inflammation will resolve on its own.  If this is the start of a more serious cellulitic infection you will see the symptoms getting worse fairly quickly and should seek medical attention with haste, especially if you are a distance away from medical services.   If the redness resolves and you have no further signs of discomfort or unusual swelling, you can feel safe to wear your compression garments again.  Make sure you protect your exposed arm from sunburn and insect bites during the period you are monitoring it if you are in an outdoor area. Let us know how it goes for you.  ",

LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted. Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however, that could be detected by specialized tools such as perometry or Bio Impedence units. This is why it is so important for women at risk for LE to be aware of these early warning signs and get evaluation as soon as possible by a certified LE therapist. Please do not wait for swelling to be visible before being evaluated if you are already having concerns with discomfort, a sense of heaviness, fullness or achyness. Once we have visible signs of swelling it may be easier to convince the physicians and other medical professionals that we have LE but even then our unique symptoms may be attributed to other potential medical conditions. There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis.

As a quick personal history note, I have had LE for 4 years in my left arm and hand with minimal truncal LE. My right arm is at risk for LE but has not yet shown visible signs. My LE is considered Stage 2 because it does not revert to normal with elevation or garments. I have never had large volume differences between my arms. I do have a fair amount of fibrosis and swelling primarily in my hand which results in diminshed strength, flexibility and fine motor skills of that hand. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

For examples of what signs to look for, please click the following link to view LindaLou's original images: http://www.stepup-speakout.org/What_does_lymphedem... These first two photos are comparisons of my left and right hand and forearms. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of the back (dorsum) of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of palmar side of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here the constriction of joints and decreased flexibility can be seen in the left hand. (see Mod note) Another test of flexibility of the hand joints is to try to touch your thumb to your pinky finger and make the Boyscout sign. Remember that if you already have joint stiffness due to arthritis or medications you may not be able to do this. Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different. Learn what is a change for your own body, pay close attention to the characteristics and location of any swelling. Be able to point out these subtle changes to your doctor or therapist so they can determine the best treatment for you. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

      "Content": "Feb 2, 2011 08:57AM - edited Feb 2, 2011 08:59AM by LindaLou53 lago - as Binney stated we all have different experiences related to our physicians.  I am fortunate that both my breast surgeon and my oncologist are very open to learning about LE and have always been willing to write whatever referrals I need. ANY physician can make a referral to a LE therapist.  Just because we may feel our LE was caused by the surgeon does not mean we cannot go elsewhere for a referral.  As Binney indicated, it is sometimes more difficult to find a surgeon willing to admit they played a role in the development of LE and thus are often less likely to refer patients for treatment.  Remember that once diagnosed with LE you will most likely have a lifelong need for a physician to order garments and refer you for regular evaluations and treatments.  It is important that we find a physician we can communicate openly with and feel they will be responsive to our needs over many years.   The physicians specialty does not matter since they are not the ones who will treat our lymphedema.  All we need is an understanding physician who will write our scripts for garments and treatments that will be provided by qualified LE professionals.  In the case of a patient planning reconstruction, one would hope that their PS is also open to discussing the potential risks and complications of LE as it relates to additional surgeries.  In the best scenario the PS will carefully follow their patients with LE and have no qualms about having them also followed by a LE therapist during their reconstruction process.  IF the PS is not open to doing that, there is no reason the patient can not still be referred by another physician to have their LE monitored and treated as necessary during the reconstruction process. I just want newly diagnosed patients to know that they do not have to be limited in which physician they choose to ask for a referral for their LE evaluations.  Hopefully, one day  ALL physicians will be willing to involve themselves in this aspect of their patient's care.",

I know this is not a condition any of us wants to have and you have every right to feel angry, sad and overwhelmed.  With time, education and proper treatment you will learn to adjust to the necessary lifestyle changes for good LE maintenance.  Catching it early as you did is SO IMPORTANT!  I think you have already taken charge and are headed down the right path to keeping LE under good control.  That is a huge first step!  You are already learning that having LE requires you to be PERSISTENT with your medical providers about what your body is telling you and what you know to be true from the many respected LE resources such as the NLN (be sure to check out the NLN Position Papers on the far right side of the website homepage) Finding the right certified LE therapist is also key to being successful at managing your LE.  Hopefully your current therapist is well experienced and up to date with her training.  Be sure to check out the link above for finding a qualified therapist just so you know what criteria you should be aware of. It makes me very happy if my photos play a role in anyone getting early detection and treatment! Best Wishes to you and your continued good health.    Linda",

These first two photos are comparisons of my left and right hand and forearms. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of the back (dorsum) of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here is a comparison of palmar side of both hands when making a fist. (see Mod note) Here the constriction of joints and decreased flexibility can be seen in the left hand. (see Mod note) Another test of flexibility of the hand joints is to try to touch your thumb to your pinky finger and make the Boyscout sign. Remember that if you already have joint stiffness due to arthritis or medications you may not be able to do this. Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different. Learn what is a change for your own body, pay close attention to the characteristics and location of any swelling. Be able to point out these subtle changes to your doctor or therapist so they can determine the best treatment for you. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

I do believe the L-Dex may have a use in certain cases especially when trying to track extracellular fluid changes post-surgery as compared to pre-surgery baselines.  I had L-Dex readings a few years ago which showed a +13 on my affected left arm compared to my right.  Of course at that point I was well aware I already had LE, just curious what the reading would be.  I would like to see the tool further developed and researched but as it is now, it just adds another piece of the puzzle to the whole picture of LE diagnosis.",

The images I posted above of hand bandaging using multilayers of wraps, pads and foam is best done by a certified lymphedema therapist initially until the right combination of components that works for you is found.  It was this type of intensive wrapping of my hand that caused me to create a cotton glove with velcro for holding foam finger and hand pieces in place so that I could more easily do the wrapping myself at home.  You can check out the very bottom of the wrapping/bandaging page on the StepUp-SpeakOut website to see more details. www.stepup-speakout.org/wrappi...

Because I am blessed with good insurance I get two pairs of sleeves and gloves every 6 months to make sure I have properly fitting garments.  I get professional MLD twice a month and still do my at home version of MLD daily.  I added the low level laser into the mix 2 years ago and continue to use that today.  Even though my LE progress has been gradual, I am very pleased with the fact that now even 4 years later it continues to improve. Will my hand and arm ever be \"normal\" and not need to be maintained with garments and daily MLD? I seriously doubt it.  But I am still ok with that as long as I know the time and committment I spend is keeping me infection free and improving my functionality.  Does it get tiring and frustrating at times?  Yes, of course it does.  I still can't golf or crochet like I used to...but with the ongoing improvements I am getting closer to the real possibility of resuming those activities again.  I know how difficult it is initially when facing a LE diagnosis to imagine your life adapting to the demands of daily maintenance.  It is still a struggle at times for me even now.  But honestly, I have found that dealing with my LE has become just another one of the daily rituals I have to do.  Whether it is pulling on panty hose or pulling on my compression sleeve, washing shirts or washing garments and bandages, exercising to lose weight or to improve my flexibility and lymph flow, it has all become just a part of my life now. So my LE journey continues as does my BC journey and life in general.  I tend to be a practical minded person so I gave up being angry a long time ago.  Life presents challenges no matter who we are.  We just deal with the challenges the best way we can and try to remember all the good things that we still have to be thankful for.  Sorry Lexi for such a LONG answer to your quick question!  But the reality is I continue to do all the basics for maintaining and continuing to improve my LE.  Not everyone will have to do what I do, some may do a lot more and others less depending on the severity of their LE.  ",

      "Content": "Jun 7, 2010 12:07PM - edited Jun 7, 2010 12:10PM by LindaLou53 Hi Hopeful, Sorry I just now saw your post and see you have had no responses.  I know you are probably at the BS office now so hopefully you will get some answers and relief.  Based on what your recent history is with only 2 weeks out from BMX, Recon and having had drains removed on Friday, I would suspect the extra swelling you are having may be related to post-surgical drainage. Sometimes drains are removed a little too early or our body keeps producing more fluid after the drains are removed and this can cause swelling and discomfort.  If you have a seroma which is a pocket of fluid that can often develop, you can have that drained by your BS.  This whole period of normal inflammation immediately following surgery can definitely put an extra burden on our lymphatic systems.  For some women that extra burden is just enough to push them into early onset LE. Yes it is possible to have LE under the arm and in the chest/truncal/breast area also in addtion to the arm and hand. Let us know what your BS told you today.  I would hope that what you are feeling is normal since you are still early in the post-op process, but I would still suggest that when convenient you locate a trained LE therapist who can also evaluate the status of both your arms and truncal area now.   http://www.stepup-speakout.org/Finding_a_Qualified_Lymphedema_Therapist.htm As you progress through your healing, if you have persistent areas of swelling that may be more than normal post-op inflammation you definitely should be formally evaluated for LE. If what you are experiencing now is acutely painful and disabling, you need to seek urgent attention from your BS, PS or an ER.  Please be aware that any areas of your body that feel hot to touch, painful, red in color and spreading in size, are to be considered a medical emergency. We will be looking for an update from you.  Best wishes.",

I have had routine dental cleanings every 6 months in addition to fillings and crowns replaced without requiring prophylactic antibiotics.  Of more personal concern to me is that I have been on IV Zometa for over 4 years which carries a low risk of degenerative bone disease of the jaw following dental procedures....totally unrelated to lymphedema by the way. Discuss your concerns with your dentist before your next cleaning. Best wishes!",

You should be allowed to choose your therapist based on their qualifications.  My oncologist has always been the one to write my referrals and order my sleeves.  She is very interested in the progress I am making with my LE.  All physicians are different, so you should talk with the one you feel most comfortable discussing your concerns with.  If you do not get a referral from one physician, go to the next until you do.  Be persistant and insistant.  This is not a request but a demand that any knowledgeable physician who cares about your health will oblige you with. It is not necessary that you wait until your next office appointment to ask for a referral.  Call whichever physician you think will be most open and ask her staff over the phone.  Be sure to indicate exactly the symptoms you have described here of puffiness and lack of visibility of veins in the affected arm.",

I would find it very difficult to attribute your tingling and coldness symptoms to early stage LE without measurable swelling and absent feelings of achyness or heaviness,  If this tingling and coldness continues or gets worse you should schedule a visit with your oncologist, surgeon, primary MD, neurologist or orthopedist for an indepth evaluation.  A pinched nerve in your neck or arm or wrist could cause these symptoms as could some type of obstruction or growth.  If you are taking any kind of Aromatase Inhibitor like Aromasin, Arimidex or Femara, carpal tunnel syndrome is a common side effect but that usually also causes pain in addition to tingling and coldness. I would not let these symptoms go undiagnosed if they continue to occur on a regular basis.  The physical therapist's suggestion of a splint (I am not familiar with the term wrist cockup) might be helpful but I feel that is just taking a stab in the dark without any real clinical evidence to know what the source of your nerve compression might be. I feel you should have proper diagnostic testing to know for sure what is causing the symptoms. Try to pay attention to how you sleep at night.  You might want to try propping your right arm up on pillows or making sure you do not roll over and lay on your right side if possible.  If the tingling and coldness stop it could be that you were sleeping in an awkward position before...but I would get it checked out either way if the symptoms persist. Regarding your right breast \"fluid filled\"  cavity...you have a seroma which is common after lumpectomy....but can lead to breast lymphedema if not managed properly.  If your right breast has become \"hardened\" you very well may want to see a lymphedema therapist to determine if your breast hardness is lymphedema versus seroma now 1.5 years out from your surgery. A LE evaluation would be a good thing in general so she could evaluate both your arm and breast and get baseline measurements at the same time for future reference. Hope you get an answer soon and proper treatment for these symptoms if they persist.  You know your body better than anybody and this is a change that needs an explanation.  Let us know what you find out.",

LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted. Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however, that could be detected by specialized tools such as perometry or Bio Impedence units.

Please do not wait for swelling to be visible before being evaluated if you are already having concerns with discomfort, a sense of heaviness, fullness or achyness. Once we have visible signs of swelling it may be easier to convince the physicians and other medical professionals that we have LE but even then our unique symptoms may be attributed to other potential medical conditions. There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis.

Typically in LE there will be a noticeable difference in range of motion between the LE and Non-LE hand. (see Mod note) Another subtle sign of hand LE is to check the side profile of your hands. Compare the thickness from the back of the hand (Dorsum) to the palm. Try pinching the skin in the webspace between your thumb and index finger and compare thickness. (see Mod note) Bony prominences may not be as easily seen or felt when LE swelling is present. Check your elbows by feeling all around the bony margins when your arm is flexed to see if the edges are well defined or do they seem soft or puffy. Compare your upper arms for more fullness on the LE side or less muscle definition. (see Mod note) Here is an example of Pitting Edema. (see Mod note) This final photo is a comparison of my left hand in 2006 to my left hand today in 2010. There have been improvements in reduction of swelling in the fingers particularly at the base of the fingers. The dorsum and palm are still congested, but there has been gradual reduction in size and fibrosis, along with improved flexibility and more mobile skin across the knuckles. In 2006 I was not able to touch my thumb to the tip of my middle finger. Today I can just touch my thumb to the tip of my pinky. (see Mod note) I hope these images have been helpful and can point out areas to check for early signs of LE swelling. Remember that some women have LE of the arm but not the hand, or LE of the breast/truncal area only. Everyone is different.

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote: Hi Ladies, I have been wanting to post a pictorial of visible signs of LE for some time now. I finally took some time yesterday to take comparison photos of my LE and NON-LE hand and arm. It was no easy task to position one arm while holding the camera with the other but I hope some of you will find these helpful. Just a few comments up front to be clear. LE can be present long before there are any visible or measurable changes noted. Early stage 0 LE may appear only as a sense of heaviness or achyness in the limb without any visible signs of swelling. There are still tissue changes occuring in the interstitial spaces of the limb, however, that could be detected by specialized tools such as perometry or Bio Impedence units. This is why it is so important for women at risk for LE to be aware of these early warning signs and get evaluation as soon as possible by a certified LE therapist. Please do not wait for swelling to be visible before being evaluated if you are already having concerns with discomfort, a sense of heaviness, fullness or achyness. Once we have visible signs of swelling it may be easier to convince the physicians and other medical professionals that we have LE but even then our unique symptoms may be attributed to other potential medical conditions. There is something in the medical field called \"differential diagnosis\" which just means they look at all the possible causes for your presenting symptoms and using the process of elimination try to narrow down the actual cause. That is why when presenting for the first time with swelling the doctor may want to rule out other causes of edema like infection, blood clots, vascular insufficiency, congestive heart failure, adverse response to medications etc. Getting the correct diagnosis is important so we should not just \"assume\" we have LE when presenting with symptoms of pain and swelling. Our ability to describe and point out the visual clues of our symptoms, however, will greatly help the physician in coming to the correct diagnosis. One other point I want to stress is that everyone's LE is unique in its presentation. My LE will not be exactly like your LE. We may share many common aspects though, so I feel it can be helpful to show visual images of LE. I post these images purely for informational/educational reasons and just as an EXAMPLE of how LE may present. I wanted to emphasize the comparisons beween a LE and NON-LE limb to make you all aware of some of the more subtle changes you should keep an eye out for when trying to detect your own LE. As a quick personal history note, I have had LE for 4 years in my left arm and hand with minimal truncal LE. My right arm is at risk for LE but has not yet shown visible signs. My LE is considered Stage 2 because it does not revert to normal with elevation or garments. I have never had large volume differences between my arms. I do have a fair amount of fibrosis and swelling primarily in my hand which results in diminshed strength, flexibility and fine motor skills of that hand. MODERATOR NOTE: Hi, all!

My approach to my cancer treatments has always been to be as aggressive as possible as long as it makes reasonable sense to me after discussing with the medical experts and doing my own research.  That does not mean I will feel no anxiety about specific treatment protocols, but it does mean I have made up my mind that the benefits outweigh the potential risks and it is within my comfort zone to make that treatment choice. I can tell you that for me, radiation was by far the easiest of my treatment plans.  Even with 3 fields of treatment, I would be in and out of the radiation room in less than 10 minutes.  Yes, the last couple of weeks I developed reddened, irritated skin with a few blisters, similar to a severe sunburn.  But this was totally tolerable and the good news is that skin rapidly heals once radiation treatments are completed.  The ongoing issues of radiation are continuing inflammation and scar tissue that you cannot see on the surface of your skin, but which occur at deeper levels in the tissues.  Radiation effects can persist for a year or more, but these were not effects that prevented me from feeling better and healthier the further away I got from the completion of all treatments. I do believe there are steps you can take to help you reduce limitations due to radiation damage and also help reduce your risk of getting Lymphedema (LE). Flopsy's recommendation to get a PT eval is an excellent one, but I would make sure it is a PT who has been certified also in treating Lymphedema. It is important that you get baseline measurements of both arms and be educated on specific do's and don'ts that can decrease your risk for LE.  Because radiation treatment causes inflammation in the body, as does chemo, the more you learn of ways to assist your lymphatic system and keep it as strong as possible, the better your chances of avoiding LE. I had LE before I ever started radiation, so my concern was not the fear of getting LE but how to keep it from getting worse.  Knowing what I know now, I definitely see the benefit in seeing a LE therapist throughout radiation treatments so you can keep your lymphatic system supported and in the best shape possible.  My flat chest has completely healed, scars have faded and there is no residual visible damage from radiation.  The first year or so my left chest wall was slightly darker in color...like a light tan, but even that has faded so you cannot tell the difference.  Please make sure you spend some time on the StepUp-SpeakOut website and our Lymphedema forums here to learn of ways to find a qualified Lymphedema Therapist and to reduce the risk of LE. Knowledge is power and when we understand why we make the choices we do, we feel more in control of our life. Let us know how it goes for you.  Linda",

According to your dx in your signature, you had 1/14 nodes.  Are those the results of your recent ALND after you had finished chemo or did you also have nodes removed prior to your recent BMX and ALND? I would review the most recent pathology reports to confirm the actual number of involved nodes and any other indications that they found signs of active disease.  If the breast tissue and axillary nodes removed last week are free of disease I would definitely have a discussion with your medical oncologist and radiation oncologist to find out why they feel radiation is necessary in your case. It used to be years ago, that women who had mastectomy were not also given radiation.  Now it is not uncommon for women to have mastectomy and radiation, but it really should be determined by each individual case and presentation of disease. Make sure you feel comfortable that you have been given all the most current pathology information, and then have discussions with your docs to determine what is the best course for you.  Let us know if you have more info on why they want to do radiation also.

I used the lymphedema risk calculator with my actual facts and it predicted I had a 100% chance of developing LE in 5 years!  I had 6 rounds of chemo in the ipsilateral arm, a full axillary dissection including level III, radiation of the lymph node basin, a seroma in less than 6 months, and arm edema in less than 6 months. (my actual arm swelling occurred  8 weeks after surgery and during my second round of chemo prior to ever getting radiation) Its interesting that if I uncheck the box for arm swelling within the first 6 months my 5 year risk drops from 100% to 64%.  And if I never developed a seroma either, the number drops to 52.  If I further remove the fact that my lymph node basin was radiated and check breast/chest radiation instead, the risk drops to 19% ! I found the 2 biggest contributors that increased risk of LE for me were radiation of the lymph node basin and early arm swelling within the first 6 months.   Guess the cards were stacked against me more than I realized!",

Because my second was Stage IIIC with 23/23 positive nodes I still see my oncologist every 6 months and my breast surgeon every 1 year.  I get blood work including Ca 27:29 tumor marker every 6 months and annual CT scans.  I am a strong believer that \"waiting for symptoms to appear\" is possibly waiting too long in some cases.  I understand the concern about radiation exposure and \"false positive\" results, but I also believe that treating a single small spot of local recurrence is much easier and provides better quality of life, than waiting until treatment options are limited by a widespread or distant recurrence. Everyone has their own approach and comfort zone when it comes to post-cancer treatment monitoring.  I am much less worried about the radiation from an annual scan than I am worried about missing an early recurrence.  The old mantra that \"early detection does not change survival outcomes\" may have been true 30 years ago when Stage IV was considered terminal with less than a year predicted survival, but that is certainly not the situation today. With today's detection and treatment options patients can live many years with advanced cancer as a chronic illness.  My oncologist had me on low dose Xeloda (oral chemo) during my 7 weeks of radiation because it was supposed to make the cancer cells more susceptible to the radiation.  I also started on Aromasin as soon as I finished chemo and prior to starting radiation.  I have been on Aromasin for 7.5 years now and will continue it indefinitely.  I also had 5 years of IV Zometa which ended in 2011.  While I know we can never guarantee that the cancer won't come back, I prefer to feel that I am doing what I can to stay on top of things.  If it comes back anyway, then at least I won't be second guessing or regretting my choices.  Again, this works for me but does not have to work for everyone else.  Each of us must make the choice that we can best live with and still put cancer on the back burner so we can get on with our lives. ",

I too had a lumpectomy and SNB in 2000 on the right breast for a small invasive ductal cancer.  The preliminary path report my surgeon received while I was still on the table was that my nodes were all clear.  She had removed 6 nodes in the SNB procedure.  My onc told me she planned to only do radiation of the breast and no chemo would be needed. One week later we got back the final pathology report which included the Histochemistry...these showed that I had micromets to 2 of the sentinel nodes.  My surgeon also wanted to take me back for a complete axillary dissection.  My onc told me that the presence of any cancer cells in the nodes kicked me into needing chemo.  The plan was to use standard chemo protocol (which back then was AC/Taxol) radiation of the breast plus the lower axilla, and start on Tamoxifen. I chose to not have any additional axillary nodes removed because I had only a very tiny amount of cancer found in the 2 nodes, the other 4 were clear, and now that I would have chemo anyway my treatment plan would be the same whether I had additional nodes removed or not.  I knew there was a risk in making that decision but had my oncs support and felt the risk of LE was greater in my specific situation. As it turns out that cancer was very successfully treated without any recurrence or development of LE in my right arm.  In 2005 however, we found a brand new primary BC, this time Lobular in the opposite breast.  My decision process this time was much different because of the much more advanced pathology.  We knew based on MRI and PET that I definitely had nodal involvement on the left.  A SNB was attempted at the time of my bilateral mastectomy but not surprisingly the surgeon had to do a total axillary clearance including all 3 levels of nodes.  23 nodes were removed, all 23 positive. In this situation I knew the removal of so many cancerous nodes was essential in my goal of successful treatment along with full chemo, radiation and hormonal therapies. I developed LE of the left arm within 2 months of surgery and while taking chemo.  I am very grateful today that my dominant right arm remains non-affected by LE even though I recognize it will always be at risk.  Binney very appropriately points out that the decision making process MUST be focused first on the successful treatment of your cancer.  The type of cancer (ductal vs lobular or other types), the grade, degree of nodal involvement and plan for chemo/radiation and hormonals should all come into play when deciding whether to have further nodes removed. I have had experience now with 2 very different situations and thus 2 different decisions.  I do not regret either of my decisions made in 2000 or 2005.  As much as we all hope to find a \"roadmap\" that will tell us what to do, we must make our decisions based on the best current information provided to us by our professionals and then go with what feels right for us. I wish you the best in your journey!  Please come here often for support.  You will find that many of us have dealt with very similar feelings, fears and anxiety and you never have to feel alone.",

One of the downsides of neo-adjuvant chemo, however, is not knowing the nodal status for staging unless a sentinel node biopsy is done prior to chemo. But certainly the effectiveness of chemo can be measured by the amount of tumor shrinkage. Recent news about Lobular cancer not being as responsive to chemo may support surgery first, however as Linda-L's experience proves, her lobular cancer was very effectively treated by chemo. I would certainly listen to your oncologists recommendations and start looking for a second surgical opinion. ",

Does avoiding any use of an at risk arm take away your risk of ever getting LE in that arm?  Does it reduce your risk by \"X\" percent?  Those are unknown values at this point in time but basic understanding of physiology and logic would be weighted toward avoiding an at risk limb when you can. Taking all that into consideration I have chosen to use my at risk right arm for all IVs, blood draws and wrist BP readings for the last 5 years.  If I need an injection I have it in my thigh or hip.  I do actively control the number of sticks I receive by having my labwork coordinated between physicians and drawn all at the same time with one stick.  I also only have IVs started by someone who is familiar with my arm or who is a known expert at starting IVs.  I make sure I do thorough MLD of both sides or visit my LE Therapist for full MLD 24-48 hours prior to a procedure requiring an IV.   At my recent colonoscopy my IV was started by the Anesthesiologist in my at risk hand but I did request my BP be monitored in my leg since you shouldn't monitor BP in the same arm as an IV and my other arm with active LE was wearing compression garments. I would be more reluctant to use the arm with active LE for needle sticks or IVs just because it is at a known increased risk for a cellulitis infection.  I would suggest that for your colonoscopy procedure you have your BP monitored in one of your legs.  The IV can be started in the opposite leg or in your at risk arm depending on your level of concern. I have found that most hospital staff especially in specialty areas like ER, ICU and outpatient surgery clinics are very tuned into the precautions for LE. One day we will have more solid data on just what activities present what level of risk... at this point we each just decide what our risk tolerance is and what we are comfortable doing. Good luck with whatever you decide and wishing you good results with your testing. As a side note....you mention that your right sided LE is aggravated by wearing your forms.  You might want to check out the recent thread on the lightweight microbead forms available from TLC. www.tlcdirect.org/products/sku... Also be aware that tight bra bands, waist bands and shoulder straps can impede proper flow of the lymph fluid in your trunk and may contribute to your increased symptoms.  I have switched to wearing camisoles or tank tops 100% to avoid the extra compression on my truncal area.",

I am concerned though that you are experiencing some swelling and pain in your at risk arm.  Crochet is a very repetitive motion and could be causing some of the discomfort. Since you are just a month away from surgery, it would be in your best interest to make an appt with a certified lymphedema therapist (CLT) and let her evaluate your arm.  She will do baseline measurements and determine if you have actual volume changes yet.  We often first become aware of early LE by the pain, throbbing, sense of heaviness that can be felt in the arm even before actual swelling is noticed. Try sleeping with your arm elevated on a pillow at night and pay attention to any arm changes you note during the day, especially following specific activities.  If you do have early LE, now is the time to address it and keep it from getting any worse if possible.  New studies are indicating that very early LE may in fact be reversible to a degree and some women can avoid wearing compression garments if they get treatment early enough. I have not given up hope on going back to my crochet, but it has taken a backseat on my priority list right now.  I do believe if I put my thinking cap on I can come up with a way to hold the yarn through the fingers of my LE hand and still be able to crochet.  I will however, have to monitor closely for early fatigue and discomfort in that hand.  I sometimes have those problems with typing on the keyboard, so long marathons on the PC or crocheting may not be adviseable.

There is no real reason to wait til after the 6 weeks of radiation that I am aware of.  I started taking Aromasin the day after my last chemo and continued it all through radiation.  My onc also had me take a low dose of daily Xeloda, which is an oral chemotherapy pill, throughout my 6 weeks of radiation because it has been shown to improve the effectiveness of radiation. Having 43 nodes in just the first level of axillary nodes is a large number but if you interpret that in a positive way as meaning that you have an extremely healthy lymphatic system with plentiful nodes all doing their job of trapping stray cancer cells, you might feel better about the situation.  The fact that you had many nodes still not affected by cancer is a very good sign in spite of having 17 nodes positive.  The number of nodes found in each individual person is unique, but I think I would be happier having plentiful nodes all working together to keep my immune system functioning versus having so few nodes that they are quickly overwhelmed by the introduction of cancer cells. You may be able to also hope that because you had so many nodes in the first level, that you still have adequate healthy nodes left to keep your lymphatic fluid flowing properly which may reduce your chances of developing lymphedema. I had all 3 levels of axillary nodes removed but that was only 23 nodes for me.  All 23 were positive for cancer also but I will be celebrating 4 years NED in November. Hang in there Michele...there are many of us positive node survivors doing very well!",

I believe the site that Jinky posted is one from a LE patient's blog from several years ago.  It has good basic instruction but there are many ways to wrap with some \"fine tuning\" of the basics.  If you have never wrapped before or been evaluated by a LE therapist, you should not be attempting this on your own.  Generally, the process is to go to a specially trained LE therapist first, be evaluated, let her take baseline measurements of both arms, let her teach you how to do MLD and wrapping as she also performs these functions for you over a period of several days until you feel comfortable with it.  Depending on the severity and type of LE you have, it may or may not be necessary to use heavy foams or \"chip bags\" in the wrapping process.  Also, wrapping takes some time and patience to get it \"just right\" so that the wraps are not so tight they cutoff your circulation, or so loose that they won''t stay up and are ineffective.  You need to learn how to apply wraps in such a way that they provide firm, graduated pressure without causing pain or numbness.  You can learn this with a therapist's guidance and lots of practice.  Hope this helps!",

I believe your IDC in the left breast would be considered a new primary and not a metastasis from your original DCIS in the right breast.  However, the positive right lymph node may be considered a \"mets\" or recurrence from your original DCIS.  The pathology reports and any further nodal removal on the right will give them more info as to level of involvement on the right side.  Unless cancer cells are found outside the breast and axilla regions it is not considered to be metastatic stage IV. As previously stated by wishiwere, you will most likely be facing discussions about both local (surgery and/or radiation) and systemic (chemo and/or hormonals) treatments. The fact that your PET scan did not show other worrisome hot spots is good and hopefully it is just this one node positive.

When I first started rebounding, it was so much fun I got a little over enthusiastic and felt it in my knees the next couple of days.  I have learned that the gentle method, always keep your feet touching the surface is the best.  Slow, rhythmic \"health bouncing\" as Neat calls it, will cause your skin to move with the force of gravity in a back and forth motion which would certainly stimulate the lymphatics. Because I have arm LE I make a point while bouncing to raise my left (affected) arm above my head as I hold on to the grab bar with my right .  I will alternate arms when one arm starts to tire.  Sometimes I bounce with both arms raised above my head when I am feeling stable.  I just sort of go with how I am feeling at the time.  If I have been out all day shopping, carrying groceries or heavy bags and my arm starts to feel a little \"full\" or achy, I will bounce for 3-5 minutes while watching TV.  I also like to bounce first thing in the morning when I have time to  \"jump start\" the lymphatics early in the day. It will be interesting if one day a real clinical study is done on the benefits of rebounding.  But for now, I think as long as one uses good judgement by not overdoing it, or jumping too vigorously, (especially if you have known joint problems), it is unlikely it will do any harm and in fact I believe more likely it will do actual good. Be aware that alot of rebounders are sold with accompanying \"exercise dvds\" or specific exercise programs.  Keep in mind that these programs are not at all geared for the best benefit of lymphedema patients.  Most of the exercises are for losing weight, gaining muscle strength and coordination etc.  If you attempt to follow those programs you may find them much more difficult to do and problematic for your LE.  I watched my dvd program just once and decided I needed to be 20 years younger and without LE to participate at that level!  Stick with the short periods of gentle bouncing.... not jumping... to get the best benefit. Just go slow at first if you are new to rebounding.  See how you feel the next day and gradually work up to at least a few minutes everyday.",

      "Content": "Mar 31, 2012 06:24PM - edited Mar 31, 2012 07:18PM by LindaLou53 Thank you everyone for the good thoughts, kind comments and condolences.  I'm really doing ok with this new onset.  While I had hoped it would not happen, I knew my risks were relatively high.  My primary goal now is to keep it at a latent Stage 0/1 and avoid any progression to Stage 2 fibrosis if at all possible! I am hopeful that by getting early treatment and wearing daytime compression for the next several months I may have the option of going without daily garments on the right from time to time. Binney you are right, I WAS very glad I had hold of my husband's belt! Kira being compared with Jane Armer is QUITE the compliment!  Don't think I deserve it but thank you anyway!  Kcshreve, actually I'm the one who made the informed decision to use my at risk right arm for IVs, blood draws and wrist BPs after receiving my left breast cancer dx in 2005.  The fact is I still do not believe my current new onset of LE is the result of those specific activities.  It is very clear to me that in spite of having those procedures done on my right arm every 4-6 months, under very specific guidelines (which I can elaborate on in a different post), my ongoing perometry and circumferential measurements steadily improved over the last 4 years.  It had been more than 5 months since my last IV, blood draw, BP prior to this new onset LE.  There is no question in my mind that the sudden, sustained strain of trying to bear an extreme weight was the causative factor in this instance. Thus my discussion recently with Jane Armer over the lack of a definitive cause and effect relationship between IVs, blood draws and LE. While I believe there IS some risk, I believe it to be a small one due more to poor technique than anything else.  I DO, however, feel the risk of precipitating LE is much higher when placing a full cuff BP on the at risk arm and applying sustained strong compression, than having a sterile needle stick. Tina337 I have always been more cautious when it comes to BP and will not allow a full size cuff on my right upper arm, but I do still utilize my wrist BP device and have no plans at this point to stop using it when needed for routine office visits. I will opt for leg BP as I did during my colonoscopy anytime a wrist cuff is not allowed or possible pending the specific procedure. This is still very much a process of navigating the dark waters as I go, hoping I can keep my head above water until the rescue boat arrives!",

Around the first of this year there was a manufacturing change in Kinesio Tape in which they changed the patterning and type of adhesive used on the back side of the tape. Apparently this was a result of patent negotiations and in the interim the manufacturer had to use a different adhesive process. So the new KT unfortunately was found to have two problems. It was not as effective in moving lymph fluid because it lacked the original \"wave\" pattern on the adhesive side. Even worse, when following the standard application process of using a slight stretch when applying the tape, patients were reporting skin tears, blisters and general skin irritation due to the new adhesive. The good news is that the patent issues got resolved and the original wave pattern adhesive is again being produced. You have to look carefully for the product name however. The \"new\" original Kinesio Tape which is best suited for LE now goes under the name of KINESIO GOLD. They are also still making the interim version with the stronger adhesive and less effective pattern for LE... it is now called KINESIO PLATINUM. So this is just a heads up if you use KT as much as I do to help control your LE, make sure that you order the Kinesio GOLD to get the original design.",

Here is a link to Artiflex on the BandagesPlus website.  It comes in handy for building up the wrist area and protecting the antecubital fossa from irritation by the bandages. www.bandagesplus.com/prd/68/69...

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote: On December 15, 2011 my right arm which has been at risk for 12 years, swelled for the first time.  It had been over 5 months since I had an IV, blood draw or Wrist BP taken in that at risk arm.  I had not flown in 2 years.  I had no cuts, burns, infections or known injury to my arm.  In the 6.5 years since my left breast cancer and LE dx of the left arm, I had gradually worked my way back to normal activity following completion of treatments, which included surgery, chemo, radiation and ongoing hormonal medications. My pre and post cancer lifestyle has always been an active and physically demanding one.  My husband of 40 years became paraplegic at the age of 5 as a result of Poliomyelitis in 1952.  I am 6ft tall, athletic and accustomed to doing all my own heavy lifting, home maintenance and repairs as needed that might otherwise have been the domain of an able bodied husband.  I am an independent minded person, some might say stubborn, but prefer to find a new and safe way to do whatever needs being done whenever possible.   I do know when to give up and let someone else take over, however, when I feel the risk is too high. I know the events that I believe precipitated the first swelling episode of my right arm.  My husband has been suffering from Post-Polio syndrome for the last 15 years or longer.  This is a progressive weakening of his upper body muscles after a lifetime of overcompensation for the paralysis of his legs.  My husband has been very independent his whole life, achieving goals most said he could never achieve.  He has never needed assistance for any activities of daily living until recently.   This past December he was scheduled for a routine colonoscopy and the frequent trips to the bathroom during the prep process took their toll on his strength.  He required assistance in his transfers to and from the bed and the bathroom several times the day prior to the exam.  The day of the exam I drove the car and he rode in the passenger side, which was foreign to him and his usual transfer process.  He managed to transfer into the car with my help. Following the colonoscopy procedure he was monitored for over 3 hours before we were released to return home.  Still a little groggy and under the effects of pain meds, my husband was wheeled out by the nurse as she accompanied us to the car.   After 40 years of knowing exactly when to assist and how to assist my husband, he prefers not to accept help from well-meaning but less adept strangers when I am available. What he and I did not account for however, was the extent of his drug induced weakness and the reversal of his usual transfer procedure by entering the passenger side of the car.  In mid transfer, he lost his balance and fell forward.  I fortunately already had a hold of his belt from behind him, however I was now bearing a good portion of his weight (195lbs) as I hung on to him. The nurse ran to the driver\u2019s side of the car, crawled through and helped pull my husband in to safety as I continued to hold him.  I know it was only a matter of seconds but it was an extreme sustained strain on my arms. Honestly, during the moment of the crisis I was more concerned about injuring my back, LE truly did not even cross my mind.  That night however, I awakened at 3am to find my right hand and forearm visibly swollen for the first time.  I stayed up til 5am, doing self MLD, deep breathing, drinking water and donning my off the shelf sleeve and gauntlet usually reserved for flying. By morning I was relieved to see that my arm and hand had returned to \u201cnormal\u201d.  For a moment I hoped it had just been a bad dream, but the feelings of heaviness with aches and general muscle fatigue would not let me stay in denial for long.  My husband felt terrible and responsible, but I told him the risk has always been there\u2026.it could have easily been another incident of  atypical strain on my arms. One week later, 3 days before Christmas, I went in for my initial LE evaluation and the start of twice a week treatments for 2 months.  My LE was determined to be Stage 0 symptoms alternating with early Stage 1 measureable changes.  I did not go through a typical intensive treatment with daily 24/7 short stretch bandage wrapping.  There was concern from both my therapists that aggressive compression at this stage would be detrimental.   During the 2 months of therapy I received MLD and trigger point massage with weekly measurements.  I obtained new off the shelf Class 1 Juzo sleeves and stubbed finger gloves, which I wear during the daytime.  I currently do not wear a nighttime garment on the right.  My arm has responded very well with reduction of swelling by a maximum of 1.8cm in the upper arm and 1.4cm in the forearm.  Visibly my right arm looks normal, however, certain activities now bring on the sensory changes that keep reminding me of the potential for progression.  During the initial phase of treatment my very dominant right arm would fatigue and get achy much more quickly with activities such as using the curling iron or scrubbing the kitchen stove.  I now have returned to these activities and experience only occasional sensory changes with prolonged, vigorous motion using the right arm. Since I already have Stage 2 LE in the left non-dominant arm, and found out quickly that it is very difficult for my left hand to adequately manage self MLD on the right, I spent 2 months getting the proper documentation and medical certification to have my insurance approve the purchase of the newest Flexitouch system with the upgraded controller and redesigned garments.  Now like Binney, I have bilateral arm, vest and truncal garments for use with the Flexitouch. During the last 4 years, I have been a participant in Jane Armer\u2019s LE study at Columbia, Missouri. I have had both perometry x3 and circumference measurements x3 of my left and right arm at each 6 months visit over those 4 years.  My measurements have shown steady reduction in both the left and right arms over this time period with a slight increase in June 2011 attributed to the summer heat wave and a small weight gain. It just happened that I saw Jane Armer 12 days after my new onset of LE when I went to Columbia, Mo for my final study appointment in December.  I specifically discussed with Jane my longstanding opinion regarding the issues of IVs, Blood Draws and BPs in a limb at risk for LE.  She well understands the dilemma facing patients with bilateral risk or active LE in both limbs.  Unfortunately, as we know, there are no clinical studies to definitively answer the question of degree of risk for these activities.  She agreed with me that while use of legs and feet are an alternate choice, they bear risks of their own when dealing with underlying health conditions, poorly trained staff and specifically in the case of leg BPs, improper equipment and inaccurate results.   The fact is that these questions regarding how best to receive ongoing health care monitoring while reducing our risk of LE are not likely to be answered anytime soon by evidence based medicine.  A standard clinical trial format where some patients would receive the procedures suspected of doing harm would not be ethical and thus I doubt we will be seeing any clinical trials testing the theories about risk.  That does not negate the benefit, however, of anecdotal input from individual patients and therapists who see correlations in the field between certain activities and development of LE.   Better understanding of the physiology and functioning of the lymphatic system,  along with anecdotal experiences of certified therapists and patients are the foundation for the NLN position papers.  There are good reasons to practice these precautions when possible, but I do believe it is important that we understand the limitations of the data.  Certainly, individual health histories, risk tolerance and quality of life issues must come into play when making the decisions of how best to guard against new onset LE. My reasons for posting today were primarily to relay my personal experience with a new onset of LE.  To also remind everyone that our individual pathologies, surgical and radiation treatment histories, personal genetic makeup and physical lifestyles are all factors that play a role in our own degree of LE risk. I am an advocate of the NLN position papers.  I encourage everyone to practice risk precautions whenever they can.  I continue to take many precautions and go to great lengths to limit my exposure to invasive procedures.  Unfortunately, sometimes Life just happens.  If we find ourselves facing a progression or new onset, no matter what the cause, we pick ourselves up and continue on to the best of our ability.   We each must make our own best choices based on the information we have at hand.  We learn from each other and our shared experiences.  We may not always agree, but I believe we do all have each other\u2019s best interests at heart.  That has certainly always been my intent and continues to be. I hope that sharing my experience will be helpful to at least some.

I am in the process of being registered for the Paloma-3 clinical trial and after a repeat CT scan next week, hope to get started on my new treatment protocol by Monday the 14th.  I can't say I am shocked by my progression since I always knew my risk was high for a recurrence.  I had 23/23 positive nodes in 2005 at the time of my Stage IIIC dx with ILC.  I am definitely sad to be facing this again but also feel very grateful to have had 8 good years NED.  I am now trying to get back into battle mode.  I know I will fight where I can, but also want to continue enjoying life as much as possible.   I am looking forward to meeting many of you and benefiting from your experience and insight.  I also look forward to having a place to vent or express those deep emotions that sometimes require a special outlet where they can be truly understood.

      "Content": "Jul 18, 2009 01:28AM - edited Jul 18, 2009 01:33AM by LindaLou53 Ooh wow...where to begin! Dcsige I am sorry you have to join the Swell Club but this is the place to come for information and support concerning LE (lymphedema). My first reaction when I read your post was...my gosh...just diagnosed yesterday and already given a sleeve and gauntlet! Some may think it is a good thing to have \"speedy\" service but in the case of newly diagnosed LE it is NOT! The thing is that you were doing exactly what you should do, you noticed a problem with swelling and you went immediately to get it evaluated and treated. Good for you! Unfortunately, the standard of care for treating newly diagnosed LE is not to send you home with a sleeve and glove after the first visit. Did you see a certified LE therapist? Does your therapist have at least 135 hours of specialized LE training? Did your therapist take measurements of both your arms, did she do MLD (manual lymph drainage) on you, did she teach you how to do self MLD at home, did she explain the full components of CDT (complete decongestive therapy) which involves daily MLD, wrapping the arm for a period of at least 2 weeks with short stretch bandages 24/7 and seeing the therapist a minimum of 3 days a week, preferably 5 days a week during this intensive treatment period? Did she talk about skin care, exercise, precautions against infection? I believe the reason you are having problems with increased hand swelling after receiving the compression garments is because: 1.your garments are not custom fitted or properly fitted for your arm 2. you are wearing a gauntlet (which stops at the first set of knuckles at the base of your fingers) and is never a good idea if you already have hand swelling. 3. your compression sleeve is providing too much pressure at your wrist and there is not enough pressure on your hand from the gauntlet so that the LE fluid is being forced back into your hand, making the swelling worse. What you really need at the very minimum is a properly fitted full hand glove (has full fingers with open tips) that provides the highest gradient pressure distally at your fingertips and then the compression gradient should become slightly less as you move up your arm toward your shoulder. This is what helps to move the LE fluid up to where it needs to drain properly in your body. For now, since your swelling is so much worse wearing your current garments, I would stop wearing the sleeve and gauntlet all together. Keep your arm elevated on pillows at night when you sleep and throughout the day when it is convenient (while watching TV, reading etc) Drink lots of fluids, protect your arm from cuts, bug bites, sunburn etc. Call or make yourself another appointment with the therapist if only to inform her of your worsening swelling with the new garments. Find out exactly what kind of LE training she has had and how much of her practice is working with LE patients. Ask her why you are not being given at least a full 2 week course of intensive CDT with the short stretch bandages prior to being given garments. Ask her why you are not being given ongoing MLD and being taught how to do your own self MLD. (this is not something you learn in one visit with a therapist) If you do not get satisfactory answers, I would ask that you either be refunded for the improperly fitting garments or have them replace the gauntlet with a properly fitting full glove to go along with your compression sleeve. I would then be finding a fully certified LE therapist who will provide the proper standard of care as mentioned above. You deserve to have your LE properly treated from the beginning. You have been proactive and looking out for your own best interests by trying to get treatment as soon as you noticed the swelling. The best thing you can do for yourself and your future success at managing your LE is to find a good, experienced and effective certified LE therapist. I'm sure Binney and others will come along with more advice, but here are some links you should check out for more info on what is involved in treating LE, garments, therapists etc. I think you should read this link first on the StepUp-SpeakOut website which explains exactly what you need to know about finding a qualified LE therapist, questions you should ask and also explains in more detail what the proper standard of care is for a newly diagnosed patient.You can also check out the rest of the SU-SO site while you are there, which has a wealth of information for you. www.stepup-speakout.org/Findin...  Also check out the NLN Website for current research on LE and to read the position papers which give you the latest recommendations for precautions, exercise, air travel and treatment of LE www.lymphnet.org Your LE may seem daunting at first to learn all about the daily maintenance routines and ongoing therapy, but like most things it becomes a way of life fairly quickly.  The journey will be so much easier and productive for you though, if you can get associated with a qualified therapist who takes the time to instruct and support you through the process. Please let us know how it goes for you!  ",

Regarding trying to determine who develops LE after which types of breast surgery, nodes or no nodes removed, what we need is for the cancer centers and oncology surgeons to finally recognize that we MUST start using new early detection measures for all at risk patients.  They should incorporate baseline limb measurements into the standard preop process and then follow up every 3 months with Bio Impedence measurements for at least the first year and document the subjective feedback from patients regarding any sensory changes or discomfort.  If we could start collecting data which showed definitively that interstitial fluid changes occur as a precursor to measurable limb size changes, we would be able to institute LE treatment which could possibly prevent anyone ever having to live with the actual swelling of LE.  There is just not enough emphasis being placed on education, prevention and early detection even though we already have the technology to do so.  Thanks for putting together a pamphlet Moogie.  If you can find a way to save it as a Word Doc or PDF file it could easily be downloaded and printed for anyone wanting to share your information.  There are websites such as YouSendIt  (http://www.yousendit.com/)   to which you can upload your file and then email a web link to anyone you invite to download your pamphlet.  Currently YouSendIt has a free service which limits you to 1 GB of downloads a month and 100 downloads of a single file.",

It sounds like there are no worries about cancer on your PET, but it is a good idea to have the stomach checked out if you have had no previous history of GI issues.  A lot of women experience GI distress including gastritis even several years following chemo treatments. Our GI systems also get a little more sensitive as we get older, so it may just be an early \"heads up\" for you. It is great you are feeling good and no signs of cancer 3 years out!   Linda P.S. I and my onc believe in doing annual CT scans, not PETs because a PET can have a higher incidence of false positives.  Also it is not very accurate at detecting small lesions 1.0 cm in size or smaller.  PET scans are also more expensive than CTs but are still very useful when needing confirmation of suspicious areas if found on CT.  I personally would much rather find something early which typically may not be symptomatic, than wait for symptoms to present themselves.",

One suggestion which may be helpful, is a method you might consider for more objectively monitoring your red spot.  Would it be possible to use a permanent marker to draw around the area you want to observe and have your daughter or yourself not only visually look for changes but take a digital photo each day?  If your skin is too sensitive or the surgical area still healing you may not want to use a marker, but just a daily photo with landmarks might be worthwhile for comparison purposes.  I find the smartphone cameras so very helpful for documenting injuries or subtle changes.  Sometimes our subjective viewing and in my case poor memory recall, is not as accurate as looking at a series of images that can more objectively show changes in size, texture, color etc.  Just a thought. I agree with Binney and Kira that there is no evidence to prove MLD spreads cancer and untreated LE certainly presents problems of its own.  I faced a similar decision just over 2 months ago when I was diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer.  My mets appear to be primarily in the nodes, but widely spread throughout neck, chest and abdomen, so pretty impossible to do MLD without impacting involved nodal areas.  I made the decision along with my therapist to continue my usual professional MLD sessions every 2 weeks and my standard self-MLD routine at home.  I am comfortable with that decision at this point. JO-5, please let us know how things go for you and the results of your next doctors visit!   Prayers and best wishes going out for you!",

My cancer was far from the nodes.\" Yorkiemom, our lymphatic system is very similar to our blood system in that it covers our entire bodies.  We have hundreds of lymph nodes scattered throughout our body and these nodes are all connected by lymphatic structures similar to veins.  The lymphatic vessels contain lymphatic fluid which is carried throughout our body similar to how blood is carried through our veins. The lymphatic fluid is filtered through our lymph nodes and ultimately emptied into our blood stream where it is excreted through our kidneys. No matter the location of a cancer tumor, there is usually a lymphatic or blood vessel near by.   When a cancer becomes invasive it means it can possibly travel through the body by means of the lymphatic system, the blood system or both.  If a pathology report states no evidence of vascular involvement that typically means there was no evidence of the tumor invading a nearby blood vessel.  If cancer is found in a lymph node, it means the cancer found its way into a lymphatic vessel and was then transported to the lymph node for filtering. The job of the nodes is to filter and remove waste products of the body.  A node positive for cancer was doing its job, trying to filter out those cells.  Breast tissue has more lymphatic structures than blood vessels so we most often see breast cancer spread first to the lymph nodes in the breast area. Anytime a cancer growth has become invasive, there is always the risk of cells spreading to other areas of the body. Fortunately, surgery and radiation can help eliminate cancer in the local area of the tumor.  Chemo and hormonal meds are systemic treatments that can kill off cells possibly already circulating throughout the body.  There are no guarantees that our cancer will not spread, but by treating positive nodes both locally and systemically we certainly improve the odds. Below is a photo of the lymph nodes and vessels in the breast/chest area.  This is part of a poster set I own from the ACOLS (Academy of Lymphatic Studies).  I think it helps when we can really visualize the extent of the lymphatic system in our bodies and realize just what a marvelous system it is in keeping our bodies free from toxic waste products as much as it can.  I hope this helps answer the question of how cancer can spread to the lymph nodes. I am over 6 years out from 23/23 positive nodes after my second BC diagnosis. I continue to be grateful for every day that I remain NED. Live for today...this moment...that is all anyone on this earth has for a certainty. ",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2008 10:34AM - edited Mar 1, 2008 02:07PM by LindaLou53 Hi Bobbie, Well it has been 2 years since I first developed the LE and I have only started to row in the last month. My LE was quite problematic from the start and it has taken this long to get it under good control through intensive therapy with multiple modalities. These include CDT, compression garments, flexitouch pump, Kinesio taping, rebounding, and most recently Lebed exercises and cool Laser treatments. In addition I have regularly been seeing a PT for core strengthening exercises and working on increasing range of motion in my shoulders which was impaired from the surgery and radiation. I just this month got the OK to start doing the gentle rowing with minimal resistance on the flywheel. It is actually helping my shoulder issues and I definitely need the cardiovascular workout. My real goal is to hopefully get back to golfing this summer after a 3 year hiatus due to the cancer. With my hand stiffness due to the LE I may need to get larger grips but I'm planning to give it a go this Spring :) Ok, in your case Bobbie since you have not been officially dx'd with LE but are certainly at risk and are having some possible early symptoms, you need to take on any change in exercise slowly and with caution. If you are already doing some forms of exercise, and it sounds like you are, you might start to incorporate brief sessions rowing for like 3-5 min only with the lowest resistance setting on your rower. Make sure you do not try to overdo, it is not necessary to keep up a hard pace, just slow easy strokes so you do not get to the point of breathlessness. After the first day or two, closely monitor your arm for any changes in size or sensation. You may have some generalized body soreness from starting a new exercise, which is normal. Just take it slow, keep up your other exercise routines and continue to work up gradually to a pace that is beneficial without causing any negative impact on your arm. Rowing is really a great exercise on many levels, it helps strengthen leg and shoulder muscles, tuck in your abs while rowing for good core strength and to help protect your back. It is great for aerobic conditioning also. I actually started out rowing this past month for only 2 min sessions just due to my poor aerobic conditioning. I used to participate at the local YMCA in rowing competitions almost 15 years ago. I could row straight for a full hour at a decent stroke/min and often did 10,000 meter sets. So it has been a big bruise to my ego when now I'm huffing and puffing after 5min Lol! But I keep telling myself progress while slow, is still being made... and besides I'm now 15 years older! :) Oh and of course ALWAYS wear your sleeve and glove anytime you exercise!",

As to whether or not having scar revision surgery could impact your LE, yes it is possible anytime there is additional disruption to your lymphatic system.   Simple scar revision most likely will not involve removing any additional functional lymph nodes, but it could still disrupt the very fragile lymphatic vessels that lie just below the skin.  Having any kind of surgery causes a temporary inflammatory process in even normal tissue, but inflammation can be particularly problematic with lymphedematous tissue. If you were to decide for the surgery it would be wise to see your physio and have a couple days of good MLD sessions prior to the surgery, wear your compression garments if possible during surgery, and then again be evaluated by your physio soon after surgery to see if further MLD is needed to help counteract the normal inflammation caused by surgery. Does that mean you can never...ever...have any kind of surgery again?  No, but it does mean that any procedure carries some risk with it, most likely small with small surgeries.  You just have to weigh in the balance the benefit of having a surgery that you either need or want.",

Also if your arm is improving with treatment and there has been an actual reduction in size, that could also account for the loose top. But if your sleeve would not stay up from the moment you got it new, that is another issue. If your sleeve is a non-custom, off the shelf type which uses your therapist's measurements to find the proper size range you fit in, it could be your arm is just too small at the top for the size range you are in. While a custom sleeve may cost a little more, it will be made to your specific arm measurements at all points and I think you will find it much more comfortable and effective to wear. I have seen the sleeves with a torso strap and I would think that would be just another aggravation, but I have never worn one so can't speak from personal experience. I do wear custom fit sleeves with a 3/4 silicone bead top that always stays up on my arm. The 1/4 area without the silicone goes under the arm near the tender axilla and is more comfortable for me than the full silicone tops. I stay fairly active, use a rowing machine and bounce on a rebounder without any slippage of my sleeve. I would suggest you try a couple of things. First, have your sleeve replaced if it is more than 6 months old if you can swing it financially or with insurance. Consider trying a different type of sleeve, maybe one with a silicone top just to judge the difference for yourself. I will always recommend a custom fit sleeve over one that is designed to fit arms within a similar range of sizes. While non-custom may fit some points just right on your arm, it could be less than ideal at other points, resulting in a loose fit that allows the LE to increase, or too tight in some areas that can cause redness and discomfort. I can honestly say that even though I wear a Class 3 Jobst custom Elvarex, which is one of the thickest and most compressive sleeves you can find, I can wear mine for 16+ hours a day and not experience discomfort or sagging tops. I replace mine every 6 months and having accurate measurements from an experienced therapist will also ensure a good, comfortable fit. Hope you can can find a solution that works for you!",

Generally speaking any kind of water therapy is great for lymphedema, but especially when the body is totally immersed and benefits from the compression water provides. Some rigorous movements and physical exertion though, may have a negative impact if it really increases the circulation and lymphatic flow. I would think if you and your wife are both experienced scuba divers and this is an activity she is accustomed to, just take it slow to begin with. Keep the excursions brief and slow swimming until she can determine what impact if any it has on her LE. It certainly sounds like a great way to have fun, some good exercise and very likely could even benefit her LE when done cautiously to start. Let us know how it works out for her!",

      "Content": "LindaLou53 wrote:  Hello All!   I know I have certainly been scarce on these forums this last year but that is because Life is busier than ever and I continue to get involved in new activities and adventures! I had my annual scans and bloodwork last month.  Scans again came back NED!  Bloodwork all normal except for a Ca27:29 tumor marker that was 1 pt over the high normal range. While it was my highest result for that test yet, I knew from past discussions and readings here that most tumor markers are unreliable and certainly a few points difference were not significant.  I was not concerned at all and my original onc would never have even made mention of it, but my new onc did request I get it re-checked a month later.  I did the re-check yesterday and my numbers dropped 11 points, well into the normal range! SO...as far as I know I remain cancer free 12 years out from my first dx and almost 7 years out (in Nov) from my very locally advanced second dx! I stopped taking the IV Zometa last July 2011 after 5 years of infusions.  I remain on Aromasin daily and will for the indefinite future since I tolerate it so well.  I  passed 6 years on Aromasin this past May. There have been a few significant changes in my cancer world this last year.  My beloved onc who started treating me in 2000 with my first BC dx informed her patients late last year that she was making a career change.  She moved out of our area, back to the East Coast to immerse herself into research and professorship at an area university, while she also spends time with her aging father.  I really felt like someone pulled the rug out from under me when I got the news, since I credit my onc with making innovative and leading edge decisions regarding my treatment modalities. She was always unafraid to think out of the box and was so well read on the latest research data that I believe she is a big reason why I am still here today. Nothing stays the same however, so I found myself shopping for a new onc late last Fall.  I first went to the \"Big Name\" onc for an initial appointment, but knew immediately that my personality and his approach to medicine were not going to get along.  I have no doubt he is an expert in his field, but he is definitely \"old school\".  When I told him my desire was to monitor my status with annual scans and bloodwork and I hoped he was willing to trial me on Metformin, he immediately let me know he was not in agreement and it was his way or no way. Even with my degree of nodal involvement, he wanted no blood work at all, no scans and only would run diagnostics when I \"presented with symptoms\".  He was nice enough, but I need to know I am a part of the team making treatment decisions for myself and not just the object of the discussion. I know this is an ongoing debate about whether to closely monitor or wait for problems to develop, but I have long been in the camp that detecting and treating early is so much better than waiting til disease has spread enough to create symptoms.  I know of expert oncs and radiologists who totally disagree with the old aproach of \"what you don't know won't hurt you....why worry til you have to?\" attitude. So I reached out to a few professionals in the cancer world and found myself back at the same practice my original onc worked for.  I am now seeing another onc there who has been in practice for some time.  She is very approachable and flexible in her thinking which I like.  We have already had the Metformin discussion and I have agreed to compromise and wait til the first formal early reports come out from the current trial, which may be later this year. She already ran the Hemoglobin AC1 test on me and while pre-diabetic results are considered 5.7% - 6.4% my result was 5.4% and I have a family history, so maybe I can push for diabetes prevention. I am planning, though to discuss the Metformin issue with my PMD later this week also.  I know that the practice my new onc works for is a participant in the clinical trial of Metformin. While I do not meet the criteria to participate in the trial myself, it is possible my onc has her hands tied about prescribing the Metformin to me outside the trial setting. So I am going to explore my options with my PMD and see if he can network with my onc for her approval. I do not want to start off on the wrong foot with my new onc since I believe she will be easy to work with and she is certainly open to any discussion I want to have.  SO...if I have to wait a little longer for more data to be available I will probably do so. I had a little lymphedema event right before Christmas last year and have now developed early stage LE in my right arm in addition to my longstanding Stage 2 LE of the left arm, but it is well under control and I am staying on top of things with my therapists. I continue to work in the local LE community by being assistant moderator of the monthly Lymphedema Support Group I helped start over 5 years ago.  I visit the local PT school as a patient case study for the clinical Lymphedema portion of their curriculum each year. I also assist my therapist when she works as instructor of LE therapist certification courses held in my area.  I am actively involved with several other LE projects both local and national which hopefully will bear fruit soon for the whole LE community! I have also taken up a new hobby....quilting!  I have always liked to sew and used to do a lot of hand crochet and embroidery work, but with the LE any handwork is much more difficult and tiresome to do.  So a good friend introduced me to quilting and I have become somewhat obsessed with the hobby! When I am not running the household, going to meetings or working on my LE projects you will find me in my basement family room which has now been converted to my sewing/quiting studio! I just finished a quilt for my 84 year old father who is still running an active farm in the midwest.  He likes blue and I found fabric with blue chickens and roosters I thought would be perfect for him!  Here is a look at my latest project:   I also made a wall hanging quilt that taught me alot about adding applique and stitch details to my quilts: So I guess the bottom line of all this random chatting is.....I am doing FINE!  Staying very busy...enjoying new hobbies and so very GLAD and GRATEFUL that I am still here and able to count my blessings every day! So as I like to do at least once a year, I want all the newly diagnosed ladies to take heart!  Fight Hard! I know there are lots of dark moments and doubts about the future during your early diagnosis and treatment phase, but there really is a LIGHT at the end of the tunnel!  You will get done with treatments, your body will start to recover, and you will find with time that Life takes on a whole new sweetness and joy!

I am so happy you posted this because it is encouraging to know that good quality lymphedema care can be found. Hang on to that therapist and be sure to pass the info along to any other friends or patients you know dealing with LE or who are at risk. You might consider followups every 3-6 months with this therapist to again have the bio impedence measurements and limb volume calculations to stay on top of any changes. Particularly if you begin to notice any unusual sensations or discomfort in your at risk limb. Early detection is the key and it seems your therapist is well setup to do that. :)",

      "Content": "Mar 18, 2014 07:00AM - edited Mar 18, 2014 07:03AM by LindaLou53 Hi mnmbeck!   Yes you can wear a compression sleeve and glove/gauntlet for many procedures both surgical and diagnostic where you will be asleep due to either general anesthesia or IV sedation.  I have worn my sleeve and glove while under sedation for colonoscopy and biopsies.  I will be wearing them this week while under general anesthesia for a brief surgery.  The OR staff is well able to maintain the sterile field as needed and also monitor you continuously, so I would not worry about wearing your garments for the exchange procedure. We are cautioned not to wear daytime compression sleeves regularly at night because many sleeves have a tendency to slip or roll down from the top of the arm.  During the daytime we are often tugging or pulling the sleeves back up without hardly thinking about it.  But when we are in a deep sleep if our sleeve rolls down, it can cause increased compression on our arms that will worsen the swelling and could possibly do damage over several hours. If someone routinely has problems with the sleeve slipping down, they should seriously consider being measured for a new sleeve which is a better fit.  But there are other reasons we should not wear our daytime garments for prolonged or night time sleeping. Daytime garment materials and construction work differently than night time garments.  A daytime garment is designed to help control our swelling while our bodies and muscles are in action.  Daytime garments use the constant movement of our muscles to help maintain proper compression and keep our swelling to a minimum during our daily activities.  They do not typically reduce our swelling, they keep it from getting worse. Night time garments are constructed to work best while our bodies and muscles are at rest.  A night time garment, properly fitted, is designed to work better at reducing our swelling overnight.  Only short stretch bandage wrapping at night does a better job of reducing swelling. From a practical viewpoint, however, how many of us take an afternoon nap or fall asleep watching TV while wearing our garments? I certainly do often and suffer no problems, but my sleeves usually tend to stay up. I suppose if someone was scheduled for a lengthy, multi-hour procedure under anesthesia it might make more sense to wear a night time garment? P.S.  And your PS is correct that wearing your garments will be a deterrent from having your LE arm used for IVs, blood draws or blood pressures!  :)",

      "Content": "Jul 21, 2009 12:30AM - edited Jul 21, 2009 01:51AM by LindaLou53 Lovinmomma, Nanalinda is right....you should ask for a Power Port which will allow for blood draws, chemo infusions and also injecting the dyes for your scans. Dswope, Generally the choice of having a port for chemo is made for one or more of the following reasons: 1. The patient has a low tolerance for needle sticks and feels more comfortable using a port. (the nurses usually prefer it too for convenience) 2.  The patient's veins are fragile or difficult to stick and a port guarantees easy access for infusions and blood draws. 3. The patient has a bilateral risk for lymphedema or another existing medical condition, and is not willing to risk either arm to needle sticks. 4.  The patient's chemo regimen will involve frequent infusions of caustic chemo over a long period of time, which could cause long term damage to the peripheral veins.  The port would protect those arm veins for access if needed in the future when a port is no longer needed. Ports are being used more frequently now than they were when I was first diagnosed in 2000.  Ports have been improved, the power port being an example, providing more functionality.  It still requires special training to access a port though, not every RN or lab tech will be able to do so unless they have been certified. If a patient starting chemo, has good healthy peripheral veins on their unaffected arm and has no particular worry about being stuck with needles, a lot of them choose to get chemo thru the peripheral IVs. Particularly if they are on a chemo schedule of infusions every 21 days vs the more frequent weekly infusions many patients get today. If you poll women who have had ports you will find very many who loved them and would not have wanted to do chemo without them.  You will also find women who hated them and could not wait to get rid of them. Ports certainly have a purpose and in many cases are absolutely necessary, above and beyond the convenience factor for both the patient and the nurses. As with all medical procedures, however, they are not free of risk.  It is a minor surgical procedure to have them placed, there is an ongoing risk of infection and clotting through out the period the port is in place.  They must be protected and maintained with regular flushes. They can be a chronic irritation, depending on their placement, due to chaffing from bra straps and clothing. It boils down to the individual's comfort level, the status of their peripheral veins or other medical conditions that would make using the arms a higher risk than using a port. Lovinmomma, Regarding your question about where to put your IV when you get your new port placed, it really is whatever you feel most comfortable with.  It sounds like your left arm had no nodes removed but would still be considered at risk because you had a bilateral mastectomy.  If you feel more comfortable having the IV in your foot instead of your left arm then be sure to ask for that.  In terms of degree of risk, having a needle stick on an arm without any axillary nodes removed would be less risky than an arm with nodes removed.  Thats not to say it can't happen, because we know of women who have developed lymphedema based on mastectomy alone, no nodal removal. But it is still more a rarity than not. I will say that I have continued to use my right arm for all IV sticks, blood draws and contrast media for the last 3.5 years following my second BC diagnosis. My right arm had 6 nodes removed in 2000 during a SNB for my first cancer, but I never developed lymphdema in it.  When I had a second primary BC in 2005 in the other breast, I had 23 nodes removed and did develop lymphedema in my left arm.  I had to decide whether or not to use my right arm for sticks or have a port.  I chose to use my right arm and so far that has worked for me. I fully recognize that I will always be at risk, but for now it is a risk I am willing to take. I am certainly not trying to change anyones mind about their choice to have a port or use feet/leg veins for their infusions.  This is strictly a statement of my personal choice and what I felt I could best live with. Making difficult decisions has become a way of life for all of us dealing with cancer. Nothing seems to be cut and dried, but always has to be in a gray area of uncertainty. As much as we want to control every aspect of our care and its outcomes, we find that it is just not possible. Still, I strongly feel it is worth the effort and energy it takes to be as educated and informed as possible, to be proactive in our thinking and take as many precautions as seem proven and reasonable to us. Best wishes to you Lovinmomma for your new port placement next week.  Remember, there are NO stupid questions.....but any question runs the risk of getting a very long winded answer like mine!  So be forewarned!    ",

If the bloodwork comes back ok (they are usually checking the WBC) they go ahead and hang the chemo.  If the chemo will not be given based on bloodwork, they would have to remove the IV but at least it was still one stick and blood was drawn instead of having 2 sticks and still not get your chemo. The other issue is that for any patient having weekly chemo and blood draws, 2 sticks each week is using up twice the veins and increasing the chances of having problems finding good veins the next week. Protecting our natural resources applies to our bodies just like it does to Mother Earth!  Lets not be wasteful with our veins when we have a limited supply available. ",

I certainly do not want to discourage anyone from having a port who is at risk for LE and will reiterate that my choice was made with the full knowledge that there would be a risk in using my arm veins.  If you do choose to continue having your chemo thru peripheral IVs there are a few precautionary measures you can take that may decrease your risk of complications. Definitely hydrate yourself well the day before, during and after your chemo.  Keep your arms covered up and in warm clothing if in Winter or cold air conditioned rooms. Use a warm washcloth or warm packs if necessary to help pop out the veins in your arm before they start the IV. Make sure the chemo nurses are aware of your LE risk with nodes removed on both sides.  Advise them that you prefer they use the smallest gauge needle possible for your particular type of chemo.  Do not allow them to keep the plastic compression tourniquet around your arm for any extended length of time.  If they are checking all over your arm, hunting for veins, they will have to do it before applying the tourniquet.  Sometimes a nurse may leave the tourniquet in place as they run back for supplies or get distracted by a conversation with another co-worker, do NOT allow this.  I happen to believe that the compression produced by regular blood pressure cuffs and blood work tourniquets presents a higher risk to our LE than a sterile needle stick. My chemo center uses the small wrist BP cuffs and I have one of my own that I carry with me to any other doctor appointments. Obviously the nurse should be wearing gloves, have cleansed your skin before the stick and practice good sterile technique. These are not usually issues in a chemo center but you never know when someone new is in training or just having a busy day so takes shortcuts. It should also be the case than any bloodwork you need is drawn from the same stick they made for the IV.  If you are getting stuck twice, once for blood and once for the IV that is something that should be questioned. If the nurse appears to have any trouble finding the vein once she has inserted the IV catheter needle, don't allow a lot of digging and jabbing at your arm. I have had excellent chemo nurses work on me but they still have a policy that if they can't hit the vein in 2 sticks they stop trying and get someone else to try. Once you get to know your nurses and they get to know your arm, it is sometimes better to have the same 1 or 2 nurses always stick you for consistent success. While your chemo is infusing, the nurses will check on you when they can, but you can also monitor your arm more frequently than they can for any signs that there may be problems developing at the IV site. Sometimes veins will blow or just not flow smoothly depending on positioning and size of the vein.  Its not uncommon to have a little sensitivity at the site during infusion or even a small amount of slight redness, but if you notice obvious pain, increasing swelling, leaking or redness at the site, alert your nurses immediately. Generally speaking, chemo nurses are experts at starting infusions and well experienced at troubleshooting IV problems.  It never hurts though to be an extra pair of eyes in a busy chemo center when they need to know something is wrong. After the chemo infusion is done and the needle catheter is removed, make sure a proper bandage or bandaid is placed and pressure applied to the site. If the needle stick is not bleeding when the catheter is removed you might ask to have triple antibiotic ointment applied before they place the dressing, but often the nurse has the needle out and bandage on so fast you don't have time to do it then.  I often wait til I get to the car or home to remove their bandage, apply my antibiotic ointment and then place my own bandaid.  Make sure enough time has passed and there is no more active bleeding on the original bandage before you remove it however.  Your hands should be clean also when dressing a fresh stick. This may all seem very OCD and anxiety producing, but in reality it is just a matter of being tuned in to ways to help make your infusion experience go more smoothly and help reduce your risk of LE at the same time.

I do have Stage IIIC locally advanced disease.  My oncologist placed me on Zometa immediately following the completion of my chemo and radiation in 2006 because she was aware of the early study data showing promising results in preventing mets to the bone.  At that time Zometa was typically only given to women with stage IV bone mets and was given on a monthly infusion basis.  We were concerned about the risk of ONJ and I was not comfortable taking the Zometa monthly, so we initially agreed upon every 3 months. I had 6 doses over the first 18 months and then in early 2008 we decided to switch to every 6 months based on further study data becoming available.  I had an additional 3 doses over the next 18 months for 9 doses total by July 2009. I will be seeing my oncologist next Monday for my 6 month checkup, CXR and tumor markers.  Unless she has new information, we are planning to continue the Zometa on an annual basis and I will receive my 10th dose this coming July.  Neither of us were comfortable going off the Zometa completely given my nodal count, but I am also hopeful that more detailed research will give us answers to the questions about continued benefit, drug half-life and ONJ risk with long term usage.  I plan on picking my onc's brain on this issue Monday so I will let you know if there is any new data regarding staying on Zometa for longer than 3 years.",

Please make sure you have exhausted all other treatments which are the gold standard for lymphedema care. Surgery is not a \"cure\" or easy fix at all.

      "Content": "Jan 18, 2010 11:34PM - edited Jan 18, 2010 11:36PM by LindaLou53 Update as requested:  I saw my onc today for my 6 month checkup.  I asked her if there had been any new research to indicate whether extending zometa infusions for longer than 3 years was advised or discouraged.  She said there was no research data specific to women without mets who took Zometa for longer than 3 years to prevent a recurrence.  Since I completed 3 years (9 doses) last July, she is still advising me to take a single Zometa dose once a year until further data becomes available. It really is not so much a factor of how many years on Zometa as it is how many doses and how frequent the dosing intervals are.  Women who take Zometa solely for preventing a recurrence or to reverse osteoporosis generally only take infusions twice a year. Whereas women who have Stage IV bone mets generally have infusions every 4 weeks, sometimes for many years. The incidence of side effects seems to be more prevalent in women with frequent intervals and long term (many years) dosing. I asked her which side effects I should be most concerned about.  She stated that renal issues are really not a worry if there has not been a prior history of renal disease and blood creatinine levels and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) are normal.  She said the biggest concern with Zometa is the change it causes in the bone's ability to heal itself.  No one knows for sure just how long Zometa continues to affect the bone's normal ability to generate new bone growth.  They do know it appears to continue to affect the bones for years, even after the Zometa has been stopped.  She said that anyone taking Zometa should avoid any tooth extractions, dental implants or surgery on the jawbone.  Routine cleanings, fillings, crowns and root canals do not pose a problem as long at the tooth root and jawbone is not disturbed. So I will get my next Zometa infusion this July.  I always get dental cleanings and checkups every 6 months.  I have had fillings and broken teeth that needed crowns during the time I have been on Zometa and have not had any problems.  I will be scheduling the replacement of several very old silver amalgam fillings over the next couple of years and will plan to do them 10-12 months after my Zometa infusions if that helps at all.   I have not had a bone density test since before starting Zometa in 2006.  Even though I have been on Aromasin for almost 4 years and it is known to decrease bone density, my onc says that the Zometa will have totally counteracted any affect the Aromasin might have had on my bones.  She feels there is no need to do a bone density test now that I have been on Zometa. My CXR, blood and tumor marker test results should be available in a few days.  I have every reason to believe that I continue to be NED now 4 years and 1 month out from my Stage 3C dx with 23/23 positive nodes.  My onc says I am her \"big success story!\" and I want to keep it that way! P.S.  my onc also mentioned that new research is showing there may be a possible relationship between high blood insulin levels and cancer growth.  It seems that not only do some tumors respond to the presence of hormones in the body, but that high levels of insulin may also \"feed\"  tumor growth much the same as hormones do in ER/PR + tumors. She said that some discussion is being given to putting cancer patients who have high insulin levels on a diabetic medication called \"Metformin\"  also known as Glucophage.  They believe that Metformin may have an anti-tumor  affect and could become a drug used for prevention of cancer.

P.S. Binney, several Flu Vaccination centers are still using the standard Fluzone injections or offer all versions.  My husband just got his shot today at his employer and they are not using the Intradermal version.  I guess a person could call ahead to find out what is available. I don't know if the plan is to eventually phase out the IM injections or not.  The current intradermal is only available for age 18-64.  As vlnrph mentions above, there is a high dose intradermal version available for those 65 and older.  I suspect I will continue to get the intradermal in my thigh, especially since it eliminates the issues I have run into in the past where the proper size needle or technique for a safe IM injection was not always practiced. My primary reason for posting was to warn anyone considering using an \"at risk\" limb, that the increased degree of local inflammation with the intradermal flu shot could be a problem.",

I did experience stinging when the vaccine was injected and an immediate \"wheal\" or small swollen nodule developed, very similar to the swelling seen from a PPD (TB) skin test.  The area quickly became reddened and itchy which the nurse had said was typical.  The itchyness went away after about 15 minutes but the redness and induration has persisted.  This morning I have an approx 2 inch diameter reddened, indurated area on my upper thigh.  It is not painful, but is warm to touch and a definite area of mild inflammation. I mention this only to warn other persons with \"at risk\" limbs that the inflammatory process with the intradermal shots appears to be much higher than the standard flu shot.  I would definitely not allow anyone to use an \"at risk\" limb for the injection.  After looking at the detailed literature from the Fluzone website I found the following table comparing adverse reactions between the new Intradermal injection and the standard Fluzone injection for adults aged 18-64:  As you can see there are significantly more local inflammatory reactions with the Intradermal than the standard Fluzone injection.  I think persons who truly hate needles might prefer the intradermal method, but in the long run you may be dealing with more local discomfort anyway.  I especially think that no flu injection should ever be given in an at risk LE limb, and the intradermal injection may be an even a higher LE risk than the standard. The one \"good\" thing about the intradermal is there are many locations it can be given since it does not involve concerns about avoiding deep blood vessels or nerves as the Intramuscular injections do.  Any area of the skin on a non-involved or non-at risk limb should be useable for the intradermal injection even though current literature refers only to the upper arm area.",

      "Content": "Jun 25, 2008 02:35PM LindaLou53 wrote: \"Is my arm supposed to look like a road map when I take off the sleeve? Should I be seeing deep and reddened grooves CAUSED by the sleeve?\"  Hi Diane, Well my response to your questions would be \"yes\" your arm may very well look like a roadmap after removing your night time garment and \"no\" you should not be seeing \"DEEP\" or \"REDDENED\" grooves.  The purpose of night time wrapping, whether it is using short stretch bandages or garments like the Reid Sleeve or JoviPak etc., is to reduce the fluid volume of the arm overnight.  Then the daytime sleeves and gloves are designed to \"maintain\" the volume of the arm throughout the day but are not intended to do further reduction.  Because lymphedema is the presence of lymphatic fluid in the extracellular tissues, it follows logic that compressing the extracellular tissue will displace the fluid.  The goal of \"PROPER\" compression garments is to provide a gradient pressure that will direct that displaced fluid into the proper direction for drainage at the larger drain sites in the body.  The degree to which your arm looks like a \"road map\" will be a variable of the amount of lymph fluid your body produces, the viscosity or thickness of that lymph fluid, the distance that fluid has to travel before it can be properly drained into the larger venous system and also the proper or improper fit of your night time garment will impact the movement of fluid. I wear a Jovipak night time sleeve which has long channels of chipped foam for compression.  Every morning when I take my sleeve off you can see where the wide channels of chipped foam have compressed and pushed the fluid to the path of least resistance which is the small narrow seams stitched between the channels of compression foam.  So every morning my arm has long thin but firm areas of lymph fluid visible in a pattern which reflects the pattern of the night time garment.   My LE is stage 2 and the fluid is very thick and viscous so it does not move out of the arm easily without more massage and other alt therapies. (I use a rebounder, cool laser, Kinesio Tape etc.) I also had total axillary disection so my fluid must move to the neck, groin or belly to drain fully. I only know what my personal experience is with my type of LE, but I would think that women with stage 1, very fluid LE might well see their arm look almost normal every morning if the use of compression and elevation effectively move the fluid completely out during the night.  One thing I have learned is that there are as many different variations in LE as there are people who have LE.  Some manage to get by, wearing just a sleeve, not a glove and do not have problems with hand swelling.  Others, like myself, would have major hand swelling if I never wore a glove. Some can just elevate their arm and gravity alone can move the fluid out, but that is not the case for everyone.  I would think having a \"roadmap\" on your arm is pretty standard for alot of women, but it may also be an indication that you need to be a little more proactive in other ways for keeping the fluid moving.  I typically spend at least 10-15 min in the shower every morning doing my massage gently moving the fluid.  I make sure I  massage the neck and groin area first, take lots of deep belly breaths, massage down my sides from axilla to groin and then work on moving fluid up my arm to the shoulder and neck area.  I then always towel dry in the proper direction.  My \"roadmap\" is usually gone by then.  Regarding your question about very DEEP grooves and REDNESS, I would always be worried that your garment is not fitting properly if you truly have deep, painful red marks. Certainly, any constriction that causes pain, numbnes, blanching in your arm is not working as intended and needs to be followed up with your fitter or therapist.  Trying to get a true gradient pressure with bandages and garments is an art and so you do need to monitor your arm for signs that the garment you wear is not performing its job. Hope this helps!  And I want to thank the person who posted the link for the LE Self Care Classes online.  I know Joanne the spokesperson, she is the owner/developer of the JoviPak garments and has dedicated her life to LE education since developing LE herself.  I have met her at various LE conferences and she is truly dedicated to getting the word out about LE.  I have not had a chance yet to listen to her online classes but plan to do so.  Bear in mind that there will always be some variability in the content of classes on LE.  There are many schools of thought on the physiology and function of the lymphatic system as ongoing research reveals more data.  But I do believe that gaining a basic understanding of the body, the lymphatic system and how Lymphedema affects the delicate balance of multiple systems is certainly a big  component of our being able to  manage our own LE more efficiently and competently. ",

      "Content": "Aug 14, 2008 11:37PM - edited Aug 14, 2008 11:39PM by LindaLou53 Hi Liz, Kinesio Tape has been used for years for sports injury and started being used for lymphedema around 1995. It has gained popularity in recent years as more LE therapists see its benefits for their patients. You are right to have a trained therapist show you the proper application technique for LE because it is different from how the tape is used for muscle injury. There are different versions of Kinesio Tape available but the Kineso \"Gold\" is the original tape best designed specifically for lymphedema use. Application of the tape requires a slight stretch but both anchor ends of the tape should not be stretched in order to prevent shearing on the skin. Persons with delicate skin or sensitivities should test the tape first on a small area of skin. Some individuals may not be able to tolerate the tape or its removal. The tape is designed to stay in place for 3-5 days and is water resistant so can be worn in the shower and when swimming. The mechanism by which Kinesio tape is believed to help lymphedema is by slightly lifting the skin, creating a larger space for lymph fluid to flow, as the action of your muscles causes the tape to gently move the skin similar to MLD. The tape provides a \"mini\" MLD massage throughout the day as you wear it. I have been using KT for about 2 years now off and on and find it to be very effective. In particular on my hand and the swelling down my side, the tape would help to reduce the puffiness. I could wear the tape for 5-7 days without problem. It usually was easier to remove the longer I had been wearing it. I would rest my skin for a couple days, making sure it was off anytime I had a professional MLD appointment, and would then reapply a few days later. It is easy to learn how to apply it yourself but you should start out with a therapist showing you the basics.

I will tell you in retrospect I realized that for almost a week before I developed a red, hot spot on my LE arm I had been feeling \"tired\" and headachy and just \"off\" which was very unusual for me. I did not associate it with the cellulitis at all until after the fact. Sometimes it takes several days or weeks for a low grade infection to \"brew\" before it turns into more acute symptoms of redness, heat, pain, fever and chills etc.  Once it reaches that state however, it is a true medical emergency.  Having antibiotics on hand when you first start to recognize the symptoms can often shorten the length and severity of the infection. I was not allowed to wear my sleeve and glove while my arm was still red and hot to touch, but by 48 hours after being on antibiotics that had improved enough I could start wearing compression again.  Hope, I would continue your course of antibiotics until completed and then be sure to have a discussion with your regular onc or whichever doctor you would like to order your prophylactic antibiotics to keep on hand.  Keflex seems to be the most common choice. If your redness and warmth are still present on Monday,  then Levaquin may not be totally effective against whatever bacteria is causing your infection.  Definitely check in with your doctor if not improved.

One of the most important factors in buying a wrist BP cuff is to get one that has a positional sensor that will not allow you to take a BP reading until your wrist and arm are in proper placement next to the heart.  No matter what type of cuff you use, a BP reading's accuracy is affected tremendously by the technique used.  Size of the cuff in relation to the size of the limb being measured, proper application of the cuff and in the case of the using a stethoscope to hear the systolic and diastolic on the old sphygmomanometer BP units, (like most physician offices) it also is highly subjective to the BP taker's hearing acuity! The advantage of the digital wrist cuffs is they are simple to self-apply, with the position sensor you are guaranteed consistent accurate placement, and with the digital readout no need for stethoscopes or good hearing. The real secret to meaningful BP readings is being able to record a general pattern of readings that can show the trend for either normal or abnormal pressures.  One BP reading by itself has very little meaning especially when different cuffs or devices are used each time.  Owning your own wrist cuff allow you to track your own trends consistently.   I own the Omron HEM-670 IT which even allows me to connect it to my PC and download all the readings that are stored in memory.  The software program creates graphs and reports you can print out and take to your doctors office to show him the trend on your own equipment....vs the single reading they do in the office that usually involves a quick, improperly taken pressure while the nurse is asking questions and your results end up showing elevation due to the \"white coat effect\". I do not use the wrist cuff on my LE arm but I do use it on my at risk arm which had 6 nodes removed 10 years ago.  Obviously there is a risk in everything we do and for some they prefer the leg or calf BP measurments in all situations.  I believe the risks involved with a wrist BP cuff are certainly lower than using the standard upper arm cuffs. There is much reduced squeezing on the wrist cuffs and with the digital program it releases the pressure appropriately after the systolic is detected as opposed to many office staff who pump every cuff up to over 200 no matter whether the patient has hypertension or not. Whether or not someone at risk for LE chooses to use a wrist BP cuff is a matter of their personal comfort level and risk tolerance.  The wrist BP cuff has been a workable solution for me but I am not pushing this choice for others, only trying to point out the options available. We each must decide what feels right for us.",

The language can be totally overwhelming for the average layperson and even for persons in the medical field with no prior experience dealing with cancer. I think we each know our personalities best.  If we are going to be more worried getting a report we don't understand and misinterpret the results prior to seeing the doctor, then I believe it is best to wait for the discussion with your medical professionals.  That is assuming, of course, you are lucky enough to have a physician who takes the time to thoroughly explain the results and all the available options to your full satisfaction. I know that my coping mechanism is to gain as much knowledge as I can about my medical condition. I want to be able to ask informed questions of my doctors and feel like I am an integral part of my medical team.  Knowing this, I am a big proponent of getting test results whether it be scans, bloodwork or pathology reports prior to the scheduled doctors appointment. I get my CT scan results within 24 hours once they have been entered into the hospital's database system and my doctor has had a chance to review them first.  Her staff then faxes a copy of the report to me routinely.  I usually have my consultation appointment with the doctor a week or so following the scans. When I have bloodwork drawn at the chemo center they can immediately give me the CBC results, the tumor marker and chem profile results are faxed to me a couple days later. Since I see my docs every 3 months, I don't have to wait that long for the lab results. With pathology reports, I always request the preliminary report which is usually available within 24-48 hours following the procedure.  I also get the final report when it is available.  It usually just takes a phone call to the doctor's office to let the staff know you want the reports.  The only reason they may delay sending a copy is if my doctor has not yet seen the results first herself. Given that most hospital based practices are now instantly connected to test results when logged into their database systems, there really is no need to wait for weeks to get results. The other thing I do approx every 2-3 years is go to the Medical Records dept at the hospital where I get all my CT scans, PETs, Dopplers...etc. and have them put all my actual scan images along with the final reports on CD.  This is a great way to archive and store all your major medical tests.  It also comes in handy if you ever want to seek a second opinion and can show up with a CD the doctor can pop into his computer and review right there with you.  Most hospitals now offer this as a free service or for a minimal charge. My anxiety related to my illness is greatly reduced when I feel I have accurate knowledge of what is going on.  While it may be true we have little control over the big picture, I believe the choices we make regarding our treatment plan are best made when we educate ourselves to the best of our ability.This is why sites like BC.org are so valuable. I learned the lingo and how to interpret path reports in large part from articles and posts I read here. I find that there is always someone here with more experience, greater knowledge and insight that I can benefit from. As a general precaution, however, I would always recommend that information you gain from any online support site be verified and confirmed with your doctor or through other reputable online sources.",

I hate to think that a grassroots movement to finally get surgeons to consider presurgical baseline measurement and evaluation would be negatively affected by an inaccurate method of measurement.  Hopefully, there will be a push for more aggressive research and verification of data.  No point sticking with a method proven not to work, but sure hate to leave a sour taste in the mouth of the few open minded physicians willing to trial such a system. ",

Today, Carol Waller's petition to the Nova Scotia Government to cover compression garments for those with secondary lymphedema was presented to the Nova Scotia Legislature and met with unprecedented success. The day started with a press conference at 10 AM, which although not too well attended, started the ball rolling. Health Critic Dave Wilson, a former paramedic, was there, underlining how important they thought this issue was. We were introduced by NDP MLA Marilyn More, whose office is downstairs from the BCANS office. We were very fortunate to have been joined by Sandra Carr, a survivor who has lymphedema, wears a sleeve and a glove, and was an eloquent and effective spokesperson about how it is to live with it and how it has affected her life. NDP press secretary Kathryn Morse distributed copies of the press release and media package to those members of the press who didn't come, in time to create a buzz of interest in the issue. By the time Chris d'Entremont, Minister of Health, arrived at the house, the press were primed, and he met with a media scrum. He know there was an issue coming up because I suspect there were a few unnamed people at the press conference who alerted him to it. He issued a statement that you will hear on the news tonight that he is instructing his staff to look into the feasibility of covering the cost of compression garments for those suffering from secondary lymphedema. He said that he understands the importance and effectiveness of compression garments as his mother is a breast cancer survivor and wears a sleeve! In the afternoon we were escorted to the gallery of the legislature by Caroline Read, a researcher for the NDP caucus. Barb Thompson and I were very grateful for the support of fellow survivors, Peggy MacLean, Barbara Lawson and Allison Cunningham who joined us there. Marilyn More tabled the petition which sat wrapped in pink ribbons and tulle on the clerk's table in front of the speaker the whole time we were there. She rose again a little later to introduce us to the legislature. Although it was a bit of a wait, as we sat through motions and procedures, eventually it was question time. Dave Wilson asked one question pertaining to health coverage, then as his supplementary question, asked if the Minister of Health would be prepared to commit to a date for reporting on the findings of his department. Although (not unexpectedly) he wouldn't commit to a date, the minister did assure the speaker that his department will be looking into the matter and will report on their findings in a timely manner. After we left the gallery we were met by a gaggle of reporters from every news outlet in the city and even some national stringers. Paul Withers was there from CBC. CTV was there, probably Global as well. John Gillis from the Herald asked some questions and there were several radio stations represented as well. Sandra Carr had her arm photographed from every angle and she spoke at length about how it affects her. According to the NDP staff members, this is more than they ever dreamed of accomplishing in one day, and were extremely impressed by how effective we were, and how well prepared we were. This would not have been possible if it were not for the efforts of Carol Waller and Rose Bechtel. Carol had the drive to put together the petition and collect the signatures. Working with Rose they developed the information on lymphedema, prepared the letter to the MLA's and wrote Carol's story which gave so freely of her experience. Rose contacted Marilyn More and enlisted her support. They are both to be congratulated and thanked for their dedication. The help of NDP MLA, Marilyn More, Health Critic Dave Wilson, and the two staff from the NDP Caucus, Caroline Read and Kathryn Morse was so willingly and generously given that we scarcely have words to thank them. They were simply wonderful. Sandra Carr was introduced to us by Yvonne MacGregor just last week, and we are so grateful to them both. It was just in the nick of time that she appeared and she was clearly the best person for the job. On the way home tonight, I heard the story on two radio stations, and I fully expect that it will be covered by all the news shows and the Herald in the morning. __________________ Elaine F",

It is also still possible that the hand swelling might be due to something else.  Sounds like you are only a month out from your surgery and you are currently taking chemo?  You might want to make an appointment with the surgeon or oncologist also to rule out any other vascular/circulation problems. If it is LE your best bet is to make an appointment to see a certified LE therapist and let her evaluate the type of swelling you have.  She can measure both arms for a baseline and give you good info on what treatments would be appropriate for you at this time.  I know you have been considering buying some Swell spots for your hand but without an initial LE evaluation, treatment and proper fitting of garments it may be not as productive as it could be. Good luck.  Let us know how it goes. LindaLou",

Chris, never say never!   We do have to think about many of our actions now before doing them, find alternative, safer methods for doing the things we like to do, but there are very few things that are absolutely contraindicated in persons with LE. Part of the secret is becoming more aware of where the risks lie and having a game plan ready for how you will deal with those risks in advance.  There is no reason you should not be able to carry grocery bags or lift 4-6lb packages if you have taken steps to make that a safe activity.  If you learn to approach any new activity with the mindset of taking baby steps, gradually working up to a level that your body tolerates or that you are able to adequately manage without serious LE repercussions, you will find success in many areas. Our human bodies require a certain level of movement and exercise to stay healthy, maintain good muscle tone and strength.  None of us should have to give up any more strength or flexibility than we already have due to SE's of surgery, radiation, chemo and hormonal meds.  We have to be patient and smart about it, but we can regain much that has been lost.  There have been tons of discussions on this board about LE and exercise.  You will find many of our swell sisters leading extremely active, strong, healthy lives because they know their bodies well, learn to cautiously increase their efforts and proactively take the steps to reduce risk whenever they can. Regarding manicures, the biggest issue there is getting an infection from cross contaminated instruments used between clients.  There are many women who regularly get professional manicures but have purchased their own private set of instruments which they take with them to each manicure session.  Any soaking solutions should be changed out for fresh also in the salon.  I believe that false nails may be ill advised because of the risk of damage to the fragile cuticle area plus the moist environment created under the nail is a perfect breeding ground.  But a good nail trim and polish is certainly possible when done with safety measures in place. Chris, regarding your hands puffing up there could be many issues at play here.  If you experienced hand puffiness before you ever had any surgery or cancer treatments involving your lymph nodes, it was most likely not lymphedema at that time.  For most of us, hot, humid weather increases the capillary blood flow in our bodies and can result in some extra fluid rentention in our extremities.  Also high salt intake in our diets, menstrual cycles and certain medications can result in edema which is the result of extra water in the tissues.  This type of swelling is NOT lymphedema. Any swelling, tight rings etc that occur after a person has had lymph node removal, breast surgery or radiation should at least be suspect for early lymphedema.  Edema from lymphatic fluid is not the same as water edema and must be treated differently. A qualified LE therapist should be consulted for evaluation and measurements if the possibility of LE exists. I am not sure of your surgical history so whether you have a current risk for LE or not I don't know.  With your planned UMX and SNB you will then have a risk for LE but hopefully with the knowledge you are gaining now and risk prevention steps you can take, that risk will be lessened.",

So removing nodes has no therapeutic value and obsolete staging value.\" I had a SNB with my first BC dx 10 years ago in which 6 nodes were removed, none of which showed up as positive at the quick pathology check during the procedure.  However, a week later after the immunohistochemistry they found micrometastasis to 2 of the 6 nodes.  My surgeon wanted to schedule me for a full ALND.  My oncologist agreed with me, however, that since I would be getting both chemo and radiation due to the micromets there was no need to do further staging or removal of more nodes.  The treatment plan would not be changed based on an ALND. The SNB had done its job in providing proper staging of my cancer.  That was a decision I have been very happy I made. My BC history has unfortunately allowed me to see the coin from both sides and I would never go so far as to say that removing cancerous nodes does not have any therapeutic value.  With my second BC dx 5 years later (a new primary in the other breast) all the signs were ominous for nodal involvement.  Both breast MRI and PET/CT scans indicated high activity in the axillary area.  I still instructed my surgeon to start with the SNB procedure in the hope that she would not have to go any further. As it turned out every single one of the 23 nodes she ultimately had to remove were fully involved with cancer, to the extent that several had already ruptured (extracapsular extension) and many designated as having tumor loads greater than 5mm. As dismaying as it was to be told all my nodes were positive, I was very glad they were surgically removed.  As far as I was concerned they were 23 tumors requiring removal just as much as the primary tumor in my breast. I will never know what the outcomes might have been had I not had a total ALND.  I realize there is no way I can predict what the future holds either, but I feel very strongly that removing those cancerous nodes has played a role in why I am still here today.  Yes, I have lymphedema as a result, but in my book that is a price worth paying to be NED 5 years later with such a locally advanced cancer. I recognize that there are many varied presentations of BC and agree that there are certainly cases where ALND is not necessary or recommended.  But I do not believe that with our current treatment capabilities we can say nodal removal is never of any value. ",

When I saw my primary doc last year he made the comment \"well you're looking good!  Do you still have LE?\"  I just laughed, showed him my compression sleeve and glove and said \"what do you think?\" His comment was \"I can't really tell much difference between your arms\". Since he was walking out the door and heading to his next patient, I didn't have the time then to explain the finer points of LE presentation but decided to definitely catch him this year. SO....yesterday I went prepared. The visit always starts out with the nurse escorting me to the room after getting my height and weight.  She then always proceeds to take my vital signs.  As soon as she reaches for the full BP cuff I hand her my wrist BP cuff and tell her \"we have to use this, I'm at risk for LE in my right arm\".  I never have a problem with the nurses regarding taking my BP. Next my doc comes in and we talk in general about how things have been going.  I update him with all my recent blood work, scans and meds from the cancer center. Then I handed him a packet of information on LE and told him I wanted him to add this to his medical/staff educational reference material.  I included several of the recent NLN Lymphlink Articles,  the early detection and treatment interventions for LE, the effects of radiation therapy on patients who are at risk for LE, understanding the genetics of primary LE.  I also gave him copies of all the NLN position papers. I intentionally had removed my sleeve and glove prior to his entering the room, and he noted \"so its your left arm with LE right?\" I proceeded to point out the numerous landmarks on my arm and hand, had him do comparisons in texture and mobility of the skin, pointed out my areas of fibrosis,  made him check grip strength and range of motion differences between my hands, showed him the side profiles and my \"puffy\" elbow on the left compared to the well defined bony prominence of the elbow on the right. He was impressed with both the overt and subtle differences which could be clinically noted once you knew what to look for. He asked me about compression pumps since that was basically the only modality he had heard much about! I explained the downside to the old type of compression pumps, told him about the newer MLD based Flexitouch system.  Explained the basic components of MLD and the importance of daily clearing of the nodes in preparation for active drainage. THEN...we hit a wall of sorts.  He wanted to double check my BP because it had been slightly elevated when the nurse took it. ( lets see, I had just walked into the office, hopped up on the exam table and was trying to answer nurse questions while she was taking the BP, never given a chance to sit quietly for 5 min and get a \"normal\" resting BP)  Anyway, my doc was insisting on using the regular BP cuff because he had no way of knowing if the wrist BP cuff device was \"accurate\"  I told him my concerns about using a standard cuff, how the strong sustained compression of a cuff could certainly precipitate LE in an at risk arm and how I CERTAINLY did not want LE in my right arm also!  I told him I have used a wrist cuff at every doctors office for the last several years and it was the standard of care in the chemo center. I also told him he should be glad I let them use the wrist cuff and don't insist on using a thigh cuff on my leg instead.  His reply was it was a good thing I didn't insist on a thigh cuff because no one knew how to take BPs properly with them anyway! (keep in mind this was a good natured debate between old friends and was not becoming hostile in any way, but I was letting him know how seriously I take the subject) Finally, he said all he wanted to do was verify in his own mind, with his own eyes, that the wrist cuff readings would be similar to a reading he gets on the brachial artery in my antecubital using a standard cuff. Once he could do that, he would never ask to use a full cuff on my arm again.  I told him if he would promise to not pump the cuff up higher than 140 mmHg and would release the pressure quickly, I would allow him to check it this one time. He did the pressure as requested, I then double checked my pressure with the wrist cuff and the readings were within 2 points of being the same.  He was satisfied and told me he would never ask to use a standard cuff again.  I also decided I am going to gather up all the information I can find on the proper way to do thigh BPs and send it to him and his staff! We had a laugh over it, he thanked me again for all the LE information and clinical demonstrations. He admitted more than once that he and most of his medical peers do not have an understanding of LE at all.  I told him we were trying to change that and appreciated him being open minded to my input. I asked him if I could drop off some comprehensive Lymphedema pamplets for patients, plus leave my business card with contact info for our LE support group and that was fine with him. He wrote my annual prescription for prophylactic antibiotics in the event I start to develop cellulitis and also gave me a script for all the bloodwork he wants drawn.  I take the script to my chemo center for my chemo nurses to draw since they are well familiar with my arm. I will also be combining his blood tests with some other blood draws I have scheduled, so I can reduce the number of sticks. All in all it was a productive session with my primary doc.  I felt like I was talking 100 miles a minute though trying to cover alot of ground in a short period of time.  I warned him not to think I was Manic....    I obviously chose to take some calculated risks with my BP but I feel the payoff in return is keeping the communication pathways open and preserving a good working relationship with my doc. One of the difficult issues with trying to convey concerns about needle sticks and BPs in an at risk limb is there is inadequate research available on the subject.  I find that doctors will pay much more attention when there is legitimate study data showing the direct correlation between certain causes and effects. I think I may just start stopping off at his office from time to time and leaving more informational materials on LE as I find them. Who knows....maybe he will start sharing the info with his peers also.  One doc a a time.........we can do it!   Life is not measured by how many breaths we take...but by the moments that take our breath away! ...I am a 14/9 yr survivor of 2 Primary BCs, 23/23 Positive Nodes (Zometa x 5 years) Started Paloma-3 Clinical Trial 4-14-14 Dx 7/14/2000, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 1, 2/7 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 8/10/2000 Lumpectomy: Right; Lymph node removal: Right, Sentinel Chemotherapy 8/29/2000 AC + T (Taxol) Radiation Therapy 2/25/2001 Breast, Lymph nodes Hormonal Therapy 5/9/2001 Dx 11/21/2005, ILC, 5cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 1, 23/23 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Surgery 12/4/2005 Lymph node removal: Left, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left, Right Chemotherapy 12/22/2005 Taxotere (docetaxel), Xeloda (capecitabine) Hormonal Therapy 4/6/2006 Aromasin (exemestane) Radiation Therapy 4/6/2006 Breast, Lymph nodes Dx 3/21/2014, ILC, Stage IV, mets, ER+/PR-, HER2- Hormonal Therapy 4/13/2014 Faslodex (fulvestrant) Log in to post a reply",

A wrist BP cuff cannot guarantee we won't get LE just as practicing good skin care, doing gentle exercises and protecting our arms from airline travel by wearing prophylactic compression garments cannot guarantee we won't get LE.  But that is why they are called risk reduction practices. We take all the steps we can do reasonably to push the odds in our favor. I happen to believe the wrist cuff to be a lesser evil than a full upper arm cuff.  Some people feel any BP in the at risk arm at all is too much risk to take and insist on thigh cuff BPs.  You have to do what you feel is the right choice for you. Bilateral mastectomy, bilateral nodal removal, any type of lymphatic system damage can put you at risk for LE.  So yes even though you currently have LE on your left you are also at risk on your right due to the bilateral surgery.  Generally speaking, LE will remain contained within the quadrant that the lymphatic damage has occured in, but if both quadrants have had surgery of the lymphatics the risk is there.  Statistically the risk increases based on the degree of surgery and number of nodes removed, however.  Just didn't want anyone to get the impression that a wrist cuff can \"prevent\" LE, it is only a risk reduction practice.  ",

Good skin care, use of antiseptic and antibiotic ointment, not allowing prolonged compression with blood drawing tourniquets, overinflated BP cuffs, or poorly trained staff to work on us is still paramount.  I spend a great deal of effort coordinating necessary bloodwork between my various doctors so that one stick will accomplish multiple requests for labs.  I also allow my chemo nurses to start my heplock used by the radiology department for all scans requiring contrast media.  These may seem small steps but reducing the frequency of having to use the at risk arm and making sure only the \"experts\" handle those needs seems a worthwhile effort to me. Binney I am very interested in hearing what news you have regarding bioimpedence results being unreliable.  I am aware that it is not effective in patients with bilateral involvement and also has not yet been formally approved for lower limb tracking.  My former LE therapist who moved to KC (and has recently moved back!) had been working with a surgical center to provide presurgical LE evaluation, education and baseline measurements using the L-Dex bioimpedence unit.  She has been very excited about the program but I am not aware that there may be a reliability factor. That would certainly be a disappointment, but may still be better than nothing for trying to detect early stage LE.  Has there been recent research articles on the subject?",

These drugs can cause an inflammatory response particularly in the hands, resulting in pain, redness, stiffness and swelling. I have been on Aromasin now for almost 2 years, but during the first 6 mos to 1 year my hands were in horrible shape with trigger fingers, pain, stiffness in both my LE hand and my Non-LE hand. Fortunately over time the acute inflammation has gone away but I am still left with stiffness and trigger fingers in my Non-LE hand. It's hard to determine if the stiffness I have in my LE hand is from the LE only or some combination of medication side effect also. I will say that during the time my LE was at its peak of swelling and fibrosis, I did have radiating nerve pain into my hand, thumb and little finger in particular. This was very specific sharp shooting pains that were apparently due to nerve compression from the LE swelling. I am not sure why you are having both hands effected though unless it is something systemic... either an inflammatory response to a medication or possibly arthritis. You say they turn red when the pain gets severe... do they also feel warm to touch at that time? Swelling, pain, redness and warmth of the joints could indicate a rheumatoid type condition. Strictly LE should not affect your Non-LE hand also. Let us know what you find out. :)",

      "Content": "Aug 15, 2008 03:08AM - edited Aug 15, 2008 03:13AM by LindaLou53 Thanks for this info Rolniak! I remember reading about reverse mapping last year and will be interested to hear how further study results turn out. It looks like the study is currently following women for 1 year post surgery. I hope they will actually keep track of them longer than that since LE can occur many years later. It may be that they feel any occurence longer than 1 year could possibly be associated with other factors than surgery, however it would be hard to know for sure. Here is a Medscape article about the study:(I have bolded some statistics of interest) New Procedure Eases Lymphedema After Breast Cancer Therapy Allison Gandey Information from Industry March 30, 2007 - A promising new surgical technique appears to spare most women the painful arm swelling that many say is worse than mastectomy. The procedure, dubbed axillary reverse mapping (ARM), was developed to prevent lymphedema caused by faulty drainage of the lymph nodes, one of the most common adverse effects of breast cancer treatment. Senior author Suzanne Klimberg, MD, from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, in Little Rock, says her group is the first to study lymph node drainage in the arm and the procedure they developed has proven so effective it is already being used as standard practice at her center. \"The most important implication - and the thing I would like clinicians to take away from this study - is that one can identify and protect the lymph vessels draining the arm,\" Dr. Klimberg told Medscape. Led by Margaret Thompson, MD, also from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the group describes their experience in a paper scheduled to be published online in the Annals of Surgical Oncology. The work was funded by the Tenenbaum Breast Cancer Research Foundation and presented earlier this month at the Society of Surgical Oncology 60th Annual Cancer Symposium in Washington. Anywhere from 5% to 50% of women undergoing surgical treatment for breast cancer develop lymphedema - a range that tends to depend on the extent of surgery. \"The removal and analysis of the lymph nodes under the arm remains the most important factor in determining the severity of disease in breast cancer patients,\" Dr. Klimberg explained in a news release. \"In the past, surgery to remove the lymph nodes and most of the fat and tissue in the armpit often resulted in complications including lymphedema.\" To prevent swelling, the new ARM procedure evaluates the ways in which fluid drains through the lymph node system using an injectable blue dye. \"Mapping the drainage of the arm decreases the chances of unintended disruption of the lymph node system during surgery and reduces the risk of developing swelling in the arm,\" Dr. Klimberg noted. More Work to Be Done to Confirm Benefit The surgeons point out in their paper that success of this technique in preventing lymphedema will require ongoing follow-up and studies. \"We currently have a prospective study that will measure arm volume. At present, the longest follow-up is 8 months.\" Of the 40 patients who had surgery for breast cancer in the present analysis, 18 required an axillary lymph node resection. Of these, 14 patients had a sentinel lymph node biopsy with the axillary lymph node resection. The researchers report that none of the patients where the ARM lymphatics were identified and preserved have developed lymphedema. They found that injection anywhere in the arm worked well. The upper, inner areas were chosen simply because they had the most rapid drainage and it also hid the tattoo, which could last anywhere from 1 week to 6 months. \"Prior to our use of the ARM technique, we certainly would have sacrificed a good number of these now-easily-identifiable arm lymphatics, not realizing that they were draining the arm and not the breast,\" they write. \"The main critique for our work is the short follow-up and real lack of evidence that it does prevent lymphedema,\" Dr. Klimberg told Medscape. \"The same critique was true of the sentinel lymph node procedure that, after a recent large trial, turned out to have a 7% incidence of lymphedema.\" She noted, \"Our work actually explains those results, as often the arm lymphatics juxtapose or overlay the breast lymphatic but were nonconcordant.\" She points out that the radioactively hot breast lymphatics were never blue and the blue arm lymphatics were never hot. Dr. Klimberg will soon begin training seminars on the procedure in the United States. The sessions will be sponsored by the global medical device company Ethicon, a branch of Johnson & Johnson. Ann Surg Oncol. 2007. In press. Here is a link to the actual clinical trial going on: http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00572481 I also wonder if the consensus is that by reducing damage or removal to the nodes that drain the arm will you also reduce the frequency of truncal or breast LE? Certainly removal of the nodes draining the breast could still present problems for breast and truncal LE, but preserving the arm draining nodes might lessen the total lymphatic system compromise created by surgery.",

Breast Cancer Action Nova Scotia will be holding a press conference at the Nova Scotia Legislature Building on Thursday November 6, 2008 at 10am. For far too long breast cancer patients have had to bear the burden both of a life altering condition called lymphedema and the financial cost of treating it. We feel our provincial government should be paying for treatment costs for lymphedema that is secondary to breast cancer treatment.

The lymph fluid must be properly directed all the way down to the major drainage areas and not just partially moved out of the arm. It is not at all unusual for lymphedema fluid to collect not only in the arm but also in the breast and side, called truncal lymphedema. It is possible to have the feeling of puffyness or tenderness in areas where the fluid collects. Other causes for the type of pain you are having could be rib pain from radiation.  Ribs can remain very sore and tender for years after rads and it might be that a buildup of lymphedema fluid aggravates that situation.  I am glad you are seeing your Rad doctor Tuesday and hopefully he will be able to rule out any other possible causes for your pain. If there are no other medical reasons for the discomfort in your side after your hand treatments, I would certainly either discuss the possibility of truncal LE with your therapist or else find a new certified therapist who is more tuned in to proper Lymphedema management.",

I was diagnosed with my second breast cancer in 2005 which was on my left side, and had 23 massively positive nodes removed by total axillary dissection.  I spent the first 2 weeks post-op sleeping in a recliner and keeping the cats locked out because of all the drain tubes and fresh surgical site.  But when I did return to the bed, Boo Boo once again came to sleep with me, however, never again did she ever attempt to knead my axilla as she had done prior to the surgery! I know it sounds crazy and of course there is no way to know for sure, but I often wonder if she had detected that something wasn't quite \"right\" in that area of my body??  Little Boo herself went on to develop cancer 3 years later and even had 6 months of chemo which kept the tumor at bay for awhile. Who's to say for sure just what an animal understands or is capable of sensing? ",

Wearing a camisole with a light weight form like the TLC Micro Bead also has the advantage of staying in place because you can tuck the bottom of the camisole inside the waistband of your slacks or skirt.  They don't ride up like a bra does with a light weight form!  I am working now on adapting several of my camis and tank tops to hold the Micro Bead forms.  I'm doing the trial and error method for now but once I get my process refined I will post something with pics.",

I think the concept of an older, more mature pet is very wise and often gives a good home to pets typically overlooked by prospective families.  While I understand the concerns of owning cats when having LE, I hope anyone who truly prefers cats would not rule them out based solely on their LE.  I found all 4 of my pets in 1993. One 6 month old cat was a rescue from a flood in our area, 2 wild kittens were born to a feral mother in the woods behind our house and a beautiful black lab pup I had picked out from a breeders litter.  This was long before I developed LE but my pets have all been long lived and I could never have parted with any of them based on a new dx of LE.  It is just a matter of thinking through your interactions with your pets, reinforcing safe play behavior and taking extra precautions when necessary. My beautiful lab Libby broke her back at the age of 5 and was paralyzed for 3 months before regaining her ability to walk. In her later years her inability to walk returned and for the last 1.5 years of her life I had to lift her in and out of her little red wagon we used to take her for walks thru the neighborhood or make a visit to the vet. This was all after my LE dx and it was a matter of finding the right assistive devices and proper body mechanics for me to safely transport her. Libby weighed 95lbs at her peak and 80lbs before she passed in 2008 just 3 months shy of her 15th birthday.  Libby in her wagon sitting with my husband outdoors enjoying the Fall weather.  While my 3 cats were all over 13 years old when I developed LE and long past the playful biting-attacking stage of kittens, I fully expect to have more cats after my remaining cat passes.  Cream Puff passed at 14 years old from liver failure and Boo Boo at 16 from bladder cancer.  My remaining cat, Socks, just had her 19th birthday and shows signs she may very well make 20 next year. I have not had major concerns about taking care of my cats after my LE dx. I did make sure I practiced good protective skin care, and wore protective garments in the rare situation where one of the cats would be stressed out when transporting to the vet and might display panic behavior.  Cream Puff:  Boo Boo:  Socks (19 and still going):   Aggressive or fear response behavior is possible with almost any type of pet. Attack type play is often a learned behavior, made worse when encouraged.  While there may always be an element of risk for a LE patient who chooses to be a pet owner, that is one thing I refuse to let Cancer and LE take away from me. Crystal, good luck in finding the pet that is right for you and your husband. I hope you have many happy years enjoying the love and affection of your new furbaby!",

I am not aware of any studies showing that massaging the arm causes lymphatic regrowth. If you are, please share.  I do know there is current research into achieving regeneration of lymphatic structures in animals that is very encouraging. We also know that properly performed MLD prepares the body to accept the excess fluid which must be moved from the damaged lymphatic area to an area of the body that is still functional and can process that fluid back into the circulatory system.  More to the point of my post however, is we welcome all ideas and input here on this forum, but I have to admit I am a little shocked at your sharp and uncalled for response to Kira's post.  Expressing your feelings that using laymen's terms may be more easily understood is one thing, but the rude overtones of your response immediately damages your credibility as a well-intended contributor to this forum.

The app currently has over 900 LANA certified Lymphedema therapists listed and more will be added as therapists opt to add their contact info. The app became publicly available on Sept 10 and is a free download from the iTunes App store. A formal description of the app with print screens and a link to the App Store can be found on the developers website at: http://hydrogensoftware.com/products.php?id=9 The developers wish to reach out to the Lymphedema community for feedback. They would like input regarding any of the following areas: User friendliness Content Completeness Functionality Technical Issues  Additional features desired for new versions I was asked to do a beta review of the app and got permission to also invite our lymphedema community here at BC.org to lend their feedback. There is a brief online survey consisting of 10 questions with the ability to leave comments as you desire.  The survey link is not currently publicly available, but I will provide it to anyone with a compatible device who is willing to complete the survey after testing out the app. Just PM me if you wish to participate in the survey.  For anyone who prefers to use the app but not go through the formal survey process, I would still be interested in hearing your comments and first impressions.  Feel free to PM me with any issues or suggestions and I will see that they get forwarded to the development team. I am always excited to see LE getting attention in any form and being added to the world of digital mobile apps is a good thing.  Let's give the developers honest critique and suggestions for what we would like to see in a \"find a LE therapist\" mobile application!

Hopefully, more therapists will be added to the work force as training courses continue to be held by the main LE certification schools.  I will be at a PT school next Friday to assist in their clinical labs which are part of their 2 day LE curriculum.  We already have one student who has expressed interest in specializing in LE therapy when she graduates.  She has asked to attend our monthly LE support group.  We always encourage LE therapists to attend the support groups. They can learn so much from the patients!  One of our support group members, who drives 100+ miles roundtrip from another state to attend our meetings, has just found a sponsor in his state willing to start their own LE support group.  I presented at their first meeting last month.  Its a slow process but little by little LE awareness is improving.",

This is a very unique site that will provide a service I don't think is currently available anywhere else. Steve is very intent on opening up the Lymphedema community to networking, interacting, troubleshooting real life problems, discussing current lymphedema vendor products and providing a platform also for socializing and making friends within the lymphedema community. The site has been designed very similarly to Facebook where you can join various groups of interest, invite friends, start your own blogs, and even create your own private or open groups. I find it exciting to know that some of the leading Lymphedema therapists in the country will be participating and lending their expertise and time to help answer both private messages and group discussion threads with specific questions about LE management. This will also be a platform for therapists to network with each other, to gain much needed support and the knowledge that they are not \"the only ones out there\" dealing with the multitude of patient lymphedema issues. It will be a great place for patients to vocalize the patient perspective, start their own discussions, share their experience and unique solutions to problems that may also be helpful for therapists and other patients. I know that Steve is encouraging anyone who has any involvement or personal interest in Lymphedema to take a look at the site. Please consider joining and becoming a part of a very exciting new community network. The community is already growing by leaps and bounds and has unlimited potential for benefitting the Lymphdema Community at large.  I think you will see familiar names/faces from both here, lymphland.com, StepUp-SpeakOut, the NLN and many other lymphedema focused sites.  It is great that each of these sites offers their own unique service and we can all contribute to the lymphedema community in a variety of ways, which ultimately benefits us all!

      "Content": "Aug 13, 2010 03:10AM - edited Aug 13, 2010 03:12AM by LindaLou53 Hi Kcshreve, I don't use my LE arm for BPs for a couple of reasons.  One being that I am not sure if the reading would be as accurate on the LE arm.   The wrist cuff measures BP by detecting the arterial pulse in the wrist.  With the increased extracellular fluid caused by LE and swelling in that area I don't know what effect that might have on getting an accurate BP.  I have tried searching for articles on the accuracy of BPs taken on an arm with active lymphedema but have not yet been able to find one.  All articles advise not taking BPs on an arm with lymphedema. The other reason is that I believe the risk of BP causing worsening LE symptoms and possible cellulitis in an arm with active lymphedema is greater than the risk of developing new onset lymphedema in an at risk arm. Because the lymphatic system is divided into quadrants, the risk of cellulits is much greater in the quadrant that is already affected by lymphedema.  The arm with LE already has protein rich lymphatic fluid circulating in the extracellular tissue.  This is why IVs, needle sticks and BPs in an arm with LE are not recommended because any additional trauma, excessive constriction or introduction of bacteria can rapidly develop into increased swelling, inflammation and serious infection.  An at risk arm by definition does not have the protein rich lymph fluid circulating in the extracellular tissues thus is at lower risk than a lymphedema arm for inflammation and infection. Taking a BP in an at risk arm certainly MAY contribute to the development of active lymphedema in that arm, however, there are no studies that we can refer to which will give us solid statistical percentages to define that level of risk.  So much of what we know about lymphedema is anecdotal or presumed risk / causal relationships.  That's not to say this is not valuable information but it is very hard to quantify the degree of risk involved in specific behaviors. My perception is that taking BP in an at risk arm instead of the arm with active LE, is the lesser of two evils.  It would be so much easier to make these types of decisions if there were clinical studies that could clearly point out the highest statistical risks associated with the various BP options but to my knowledge they don't exist. Regarding your upcoming surgery and necessity for having automatic ankle cuff BPs during the procedure I think that is very commonplace in most OR suites.  OR and ER staff are usually very adept at taking BPs in legs and have the appropriate equipment and training to do so safely.  I agree that leg BPs can be very uncomfortable when you are awake and would certainly discuss this with your surgical staff to see what options are available to you. I have found doctors offices to be more open to allowing use of your personal wrist BP cuff than Inpatient or Outpatient surgical centers are. They will generally use only their own equipment but usually are willing to work with you regarding taking leg BPs manually vs automatic or lowering the pressure settings as needed for your comfort level. I use my wrist cuff at home not because I have hypertension but because I actually have low blood pressure and frequent episodes of postural hypotension.  I do not take daily pressures but will check my pressure when I experience symptoms of hypotension and keep a running record for my primary MD. Otherwise I see a doctor of one sort or another every 3 months and take my own cuff with me to those appointments.  At the cancer center I don't have to worry about it since they routinely use the wrist cuffs for all office appointments. Hope this is helpful.  I wish I could give you a sound and fact based answer to your questions but unfortunately all I have is my personal opinion and interpretation of what little I know about lymphedema and physiology.  I have come to terms with the fact that I am unable to be totally protected against all possibilities and thus have to do the best I can making informed decisions.  I prefer not to be overwhelmed worrying about the \"what ifs\" and am not willing to subject myself to blame for decisions made in good judgement at the time, even if someday those choices have undesireable results.",

My first clue was the beginning of an itch underneath my garments in my forearm area.  I didn't realize I had been bitten until I pulled the garments off and saw the inflammatory response created by the bite with a huge welt in the center:  I washed the area with cool water, antibacterial soap, a little alcohol wipe and then applied an ice cube wrapped in a wet wash cloth.  I kept the ice on for about 15-20 min which really helped to take the itching down.  I felt cold would be better at slowing down the histamine response and decreasing the inflammation.  Here is what the bite looked like after 20 min of cold application:   I applied some neosporin ointment and kept my garments off until after my shower an hour later.  This is what the bite looked like after an hour.  The inflammation was almost totally resolved and no more itching!  My experience is that any bite, cut, burn or injury to my LE arm is always more inflammatory or reactive than it would normally be in my non-LE arm.  In this specific instance of a single mosquito bite, I believe the initial redness, swelling, itching etc. to be a result of the histamine response which thankfully is usually of short duration.  I would not start to worry about a mosquito bite unless the redness persisted along with onset of increasing heat and pain.  I suspect our damaged lymph systems may be able to withstand a single bite without too much difficulty, but multiple bites with extensive inflammation to a larger portion of the limb may result in volume increases and sustained flairs of LE, along with increased risk of infection setting in. We still have to always be concerned with ANY break in skin that might allow bacteria to enter, so always clean the area immediately, disinfect with appropriate alcohol type wash and apply an antibiotic ointment.  I really hate not being able to enjoy the warm, summer evenings outside but do try to avoid getting any bites at all.  I will have to give some of the products mentioned here in this thread a try!  I would love to feel more confident visiting my father who lives on a farm in a rural area that is full of ticks, spiders, mosquitos etc...and many of those make their way into the 100+ year old farmhouse.  Hard to explain to other people why I decline camping trips, river rafting, fishing and other outdoor activities which put me a little \"too close\"  to dear old Mother Nature!",

      "Content": "Jul 30, 2009 12:33PM - edited Sep 8, 2009 05:12AM by LindaLou53 Hi NativeMainer, Thanks for your informative reply!  Its been 31 years since I was in nursing school and I know technology has certainly changed for the better.  We had no automatic BP devices while I was in training, but we were trained to take BPs in the upper arm and thigh.  From the little research I have done recently it seems that getting an accurate BP measurement is dependent on very many variables and is actually the most difficult vital sign measurement to obtain consistent accurate results on. These variables include body positioning, cuff positioning, cuff size, level of cuff in relation to the heart, too rapid deflation of the cuff, the white coat effect, whether or not BP is taken after at least a 5 min rest period and not while asking patient to answer questions at the same time,  taken at least one hour after ingestion of caffeine,  smoking or exercise, and the hearing acuity of the person taking the pressure in the case of manual BP. The informative value of a BP is really more in showing a trend than the actual readings at any given point other than in the case of an extremely high or low systolic or diastolic value. The point you bring up about reports of injury and blood clots related to automatic BP machines is a very pertinent one, especially to the breast cancer community.  Many cancer patients will be on medications which predispose them to blood clots for several years. Unfortunately, I believe for most surgical procedures requiring IV sedation or general anesthesia, automatic BP machines are routinely used.  In the case of women with bilateral nodal involvement who would require thigh or calf BPs during a procedure, this combination makes me very nervous.  The worry about the development or aggravation of existing DVT from a BP cuff on the leg, even a manual cuff is of great concern in my mind. There obviously needs to be a great deal more study on the least harmful and most accurate ways to obtain BP readings. As wonderful as the current level of training in nursing schools is, what I am seeing in actual practice in a variety of health care environments is less than ideal.  I happen to go to an extremely busy chemo center that has at least 20 recliner chairs occupied by chemo patients on any given day.  They utilize wrist BP cuffs primarily for the fact that in most cases the patient will have an \"affected\" arm which cannot be tested for BP and the other arm which will have an IV line of some sort and is not conducive to using a full upper arm cuff.  There is certainly a percentage of patients like myself there also who will have bilateral involvement, whether it was a prophylactic mastectomy on one side and no nodes removed, or nodal removal on both sides. I have yet to see anyone receive a thigh or calf BP in the setting of the chemo room.  There are 2 rooms in the chemo center that have regular hospital beds.  Usually the sickest or most physically compromised patients use those rooms.  Otherwise there is no ability to have a patient lie flat to obtain a thigh BP (recliners only lean back to a small degree). If you consider the fact that for some IV chemo routines like Adriamycin and Taxol it is necessary to take more than one BP throughout the administration process, that only adds to the issue of how to provide for accurate thigh or calf BPs in a practical sense. I know there will be ongoing debate on this issue and I welcome all points of view and literature sources that can help us truly be informed to make our best decisions.  I have found limited studies on the accuracy of using wrist BP cuffs compared to the standard upper arm cuffs.  The most recent studies, however, indicate that wrist BP cuffs have been found to be as accurate as standard manual sphygmomanometer cuffs and also the digital oscillometric devices.  One feature of a wrist BP cuff which should be absolutely present is a position sensor that will not allow the BP reading to take place until the arm is placed in the correct position at heart level.  This eliminates one of the biggest reasons for inaccurate readings.  Certainly for individuals needing to self monitor their BP at home for already exisitng hypertension, the wrist BP cuffs have become the device of choice. While I have no research to back up my opinion, my gut instinct tells me that the risk of precipitating a DVT with a wrist BP cuff is much less than that of a thigh or calf BP cuff. I choose to avoid leg BP readings primarily for this reason and also because I understand that the current level of expertise in taking accurate and safe leg BP readings is lacking in many of the real world clinical settings. Many drs offices or walk-in clinics don't even have the correct cuff sizes to use and staff have not been trained for a proper thigh BP measurement.  I prefer to have my medication and treatment choices based on an accurate wrist BP reading rather than an inappropriate response to a misunderstood or poorly taken leg BP reading. I also still feel that utiliizing a wrist BP cuff, while not totally eliminating the risk of LE, does significantly lower the risk compared to using standard upper arm cuffs for BP.  I will restate again...this is MY choice...MY understanding of the calculated risk for my developing LE as a result...but it also is a choice that I feel weighs in the balance the multitude of factors that we must consider when attempting to protect our overall health.  As much as we want to avoid LE there are other serious health issues we need to be concerned about preventing also.  Until more comprehensive research data is available as to the actual cause and effect of all these issues, we must make our best personal choice. I certainly don't want to bias or mislead anyone, but I think we need to keep an open perspective on the full spectrum of options available to us.",

The microbeads are the trickiest part about making the breast forms and will easily drive you nuts as they float all over your work area.  I suggest trying to fill the fabric covers outside.  Leave as small an opening as possible to fill the beads so you can contain them better and have less whipstitching to do after the covers are full of microbeads.  Also make sure the fabric covers are a tight weave and won't let the tiny beads push out.

Below is a very detailed medical article studying NON-INVASIVE continuous monitoring of BP (mean blood pressure), HR (heart rate), CO (cardiac output), and SV (cardiac stroke volume).  The Nexfin finger cuff system referred to in this study is currently designed for professional use in diagnostic, outpatient, inpatient and acute care settings.  If this technology becomes more widely available and accepted for its accuracy, I suspect it may ultimately be followed by a more compact and portable consumer based product.

      "Content": "Jan 5, 2011 01:27PM - edited Jan 5, 2011 01:48PM by LindaLou53 Yes, we are all anatomically unique and our number of nodes will vary based on that uniqueness in addition to the degree of surgical removal the surgeon opts to use. Here is a fairly comprehensive article on Axillary Lymph Nodes found on the Ganfyd site which is similar to Wikipedia but is specifically a free medical knowledge base and collaborative medical reference by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts. www.ganfyd.org/index.php?title... The interesting point is that from a strictly anatomical classification they list 6 separate classifications of axillary nodes.  From the surgical viewpoint as it relates to breast cancer surgery, however, they define nodal locations by the term \"station\"  or  \"level\" of nodes.  So surgically they refer to 3 levels of axillary nodes.  Most Sentinel Node biopsies include just those nodes that light up first from the injected dye and possibly any surrounding or suspicious looking nodes in that area.  Typically a sentinel node will be in the Level 1 area of the axilla but not always....again we are all different and the pattern of lymphatic flow will vary in individuals. In recent years the term \"axillary dissection\"  is vaguely defined to mean the removal of level 1 and 2 nodes or even just level 1 nodes.  It is really up to the discretion of the surgeon.  Level 3 nodes typically are not removed unless there is known pathology and evidence of very locally advanced disease. We must remember that our entire bodies are covered by lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes.  Axillary nodes are only one component of our entire lymphatic system.  Even in the case of breast cancer, we have nodes that are considered surgically inoperable because of their location.  These would include the intramammary nodes that can be very near or underneath the breast bone making biopsy and removal difficult if not impossible. So when it comes to the difference in the nodal counts that we hear reported it can be a factor of how many levels of nodes were removed in addition to the normal anatomical variations between each of us. I had 23 nodes removed which included my level 3 nodes.  All 23 were found to be positive so my onc and I made the assumption than any nodes left behind were also positive. We have been aggressive in treatments though and are thrilled to be past my 5 year mark still NED!  Just remember ladies that positive nodes means a well functioning lymphatic and immune system doing its job, capturing and imprisoning those cancer cells that are trying to move out of the breast area.  I know we would all rather not have any nodes positive.....but we also know 0 nodes is no quarantee that cancer cannot still spread in other ways.  We have heard the story too often of Stage 1 ladies with 0 nodes ending up Stage IV. I say hurray for a strong lymphatic system and know that our future prognosis is not always \"told by the nodes\". Hang in there ladies! ",

As others have mentioned, I found that my right Non-LE but at risk arm was more stimulated than usual with new sensations but that could be just the initial adjustment to wearing a garment.  I did not have any achyness or irritation noted on the right arm while wearing the SilverWave like I did when wearing the first ArmCare sleeve I tried. Because my current project is determining whether the Class II ArmCare sleeve can provide adequate compression, I stopped wearing the SilverWave for now and am strictly wearing the ArmCare during the day, sometimes alternating days with my regular Mediven sleeve.  I always wear my Medi glove no matter which sleeve I am wearing.  I am keeping track of circumference measurements twice a day at 6 points on each arm.  3 points below the elbow and 3 points above.  Now that I have replaced my original ArmCare sleeve with the non-defective black original version, I have been tracking my measurements for 9 days straight. I know Sue Callison was in Italy a week ago and hopefully she will have some news soon regarding garment revisions and future plans for expanding garment selections.  I will let both her and all of you know the results of my little experiment with the ArmCare Sleeve as soon as I feel I have enough data to share my opinion.  ",

I have no regrets at all for doing everything possible to kill this cancer. The surgery is very doable and not having reconstruction was one of the best decisions I made in this whole process.  Be sure to check out the BreastFree website for helpful information for both pre and post operative issues.  Tons of good information about your choices of going flat, wearing prosthesis, clothing choices and general adaptation to an unreconstructed chest. Best wishes and prayers are coming your way!  You can do this!",

(I'm a visual kind of person! ) 1.  The bra is of a very soft and stretchy 88% Nylon 12% Spandex knit.  2.  There are no rigid seams or bands 3.  There are no back clasps or hooks.  It is designed like a Sports bra that you have to pull on over your head and or step into like a swimsuit. 4.  It comes with small pads in the bra pockets that could be used as \"enhancers\" for someone with a lumpectomy or as additional padding with a prosthesis, or just removed completely.  I removed the pads in order to get my microbead forms to fit.  Being one size fits all, the bra cups are on the small side but are very stretchy.  I had to enlarge the opening into the bra pocket to insert my Sz 8 and Sz 7 forms more easily but once seated properly, the bra holds them firmly in place, no shifting around. 5.  The straps are very skinny, but soft and stretchy with adjustments in the front.  They can be completely removed and the bra comes with a set of clear transparent straps also. 6.  The band at the bottom of the bra is about 1 inch wide, soft, stretchy but fits snug enough that the bra does not ride up even with the lightweight forms.  I used to wear a 38C bra and this is not too tight on me, snug but not binding. 7.  The sides and back of the bra are all one piece of fabric, smooth and high cut so it fits high under the arms and also on the back. 8.  The neckline actually fits pretty snug to the chest and does not do much gapping to reveal scars or prosthesis.  Black colored bras tend to make gaps less noticeable though since it looks like a shadow instead of fabric showing under clothes. I was initially concerned that the bra pockets were too small for my forms but after getting them properly seated, the forms provide a decent projection in the profile view. My feelings are that this is certainly a bra worth trying.  It is NOT an expensive heavily constructed bra but that is why it is light, stretchy and comfortable.  If someone needs full support for an existing breast or heavy silicone forms I would be less enthusiastic that this is the bra for you.  This bra really provides no support as such.  It is more like going without a bra and just wearing a light stretchy tube top or sports bra without the added support.  BUT, for someone who is small busted or has had bilateral mx and wants to wear lightweight forms I think it is definitely worth looking into it. There will be some persons for whom the \"one size fits all\"  just won't work, but within the size range the bra is advertised at I think most people will find it comfortable. I plan on wearing mine for a few days and see if my opinion changes.  For now, I am more favorably impressed than I was expecting to be.  I still feel that this bra may not hold up as well as the heavier ones but it also is not as expensive as standard mastectomy bras.  It definitely has the comfort factor working for it over a heavy duty mastectomy bra. www.shopcoobie.com/ Here are some pics: Front of the Coobie Bra with the small cup pads removed:   Coobie Bra Back turned Inside Out:  Coobie Bra Cup Pocket:  Coobie Bra Profile and Neckline:   Coobie Bra Profile in Clothes:  Coobie Bra Front in Clothes: ",

I just wanted to mention in case anyone else is considering these bras, that I found an Ebay seller who sells the Coobie bras at a discounted price ($6.99 each vs $20 each on the Coobie site).  I ordered the bras to see if they are the same as the one I ordered from the official Coobie site and they do appear to be the same bra with some minor differences.  The printing on the inside back band of the Ebay bras reports the fabric as 90% Nylon and 10% Spandex however both fabrics feel identical to me.  The style, shape and size of the bras is the same but the Ebay bra lists the style # as 6017 and the Coobie bra is # 9012.  Both are labeled as made in China.  One other minor difference is the Ebay bras have the straps attached with the adjustment side in the back instead of the front of the bra.  This is completely changeable though since the straps can be removed and attached so that the adjustment is in front. I ordered 3 of the Ebay Coobie bras and including shipping/handling the total was $30.97 which is quite a savings over the $20 Coobie bras.  With this particular Ebay seller the shipping for the first bra is $5.50 but each additional bra is $2.50. (at least to my midwest zipcode...it may be different in other areas of the US.) Here is the link to the Ebay listing if anyone is interested: http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-COOBIE-FREE-SIZE-SEAMLESS-BRAS-WHITE-BLACK-BEIGE-/120596953941?cmd=ViewItem&pt=US_CSA_WC_Intimates&var=&hash=item61ca584df7",

Thanks again for the new link and hope you like your Coobies! P.S. just a note to say this seller is also selling some different style Coobie brand bras that might be interesting to some of you.  She is selling a 6 bra set of multiple color bras with lace trim at this link: cgi.ebay.com/Set-6-seamless-br... She also is selling some Coobie sports bras with the racer style back in multiple colors at this link: cgi.ebay.com/Set-6-seamless-sp... I'm not sure if the sports bras have the removable pads or not but it looks like they might.  The multicolor lace trimmed bras do have removable pads and look very similar in style to the basic Coobie bra.

The Zee Bra definitely looks like it follows similar concepts to the Coobie....just designed specifically for the smaller body types.  I wish they had larger pictures to see more closely the actual bra construction.  In their description of the removeable pads it sounds like they are the rounded shape on top and square bottoms so that is a variance from the triangle shape Coobie uses.  Let us know if you get one and take some more pics to show us! Regarding sewing classes...its never too late to learn!  Depending on the degree of your interest there are tons of classes you can take. Basic sewing skills, specific craft projects, classes with specific types of sewing machines, sergers and embroidery machines.  It can get very complicated...Lol!  You can also use the many sewing book resources and online instruction videos.  Believe it or not, I have found some of my cutest patterns and instructions on YouTube videos!  If you go to YouTube and just enter a few search phrases you will find tons of informative, visual help.  Sometimes you have to be selective about which videos to follow based on the presenter's experience (or lack of) but in general you can find countless simple and more advanced projects to try at home using the video instructions. Here is a link to a basic sewing tutorial I just now found doing a search.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVP-pfjdyeE It looks like this person is fairly easy to understand and thorough in her presentations.  Her YouTube name is thecraftygemini and you can search just on her name to get a full listing of all her tutorials.",

It is very important that if you start to get any redness, pain or swelling in your hands/feet that you notify your onc right away.  Don't be a hero and try to tough it out.  Dosage adjustment can make a big difference in reducing the inflammation and possibly prevent more serious complications. Regarding the Vit B6....it is actually recommended by many oncs for patients on Xeloda to also take at least 200 - 400mg of Vit B6 every day.  Theory is it may help protect the nervous system and reduce onset of hand/foot. Xeloda is a very effective chemo drug that can produce dramatic improvement in tumor markers and mass size.  My onc also had me take 500mg Xeloda every single day of my radiation treatments because it is supposed to help sensitize the tumors for better response to radiation. I never really had any other major side effects like nausea or diarrhea with the Xeloda....just the hand/foot and that got better when I switched to 7days on/ 7 days off.",

I still like my Coobies bras very much but again feel strongly they will not be as suitable for women with heavy silicone prosthesis or single mastectomy due to the matchup problem with both sides.  For BMX women who wear lightweight forms they seem to work better.  I suspect there are a wide variety of very similar bras in the same fabric and style, but you would have to trial each one to know for sure how they will feel and fit when wearing.

I really am having a ton of fun with the new Coobie bras and lightweight microbead forms. I just experimented yesterday with laundring a Coobie bra with the microbead forms still in the pockets.  I threw them in cold water on the gentle cycle and then gentle fluff dry for about 30 minutes.  They came out great!  The microbead forms still felt slightly damp but were plumped up and not damaged in anyway I could tell.  I just let them air dry in the sunshine the rest of the way.  The Coobie bra helped protect the forms and it saved me the trouble of having to remove and re-insert the forms each time.  I did remove the little elastic straps on the bras though before throwing them in the wash.  I was afraid they might be a tangled mess if I didn't.  You could also throw the bras and forms in a regular netted laundry bag too to keep them separate from the rest of the laundry. Patty:  So glad you found the Coobies now before your surgery!  That will give you a nice option for the tender healing period when you wouldn't want anything heavy on your chest anyway.  Be sure to check out the TLC lightweight microbead forms to use with the bras.  There are many of us now wearing some version of those forms and loving them even years out after surgery! Best wishes for your upcoming surgery and be sure to let us know how you are doing.",

But I think you can take enough precautions to combat the heat without wearing a \"quickie\" sleeve that might do more harm than good in the long run. I say you should plan on having FUN at the games, but at the same time plan ahead to keep the odds in your favor for decreasing your LE risk. Its definitely a good thing that your seats will be in the shade.  As you already know, hydrate well before, during and after the game.  Be sure to wear lots of sunscreen with a high SPF.  Wear light, loose fitting clothing that lets the air in. Avoid carrying heavy purses or beverage coolers. Consider bringing a portable fan or one of those cool mist sprayers you can use to keep cool. Remember to get up and walk around from time to time.  Don't sit in one place for more than an hour without taking a short stretch break. If in spite of your best plans, you find yourself truly overheated and uncomfortable, get up and find an airconditioned spot where you can really cool off. Remember the bug spray and take your emergency kit of alcohol wash, triple antibiotic ointment and bandaids in the event of any cuts or bites.  When you get home that evening, take it easy, elevate your arms and relax.  If you know how to do a simple MLD massage it never hurts to help clear the nodal areas and keep the lymph fluid moving in the right direction. But by all means...HAVE FUN!  Don't let the worry of possibly getting LE prevent you from enjoying the things you really like to do with family and friends.  Just think ahead and be prepared....then have a great time! ",

Surgeons often use their discretion to remove nodes they feel appear suspicous either visually or by manual inspection in addition to the sentinel nodes that takeup the dye.  The risk for LE is generally higher the more nodes removed, but there are women who have numerous nodes removed and never develop LE while some with 1-2 nodes removed still develop LE.  The fact is that we have many lymph nodes throughout our entire bodies. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) estimates the number of lymph nodes in the human body is between 500 and 700.  Our nodes are connected by lymphatic vessels, similar to blood vessels that move fluid from one area to another.  There are numerous lymph nodes in and around the breast area, not just in the axilla (armpit).  There are 3 levels of axillary nodes but the number of axillary nodes varies between individuals.  There are nodes in the breasts along the sternum, near the chest wall and at the clavical area.  Here is a diagram of nodes in the breast area:  Having a mastectomy will involve removal of lymphatic structures by necessity because as much breast tissue as possible will be removed. The priority for you right now is the successful treatment of your cancer but hopefully you will have minimal nodes removed if possible. Carol gives good advice regarding getting baseline measurements and taking arm precautions. You may want to check out this article on Risk Reduction at the StepUp-SpeakOut website: www.stepup-speakout.org/riskre... Good luck with your upcoming surgery and treatments.  I hope you never have to deal with LE yourself personally, but if you do, this is the place to find the understanding and help you need.",

If you had serious problems with your original chemo regimen I am sure your specialists will carefully tailor a treatment protocol for you that will take that into account.  Hopefully, after diagnostic scans or biopsies this second lump will turn out to be nothing worrisome. I know its terribly hard to face the thought of going through treatment again, but it is still doable and as others have said it is sometimes easier the second time around.  Let us know how it goes.",

I am not sure if they consider two different types of bc found in the same breast at the same time as two primaries or not.  I have had both IDC and ILC, one in each breast but they were detected 5 years apart even though my docs now know the ILC was present when I was being treated for the IDC, it was just never picked up by the standard mammograms. The fact that both your IDC and ILC tumors have the same ER/PR+ and Her2Neu-  status is good because you can benefit from both the chemo and the anti-hormonals.  Was your prophylactic breast clear of bc or were your tumors in different breasts?  It sounds like you are treating this aggressively and you have every reason to be excited about your reconstruction soon being complete. I will only make one comment, not to discourage you but to hopefully keep you from becoming less vigilant regarding your future breast health.  Just as much as we can never blindly accept the statements of a  doctor who tells us we are statistically  \"doomed\" to a recurrence or incurable cancer, we also must not be too willing to accept as truth the statement that we are \"cured\". It would be great if we could know that for a fact, but unfortunately nothing in life is certain. By all means, get on with your life, enjoy your wonderful family and know that you have taken the necessary steps to give yourself the best chance of a long and healthy future.  Just continue to keep  vigilant regarding staying in tune with your body and keeping up with new advancements in breast cancer research which might have a positive impact on you.  You have made it through this last year and have every reason to celebrate!

I did read the article and I stand by what I said.  The article makes a distinction between Therapeutic Lymph Node Dissection (TLND) and Elective Lymph Node Dissection (ELND) of the Regional Lymph Nodes (RLNs).  They do not negate the value of TLND in the presence of active nodal tumor growth. They state in their conclusions that: \"What then are the consequences of tumour metastases developing in the RLNs? When the volume of metastasis is small, the immunological effect generated against the primary tumour can be sufficient to control potentially lethal cells in a dormant state for a long period of time[60,61] and occasionally may result in cell death without further growth or dissemination.[38] Removal of these clinically irrelevant cells would be unnecessary and might even be harmful from an immunological standpoint. Yet, as the tumour grows, eventual immunosuppression is likely to develop through a variety of tumour-induced mechanisms.[62] Eventually, the normal lymph node architecture is destroyed rendering the lymph node immunologically ineffective and a possible source for further tumour dissemination. At this point, once the tumour has become biologically active and has obliterated the normal structure and function of the node, removal would serve to decrease tumour burden and potentially decrease further tumour-based immunosuppression.[38,63-65] \" They also state: \"When no effective adjuvant therapy exists for metastatic disease, close clinical follow-up and TLND at disease recurrence is an acceptable approach in patient management. TLND in this case allows for improved local control and may on occasion even salvage a small number of patients.\"  In reference to their concern about ELND they state that: \"we have demonstrated that no scientific evidence exists to support the routine elective removal of clinically uninvolved lymph nodes in any cancer in an attempt to prolong survival.\" Seems like a pretty obvious statement to me and I have no problem with it.  I agree that the routine removal of healthy uninvolved lymph nodes seems totally unnecessary and harmful.  Regarding the use of SLNB they state: \"in patients who desire more prognostic information SLNB may be a more appropriate intervention. When proven effective adjuvant therapy exists for patients with cancer, SLNB can be used as a staging tool to determine those patients eligible for adjuvant treatment.\" They state: We believe that the reason ELND does not benefit patients with cancer is because the RLNs are not mechanical filters or dams preventing the spread of tumour to the systemic circulation but are instead indicators of the presence of systemic metastasis. For all I know they might be right, but I do not see where there is any evidence that \"clearly shows\" this is the case.  Even if it is true there is nothing in their article to indicate they would not fully support the removal of nodes which were involved with cancer to the point of architectural destruction as mine were.  I am sure the medical community's understanding of the lymphatic system and the full role it plays is far from being either totally accurate or comprehensive. I would never presume that anyone has a corner on understanding all the complexities of the human body.  Hopefully our knowledge will continue to improve and treatments will become more effective and less damaging.  I stand by my earlier statements:  \"I would never go so far as to say that removing cancerous nodes does not have any therapeutic value.\" \"I do not believe that with our current treatment capabilities we can say nodal removal is never of any value.\"  Janeluvsdog I appreciate your point of view and your right to express it.  The only reason I felt the need to post was your statement  \"So removing nodes has no therapeutic value and obsolete staging value.\"    After reading the research article you posted I just don't see how you can make that statement.",

It sure helped to save my good hand from over usage problems. My good hand was developing carpel tunnel, joint pain and trigger fingers due to nightly wrapping with bandages. The Jovi is so much easier, comfortable and does a good job compressing my arm. I do use the outer sleeve jacket to keep the compression at its maximum. The Jovis are machine washable on gentle cycle and I dry it in my dryer with 3 tennis balls to keep it fluffed up. The sleeve jacket I let air dry. One of the reasons I prefer the Jovi to sleeves like the Reid sleeve is because the Jovi gives me enough flexibility of my elbow and hand that I can still do what needs to be done if I get up to the bathroom during the night. Bending the arm and fine motor maneuvering is a little more difficult with the sleeves that have multiple straps with velcro or buckles that must be tightened or released. Jovis are not cheap. If your friend has insurance that covers garments it should not be a problem, but paying out of pocket may be difficult for many. I don't know if Jovi has a price discount for non-insurance purchases but would be worth checking with them if that is an issue. If your friend does decide to try a Jovi or similar night time sleeve, she still needs to get measured by an experienced therapist or DME staff specifically trained in garment fitting so she is assured of a proper fit. If she is like me when I got my first Jovi, she will feel like someone just lifted a huge burden off her shoulders :) Here is a link to the JoviPak website: JoviPak Website",

I received a phone call from Sue today, informing me that she had just been made aware of a production issue with their most recent shipment of the CCL2 ARMCARE SIZE MEDIUM in CAMEL COLOR.  This is currently the only garment in their product line affected by this manufacturing issue in Italy. Sue is right on top of the problem and notifying patients who have recently ordered this specific garment.  She gave me permission to post this just as a \"heads up\" for anyone who may have a  CCL2 ARMCARE SIZE MEDIUM in CAMEL COLOR purchased AFTER JAN 2011.  You may want to email Sue at Sue@LymphedemaSleeveCo.com or give them a call at 1-888-841-8834 if you have this garment. I am totally impressed with Sue's dedication to maintaining the high quality standard of her product and her sincere desire to serve the Lymphedema community the best way she can.  Being a breast cancer survivor and LE patient herself, she really \"gets it\"!",

The trash bag just sits on the floor between the bed and the table.  I think you are right that using a recliner would be difficult since the handle is on the right side. I believe Tactile System's literature indicates it is better for you to be reclining pretty flat so that is why I have just always used the bed for my sessions. I don't wear a truncal garment but I do sleep in a JoviPak night time sleeve and I definitely suffer from sporadic hot flashes.  I found that keeping a remote controlled fan in the bedroom works great.  When the flash starts to strike I turn the fan on full blast.  After I cool down I can turn it lower or shut it off completely without getting out of bed.

Aspen:  I agree it is a good deal worth trying for anyone looking for a very soft, lightweight comfortable solution to wearing lightweight forms.   I'm not sure how many this Ebay vendor has in stock.  I noticed last night that she was out of the color white but hopefully she has a source and will get more stock in.  She still had black and beige as of late last night.",

The ebay seller I ordered from uses super fast shipping plus all the bras were brand new in original packing with their tags attached.  The only difference I saw at all is that these bras have a little silk tag on the back with the fabric content and laundering instructions.  I just used my seam ripper to snip the threads and remove the tag since I prefer the seamless smooth feel.  The tag came off easily without any problem. I think that same ebay seller still has some sets of the polkadot lace trimmed bras.  I noticed she is also selling 4 sets of 5 solid colored bras with matching lace.  They look like they should be the same as the ones I have just no polkadots.  All the sets are very reasonably priced at basically $4 per bra plus shipping.  Certainly worth a try if anyone wants more colors or the lace trim style. That particular Ebay seller is very professional and fast in her sales.",

I can understand in your specific case that a FNA of a suspect node versus surgical removal is a true advantage in accurately diagnosing without further invasive procedure. It sounds like this study, however, is promoting FNA results as the criteria which determines whether or not to do SNB or Total ALND, but does not allow the breast cancer patient to avoid any type of axillary surgery all together. I am curious what their process was in selecting the specific nodes to perform FNA on in this study. All the study participants either went on to have SNB or ALND. Did they select a palpable axillary node to FNA? Did they do FNA on multiple nodes on a single patient based on any objective criteria? I assume if the node selected for FNA was negative for cancer, this would push the patient into the SNB group. If the SNB happened to reveal a positive node, I assume the patient would still then receive a ALND. It is encouraging to hear that the FNA process can be accurate to a degree. I can envision this being very helpful technology when diagnosing newly enlarged lymph nodes ie. supraclavicular, inguinal and axillary when ruling out breast cancer recurrence. It does not sound like they would rely solely on FNA as a means of staging axillary node status in newly diagnosed breast cancer however. I suppose if a patient refused to have either SNB or ALND it would be a method to determine the need for chemo or radiation if there was a positive finding using FNA alone. There will still always be the possibility of sampling error which may not then give accurate results for further treatment decisions. Still, I am glad progress is being made to find less invasive methods of diagnosis and certainly this procedure would be the desired choice in many situations. Thanks for posting this!",

I don't have anything new to add regarding clothing styles best suited for going flat. My style looks for casual comfort first and then I like to play around with color and design details around the neckline / bodice areas. Layers are our friend so I always wear a tank top of some type under another shirt or blouse.  I also have Lymphedema so I wear a full compression sleeve and glove every single day which is a challenging \"fashion statement\", however I long ago decided not to even try to hide it.  I wear sleeveless tank tops in the summer and don't bother covering up with any other shirt when its hot out. I actually had on a new top today which I picked up at Marshalls on clearance.  I love the color and it has just enough neckline detail and soft gathers with an empire waist to be comfortable and flattering.  I'm 6 ft tall so I like tops that are more of a tunic length and roomy enough to camouflage my ample midriff and hips. I decided to post a couple pics here and join in on the discussions. Here is the neckline view of the new top.  I have decided I prefer the look of tops with scoop or V-necks to high neck tops.  Since I always wear a snug fitting tank underneath, I don't worry about too much exposure from a low neckline.  I just try to color coordinate the tanks when I can.  This is a full length body shot showing the top with my crop pants.  I like the way it hangs below my hips but mostly I just enjoy being comfortable! ",

When you wrapped your arm last night did you also wrap your hand and fingers?  Swelling of your hand would certainly be expected if you are not including your hand in the nightly wrapping of your arm.  Wrapping using the short stretch bandages is an art that does not come easily without lots of daily practice even for a trained therapist.  You must have just the right amount of gradient pressure with the highest pressure at your hand and lessening pressure as the wrap moves up your arm.  I suspect every one of us who wrap, have had to remove our bandages in the middle of the night at least once because we wrapped one area too tight and started getting swelling, pain or numbness. I would definitely suggest that you set up an appointment with your LE therapist for a full evaulation of your arm, get a professional MLD session, have her check that your sleeve and glove is properly fitted and get a refresher on wrapping.  The kind of upper arm pain you describe could very well be LE pressure in the arm even if you don't notice any size changes.  Many of us had those kind of achy, throbby pains and sense of heaviness in our LE arms either prior to our diagnosis or for periods after. I am glad you will be following up with your onc for other testing.  If your pain is very acute, unrelenting no matter how you massage, elevate or wrap your arm, I would definitely want to be sure there is not another medical process going on.  Since you describe your pain as being \"very bad\", keeping you awake at night and almost in tears I think you should really get it checked out without assuming it is your LE even though that is the most likely cause. You are not whining!  None of us want to be in pain and you should not have to be any longer than necessary.  Hopefully you will hear something soon about the blood tests and future scans may shed some light on the other physical symptoms you are having, set up that new evaluation appointment with your LE therapist and I hope you can soon get some relief. Please let us know how you are doing.",

Their results as quoted from the actual study abstract: \"RESULTS: The overall contribution of curative and adjuvant cytotoxic chemotherapy to 5-year survival in adults was estimated to be 2.3% in Australia and 2.1% in the USA. \" www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15...  What this study is saying, is that persons in general with any of the 22 studied cancers, have a 2.1 - 2.3% IMPROVEMENT in their 5 year survival rate as a result of taking chemotherapy.  It certainly does NOT say that only 2.1-2.3% of people taking chemotherapy are still alive in 5 years! Gscott, I found the same quote you used, misinterpreted on many other \"natural\" cancer treatment sites. Some are promoting the use of Sodium Bicarbonate (basic Baking Soda) among other things as a total cure for many cancers, some with statements of cures in as little as 6 days! You can find websites that will tout a cure for almost every disease known to man.  Please be very cautious in how you choose to do your research.  There is a good reason why clinical trials and evidence based research is required by the mainstream medical community. You may not choose to accept the gold standard of treatment which has been proven through years of research and countless patient success stories, but please be sure you fully understand what you are reading before you make your decision. Take things one step at a time and get your lump checked out by a reputable breast surgeon.  Hopefully, you will have nothing to worry about but if you do, discuss all your concerns in detail with your medical team.  Have them explain to you the benefit of adding the various types of treatments to your overall outcomes which will be based on your specific type of tumor if you have one. Gscott, I know this is a very scary time for you. I fully understand the fear of the unknown, not knowing if you will have to deal with a cancer and not knowing how you want to treat it if you do. Please, read these boards and see how many, many ladies have successfully treated cancers and go on to live long and active lives. I am a 9 year survivor of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal medications for my first breast cancer in 2000 and almost a 4 year survivor of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and hormonal medications for my second, unrelated breast cancer in 2005.  I truly believe that without these gold standard treatments I would not be here today writing this to you.

These micro bead forms though are light as a feather and do not pull clothing away.  I even found some of the Target camis with the bra pockets and the size 7-8 micro bead forms fit great in the XL camis. While I still plan on going flat most the time, it is great to know I can wear these forms for those special times when I need to fill out my clothing to better advantage.  I am thinking about sewing bra pockets into some of my other camisoles to fit the new micro bead forms.  I'm not crazy about the skinny straps on the Target camis, but I have to admit they are very comfortable. Thanks to Coonie for telling us about these two great finds! P.S.  Sunshine where did you find a supply of micro beads to buy?  Are they the really tiny polyurethane micro beads?  I have seen places selling polystyrene micro beads but they are not the same as what they use in the breast forms.  I too have been thinking about making my own foobies but haven't found a place to buy the right beads.",

Sunshine thanks for the update on the micro beads at Jo-Anns.  I will definitely try them out.  I picked up some very lightweight poly-knit fabric that should work for both bra pockets and also breast form covers.  I was thinking I would use my digital kitchen scale to weigh the microbeads so I could get the same amount each time for each form.  My size 7 form weighs 0.75 ounces and the size 8 weighs 0.85 ounces.  My chest is uneven after the surgery so I need a larger form on the right to look even.  I will let you know if I get a form made.  Won't have time to get the beads and try it til later next week.  Right now I'm sewing pockets in some camis and tank tops!",

October was always the month that both breasts had a mammogram so in Oct 2005 I had the mamms and was given the \"all clear\" for both breasts. 10 minutes later, after the news of good mamms, I saw my surgeon who discovered suspicious thickening in my \"good\" breast. Long story-short, I had a Stage IIIC Invasive Lobular in the good breast with all 23 nodes positive for cancer. Yes, I had a history of dense breasts. There is no question in my mind that if I had received a breast MRI back in 2000 my Lobular cancer in the left breast would have been discovered the same time they found the Ductal cancer in the right. A 5.1 cm Grade 1 Lobular ca with 23 positive nodes does not spring up overnight. I had 5 years of annual mammograms of that breast and the cancer was never detected, not even on the same day it was felt by the doctor. In 2000 Breast MRIs were just not being done on a routine basis, but with the knowledge today that standard mammograms can miss up to 50% of Lobular cancers and are only 85% effective at finding all Ductal cancers, I feel that breast MRIs should be standard for any woman with a history of dense breasts. I no longer have any breasts to scan, but I guarantee I would be insisting on annual breast MRIs if I did.",

      "Content": "Feb 27, 2011 06:29PM - edited Feb 27, 2011 06:31PM by LindaLou53 Well I have had my Class 2 ArmCare Medium sleeve for just over a week now and thought I should report back with my preliminary impressions.  First off, dealing with Sue over the phone was a delight.  She was very helpful, informative and sincere in helping me find the best garment for me.  The garment arrived in about 3-4 days after my order.  I took some pics of the box and instructional  materials that came along with the sleeve.  When I get a chance I will try to take pics of me actually wearing it if that helps others to see how it fits. Here are my initial feelings about the ArmCare sleeve: 1.  At first touch, the garment is extremely soft and stretchy.  It reminded me a little of stretch support panty hose in the feel.  I was cautious about my rough winter dry hands for fear I might \"catch\" in places and cause a snag in the material. I made sure to wear my LE donning gloves when handling the sleeve. 2.  Applying the sleeve after reading instructions was not difficult although the first time I put it on I thought the patch area at the antecubital was supposed to cover the outside of the elbow as reinforcement, then realized it was intended as a protective layer for the inside of the elbow area. 3.  I did not need to worry about the sleeve not fitting my long arms because it stretched very well to completely cover my shoulders and still stayed in place with the wrist cuff on my left arm. 4.  It took me 2 attempts to apply the sleeve so that the dorsal support band properly fit across my shoulder blades and below my neck. But I got the hang of it pretty quickly. 5.  The short non-compressive sleeve on my right arm surprised me that it came almost down to my elbow,  I was expecting a much shorter sleeve but it fully covered my upper arm. I felt the band at the end of the short sleeve was a little snug for my liking though.  Not sure how they calculate circumferences on the non-compressive side. 6.  As far as wearability and comfort the ArmCare was extremely comfortable, light, airy and hardly felt like I was wearing a sleeve at all.  I did of course need to wear my standard Mediven 550 CCL2 Glove which I overlapped on top the ArmCare sleeve.  My glove extends halfway up my forearm towards my elbow.  I normally wear my glove underneath my Mediven sleeve but with the cuff on the end of the ArmCare I felt it would be better to wear my glove on the outside.  I had to finesse pulling on the glove without causing the cuff of the ArmCare to roll down but found a way to make that work more consistently.  I may try putting my glove on first at some point and see if the sleeve fits over top well. 7.  I have worn the ArmCare for 3 total days alternating  between my Medi sleeve every other day.  As far as comfort the ArmCare gets 5 stars.  Ease of application is slightly trickier than a standard sleeve and glove but with a little practice I would say it rates 4.5 stars.  In spite of me feeling like the fabric was fairly fragile and at risk for snagging easily, I did not run into any major problems while wearing the garment or when readjusting it while on.  The fabric appears to be more hardy than at first glance. There were only a couple of areas of concern, but one of them is a big one and will take more time before I can make a final judgement regarding the efficacy of the ArmCare for me specifically. 1.  I did notice after wearing the ArmCare for several hours that there was a tendency for the garment to slip halfway off my shoulders on both sides.  Whether this is a factor of my arm length and the fabric gradually moving back over time to a state of less stretch I don't know. I would just tug on both sides and reposition the garment back over the top of my shoulders where it would stay for awhile before sliding down again. 2.  The only areas I noted any irritation at all were on my right unaffected arm where the material had a tendency to be a little snug in my axilla right under the arm pit and also the band at the end of the non-compressive sleeve.  It was not constrictive enough to cause indentations, redness or severe discomfort, just a mild sense of irritation in those spots.  Given that the garment comes in \"standard\" sizes and is not custom fit it is understandable that each individual's unique arm dimensions may not totally fit the full range of each size available.  My left LE arm was extremely comfortable though...seemed strange that my right arm was experiencing the minor irritations. 3.  For me the most significant question is does the CCL2 ArmCare sleeve effectively maintain proper compression and containment of my LE arm.  That is a question I cannot answer with any authority without more specific clinical data. My subjective sense was that after wearing the ArmCare for a full day I felt that my left upper LE arm might be a little \"fuller\"  but I do not have the measurements to back that up.  My plan is to start keeping a twice a day record of the circumference of my upper arm in 2 or 3 places.  I want to measure in the mornings after removing my JoviPak and then measure again in the evenings after removing my daytime garment.  I will continue to wear both my Mediven and alternating with the ArmCare for now until I can determine if my arm is in a stable pattern.  If it is, I will extend my wearing of the ArmCare to 2 days in a row and watch closely to see if there is any significant change in my arm circumference.  Obviously, other activities I do during the day may have any impact in addtion, so I will try to keep track of the variables.  I will be seeing my CLT therapist every 2 weeks and will get her input as to the tissue consistency and presentation of my arm also.  So it will be my own mini experiment. All in all I am very happy with the wearability and comfort of the ArmCare.  If it can successfully maintain my LE during the day then it will be a welcome change and alternate garment option for me to wear.  I will keep you all updated after a month or so of testing.     ",

One is that you have had a major surgery and your body is still going through a period of general inflammation as it attempts to heal.  Any kind of increased stress or inflammation in the body can create increased lymph fluid production.  Even though the surgery was not on your LE arm, your entire lymphatic system is effected and has to work under an additional burden created by the surgery itself. The other possibility, but I would think less likely, is that your surgery may have involved injury or removal of lymph nodes in the abdominal area.  If this is the case, in someone who already has LE and a compromised lymphatic system, any further damage could cause LE symptoms to worsen.  If your surgery was done completely vaginally, I would think the risk of this kind of damage would be much less than if you had an open abdominal surgery. I would continue doing what you are now, keeping up with your daily MLD, wearing your garments and checking in with your LE therapist.  My suspicion is that as the healing process completes and your general inflammation from the surgery reduces, your LE will show signs of improvement also.  If, however, your LE worsens dramatically in your arm or trunk along with pain or redness, you should definitely get it checked out to rule out any other possible causes such as DVT or infection. Living with LE really is a challenge and we have to be vigilant at all times.  It sounds to me like you are doing an excellent job of that.  Sometimes our LE is just very sensitive to changes in our environment and body, and with time a normal balance will be achieved again. Let us know how it goes for you.",

      "Content": "Jul 4, 2013 06:16PM LindaLou53 wrote: Hi Binney No, I have not used the Nexfin finger cuff system.  I had never even heard of it until I found this article.  I routinely google for any new research involving methods for monitoring BP just because I feel the current options for LE patients are pretty dismal.  It really is not so simple as thinking all we have to do is avoid the affected or at risk limbs. We obviously do not want to increase LE or infection risk unnecessarily but I think we must also be concerned with the increased risk of inaccurate BP readings, embolus and pain, as a result of improper technique, equipment and lack of experienced staff when it comes to using the legs.  In addition, current critical care units, surgical settings and IV sedation procedures use automatic BP devices that can pose particular risk to lymphedema patients.  The fact is, none of us know when we might end up in an ICU as a result of trauma or a health crisis.  Current critical care technology involves a fair amount of invasive procedures that pose risk to any patient but higher risk to diabetic, cardiac, pulmonary and other chronic condition patients, including LE patients.  In the bigger picture, any technological advancement that can accurately collect vital patient data in a non-invasive method is a win-win situation for us all. This research article (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic... was trying to identify accurate, non-invasive methods for continuous monitoring of a patient's vital status without resorting to the more expensive and risky invasive methods such as an arterial line. Obviously the researchers were not considering potential benefits to LE patients, however there certainly could be a positive impact for LE patients as a result.  Typically, ICU or critically ill patients are continuously monitored with invasive lines.  This most often means an arterial line which involves cannulating either the radial artery in the wrist, femoral artery in the groin or axillary artery in the chest. Other less common sites used for arterial lines are the brachial, ulnar, dorsal pedis, tibial posterior and temporal arteries.  These lines are used for monitoring BP, cardiac output and frequent blood gases.  While there may also be benefits in continuous monitoring of BP or cardiac output in non-critical, stable patients, the use of invasive lines in a stable patient is not advised due to the inherent risks and costs. So stable patients who might benefit from continuous monitoring are not currently getting that benefit.  The research article identifies potential patient populations where continuous monitoring is not currently the standard but could benefit from the new technology: Anesthesiology \"Continuous, totally noninvasive monitoring is possible in groups currently (nearly) unmonitored. Examples include orthopedic surgery in the elderly, abdominal surgery and bariatric surgery. In obese patients upper arm cuffs for BP measurement often do not fit, and thigh cuffs are needed, or a brachial cuff is used on the forearm. While the arms and legs can increase significantly in circumference, fingers do get larger but usually not up to the degree that the finger cuff does not fit.\" Emergency care Cardiology \"During invasive electrophysiology procedures, it is common practice to use an intra-arterial line to monitor BP in critical situations of hypotension caused by tachyarrhythmias or by intermittent incremental ventricular temporary pacing till to the maximally tolerated systolic BP fall. During such procedures Nexfin recorded reliable BP waveforms notwithstanding the presence of tachyarrhythmia. The authors stated that continuous noninvasive BP monitoring is feasible in the interventional electrophysiology laboratory and may replace intra-arterial BP in that setting.\" If a non-invasive method such as the Nexfin finger cuff system ultimately is deemed accurate and safe enough for providing continuous BP and CO readings in the critical patient, then hopefully that same technology can also be applied for more common use in the stable patient population when needed.  I suspect the cost and design of the current finger cuff technology would be too expensive and impractical for widespread use in individual outpatient offices or clinic settings.  Hopefully, if the demand becomes broader, the technology can be refined to lower cost and more portable designs that become the standard in doctor's office, diagnostic centers etc. Meanwhile, we continue to advocate for ourselves, educate our medical professionals and make the best choices that we can when possible.  Personally, I worry more about the emergent, critical care settings where our degree of personal control is much less or even non-existent. LE cannot be the primary focus in a life threatening emergency, but if the standards for critical care technology are moving towards more non-invasive methods, I am all for it!",

      "Content": "Aug 30, 2009 08:36PM - edited Aug 30, 2009 08:41PM by LindaLou53 Hi again Michele, I just posted to your other thread about the number of positive nodes you had.  Based on the path report information that you listed here it sounds like you have had more than just the first level of nodes removed.  In order to better understand the T3N3aMX you may want to check out this link: www.doctorslounge.com/oncology...  CBM is correct that the N3a does not mean you had 3 positive nodes but it refers to the location in the area around your clavicle or breast bone where positive nodes were found. These nodal areas are called infraclavicular, supraclavicular or internal mammary nodes so these are nodes not directly found in the axilla. It appears that N3a refers to the infraclavicular area which I believe is below the clavicle.  This all needs further clarification by your surgeon or oncologist. I believe that the two items you list as T4 which are found to be \"No\"  mean that there was no cancer found in the area of the chest wall muscles or in the skin. So this is definitely a good thing. Your surgical margins are all good since usually it is desireable to have clean margins of at least 2 mm and 0.2 cm is equal to 2 mm. Extracapsular extension just means that cancer had extended thru the capsule of one sentinel node.  I also had this in my diagnosis. While it is preferable if the cancer remains contained within the node it is not an untreatable situation. The fact that your tumor was ER and PR positive is very good because you will have the benefit of the anti-hormone medications like Tamoxifen or the Aromatase Inhibitors such as Aromasin, Arimidex or Femara. Michele a pathology report is overwhelming for anyone to fully understand and absorb. I totally agree that there is a wealth of information available here on these forums and it can be so beneficial to be prepared in advance with pertinent questions when you do see your docs.  Just remember that while all of us here are well intended as we offer up our own experiences and understanding, you must depend on your own medical team to have full access to all the intricacies and unique components of your diagnosis that we do not.  Continue to educate yourself and get familiar with the terminology.  Please keep asking questions here and know that so many of us know exactly what you are going through.  Just try not to jump to any conclusions until you have had indepth discussions with your docs and get your questions answered to your satisfaction regarding your treatment plan. Best Wishes...  Linda",

As you so well point out in that article there are many instances when FNA would be the preferred choice for diagnostic testing in cases of suspicious breast masses, thyroid nodules, liver and lung masses and others. Since this particular study was done to aid the decision process for whether to do SNB or ALND specifically in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, I was less enthused for its ability to prevent more invasive procedures. But I see your point, that in the big picture this is another option for patients with LE to promote to their physician's anytime a diagnostic test may be required. Thanks again for the wealth of information you provide and for the wonderful resource that LymphedmaPeople.com has been for many years!",

Here is an excerpt from the CDC's Vaccination Administration Guide on their website:  -Adults (19 Years and Older) For adults, the deltoid muscle is recommended for routine intramuscular vaccinations. The anterolateral thigh also can be used. I have been getting the flu shot in my thigh for the last 6 years ever since my LE dx.  My PMD offers a walk-in flu clinic for his patients so I just call ahead and let them know which day I will be there. This is the first year they told me they would have to get a longer needle for an IM shot into the thigh.  I think I must be one of the very few patients they do thigh injections for and perhaps they reviewed the literature this year for proper protocol. CDC quidelines call for use of a 1\" - 1 1/2\" needle, 22-25 gauge for standard IM shot into the Deltoid muscle of an adult.  A 1\" needle is adequate to reach the Deltoid for most adults but 1 1/2\" is more commonly used for obese patients or thigh injections.  I had no problem with them using a longer needle for my thigh even though I think the 1\" needle used in previous years was adequate for me.  BUT I did object when the nurse walked in with an 18 gauge needle.  I told her that she was going to have to get a much smaller gauge than that.....18 gauge needles / IV catheters are typically used for blood transfusions and surgery.  There was no need to poke a huge hole in my thigh to deliver a vaccination.  She came back with a 22 gauge 1 1/2\" needle which was fine. Some resources I read suggested that the gluteus muscles should be avoided as an injection site specifically for vaccinations because you don't want to risk hitting major nerve bundles or blood vessels. The anterolateral thigh (vastus lateralis muscle) is an acceptable alternative IM injection site for both adults and children. Nursing staff must use their assessment skills to determine if their patient has reasonable muscle mass at the injection site, or excessive adipose tissue which may require they adjust the needle length accordingly.  Gauge pertains to the size of the inner lumen of the needle and since most vaccines are not very viscous, a smaller gauge 22-25 lumen is perfectly adequate. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/vac-admin/default.htm#guide  So yes, we still have to continually educate ourselves and others to be our own best advocate. Changes for the better are coming....but still much too slowly!",

My next quilt I will plan to assemble one row at a time and snip each row before attaching the second row in order to space out the amount of time I am clipping through seams.  If you do not use a batting or 3rd layer of fabric in the middle of the block \"sandwich\" it will be easier to snip also.  The only real difficulty I had was cutting through the seam intersections where there were 12 layers of fabric.  It takes a very sharp pair of scissors and some wrist and hand strength to cut through the thick portions. It was still a very fun and simple project.  I have plans to start another one soon!   ",

I assume your oncologist will be discussing chemo options with you. You may also be discussing the possibility of limited radiation to the axillary area with your radiation oncologist. I have experienced both extremes of the decision on whether or not to have a total axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). With my first BC dx in 2000 I had 6 nodes removed by SNB which came back clean during surgery but 10 days later they found micromets to 2 of the nodes. My surgeon wanted to go back and remove more nodes but since I knew chemo and radiation would be part of my treatment plan anyway, I refused the additional surgery. I was concerned about increasing my risk of lymphedema (LE) with additional nodes removed and felt that the chemo and radiation would be adequate. So in this case I felt the risk of further nodal surgery was not worth the additional benefit if any. As it turned out, my first BC was totally eradicated, never returned and there was no evidence of it when I had my bilateral mastectomy in 2005 I did have a second primary BC in the opposite breast in 2005, unrelated to the first and this time with obvious nodal involvement.  I had a total ALND of all 3 levels of nodes and all 23 nodes removed were positive. In that situation, because the cancer was so locally advanced in the axilla, I was very glad to have each of those 23 tumor sites removed surgically. I again went through several rounds of chemo and intensive 3 field radiation and am now 3.5 years out from that second dx.  I did develop lymphedema in my left arm, but am so grateful that so far my right arm which is still at risk, remains free of LE.  I'm not sure that would be the case if I had opted for more nodal dissection on that side back in 2000. What I am trying to emphasize is that each person's case will vary depending on a variety of factors.  What is the aggressiveness of the cancer?  How many nodes are involved? Is chemo and rads already going to be a part of the treatment plan? Does the patient have a strong family history or is BRCA+ ?   The primary goal should always be successful treatment of the BC without taking undue risks of overtreatment.  The patient's own personal risk tolerance and peace of mind that they have done everything they feel is necessary, must also be considered. Kayleigh, try writing down your questions for your next appointment and also take someone with you so you can be sure of what has been discussed. Make sure you have a full understanding of the pathology of your cancer and what it will take for you to feel comfortable with the treatment plan. At that point all we can do is trust in our professionals and the decisions we make based on the best information we have available. Please let us know how it goes for you at the appointment. Best Wishes, Linda",

The latest thinking regarding \"snapping\"  the cords by a PT is that it may be best NOT to do that.  Slow, gradual stretching and massage seems to be better tolerated and more effective in the long run without causing the sudden painful and inflammatory response that you can get when breaking the cords.  I think your current PT is on the right track to continue working on the area without trying to snap the cords.  Generally, cording will get better over time with consistent gentle stretching. I had cording of the chest wall (sometimes called Mondor's Disease) after both my lumpectomy and my bilateral mastectomy.  I also developed cording of the axilla and arm following radiation. With good PT and constant stretching exercises the cording has pretty much gone away.  I still have what is either remnants of cording or scar tissue in my axilla but have regained good range of motion.  Be sure to check out the 2 threads I bumped up for you.  There is lots of great info there and many other ladies who have experienced the same syndrome as you.  ",

I have revived an old sewing skill recently though and am really enjoying it.  I used to sew all my own clothes from the time I was in Junior High Home Ec class and all through my early married years.  My 38 year old sewing machine though has sat collecting dust for the last 15 years or so.  I finally decided to upgrade to a new computerized machine and am having a ball making \"non-clothing\" items for the first time!  So far I have made some interesting tote bags and hand bags out of remnant fabrics,  some unique pin cushions, am wearing my homemade microbead breast forms and have just recently discovered rag quilting!  My cousin adopted a beautiful 10 month old baby girl from Ethiopia and I am in the process of making a Baby Rag Quilt for her.  It is basic sewing skills only and a fairly fast assembly process once you cutout all your blocks.  Like Binney I have taken up using a rotary cutter and cutting mat to speed things up and save the wear and tear on my hand. Here is a great link to a video showing how to make a rag quilt along with downloadable instructions.  This is a nice way to satisfy the creative crafting \"bug\"  without having to battle with the LE too much! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-LQfYXrG_Q",

Here is a pic of an old tank top with a shelf bra that I converted to pockets and used extra stitching to help shape the microbead forms like they would be in a standard bra cup.  The forms have nice projection even when not wearing them.    One thing to remember about these lightweight microbead forms is that they will shape to whatever pressure is applied to them and will take the shape of the container they are held in.  When I drive with the seatbelt across my chest it does tend to flatten the right form but then I just do a little \"hand molding' to push it back to normal shape after removing the seat belt. I love the TLC microbead forms and they are the only forms I have found I am willing to wear.  I don't think the size of the form makes a difference.  It is just a characteristic of the very mobile microbeads in a light stretchy covering.  Try wearing a different type of bra or top with a smaller bra pocket and see if you notice a difference in achieving the profile you are looking for.",

I have a heavy investment both emotionally and physically in Zometa since I have been receiving IV infusions for almost 5 years now.  Obviously, there is no way I can know beyond certainty why I still remain NED 5 years after having 23 positive nodes but my gut tells me the Zometa has had a role to play in that.  I will be seeing my onc in mid January and will discuss the topic with her but I am more than willing to continue to get what will be my last Zometa dose in July of 2011. Based on the Azure results it appears I may meet the criteria for the subgroup of women who did show benefit from Zometa.  I went into chemo induced menopause in 2000 after my first BC dx at the age of 47 so was definitely post-menopausal in 2005 when I had my second primary BC dx at the age of 52.  My estrogen levels a few years ago were at a low of 8 plus I have been on Aromasin for 4.5 years.  I started on Zometa infusions in 2006 immediately following chemo and radiation txs and have now had a total of 10 infusions with my 11th and final dose scheduled for July. I know that my oncologist will have an opinion on the recent study data and I will be very interested to hear her perspective as it relates to me and my cancer presentation specifically.  Obviously, each of us has to be treated uniquely and with therapy that is designed to target our BC pathology and presentation.  I still hold out strong hope that Zometa will be found to be a powerful cancer treatment weapon for many of us.  I am not inclined to disregard its usefulness based solely on the Azure trial but hope to see a trend revealed by future studies that can refine under what circumstances Zometa is best used. Its not time to give up on Zometa yet. I believe the jury is still out and there is just too much positive data to disregard at this point. I do believe, however that it is wise to have ongoing discussions with your oncologists to help understand why it may be more appropriate for some and not others.  ",

      "Content": "Sep 7, 2013 11:35AM - edited Sep 7, 2013 11:41AM by LindaLou53 I have been going to the same chemo infusion center for over 13 years now.  After 2 different primary breast cancers, both which required chemotherapy, the nursing staff became very familiar with my hard to find, easy to blow, fragile veins.  They also are the most adept and knowledgeable blood drawers in my experience, compared to the often less experienced staff found in physician offices, clinics or radiology departments. This is by no means a condemnation of the many excellent staff who are talented blood drawers in those other areas, but I have found that there can be a disturbing inconsistency in the expertise of those staff as a whole.  If you can request a specific person who you have had good experiences with, then great!  But otherwise it is often a gamble in areas where starting IVs or blood drawing is not the main job of that individual. After a few bad experiences in hospital labs and doctor's offices, I many years ago began to get all my required blood draws or IV starts for annual scans done at my chemo center by the nurses there.  Since I see my oncologist every 6 months, I always schedule my annual physical with my PMD at a time close to one of my oncology visits.  I contact my PMD's office and ask them to send a script for any requested labwork to the chemo center office.  The day of my oncology visit I get all bloodwork drawn by the nurses in the chemo center for both my oncologist and PMD.  Everybody gets copies of the lab results, I get one stick for multiple labs and feel that at least I am minimizing my risks by limiting the number of sticks I get each year, plus utilizing the staff I feel are most likely to protect my veins. When it comes to my annual CT scans, I schedule an appointment with the chemo center to have my Hep Lock inserted one hour before I am due to report to radiology for the scan.  The radiology staff is always thrilled to see me show up with a line already in place for the contrast media.  After the scan is completed, the radiology staff remove the Hep Lock, apply a pressure bandage and send me on my way.  I generally, remove the pressure bandage myself 10 minutes later, check the site to be sure it no longer needs a pressure bandage, then apply Neosporin and a standard bandaid which I wear for the rest of the day to protect the area. Obviously, these steps I take are for pre-scheduled, non-emergency events where I know in advance that I will need labwork or an IV stick.  In a medical emergency situation, about all we can do is communicate to staff our significant medical history and precautions for at-risk limbs in whatever method we have available.  Certainly, having informed family members who can inform staff when we cannot ourselves, is a big help.  Also having a document in your purse or on your person, with your full medical history, including all surgeries, medications, allergies and instructions for avoiding blood draws, blood pressures etc. in at-risk limbs etc. is very important. I have found a great website that has a number of free downloadable forms that you can fill out and keep copies for your family members and yourself to have on hand when needed.  I use the Emergency Form to keep all my most important medical information handy and update it as needed each year.  I always keep a copy in my purse.  My husband and I also keep copies of each other's emergency form in the event we need to have their information readily available.  Here are the links to the downloadable forms.  You will be asked to provide your email address but after that you can download all the free forms if you choose.  These are Adobe forms that allow you to fill them out using your computer.

I do own the BiaCare MedaHand that I wear over top my old daytime glove for additional hand compression.  The construction quality seems good and it is very comfortable.  I suspect the CompreSleeve might be a good low cost alternative to the more expensive nighttime garments.  I will be interested to hear Jane's review of the sleeve after she uses it!",

I have been starting out slow making simple hot pads, mug runners etc....but just completed a quilt project for my friend's 7 year old daughter.  It is a simple bed runner that lies across the foot of her bed and has block pockets on both ends to store her story books and treasures in.          It was my first major quilt project, first attempt at binding and machine quilting....and I LOVED it!  Made lots of mistakes but am learning rapidly and eager to move on to the next project.  Have become a \"Fabriholic\"  and am building up a fabric stash I probably could not use in 2 lifetimes! Anyway, as LE ladies who have concerns for protecting our skin while around sharp needles, pins and scissors I have just ordered a product I have high hopes for being very useful in that regard.  Trust me I was constantly washing, disinfecting and applying antibacterial ointment to the many pin pricks I got in my fingers as I worked on my quilt project and felt there HAS to be a better way to protect fingers and still retain dexterity and ability to do hand work.  I came across a product called Finger Gloves which I ordered and will report back on after using them.  According to the many testimonials however, they seem to be a favorite among crafters and hobbyists. Since having the LE and peripheral neuropathy from the chemo my handsewing days are pretty much over so I am attempting to do everything I can by machine.  There is still no avoiding the \"sharps\" that are involved in the process though so if any one else has any tips, techniques or products that will help those of us who don't want to give up our craft hobbies, please post here!  Love seeing pics of everyone's work too.....so feel free to add yours!  ",
