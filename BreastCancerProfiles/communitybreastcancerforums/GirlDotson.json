    "Content": "GirlDotson wrote: Hi all, I am trying not to be too paranoid (but as you can probably imagine, I have scoured the 'net looking for info) here, but I found an odd shaped lump in the upper right part of my breast, more towards my armpit, but not in my armpit. The lump feels about 1 1/2\" by about 1/2\". Just south of the oblong-feeling lump is a \"ditch\" under my skin that seems to go along the bottom edge of the lump. It isn't rounded, but more lumpy. When I raise my arm above my head (standing), the ditch/lump are visually noticeable. When I lay flat, both are palpable. I am large busted, and have a history (mom and maternal grandmother) of breast cancer. My g-ma passed from it a few years ago. I had one mammo few years ago that showed fibrous tissue that I never knew about or felt. This current lump does not hurt or move about. It is solid, as well. It's sort of ironic. I just had my yearly female exam, and am scheduled to have my annual mammo Tuesday. I had just remembered I had to cal my gyno to have them change the order to a \"screening\" instead of diagnostic, and happened to feel my breast unconsciously. I don't have to have them change the order now. Anyhow, I just wondered if anyone has any thoughts on my lump. With the research I did, I really do not think this is going to turn out well. All the symptoms I have are more consistent with a malignancy than a benign tumor. Holy crap, y'all, what if this is really it? GirlDotson Log in to post a reply",
