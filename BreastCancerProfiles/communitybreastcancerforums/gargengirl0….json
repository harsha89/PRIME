I'm getting radiation to three spots; where the tumor was, where the lymph nodes were removed under my arm, and above the tumor site (chest/neck area). Creativevintage-I also felt some soreness after my treatments, especially in the evening. The Radiation Oncologist said that occurs in a small percentage of people. It felt like an internal sunburn? Crazy description I know. :-) Mdoc-hope you are feeling well. So great that you had dinner made for you! If it weren't for friends and family bringing us meals throughout my chemo, we would have lived on cereal! I am also a twin. I have a fraternal twin sister! She's been great through this! ",

I'm not even sure I want to think about what it's like, but curious if anyone has had one done, and how bad was it? This area could be a vessel island. Oncologist is sending me to a neurosurgeon. This area has been seen on MRI twice in the past year. Thanks in advance.",

I had a cough that wouldn't go away, which led to a chest x-ray to rule out pneumonia, which showed soft tissue abnormality. That lead to a CT scan, which led to a PET scan. The Pet scan shows: \"abnormal hyper-metabolic activity is present T10-T11 vertebral bodies, the right posterior ilium, right ilium adjacent to the acetabulum and left ischium. Abnormal soft tissue activity seen in the hilar lymph nodes.\" I had a bronchoscope with biopsy yesterday. No pathology report yet. Preliminary look didn't show cancer in those lymph nodes. My question is, has anyone had a similar reading on a PET scan and had the hip biopsied? I'm worn out at this point, and a little worried. I thought I was done with doctor appointments, tests and procedures. Positive thoughts and healing thoughts welcome. :-) I also cross posted this in the not diagnosed but worried group. Thanks!!!",

My MO is reluctant to stop Herceptin. I'm not crazy about having rashes and inflammation throughout my body. There was talk of adding Dexamethasone back into the picture. Ugh. I am so over steroids. Just my luck to keep things interesting. ;-)",
