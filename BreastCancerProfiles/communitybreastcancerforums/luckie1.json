I happened to do my breast exam and when I stimulated the nipple, clear discharge came out. I immediately freaked because I am young, single, no kids. When I called my  Primary doctor,  I ended up talking to her Nurse practitioner who ordered a prolactin level and thyroid hormone. Lab results came back negagtive. She suggested I should have a mammogram along with an ultrasound. The ultrasound showed a possible papilloma but the doctor wanted to do a biopsy. I had the biopsy Thursday and I am currently waiting for the results. Either way I will probably need a procedure to stop the discharge.  My doctor has not suggested an MRI which I am currently questioning becuase in the last couple of months my vision gets blurred with my contacts and I can't keep my balance at certain times. Hopefully, all this is not related. I keep saying it is stress related.  For the both of us I hope it is just a papilloma which is a non-cancerous wart like tumor that grows inside the breast duct.",
