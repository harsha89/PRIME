I still have my drain tubes in and am trying to stay quiet and down to reduce the fluid production. My problem is that I have lost a great deal of weight on this journey and have developed a rather painful pressure sore on my tail bone.   My daughter brought me a memory foam pad and pillow for my bed yesterday and it helped a little.  Has anyone else had this issue and do you have any suggestions for how to keep it from worsening or how to heal it before it becomes a greater issue? Thank you in advance and thanks for all of the awesome information you all share here. I have been reading through the forums and have found some great information here~  Wishing you all peace~ Kristin Dx 12/3/2011, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, 1/17 nodes, PR+, HER2+ Targeted Therapy 1/11/2012 Herceptin (trastuzumab) Chemotherapy 1/11/2012 Carboplatin (Paraplatin), Taxotere (docetaxel) Surgery 5/21/2012 Lymph node removal: Left, Sentinel, Underarm/Axillary; Mastectomy: Left, Right Radiation Therapy Log in to post a reply",
