Everything has happened so fast and I feel as though I barely have had a chance to think about it much less make informed decisions. One day I was happily going about my business and the next day I have no breasts. Hearing from others who have been down a similar road is very comforting and I truly appreciate your thoughts and kind words.",

I'm 49 and was diagnosed on October 10 with a 2cm invasive DCIS, had a BMX on 10/28, I'm ER/PR+, HER2-, they removed a node and it was clean. My Oncotype score is 18. My oncologist suggested Tamoxifen. I should be happy about him not recommending chemo, but I am concerned. I'm also concerned to talk about it because I don't want the doc or others to think I'm crazy and want the chemo. I was so hoping the number could be lower. I did talk to the PA at the oncology office briefly. She said they base the treatment off of many factors, not just the Oncotype score. My mother (age 70 at diagnosis) had breast cancer (same type), had a lumpectomy and Tamoxifen and that was 6 years ago with no recurrence. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. I'm afraid and don't ever want to deal with this again. Thank you. Jill",
