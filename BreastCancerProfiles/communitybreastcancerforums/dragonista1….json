As for xanax - hey, I figure whatever we need to get us through, that's what we do, right? I thought I'd have my results yesterday, but nope, nothing. I sort of practiced, as others have mentioned, thinking OK, I have cancer, what's my next step? I'm afraid to be too optimistic, given the particulars in my situation. I was actually relieved last night not to have bad information and ended up sleeping like a baby. Of course, I pretty much jump out of my skin ever time the phone rings. I will definitely be getting my results today, probably in the next couple of hours, and am a wreck. I literally can't see straight - the stress is making my vision wonky. Just trying to keep busy. Even my little dogs know something's up, they're being extra attentive and affectionate.  A few people know I had the biopsy - only the ones who have a good understanding of what this is all about. I sent them emails when I got home, letting them know things went just fine and I was recovering. I'm thankful that no one has called, even though I know they're anxiously waiting to hear. I don't want to talk to anyone yet. I'm thankful for this website. I learned about BI-RADS ratings here, so I asked the radiologist what mine is as she was doing the prep stuff pre-biopsy. I thought she'd say 3, she said 4. I know it's possible this *thing* is benign (no mass, btw), but still feeling pretty doomed right now.  I wish you great luck with your upcoming procedure, thinking positive thoughts for you, and everyone. I wanna get off this train now! Conductor ... let me out please!!  ",

The margins weren't great, so scheduled for an MRI Friday of next week. A double eternity, I think. I also think this breast is getting waaaay too many selfies lately. Way. Ugh. OK. I realize things could be worse. Things could also be better.",

I guess I'll have the dreaded weekend wait for results. Apparently I need bloodwork before this MRI - don't know way, never needed that before, seems ominous to me, but will find out what they're looking for. Meanwhile, it seems I have this whole week to get used to the idea that I have this \"thang\". Still trouble saying it, unless I'm making a joke. (oh...so many bad jokes! but it helps me deal...) Not too many people know. Those who do are concerned and are asking good questions, but I just don't have the answers yet. Note to self: don't tell anyone else before getting those answers... Meanwhile, no one has yet told me I'm lucky that this is \"all\" I have. I have gotten a taste of the dynamics of telling people, though. Apparently I remain the calm one, helping to calm others' anxiety. Not sure how long or well that will last. This is going to be eye-opening in so many ways. I prefer to think about things like this, rather than more tests and rads, etc. Also - I've always been the anti-journaler - until now. I plan to journal, I think it will help me organize my thoughts and stay grounded, and probably help in other ways. Just another way my world is becoming lopsided:)",
