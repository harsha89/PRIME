      "Content": "Mar 8, 2011 05:04PM - edited Mar 8, 2011 05:05PM by bluegems sgreenarch, We are among the lucky ones able to have children. I was blessed with 2 but suffered the loss of a preemie before my daughter was born 9 weeks early. My IDC was found by a routine mammogram. I'm almost 3 years out of radiation, and just had the mammo that put me back on the yearly schedule. I'm not interested in the lawsuit, and although I think DES exposure is related to my breast cancer, there's not enough concrete evidence to say DES causes breast cancer. But I put it out there for those who might be interested. I've known about the DES since I was 11, but didn't know about the T-shape uterus and incompetent cervix until I lost my first son. Unfortunately, I find myself educating my docs about DES. We're retired military, so I've seen many as we've moved or they've moved. The gyn was going to wait and watch the vaginal lump I found recently. If I hadn't mentioned I was DES exposed (again), he wouldn't have biopsied it. Fortunately it was just fibrous, and afterwards he was willing to look at the pap procedure recommended for DES daughters even after a hysterectomy. It's up to the ladies to push for yearly mammos, now that the guidelines have changed again. DES exposure puts a woman in a separate category, and she needs to be persistant with her doc or find another who is willing to be educated on DES if (s)he isn't already.",

I recently joined DES Action  http://www.desaction.org/   Their website is chock full of information and research. You can also go to www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/DES for a comprehensive Q&A. I too, am very careful about anything that might act as an estrogen, to include sunscreen. I use only titanium dioxide and zinc oxide - no oxybenzone or avobenzone for me! I had to do 4 weeks of premarin cream after my vaginal biopsy in order to heal correctly, but I offered that one up to God. Hope this helps. Take care, Judy",
