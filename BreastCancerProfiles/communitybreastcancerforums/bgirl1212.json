During the appointment, the tech found nothing but felt the lump. She had the radiologist come in and try to detect the lump himself. He went over the area several times but could not find anything, however, stated that he felt the lump. He also noted that it was slightly lower than where my ob/gyn said it was in her notes. The radiologist said he would provide his notes to my ob/gyn and that she should be in touch with me soon and may arrange a consult with a surgeon. I'm just wondering for those of you who discovered a lump in your breast, what other signs/symptoms were present? I've been reading a lot about the early signs and symptoms of breast cancer (rash/inverted nipple/dimpling/lump in armpit/fatigue/etc...). All i have noticed is my lump (which I discovered because it's painful when you press down on it). Also, I'm noticing that my upper back is incredibly sore. I've been out and about this weekend so maybe that's why? I was initially glad to hear that they saw nothing in the ultrasound, but now I'm actually more anxious because they felt something that cannot be seen. Now I need to know what it is!
