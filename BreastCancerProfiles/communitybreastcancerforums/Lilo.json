Next week is filled with appts....port placement, echo, PET scan, chemo training and maybe wig shopping. I had my BMX on 12/9 and still have 2 out of 4 drains in. I am hoping tomorrow is the day I get them out. I meet with the PS and will go over my treatment plan. Well, I will be posting here with everyone else and want to say that I am so grateful for all of you and the support we give each other.",

Tlgio17 and Goincrzy8...it is nice to see familiar faces from the December surgery board. It sucks that we have to be here too but together we WILL kick cancers butt. So far it sounds like every ones port placement and 1st treatment has gone pretty well. Love and hugs to all.",

BG46TN...I'm happy to hear you didn't have many SE with your AC treatment. Did you loose your hair? I hear that some women don't. That is actually the scariest for me. So I went to my out of town workshop. I had a momentary panic attack when I was getting ready to leave the hotel and my hubby last night. It was the first time in 5 weeks he wasn't going to be with me to take care of me. I worked thru it but it was a but of an eye opener. I decided to skip today's classes and come home. I just am not ready to go out yet. It's rainy here so I'm snuggled in bed with sweet puppy. Going to take it easy today.",

I struggle with the fact that my kids have to watch me during this process and will be sad. They are so very supportive though. Thank you for the water tip. I am a water drinker and it would horrible if I couldn't drink it anymore. BG46TN..thabk you for confirming the hair lose. I am going to have to dig deep on that one. Zolagirl..it is ok to be an emotional roller-coaster. We are going thru a very difficult journey and will have our ups and downs. Just go with the feelings at the time. Hair loss is definitely going to be a struggle for me. But, I will be saving lots of money by not going to the salon. Maybe I will put the $90 in a jar every 7 weeks and use it to celebrate when this is all over. Tere1...I can't imagine what you must be feeling. Did you have a breast biopsy prior to your mx? That is so weird that they cant find it. BRCA+ is definitely something that would make your treatment more aggressive. I'm having a PET scan tomorrow and have been second guessing my chemo treatments prior to the reaults. The only thing keeping me moving forward is that my treatment plan matches everyone else's with a similar DX. Showmama....most of us with your treatment plan are getting it every 2 weeks vs 3 weeks. Neulasta can be given as a shot the day after chemo or there is a thing that is put on your body that automatically injects you so you don't have to go back to the dr. Tlgio47...we will be getting our port placement on the same day. I will be thinking and praying for you. My chemo starts 1/18. Hugs and love everyone.",

I am going to see him again next week in the morning before my port placement. That will be 5 weeks that I had drains in. I am getting the Neulasta as a shot the day after my chemo. I just saw an ad about the automatic injector type. I wish I could have that I instead of going in the next day. My treatments are 50 miles one way so all these appts really add up. I am still positive. It has become my new mantra. Hugs to all.",

Meeting with my boss today to tell him of the change of plans. I won't be back full time 1/23. I take Zyrtec daily. Does anyone know if that will work the same as Claritin for the Neulasta pain? Betsy...hopefully the nausea goes away soon. I would be open to FB in addition to our forum. I agree it is difficult to comment on everyone's post and I really like to give personal shout outs to everyone. Well I I have decided not to use the cold cap and no wig. I have been checking out headwraps and wear. There are actually some really cute ones out there. I have bangs normally and you can actually buy bangs that can be attached to a headband that goes under hats and wraps. I'm not sure of the hair loss timeline though. There is a program through the American Cancer Society that offers workshops and a free makeup kit to women with cancer. The website is www.lookgoodfeelbetter.org. You can put in your zip code for a workshop near you. I am definitely going to sign up. The more support the better. Hope everyone can get some rest and have an enjoyable weekend. Hugs and love.
