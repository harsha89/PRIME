I'm hoping for B9 results but am trying to prepare for otherwise! How did all of you get thru the \"waiting game?\" I'm trying to stay distracted and busy w/my two children which helps...but still. So conflicted, on one hand I want Tuesday to hurry up and get here and on the other want to avoid it at all costs. I keep telling myself that if it is BC, it is very early  and the dr. removed the entire area of suspicious cells. Still very scared, I'm 41 and like so many here...never dreamt that I would be faced w/this.  Thanks for all of the support and kind words. This website has been wonderful...my searches on the internet only led to panic! The women on here have been so positive and supportive, just what us scared out of our minds newbies need! Thanks much!!!!   Log in to post a reply",
