I am in NJ and presently seeing Dr. Dultz and am happy with her care, however my fiance' had to practically pry out other options other than a simple mastectomy as that was her first proffering. I was incredulous and actually asked, if I was in a time machine..and was this 1975? I am floored at this as the first recommendation. I do have multi-focal DCIS, however it is contained to one quadrant, left upper outer. She did indicate that they can do a quadrantectomy with reconstruction. I, frankly, could care less about cosmesis right now. I just want these nasty abberrant cells out!!!!!!!! Also, I would like recommendations on greater prognostic indicators and tools to immediately detect if the margins are clear. I am not against re-excision, I want to take this in a step-wise fashion and feel as though a mx would be too much to entail physically as I'm just grappling with the emotional toll this is taking on me. I feel out of myself, numb, weak, shaky, anxious and just plain disheartened at the LACK of less invasive, viable options for those of us with (thank goodness) early disease. I am slated for surgery the 3rd week of January. I will be consulting with UPENN as my next step especially if rads is warranted, due to their offering precision based radiotherapy. I am also having my pathology slides sent to a BREAST pathologist based out of Long Island for another opinion. I am leaving no stone un-turned, especially given the horrifying options of having body parts removed, either partially or wholly. Any and all comments welcomed. Glad to have found you all. Thanks for listening. What a wonderful community.",

      "Content": "Kar324 wrote: Hi everyone, New here, from NJ recently received dx of DCIS, stage 0,intermediate grade cribiform per pathology report. I am 47 years old and my mother did succumb to breast CA, however she was dx'd very late stage, and did pass away at the age of 70. She did not have any routine screenings, sadly. I'm due to meet with my breast surgeon to discuss the next phase, lumpectomy. I was wondering if anyone has ever had a lumpectomy with local anesthesia and sedation? As a registered nurse with ironically, a background in oncology, I know the stress general anesthesia can take on the body. I am very fit, always eat healthy, however I am all about reserving general anesthesia for the most dire cases, personally for me, I have some heart palpitations (NSVT) and am super anxious about the toll general anesthesia will have on me. Also, I am super sensitive to medications, etc. Please if anyone has had a lumpectomy or excisional bx with local and sedation, share your experiences. I am new and want to ascertain all of the pros and cons. Glad to be here, but sad to be here. Thank you in advance for your replies. Dx 12/8/2015, DCIS, Left, Stage 0, Grade 2, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

My pathology slides are being unbiasedly reviewed by an independent breast pathologist Â Trust your gut. If you're panicking. Please ask for the rationale for such a drastic first step from your surgeon. Are there lymph nodes involved? It's crazy to be here. Ask if there is harm in waiting a week. Ask. Ask. Ask. So sorry you're going through this. It's harrowing. God speed on whatever you decide.",
