I have a friend who has taken Arimidex for 3 years and never had the first SE from it. I tried it and got quite nauseated but the MO quickly switched me to Aromasin and that caused no nausea. I do have a bit more joint pain and some insomnia but had some of both prior to the medicine so the difference is not that bad. I have been on it for 4 months and have found that the SEs have not gotten any worse over time and that helps. Also I feel much better when I exercise and there is good data for the value of exercise in preventing recurrence so that keeps me motivated. I had a total knee replacement just 3 months before I was diagnosed so being able to get back to a regular walking routine feels like a treat to me. I also cut way back on sugar (except for a couple of squares of dark chocolate a day) and the combination of exercise and reduced sugar means that I haven't gained any weight at all. The tumor has shrunk dramatically so it has all been worth it. Surgery soon, then radiation and AI for at least 5 years. BTW I sent my unused Arimidex to my friend and we laughed that it woulld be pretty funny if two old ladies who were way too straight for the drug scene in the 60s were to be busted for shipping drugs in their mid 70s. If you read much on the hormone threads on here you get the idea that almost everyone on AIs has terrible SEs. Don't panic! The happy campers don't tend to post.Â ",

It was a clear case of been there done that. Because there is so little breast tissue left when implants are removed I had been wearing foobs for years and was used to them. I had to use the swim forms because there was just enough tissue left that I needed a form that was concave and the swim form was all that I could find. Now I am looking forward to getting some better quality forms. The other big factor to me was not wanting more surgery and pain. I had a knee replacement last May and I figure I have contributed enough to the surgical economy for one year. When I see how much trouble so many of the girls in our surgical group are having with their TEs I am more that grateful for my decision. The recovery after a plain BMX is much shorter and easier. I am leaving for 6 weeks in Florida just 3 weeks after my BMX and the doctor says I am good to go. There is no way that I could do that with reconstruction.",

Because they cut nerves there is a fair amount of numbness across the incision area and the sentinal node incision hurt more than the other ones. The drains are the worst part and it does hurt if you catch them on anything that tugs on them. Once they come out life gets a lot better. I am not one to suffer if I don't have to so I took vicoden for several days but needed very little after the drains came out at a week. The ice gel packs are wonderful and sleeping propped up a bit helps when the drains are in. Definitely take something before your apppointment when they pull the drains. One good thing is that they don't tend to use skin sutures any more so you don't have to worry about having them removed. You just have steri strips. Not having the reconstruction makes a bit difference pain wise. You will be fine and one big plus is that we never have to have another mammogram as long as we live. Woo Hoo!",

The down side to them is that they were quite long and came down part way over the hips and seemed bulky under pants. I cut them off above the waist and now they are soft and loose and very comfortable with just the puffs. Wow a trial that might make ILC more visible on mammogram! Now that would be real progress.

Cindy, if the breast center where you go is smart they will hire you as their CMO chief morale officer. You have a real gift and we are all blessed by it. Special thoughts and prayers to all who are having such terrible skin problems. It is painful just to read what you are going through. What amazingly brave sisters! I am betting that five years from now women will be getting much less radiation than we are getting. It seems that the history of cancer through the years has been one of starting out with \"shock and awe\" treatments and gradually working backwards to less is just as good. Surgery is much more conservative than it used to be and now with the Oncotype DX test many women can escape chemo or have lighter protocols but radiation is the last guest to the party. The research is coming from the countries where they have a financial incentive to find out what the minimum effective amount is. It makes me mad when they say \"well we don't have statistics on that.\" Of course one reason why we don't have the statistics is because thanks to our medical legal climate in this country doctors are terrified to deviate from \"standard of care\" for fear of getting sued. God bless the Brits and others who are working hard to get the answers so in the future women will suffer less.",

I think there is a better cross section on the surgery threads and on this one. I have been on aromasin for 8 months with minimal SEs. When I look at those tiny white pills and realize that they are essentially keeping me alive a little bit of joint pain and insomnia seems pretty insignificant. I took it preop and it shrunk the tumor dramatically and I will be on it for at least 5 years and maybe for life.

There is a historic story in my family about an experience that my naternal grandfather had. He was a pharmacist who owned a drug store in a very small town in West Virginia. It was in the middle of logging country and every Saturday morning the logging train came in to town and deposited the loggers who shopped and drank heavily and then went back late that evening on the train. One Saturday morning Grandaddy looked up from his counter to see a huge logger standing at his counter. He said \"Doc, I got me the piles (lay term for hemorroids in those days) and I want you to to sell me some Ben Gay(an old capsacion based cream).\" Grandaddy said that he would be happy to sell him something else for his piles but that he thought that Ben Gay was a very bad idea. There was no talking the man out of it. He said(Doc, this other feller told me about it and said that it cured his and I'm just a big a man as he is.\" That was the last trip before winter set in and Grandaddy often wondered what had happened to the man. The next Spring the man came back and Grandaddy anxiously asked him how the Ben Gay had worked. He said \"Doc if I ever meet that guy in the woods he is a dead man. I waited until a Sunday morning when we didn't have to work and I put it on and it started to burn and I lit out of the bunkhouse and ran down to the creek and chopped a hole in the ice and sat there till noon.\" Unless you have access to a frozen creek you might want to reconsider a therapy that puts Â capsacian on a burn.",

You can do this!Â  I got some good news today. Saw the MO and I had asked him to order an Oncotype DX for me and I assumed that it would be done at the time of surgery. Well apparently they went back and did it on the biopsy specimen because it was back and was a 6. Made my whole day. Love to all, Susan",

In the end the decision comes down to what you and your doctor decide is best for you. Some of the decision might hinge on whether you are planning to include the underarm area in your radiation treatment. I had a positive node but since we had already decided to radiate the node areas we are leaving it at that. My BS told me that she would not be surprised if in the future they won't be taking out a lot less nodes and substituting radiation instead. Much of the history of BC treatment is to start out with a scorched earth approach and gradually work back to less drastic approaches when research showed that they were just as successful. Of course the first few women who opted for lumpectomy with radiation instead of MX had to have a bit of courage but in the end they paved the way for much less disfiguring surgery for most women. We all have to decide what will let us sleep at night or at least most nights.",

Your story about the farting boob cracked me up and yes one of the things that I love the most about God is His sense of humor. Erdwoman, Maybe I am missing something here but why would they want to do an ALND after you finish chemo? If there was something there before it is quite likely that it will be gone by then. In fact one of the problems with neoadjuvant therapy is that when you finally do the surgery you will never know if the staging is accurate because all imaging is imprecise especially where lymph nodes are concerned and you don't know if the negative nodes at surgery were always negative or if the chemo or hormone therapy just cleaned them up. You might want to check the stats of incidence of lymphedema with ALND vs with radiation. Emily, sorry that the chemo is a bitch but glad that you have a trip to look forward to. That always makes a big difference in my attitude if I have something to look forward to. I got a sleeve too before I left home because I have to fly back in order to start my radiation on time. Incidentally while the Floridians are complaining about the cold I am thinking what great walking weather. I put my husband on a flight from Miami to Lima, Peru for a 2 1/2 week to SA with his former college roomate a trip both I and the other man's wife are ever so glad that we are not taking. I wish them well but I am also very grateful for a time of peace and quiet to do just what I want to just when I want to or to do nothing at all and not feel guilty about it. I am an only child and we tend to need a certain amount of alone time in order to thrive. This is especially true when you are healing.",

I would strongly urge you to remain in counseling even if your husband will not go. You need it to deal with your depression because if you are off your hormone therapy and not going for your regular check ups that qualifies as a serious threat to your health. Remember the old adage \"never screw your self to get back at someone else.\" Forget about your husband for the time being. Do you really want to do this to your kids? You don't sound like a quitter to me and now is not the time to give up. Men are far more fragile sexually than women are (my personal theory is that is because women can fake it and they can't) so they suffer from permanent performance anxiety. Just worrying about how they might react to body image changes is enough to send some into withdrawal and there are few things more terrifying to a man than the idea of therapy. They just can't accept the idea that they might be wrong or might need to change. You can't change another person, the only person that you can change is you. Of course the fact that you change and don't respond in the old ways will eventually force the other person to find new ways to relate but that is secondary to the changes that a good therapist can help you to make to regain your own health. Anger is a very common reaction to dealing with cancer and it can be very delayed and turned inward it can cause serious depression. Once you have sorted yourself out then you will be in a better position to decide what to do about your marriage whether the plusses outweigh the minuses. We all would like to have our old life back but it isn't going to happen. However what can happen is to work our way through the tough issues to a new normal and that new normal can be good.

I am scheduled for a BMX on the 21st of Jan. and it is always good to have others to share the journey with. After 30 years of never missing a mammogram wouldn't you know Â I managed to get a type of BC that won't show up on a mammogram or in my case an ultrasound either. I never knew that there was such a creature and I am a nurse. Go figure! So when I got the MRI from hell I was pretty shocked. However I have decided that it pays to be an old lady (73) when you get this because mine is strongly hormone sensitive so I got to do hormone therapy instead of chemo and it is much kinder and gentler. Also in my case very effective. The tumor is completely out of the chest muscle and about a third the size it was originally so I am way beyond grateful. I could have had the surgery sooner but why mess up the holidays and I am hoping that if it continues to melt I might be able to get by with a sentinal node rather than a full axillary node disection. The second breast is clean but emotionally I can't live with the fact that ILC has a tendancy to recur in the opposite breast and since it won't show on mammograms that totally freaks me out. I am not planning on having reconstruction. I had implants for over 30 years and it is a case of been there and done that. I had them out about five years ago and have been wearing fakes ever since so it is nothing new for me. The only difference is that now medicare will pay for them. I have been married for 51 years to a great man and have 3 grown children and 6 grandchildren. I am a compulsive reader and also love walking and travel. I have cleaned up my diet a whole lot since my diagnosis but a couple of squares of dark chocolate are essential to my survival. One of the best things about the BC community is that nothing matters except that we share a diagnosis, not age or race or money or education or religion or politics or anything else. We are all sisters. One of the first people to call me was the 28 year old daughter of a close friend who walked this trail a year ago. The age difference ment nothing. Too bad we have to have something like this happen to discover what real community is all about.",

Jojo, you might want to increase your fluid intake a bit it you have a fever. Dehydration is a major cause for fever. Jebdra, I have to tell you a funny story. Your experience with the girl who took you up to your room reminded me of it. Many many years ago when I was 14 my first job was working in a hospital doing a similar job. It was before the days of instant messaging or even pneumatic tube systems for transporting messages between departments so it was done by hand. The problem was that the very innocent people who started the program named it the call service and the boys who worked there were referred to as \"call boys\". Then they started hiring girls and it got dicey. One of our duties was to escort patients to their rooms from the admitting office and you should have seen the looks on the faces of the male patients when the stupid admitting clerk would announce \"the call girl will take you up to your room now\"! We got quite a few dirty looks from the wives also. Never let it be said that we were not a full service institution. What made it even funnier was that it was a church run hospital which probably accounted for the level of innocence that made such a mix up possible. It is so good to hear that so many of our courageous band of sisters are doing so well. It gives the rest of us hope.",

After having a thumb and knee replaced for arthritis joint pain is not exactly new for me but it really isn't bad and I find that I have a lot less when I exercise. You tend to be a bit stiff when you first stand up but once you get moving it improves quickly. Also a bit of insomnia but I had some of that before also so it is hard to tell what is new since these are such subjective symptoms. I have a good friend who has been on Arimidex for 3 years and had no SE except for a bit more osteoporosis. I had a very large tumor but since it was strongly hormone positive and I was older they let me do hormone therapy rather than chemo and it has been highly effective. The tumor is a very small fraction of it's original size. It is hard to believe that a pill that is that small could save my life. I would be a bit wary of the threads about hormone therapy because people tend to post more when they have problems than they do when all is going well. When I think that it saved me from chemo I am way beyond grateful. I too will be doing radiation post op so can't help you there. Good luck to you.",

I am assuming that when she says that you need to decide by next week she just means that you need to start some kind of treatment by then. Some of those are not mutually exclusive. Some people do really well on hormone therapy and some do not. I am one of the lucky ones and I also get really good results from it. Since you are hormone positive I would assume that they are going to want you to be on hormone therapy even after the chemo. Some people do reasonably well with chemo and some are miserable. You don't know up front which catagory you will fall in to. Everyone has to make the decision that fits them the best but I might be inclined with a borderline Oncotype to start with the easier stuff and progress to the tougher if I didn't get a good result. On the other hand some people would be forever second guessing themselves if they hadn't tried everything up front. Only you can decide which catagory you fit into. I notice there is no mention of radiation. Does she not think this would help?",

I don't know how the health system in Canada operates but I do know that all surgeons want to know if their patients develop any kind of an infection prior to surgery. I would definitely go to the clinic and have them contact the surgeon after checking you out. They could do blood work and vaginal smears to check for type of infection. That is definitely information that your surgeon needs to have. I am sorry that they have not been responsive to your calls.

If I had the view that you have from your hospital room I might be tempted to never go home and just think of the money that they would lose then!",

What is your area? Wish that you and my friend Abby Ramirez could get together. There is an organization called Young Survivor's Coalition that is located in Baltimore and works exclusively with young breast cancer patients. I had no idea that there are so many of them. She is doing an internship with them and you might find them to be a useful network for you.",

A clear case of someone finding what they are incredible gifted at and following their passion. I hope you will give serious consideration to turning your blog in to a book. Since I was diagnosed last summer I have been through a ton of breast cancer writing and for some reason most of the women who write about their experiences tend to be New Yorkers. It is past time for the West Coast to be better represented. I had implants for many years and had them removed about 5 years ago. It did hurt when they took the drains out but I learned from the experience. This time I will take a generous dose of pain medication and have someone else drive me to the appointment. In your case I would recommend a pain med that does NOT upset your stomach.lol",

Thank you God for a BS who was willing to run up to her office between cases on an OR day and take my drains out. I will love her forever. Now that I have graduated from PJs to a sweat suit it feels like formal night on a cruise ship. Now I can start gradually building my activity level up. I was terrified to do much of anything until I got rid of the drains for fear that I would have to keep them longer. dynadebbs everyone has an occasional down day and you are certainlly entitled when you coping with both surgery and the flu. Both will sap your evergy level dramatically and when your defenses are down like that every little thing that goes wrong seems like a huge problem that piled on top of everything else is just too much to deal with. This is a journey that is filled with ups and downs but keep your eyes on the destination-regaining your health and energy so that yu can live a full and long life. You will get there sooner than you think.",

It was gone by the time of surgery but the RO is still pretty freaked by it. It looks like the data that they gave you gives you the same odds for either hormone therapy with ovarian ablation or with chemo. My next question might be what if I do both of those things? What would the numbers be then? Because that is really what they are talking about if you do chemo first and then hormone therapy. If there is no difference then what difference does it make and if there is a difference how much is it and how much are you willing to go through in order to gain that extra advantage? An Oncotype of 18 is on the low side of the in between catagory where you have some choices about chemo.",
