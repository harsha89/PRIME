It's pressing on my arm thus the lymphadema, swelling and pain...oncologist called it metastatic breast cancer...said it was treatable but not curable... started me on Taxol...she says I have to be on it for the REST OF MY LIFE!!! Never heard of such a thing!!! I can't have any more radiation to that area...it's inoperable becuz it is deep and near my main aorta...my ONLY option is chemo...I now am suffering with neuropathy in fingers and toes, I have terrible bone pain and a host of other side effects from the chemo...My oncologist prescribed Lyrica, have been on for 3-4 weeks and haven't noticed anything...she has offered me percocet and vicodin but I don't want those addicting drugs and plus they make me nauseous and shaky!! Friends and family told me I should ask for a medical marijuana card...I have a high threshold for pain, took only motrin after ALL my surgeries, including mastectomies! I did try pot and it really helped!!! However my oncologist says she does not prescribe this...I'm in alot of pain with my legs back arms and rt breast area and it feels like my arm is in a vice! Wondered what your thoughts are and would appreciate any advice....I never heard of chemo (infusion) for life...have any of you?? Thankyou for listening!!! Paula",
