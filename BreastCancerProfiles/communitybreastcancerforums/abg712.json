I have been searching for a multi focal BC oncologist (ER+ and right after prehnancy)in NYC without luck. Not the way they organize their specialties but I am worried.",

I would say the mental fear was worse than the actual pain. A few things from me: - I am a big pain wimp and found overall, it was a tough 2 days in hospital, a rough first week at home. Then things got real better/ easier starting day 7 for me. - I had to stay 2 nights and 2 days because I / we did not stay on track w pain meds. Reco: Take them on schedule (4-6 hrs) the first days in hospital, even if you feel like no pain. Keep them up. I was on : oxy for more acute surgical pain and Valium for inner tightness and deeper muscle hurt. I took both in hospital and went home w both. I found they were each effective for different discomfort. At home I went off Oxy after a few days, but still needed the Valium for a full week or 9 days. - get a nightshirt that buttons down the front and flannel shirts with front buttons. - also the front zip up surgical camisole is comfortable and easy to put on - it has drain holders that you use, then remove - Now, I am on Aleve 2 weeks later - still need it daily as I move more - I got a \"husband\" pillow for sleeping half upright. It helped the first few nights at home. - you need to stay ahead of constipation while on oxy etc, starting in hospital and at home: colase pills or other, prune juice, and more. - with drains, you also take an antibiotic. Removing the drain did not hurt me. I asked if I shd take a pill before and they said no. It was ok. - Started the light arm stretches and exercises 12 days later. Focus on having a complication free surgery firstly! Do what they tell you, push and ask questions, wash your hands, report anything unusual and focus on healing. Xxoo ",

      "Content": "Mar 1, 2017 10:24PM - edited Mar 1, 2017 10:40PM by abg712 hi all ladies! I'm just wondering how everyone is doing who had surgery in Feb. Mine was Feb 6. Mastectomy and SNB and tissue expander. Post- surgically, I'm doing ok 3 weeks out. I am doing my arm exercises and waiting for oncotype. Some things that were WORSE than I expected: - my fear the morning of surgery - the pain the first 2 days in the hospital, holy hell! But it did get muted by drugs. - the constipation from painkillers (need to take colase etc and get ahead of it) - some tingling in my hands and head 3after surgery- don't know if it's related. - giving up my normal life and routine for 3 weeks Some things that were BETTER than expected: - the nipple injection of the the nuclear material to locate my SLN 2 hours before surgery - I expected epic pain, it was not much worse than a regular shot in the breast (like what you get before a core biopsy) - getting the drain out a week later was painless - eating after surgery, I got my appetite back and was happy to eat that first week after - the pain after 9 days:- it really subsided after 2 weeks - I was able to get off the oxy and Valium and do Aleve - giving up my normal routine for 3 weeks!  My favorite item was the Ameona Hannah surgical camisole. I bought 2. They are comfy, have drain holders (that can velcro out now) and it zips up the front. Three weeks later, I still wear them everyday. I'm doing ok phyisically, just still reeling and dealing a lot mentally. I know there is more to do, but with this step taken, it feels good to have done something. Hope you are recovering well. Take care of you! And let others help too. I hope you guys are doing well. If you are one week out - keep going and taking care of yourself!!",
