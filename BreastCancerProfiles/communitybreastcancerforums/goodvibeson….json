Then I was allowed to get a mastectomy bra--using puffs, then the firmer 'foams'.  My insurance covered 2 bras and foams from the specialty bra shop. Also, I did get 2 camisole's from the hospital which were both covered by insurance.   So, my advice it so check your insurance and contact your local bra shop that covery mastectomy clothing.   In addition, the button up shirts, pajamas, sweat shirts, etc....are very important to have prior to surgery. Post surgery---make sure you get information on exercises--shoulder and arm exercises.  I am sure the hospital and your bs will give you that information.  I also decided to buy a book specific to recovering from breast surgery that has exercises.  It was very helpful. Good luck. It is good that you are posting and getting information from others who have gone through this.  Take care of yourself! Jean ",

It is horrific to deal with bc and scarey for us.  And it brings up so many issue for our women friends and family! Will they be next?  If someone so close to them can have bc then they can too.  I know since I was one of those people.  I have been open to my work and friends.  I think that has helped me cope.  I work in a high school with over 2300 students and 90 faculty.  I emailed the whole school about my dx and treatment. Told them every surgery etc....(since I had to take medical leave).  The faculty have been very supportive.  I set up a twitter account so I could post updates without having to email family, friends, etc... regularly.  I even have about 6 women friends who I invited on my reconstrutive journey. They have seen my 'boy' chest after the BM, and will see the progression of my recon over the next 3 months.  Sort of weird....but I felt that it was educational for my friends.  Hopefully they would never have to see this with a family member or themselves.... But the process is sort of interesting to me..so offered others to join me along the way. So, I think that I have tried to take the mystery out of bc and be up front with people.  That may be  why my friends make so many remarks, etc... They want me to know that they understand what is going on with me, etc... So, patient I will be...  Have a great day and a good weekend. Jean ",

I am a new member myself.  Wish I would have joined when I was first Dx Oct, 09.  But am really liking the support the past few days.  I would agree with the posting from Elimar regarding the Oncotype Dx test.  My onc ordered it after my bm to help recommmend the next course of tx--chemo or hormone tx.  My results came back with #14 which is in the low risk category.  So, I am just taking femara daily.  Interestingly, though, my first onc probably would not have ordered the test.  I go to Dana Farber in Boston and my first onc went on maternity leave just prior to my bm.  So she referred me to another br onc at Dana Farber.  This woman was so great...I liked her alot more that first dr.  I am still scared about not doing chemo.  The only thing that you need to be aware of for the Oncotype Dx test is that it is expensive and some insurances won't cover all of the cost.  My insurance denied it first, but Dana Farber is sending more info to justify them paying.  I called my insurance prior to the test and they said they pay for the test if the cancer has 5 chacteristics..... My cancer fit all of the 5 specifications.  So, now I just need to make sure it is justified by Dana Farber.  I have really learned how to navigate the insurance issues..... Not easy. I say we all need to celebrate our accomplishments as we go through this physical, emotional, and spiritual journey.  We are strong women who have been faced with a very difficult challenge in life.  However, we are not letting this get us down!  (Well maybe some days are better than others.)  We educate ourselves, reach out for support, look for healing measures to get us through tough times, etc...  Pat yourself on the back for getting to where you are today!",

Maybe it can help, however every woman goes throught their own journey.  I have no regrets with what I have done, though.  I think that is the most important thing to concentrate on during this process. My cancer was not caught in a mamogram.  My gyn found the lump. I was Dx with IDC in Oct, 09.  Bs said would do lumpectomy or mastectomy..whichever I wanted.  Tumor less than 1cm so I was in low risk group.  Decided to do lump. Bs explained that my not get a clean margin and then would need to go back in again.  Remember my thought at that time--no way would I have do that.  If didn't get all the cancer through lump then would get a mast.  So, Nov had surgery and results were not a clean margin.  I will tell you that news threw me almost as much as the Dx of cancer itself.  I had negative nodes, + estrogen, - progesteron, and -Her2. So, after deciding to have a mastectomy on the affected breast I started thinking about a double. My onc was not in favor of doing that. She said that my other breast had no cancer, we could watch it carefully, take tamoxifen, etc...Well, since cancer cells grow 5-8 years before you can detect them 'watching the left breast with mamograms, etc... did not make me feel optomistic that the cancer would be caught.   My bs was wonderful when I talked to him about the bm.  He understood my anxiety and said he would do whatever I wanted. I had my bm in January and was supposed to start recon at the same time.  Ps could not do the TE then, so had that surgery April 7th.   I said goodbye to my breasts in January and haven't been upset about it.  Didn't freak out when I saw my flat chest, either. I am taking some women friends on my recon journey.  Showing them the before....then the process to getting my new boobs.  My bm went well with no complications.  I was back to playing racquetball and exercizing after about 6 weeks.  Out of work for 3 weeks.  My husband has been very supportive. Whatever I have wanted to do he is with me every step of the way.  Nursed me after every surgery! Good luck with your decision. It is very personal.  You will get many woman with all different thoughts and feelings. We have to make our own decisions on this journey. No decision is wrong, just different.  Hope this helps.

That is so terrible. The roller coaster ride is so hard waiting for the results, then to have the wrong information given to you makes it so much worse.  I can't imagine how you are feeing.  I copied your 3 options in my reply since I wanted to respond to each of them: \"The doctor told me I still have 3 options.  continue on the planned schedule, chemo, rads.  Then check to see if everything is gone.  2.  Go back do another re-excision, then chemo and rads.  3. Mastectomy.    The doc said all the cancer is gone, but 3 doctors also told me they doubted they would fine anything in the margin.  He also said this is an unusual case.  any advice anyone\" #1 option---what does your bs mean when he said to check to see if everything is gone after chemo and rads?  I am confused.  The margin was clear after the second layer was taken. Would he go back in again anyway. Or is he concerned that because the first layer had tumors found? #2 if the margin was clear why is he giving you an option to go back for another re-excision. 3.  Mastectomy---did your bs give you an option of mastectomy in the first place?   I don't know how you feel about having a mastectomy. This is a very personal decision, I know.  I will tell you that I have not regreted my decision to have my BM in January. I had a lumpectomy in November and did not have clean margins.  Knew that I was not going to have a re-excision if the first time was not clear.  My bs would do whatever I wanted, though.  Decided to do both breasts cause didn't want to go through anxiety about healthy one in the future.  I have a good friend who is a surgical nurse in breast cancer unit at my hospital. I asked her advice and she said she would have a BM.  I asked about re-excision and why the docs talk to much about that instead of mastectomies. She said since the research does not indicate a better prognosis with mastectomy, the surgeon look towards the least invasive and less chance of complications, etc.. Which of course is a re-excision.  However, this does not take into account the anxiety, extra surgies if clean margin is not found, etc..Anyway--they found 3 tumors in my affected breast--all under 1 cm.  The other breast was clear.  Never bothered me about that.  I guess I was happy that I didn't have to do radiation. (For me, they said I didn't need radiation.  Although I have heard of BM that have had radiation.)  This also helps reconstruction, etc.... But, I only say that this was my journey.  I am not saying that is what you or anyone else should do. I guess you will need to balance the options.  One thing you may want to do is start separate thread regarding re-excision decisions.  I am sure there are alot of women out there that have had to face this terrible decision like you. My thoughts are with you at this time.  It is the hardest decision that you will have to make.  I am so sad for your family--especially your children. This is so hard and scarey for them.  I could just imagine how worried your son was when he saw the door close... It is so good that he shares with you his feelings.  I have 2 older sons (18 and 21) and they are freaked out at times. Your guys are much younger. I realized that sometims I go through the motions and forget to tell my sons what is going on.  Not the major stuff....but follow up apps, etc.. We all get so busy with our own thoughts, worries, etc... that we sometimes forget to check in with our family. Good luck with your onc visit today.  I hope that you can get some answers/help from this appointment.    Meece--Thanks for the info regarding other ladies not getting fills at first post-op app.  I was wondering if I missed something and should have known I wasn't getting a fill.  Docs sure don't understand how worried we get about this stuff.  Solfram--congratulations on being done with chemo. Sorry to hear that you were back in the hospital for a week afterwards, though.  Good you are getting back to going out, etc... You have been through so much.  It is great to not have dr. app, etc... Did you suffer any complications with your stroke?  I hope that they caught it early.  Welcome to this site. I am new also.  My ps said that I could wear any bra now and a puff!  So, I wore my post mast bra with the puff (that I wore 1 month after my mastecomy). After 4 hours I was hurting.  OMG. Took a pain pill, which I hardly EVER do (except post op).  I guess it is better to have my 'boy chest' then to put these darn puffs on!  I will wait a week and try again.   Good my doc did wait for the fill, I guess. I don't have 50 posts yet, so only get 5 per day. So, I am rambling....  Have a great day, ladies. ",

Now you can get some awesome earrings to celebrate your bday!  I am past the 50 (53 in June) but really felt that 50 was a milestone.  Not in a negative way...just sort of weird. But it is different for everyone.  Plus, I wasn't dx until I was 52 (this past October).   Have a great Saturday, ladies. It is finally beautiful weather here in NH so I am going to enjoy the 75-80 degrees.  We had snow this week about 1/2 north of where I live.  Very cold!  UGH. Thank goodness it is going to be nice! ",

I go for my first fill tomorrow.  Have a bunch of questions for ps.  I have been feeling good lately.  I am thankful that I can sleep on my stomach, have most of my arm movement without pain, and very little pain in my chest. Anxious for the first fill. Have a great night, ladies.  Hope you all had a good mother's day. You guys are awesome! ",

But, my surgeon would do whatever I wanted.  It is too bad that the doctor's are not listen to you regarding what you wanted.  It is your body and you have a right to do what you want with it!  Lizziemack-One additional factor to consider in this maze of information is radiation tx.  I thought long and hard about my bi lat versus doing a reexision.  When the lump does not get all the cancer they have to go back in again.  With the lumpectomy you always have radiation. With a bi lat--many people do not need radiation.  (a few do have radation). So, you are not putting your body through radiation if you have a bi lat.  I read that you could not do radiation twice in the same area.  So, that scared me..in case I had cancer in my chest at a later time.  My onc said that it wasn't as cut and dry as that.  But, I just figured it would be better not having radiation.  So, I opted for the bi lat.   I also have a very good friend who is a breast surgury nurse in Boston. I asked her why it seemed that my bs and onc were talking so much about reexision after my lumpectomy. My friend said that most surgeons are going for the least restrictive procedure since the prognosis is the same either way.  However this does not account for the emotional roller coaster that women go through....My friend sees women go through breast surgery for reexision 2, 3, and even 4 times in order to save the breast.  That really threw me for a loop.   Good luck with your decision.
