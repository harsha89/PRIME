My uncle is a dr and told me that we all have a time frame on earth but day to day no one thinks about it. We do. You have to but at the same time you need to live. Your husband is freaking out as we all do in our own way Dealing with this. When I am having a bad day I do something special w my kids. Zoo. Movies. Whatever. To see their joy makes u focus on joy too. Be strong.",
