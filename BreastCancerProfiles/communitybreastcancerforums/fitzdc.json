Due to past history of blood clots Tamoxifen might be a no-go, so looking at AIs. Don't like the thought of these as they are for post-menopausal and I am not.  Strange that I am so worried about stopping my periods when that would happen soon naturally anyway (I am 47).  Need to get over that hump in my head.  PT session was wonderful.  I have been so afraid to touch my' new' breast for fear I would do damage, but the PT wants daily massages (remember I had the lat. dorsi recon) and the massage feels great. The breast became more supple during the procedure - It is on the way to becoming part of a mathcing pair! (still need a nipple, though).  And stretching - can almost reach over my head - just need to keep working on that.  And sleeping - I can finally roll onto my side!!!! Can't yet sleep that way, but getting closer. Have a great day everyone - Teresa",

Now thinking about a lift on the non-cancer side so the breasts match, but then again might wait a few years for that surgery as tired of doctors and such.  And lucky for me, been on Tamox for months now and no horrible SEs - quite tolerable actually.  Worse, is that I have been in PT for a degenerative disc issue.  At first, I felt rather stupid being there - lots of patients learning how to walk after strokes, how to move again after a traumatic event, and I am there because it hurts when I move my head.  But for the past week - and the more I think about it the angrier I get - it seems that my therapist has no plan.  I show up and he says, \"OK - we'll ride the bike.\"  like somehow that will help my neck.  I went along so as not to make waves, but tomorrow I am saying something.  I will ask to see his plan for me, let him know again that this PT is to avoid neck and back surgery, and question the treatment so far.  I have to believe that the Dr. who ordered the PT (3X a week with traction) is being overruled by a 25 year old PT who says 2 times a week with light stretching and biking will work.

Group plans have pre-esisting condition limitations which is where the ensuring you can show past coverage with a 'letter of creditable coverage'  which is a letter that states you were covered for X amount of time and the pre-existing condition was covered during that time.  Well, it all is sorted out. My previous insurance - United, through my previous employer, was very good.  But I quit my job and went onto the same policy but through COBRA, which was very expensive.  I could have switched to my husband's inurance, a group policy - Blue Cross/Blue Shield but it was easier to stay on COBRA for a few months to ensure for continous coverage.  When I switched to the new policy, I sent in that letter of creditable coverage.  The kink in the system was that the letter had no start date for my previous insurace, thus the new insurance provider  had no way of verifying for how long I had had the insurance.  Sure, I should have caught the fact that there was no date but I was so worried about so many other things that I missed it and Blue Cross had to deny based on that. Bottom line is that it will be sorted with a new DATED letter and the bills will be paid by Blue Cross/Blue Sheild My fun for the day was bra shopping.  I went in January after the UMX and was measured as a 38B.  NO WAY !! I had been wearing a 36 B or C for years.  Yes, the fitter said and for years I bet those bras fit poorly.  So after the revision I went bra shopping again (I admit I just went up to Target and found them) and bought some fun bras - 38B.  Got them home and they did not fit.  Today went to Nordstroms and had a fitter, who must have been all of 25, tell me I was a 38D.  NO WAY!!!! But damn if that 38D didn't fit nicely.  No weird bulge under the arm (and after the LD there is a slight bulge), the sides fill the cup and don't spill out the edges.  Still trying to wrap my head around it. ",
