I am not considered for a mastectomy or reconstruction at this time. Being stage IV (brain met only), I need to stay in shape for the combo they put me on. That is still being decided and has to be approved by my government since I have free health care. One of the options being put toward the government is Herceptin/Perjeta/Taxol for me. Seems to be standard though quite often the Taxol gets dropped after a few weeks. In my case, she wants to continue Herceptin since no cancer from the neck down. She is concerned that if she puts me on Herceptin as first line treatment, my government will deny the Perjeta later and she does not want that to happen. If they say no Perjeta if on Herceptin, then she will push for Herceptin/Perjeta/Taxol and drop the taxol after approx 6 weeks. One other thing, any taxol you may get would not be as strong as when your onc was trying to cure you. As stage IV, the chemo given is a lesser dose since you are going to be in treatment for the rest of your life. The goal is to maintain good quality of life while keeping your disease stable or better yet, NED. When you factor in targeted/hormonal therapies, you would not be on chemo necessarily the whole time. There would be SE, but from what I have read from the other Stage IV people, a lot of times they can be dealt with. Good luck with everything.",

My current treatment is also pretty easy for me which is lucky. I have scans this Friday, so hoping I am still NED below the head to stay on the Herceptin/Perjeta combo.

It would even make sense to prescribe a trainer and have actual workout appointments within the treatment plan. Not sure if cancer centres do that, but they should. Would cut down on a lot of hopsital visits. Whether a person is an early stager or later stage like us, that kind of intervention would prove invaluable. I credit the movement as what FINALLY got me not only eating, but enjoying food. I have missed that a lot. My fatigue is better and it was what I needed to finally kick the brain rads fatigue to the curb. If people were able to start moving before SE from treatment surgery or radiation kicked in, these effects would be less. I know from when I was on my previous chemo, no SE from the chemo itself. Just the steroid crash and burn. Once on Herceptin only up until my brain met became a problem, I felt awesome even after chemo and rads 2015/2016.

They go for fifteen minutes and work to get the HR up. I listen to them on an old android phone and usually watch tv at the same time. I can still hear the beat and march in place and get a few shows watched. Alleviates any boredom. Managed an hour today as well. Appetite has increased a lot too so have to make sure not losing weight. Making sure I stay 170 or so. I am a bigger frame girl so don't need to be skinnier. God forbid I should have to eat more, though I would if I had too LOL. Z, glad the cobwebs are becoming clear. Love good news. Heidi, enjoy the dancing.",

I can imagine that feeling and I know receiving news like that can move us back to how we felt being told we were metastatic. I will picture the chemo attacking your cancer and also send thoughts your way. I have no doubt that your exercise will keep you strong and may it keep SE at bay, but sometimes we just gotta sit with things too. Paula, glad you had a good visit with your daughter. I just wanted to report that my CT scans show I am still NED everywhere. Nothing showing in my brain or anywhere else in my body. So thankful for this reprieve and pray the H&P continue working as long as possible. I was not worried about my scans since there was nothing bothering me healthwise. I am so paranoid, had there been anything brewing I would have likely found it quickly. I feel bad reporting this after reading about Shetland, but I know good news can be helpful to all of us. I did manage to be active today. Did 1 mile of Leslie Sansone, walked 20 mins around the block and 20 mins bike. Wanted to get that in before my tooth got pulled. Have had some pain in my mouth and we found a cracked tooth. Nothing wrong with my teeth otherwise which was surprising as my oral care did fall by the wayside while treating my brain met from july to sept of last year. I did cry while he was having to try to work the tooth out but it is not bad now. I even did a walk around the block again and another with Mom after supper just to prove it was no big deal. Not painful now. ",

Shetland, I am so glad we don't have to do high intensity exercise to achieve benefit. I still like moderate for myself. Most intensive I may get is if I crank up the incline on the treadmill for about 30 secs several times through the workout. My heart goes up and stays challenged. I do the same on my exercise bike. I am satisfied with staying 50 - 60 per cent of my max heart rate. I am losing some weight so it must be working. Admittedly, weight loss is not my primary goal. QOL and reduction of fatigue are the primary reasons I am enjoying so much. I also like eating whatever I like as well and having cravings again. I missed those when recovering from the brain radiation. Hope everyone else is having a decent weekend.",

It is the age old thing, we know it is good for us, we know we will feel good, energized, happier BUT it can be so hard to get started. It can be especially difficult if we were on a roll and got sidetracked with illness, appointments and fatigue. I wish our families could understand our fatigue better as well since it is not about just being tired. Fact is, you are doing it anyway as you say most days. That is helping you. Try not to pressure yourself with the run. If it is not possible to run the hill, walk it. Just getting over is an achievement for all we have been through. I remind myself of that all the time when watching people running on the treadmill etc. I do enough to raise my heartrate and go home happy. The more positive feelings will return once some of the fatigue lifts. That is like wearing a 100lb vest and trying not to feel weighed down. Sending hugs your way.",

I can tell you from personal experience that after WBR, I was extremely depressed and fearful and this made recovery more difficult. While DD is with you, I strongly suggest asking for help. Be aware that steroids also can affect mood and you may see some improvement once you are weaned off. Dizziness should subside but if it is an issue, ask about increasing the steroids to ease this SE. Dizziness will subside with that and lots of hydration and rest. Exercise is the next thing to burn off the stress. If there is an exercise bike available, you would feel more stable. I still recommend a social worker, ask for a referral from your onc or even your regular GP. We all support you here but can only offer virtual advice. YouTube also have meditations you can follow. I subscribe to one channel called the honest guys. Just look it up, I listen to these all night. Have not used sleep aids and rarely think about things. Good luck, hope some of my suggestions are helpful. Last thing, you will scared for a bit BUT it does go away to the back of your mind. ",

A live support group or social worker can help a lot While brain mets suck, treatment is much better than it was. Contrary to a lot of scaremongering out there, WBR is a good option to use with our aggressive cancers and should yield a good qol when done. When you are amped up on steroids, the fear is dialed up. I understand your fear, having been through it. Once you are treated and the steroids are done, sleep should return. If you can take one, I still recommend an antianxiety drug to take the edge off. This phase of treatment will pass too. Once your dizziness is gone, start walking again. It helped me a lot, even when I was on them. Endorphins will be good at this point to modulate the fear. I still recommend to walk while listening to music that makes you happy. That is how I am dealing with my progression.",

The steroids are supposed to relieve symptoms of mets until we can be treated. Hopefully when DD gets there, it will help to have someone with you too.",

I actually like doing the shorter sessions of exercise and they do as much benefit as the longer ones.

Ronnie, don't be afraid to break things up smaller if bigger amounts are hard. The small stuff works just as well. 5 or ten minutes several times over a day is just as beneficial. Good luck.

I enjoy t he 8 hour \"gentle sleep talkdown\". You don't have to DO anything much, couple deep breaths and tensing your body. The talking goes for 10 minutes, rain noise for the rest of the time. I use a cellphone and earbuds as they work best. I have also used my laptop that is nearby. Sleep mask keeps out the light. Good luck. Link is below. Hope everyone else is doing well. Z, hope the cannabis works out. Neat that the fitbit can monitor your sleep.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4i53B-y_i2o",

Again welcome. They hilly walk sounds perfect to get the blood pumping. I am sorry you are having skull met issues. Edited my last response as when I reread your comment, you did mention having lesions before. I apologize for my previous response missing that fact. Mae, love that puzzle. If my cats would let me, I would do a puzzle. No other room to do them in. Got a few old Star Wars ones I would love to do. Awesome job at it. Hope your feet improve soon as well. I had a decent day myself. After a few days of punishing rain, got a sunny day today. Managed 20 min walk to enjoy the son, 10 mins on stationary bike and 25 mins on the treadmill at my gym. I am still playing with the incline on the treadmill more than the speed. Given my brain mets issue, not interested in running on the treadmill. I do a brisk walk, hold on the whole time and just add a hill whenever I feel like it. They are getting bigger and bigger. Love it, makes me feel good. Helps the appetite. Great job everyone. ",

My recommendation is go with what she says. She may say she does not care for a while, since you already made a couple of suggestions, wait for her to take you up on it. She will have to grieve since even a lumpectomy can cause a big difference in her appearance. At some point she will most likely come out of it herself and may ask for some help with prosthesis or else getting reconstruction. For now, just listen if she does want to vent about changes to her appearance, be supportive but allow her to decide when she may want to do something about it. If she decides on prosthesis, there is a great site that has knitted prosthetics that are actually more comfortable than the silicone ones. They just fit in the bra and are light and free of charge . I have one myself. The link is below. http://www.knittedknockers.org/",

I had to dial down to about 20 mins instead of the 80 to 100 mins of bike I was doing at that time. Once I slowed down some, I finally started to slow down my draining. Did not think that all that exercise was bad, it probably helped me heal quicker, though the drain was a huge issue for me. Hated the feeling of it. Stuffed it in my bra eventually.

Doing some at gym and some at home. Still approx 40 to 60 mins. Waiting for second MRI to happen in sept or so. They were concerned about nausea/vomiting so this was the first MRI since sept. I believe the spot they found was leftover tumour since it could not all be removed. We will scan again to make sure it does not grow. I personally don't believe it has there is nothing going on in my body. Currently still NED anywhere else. Only had the one met so far. Nausea and vomiting have subsided since I started taking my reflux drug and magnesium along with my breakfast instead of about an hour before. I also added frozen raspberry juices everyday and this keeps my plumbing working they way it should and boosts my reflux drug. Currently not dealing with much other than that. I am still following you guys though even though I'm not posting and am inspired by the people working and moving as much as possible.

I also added a cup of frozen raspberries to my blender with wheatbran as well for the fiber and alkaline properties. The raspberries AND rabeprazole seem to have taken care of my reflux which also may have been a culprit behind the nausea. All I know is I feel good and hope it continues. I will have another MRI in september to make sure the spot has not grown. We now suspect the spot that showed up was where my original tumour was. It was not able to be completely removed during surgery but I believe radiation knocked it out. I have no symptoms now so I don't really see how it could have grown without my noticing it.

It was not a heavy rain and I did invest in a pair of waterproof bluetooth earbuds. Felt good. My onc said a similar thing to me about being very healthy. It's ridiculous when I think about having cancer because I feel better than I have for years between eating better and looking at exercise as part of my overall treatment plan. I had not been this active for years. It has done me well.",

You can see her most recent post within the past month or so on the brain mets. It is difficult not to imagine dying when a brain met (or more) show up, much the same as I would imagine a person would react to progression in the body. The best thing you can do for yourself is take one step at a time. There is no way to simply just relax so worry about one step ahead, then you do whatever is next, and so on. No one can say you won't die someday BUT with treatment, you can go for years and years. None of us can predict how long we have but we can hope for the best and be as stubborn as we can. Do not read statistics etc. Be your own patient. All of us are supporting you now. Try to have hope and ask for help with the dizziness from the onc in the meantime. Hugs out to you and everyone dealing with treatment or progression, including myself.",

Stationary bike and stepper round out my routine. I am the one who likes the short blurbs of exercise, 15 to 20 mins at a time. Sometimes as short as two to three minutes as well. Whatever works. Also wanted to mention got results for my various scans. CT of brain and thorax stable, chest is stable. Abdomen to pelvis were not available as of Tuesday but since have not yet received a call to come back in, will assume that is stable too. Not having any problems with my abdominal area so not too concerned. Happy about my first scan to confirm NED from neck down and that the brain looks good after the whole brain radiation.

A good brisk walk can definitely get the heart going, vacuuming is always a good one. It is more strenuous than people usually think of. Kettle bell is good too. As long as you can manage to boost your heartrate regularly, it will strengthen it. When it comes to it spiking, keep track of it. Laundry makes sense to make it go up since it is strenuous to load/unload clothes. The fact that it went back to 60 quickly is good. You would worry about it more IF you were at rest and it started racing for no reason. Keep it up, sounds like you have the movement down. ",

If you can't get out due to weather, Leslie sansone is great, just look her up on youtube. It's basically marching but you move quick so that will increase your cardio thus increasing your overall energy level. Start with the two or three minute walk then work your way up. She also does 5min and 15 minute miles. I don't bother doing more than one mile at a time. I do repeat the other workouts throughout the day up to approx 30 to 40 mins. The knee lifts included have helped me get my belly flatter. I had the steroid belly for a long time after brain rads. Arm wise, simple hand weights are good. Having said that, if you already belong to a gym or have other exercise equipment, a few minutes several times a day to start ie 5 or 10 and gradually working upwards is a good option too. I have no doubt you will be able to build more stamina for the trip with your son and the trip to Scotland. I always like Leslie Sansone because I found the exercise really improved my energy level quickly and of course it is free. Congratulations on everything as well, and again so glad you could ditch the oxygen tank. I did approx 50 mins of walking throughout today, the walking vids on youtube with Leslie of course. ",

Don't do it if this is only about not holding your friends back. They will run themselves outside of what you do together if they honestly feel they are missing things. I would think just the spending time together is the most crucial thing. But be honest with them. Good luck. Keep us posted, we are happy to have you here.",

I also did 40 mins of the interval training with Leslie Sansone. Will be getting my annual mammo on my one remaining breast tomorrow. Hate the squish but really not too concerned. All things considered, I am sure something would be picked up in my many scans even without the mammo. Will go over results in May. Not too concerned as stated. No lumps or anything I can palpate.

She had similar issues, peed outside the box, eating but losing weight. She was given semintra (spelling is probably wrong) and low protein food. Vet said she probably could have another couple of years of good quality life on this. We can also give her fluids under the skin to make her feel better. I was happy since she is also elderly. She also loves the new food, though it is expensive. Hopefully your vet gets to the bottom of it for Percy too as I know there can be other things that cause weight loss as well. Fingers crossed for you and Percy. Hope he can feel better soon so you can as well.",

You probably still are dealing with tissue expanders being filled, that is also taxing too. These things alone can account for fatigue. I cannot say I have never heard of an early stage cancer being found later to be advanced. It can happen. In no way am I stating that is the case with you, but it is a very good idea to mention the fatigue and your concerns to your doctor looking after you. If you don't have an oncologist, go through whoever is taking care of your breasts or even a family doc. Keep an open line of communication and if you feel you need it, keep up on scans.",

You may be put on steroids, though if you do not have brain swelling, you could probably wean off sooner. Biggest SE's are fatigue, nausea while getting. The fatigue will last a couple of months, rest a lot. Get ranitidine for stomach protection. Since you are not having neurological issues ie headaches, seizures etc, you should have good results. Normally, those issues can get worse before getting better. I did not have any issues, so treatment was doable. There may be some short term memory loss. My experience a couple months out is that it no different than chemo. Making lists makes all the difference. If your onc thinks this is needed, it is worth considering. Better than waiting for lesions to possibly show up and cause neuro issues. FYI, please do visit Brain Mets Sisters. A few of us have had WBR with good results.

WBR is a fairly hot button topic, there are those of us who support it, those who do not. A lot of articles will say it is heavy handed. My feeling is that not enough good results are reported and there is a great deal of fear. I had the same fear myself, but would have kicked myself as well if I did not do it and got more mets sooner. There are no guarantees on anything. You could ask RO about hippocampus sparing radiation and/or taking the alzheimer drug Namenda which is clinically shown to lower the possible cognitive decline with few SE's. I think you will have some good questions for you RO/MO, I totally see why they want to do it between the Her2 and the lung cancer. It would be a good chance to lower the odds of mets. Good luck with whatever you decide. I also know that some considerations have to do with what OHIP will cover. Glad you trust your team. I trust my MO as well to know what would be best given the likelihood and risk of future mets based on your dx. Some of the advice offered by others may have added more for you to ask about, that is always good. Re the hair not growing back, it can and usually does grow back. See recent picture of SusaninSF on the brain mets thread, link is below. Though there is a small risk of it not coming back full or at all, to say it WON'T grow back simply isn't true. https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/8/topics/777599?page=166 ",

To answer your question, once you are Stage 4, the cancer is not curable. This does not mean she cannot have a decent life BUT it is important to know it won't be cured. She will be treated for cancer for the rest of her life. I know this is scary to hear, especially since she is facing the unknown. How she does will depend on different things. Are there any other mets from the neck down, if not, she could recover and live pretty normally. She will likely be given drugs to control the cancer even if she becomes cancer free after the surgery and or radiation. If she is able to, she should consider some exercise before, during and after. This can help burn off stress and improve her fatigue. It also helps aid recovery from surgery and radiation. I don't mean to infer she should not expect a good life, surgery and radiation can offer a lot of hope for a fairly normal life. She should do her best to avoid googling too much initially. This site is quite helpful ad she won't land in brain cancer sites. Brain cancer may have some similar treatments but it is different and much scarier. I was diagnosed last summer with a brain met. I went through surgery, whole brain radiation. I have not had any other met since it was removed. It does take a long time to recover BUT I feel better now than I have in 2 years. I am at the gym at least 5 days a week. I still have my drugs every three weeks but they do not trouble me. I hope to continue a long time. If you have questions, feel free to message me. ",

Different reasons for me, treatments etc, but same result as you have. The main thing I would recommend is some light exercise (if you can do it). Sometimes just moving, whether it be a walk or some other form of exercise you may like can help. Even 5 or 10 minutes can really clear the cobwebs and may help a lot with fatigue and help build some endurance so standing should not be as hard. Unfortunately, treatment can do this for a while, even after you are done. I would also recommend lots of protein as well, to give you something to fall back on. Good luck with everything and hope it will lift soon. ",

It is unfortunate, but if a chemo is not working, then her onc would want to try a different chemo, even if it was OK for her to handle side effect wise. The reason is that if it is not working, they want to make sure they can get something to keep new mets away or shrink them down. This is the way it can be with stage 4. The goal is that we want to be on a particular treatment as long as possible. Scans tell us if treatments are working, if not, we are put on a different treatment. This can happen a bunch of times. Sometimes the cancer outsmarts the treatment or even changes hormone/HER status. This is very hard to do for sure. I wish you the best. Make sure you also ask the onc about changes in treatment to get all the information you and your Mom need as well so you are fully briefed. Good luck to you both.",

I was found to be cancer free from the neck down. I was not scanned because I had symptoms. This is something my cancer clinic does routinely. I would not specifically worry about your situation being ominous because your MO wants to give a bone scan. Regarding risk of leukemia and bone scans, ask your MO about any specific concerns, what the chances are etc. I would not presume to try to unravel that information. Now, I know you see that I am stage 4 BUT this was because I had a brain met that was too small to see on initial dx. All the chemo I got would not pass the Blood-Brain barrier. My systemic treatment in 2015 was successful due to no mets from the neck down.",

Things that are common if recurring would be things like pain that does not go away after a couple of weeks, fatigue to the point that you cannot think straight or function. When it comes to brain issues, looking for things like falling down, sudden weakness in the the legs, vision problems are the most likely factors. I would not be surprised that your busy lifestyle plus having already having been though cancer treatment contribute to your fatigue. Mention it to your family doctor unless you are still being followed by an oncologist. Check what your eating, hydrate and to fight your fatigue, exercise if you do not already do so. Even if it involves walking a few times a day if you don't like long distances. It would not take long to benefit and is one of the easiest ways to improve our energy level.

Good luck with everything. It certainly is a tough time.",

I can attest that chemo plus Herceptin gives an excellent chance to avoid recurrence or metastasis at a later date. The only reason I am stage IV now is that Herceptin and chemo could not cross the blood/brain barrier and I had cancer in my brain that was too small to see upon my initial diagnosis. However, I am fortunate to be disease free from the neck down which does improve my chances at recovering for a long time. That is definitely due to the chemo plus Herceptin. In my case I had the AC plus T since I was considered Stage III at dx. Unless she medically cannot do the chemo/Herceptin, I would highly recommend it. Side effects can be dealt with fairly easily medically and there are always good complementary ways to deal with side effects too. Good luck with whatever she decides. Ultimately she must choose what she can live with. I hope the best either way.",

I had seen the first one and was disappointed not to see other posts in there. I believe both the realistic and hopeful aspects of MBC can coexist. I also agree that only having people who are doing many things can make others feel that they are not good enough, if they can only just make it through another day (which is amazing by the way). All facets of this disease need to be included, not just for stage IV but for all stages of BC. Make it more realistic.",

      "Content": "Aug 22, 2018 10:17PM - edited Aug 22, 2018 10:17PM by mara51506 I am so sorry you had to join us in Stage IV. The first time you are told that it is a punch in the gut and scary. First thing to know, your family is in shock as much as you are. You will find ways of dealing with emotions. I am glad you found us here. This is a great place to ask questions and also talk with like minded people going through something similar. It will allow you to get out any of your darkest thoughts that might scare your family. I found a social worker helpful in framing my thinking about how some of my family handled things. I used to get upset at my younger brothers family as I did not think they cared. We do not see each other much BUT after the social worker explained some people cannot deal with it, it is better to allow them space. Less stress for you and easier to come together later. Time will also blunt the fear. The other thing is to tell your family what you need from them to help you. You also can be a help to your family by letting them know you are still here and interested in their lives too. I found that I lived in cancerland and constantly talked about it, not giving much thought to other people's lives. I actually found it less stressful listening to what was happening. I listen to meditation music in my earbuds at night while I sleep. Keeps me calm and not having to wake up about cancer. If you still feel healthy, tell your family you are living with cancer. Don't frame it as I am dying from cancer as this will make treatment feel even more difficult for you. It can also be something that is helpful to them as well. If they say they want to help, give them things that can help you like help housecleaning, organizing bills or something. They will appreciate you allowing them to help. A lot of what I am saying comes with time, the online support here is great and if you need it, I am sure your cancer center can give you locations of support groups. I have been dealing with cancer a long time and a lot of this took a couple of years. Cry if you need to whenever you need to and lose stress, don't allow a doctor to say too much about prognosis and don't bother with the survival stats. Let your family know that for now, you are still here and carry on as normally as possible. Stay active if you can as well, great stress buster and helps make any side effects of ongoing treatment smaller. Good luck, you can message me anytime. I may not be triple negative but I am still living with cancer and having a good life.",

Then it was found to be Stage 3 meaning chemo and radiation. I am still in treatment, getting Herceptin every 3 weeks until September. I want you to know this is my first post and I wanted to tell you that this forum is AMAZING support, even if you don't post you can read something that may have helped someone. It will take a long time to digest everything you are being told and definitely you want to have someone with you. Notebook is a must. Write down any question that may pop into your head. Do not consult google for survival stats or scare yourself looking up different things online. Trust you onc and if you don't like that one, get a second or even third opinion. You will feel may things as you go along, all of which are normal. Ask people directly for help. ie \"Can you make dinner, pick up kids, clean house etc\". People will want to help, it is easier if they know. Most of all, get help from an antianxiety/antidepressent if it becomes necessary. I am only a year out from my initial diagnosis and am still dealing with things. Best of luck. Everyone here is wonderful and I have been helped even just by reading different topics depending on which phase of treatment I was in. I know I have missed a lot but wish you all the best with everything. Hugs. One day at a time.",

I have read this all the way though and think we should stop responding to her. If she is anxious, of course she should get help but I do believe she enjoys us responding, even if it is just to say get help elsewhere go away. Ignoring her would be the best thing to do. Obviously the topic will not go elsewhere. Mods, I do wish you would close this thread somehow since it is not bc related. She either has an anxiety disorder which needs different supports than us or needs this thread closed as it is distressing to OUR members.",

Eg bone Mets can be painful, liver Mets can be painful etc. I would recommend the Stage 4 boards, there is one for bone mets, liver Mets. Lots of those ladies have been going for years, some are still working. I am sorry you are with us but lots of good support here   ",
