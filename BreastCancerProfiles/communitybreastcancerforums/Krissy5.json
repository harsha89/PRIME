He also said I won't be so sick that I'll need family to come out and stay with me during treatment.  I'm looking at doing a TCH chemo treatment cycle every 3 weeks.  Can you tell from the first infusion how your body will react to the treatment or does it get better/worse over time?  How much support have you needed?",
