Yes, I have moved very quickly on this as I do with everything else in life.  Always better to be safe then sorry and be strong about anything in life and take the bull by the horns and just do what we must do.  Thank you so much for your response Leaf!  I hope to come back with a B9 diagnosis...  Hugs! ",

I would appreciate any thoughts on my situation.  Do you think this time around it sounds more likely to be cancer?  I'm so scared that it might be.  Log in to post a reply",
