I found something online yesterday that talked aobut the emotions of cancer--almost identical to grief of loss. Anger, sadness, depression, etc. I was feeling similarly last week, and Theresa wrote one of her many inspiring e-mails in response. If you can make an attempt to do something for yourself, it may help pull you out of your funk. I had tea with my best friend and felt elated. But if you're not ready for people yet (and I DO understand that), maybe go for a drive, or a little walk, or stop at Starbucks for a favorite beverage. Today it's rainy here so I'm going to the bookstore to research hummingbird gardens. Sometimes it's just so hard to take the first step because you're a tangled web of emotions (anger, sadness, resentment, etc.), but once you do it's one step in front of the other. Try to do one small thing out of the house today and let us know if it helps. P.S. My sister-in-law texted me a few days after my treatment and asked what was the most difficult thing. I snidely replied \"Having Cancer!\" Not up for repeating every little detail of discomfort. And, while I know her intentions are good, I don't need daily texts asking how my day was. Hugs, Sue",

I'm not huge on NY's Eve, but I'm going to celebrate this one with gusto with our best friends. Ginger - you are right. I believe mid-50's is a very common age for BC. Not sure if it's because of menopause or what. Anyway, in the meantime, my DH and I took his wedding ring in to get it sized. I spotted a fabulous wedding band that totally matched my engagement ring that I had redone several years back. So, I figured after all I've been through, what's $1500 for a new ring, right? I do think I deserve it (although I certainly don't need it). And, as I've mentioned, I'm apprehensive to schedule a vacation since I've had to schedule 2 recently due to medical problems, including my BC. Hugs to all, Sue",

Special K had a great explanation a short while ago. Here's a clip from what she said: Aromatase inhibitors work by suppressing estrogen, but not estrogen that comes from your ovaries. Rather, the rationale behind using it for post-menopausal women is that you are no longer making estrogen in your ovaries and these drugs inhibit the enzyme aromatase which converts androgens from your adrenal glands into estrogen. So, taking an AI drug if you are premenopausal would negate the estrogen converted from androgens but would not suppress the estrogen made in the ovaries, and therefore offer no protection.",

My husband came down with an infection in his artificial knee last summer. Had to give him infusions through his PICC line twice a day for 2 months. I was scared at the prospect, but managed just fine after just one visit from the visiting nurse. Actually, it was kind of fun. I sometimes had to administer while on a conference call. If you have no one to help you, you can do it yourself, you just need a little extender to make the PICC line longer. Don't be too down about it. And I think you can do just about anything with the PICC except, perhaps, swim. Have a good Sunday, everyone.",

I'm no Dr but it seems that with your very early detection and aggressive treatments, it's unlikely you have mets at this point. And I don't think bone cancer causes muscle spasms. Most likely a tight muscle and/or pinched nerve. Please try to enjoy the weekend and talk to your Dr on Monday. Big hugs to you, Addie!",

About 18 days after my first infusion, I realized that if I were on any other regimen I would be shaving my head. It's incomprehendable to me--it must be totally devastating. My deepest respect to all of you. My question is: did your MOs give you any \"choice\" of regimen or did s/he tell you what regimen you were to receive? It seems most folks are on TC or AC. I get 6 treatments (other CMF'ers receive 8), but they are not as harsh. Just curious as to why more folks aren't taking CMF. I realize it's an older regimen but, to my knowledge, just as effective (at least for early stage cancers). Have a great week ahead!",

Following an Oncotype Score of 20, I am awaiting the results of the Mammaprint test. If it comes back high risk, it's a done deal. If it's low risk, I'm feeling that perhaps I should take it anyway, since the Onco score and KI-67 = 20 are both intermediate. Anyone else have to \"decide\" what to do based on intermediate scores?

My score was a 20 - shoot, of course it fell in intermediate, which really means there isn't enough data to discern what should be done. So then I had the Mammaprint test done, which only assigns a low or high risk. Mine came back high. While still trying to get out of chemo, I asked my Dr. what he would have prescribed before the genomic testing. He said \"I would prescribe chemotherapy since your tumor is bigger than 1 cm.\" So damn--I couldn't fight him any more and proceded to have CMF chemo, which causes hair thinning but not hair loss and is easier to tolerate. 2 months post final chemo, it's a bit of a distant memory already. I do know that I'm glad to do it, though, as you only have one shot at it. Hope you are happy with your upcoming treatment plans.  Sue",
