She has been great but wants to see my wife weekly and we aren't able to do that during chemo as well. Unfortunately, my wife has developed cording on her left side, we are still hoping to avoid LE, but have heard that cording isn't a good sign. Does anyone know anything else we can do? We are trying to be careful.",
