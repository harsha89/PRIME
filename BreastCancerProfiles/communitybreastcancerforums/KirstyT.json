The doctor never said where i would be referred to, just that i needed to get it checked out and it would take a couple of weeks before i got an app. There's a history of breast cancer in my family. 2 of my aunts had it previously. One was early 30s and didnt survive and the other beat it in her 40/50s. I dont have contact with this side of my family. Just a bit worried as I feel in the dark. The doctor didnt give me much info on what was to happen next! Thanks Log in to post a reply",

I just got a letter today from the breast clinic for an app in 2weeks and possibly a mammogram and a needle biopsy depending on their examinations. Yea, the waiting part is terrible. Thanks for the advice guys. Really appreciate it.",
