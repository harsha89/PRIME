I decided over a year ago to full fill my dream in becoming a RN. After finding out that I am Stage IV in October of last year, I was devistated ( like all of you) and my dream shattered right in front of me. After lots of sleepless nights and talking to my dear boyfriend he said not to give up on that dream. Even if my life might be cut short it might not be too short to still become a RN and to full fill my dream. Now here is my dilemma: Working full-time at a job that I don't like and going to school has become very hard. I would love to go to school full-time, but I need insurance and of course money to live. Is anybody on disability and goes to school full-time? I am so unhappy in my current situation and I am looking for some ideas!  Thank you for your input...and as always..I am so happy I found all of you wonderful friends..

Switching to GEMZAR and Caroplatin, Herceptin. Is anyone on this treatment? How are the S/E? My onc is hoping that the new TDM-1 is approved soon..he believes it will be a great treatment. Another question...my pain gets so severe sometimes at night..that even a Vicodin won't help! I hate narcotics..is there any pain medication that helps better than others? Hugs to all of you..!

I love my mom dearly but for example when I had my overies removed she said..\"great, that will kill the cancer and watch it ...you will be cured!\" Or she says, you must be feeling great since I don't complain or because I don't talk about the cancer. As you know...we might not talk about but sure think about it 100 times a day. It takes alot to keep it together ALL THE TIME and have the right attitude ALL THE TIME...and then I see people at work who get so upset because they didn't reach their sales goal for the week ( I work in staffing)..and I think to myself..what's a stupid sales number compared to having a terminal illness..!!! But those are all thoughts I don't share with nobody! Sorry for venting...but YES I believe in having a good attitude, I don't like to be miserable...but the cancer is still there!",
