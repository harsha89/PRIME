They may have to do a biopsy to make sure it is not BC. Been there. Done that. Doctors usually take a laid back position. Although it is not their body, the fact remains that someone has to be calm. Just don't push the panic button.  Try to remain calm for your child and family. Enjoy your child. Children pick up on stress. Think positive and stay busy and productive as you wait. ",
