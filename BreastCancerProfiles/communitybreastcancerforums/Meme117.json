My tumor is just over 2 cm so puts me at stage 2. It's been almost 2 weeks and the reality of my \"new\" life is just setting in. Each day brings new info and new doctors. The major shock for me is the need for chemo and all the lovely side effects, this being due to her+. I have found this site the bestest for info and support, I'm all about being prepared.

Will do a trial run next Friday, really. I just want to get it done. I guess a whole week doesn't matter in the grand scheme but for me and my life, I want to be done. The skin care instructions I received are to use lindy, eucerin or aveeno cream. Apply 2-3x/day, apply nothing 4 hrs before treatment and use a mild soap such as dove. I was told to try not to mix lotions as if there is a reaction they will know what cream. RO said some people have a reaction with aquaphor. Someone on this site recommended emu oil and vit e cream. I have aquaphor ready to go and the emu oil. I was told by the nursing staff to stop taking vit a,c and e, so I'm not sure about using vit e cream. I need to find out more info about vitamin interaction. There is a good video online that shows the radiation procedure www.rtanswers.org And I love the photo from Connecticut so beautiful what a wonderful hike.",

I'm down 4 out of 33, my boob is red already and I'm tired. Rads so far is not as hard as chemo. Chemo was 18 of TCHP with herceptin till April every 3 weeks. The SEs were tough from hairloss, eye issues, major body pain and more and others have it worse. I agree that due to the actual sessions in which friends and family come with and provide comfort it felt less vulnerable than radiation. I wish my chemo place had TVs and gave out drinks.
