I know fibroadenomas can cause breast pain. I finally gave up coffee, which is not easy, and the pain has subsided. Just a tip, in case you were having pain too. Hope all goes well! Curly Girl ",

The New Earth and The Power of Now. Both are written by Ekhart Tolle. I don't know if they will help you, but they help me to focus on the present and not worry about the future or the dwell on the past. Some days since my diagnosis I still feel anxious but not like I did before. I also like the website crazysexylife.com. If I could go back in time before BC, I would have changed my diet and gotten more exercise in my 30's. I was never overweight so I wasn't concerned with what I ate and I ate 100% processed foods and lots of sugary foods too.  Another helpful book is How to Fight Cancer and Win by William Fischer which talks about the importance of diet and focuses on the Budwig Diet as both preventative and a cure for cancer. I know there is so much literature out there but the books I've mentioned were given to me by 2 cancer survivors. Just try not to let the anxiety ruin your present life.",

It could not be felt and was only found through a mammogram and sonogram and dx through fine needle biopsy. I also have small breasts and I was dx with bc in August after a routine mammogram showed microcalcifications and biopsy confirmed bc. The tumor was very small and the drs could not feel it through exam. I think you should just find a dr who will follow you closely and don't wait until you're 40 for your next check up.  You may also want to make healthy dietary changes and avoid processed foods and try to exercise.",
