I don\u2019t no if this helps at all but I went to see my GP on the 22nd Aug as I had found a lump under my right breast. The GP referred me to the breast clinic at the hospital, I was seen Tuesday just gone. When I got there the breast surgeon examined me and sent me for a ultrasound scan I was then told I would need a core biopsy which they did there and then. I get my results on the 14th sept .",
