How do you keep the bras from shifting up when there are no breasts at all?  I know someone out there has a good answer for this. What keeps the bra in place? Please share.

I also started that \"Should I fire my oncologist?\" topic. I went to my second opinion onc on 3/5/2010, he recommended Carboplatin and Taxotere every 3 weeks x 6. He also recommended a PET scan because I have never had one. I had CT and CAT scans of whole body and they were negative in 2006 and 2009 but he wants to be on the safe side. Can you have negative CT and CAT and have a positive PET? I thought I was finished with scans.(waiting for results) he says that this 3.5cm TNBC is considered large to him, and he doesn't want to take any chances with it. I need to know what side effects I should expect. I would like positive and negative feedback please. I haven't gone to first opinion onc yet because appt was postponed because of snow storm, so I am seeing her on 3/8/2010. (reverse order) Second opinion onc did say that the A/C regimen I was on did not fail in 2007, because if it had, the recurrence would have been distant. He thinks the rads failed, because it came back in the same breast. He really doesn't feel the first onc did anything wrong other than not ordering PET scans for me. Especially since I am now a three time cancer survivor. First one was er/pr+ in 2005. I need to start chemo within the next two weeks he says, and I need a port and the PET. I don't have long to make a decision about onc 1 or onc 2. I'll let you know what first onc says on Monday.  Talk to me today. Tell me what you think.
