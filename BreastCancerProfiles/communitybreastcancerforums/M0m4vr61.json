Should I expect this to be more painful? I should have asked the surgeon but I didn't. I should be getting a mammo soon and then providing that is okay then the ducts removed.

      "Content": "M0m4vr61 wrote: Hi Everyone, I am currently 54 years old and I have had unilateral, spontaneous, one duct, clear discharge in my L breast for over three years (every day rain or shine). Three years ago I saw a surgeon and she was 98% sure it was just fibrocystic. At the time I had a small dimple to the left side of my nipple on the areola. She just wanted to take out the ducts after a mammo showed nothing. I had no ultrasound. I just didn't feel comfortable with her so I opted to do nothing. I went to get a normal mammo a couple weeks ago and they wouldn't do it since I was still having the nipple discharge. So today I saw another surgeon, he saw the dimpling in my areola before I laid down (which is much worse than 3 years ago). I also have dimpling skin off to the side of the areola (where the dimple on my areola is) too which he didn't even see because like I said he just went straight to laying me down and palpating & squeezing my nipple. I was so shocked that he didn't even look at my breasts (hold my hands over my head, etc. - you know a proper exam) I didn't say anything. Yes, I am an idiot - I should have shown him where the skin also puckered in. He then said that the dimpling areola didn't really bother him too much. He says that if this has been going on for 3 years he should find a lump which he did not. He wants me to get a mammo and then he wants to do surgery to remove all the ducts in that breast. He said he might take a little extra out where the areola dimpling is to make sure it isn't anything. I don't know about any of this. I have always had very dense breast & have had 3 biopsies which were fibroadenomas. My first at 14 which was 5x7cm in L breast; my second at 31 in R breast, and the final one at age 45 which was also in my L breast (it was also a fast grower & rather large). Does anyone have a similar story and it just turned out to be nothing? He suspects a papilloma which would be no big deal. Should I get a second opinion or just wait to see what the mammo shows? Thanks for anything you can share. I really appreciate it!!!!! Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Jan 13, 2016 04:57PM - edited Jan 13, 2016 04:58PM by M0m4vr61 Thanks so much for your replies. I had a mammo and 2 ultrasounds today. They didn't find anything but a couple of dilated ducts so there was nothing to biopsy. The surgeon still thinks I should have the ducal excision. The radiologist said that sometimes they do find a tiny cancer even when the mammo and ultrasound are clear. Since both tests came out negative I feel better and everyone I know says get the surgery because this has been going on too long. I guess I just need to bite the bullet and know for sure. I am so over my boobs!! I hope your surgery went fine  ",
