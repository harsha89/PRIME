Two years ago is when I found out I have very dense breast. Four different biopsy this past Friday. Tomorrow is the day of truth. I have cluster of califications. One they are concerned about yet was told they have seen the same from others and came back B9. I pray this for me and others. I am to deploy to Iraq with reserves. I want to deploy for several reasons. There are moments not around my husband where a few tears will fall and then other times I feel God has healed me. Thanks for listening. Denise",
