      "Content": "HeatherAP wrote: I'm 33 and first noticed a lump in my right breast in January 2017. I ignored it because; 1. I was in denial that I found anything and 2. I was recently diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis and CREST Syndrome so I didn't want to add another 'problem' to my list. I finally went to my doctor mid-July and she immediately referred me out to have a mammogram completed. About 10 minutes after my mammogram I was asked if I had time to complete an ultrasound. Of course I stayed and had the ultrasound. After the ultrasound I was asked to stay yet again...the on call doc wanted to speak with me. A solid lump was found and there was no way for him to be 100% certain that my lump was a fibroadenoma (he is hoping that's all it is based on my age). I go in for a biopsy tomorrow and I'm a nervous wreck. I'm not nervous about the procedure...its the possible results that freak me out. Any words of wisdom or advice? If the biopsy comes back clean....what's the next step? Do biopsies ever get 'misread' or 'misdiagnosed'? I have so many questions.... Log in to post a reply",
