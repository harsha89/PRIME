The last time I had a mammogram I was 37 yrs old.  Then, I was told I had a lot of fatty tissues-if my memory serves me correctly. Trust me, I will never let time lapse again between mammograms. These last couple weeks have drove me completely crazy. Waiting on test results. Mammogram results Radiologist 1- on 11/12/10 Stated moderate density with a 7-8 millimeter nodule near nipple in left breast; recommended spot compression and ultrasound.  Didn't meet this radiologist results were sent to my doctor's office. Radiologist 2- Today 11/26/10, stated that the area is very dense and she (radiologist-2) couldn't say if it is a nodule or not-not sure what it is at this point; She said the spot compression detected the area of concern and its very dense; and the ultrasound didn't show anything;  I asked to see the radiologist and she had such a unconcern attitude like I was bothering her or something. She recommended I return in 6 months to see if it's still there-this is something they like to watch for at least 2 years. Another thing, the ultrasound technician was in distressed while performing my ultrasound test because her son had been beaten and robbed 40- 45 minutes prior to me having my ultrasound done. So, she wasn't too focused and I can understand that-too. Please advise as to what I should do? I plan to tell my GYN that I'm not pleased with the results. I feel like I'm getting 2 different answers and I'm still a nervous wreck at this point. Am I over re-acting? God knows I'm concerned-this is my health. I've read too many stories where radiologists blew patients off and they were later diagnosed with breast cancer. Log in to post a reply",
