I get my treatment on Fridays, and Saturday's I have a terrible headache, sunday, Monday, Tuesday, nausea and fatigue. Wednesday, I start to feel like I can eat again. I am going this Friday for the first treatment of cycle 2. My hair is thinning out for sure. I wonder when it will come out in clumps? Can anyone provide their experience with that? Also, I am wondering how many cycles your docs have you on? I am so clueless how many I will need to have. Wishing everyone more energy!",
