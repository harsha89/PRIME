I never thought for one moment I would ever find myself in this situation . I can almost understand when people make these dumb statements , I probably made them too. It's not that I didn't have sympathy for their situation , I simply didn't understand the difference between the different stages and what mets meant. Now I find myself having to explain to ppl that I've got terminal cancer . There is no cure. Only those who \"get it\" will regularly contact me to find out how I'm really doing, the rest have slowly started disappearing. I think they're more afraid than me.",

It's like this can't possibly be happening to me. Then I realise that it's happening to my loved ones too. It's happening to my 12 year old . In the beginning when I was just dx with Stage 4 , I thought of writing letters to my family, especially my son. Then I decided that I will not reach from beyond the grave and upset him every significant birthday or occasion (just my opinion) I will spend as much time and make as many wonderful memories as possible. Besides , for me it's kinda like giving up and that scares me. Hang in there and make sure you rest and get your strength back. I'll be thinking about you .",
