Kris -- I tried to go without the AC drugs (ativan, compazine and zofran) on the first round of Taxol...big mistake!  I quickly got back on that wagon and fared much better.  I find that these meds are what gives me the bowel issues.  So, yes, I did take my miralax as usual.  As a note, I found I didn't need the meds as long as with AC.  Hopefully, you will find you can back off a day or two.  You will need an ample supply of Motrin (or whatever your onc suggests for bone pain and aches) and Tylenol.  Will you be getting the neulasta shot the day after?  If so, you really want to stay regular with the ibuprofen.  Don't forget to take (provided your onc says it's ok) an allergy pill every day, like clairitin or zyrtec (now otc).  Good luck! Will check in later - have a great day all! Tina ",

Dh took care of adding new edging and trimming the pine trees.  By Sunday afternoon we were exhausted.  Luckily the weather held out the entire time. I've got exchange surgery at 8:30 tomorrow morning.  Am looking forward to getting this done.  I took the week off work, and am happy to have the extra time to get some things done.  Ds #2 will have graduation commencement exercises in two weeks.  We'll be having an open house for him later in June, but, wanted to get his invitation/announcements ordered.  Dh took him to a park today and took a few outdoor pictures of him in front of Minnehaha Falls.  They turned out really nice, so, we'll use that pic for the invitation/announcement. On Thursday, dh and I are heading north to our favorite place, Grand Marais, on the north shore of Lake Superior for a little getaway.  We haven't been anywhere for so long!  Even if I'm still recovering, it'll be nice to be away.   Julie -- Glad to hear your surgery went well.  Take care! Hope you're all well.  Will be lurking for the next few days. Have a good evening, Tina ",

We, too, have had cloudy grey days most of the week.  Had quite a storm last night, with hail and heavy rain.  Second one of the week.  Haven\u2019t had a need to water the garden.  In between rain drops I checked the it tonight, actually have some lovely strawberries, my herbs are going bananas and the pepper plants have many flowers.  Not much happening with the tomato plants yet, probably not hot or sunny enough, yet.  I smiled in reading back through the posts how the topic of berries in the garden brought back pleasant childhood memories for some.  Kimberly \u2013 Sorry for the late shout-out.  I knew today was your day and having been sending good wishes your way.  Looking forward to hearing back from you when you\u2019re up to it. Julie \u2013 Great pics!  Looking good!  What a beautiful smile. Carol \u2013 Hoping your bad tummy is getting better.  Congrats to dh on the new job.  I\u2019m glad that it\u2019s happening at a better time in your lives.  Two months ago would have been the pits.  Carla \u2013 All the best to you today, too!  The last one!!  YAY!!  Good luck on the relay tonight! Paula \u2013 I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve had the energy and time to update us on dh.  I\u2019m praying that the study will benefit him.  As others have said, he couldn\u2019t be in a better place.  That in itself is a blessing.  Very positive!  Best wishes continue to you and your family. D1 \u2013 Sounds like you\u2019re going to have a houseful this weekend.  Glad the painting went well and you\u2019re happy with it.  I\u2019m starting to eyeball things around here too\u2026we\u2019ve got a graduation open house to host in a couple weeks.  I liked your comment about travel vs. \u201cstuff\u201d.  I\u2019m with you\u2026but, haven\u2019t been abroad before.  Good luck on the walk tomorrow! Wishing you all a good Friday evening. Tina This is ds #2, John.  Mr. Graduate.  The green ribbon is in memory of a classmate, a boy John has known since elementary school, who was killed while a passenger on a \"crotch rocket\" motorcycle.  He and the boy who was driving had to make a hard stop, they both were thrown.  The boy who was killed wasn't wearing a helmet.  The driver, another friend from elementary school was in critical condition for over a month.  He was at the graduation last night, in a wheel chair, still looking pretty banged up.  The parents of the deceased boy were there to accept their sons' diploma.  It broke my heart.  They were so brave and sweet walking up to the podium, the Mom was sobbing and trying to be so strong, waving at all of her boys' friends.  All of the students stood and applauded.  It was really moving.  My heart goes out to the boy who survived the crash.  I am worried about his mental and emotional health as much as his physical health. ",

Dh is off to Denver this week for work, also doing a little house hunting.  Our move plan has resurfaced now that chemo is over and our lives are becoming more and more normal.  I am excited to try something new, but, absolutely despise moving.  Luckily our company will be paying for our move, so we'll be able to engage a moving company to help with packing and all the heavy lifting.  Ds #1 actually has a plan for himself, following his month-long hiatus with the NOLS program in northwestern WA state.  He's decided to move to Colorado to be closer to his best friend and girlfriend.  He's going to community college in the fall to take the Wilderness First Responder course, which will allow him to get a job as a ski patrol in the winter, and a whitewater river rafting guide in the summer. Totally right up his alley. Ds #2 is formulating some plans of his own.  He's looking for a small apartment very near where he'll be attending technical college this fall.  I'm going to go with him tomorrow afternoon to have a looksee.  His independence is surprising and comforting.  I was worried about him staying back here to finish his two-year program, while we may be out in Colo.  The good news is he has my folks here, his father is here and plenty of friends.   One last note, the little wiener dog we were looking at ended up getting sold!  So, I'm casually shopping again...found another breeder in northern Iowa. Gotta go and catch the end of the longest stage of the tour (232 km), Stage 5, Cholet to Chateauroux.  Dopers be damned!! Thinking of you all, have a great evening. Tina ",

As you can expect, I've been getting on with life. Keeping busy with work, getting DS #1 packed up and moved out to Colorado, getting DS #2 packed up and moved as well. We are now officially empty nesters! It's a little weird. Here are the stories: DS #1 finished two years at community college, which left him with a 2-year degree, but, no where close to figuring out what he wants to do (SISKimberly...I know your boy has been down this road). I don't know if you'll remember that he's the one that attending the NOLS program for a month last summer. That is a national outdoor leadership school, teaching outdoor skills (kind of like Outward Bound), up in the North Cascades in WA (Carol's neck of the woods). He's my outdoor boy, having learned to ski at age 2, rock climbing, backpacking, hiking, you get the idea. Anyway, he followed his girlfriend and best friend out to Colorado, where he's landed a job working at Winter Park Ski Resort as a \"liftie\". WP has a world-reknowned disabled skier center, and a first rate ski school. His lift is the primary one for skiers from both programs. He finds it very rewarding and was recently recognized by his bosses for exceptional customer service. He plans on enrolling in another community college to take the First Responders Course so that he can move into ski patrol. He turned 21 in early December and is having a great time! DS #2 attends Dunwood Technical College in Minneapolis. He's in the HVAC program and really loving it. He's applied to Phi Beta Kappa honor society, and has been asked if he'd consider tutoring at some point. We found an efficiency apartment for him within walking distance of the college, in a funky area, right next to the Walker Art Center. So, he's got his own space and has really blossomed. (OMG, could they be...growing up???!!!) He continues to work weekends at the pet food supply store, which gives him just enough spending money for the occasional pizza (ok...probably more than just occasional) and gas. DH and I have been busy the last couple of months preparing our 1926 restored bungalow to put on the market. You might remember me saying we'd had a plan to relocate to Denver (which was put on hold due to someone's medical situation, ah hem) a while back, well, that has now become a reality. DH was promoted in November to a new position in a different group, where all of his employees are in CO; Dublin, Ohio; and Bolston, VA. We have a full calendar year to get moved, so, are jumping on getting our house in MN on the market, hopefully, seizing the opportunities (both selling & buying) that come with these low mortgage interest rates. Other notable items, we joined all you dog-loving sisters and on Labor Day brought home our mini long-haired wiener dog, Joey. He hails from Dubuque, Iowa and has been making us chuckle and providing wet and cold nose-pokes ever since. He's a dear little clown, and like Carol, we're thinking he needs a brother. DS #2 swears Joey is his replacement! LOL D1 - Yes, friend, the Vikes ROCK! Much to the chagrin of my cheese-head DH. Sorry to have been reading about your depression with Tamox. I recently stopped taking it, but, haven't told onco about that. The thinning hair, sleepless nights had me fed up with it. Come to read here, and think perhaps that little red spot on my left calf is the one that Norma describes as the superficial blood clot. I'll be seeing onco soon so, will be expecting some answers! Tell me about the 10 pills you take each day...you said 1 was a multi-vit, 1 was the tamox, what others for the se's? LOL about the lefse! DH and I made a huge batch this year. Sent half of it to DS #1 in CO, along with some pickled herring, he was in heaven! (yes, it's a weird Scandinavian thing...) KathyL - Thinking of you, dear. And, thanking you for the thoughtful SP gifts, you're the best! Julie - Oh, it's nip time!! YAY!! Having them has made such a difference for me! I will be getting the tats very soon. Are you using anything on the scars? I've noticed a slight improvement using New Skin Scar Therapy. Anyone have better luck with something else? Joan - So sorry to hear about your Mom. Thoughts to you and your family. CHJ - What a cute pic! Your hair is looking so nice! Will you keep it short? I've decided to do just that. I'm loving the 20 minutes or so I've gained back each morning, by having the short, sassy hairdo. I've gotten it trimmed several times, and also color it (to hide a few grays and help the mousy brown). What's the general thought, sisters, everyone keeping theirs short?? Carla - Didn't we tell you, no falling down!! Geez. Hope the bumps and bruises are healing. What a cool note from your customer. Carol - The pictures of the doggies crack me up! Wow! And, I thought we had a lot of snow! Paula - Have fun on your break! LOL on the Burger King body spray...I'd be afraid the dog and DH would try to lick and nibble on me if I used that! Kimberly - YAY for Kathleen. Glad to hear you're feeling a little more \"seasonal\". Norma - Was amazed to read your post about that little red spot. I had dismissed mine as typical dry skin issues (everything in MN during the winter is dry, ugh!). It happened to coincide with my decision to stop the tamox, thank goodness! I will be interested to hear what your onco says next week. I have just started taking a low dose aspirin now, after reading about the blood clot issues. Well, sisters, sorry this got so long. DH, Joey and I are on vacation in the Rocky Mountains this week. The weather has been incredible, and we're looking forward to seeing both DS's later today. Will check in later. Tina",

Kimberly \u2013 DH doesn\u2019t ski, either.  However, I am a fair weather skier.  I\u2019m the one on the slopes first thing in the morning, before the mountain is all torn up by the shredders.  I\u2019m usually \u201cdone\u201d by early afternoon, and looking for a sauna and hot tub.  I suppose I\u2019ll need to cut those last two activities out so as not to aggravate the LE. A note about the students\u2026don\u2019t discount the life lessons you impart on them\u2026I think you\u2019d be surprised how many, later in their lives, will recall those memories.  The reason I say that, is that I do it all the time!

Carol -- Good thought-provoking topic, about the onco checking out the whole bod.  I, like you, have only had the run-of-the-mill neck, ankles, listening to lungs and heart.  Although, I have been seeing my ps during my good weeks for expander fills, he sees me on top, and has only remarked how good things are looking.  So...I take that as a good sign.  But, I think I would feel better if onco took a look, too.  I'm going to mention it next time -- she's really fab, I can talk to her about anything.  Thanks for the idea. Have a great 'cation.  Vettegal -- so glad to hear about your mom.  Prayers and good wishes continue to head out to your sis.   Paula -- Hoping your se's are few, I can just see you with the cats...I can hardly type this, got a head laying on my forearm... Kimberly -- You're sounding good.  I forgot that you get all three chemo's at once.  I'm sure you've got the mixed bag of se's.   Just think...you don't have to pay all that $$ for plumped lips, all the Hollywood types are going to be so jealous!

Tomorrow I head in for another \u201clast\u201d, my final expander fill.  Then, on Thursday I\u2019ll be having my port removed.  I am really looking forward to that thing being out.  I wonder if the ps will be able to do something about the scar, right below the port itself.  It\u2019s larger than I anticipated (probably due to the whole area being stretched and expanded), and not pretty. Therese \u2013 It sounds like you had a great time on your walk!  What a wonderful experience.  Such a great accomplishment, and it\u2019s so cool that you honored the Jewels. Julie - When is your appointment to discuss reconst? Maz \u2013 Thinking of you for tomorrow!  FUBC!!  Hope it\u2019s uneventful and over in a quick hurry. Carol \u2013 Best wishes going out to you as you head in tomorrow, too! Wendy \u2013 Go get \u2018em tomorrow.  Half-way point, right?  FUBC! TTFN, Tina",

      "Content": "Jan 4, 2009 01:17PM - edited Jan 5, 2009 02:05PM by tinalee123 Good Sunday afternoon, Jewels.  Boy!  Where did the holidays go??  Like our teacher-sisters, I was off work the last two weeks.  Going back tomorrow will be a rude awakening.  But, it\u2019s been wonderful being home and on vacation.  We\u2019re already planning another trip to Colorado.  DH finds it easier to fly there each week and do his thing.  I\u2019d like to go with him for the MLK holiday and go skiing at DS\u2019s Winter Park Resort.   I have to tell you all about my ski purchase.  I haven\u2019t had new skis in about 15 years.  Technology has come a LONG way.  I\u2019ve been doing a lot of research and decided I really didn\u2019t want to lay down a lot of $$ for them.  I found that K2 made a ski in 2006 called \u201cJust Cause\u201d.  If you\u2019re not familiar with K2\u2019s women\u2019s line, it\u2019s really amazing.  They have an entire department that researches and designs ski gear by, and for, women.  Anyway, the \u201cJust Cause\u201d package was created in support of breast cancer awareness, with 1% of the sales being donated (in addition to K2\u2019s annual donation of $100K) to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.  Check out this old link at Amazon: www.amazon.com/K2-Cause-Marker...  Of course, being two seasons old, I couldn\u2019t find these ANYWHERE.  Just had to have them, though!  My ultra-internet-sleuthing DH found a brand new pair on Craigslist.  Some guy in Montana bought them for his survivor Mom, but, she decided she had \u201coutgrown\u201d downhill skiing.  YAY for me!  Not only did they have the cute pink ribbons on the skis, they came with color-matched Marker bindings and similarly designed poles, get this \u2013 a little pink crystal \u201cdiamond\u201d imbedded in the grips of the poles!!  Talk about a January Jewel!  I\u2019m very excited about this find! Julie \u2013 Isn\u2019t the whole ps thing amazing??  It\u2019s good that you\u2019ve got someone who is very particular\u2026I do, too.  He\u2019s got a very dry way about him, and he\u2019s very serious, but, brilliant.  We have gotten him to laugh every now and then!  Your description of the construction of the nips sounds just like mine.  Your areola piece is quite interesting.  I\u2019ll just be having a tattoo, which I\u2019ll get on Wednesday.  I haven\u2019t tried the Mederma yet, think I\u2019ll give it a whirl.  It\u2019s a bit more expensive than the stuff I am using now.   KathyL \u2013 YAY on the MRI and the port removal!  Let\u2019s see\u2026we can think up something new to explain the craziness\u2026let me work on that.  Got the new Bon Appetit!  Am loving it, thank you again!  DH and I made shrimp gumbo yesty, was a recipe from Emeril, took it to our neighbor\u2019s house last night and enjoyed it with her.  I\u2019ll really miss our wining/dining buddy when we move, we\u2019ve been trying to coax her into relocating with us! Carol \u2013 Isn\u2019t technology something?  Like that zillow.com site.  We\u2019ve used that while researching houses in Colorado.  It\u2019s a little creepy, too.  That picture was taken a while back, three \u201ccars ago\u201d for our youngest son, which is parked right in front of the place! LOL  We do have a nice neighborhood.  We live 1 block from an elementary school, and are 5 minutes from MSP airport, but, are in a small triangle that doesn\u2019t get any plane traffic overhead.  We\u2019re 3 blocks from the Mississippi River, 3 blocks from Minnehaha Creek/Falls/Park, 3 blocks from the light rail.  There\u2019s a parkway along the creek where all of the marathons/runs take place, and is also a wonderful walking/biking path.  The past couple of years, it appears people are wanting to move back into the city, so, they\u2019re \u201ctaking back\u201d neighborhoods that had gone into disrepair.  We\u2019ll be having a realtor preview on Tuesday, and an open house next Sunday.  We hope there will be some interested people coming through.  Here\u2019s a link to a tour of our house that the realtors put together: http://spacecrafting.com/ssp.aspx?id=1430d9d1-0d60-40e8-b9ba-43b702f4183 There\u2019s a very exclusive neighborhood east of us, on the other side of St. Paul, called \u201cNorth Oaks\u201d.  It\u2019s a gated community, I believe houses start at the $1 mil mark there.  They\u2019ve got a lawsuit against Google maps (and probably zillow, too) to try and block them from coming in and filming their streets and homes.  It appears they\u2019ve got the law on their side, as their streets are all private roads, not city streets.  Don\u2019t know what to think about that\u2026I guess that\u2019s their right. Kimberly \u2013 How\u2019d you like \u201cForever Plaid\u201d??  We saw that here a while ago, it had quite a long run and faithful following.  I thought it was really great.  Santa was very good to me this year, I was surprised with two tickets to see my all-time favorite band, The Pretenders!  They will be here in Minneapolis at First Avenue (Prince\u2019s former place) at the end of February!  I\u2019m so damn excited, I can hardly stand it!!  Chrissie Hynde is\u2026well, who I wanted to be when I grew up!!  LOL   On top of that, we\u2019ll be traveling to Ohio \u2013 Nelsonville to be exact, to see one of our favorite bands, Cowboy Junkies.  They are touring this year, but, Ohio is the closest to MN that they\u2019ll be.  So, we\u2019ve got tickets to see them at the Stuart\u2019s Opera House in early February.  2009 is the year that I do more of this kind of thing\u2026  ☺ Paula \u2013 LOL at Guitar Hero!!  Did you ever see the South Park episode with Stan and Kyle playing GH?  OMG  LMAO!!  Google it\u2026it\u2019s a crack up.  That shit is hard\u2026I tried tennis-doubles with some friends\u2019 children during Thanksgiving.  Holy cow!  Am I bad!  They kicked my butt all over the place!  I am thinking, now that DH and I are empty-nesters, we need to get a Wii \u2013 won\u2019t the boys be pissed!  Ha ha ha Like so many of you, we have un-holidized now.  All the Christmas dec\u2019s are gone\u2026it\u2019s a little sad.  Geez, I never even got out my holiday houses.  I have a large collection of those Dept. 56 light-up houses, mine are the \u201cNorth Pole\u201d series.  Very cute and pretty all lit up at night, but, just a whole lot of work!  Next year. Off to heat up some gumbo and get ready for the games this afternoon.  Jeepers, I started typing this and it was still \"morning\", had to go back and switch the salutation to \"afternoon\"!  Sorry about that!  Tina",

Carol \u2013 Okay, am worried about you and the weather out there.  I know you said you hadn\u2019t got anything, but, jeepers it looks ominous!  Hope it doesn\u2019t move further south. (I believe that\u2019s where you are, in relation to Seattle.) Maz \u2013 Thinking of you, and sending best wishes for good news! Tat update - No big deal.  Waited for the ps longer than it took him to \"draw\" them on.  He did a good job, they're not perfect and the coloring seems good, although it's still pretty raw.  I really didn't feel much, but, he gave novocaine.  Am really pleased, they feel and look complete. GTG \u2013 TGIF!! Tina",

Wvgirl -- I'm reminded of a bumper sticker I've seen around my area...\"Mean People Suck\".  They really do, don't they?  IMO, behavior like that comes back around.  jkiss -- dealing with and facing the \"big picture\" is always more overwhelming and seemingly insurmountable, especially when certain things are beyond your control.  Try taking smaller \"pieces\" and dealing with them individually.  With the little one, you obviously have a priority there.  But, allow yourself to mourn -- your body, your beloved pet, etc.  It's exhausting, but, can be therapeutic.  It also gives you the ability to move beyond and onto other things.  You're among friends, here.  Good wishes heading your way! Wishing everyone a Sunday that's restful and relaxing.  Hoping the se's are at a minimum!   Will check in later. Tina ",

LJ and Sunshine \u2013 Thoughts are with you today.  Kimberly \u2013 Good to know the sushi experience was uneventful.  Carol \u2013 I can only IMAGINE the sushi you must be able to get.  We have found a wholesale distributor here that supplies the restaurants.  He\u2019s a crack up, his name is Red and he\u2019s from Boston.  Everything he says in his Bostonian accent makes me chuckle, \u201clobsta\u201d, \u201cgroupa\u201d.  But, he\u2019s got some fine sushi-grade seafood.  Who\u2019d of thunk it \u2013 in the middle of Minnesota!!  Sorry to hear your tummy isn\u2019t quite right, hope that improves soon.  Kimberly and Carol \u2013 Wine\u2026(whine???), no, no, the FUN kind.  I recently found a wonderful German Riesling, Clean Slate 2006.  I think it would be great with sushi, not too dry, not too sweet.  I also love Naked, Snoqualmie Riesling Columbia Valley (WA) \u2013 it\u2019s organic \u2013 have been trying to do much more in terms of organic foods and drinks.  I also enjoy Rieslings from Willamette Valley (OR).  All of those are great with all foods.  But, my favs are the Pinot Noirs.  You can\u2019t beat a good Sonoma County Pinot (Mark West), Australia has some good ones, too.  I also like Five Rivers Pinot from the Central Coast.  Any suggestions on organic Pinots?? Dana \u2013 Your \u201cDana time\u201d ROCKS!!  I am inspired by your take charge, can do attitude.  I am totally a believer in karma, too.  What goes around, comes around, baby.  \u201cDo unto others\u2026\u201d  Right??  It\u2019s all the same\u2026whether you view it from a religious perspective or a universe perspective.  It\u2019s about treating people and things (animals, environment, etc.) the way you wish to be treated.  Respect.  This is the one thing I hammered (okay\u2026continue to hammer) on both of my ds\u2019s (20 and 18).  Ever since they were little.  One totally gets it.  The other is getting better.  I believe it just leads to a happier life. Vettegal \u2013 Oh, I am praying that your sister\u2019s dx is not the evil wench (aka bc).  Good and positive thoughts are aimed at her, you and your mom. CHJ \u2013 Glad to hear your sunny outlook on things.  You deserve it, as do we all!! My story:  Found lump during BSE this past autumn, mammo last year showed nothing \u2013 those things are crap.  Went right in for biopsy and got the bad news.  Margins too poor.  I said, \u201ctake em both\u201d, as I really don\u2019t need \u2018em any more \u2013 ha ha.  I just didn\u2019t want to deal with any potential future bc.  Surgery Dec. 10th  with reconst expanders, chemo started Jan. 10th.  I have no family history.  To say I was pissed off, is putting it mildly.  I have things to do, places to go and see (aka LIFE) with my beloved dh.  I fell in love with him 24 years ago.  I was single, he was not.  We went our separate ways, but, always stayed friendly due to working at the same company (Qwest).  I later married a wretched man, but, was blessed with two beautiful sons who give me (for the most part) a run for my money, and much happiness.  Divorced the dope 6 years ago.  Reconnected with my true love out of the blue a couple of years later, convinced him to marry me in 2006.  We celebrate two years of wedded bliss April 13th.  I am surely convinced that God played a role in this\u2026I was blessed with this man at the most crucial point in my life.  He\u2019s been a godsend, the most wonderful caregiver.  I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done to deserve him, but, I am thanking God (and my lucky stars) that he\u2019s here and he loves me.  My concern about bc is, my onco told me during our first meeting in January that I was the 4th woman in my age group (45) that she\u2019d seen THAT WEEK who\u2019d been dx with bc, with no family hx.  She said there\u2019s \u2018something out there\u2019, and they don\u2019t know what it is.  So, I\u2019ve been examining what I do, what I eat (hence the fixation with organics), how I behave\u2026if I\u2019d known I was going to get bc, I would\u2019ve been a REALLY bad girl\u2026just kidding.  But, seriously!  I eat right, exercise is a little lacking (at least I\u2019m honest), I drink very moderately, I\u2019ve never smoked, never done drugs (ok, ok,  weed in college \u2013 sorry girls, I ain\u2019t perfect).  I don\u2019t get it.  Is it the Splenda I put in my coffee\u2026is it the bologna sandwiches my mom made us eat as kids\u2026is it the air I breathe, what the hell is it?????  Totally with you all on encouraging friends, family and others on BSE\u2019s \u2013 they are so necessary.  Sorry this post got so long.  Hugs to all\u2026 Tina",

I, too, lost my hair right after tx #2 (days 15-16).  So, I've joined the baldy bunch!  I have a nice wig that I wear when I go out.  But, for quick trips/errands it's all about the polar fleece (thank goodness for that stuff!).  Around the house I'm usually in a bandana.   Carol -- I would LOVE to order a t-shirt.  Please reserve one for me -- medium.  I will send you a pm. To everyone else -- I am in awe of your positive attitudes, your supportive natures, your guidance and your determined outlooks!   I am honored and thankful this support mechanism is here and to have found you all! Best wishes go out to those getting tx today.  Positive vibes go out to those dealing with se's.   Will check in later... Tina ",

The chili feed fund raiser that my co-workers held in my honor yesterday, went exceptionally well.  It was a pot-luck, with 11 crock pots brought in, and all eaten with an hour and a half!  I just work with the best folks!  I was bummed to miss the festivities, as I hadn't seen any of these people since I was diagnosed at the end of November.  So, I sent many of the ones I am close to the two pics I shared with you all here and told them the story of this great group of women I met on the internet.  I got a few wise cracks from some of my single, male colleagues asking me if I could pass along a few tips... I will be busy with Easter duties this weekend, but, will be lurking when I can.  I hope those who've had tx this week, will have se's mild enough to have a wonderful weekend.  And, those who are experiencing a good stretch of days, rock on! Thinking of you all and sending hugs! Tina ",

Carol -- March was my first chemopause month.  I've been experiencing hot flashes, mostly in the form of night sweats since December.  Not extreme, but, certainly bothersome.   Haven't had the baseline blood test for estrogen levels, yet.  I will ask at the next (last) chemo.   Paula -- Bet it's nice to have some quiet.  Both ds #1 and #2 are gone for the weekend.  By about Sunday evening, I'm looking forward to having them back. Sunshine -- Congrats on being done! Well, I've got the typical taxol/neulasta aches going on today.  But, I'm fighting my way through them because dh and I went up and got our trailer with the Harley's out of storage.  You KNOW it's spring, now!  We've got the fever, that's for sure.  We may even get a quick ride around the parkway in today.  We also have a little Mazda Miata that we keep stored in the same place, we won't go fetch her until May.    Hope all the Jewels are enjoying their Saturday.  Will check in later.

Kimberly \u2013 If I\u2019m ever in Lincoln, CA, I\u2019m stopping by for a glass of wine!  (When the \u2018open\u2019 sign is hanging.) What an inviting area it sounds like it\u2019s turning out to be.  Our back deck is like that.  I\u2019m looking forward to a little warmer weather when we can enjoy the dh\u2019s smoked ribs with the neighbors. Carol \u2013 So very cool to hear about ds\u2019 qualifying for nationals.  He must be so excited.  Did you get  everything planted?  No ride on the Harleys\u2026dh is still doing some work on mine, adding heated grips and some bling here and there.  I\u2019ll have to take a picture when he\u2019s done.  Therese \u2013 How are you feeling?  Did you pass on work this last weekend? KathyL - I totally get your \"busy = normal\" feeling.  I really strived to stay busy during the months I worked from home.  The memorial for your friends' Mom sounded beautiful.  Thanks for keeping track of everyone week after week.   Paula \u2013 You gotta be getting close to making your goal for the trip, don\u2019t you?  Boy, I think you\u2019ve thought of every possible way to raise money!  Busy, busy, busy!  That\u2019s just got to feel so good, the closer you get. Peg \u2013 What a blessing to hear from your son.  I\u2019m sure that gives you a sense of relief and possibly a little encouragement?  I hope he comes home soon. Cathy-CA \u2013 I\u2019m with you on the taste buds.  I\u2019m just over three weeks out from the last chemo, and like you said, every now and then I find something that hits the right spot.  It\u2019s just gotta be a matter of time, eh?  Sooner or later those little buggers will be back. Joan \u2013 Glad you had a nice birthday!  It\u2019s so fun celebrating with family members.  Sherry \u2013 That\u2019s right\u2026every 5 years or so, my birthday lands on Mother\u2019s Day.  I don\u2019t mind\u2026I like to spend it with my Mom and my sil (who\u2019s b-day is the 11th, too).  I have to say I get treated pretty darn good.  How sweet of your dd and fiancé to make that donation in your honor.  Perfect gift! D1 \u2013 I followed your recommendation \u2013 no vacuuming or cleaning the stove!!  YAY!! No rads, friend!  Carla - I'm glad you had such a nice weekend with the dd's. Good for you on the relay's!   Julie - What a cool thing ds did for you!  Don't stress, friend.  It'll work itself out.  Sending positive energy and good wishes to you for Wednesday!    Kris \u2013 Sending good wishes your way for a mild tx tomorrow! I received a very sweet birthday card in the mail from my SP.  Included was a fantastic recipe for Citrus Chicken and Rice.  I can\u2019t wait to give that a whirl!  I\u2019m not certain of my SP\u2019s identity\u2026at first I thought I\u2019d figured it out\u2026but, now, I\u2019m not so sure.  This is very fun, thank you Kimberly and Carol for coming up with the idea. Have a great evening everyone. Tina",

Watched the most exciting two minutes in sports today, the Kentucky Derby.  Very exciting, and very sad, with the second place filly having to be euthanized right on the track after breaking both of her front ankles.  The winner of the derby (Big Brown) was born and raised here in MN.  Deb \u2013 Glad to hear that your area didn\u2019t get hit with the severe weather.  Boy, it sure was all around you, though.  I love Moonlight, too.  One of the few that dh will watch with me.  Kimberly \u2013 To have the port put in and removed, I had a doc from the heart and vascular center (same day surgery) at my hospital.  The area is still a little tender to the touch, and has some of that dermabond over it.  I\u2019m hoping the scar will stay nice and thin.  After the port was put in and the scar healed, it appeared to widen, no doubt due to that skin being stretch during the port fills.  It\u2019s always sumthin\u2019!  Thanks for remembering my friend/co-worker.  I\u2019ll pass along that \u201chey\u201d and the good wishes. Julie \u2013 That would be great if you could get in for your reconstruction so soon.  Sounds like you\u2019ll be one busy gal, though!  Congratulations on your celebratory dinner!  Oooo, dang, crab legs sound good!  I, like KathyL and Therese had reconstruction done at the time of bi-lat mast surgery.  I would go in for my fills (about 100cc a time) on one of my good days, between chemo.  It worked really well.  I had no pain at the time of the fills, but took 400mg Motrin just in case.  The expanders are hard, with some bulging at the sides.  I\u2019m looking forward to the exchange.  The ps said the recovery time is much shorter than the mast, and with no drains.  Carol \u2013 I was thinking about your ds and his tattoo.  Both of my boys have pierced ears, no tats yet (they can\u2019t afford \u2018em).  I think it\u2019s sweet that he\u2019d want to honor you with something like that.  A good tattoo shop will listen to his reasons for wanting the tat, and, may have some creative alternatives to the pink ribbon. Thank you for your kind words related to my friend.  I\u2019m so relieved that she\u2019s in good hands, she\u2019s going to the same cancer center and seeing my onc.  Diana \u2013 Good news on four taxol\u2019s left!!  You\u2019re on the downhill slide, girl! Will check in later gems, I better go find dh\u2026he\u2019s been in the garage most of the day. Tina",

Just a quick hello.  Been a busy week at work for me, going into the office everyday to take a technical course.    Julie, been thinking of you all day and hope things went according to plan.  Check in when you can! Lovely day here today.  Had some rain and sunshine, then all of a sudden the trees are leafing out!  Where the heck did those come from??  Heard on the radio there were snow showers in far northern MN.  Just a reminder that our possible snow season continues until the end of May.   Hope you're all well.   Tina ",

Heading off to the ps this morning, for a post-op check of the new foobies.  Wednesday didn't feel all that great, and actually ran a temp later in the day.  Yesty was much better, temp was gone, took a shower and peeled back the dressings.  Ps used the same incision as mast, so just have a bunch of steri-strips along part of that line.  I'll be interested to hear from ps today how the nips will be created.  Wanted to let you all know too, that my friend from work that got bc (we're telling people at work not to drink the water), started chemo on Wednesday.  She's going to my same cancer center and onco!  So, I'm glad she's going to be in such good hands.  I'm also able to give her a few tips about how things work there.    Carol -- Sounds like you've got a busy weekend with training and fish displacement.  Hope your weather is nice and you time outside is pleasant.  Thank you for sending the update on Jenn. Julie -- Glad to hear you are feeling so good.  YAY that the drains are out!  That will help the sleeping situation.  I have to chuckle over your comment about everyone else who is so busy, and that you wouldn't have the energy!  Between you, Kathy and Therese with your little ones (and all the others with teen children in sports)...it's YOU who have the true energy.  I can't even IMAGINE having to go through this when my guys were little.  You all amaze me, I'm pretty certain I never had that much energy. Kimberly -- Your trip will be so fabulous!  The one thing to remember about AZ weather...it never lasts.  Although, lightening storms in the desert are among some of the most beautiful things.  I can't wait to hear about your stop in Sedona.  Open yourself up to it.  Visualize the energy there.  Have a great time, sis! Dana -- I still have my ovaries.  So, I am in the camp of uncertainty when it comes to tamox.  My ER/PR are \"weakly positive\"...putting yet another spin on things.  Our Memorial Day plans always include smoking of ribs (thanks to dh), and a visit to the cemetary.  We pick up where my Granny left off, \"grooming\" all the headstones of those who have gone before us and adding nice fresh flowers.  Hope to get in some walking and a visit to the farmers' market...looking for some purple basil. Gotta run and get ready for the ps appointment, will shout-out more later. Have a great day all! Tina ",

Patty \u2013 What a great bit about vetteguy!!  Is he the best, or what?  You gotta love a man like that!    By the way, I\u2019ve been told that flax seed is quite helpful in reducing the severity of the hot flashes.  Haven\u2019t tried it myself, but, am tempted to.  A lady at my office dumps some in her \u201cvita-mix\u201d blender every morning with her fruit smoothy.  Anyone else have one of those??  She got hers at Costco, they\u2019re pretty spendy from what she says, but, they use theirs every single day.  I\u2019m seriously considering it.  And, yes, it\u2019s my understanding that once the ov\u2019s are gone, it\u2019s just as if you\u2019re in menopause, so, you\u2019ll need something other than tamox for maintenance.  CHJ \u2013 I was \u201cpinked\u201d out, too.  In fact, I switched to purple to spite everyone and everything.  Eventually, I returned to pink...I liked the color long before the dx.  Paula \u2013 I hope DH\u2019s situation does nothing but imporove.  You\u2019ve done an incredible job balancing everything.  You\u2019re right\u2026one day at a time.  Glad to hear you\u2019ve joined the Mac world\u2026I think you\u2019ll find it easy and reliable.  We\u2019ve always had Mac\u2019s, if you ever need any technical support, please let me know. Well, gotta run and get some laundry in the wash\u2026otherwise, DH will be doing vetteguy\u2019s dance at work\u2026that would NOT be good\u2026 Tina",

Kathy, so cool you didn't need the BGP today.  Glad it went well for you.  Deb, it'll feel so good to get the \"deportation\" scheduled!  The reconstruction is such a personal decision.  It's good that you're going to talk to someone about it.  You'd be surprised what a difference it could make.   Patty, bummer about the LE!  I've started wearing my sleeve all day, every day now.  And, am very religious about \"clearing\" and the massage.  DH helps me with the shoulder and back, gently guiding the fluid down.  I've noticed a real change.  I think I may get an exercise video from JoAnn Rovig at the Northwest Lymphedema Center.  I'm a little worried about air travel.  I'm heading to Denver next weekend.  We'll see how it goes.  I may try to get a new sleeve/gauntlet for the trip.

(a great vacation destination btw), then back to the coast, up the 101 all the way to WA, around the peninsula, hung out in Bremerton, took the ferry over to Whidbey Island and then up to Anacortes and Bellingham!  Whew!  It was fabulous, soul-searching and reflective.  What a cool place!  Thanks for being the trigger for those dynamite memories! To my Taxol sis\u2019 (Deb and Paula, and anyone else who\u2019s with us) \u2013 Boy, did I get my a** kicked yesterday!  I can\u2019t decide if the he!! I went through was due to going overboard with errands on Sat., or trying to evade the nausea thing by not taking any of the drugs\u2026I just don\u2019t know!  But, I felt like I had an alien in my gut.  I liken it to severe menstrual pains, more hip/belly area pain than nausea\u2026so, it didn\u2019t occur to me until last night to get back on my regiment that I had when I was on AC.  Thankfully, I slept well last night and am better today, but, have been taking my rx timely.  I didn\u2019t take the rx\u2019s initially, due my onco advising me I \u201cmay not need them\u201d.  I say, take \u2018em if ya\u2019 gottem\u2019.  I hope this is an isolated incident and the two of you won\u2019t experience it.  Just have your meds handy!  I\u2019ve been taking Tylenol every 4 hours, then, Motrin every four hours.  Seems to help with those body aches.  Taste buds are still dead to the world\u2026 LJ13 \u2013 any ideas??  Kimberly \u2013 Thanks for the note about pt.  I\u2019ll continue with the home exercises, too.  I laughed about your comments about staying warm.  I, too, have had the furnace going like crazy and have been taking hot baths\u2026ds #2 walks around in shorts, go figure.

D1 \u2013 Sorry to hear about your nails!  It\u2019s cool that you and cg can do things like that \u2013 I always wanted a daughter!  I hope your nails begin improving soon and that the tonies (what we used to call \u2018em when we were little) escape unscathed.  Julie \u2013 Girl, I\u2019m knocking on wood for you right now!!  Here\u2019s hoping you\u2019ve got this nausea/vomiting thing under control!! Kathy \u2013 Love the last two sentences of that story.  It\u2019s a great reminder \u2013 and helps us all be a little more compassionate when we realize that everyone is going through some level of strife or struggle.  This is good for me\u2026I have a particularly nasty neighbor.  Thanks for that. I'll check up on everyone later.   Tina ",

You\u2019re heading in the right direction, girl! Jenn \u2013 I\u2019ll be interested to hear what you have to say about pt\u2026I\u2019m staying tuned!

We FINALLY got a Trader Joe\u2019s last year\u2026haven\u2019t ventured in there yet.  Have heard about two buck chuck and all the other goodies from my angel neighbor.  Gotta get over there for sure now!  Congrats on the great grades \u2013 you have A LOT on your plate, be proud!  Also \u2013 I know it seems old fashioned, but, \u201cTucks\u201d for the bottom helped me a great deal.  The relief is fairly temporary, but, I use them after every bm, following tp.  They do feel great, while it lasts. Kimberly \u2013 It would be a gas for the Jewels to all meet and be on the Oprah show \u2013 I would so go for that!  Wendy \u2013 YAY!!  What fabulous news!  I\u2019ll report on my taxol experiences as I go, I\u2019ll be one ahead of you, I think (#2 Thursday the 20th). Carol \u2013 Lucky you \u2013 home brew!  I have ventured, oh so carefully, back into alcohol consumption.  I have one or two, and only on the week in between tx\u2019s.  Onco said not to drink it when on meds following tx, so that leaves me with about a 7 or 8 day window.  Another thing killing me is no sushi!  Dang that\u2019s a tough one.  And to top it off, my onco is married to a Japanese cardio doc, she and her dh eat sushi frequently and travel to Japan, too.  She said when chemo is over, she and her dh will take us out for sushi celebration.  I am way looking forward to that. Sheshe \u2013 Have missed you, totally understand the absence.  Glad to hear about your aunt\u2019s husband \u2013 good news is always welcome here!  Take care. Hugs to all! Tina ",

Carol \u2013 That quilt is absolutely beautiful.  What a gift!!  I bet you feel comforted and loved wrapped up in that.  I\u2019m so happy for you to have something like that, so beautiful and touching. Sounds like you had a weekend full of celebration and happy times!  YAY!  Dontcha love that?  Your step dd\u2019s sound like a blessing.  Yes, dh and I both have Harley\u2019s.  We just got our licenses last year, they\u2019ve been a lot of fun.  Previously I had a pink scooter.  Gotta love the mpg on those \u2013 90+.  Trouble is, you can only ride these around about 6 months (or less)  of the year.  We\u2019ve had the Miata for quite a while.  It\u2019s fun, too.  It\u2019s cool your dad is having fun with his.  There are all sorts of Miata clubs all over the US.  The one that\u2019s here close to us is a little, um, uppity.  So, we do our own thing.  It sure was a good feeling to write the words, \u2018last tx\u2019.  I can\u2019t believe it.  Still have the port to get removed, one more expansion, and the implant exchange.  But\u2026one milestone at a time!! KathyL \u2013 Oh, friend, you can taste chocolate?!?!?  Lucky girl!!  My taste buds have completely gone AWOL.  So, strange, I was starting to get them \u201cback\u201d a bit at the end of AC, but, after taxol #2 three weeks ago, nuthin\u2019!  Your dinner sounds fabulous.  Your dh is a treasure!  That Wild Horse Pass Resort looks fab. Jenn \u2013 Dear, you have had your \u201cshare\u201d too!  Honestly, I am shocked at how many of our gems are dealing with the added stresses of family members and friends going through medical crises.  You know you can speak your mind and empty your heartfelt feelings here\u2026no judgments, just support, support, support.  Sending good thoughts and wishes to you, your family and fil. Patty \u2013 I was thinking of you last night.  Dh and I had some dish channel on watching the Mercum auto auction.  They had quite the line up of vette\u2019s.  You would have liked it.  These were restored, older beauty\u2019s from the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s.  Boy, they were fetching 6-figures!  My dh is all about the \u201968 camaro\u2019s, but, last night it was all about the vette\u2019s. Paula \u2013 You, too, could write a book!  Actually, I tell ds #1 and #2 \u2013 When are you going to write YOUR book??  You seem to know everything about everything\u2026I\u2019m waiting for your book to come out!!  Ds #1 is and always has been more challenging than ds #2.  Now that he\u2019s 20 ½, he REALLY thinks he knows it all.  He\u2019s got everything figured out, except laundry, a house over his head, food, college, spending money, car and insurance.  Hmmm\u2026I left home when I was 18, and never went back \u2013 ever.  Hope everyone is resting this Sunday evening, and that SE's are minimal.  Will be surfing for a while and will check back later.

Tina p.s.  of course, who said we'd be leaving the spa???  p.p.s.  this is the resort my family and I stayed at a few years ago, not as \"spa\" like, although near the airport and the baseball stadium (close to ASU in Tempe):  www.marriott.com/hotels/travel... ",

Kimberly -- Our American Indian population in MN, WI and the Dakotas is very strong.  We have a mix here of Anishinabe (Ojibway), Sioux and Dakota.  They were the first to greet the French traders and voyageurs (via the St. Lawrence seaway) and had thriving trades of goods, especially beaver, which was at the height of fashion in Europe.  As with so many American Indian populations, they were reduced to giving up their lands, and traditional ways of life, and forced onto reservations, as white people continued to move west.  Some of these lands were acceptable, most were not (think Badlands in So. Dakota -- there's a reason for the name).  In this day and age, many of our tribes are seeing new opportunities for commerce and financial gain via casinos.  But, generally, overall I'd have to say many of the smaller tribes continue to struggle.  Alcoholism, unemployment and segregation all contribute to these peoples' hardships.  My dh has some Cherokee in him, so, he too, is very interested in American Indian culture.  We vacation regularly to the north shore of Lake Superior at Grand Portage.  There's a strong, but, small Ojibway band there.  They have a casino which draws people from all over, MI, WI, MN and Canada.  Although, probably not as successful as some of the casinos on reservation land, closer to the metropolitan areas.   This area, at Grand Portage is historic, peaceful, relaxing and breathtaking.  There's never the wrong time to go -- each season has it's own gifts.  If you're so inclined, google \"Grand Portage\", it's an interesting story. CathyCA -- Missed you, I'm sorry to hear you got some bad news.  It is much more personal now, isn't it?  Damn cancer, it's becoming way too common. Paula -- Congrats on ds' honor.  You must be so proud!  What a great kid he is!  And, the icing on the cake was the homerun!  WOW.  You are one busy person.  I hope you're taking care of yourself, eating right and staying strong.   Do you find, staying busy like this, helps you combat the se's -- as well as get the mind off the inevitable? Dana -- You go girl!  Keep up your good work at school.  You're getting there -- keep your focus on you! Carol -- Cool news about the massage.  Definitely something to take advantage of!  Sorry to hear about the ds.  I bet that couldn't have felt good.  Poor thing.  I surprised the dr said he could get out skating again so soon.   Therese -- Great news on the moving forward with the exchange surgery.  Mine will be on the 20th of May.  Just one more thing \"down\".  How many weeks are you out now from your last tx?  Noting your 1/4\" hair.   Julie -- That earthquake has been all over the news.  Glad to know you didn't have any injuries, or damage.  Geez...who'd have thunk it...in IL!    Lastly, have you girls read about the plastic that is used in Nalgene bottles?  They are those popular water bottles, previously used only by the outdoorsy-types (camping, hiking, etc.), they've made their way into mainstream, every-day use.  Heck, dh and I had a small fortune invested in these things.  I kept one at my office desk, filled with ice water -- ensuring I got my 32 ounces of water a day!  Well, it's come out now that this plastic gives off estrogen, and has been linked to breast and prostate cancer!  It's the same plastic that is used in some baby bottles.  My onc told me about this on Thursday -- she's pissed!  She has two little ones.  Saw an article in the newspaper today that reported Canada has banned this plastic, called BPA (bisphenol A), from being used in the manufacture of the baby bottles. You will know this plastic, from other water bottles, it is rigid, you cannot squeeze or flex it.  Often times, although not always, it will have the number \"2\" on the bottom of it.  Don't confuse it with the recycling code that is stamped within a triangle.  Please get them out of your house, car, backpack, camping gear immediately.   All for now jewels, will check in later. Hope all who had tx this week are hanging in there.   Tina ",
