I am a high school coach with a season approaching that Im not sure Im even going to be able to be there for.  I need to have everything planned out before I can acknowledge whether I have to give that up.  Im sure at that point, with chemo inevitable, that I will have to let them know.  But at my timing, my way. I live in a small town that would thrive on this type of gossip and Im too public a figure to not be a target for speculation.  I have been a person that has been in control of everything my whole life and now I have lost total control - I'm still struggling to make thru each day, let alone putting on the strong face for the rest of the world to see.",
