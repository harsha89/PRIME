Life is too short and none of us know how long we are going to be here. That is up to God. Any one of us can walk out of the house tomorrow and be hit by a truck, fall and crack our head open....etc. We have to worry about this for the rest of our lives and I refuse to let it control me. My surgeon wasn't sure how many lymph nodes he took from me, path report only showed 2, and in his report he put that he did a complete disection! So, I could worry about daily, but not going to, it is what it is. I was given extra radiation boosters in the armpit due to it and hope that does the trick I am here today and will make the best of it, and the good Lord willing....I will do the same tomorrow. Lynette I hope you are feeling better real soon. God bless and HUGS Lori",

I am no longer going to CTCA, as I am done with treatment now and just being watched. So I found an Onc here to go to. I believe you get the same treatments for cancer at CTCA as anywhere else, its all the other things they do that make the difference and they take care of everything for you. There is no waiting for test results, usually you get them the next day, the food in the cafeteria is all natural and organic. You are just treated like a queen!",

He did not like how she was treated during her treatments, which is why he started CTCA. I know, \"bottom line\" it is all about the money, but the employees there are really genuine, kind and caring. I wish I was still going there. But now it is just a matter of tests and check ups to make sure the cancer doesn't return or mets.

Different chemicals, different metabolisms, different reactions. Some ladies have trouble with finger and toe nails, or eye brows and eye lashes falling out several times. I was fortunate and did not have any of those issues. Charmaine, I agree with MaryNY....I don't think the neauralgia is noticable either. I think we are just our own worst critics!

I will look into the keratine when I get back. Great pics, I think I remember seeing them on an earlier post. Chelev, I am so sorry you are having your eyelashes and eyebrows fall out again. Especially after getting your makeover and feeling sooooo good about yourself. I have read from other gals that have that happen. Are you on herceptin? Or maybe it is from whatever your chemo was. I did adrymiacin, cytoxin and taxol. Knock on wood, I have not had mine fall out. But those that did, say they come back quickly! At some point I will post another pic, I just don't know if I will have time before I leave. Hugs to all, Lori",

As for my hair, during the wedding......well it is very very humid and hot in Hawaii. That being said, no matter what I did to my hair, the heat and humidity took over. I used combs on the side to hold it back and bought a white flower to put on the side also. So it wasn't the best, but that's ok.....it's hair and I am alive! And on a side note, that heat and humidity is NOT good for hot flashes! Many hugs, Lori",

Give it another few weeks and you should start to see the brows and lashes coming in. Chemo stays in our bodies for some time after we are finished. And trust me, those leg and pubic hairs come back! You might also get facial fuzz, this is normal and it will go away after awhile. Some of the gals here have shaved theirs, I did not. Again in this matter.....PATIENTS! The hair growth also depends on what kind of other meds or treatments you will be on. Everyone is different. Hang in there, it will happen. Just not as quickly as we would like for it to. Lori",

As for hotflashes, I don't like to suggest anything because of all the contradicting information out there. I work with Naturopathic doctors, that work at the cancer center I go to, so the doctors know what is going on and what you are taking. I tried black cohosh with vit. E, didn't help me and they said it is ok to take it. I tried acupunture, that didn't work either. Now I take 2 tlbsp of flax meal 2x a day and I take clonidine (high blood pressure meds) twice a day. This all helps ALOT. I have hardly any flashes during the day at all, night time is a little different. Average about 1 flash every 2 hours. But that's better than 1 every half hour or more! Flax meal is another one of those contradicting things to take, but I trust my doctors and they say it is ok. You have to do what you feel is right. If you are comfortable with taking something, take it....if not, then don't! wblibrary, My hair is probably about 4\"-5\" long and no relaxing of the curls as of yet! AT ALL!  I am handling it the best I can. I have to keep telling myself \"its better than being bald\". I too hate my hair, but glad to have it. It takes quite awhile to get it to look like the picture, but that looks better than the curly. If I get lazy and do just curls, I'll take another pic. Thanks everyone for the comments! Hugs",

Although compliments are not what I am looking for, I just want to share the hair progress. Most of you are just a few months out, or just starting, and our hair just seems to be so important to us! Chelev & Jancie, my curls were noticable at 5 months (20 wks) PFC. I was able to start styling about 8 months (32 wks). I really thought that at this point, I would have had more hair than I do! I have kept a picture journal of my hair. Taking a picture every month. For those of you that have missed it, here it is. Only providing a link, because of the size, and it would take up too much space on the page. It is not updated, I have not added my pictures yet of the last 2 months, but from the last one on here and the one above, you can see there isn't too much difference. Jancie, looks like the hair fairy has made a mistake. (Putting the hair on your legs instead of on your head!) We need to have Bold send her another letter. She seems to have connections with her! Good girl CristleC, you are getting there! I do not know why our hair gets curly, must be something that chemo does. And from what I understand, not everyone gets the curls! Same with the eyelashes falling out, once mine came in, they stayed. I have not lost them again. Or the finger and toenails falling off. I know CristlC had that problem real bad. And then there is the foliculitis (sp). Just so much extra crap the we have to endure.....as if having the cancer isn't enough! I better stop......I see the makings of a RANT!  http://i267.photobucket.com/albums/ii319/goldie0827/Allofme4-1.jpg Lori",

I think because I was so excited to be getting hair, I did not want to take any of it away! Otter, I hope the leave in stuff gives you some satisfaction (and no lift). That is what I use, makes a big dif to me. I am almost ready to go out in public au natual, which I have not done yet to this day. ALWAYS wear my wig, thank goodness it's only once a week. Spring, it's washing out already? I don't remember if you said how much you paid for it, I hope it wasn't much.....and then there is the shipping charge on top of it. My color treatment only cost about $5, I have had it in about 6 weeks I think. It is starting to wash out now, but still has color to it, unless that is my own hair changing, which could be a possibility. I am not going to color it again, unless it turns more gray than anything else. Lori",

And I am one that does NOT like it! For the new girls, I have pictures on my profile of my hair growth, pretty much took one every month, so I could see the growth. In the beginning, I would have thought I would have more hair now than I do. Obviously, I am trying to grow it long again. For anyone else wanting to grow long, when you go for a trim (which you should do on occasion, it helps the hair grow) make sure they don't take much off from the area above the back of your neck. On me, they kept cutting that to keep it even with everything else. That hair on me is about 2-3 inches shorter than my longest areas. Here is my current hair status!  Hugs and happy hair growing!

But using the cool, I don't think will straighten it at all, never tried it! Maybe I should, eh? The high heat is pretty hot, sometimes I see.....what looks like smoke, but I think it is steam, from the damp hair. I hear you about arms and hands getting a workout, from trying to use dryer and round brush! You might be able to get the same results from any kind of dryer that has a brush attachement on it. This Conair, doesn't have a brush on it, just plastic teeth. And on each side, you can't see from the pic I posted, is like a velvet coating that your hair glides over, which after time, I'm sure will wear off. I have bought so many things to work with my hair. I have different size curling irons, curling brushes, flat iron, this Conair dryer has been by far the best one for me. Good Luck! Shop around, don't pay $54 for one!",

I love seeing them. The bangs are the worst! Just doesn't seem like they will ever get there. I think the different chemo cocktails make a dif on hair growth, and everyone is different with eyelashes continuing to fall out every few months. I was one of the fortunate ones, mine never fell out after they came in. And the facial hair, I left alone and did not shave and it eventually went away as well. Hang in there girls...it will come........EVENTUALLY! Just seems to take forever, especially for those that had and want long hair. I was one of those.

They have all of the most updated equipment, have everything you would possibly need at one facility, and they CARE. Please call and talk to someone there, or go to their live chat, I am certain it will make you feel better. I did the live chat when I had learned about them and by the next day I had a plane ticket out to Tulsa, and they were taking care of my medical records for me, contacted my insurance to see if I would be covered, etc. I arrived in Tulsa for a 3 day evaluation, ended up so pleased that I stayed for over a week. Had all my tests, surgery to put in a power port for chemo treatments, and my first chemo treatment. I am now here undergoing my radiation treatments. I am about half way done. I don't know all the particulars about my cancer, it is breast, stage 2, I am 50 yrs young, my tumor was approx. 2\" with 2 lymph nodes found to be positive but my surgeon back home did not recall how many nodes he removed!

It seems to have washed out some, but not much, which brings me to wonder if the color is changing. I can't see any change in the color of new growth at the roots. I had also posted earlier back about private areas coming back thick, course and black. That is now gone and back to what it was pre chemo. CC, I took Vit E (for hot flashes tho) and still lost my hair. However, I was told not to take it during radiation. So check with your doctor before starting anything. I have to agree with Nancy,  started to curl after about 4 months. I think it was about inch and a half then. It is now about 2 inches. Lori",

It has been awhile now since my last chemo, I continue to post, only because I want my long hair back. I figure another 2 years. But if these curls don't go somewhere, I don't know if I will be able to handle it long! As far as how your hair comes back. Everyone  is different. My hair started to curl around 5 months, and my more natural color started at about 6 months. And not everyone gets the curls. But I will say........I have MORE gray than I did before! I had never colored my hair, but I can see those days are over! LittleRed, I have a similar story to yours. We were in CA visiting our grandkids. Which we only do about 3 times a year. My grandson, who was 3 was playing in our hotel suite. I was having a hot flash and took my wig off and set it on the table. Not thinking that he had never seen me without it. Well when he glanced my way, he took one of those \"double takes\".....saw my wig on the table...picked it up...and sort of tossed it into my lap, and says \"put your hair back on Grammy\"! And went about his playing. JaneM, I'm sorry too. What a bunch of crap. We wait and wait and wait to get some hair. Then comes the  time when we finally get brave enough to get that first teensy trim, and now you have a to \"wait\" again, for it to grow out. But it will......and when it does.......go to a different stylist! Which is hard to do. I had a great one in Michigan, but I have lived in AZ for 9 yrs....and I have yet to find one that I really like! Hugs to all, Lori",

The curly picture, my hair is still a little wet, so it doesn't show how frizzy it gets. CristlC, I can not manuver a flat iron, so what I use is a large barrel curling brush. I have had it cut twice. I don't much care for the style, but its the only thing I can do with it. When I go out, I think (in my mind) people are looking at me and thinking (about my hair style) \"What was she thinking? Does she actually think that looks good!\") When it was shorter, I used the smaller barrel curling brush. Gel before that, because I would burn my head trying to get the hair around the curling brush. Maybe you could go out somewhere quick and convenient. Like maybe just to get gas or something. Something where you don't have to be out in the \"Public Eye\" for long. You will see, that most people don't pay any mind to us and our hair, and that its all in OUR heads. The headbands do provide a different look when its curly. I used them. I bought some soft cloth, stretchy ones. They had kind of a lacey pattern to them.  Hugs Lori",

Sometimes I hesitate posting pictures, because most of you are either just starting treatment and the hair has or is just falling out, or you have just finished treatment and your hair is just starting to grow. I hope I am not offending anyone or making anyone think that I am throwing it in your face as to how much hair I have. It has been 9 months, I actually thought at the beginning of all this, I would have more hair at 9 months PFC than I do. \"The Curls\" I HATE. Have I said that before! They are really hard to manage, I am hoping that they go away, just like the white colorless stuff went away, and I'll have my regular hair back some day. But if I don't, I will always be thankful to have hair. To me, it never felt \"all of sudden\". It seemed to be taking forever. Doing the pictures helps me see the growth. It will seem like it hadn't grown much, until I look at my picture I took a month previously. Which is why I didn't do weekly pictures, I wanted to make sure I could see progress. Ok, enough about me......sorry! Cinrae, you have probable had the most traumatic experience of anyone on here. I am sorry that your hair came in so thin and pray for you that what you are trying helps to thicken it up. I wish you the very very best. Lainey, I am surprised you remembered me and glad I was able to help someone, thank you for that, makes my heart feel good. I didn't join bco.org until I was almost finished with treatments, which was how I ended up on your thread. Well, I didn't feel like I belonged. I was done and would not be experiencing the same things at the same time as you gals, so I went over to threads with girls at my time frame. On those threads, they had already formed a bond and I felt like I didn't belong there either. I do keep up with the threads, as I had put them in my favorites, I just don't post. Lisa, thank you for the congrats. I am really excited! I hope everyone has a safe and happy holiday weekend. I will post pictures of my makeover if you don't mind. I am excited about that too, and soooo looking forward to it. Happy 4th Lori",

I know I was one of the vain ones, never ever went out without my wig, just not brave enough. So it is a great milestone to reach. Also to those who are done with treatment, or almost done, and beginning to see the hair come in. The only thing with that........IT DOESN'T COME FAST ENOUGH! 5 months PFC is when I could really see the curls, but not long enough to style. So pretty much the only thing I could do was gel and go. It took until 8 months PFC, before I could actually style it. But by the end of the day, between the heat and hot flashes, it is back to its fuzzy/frizzie self. I am now 10 months PFC! .....and still curly! There is a gal here on the threads, she sells products for curly hair. She is in Canada though. Her website, www.ellenoire.com her name is Noelle, the product is Diva Curl. I have not tried it, therefore can not comment on it. My best to all of you, hugs Lori",

The only thing about shaving it that way is you still have that short stubble and it was falling out everywhere. So I guess I would suggest, if you are going to shave, use a razor!

I too used some Natural Instincts, but I thought I read on mine that it was good for 28 washes. I bought a honey blonde. My gray hair turned almost back to my normal strawberry blonde, except a little bit darker. But it did cover all the gray.

The flax seeds are great because these phytoestrogens can take the place of bad estrogens (at the receptor sites) and therefore promote health.  There are studies showing these seeds to benefit patients with ER PR + breast cancer.  I would not worry about taking the flax seeds. I guess I am going to trust his opinion and continue with my flaxseeds. God Bless Us All Lori",

I am so sorry for everyone having a tough time with these damn side affects. All I can say is hang in there, its not forever. The only thing that is forever is worrying about this ugly monster showing its ugly head again. I try not to think about and put it in God's hands.

I love you. P.S.  And, remember... If life happens to deliver a situation to you that you cannot handle, do Not attempt to resolve it yourself!  Kindly put it in the SFGTD (something for God to do) box. I will get to it in MY TIME. All situations will be resolved, but in My time, not yours. Once the matter is placed into the box, do not hold onto it by worrying about it.  Instead, focus on all the wonderful things that are present in your life now. If you find yourself stuck in traffic, don't despair.  There are people in this world for whom driving is an unheard of privilege. Should you have a bad day at work; think of the man who has been out of work for years. Should you despair over a relationship gone bad; think of the person who has never known what it's like to love and be loved in return. Should you grieve the passing of another weekend; think of the woman in dire straits, working twelve hours a day, seven days a week to feed her children. Should your car break down, leaving you miles away from assistance; think of the paraplegic who would love the opportunity to take that walk. Should you notice a new gray hair in the mirror; think of the cancer patient in chemo who wishes she had hair to examine. Should you find yourself at a loss and pondering what is life all about, asking what is my purpose? Be thankful. There are those who didn't live long enough to get the opportunity. Should you find yourself the victim of other people's bitterness, ignorance, smallness or insecurities; remember, things could be worse. You could be one of them!                    Now, you have a nice day.                          God",

I hit the big 5-0 this year and spent it on a plane flying to OK for chemo the following day! I was also suppose to get married in Oct in Hawaii but spent that in OK also doing radiation! Next year hopefully! We had ribs for Thanksgiving dinner, fiancee doesn't care for turkey. As far as fatigue goes, I only had it occasionally during my treatments. I actually feel just as good as I always have, which as been pretty much the case during all of my treatments. I took and still do, lots of supplements. I am on Arimidex for 5 years. Otter - My treatments we done at Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCA). I flew out there every 3 weeks for chemo. 4 hour drive to the airport, 2 hour wait at the airport, 2 1/2 hour flight. Chemo the next day and flew home the following day! Did that 8 times and it acutually earned me a free flight, used that for a family member to come visit me! For radiation, I drove out there and stayed for 2 months. They put me up at the Candlewood Suites for $30 a night. Was a long time to be away from home but I had lots of visitors. My mom, 2 of my brothers, my 2 kids and my fiancee Darrell. It was sure nice to get home. I have to have a check up in 3 months. CTCA is building a facility in Phoenix which is due to open Dec 29th, so I may go there for my follow ups. Not sure yet as I have met so many wonderful ppl in Tulsa. My hair is about an inch long. Appears to be straight and GREY. I hate it! Want my wavy strawberry blonde back. Guess I'll have to find it in a bottle. I never could get enough gumption to go out in public without a wig. I didn't do hats or scarves, I looked like an old lady in them with no eyebrows or eyelashes. We work from home, have an internet business, so I didn't have to worry about co-workers and only go to town once a week....thats a 1 hour drive, one way. Lori",

Helps control sore gums & ulcerated tissue and helps thrush. There is a website on the bottle and an 800 number, not sure I should post that, so if anyone interested, PM me and I will gladly give that info.

The could do mamo, MRI or Ultra Sound, and most likely a biopsy if they think its supicious. I think if it were me, having gone through what I did, I would pass all the tests and say just do the biopsy. However, there are things that can tell them that it is not cancer, with those tests.  I wish you all the best and hope things come out just fine and the only reason for you to come back here would be to tell us adios. But, if things turn out differently, this is a WONDERFUL place to come to. Lots of freinds, a wealth of information and groups are formed all the time with gals that are starting treatments together. So until you know for sure what is going on, please try not to worry about. Prayers for you that everything will be ok. Please let us know what you find out. Hugs, Lori",
