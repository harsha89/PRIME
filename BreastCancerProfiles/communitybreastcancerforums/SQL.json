      "Content": "SQL wrote: I completed my 2nd radiation today today after chemo (FECT) At any rate, i'm a bit confused about why the beam had to go underneath me and they said that it would go through my left shoulder are too. Is that to get to the other lymph nodes???The first rad was different then the second. They told me that every second radiation would involve the placing of the rubber material(forgot the name) over the breast area....anyway, i'll feel a bit better when i understand more. I had five lymph nodes positive. He told me that he would have to go to the other lymph node area but just confused as to the shoulder  and from my underside???I  can't see the rad onc til next week.
