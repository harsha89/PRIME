Keep in mind that I'm not one of those women who had great hair to begin with. Funny you mentioned your grays, because a lot of my grays never fell out.. With my most recent Dx I was going to try to use cold caps, but then my Doc changed my chemo to one that doesn't cause hair loss.",

Now I only have 4 more ibrance to take before I get the week off and I had to take Percocet last night and today because I ache all over. My elbows, back, ribs, legs and even my toes. I normally have a pretty high pain tolerance. I\u2019m hoping when I get the week off, it will go away",
