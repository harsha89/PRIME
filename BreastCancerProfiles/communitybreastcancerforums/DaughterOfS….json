The doctor said it's relatively common and nothing to seriously worry about (especially if there are no symptoms). I believe he said to take omeprazole if the herniabegins to bothers her. I think there is a surgery to repair the hernia if symptoms are severe or problematic.",

My mom also had progression to the liver this year after having bone only mets for 4 years. What a shock! We also thought it was the end and our thoughts went in the same direction. She went from bone only to at least 7 liver lesions (looked like more but they were able to clearly identify 7). We weren't eligible for any targeted liver treatments because she had too many lesions- we were really getting scared. There is a thread on liver treatments on this site with more info. Perhaps you will be eligible for some. My mom started eribulin (halavan) and it has been a miracle drug. She has been on it for a few months and none of the liver lesions showed on her recent pet scan! Her tumor markers also dropped to almost normal range from being quite elevated. So there are options and there aremany drugs that are still available. Let me know if you have any questions. Best of luck.  ",

If it turns out to be clear you might want to try massage. My mother said it was quite painful at first-but issue ompletely cleared up!",

Throughout this experience we've had second opinions (two at) Ucla and one at city of hope. There is no comparison. City of hope was wonderful. We saw Dr. Yuan, and if we were to switch to City of hope we would want her to be my mother's oncologist. At ucla, I have to say we felt rushed. The doctor didn't even review our info before we arrived. We spent most of the time with the fellow and just a few minutes with the doctor. He never even returned our call or email after the appointment. I know you UCLA is top rated, but we were extremely disappointed with both of our visits. City of Hope is an entirely different experience. They treat you like you matter and appoint you a patient advocate on your first visit. I can give you more info if you would like. Best of luck ",

I have tried to find the answer in my own and even asked my mothers onc but haven't really had much luck with an answer. My mother has had stage 4 BC since Aug of 2012. She did great with her intial chemo A/C and then felt great on Arimedex till progression in her liver 2; 4mm areas and 3 areas in bones. The end of Sept she started Faslodex, since then (total of 4 injections) she started having horrible pain in her left hip which started 4 days after the first injection. As time has gone on she has extreme fatigue daily (enough that she can only walk to the living room) nausea and vomiting, no appetite.  She has lost 20 pounds. She has stopped the injections last one 27 days ago. So my question. For those of u who had horrible side effects on faslodex, how long till u felt better. I know the half life of this drug is 40 days. Just want to give my mom some hope. In 2 months she went from working full time, working out and riding her horses to lying in bed. Not good QOL.  Thanks again for ur time. And hope u all enjoy ur Holiday.  Jennifer",

First year was the hardest emotionally, but it has become a new way of life. Depending on where you live there are support groups for both patients and family members that can be very helpful.
