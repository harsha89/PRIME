My mom had breast cancer and then brain cancer and my aunt had breast cancer so it pretty much runs in my family I guess. Last year I found a lump in my breast and I got a mammogram and sonogram done and was told that the results show nothing and I was fine. This year I went back and although I got the same results from the mammo and sono my doctor is panicked (me even more so ) because the lump appears to have gotten bigger and he says my lymph node under my arm seems swollen.He says even though the test show nothing , he can feel it and it's big. I also noticed a small drop of clear discharge that came from my nipple but it was just a drop and nomore. Im going to get a biopsy done tomorrow but I haven't been able to sleep or even think because I'm so scared. The doctor said if it is cancer he's worried because the lump is big already (8 by 5 cm). I just want to know if there's can be another explanation. Let me also state that two weeks before going to the doctor I had a miscarriage at 8 wks. I just want some peace of mind , please can someone give me there thoughts Log in to post a reply",
