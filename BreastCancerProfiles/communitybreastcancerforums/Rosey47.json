I called the Dr. office and asked to speak with someone concerning my biopsy and I needed to know if pieces of the marker were broken inside me, the lady that answered said the Dr. would call me back. He said not to worry the marker didn\u2019t break and that\u2019s the way the marker looked he also mentioned that he went further in grabbing tissue and if I had remembered that, he said it was perfectly fine that sometimes they don\u2019t get the spot and not to worry. Well I\u2019m worried, I don\u2019t think this Dr. was prepared and I don\u2019t think what I experienced is normal, now I have to wait on a pathology report that I don\u2019t know will be accurate because of the biopsy and what if their is something broken inside of me that can\u2019t be seen?
