I will have my first treatment on July 1st and although I am very aware everyone handles chemo in their own way and it is different for most, I would just like to hear how it has gone for people. Were you able to work? travel? did your hair fall out immediately?? anything you are willing to share would be great. Or, is there anyone who will be starting soon, like me, and want to share your experience as you go?? Thanks all!

I appreciate hearing everyone's experiences, as I am sure you all know...it helps me deal with no stressing out too much! I actually work in a school, so I will not be formally working over the summer during my treatment. I do however tutor sometimes (especially in August, which would be toward the end of my treatment) so i was wondering if that would still be possible. I am glad to hear that it should be doable for sure. I was also concerned because we of course had summer plans, nothing to big, but I was just wondering how much would have to change. One more question, i notice that most people on here have their Dx and treatment info under their comments. How do i get mine to show up? Also, I was planning on shaving my head on the 4th of July....my first dose is on July 1, so some (non cancer patients) have told me that that is too soon and I should wait till it starts falling out in case it never does?? Any one have thoughts on if I should wait longer, like till it is actually falling out?? Thanks again all and God Bless you all!",
