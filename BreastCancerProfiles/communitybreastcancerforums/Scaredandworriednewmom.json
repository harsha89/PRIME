I have had breast surgery in 2012 to remove a fibrodema. The ultrasound came back with inhomogenous poorly defined irregular Hypoechoic nodule with some degree of posterior acoustic shadowing. This nodule is taller than wide. All red flags but birad was 0 I was referred to mammogram and the report says its a coarsely calcified fibrodema. No other dominant masses or significant calcifications or soft tissue distortion is seen. I was asked to follow up in 6 months. I just got another ultrasound done and the mass is still there. Birad is 0 and another mammo suggested. Doc refuses mammo as I just had one 6 mnths ago. No change in size of mass though. I have another appt with gp tomm, and i m scared out of my mind. I do not want to wait another 6 months. I have tried googling coarsely calcified fibrodema but dont get clear answers. Anyone knows what this is? Is it beingn? I am in Canada, and getting a specialist appt can take ages and I am freaking out. Pls help. Log in to post a reply",
