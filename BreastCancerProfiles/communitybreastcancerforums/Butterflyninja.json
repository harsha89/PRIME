    "Content": "Butterflyninja wrote: I am scared..so anxious I finally found a place that can do ultrasound without mammo. Because they (radiologist and nurse) think I am still young, (31 going to be 32 this month) I've been recommended by them not to do the mammo (bc of radiation exposure). But they won't just do the ultrasound.. so...I have been just waiting this whole time. Still white discharge in only one breast when squeezed, no lump that I feel, a little different shape than the other breast but not sure it's abnormal. (Like little bumps on duct areas) ob gny doctor checked my breast and he doesn't think it is anything serious but I've been told by other people you won't know until you do ultrasound at least. I am just worrying so much about this. If the ultrasound looks weird.. I'm just gonna do the mammo though... Log in to post a reply",
