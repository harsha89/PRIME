The bras have NO elastic but still manage to stay in place well.  They are made for small breasted women but, as I said, work well for me with no breasts!  They are coming out soon with bras with bigger openings for the pockets, but I managed to get my silicone \"biggest boob\" prostheses in there.  I am so excited about this find I just had to share the news.  Here's the site: www.thezeebra.com  Dx 5/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, 0/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

You could put almost anything in there though. I think so many women who've had mastectomies were buying the bras and asking for this adaptation that they decided to make one for us!    I wear it with the \"forms\" that it comes with if I just want to look \"small breasted\" and it works for me but I am fairly thin and used to looking \"small\".  The bra is just so comfortable, it is like wearing nothing.  Hope this helps. ",

(ha ha) and it was a no brainer to get rid of that one as well and be symmetric, even if flat.  These past 2 years have been a journey of trying various prostheses and bras, and, believe me, I have tried them all.  I mostly go bra-less and find that many tops camouflage very well and folks don't notice.  My latest greatest discovery is a bra called \"Zee Bra!\" which has got to be the absolute most comfortable bra I have had pre or post mastectomies!  I use it w/my silicone boobs and it somehow prevents the sweating and heavy feeling.  It also comes with its own variety of inserts for making your bust as big or small as you'd like!  I am still working through the self-consciousness of my body when naked; I used to have no problem with that at all, but I am getting there and still don't have one bit of regret at being breast-free.  Hope that helps. ",
