I took 8 days off for surgery but am working full-time.  My BS and the rad onco both said that working a full schedule was dependent on how I felt, but they also said that there is really no medical basis for fatigue from just having radiation tx to the breast area only.  Chemo--yes, but not just rads.  The rad onco said in her experience, the fatigue was due mainly to women who were adding one more thing (radiation tx) into an already busy schedule, and from the emotional stress of simply having cancer and all that it entails.   Having said that, I have noticed that I feel more tired this week than before (this was my first full week of tx, today was session #8), but now I am not sure how much of that is psychosomatic.  ",

Had two boost sessions today (one in the AM and the regular one in the PM) to make up for a day when the server was down and no txs were done.  Only two more sessions left!!   I am VERY red now though, and the boost area is now beginning to redden up alot more than it had before.  I'm also quite unhappy with the physical and pigment changes to my nipple and areola and hope they return to \"normal\" after a bit.   The tech told me earlier in the week that I would need to schedule a follow-up app't in about a month, and then again in 6 months, and after that once every year. So not as free from there as I thought initially. And to add to the fun today, I also went to the GYN and had to have my Mirena IUD removed since I am ER+/PR+.  I really liked Mirena, not only for the birth control but I also have not had a period since about a month after I first got it.  Not looking forward to those and the cramping again. ",

The skin is painful to touch, too.   AICa---they already had the mold done before I started my first boost session.  The tech said it was designed from the CT scan.  He popped out a piece of blue rubber from the metal square and added the square to the cone.  He then turned on the machine lights and drew the outline of the area on my breast, which they re-traced again the next day, and apparently will do every day of tx.  They are also still marking both sides of my breast.  I will not miss being marked up like a bad football play chart!",

I am still using Aquaphor however. How coincidental the TSA topic arose here, as I was talking about it with DH yesterday.  I told him that I did not want to fly again, as I do not want to go through the scanner (for various reasons) and also did not feel I should have to endure the degree of pat-down that I have read people are getting.  My breast is still tender and I would likely scream and probably hit someone who squeezed it.  I also feel it borders on molestation for them to actually feel my genitals.  Not just a hand glide over, but a full-on labial grope.  I feel that's a serious violation of my rights--both Constitutional and civil.  It's going to be a major problem for me/us in particular because my husband's family all live in England.   ",

I was told no anti-perspirant so I bought some natural deoderant to use (no aluminum, no parabens), but when asked was told no to that as well, for the reasons mentioned (interferes with radiation).  I was told to use pure cornstarch under my arm and also on my breast to help with moisture absorbtion.  I have been using regular anti-per/deoderant on the weekend, but make sure to completely wash it away from that armpit on Mondays. ",

A few others have mentioned the shooting pains in their breast.  I had that occur only once, but it was very painful. I do feel my breast throbbing often, esp. around my nipple.  My breast is still tender and swollen, and I still can't sleep in my usual position (right side) because it's too painful, so I'm still using a body pillow for comfort and support.   Despite being told that there is no real physical basis for fatigue, I have been feeling significantly fatigued for the past two weeks.  I'm still working full-time but am honestly finding it hard to make it there on time and to get a lot done.  I can't take any time off right now b/c it's such a busy time and I have so much to do.  By the time I get home, I am so tired I can barely move. I'm almost too tired to eat most nights, much less fix dinner.  I wondered if getting B12 injections would help any. Has anyone found them to help any during/after rads? ",

As a result, what should have been a 7-day course is going to up end being about a 14-day course.  I also started taking Tamoxifen on Monday; no SE from that thus far.",
