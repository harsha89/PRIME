A series of case reports: clinical evaluation of a complex homeopathic injection therapy in the management of pain in patients after breast cancer treatment. Orellana Alvarellos G, Ruiz de Viñaspre Alvear P, Kaszkin-Bettag M. Center of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Ginesia SA, Providencia, Santiago de Chile, Chile. OBJECTIVE: In breast cancer patients, posttreatment pain often appears after several months and strongly impairs health-related quality of life. Conventional methods of pain reduction are often ineffective. Injection therapy with Traumeel (Heel GmbH, Baden-Baden, Germany), a medication with analgesic properties used in homotoxicology for treatment of the pain associated with trauma as well as a mediator of inflammation, was proposed as an innovative approach for pain relief after breast cancer treatment. DESIGN: Nine patients, still suffering from a high level of pain after breast cancer therapy despite use of postoperative treatment with conventional analgesics, were invited to participate. A Traumeel and procaine injection was administered once a week for three to 10 sessions. The level of pain was assessed by a pain score and physical and psychological status by a questionnaire before and directly after injection and again at follow-up visits after 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: After the last injection, all patients experienced a marked reduction of their level of pain on average from 7.6 +/- 1.5 to 2.4 +/- 1.4 points on a scale from 1 to 10 points. After a followup observational phase of 3 and 6 months, pain score ratings increased slightly again in some patients but remained consistently low in others. In any case, the ratings of pain levels did not reach the values assessed before the start of Traumeel injection. Similarly, health-related quality of life improved with this injection therapy. The perception of pain relief with Traumeel injection was high in 8 of 9 patients, reflecting an overall perceived positive outcome and tolerability of this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This case series represents a first encouraging approach to using this complex homeopathic injection for pain relief in breast cancer patients.",

So I've had many issues since then... Major pain.. Fat grafting (they take small amounts of fat cells from ur abdomen & insert it into ur \"cleavage\" area.) I had this done 2x b/c supposedly the bones r rubbing against my chest b/c I have no fat there. Well to say the least this hasn't been as successful as I'd prefer. My right foob is a little off to the side, but firm .... My left foob is soft (mushy..lol) & way off to the side. He supposedly fixed it 1x, but it didn't fix all the way b/c he didn't secure the side w/ allorderm. So here I am looking for my 3rd procedure since I had the implants. I want the left one moved over & \"secure\". But b4 I do this, I am thinking that maybe a larger implant would be better.So my question is: has Anyone here had implants (after their exchange) in a while & then had them removed & had larger implants put in BUT DIDN'T have drains?

I have been having major pain in my shoulder blade on the same side as the pain in my breast.  The patch is Flurbiprofen(its an anti inflamortary drug that is Non steriod).  the company that makes it is  Teh Seng Pharmaceutical.  i did some research & it appears it good for ARTHRITIS & other stuff like that. It has NOT taken my pain away completley, but usimng the patch w/ my pain meds has made it tolerable.  My shoulder blade on sat didnt hurt at all after the second time using it. I have not tried it on the part of my breast that hurts, but it has reduced my pain in my breast thru using it on my shouolder blade. of course no of us can say this would help u, but hey i always feel anything is worth a try. i am going to make an appointment w/ my orthopedic dr too & see what is going on w/ my shoulder blade. PT is making it worse..so i will not go back until Fri & see how i am doing then with the use of this patch. I hope that someone here can find relief using this patch..if anyone else has anything that has made their pain a little bit more tolerable, please share",

Ok now that i PM some of u... i hope, i can update pubically!!! i am better then i was a month ago thanks to time, going back to work & mainly medication. I am seeing a great Pain dr & he really understands my pain ....he is giving me stronger medication & is very kind. I wish more women that had pain like i do can see someone like him.  He doesnt ask for urine tests (even though i'd have no problems w/ that) he doesnt want to subject me to 20 million tests which most of them want to...i am very lucky.  now that things r calmer, i can expalin more abt my pain. 1rst the left side shifted a lot..we dont understand why, but supposedly it is not a big deal to fix. If it wasnt for all the problems i have had it would of been fixed a while ago.  My cleavage area is a BIG space ...& the BS took all my breast tissue out ( i guess u have breast tissue there too) & now i have skin rubbing against bone & this appears (which i have complained abt since day 1) to be my issues. So when i have my revison surgery my dr is going to get fat cells from my belly using a small needle & insert it into that area.  he can even do this in the office, but he feels since he is going to over fill me in the begining, it will be best to do this when we have the revison surgery. Many times he uses this for more cosmetic purposes then for medical purposes.  He tried to make me feel good by telling me if this works, he is going to write up an article abt this & have it published.  Hey if this helps me, maybe it can help other women too. My implants itself dont hurt.  i do have some swelling on the rt side, but that is more from my shoulder blade when it acts up , it effects my breast. When i tried PT for my shoulder blade, it made my breast unbearable & i had to take my medicine every 4 hrs!! i was seeing stars. I am back to work f/t b/c emotionally its the best, physcially it is very hard!!! Now my boss has increased my hrs 3 days a week for a 1/2 hr b/c we have more kids in the after school program. 1rst i am the only head teacher that has to work the after school program & 2nd she doesnt understand as the day goes on it gets harder & harder...many ppl think that b/c ur back to wk, ur fine...i am far from fine.my boss said come in a 1/2 hr later & that doesnt work either, b/c earlier in the day its easier, as the day goes on it gets harder. I wish ppl would understand this..& then i get thrown in my face that i got pd through out my time off. I am thankful for that...but i didnt ask to be pd & that was ur nice choice to pay me, but DONT throw it in my face!!! I hate a \"gift horse gift\"... i started to wear a bra for a short period of time & was so happy to take it off too!! But when i have my revison surgery i have to wear support, so i am trying to get used to wearing 1. Plus it does look a lot better!! I am a \"B\" cup now, so i was happy abt that.  when i look down @ my feet i c my feet!!! I know so many woman want to be bigger..i never wanted to..i always wanted to be small. I havent been a \"B\" since elementary school!!! lol I HOPE everyone is enjoying their holidays (if u celebrate holidays) ..this is another pet peeve of mine..that in stores & even dr's why do they automatically wish u a happy easter? Many ppl dont celebrate Easter...how abt have a nice day or good wkend..leave out the holidays ...or just say happy holidays!!lol take care all!! hugs!!",

Department of Anesthesiology, University of California at San Diego, USA. Breast surgery is a common procedure performed in women. Many women who undergo breast surgery suffer from ill-defined pain syndromes. Although there exists a few reports on the incidence of post mastectomy pain, there are no published reports on chronic pain after breast reconstruction. This investigation attempts to characterize the pain after four types of breast surgery: (1) mastectomy, (2) mastectomy with reconstruction, (3) cosmetic augmentation, and (4) breast reduction. A questionnaire was mailed to 479 women who underwent breast surgery at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center between January 1988 and December 1992. A second mailing was sent to women who did not respond to the first mailing. Women were divided into four groups; mastectomy, mastectomy with reconstruction, cosmetic augmentation, and breast reduction. In the mastectomy and mastectomy with reconstruction groups, only women who had a lumpectomy with axillary dissection, a modified radical mastectomy, or a radical mastectomy were used in the study. 59% of the women responded. The incidence of pain occurring at least one year after surgery in the mastectomy + reconstruction group (49%) was significantly higher than the mastectomy (31%) and breast reduction (22%) groups. Thirty-eight percent of the women with breast augmentation complained of pain. Women who had reconstruction using breast implants had a higher incidence of pain (53%) than those without (30%). The pain incidence in women who had reconstruction without implants was identical to women who had a mastectomy without reconstruction. There was no relationship between the use of silicone or saline implants and pain (22% and 33% respectively). However, the submuscular placement of the implants resulted in a significantly higher incidence of pain (50%) than the subglandular placement (21%). Of the women that reported pain, arm pain was significantly higher in the mastectomy and mastectomy + reconstruction group (56% and 42%, respectively) as compared to the breast reduction group (0%). Most patients reported intermittent pain in all groups. Of the women that reported pain, the mastectomy and mastectomy + reconstruction group had higher pain related to movement (41% and 42%, respectively) than the augmentation and breast reduction groups (15% and 9%, respectively). The peak pain intensity was significantly higher in the augmentation group as compared to the mastectomy group. Our incidence of post mastectomy pain is higher than most reports. The incidence of breast pain is highest in the mastectomy + reconstruction and augmentation groups which is assumed to be secondary to breast implants. Every effort should be made to achieve the best cosmetic result in breast reconstruction which in many cases justifies the use of breast implants. However, these women should be counseled on the possibility of developing chronic pain. PMID: 8880841 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Publication Types: MeSH Terms:",

The MRI was supposed to be a ½ hr, but instead it was an 1hr on that table & even though they have cushions, it hurts laying like that. After the MRI, they wanted to do an Ultrasound & I gotta tell you, the radiologist was a real jerk!!! I think he has a fetish w/ implants...he wanted to know why I was having this done. I said it was b/c I have been having swelling for several months now  & it's not getting any better, if anything, it swells more & gets hard.  If my implants were like this all the time, it wouldn't be so bad, b/c the right side fills a bra cup better & looks better...lol..it just feels weird & hurts @ times...so this radiologist  kept moving my implants & he asked why they were not even...he said my left one that I just had fixed is still to the side & basically b/c it looks \"lopsided\" (not the word he used, but it meant that) I am getting the feeling its swollen...UM.....NO!!!!!! I know the difference when something is swollen..he said my skin is NOT thickened so its not swollen....he kept moving both implants towards the middle...I came so close to saying something to him ....there was a woman in the room with us. I don't think he was doing it b/c he really has a fetish, but still..a little more sensitivity would have been nice. So he suggested I go back to my PS & my BS of course goes by what they say. So thank goodness there is no leak or any fluid..now just to figure out what is going on & what to do abt it...oh what fun more dr's!! Just what I need now @ wk..my boss said to me that if I have any more surgeries or have to keep going to the DR I wouldn't be able to work there..its so nice to have support. Think I like having these surgeries? Think I like being in pain & going to DR's? NO!! thx for listening..more to come !!! Tink xoxoxo",
