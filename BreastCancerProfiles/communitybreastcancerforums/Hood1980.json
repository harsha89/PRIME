Keep your own historical records for your own peace of mind.  It's good to have last year's record to compare to your most recent tests. I don't know your doctor, but from a woman that has had many a doctor check her breasts, they all talk while they are massaging/checking your breasts.  It's probably part of their training to help ease the patient's anxiety.  I too have a lumpy breast and it's the one I still have.  That sneaky cancer was hiding out in the other more desnse less lumpy one, go figure.  I agree with momof 3boys.  Be thankful your doctor is being proactive and requesting an mri now.  My cancer went undetected through years of mammograms, ultrasounds & biopsies.  When I was finally referred for an mri, I had a 4.5 cm tumor.  The lump I found myself & was never detected by mammo or US!  Breast mri's were relatively new when I had mine & I wish every woman diagnosed has having dense of fibrocystic breasts would be referred for an mri. We are all here for you.  I know it's scary, but it is probably nothing.  But with dense breasts, please be vigilant with your breast exams & trust your gut if you think something needs to be checked out.  Take care!",
