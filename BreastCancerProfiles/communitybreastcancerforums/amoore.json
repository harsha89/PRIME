I actually had an infection in my nipple and had to have surgery on it over two years ago. however, in the past 6 months they started to puss. I know it was puss because of the awful smell. I called my doctor, they had no idea, I posted on forums nobody had any idea. I thought for a while maybe it's milk (i've been known to lactate when my sister was pregnant). I was so confused. My nipples have been so sore. So, i realized i had some puss on my favorite bra which i wear all the time so i decided to hand wash it in the sink. My bra turned the sink water dark grey. It was disgusting. And then it hit me - DUh! I barely wash my dang bra. For the first time I put triple antibiotics around my nipple and have been wearing only clean bras. I know this seems like its a no brainer but it just didn't occur to me that I needed to wash my bra more often than what i did. My nipples are not aching and I am not producing and puss. So my advice for you, if you're producing any kind of liquid from you nipples make sure you keep it clean and switch out your bras to make sure you don't get an infection like i did.  ",
