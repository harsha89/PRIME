The procedure itself wasn't terrible, oh ,but it wasn't good either. It was what came immediately afterward that shocked the pants off of me! I believe the woman holding pressure on my breast was squeezing as tight as she could for a total of about 5 minutes! I was crying out in pain! I felt that that much pressure was totally unnecessary and beyond cruel and unusual punishment. Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just a wimp? Should I complain to someone?

My thought is that a woman should not have to go through that much pain, and it makes me wonder if the intense pressure(pain) would be the culprit of future damage to the breast. I did complain to the place I had it done and a risk management nuse got back to me and said that she would investigate. I'll write back and let you know the outcome.",
