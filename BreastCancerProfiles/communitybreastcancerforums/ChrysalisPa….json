Steroid induced perhaps. My friend had breast cancer and will celebrate her five year survival this Spring.  It gives hope!  I hope the SE's are being kind to all.  Everyone having to endure the cold weather, keep warm!  And, I hope we might all sleep easy tonight. I am sure gonna give it my best shot right about now. Goodnight all,  Sandy",

I worked it up in my mind to be much more than it turned out to be.   I found the forum a little while back.  I have been reading some and attempting to educate myself.  I happened to see the group for those in chemo Jan 2009. and decided to go ahead and sign up. This morning it all became very, very real. It is wonderful they have a site like this, and where we can get some support and give some support, as well.  I look forward to meeting and getting to know everyone.  I will be keeping good thoughts for all.",
