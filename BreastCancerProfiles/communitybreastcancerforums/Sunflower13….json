I have family history, on both sides, of many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, uterine, cervical, colon... Just to name a few. Knowing that the process of counseling and actually getting to surgery can take years I started my research about cancer before I even had breast and started research about preventative measures as soon as they were available. Does anyone know of a good resource here in AZ? I am not too concerned about genetic testing, as many people without BRCA1 or 2 still end up fighting the beast. Also, anyone on here choose prophylactic surgery without genetic testing? Anyone take preventative measures before having their children? Thanks so much for any answers!
