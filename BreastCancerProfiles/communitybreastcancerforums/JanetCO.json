I had the nuelasta the day after chemo but at 1 week check my WBC was still very low. I also had a sore tonsil so I got an antibiotic too because one time it absessed. The next day I had to go in and get rechecked count was up to normal. My oncologist said it must have been combo because one shot of nuepogena wouldn't have fixed it.",
