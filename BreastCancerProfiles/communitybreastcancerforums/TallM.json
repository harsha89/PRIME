Pertz1- I'm sorry to hear your breast is red! That's what mine was when I was Dx. Red, hard, hot, itchy, peely. I was Dx w/inflammatory breast cancer. So do they think you have that OR do they think it's a mastitis (an infx). That's what I though mine was then I found my lymph nodes were swollen. I was put on Keflex. Just depends on what the dr wants to use. Its similar to an infx you'd get if you were breast feeding. You prob know that already though. It can be pxful but I hope you can get it under control & move forward. Thanks for all the hair tips! It really is a delima. So true that when the hair is gone there's no hidding that we have ca:o At this point I still have quite a bit of hair. It may just get thin but I too want to control the outcome.

Knowing your out there making it gives me strength. It helps me get through the rough moments:) Be Strong & I promise to do the same! Big Hugs to all- Malinda You sound like me. Go go go. I love to keep busy but I think our bodies are saying hey you-take a break:) I hope your job understands.

I won't be going 7 days a week much longer just till the brain Chemo is done. Sometimes getting the fluid right to the cells can be so helpful. I can't believe the difference after I go. If you have bad headaches you may want to look into doing some. They just use Lactated ringers (electrolytes) & always give me cytrol (for nausea-standard to most pts) & Dexomethosone (steroid) different for all. It takes about 1 & 1/2 hrs.

The food choices do seem tone similar & definitely change:) I'm craving pickles, humas, yogurt, & veggies are starting to taste good esp tomatoes. Even apples which at first bleak. Well today's spinal infusion didn't happen:o I have a Chemo face rash from the Tykerb (brain med), fever & was just to take more brain Chemo methotrexate via the spine. (They remove some spinal fluid & replace it w/Chemo). Its really not painful just the SE=total exhaustion. Only a couple more weeks of that then they'll switch to Herceptin via the spin. Then another MRI & only body Chemo:) The countdown is on. Eonough on me & that! What do you guys do when you feel well? Any fun activities/movies/hobbies that are fun & don't tire you out? barbyjean-thanks for the info on Vit B. I've cut all vits out but wil have to look into that one. lizzybc-sorry to hear you have to go through that kind of px! I wish you the best. They say it gets worse before it gets better. Not sure it's true but I'd say your due for some good! dia123-rubbing your hair off:( I'm not ready for that. Is your head tender? However I no longer need to shave. That's a bonus & saves much time & energy. Good luck all! It's the tough days that will make us stronger. Sigh. Hugs- Malinda",

The mind is so powerful & my music training has taught me this:)  perts1- I LOVE Tappys bi-line. So true! As for the hemmroids I too have the nasty things. Have you tried Tucks? This maybe TMI but it totally helps. I use the Tucks pads to cool between D isssues (helps the bleeding px too) & will often use 1-3 per session (as many as I need) just to get through. The witchazel is so refreshing! My ing also gave me a foam I use 2xs a day (morning/night) w/an applicator-Ahhh. Then my ing gave me some Hydrocortizine cream 2.5% that I use for my bottom 1-4 times in between. Sorry for the TMI but it really is helping. I'm also taking lomotil till I can stop/control the D. I've heard that one of the ladies on here takes 1 imodium (OTC) a day & that seems to help her. Don't know if any of that's helpful for you but there it is:) I hope you all have a great day.

Also no BP, blood draws or anything from the arms after the lymph (even the centinal node is removed) but then that's your choice & between you & your Drs.

There is a fine line of diarrhea/constipation w/my med (chemo/oral) I'm sure you all have simiaar situ. I've founda prunes to be helpful too. I go between lomotil (antidiarhea, some like immodium) & colace (stool softener). Everyone is diff but the hems are so pxful. The tucks are priceless as are the savs like aquaphor, hydrocortisone cream (RX) & Dibucaine ointment 1% (OTC). I know I've mentioned these before but I can't believe how much these have helped me. Also a good cleanser is one by cetiphil. It's even nice on the hems. It's really gentle & not harsh. Hope this helps Someone. In an earlier post I nmentioned that I did some reflexology. It's actually called a Foot Zone. The difference is that Foot Zones not only move things around BUT also work with the energys & helps things move by energy & not a forced movement. I'm usually not one of those \"wowo\" people but found that it really helps & works for me. Non-invassive & I feel SO much better after I have them. What do you ladies do to feel better? Wow-so many great ladies on her & YOUNG! Just shows cancer doesn't care who it goes after:o Nancy- Have you tried yogurt to help replace the good bacteria in your gut? There a good Greek yogurt called Choban that has the fruit in the bottom. That way you can control how sweet or bitter you like. I also put honey on top to help sweeten it if I need more. I try to have 1-2 a day of those (or as many as you want. Its similar to a probiotic idea. perts1- I hope it's not a lymphodema:o You've had enough to deal w/. Are they going to give you an antibiotic or just keep a watch. Have they talked to you about exercises to help w/the swelling? Movment/exercises can be helpful. Have they talked tonyou about seeing a lymphodema specialist? They can actually help the body re-route the way the lymph nodes swell & help them drain. dia123- My mom is a 13 yr breast cancer survivor. However she had a completely different kind (Infiltratng invassive lobular interductal breast cancer w/lymph involvement. She has lymphoma but uses her arm. She was told not to use it but finds that if she does there's less px/swelling. She's had celulutis a couple if times (& put in the hospital 1x for it) but has been really lucky since & at the sign of any redness she goes on an antibiotics & is fine. We didn't know what was happening the first when ca was new & her arm got red streaks/blotches first, warm, swollen & she got a fever etc. Anyway-an FYI Tappy- Your health is first & for most. Hard to hear I know. I love my jobs but I'm realizing going back to the university to teach next semester may be too soon:( I hope to return but I have to heal & take time for me. I also LOVE my work at the urgent care center they've told me my job will be there when I come back & they don't want me to even worry about my job. I've only been there 1 month & 1 month sick. If you've been at your job as long as you have & are that loyal people are usually willing to help out. Every situ is different & I hope you can get some help from them. Have you applied for SSI? I have but it takes about 6 mo to start. I can't wait to get back to work & a somewhat normal life but right now I'm 7 days a week & it's all I can do to make all the appointments. Life definitely is interesting. Never a dull moment. Hang in there. There as saying my aunt in New Zealand says \" All for a purpose.\" We don't always know why things happen but it usually works out better in the end than we could have made it. I hope you all have a great day. I'm off to my spinal Chemo today which means I'm strong enough! WOOT! WOOT! The countdown begins again!

I've used prunes & eat those & that seems to help a little. Prune juice may also help get things moving (I haven't tried that yet but have thought about picking some up). Also carbonation seems to help. It help burping & releasing some of that gas:) Good Luck:) Reflux-no real suggestions there. I take the prilosec & it helps a little. I just have to remember to take it BEFORE I eat (I forget frequently:o). Hair-ya much easier to \"pretend\" your healthy when the hairs not gone. I keep trying to tell myself I'm not ugly w/o hair, just morphed:o My family says people don't see me the same bald. They see me as brave & fighting. So I try to think of that. We are brave & bald. WIMusic-I'm glad you enjoyed your boys & had a good time:) I think if you keep saying Chemo will be a breeze it will. What do you have to lose? Picture yourself feeling well & visualize how you'll be after. I guess it's worth a shot. I've totally been using my mind & visualizing & I think that's why the Drs are SO amazed @ the results:) I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Have a good weekend all!

I'm trying to prep myself to shave mine off. I no longer need to shave so I'm pretty sure I'll lose my head hair. I want to be in control & NOT let the cancer say when it comes out.

They have nice little purse/pocket sizes @ Walgreens. 2) Dibucaine Ointment 1% is a nice change too. Some things work better than others so I hope these are helpful.
