When something threatens our loved ones we react in a very similar manner.  My wife has never been as special as she is now. The mastectomy 'per-se' does not fuss me, nor does the loss of Sanji's beautiful hair.  The misery it has caused her does. Sanji is not coping too well with her first dose of chemo, and watching her suffer with the knowledge that there is another 5 months to go is daunting. I do hope the journey for all of you is an easier one. Most people who have never been touched by breast cancer (including me until recently) are of the opinion, \"big deal, chop it out, end of story\". Wrong!  Beginning of story! I am not trying to sound negative, but not all almonds are sugar coated. On a positive note! Those of you who have been diagnosed with HER2+. Sanji has been offered the chance to participate (we have accepted) in a clinical worldwide trial of a new drug called lapatinib (tykerb). This drug is more effective in blocking the receptors than trastuzumab (herceptin). There are four alternative treatment arms - herceptin on its own, tykerb on its own, tykerb in conjunction with herceptin and herceptin followed by tykerb.  All of these treatments are randomly selected by computer - you or your oncologist have no say. The treatment lasts for 52 weeks. The drug tykerb is administered orally, six times daily, as opposed to the intraveneous hercepton at a hospital every three weeks. The trial \"will involve approximately 8,000 patients in 50 countries throughout the world\". Only \"early breast cancer\" patients with HER2+ receptors are eligible. The trial is termed ALTTO (Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation) Check with your oncologist. After watching my dear wife being jabbed with needles on countless occasions, plus the seemingly endless trips to hospital, tykerb seems like a distant brilliant light at the end of the tunnel. Hang in there all of you. By the way, lime juice cordial helps to remove the metallic taste from Sanji's mouth, (chemo) baked beans or cheese and lettuce sandwiches seem to agree with the stomach!",

      "Content": "Apr 29, 2008 12:18AM The_Other_Half wrote: Hello ladies, I trust you will accept the participation of a distressed but empathetic husband in this room.  If not then I will not bother you again. My dear wife of 16 years was diagnosed with early breast cancer in February of this year. Sanji is 41. The surgical oncologist recommended a lumpectomy to remove the 20mm malignant tumour. We followed his advice. The operation was performed on 3rd of March. Two primary lymph nodes were also removed. The breast wound was not painful, the armpit was. Ten days later we expected to receive the all clear - 6 weeks of daily radiotherapy to protect the breast, problem gone. Not so! The pathological report showed that whilst the lymph nodes were clear, the cancer was grade 3 (had grown to 40mm in 2 weeks), was ER+, PR+, HER2+. Back under the knife on 17th March for a complete mastecomy. We were both shattered. Sanji had never cut her hair. We bit the bullet and had her hair cut very short on 7th April. The hairdresser plaited her hair, then gave me the scissors to \"cut the umbilical cord, the beginning of a new life\". We purchased a synthetic wig, shoulder length, similar colour for $575. We were prepared!? Chemo started today (28th April). Eight cycles at 3 weekly intervals of \"Doxorubican\" and \"Cyclophosphamide\". This is to be followed up with 18 cycles at 3 weekly intervals of \"Herceptin\", followed by 5 years of hormone therapy. I am a fiercely protective and supportive husband, but feel as if my arms and legs have been amputated. How do your husbands/partners cope? I trust ALL of you are posting five or ten years hence. Best wishes from Australia.",
