My daughter took me to my second treatment and left with about half an hour to go and two friends from work came to pick me up and took me out to eat before dropping me off at home. My mom is going with me to the next treatment. Sorta makes me nervous because she is the type that may need entertained LOL. We will see how it goes. My husband doesn't get paid if he misses work, so he probably won't ever come to any of my last 3 treatments. He would if I asked and his bosses wouldn't mind at all, but our finances are stretched thin. I asked the nurse practioner who did my chemo education if it was unusual for people to come alone and would they think there was something wrong with me if I did LOL - she said no, but that I should take my friends up on the offer to come as it helps them to feel involved.Â  Most people at my infusion site have their spouse with them. There isn't room for more than one person, although my nurse did let both my freinds come back. I had already completed my treatment and was just waiting for him to unhook me and let me go. I did ask my 15 year old son if he wanted to go, but made sure he understood it was okay if he didn't. He doesn't want to, he's busy trying to have a normal summer through all of this. Tina",
