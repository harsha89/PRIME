I had the mam and a quick scan, after which the doctor told me all was fine but the problem is although the doctor and mam could not feel or find anything i can still feel the lump but i can only feel it when i am lying in a hot bath or in bed when relaxed. The lump is about one and a half cm in diam......should i ask for a second opinion or am i just being paranoid?? My mum had a mastectomy 3 yrs ago after having 4 tumors in breast...
