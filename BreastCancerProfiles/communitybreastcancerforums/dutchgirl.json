Lumpectomy and 1 lymphnode  involved. Only I am hormone negative. The 11th will be my first chemo. Hope all goes well for you the first chemo. Let me know how it went. Yesterday I had the Muga scan. Thursday the port. Yesterday I had some pictures taken for the passport I need (the old one is already out dated oops) I figured, might as well have the picture taken now while I still have hair. Allthough I am scared of the chemo treatments, I also cannot wait to start, at least I am fighting it then.",

Normally I am not so scared for hospitals etc, but now I have this nightmare that they will push that thing in to far, and hit my heart or something. And then my heart will stop blah blah blah.. you get the nightmare thoughts right? I read that so many of you have this line under their names, how do you do that? How would I have to \"write\" mine. surgery was 19 dec, the tumor was 2.3 cm, 1 lymph node involved, he took 17 nodes out though (because I had in infection above the tumor, that is how they discovered the tumor, many lymph nodes were swollen. But luckely only one was having cancer cells in it.) They said it was hormone negative, but I am still waiting on the HER test. Doc said she was guessing it was neg also, but she had to be sure ofcourse. I know I am in stage 2, but the rest??",

The water was way to much so I felt realy sick to my stomach, threw up at night, had a good night sleep en now the meds are working good and I feel I am over the worst part now. A cat scan on friday and then the second chemo on march 3. Yesterday I felt a little sorry for myself. First an inch long needle in the port that was not healed yet. So ouch! And then I was the only on in the chemo room for the longest time. Half way through 1 other lady came in but she was on a \"I don't want to talk to anybody\" mode, and closed the curtains before she said hi or anything. O well, luckely my husband was off during the day so he could come with me, and next time I will bring a good book.",

(Steinbach, close to Winnipeg to be precise) We now live here for a year, the first 5 years we lived in Edmonton Alberta. I am very glad I found you girls. It helps to read I am not the only one going through this. The wig stories were funny, I got the same giggles when my husband and I went to get one. I was lucky that the cancer care gave us one for free to use as long as needed. It is a new one even! I already cut off my long hair to a short style and made sure it was not so nice looking as the wigg, that way it will be a step forward instead of backwards. With wigg I actually look nicer now haha We try to stay as possitive as we can in this house hold, although it sometimes is so scary that I panic. We try to keep in mind that it is useless to fear stuff that might not even happen to me, and if it will happen we have time enough to flip. But it sure is very difficult sometimes. Especially knowing that we have small children, it is hard not to be scared for the future. Silly isn't it, a few months ago I was worry free, fearless... and now... brrr. Don't even want to think about it how scary life looks sometimes. But we will get over this girls.. right?",

But the nice thing is that I can have chemo now with the port. They (docters) told me that chemo was to hard on the veins for a normal IV. O well, just an other step taken down the road I have to go. I have been reading a lot of different chemo's here, is there any person who gets the same as me? I will be having 3 cycles of FEC and then 3 cycles of Docetaxel. All of them 3 weeks apart.",

I am very scared, it is all going so fast. not even 3 months ago I thought I was a healthy young woman, and look at me now. I had a 2.3 cm tumor in my left breast, and 1 lymph node involved. The blood veasels around did not show signs of transportation of cancer cells. It was hormone negative. That is pretty much all I know. Hope I can join you girls here, because I could realy use some girl power!",
