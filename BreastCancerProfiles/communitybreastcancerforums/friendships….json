For a few weeks both after my MX and after my exchange I woke up during the night hot and sweaty only to later wake up freezing after having tossed off the covers. It had been many years since I experienced hot flashes (while on Tamoxifen) and I have no idea what caused this now. I did take my temperature to make sure I wasn't running a fever...I wasn't. Have you too made sure you don't have a fever? Happily, the sweats and flashes went away both times after a few weeks and now nearly 2 months after my exchange I'm sleeping comfortably again! I sincerely hope you soon will be too! Sam2u, I'm sorry you are dealing with the sloshing. I didn't have sloshing but after my MX I tried to talk my BS into removing my drains when I was at my first follow up appointment. He told me my output was too high for that and if he did remove the drains I could end up having to come back in to have fluid drained. In any case, I think you should call your doctor and describe your situation so you find out what's going on and not have to worry about it.Â ",
