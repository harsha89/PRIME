Before long, like many of you, this will be a distant memory that we'll hold close as we continue to pray for a cure and to help other courageous mothers, sisters, aunts and daughters. Both my mother (single mastectomy) and aunt (lumpectomy/ovarian) are survivors of the bc beast. Also, in the midst of my diagnosis, my sister-in-law (single mastectomy) also discovered she had ovarian and had a hysterectomy.  On Thursday I do the sentinel node dye and the plastic surgeon will mark the area in the evening.  I'm not sure what my emotions will be like on Friday, but I've experienced this journey as an observer when my mother battled this beast in 2002.  For all of you who have conquered, currently conquering or will conquer this monster I pray for your continued blessings.   I've found the hospital pack lists very helpful and the recommended reading helpful.  I'll provide an update after I begin my fight with the beast later.",
