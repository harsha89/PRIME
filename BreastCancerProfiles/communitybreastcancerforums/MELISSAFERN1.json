    "Content": "MELISSAFERN1 wrote: I HAD BREAST SURGERY 3 MONTHS AGO TO REMOVE ALL THE SUSPICIOUS MICROCALCIFICATION THEY FOUND IN MY LEFT BREAST. THE AREA REMOVED WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF MY PINKY. I RETURNED TO WORK 2 WEEKS LATER. 8 DAYS AGO I STARTED HAVING SEVERE SHARP SHOOTING PAINS IN THAT BREAST. I LEFT WORK AND SAW MY SURGEON THE NEXT DAY. HE SAID IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE TORN A CHEST WALL MUSCLE. IS THAT COMMON?? NO ONE TOLD ME IT WOULD TAKE 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR TO HEAL AND I'VE DONE LOTS OF HEAVY LIFTING IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF. I AM SCARED TO DEATH TO GO BACK TO WORK. IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK NOW AND I AM STILL IN PAIN, OUT OF WORK AND WORRIED. HAS ANYONE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR SYMPTOMS AND IF SO CAN YOU HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON???????????? Log in to post a reply",
