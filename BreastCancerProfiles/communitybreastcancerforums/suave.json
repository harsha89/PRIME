Assuming it is benign, you will be worrying for nothing. Assuming it is cancer, then the sooner the better. Hopefully though, it is not cancer and you will be happier this way. But, taking out the lump is a good way to stop worrying.",

We all make mistakes, no one can ever say they have not made mistakes. But we all need to admit what we do and go on. We all get sick sometime and we all will someday get very sick. But, as long as we are alive, we owe to ourselves to fight the good fight. Picture yourselve relaxing while the doctor makes the decisions or if you want you can join your doctor in the decisions. So, go to your doctor like a tourist, pretend they are serving on you everytime they do a check up. You might not have cancer, but if you do you have a fighting chance and your family will be grateful to you for trying. You will hurt them more by not trying. Since you love them so much, you need to try. You also need to be a good example to them. You teach them to not give up because there is always hope. Hope is what keeps me going when I feel exausted. I also trust in God.",

Going to the doctors is better than staying home. At home, your chances of getting better are 0 compare to seeing a doctor. On a side note: If you are so terrified of chemo, maybe you don't have to. This is a true story. In the church I go to, a mom, probably close to 60 years of age, had stage 4 breast cancer. She had a double mastectomy done and then, they put her on a pill. She already had mets to the spine. By the way with mets to the bones, people go on to live another 20 years. She went for bone scan every 6 months. At the last bone scan they found nothing. The pill alone had done it and alot of prayers. What happens is that if a person have stage four, they often start with the pill and follow the progress carefully. Another fellow mom,who was very young with stage 4, had the surgery done but did not want chemo nor radiation. She instead found a natural doctor who combines natural medicine with conventional check ups. She does spend alot of money, but she is cancer free for about 4 years now. She was very young at the time of diagnosis. She is the one who talked to me when I was diagnosed. She believes in the surgery but not in chemo. So you can go to the doctor, at least find out exactly what you have. If you need surgery do it and maybe you will only need the pill. Tell your family. They deserve to cry with you and they deserve the chance to help you in your journey. When I was diagnosed I got depressed. My mother in law spent alot of money to buy special foods for me. I did not want to eat. But you know what, you love yor family, so eat. God bless you. If you want you can pm me. I could pray for you and your family.",
