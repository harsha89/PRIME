I was told that it would be tamoxifen for 5-10 yrs? I have read that femera is better than tamoxifen for ILC patients. Does anyone have any thoughts on this? Hugs and love to all",

I have alternated the last 4 nights between a fever with chills or a fever with night sweats (have to hate both when ambien won't let you sleep through either)! At least I get to see the PS tomorrow, but unfortunately he will probably need/want to operate on Wednesday to remove what we now believe to be the infected drain/implant I really don't like the thought of that especially since I was just starting to have moments of lucidity from note needing meds as often as I was (loved ones say I'm overdoing, it) I can't wait to see what the Dr says since he sent me home with exercises that I probably haven't done enough of. Oh well appointment at 3 pm today so I guess we'll just have to wait and see what the verdict is then. Whoever is right, it will be me stuck on that table again.  ",

I've been MIA due to yet another infection in my left implant which has now been removed completely. What was supposed to be a day surgery turned into a 2 day hospital stay due to my blood pressure being extremely low finally figured out that it was due to a UTI that my body was battling as well. After my 1st sX, I was wearing tank tops with loose fitting button down tops which worked great at hiding the effects left behind from BMX. I'm at a bit of a loss at this point now that I am lopsided one implant and one without. Any suggestions out there? Symmetry is now out of the picture at least for now. I actually saw it tonight for the first time and it looked even worse than I imagined. I'm so tired of this emotional roller coaster and I'm not even sure if I really care what I look like to other people. I feel so defeated since things were going pretty well even with the setbacks. I should have been back to work by now and after all of the delays have happened I'm not sure what we'll do financially I can't expect them to hold my job forever! Although they are being very understanding. I met another medical oncologist last week we will meet with another one tomorrow. To compare treatments. The first one suggested that I do FAC for four treatments, followed by 12 weeks of taxol. Then some shot that starts with an L and the femara. It is all so scary especially by the fact that my body couldn't handle 2 infections at the same time with my immunity system still in tact. Maybe I'm over thinking things but sometimes it is very difficult keeping out the fear! Thanks for listening! Melinda",

But it's ok though I probably would have started to think about side effects soon enough. I came here when I searched on intimacy after dx. I'm 52, still having a period but experiencing menopausal symptoms so let's just say sex before dx was a mental prep for me. But since I got my dx, I really don't care to even attempt. That being said, my DH who is normally a big butt when he doesn't feel he's gotten enough sex has been very understanding. He has been so sweet and understnding at least for this week. Trying to take care of me, rubbing my Who is this masked man? Lol. It has been so nice that we attempted sex twice (at my prompting) this week a record breaker for me...lol. But both times I was not able to let's just say cross the finish line. Seriously! Breast cancer has even stolen good sex from me too and haven't really started this rodeo yet. I have just began this journey and all I know is I have stage 1 ILC. They say I'm a candidate for a lumpectomy but I think that scares me more then the alternative. First instinct was \"cut those dang puppies off\"! I mean really why not give yourself the best odds from the get go. So now I am waffling between a single or a double and as you all well know, I'm not referring to a burger. Getting 2nd opinions for all docs so I can be completely knowledgeable when make all of my upcoming life altering decisions. Thanks god you know how hard it is for me to even decide where to go out to dinner...ugh! That problem is cured though as I really don't want to eat these days anyway. Needless to say I am frantcally still looking for anwsers so I can live with those decisions later. I feel like I'm sinking in all of this sea of crap and I'm about to go under without a life vest. But enough about me...I will be prayerful for you all and your complete victory in this battle. And thanks for sharing your stories making me both laugh and cry...which is a good thing cuz it means I'm still alive. Hugs and love to all and goodnight oh I mean morning.

I think right now my brain is processing too much new information, new emotions and fear of what is yet to come that it can't stop long enough to enjoy the moment. But I am putting an event in my phone for a later date to remind me to scream...lol. It is now actually something to look forward in a way...courage to talk about sex with anyone other than my dh about sex and the look on the Dr's face when I ask for it...I hope it embarrasses him/her as much as I will be asking for it. My dh would say I am kind of a prude, but that really isn't it, I was just not exposed to discussions my mother never said the word sex much less talk about it, hence it is awkward for me. Indenial, thanks for the encouragement as well as your words of wisdom that I will definitely consider as I am am weighing my options for treatment. I have one teams opinion but will get another teams' on Tuesday. I'm sure that my imagination can't begin to prepare me psychologically for what is to come...so thank you for your perspective. FYI ladies all perspectives are welcome the closer I get to deciding the more angles I have to look at this from the better informed I will be. Pamela, thank you so much for taking the time to PM me with your story, inspiration and wisdom! I appreciate every word of it and you too have given me something to think about in the days to come. I have zanax to help me sleep but I hate the hungover feeling when I wake up. Does Ativan have the same effect? I want to keep my brain as clear as possible right now. Lastly ladies has anyone ever heard of having too much glandular tissue which keeps an MRI from getting a clear picture? When the radiologist told me that I am one of those people and that he could not really see my mass on the MRI but we know it is there and it is cancer from the sonogram and biopsy, I thought it was odd to say the least. He then proceded to deliver the good news that he found no new macroscopic spots on either breast and then spwewed of some of the same things the surgeon has said. Well, I don't think on my feet quickly. And as I did not expect to do anything but lay on the table and wait to hear from the surgeon for results, my bff/official question asker was not there. Now I have mulled the conversation over (thankfully I recorded most of it too) how can he be sure that my ilc doesn't have any friends when he can't eve see the elephant in the freaking room?",

And now I have bc! It really sucks! My 1st instinct was to cut them both off and not look back, surgeon insisted I am candidate for a lx so he sent me to see all of the doctors that I may be facing before I make my permanent decisions. I was leaning toward a single mx with reconstruction and a lift. But since the realization on how they could possibly be sure I don't have other spots? MsPharoah, thank you for your support and encouragement as well. I did call the surgeon who ordered the MRI afterwards, when he called me back he would not talk about it stating he hadn't seen the report yet. I just wanted to know how we can be sure there aren't other spots especially in my cleared breast. The lx/mx will test the cancer side but what about the other one? I know I should trust the doctors but how with so many questions that are unanswered. MinusTwo, thank you for sharing. I intend to read everthing I can and continue to talk you wonderful ladies who are so much futher in you're journey... Thank you all for you words! Hug and love Molinda",

But let me share with you some details of my past 2 weeks. If nothing else, you will laugh in disbelief so read when you are good and drugged up...lol. Sx day BS walks in and asks is everyone on speaking terms as I had walked out on DH on friday before sx. Answer was somewhat yes but comical to say the least as my bff held my hand and he sat pouting in a chair in the corner. (I SWEAR I HAVE 4 KIDS INSTEAD OF 3). SX went well per both BS & PS. Pain completely out of control (I usually have a very high tolerance...but not this time). That being said, I was on a phentinol epidural drip until thursday, valium every 8 hrs, Percocet every 4 horus, Norco every 4 hrs, torodal every 6 hrs, antibiotics, colace and ambien at night to sleep. Through pain got 3 hrs sleep, 1st night, 5 hrs, 2nd night and about 4 the restmof my time there. Both BS and one of my day Nurses were losing sleep trying to figure out how to get me to a consistant 5-6 level of pain. 5 days of hell, finally being sent home with a consistent level 7 which was a cakewalk compared to what levels I was actually feeling. Get home, get off med track and hit a level 12 because DH fell asleep and forgot a dose of my meds. Out of control wanting to run for the hills, my friend came to the house doubled up on meds and basically knocked me out and told DH to text her every time he gave me meds to hold him accountable to keeping me on track. Day 2 stayed at a 6-7 yay for small miracles. Day 3 daughter got me back on track getting me to a steady 3-5 pain level. Day 4 son missed a dose getting me off track yet again. He left in am with daughter to take her to work to which i woke up to nobody around me. DH in back bedroom with dead cell phone asleep unable to hear my cries, I finally crawled my way back throught hte hous to get his attention, needless to say completely out of control and off of the pain charts again. Also on Day 4 my grandfather had emergency heart sx and I was a wreck not being aloud to go see him, Day 5 told them if they did not take me to see him I would hitchhike if they didn't take me to see him. BFF did that evening and all was well as he was in ICU and we had to take turns being with him so I was able to sit a lot and rest. Then right before we left for the night, I had to go to the restroom, nephew wanted bff to help me to which I replied that I was capable of peeing on my own. Well apparently I was wrong I was able to pee but did not realize that I had to walk on water on which I slipped grabbed the sink with my right arm (side missing the 13 nodes) thought I pulled out right drain because of pain I could not stand up, writhing in pain, I yelled for help and was put in wheelchair, brought to the car knocked out again at home. Day 6, I got news that a very dear friend of ours dies from a heart attack 42 yrs old became very upset and began to have uncontrollable spasms to which my DH called Dr who did not respond quickly enough to his liking, called mynbff and then the EMT's. Dr. Called back, EMT's showed up followed by bff (what a fiasco to say the least) Dr said double dose my valium to get mynpain under control or my implants would have to be removed (like hell), EMT's said drains looked agitated but fine would take me in if wanted to go, Dr said save time & $ and concentrate on relaxing basically passed out and awoke calmer and more relaxed. My bff said she was now just saying everything is ok and I'm doing fine because everyone was starting to think she was making all of this crap up... every bit of it is the gods honest truth. I am just now able to look back at it all and see to huge comedy of errors that my life has become. Two awesome things have since happened...the red cross flew in my son whose in the Navy which was some of the best medicine I could have been given and my sister-in-law flew in to take care of me which she has done without a hitch keeping me at a 2-3 pain level and even helping me to cut back on some of the narcotics so I can actually enjoy my family and friends... Moral of the story...relax and stay ahead of the pain if you can and go with the flow. In the grand scheme of things, it will all work out in the end hopefully sooner than later. God is faithful and although he does not promise a trial free life/recovery, he does promise that he will be right there with us through them. Praying for healing and infection free as quickly and as miraculously as possible. Hugs and love to all! Melinda",

Quite frankly they matched pretty well, I bet no body realized it. I did kind of the same thing once and actually had nothing to attribute to since it happened pre dx. I wear scrubs at work have a set of black scubs with red stripes down sides as highlights. Also have plain black pair of bottoms and a pink top with black accent strips set. Well long story short, I wore the black pants with read stripe with the pink top with the black accents. Talk about being embarrassed! No body said a thing until I went to the grocery store after work.., lol Hugs, love and prayers! Melinda",
