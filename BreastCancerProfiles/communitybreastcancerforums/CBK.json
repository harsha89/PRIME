The hematologist said my WBC could bounce around for the rest of my life! He performed a bunch of other bloodwork as due diligence and all came back in normal ranges. He assured me prior to doing that bloodwork that he did NOT expect to find any abnormalities. It was reassuring though to have the tests done.

When I finally ripped that wig off about 7 months PFC, acquaintances were giving me kudos on my new cut! For months this went on... and i began to let go of my holding on; letting no one in about my cancer. I began to laugh and say ... so you really think I would have cut my hair like this? . these are chemo curls! The most amazing stories were shared out of that exchange.

I never had hair like this. Steph74- Yes, he gave me a lot of advice. He trimmed the back up and cut into it because it is much longer than the rest of my lid. He took off some dry ends in the front. Overall it was a trim. Well I guess I don't actually have enough to cut. Omg after a year this is all I have to show?? 1. Shampoo is very important. Don't shampoo very often. Like if you can help it once a week. Use a moisturizing shampoo that is not alkaline in nature. Shampoo with conditioner in between shampoos if need be. Use Color treated shampoos or those specific to curly hair are good. Stay away from drugstore brands. 2 Moisture, moisture, moisture. After shampooing and conditioning (leave ins are good) place an oil product on hair and a moisturizing curl creme. He said to stay away from mousse and gels. 3. Avoid blow drying and allow hair to mostly air dry. When hair is wet fresh out of shower, use an old T-shirt to scrunch the hair to get water out and define curls before placing on product. 4. When hair is almost fully air dried, you can diffuse or use a ceramic barreled round brush with boar brissels to create softer curls. I bought one that was super small like 1-1/2 inch barrel. It's like using a curling iron on hair. He didn't specify specific products to use but I will give you a few that I like so far. My hair although thick as hell, the individual strands are fine. I like Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo, Beautiful Curls activating leave-in conditioner, Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie, Beautiful Curls Activating Creme, Agidar Argan Oil, Ouidid heat and humidity gel (I know a gel but it's from a curl line and it's honestly the only product that I've tried in that line I like). I also use Beautiful Curls Reviving Tonic spray and Cantu Comback Curl revitalizor. Definitely deep condition once a week. I actually use organic black castor oil once a week for hair and scalp. It's messy but it leaves the hair and scalp so healthy and definitely relaxes the curl. I put it on for a few hours or overnite with a terry lined shower cap on. I'm always changing up what deep conditioner I use. He was completely against me straightening the curl because he just liked it-Haha glad someone does! But did say if I tired of the curl by summer he would do Keratin treatment on it and it would not damage my hair and the curl would return. Stay far away from other harsher straightening options. He felt that my curl was to stay 😱 I say no way.... I guess time is to tell! Is that more than you wanted to know? Be in touch!! K",

But I don\u2019t think there is any concrete research behind any of my method. I started 5000mcg Biotin while on taxol with b6 and b12. I washed my scalp first with baby shampoo and then with Avalon organic biotin thickening shampoo when I began to sprout. I used organic castor oil on my scalp at least 2 times a week (left it on overnite). I still use castor oil on my scalp, eyebrows, and eyelashes; organic black Jamaican castor oil. I used nioxin sparingly; once the follicle opened I didn\u2019t use it anymore. I waited to color my hair at about 6 months. I only use a mild product called Naturtint, love this product. After coloring my hair in a salon for decades, this color is so rich and mild; holds very nicely. Doesn\u2019t seem to dry or damage my emerging locks in the least! I think healthy eating shows up in our hair and nails. When I was having trouble eating during chemo I turned to smoothies as meal replacement. Vega one powder and Garden of Earth powder are packed with plant based protein and vitamins. Especially needed is vitamin C for healthy hair. High quality fish oil supplement is something to consider as well. Fairchild. Congrats to you finishing chemo. 🥳 I finished about a year ago, I started going wigless about July. But I was super self conscious. It was when I was ready. My hair grew In super curly and still is. Indeed it is an adjustment caring for chemo curls. Any tips or products you like? Moisture moisture moisture. Do you have a spray oil you like to use on dry hair? Im still frustrated a year later as my hair is only 6 or 7 inches. But it\u2019s thick and healthier than pre-chemo; now-it\u2019s just a wait game to grow. Grow, grow, grow Ladies. ❤️",

I\u2019m sorry to hear you had reaction to first infusion with Taxol, but it\u2019s not an uncommon experience; I didn\u2019t have one but a person next to me did once during my treatment. You know if you don\u2019t tolerate Taxol there are other chemo drugs that they would probably switch you to. Although it\u2019s very possible they are just going to revise your pre-meds and you will be just fine!! I lost all my hair on AC but had a wig picked out and ready to go. I didn\u2019t have a plan to \u201cshave-down\u201d! I cut it really short when it started to go but then just a few days later I went to wig store to shave down. Do you have a plan about what you want to do when you lose your hair? Like do you have a wig or scarves or head caps ready? That can be helpful to ease the pain and fear. And do you have a plan of where the shave down will occur? In other words if you start losing hair very quickly can you just easily have it shaved down without waiting for some far off appt? I don\u2019t know how you lose hair on your chemo regime. So I don\u2019t know how dramatic it is and how fast it comes out. I\u2019m sure some on this board can advise you better on that than me. I grew hair on Taxol but lost my lashes and brows!! It will be ok. One thing I never expected is when my hair grew back it was thicker and healthier than I ever imagined. My brother remarked \u201cwhat did they put fertilizer in that chemo?\u201d 😅 Hugs!! Keep reaching out!!",

That's when I joined the boards. Taxol was a long winding process for me and I received great support and information on the weekly taxol threads. I had mild side effects that my MOs office would say they never heard of and sure enough someone would be chatting about it on the boards. Gave me great comfort. I hear you, I have a human hair wig I barely wore. It was gorgeous but never felt quite right in it. Loved my synthetic hair bands I would wear with hats during the winter; kept me warm! I was always cold during chemo. Jaboo! Yup, that's about when the fuzz started for me. See you are on your way! So exciting!! I remember obsessing over my new threads! What shampoo to use, what to rub on my head etc..etc. it's so exciting to watch it grow! Keep us posted and you can always DM me too! I look forward to hearing good news from you!! ",

I would think it would be super odd for my hair to be that different from my original hair forever. Mudd I think you need to use a lot of product in curly hair. I mean if you got real curl... you can\u2019t fight it. I sometimes use steam rollers on mine to get looser curls...great because they don\u2019t damage the hair and you might like the volume it gives you. I use a lot and I mean a lot of natural oils on my hair and a good curl product. Do my castor oil treatments once a week and a another deep conditioning treatment. Only wash with a clarifying shampoo max once a week; otherwise cowash or just use conditioner to wash it. Can\u2019t wash real curly hair a lot. Never brush unless it\u2019s wet.

They are on a totally different growth cycle as head hair! Have you used anything on your lid to open hair follicle like nizorol shampoo? Someone on this board suggested to me and I hit my lid with it a couple of times and it seemed to work. I would use it sparingly though and continue to massage scalp with a gentle organic shampoo that might have some active ingredients to encourage growth. I liked Avalon organics Biotin thickening shampoo. But there are others! Usually the back of lid starts to grow in first and then front follows, here I was about 4 weeks out of chemo.

Having no eyelashes is super tough to apply falsies with, so I would just line my eyelid with liner and friends remarked they didn't notice they were missing. Maybe they were just being kind, I will have to ask them now that I have a full set of lashes too. I need help with something, I have asked this on boards before, but no one responded. My eyelashes have grown in like all wild..straight, sticking down, and i think some are irritating my eyes. I went ophthalmologist and he claim there is nothing wrong with my eyes or lashes but I am unable to wear my contacts. From an aesthetic standpoint just curling my lashes with an eyelash curler doesn't work either? Any suggestions? I think it is super common to lose eye lashes and brows post taxol regime, hang in there ladies...

Losing my hair was super traumatic for me some people deal with it with more grace than others. I lost every hair too on my body except 🥁 one wild grey eyebrow hair. One. I\u2019ve been playing around with every eye brow product under the sun. I never cared so much about my eyebrows until they left me. Mine also when they grew back in are lighter in areas that make them look nonexistent. Love my new products from benefit. This works great if you have growing in brows that need plumping. It\u2019s called the Brow dream team Set. Start with 24 hr brow setter gel. Then start filling in with precisely brow pencil and add a little more color with thicker pencil included in kit. Only $24.00. No I don\u2019t work for Benefit. Ha! Getting them waxed just helped define the shape better and with products they look super realistic and PLUMP. These products really cover the light hairs. Klvans- thanks for your words but this lid really wild. Wish I could could just understand why it\u2019s repelling color so much. I suppose it\u2019s all chemistry. Ingerp- not everyone loses lashes and brows on taxol. I hope you are one of the lucky. Mine fell out toward mid taxol infusions to the end.

I really liked the ingredients in it to stimulate growth. And it was very inexpensive !! Once I hit the 5 1/2 month mark I went to my hairstylist to color my hair but it was repelling color. Of course my virgin hair color was much darker than I remember and I was shooting for a copper red that came out like rust! I was so upset. I think a lot of the ladies on this topic have mentioned how chemo hair can repel color!! So my friend and I took matters into our own hands with Naturtints from Whole Foods. Love that product and nailed the color perfectly. Even my hairdresser said\u201d you put me outta business \u201c. I still use that color to this day. I used a lot of different products on my hair but I made sure I stayed away from sulfates, silicones, parabens and phthalates. When my hair was just sprouting I used a spray- in leave in conditioner. I also used castor oil regularly which everyone will gang up on me and say it has no research behind it that it sprouts hair, but I never have had this thick of hair since maybe when I was in my twenties. It\u2019s a monster. I continue to use it on my eyebrows and lid to this day. Good luck to you; grow, grow, grow!!!  ",

Honestly this varies from person to person so much but in general color changes and textures are super common. Like my hair was mostly straight with a slight wave and a light brown pre-chemo. Post chemo very dark with abundant curls. 16 months post chemo the curls are as strong as ever. Who knows. I say pick a shampoo that is sulfate-free, no parabens etc with good natural oils in it. I used Avalon Organics Biotin thickening shampoo. Not expensive but has some very nice ingredients in it ! I doubt there is one BEST shampoo. But just ones to stay away from. Just don\u2019t get into minoxidil! I used a light spray in conditioner too. I stayed away from as much chemical as possible. And massaged my lid periodically with oils! Good luck good to hear you are sprouting so quickly after chemo. I know how exciting this can be.... grow grow grow!!!",

So you get this awful pain and you begin to close off the whole front of the body, when actually you need to stretch and open it up.

Try to make sure you are going to a PT that has experience with women with mastectomies and reconstruction. This guy (PT) did, and he knew exactly what to do to relieve my problem. The expanders make your chest tight so that along with the BMX, can cause your to round and cause all sorts of problems with pain and such. But I bet if you get working on it, you will get some quick relief!! Insist you be referred to a qualified PT, it should be fully covered under your insurance through PS. Good luck!!",

I\u2019m pretty certain there are other things contributing to this. I have CIPN from taxol and had my ovaries removed while being perimenopausal. So my drop in estrogen could be much more extreme than the average person. My joint aches are pretty intense but finally improving. I have had severe dizziness (that has seem to subsided by moving my dosing of anastrozole from late afternoon to first thing am) sleeping and hot flashes have improved overnight with the shift in timing of dosing. I have tried a few things that have worked without a doubt for joint issues. Acupuncture which works for hot flashes as well. Of course my insurance doesn\u2019t cover this so it gets pricey but some plans do and it\u2019s well worth a try. Both my oncologist and psydiatrist are huge proponents of this. A strong yoga practice has literally saved my life through this transition. Probably the single biggest help to the side effects of anastrozole and CIPN. I take a lot of supplements the B vitamins with complex\u2019s, D3, calcium with magnesium and K2-plant based, high quality fish oil and turmeric. Things have gotten better on anastrozole and believe me there were days I could not do a thing. My oncologist and I decided to switch me to brand Arimidex to see if that may further help my issues. I\u2019m just waiting for medication to arrive from mail order pharmacy. Oh I start PT this week too. I\u2019m still undergoing breast reconstruction so there is a lot going on but honestly that doesn\u2019t seem to be a factor. All of this started once my ovaries were removed and I was placed on anastrozole. Oh i walk a lot with my dog, nothing more therapeutic than that! Movement movement movement. My Dr says critical to get 30 minutes aerobic activity per day. Research shows it lessens side effects. My Dr wanted to put me on cymbalta for CIPN that is probably exasperating this, well not probably is definitely, but I haven\u2019t done that yet. I have it in my treasure chest just waiting.

My Side effects include joint pain, hot flashes, insomnia, snapping in joints, dizziness, fatigue, headaches, and mood swings. Be ready to exercise daily and get a strength training program together. Mobility is a huge factor, and I was very in shape prior to surgery. Acupuncture definitely helped hot flashes! I was peri-menopausal prior to my ooph.

This animation disappeared!! Resistance training under guidance of my amazing PT with stretching 🙆♂️, electro stim, and his manual manipulations have made me a new person. Funny thing is some of my upper body issues were just from BMX and 16 infusions on one arm!! Omg. I have not had any massage therapy. Every woman that has had this surgery needs PT, I am blessed to have one that is knowledgeable in this specific rehab!! Much healing to you ladies!!",

My experience with the mastectomy was either sleep in a recliner or a bed that is very low to the ground. So you can roll yourself out of bed if you need to move. You literally need to use all the strength of your lower body to get up from a lying down position. Because you can\u2019t be using the muscles that you normally would to press yourself up from a sleeping position. This was the most frustrating thing about recovery. I would get stuck in bed and need to be pulled out. But my bed was super high .... not good for recovery. This didn\u2019t last long but STUCK in my mind, so I mention it if no one else has. Fritz is right you need pillows everywhere of different sizes. And you need one for the car drive home from hospital to place over your chest between seatbelt!! Good luck to you. I healed much quicker than I thought I thought I would, but it was a process.",

It\u2019s not a big deal to drain; I had mine drained multiple times in the PS office. Of course if you are needle shy, just don\u2019t look. But it doesn\u2019t hurt! If it\u2019s small and not causing problems you can let it reabsorb on its own. I wear sports bras most of the time. But really exciting now that I see those foobs over the last couple of days dropping. I have space between them now- wohoo! Only problem is my lat-flap hematoma side is still high,so I\u2019m lopsided again. I wonder will I ever be even. 😡. PT is going to help you tremendously. First thing my guy did was stretch stretch stretch. When I had my exchange surgery my PS loosened the lat muscle thread. I had too much animation on that foob. So that\u2019s always an option too, when you see where you are at. I wish you much luck with chemo. Honestly I thought it was going to be much much worse. If I could do over, I think I would have tried intermittent fasting. Here\u2019s to moving forward...one day at a time!\u2019 ",

My chemo was neo-adj but there was some argument that they should only use my one arm. My infusion nurse wrapped my infusion site tight post treatment and Iwas fine. Very personal decision but I was adamant NO PORT!! I wish you all strength and positive vibes through your treatments!",

I don\u2019t know anyone that gets away with keeping their hair on AC. My side effects weren\u2019t terrible on AC; as long as you keep ahead with the meds it\u2019s more the psychological toll I felt in my case. The first two were very easy for me then last 2 a little tougher! Make sure she doesn\u2019t get backed up, that\u2019s the worst thing that happened to me. If it\u2019s any consolation some people grow back hair more beautiful than ever. I hope this is your mothers case! Hang in there ! It will be ok.",
