I ws aloso give a book called \"Just Get Me Through This'.  It was written by a survivour and her doctor when she was first dx.  It's funny in parts and the descriptions of terms and tests wer very good.  I actually took the book to the oncologist with me and we would write in the book for me.  All the things you mentioned all very doable.  PLease keep in touch and know that I am thinking and praying for you. You are a strong woman-always remember that.",
