I'm a little late in joining as I am almost through with rads - BUT (and it's a BIG BUT), had to take a week off as I have radiation burns under my breast in in my armpit.  I am very large breasted (D to DD depending upon the bra), and about 2 weeks ago right under my breast it was sore and chaffed.  Called it out to the MD and he gave me some powder to put in sterile water and told me to put it on a sterile pad and let it soak for about 20 minutes, twice a day.  Didn't do anything except get my clothes wet!  Tried Benedryl gel (for drying it out), cortisone cream (neither works very well).  Finally just took wads of gauze and put it over the chaffed/raw area and it started to heal.  But now my underarm is so raw, red and inflammed that I can barely move my arm.  Have painkillers which help, but everytime I try to move my arm I get so much pain. (imagine a raw open blister under your armpit and you get the idea).  Also have intermittent sharp jabbing pains in my entire breast. I have two more all breast radiations and five targeted radiations.  I just wonder if I really need these.  I mean, just how much can the final few help?  I'm so tired of this, I'm so tired of always hurting, I'm so tired of everything!!!  I've used up just about all of my vacation time going to a from radiation every day.  I show up on time and they are late getting to me so instead of taking a 1/2 hour to 1 hour vacation EVERY day, I have to claim 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours instead.  Or, instead of working 9.5 hours a day I have to come in earlier and stay later to make up the time.  Very tiring. I know no one here can help me, just wanted to vent a little I guess.",

Well, it's been one week exactly since my first treatment and I have to say, I must be the weirdo.  I have had diarrhea every single day since treatment!  Also developed \"thrush\" (which may be why I have the diarrhea - all things are connected, aren't they?).  MD gave me Lomotil and Diflucan and they have helped.  My tongue is at least getting back to a normal color!  Now if my bowels would just cooperate! And like so many of you - I'm breaking out!  58 years old and I have pimples!  Not too bad, but still, how embarrassing!  I even have a pimple on my eyelid!  Ouch!  And as I've had very oily skin/hair all my life, I'm actually looking forward to drying out from the treatment.  I feel like an oil slick.  I did buy some witch hazel and Seabreeze to help keep my skin clean and prevent pore blockage though. Last Monday went for the Look Good, Feel Great makeup seminar.  As I am not a \"girly\" girl, having all this make up around is kind of overwhelming.  I'm just a blush and mascara kind of girl.  But I guess eventually I will need to use this stuff.  Some of the cosmetics are very nice and feel very luxurious on my skin, but I'm sure I won't use 3/4 of them.  Can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear right?  Saturday I go for my wig fitting and every day I look at my hair brush to see if it's starting to fall out.  Not yet!  Then I have to wonder if I'm having SE so different from everyone else, if my hair WILL fall out?  I sure would hate to invest in a wig and shave my head to find out IT DIDN'T fall out!  That would be horrible! Keep your chins up.  We'll get through this together!",

Finally caught up with all of your posts - whew - quite a lot of them since the last time I was here.  Welcome to our new members!  This is a great group with lots of encouragement and support. Bit the bullet yesterday and had my head shaved.  Found the cutest wig - so cute that if my hair does grow back normally I'm going to have it styled that way.  I'll try to post bald/wig pics later.  Also bought a very cute bucket hat with embroidery on it for those days I don't want to wear a wig.  Bought a 2nd wig from tlc, but it's too large so I have to exchange it.  My stylist said she will trim it for me when I get it.  Also going to look in my fabric scrap box for things to make into scarves (someone mentioned a pattern for scarves that I'm going to Google later).  My stylist told me that I have the beginning of some head sores, so every night I swab my head with witch hazel to clear out the pores and then wipe it off with a towel.  Feels real nice.  Took the advice of one of our members on the boards here and started taking acididophus (sp?) in huge quantites (3 million units/pill) and that seems to have FINALLY quieted my bowls.  Not perfect, but at least I'm not running to the bathroom every hour and I can get out of the house for extended periods of time.  My only other problem is a constant running VERY SORE nose.  Feel like I just want to stuff a tissue up my nose and leave it there!  OUCH!  I'm assuming this is because I have NO nose hairs anymore! Does anyone have any suggestions on what to wear under the wig?  I sweat so much it just runs into my eyes!  At this rate I'm going to have to clean my wig 2 or more times a week (NOT recommended).  My stylist said she doesn't like the nylon caps as it will make me hotter.  Need some good suggestions ladies! Well, I hope everyone has a wonderful Father's Day.  Going to cemetary later to visit with Dad and have a \"talk\" with him.  He's such a good listener! Deb",

Start chemo tomorrow 6/9:  TC: 4 doses 1 every 3 weeks (IV), wait 3 weeks for Radition (6-7 weeks, daily), then Femara or Arimidex. Hoping to feel not too bad afterwards, but have seen a lot of encouragement and possible solutions on this board.  I guess I'm going to have to start thinking about wigs/scarves, etc.  That's probably my most depressing thing - my hair.  It's long (mid-back) and straight as a board and the thought of trying to grow it back is so depressing.  But on the good side, maybe it will be curly instead of board straight when it grows back!  (turn the frown into a smile!) So happy to have found this board as I live alone and really have no one to share this experience with.  Family members, while saying that they are here for me, tend to disappear unless I contact them.  I'll post again tomorrow after treatment and let you know how it went. Thanks for reading!",

I go for simulation for rads on Wednesday and am hoping that they can do the rads while my boob is hanging down through a hole.  I have heard that this type of treatment allows them to more precisely aim for my breast tissue and keep it away from my heart/lungs.

Well, yesterday was my 3rd tx and went very well.  But again, waiting on SE to begin tomorrow.  BIG SIGH!  Trying to be proactive and taking my Diflucon prior to the diarrhea and the Flora Stor.  Maybe I can head them off.  The good news is that my white blood count went UP from last time (from 22.0 to 19.0).  Only ONE more tx to go!  August 11th.  Then the dreaded radiation treatments!  YUCH! My nails are getting funky though.  Looked at them the other day (I don't wear nail polish) and instead of nice white little half moons on the cuticle bed, I have a pink/rose half moon, then a white half moon, and another pink/rose half moon starting. I'm assuming the first one is from my first tx, the white part is when I'm healing and the second pink/rose half moon is from the 2nd tx. Guess I'm going to have to start wearing nail polish!  I'm so terrible at putting this stuff on.  All over my fingers.  I know I should go get a pedi/manicure, but with all the hospital bills coming in, I really can't afford any luxuries. And for anyone having Chemo breakouts, the absolutely BEST thing I have found is \"witch hazel\" (make sure it is witch hazel and NOT alcohol!).  Cleared my acne up quickly and I also use it on my almost completely bald head now twice a day.  Very cooling and soothing.  Even took care of the little sores on my head too. Another person (very early on in this thread) mentioned runny nose due to no hair!  ME TOO!  When I go to the bathroom at work, I have to wonder if the person sitting a stall down from me wonders if I'm doing so sort of illicit drug cause I'm always sniffling!  Ha, ha!

Going in for 2nd tx today and hardly slept last night.  Noticed yesterday that my eyebrows are thinning out, but not so much my hair.  I wonder if by swabbing with Witch Hazel that has helped (closes the pores).  The sore on my head are gone and the pimples are FINALLY clearing up (again thanks to Witch Hazel). But in case my SE are as bad as last time I got all my meds (lomotil, difucan, nausea meds [which I didn't need last time}, acidophillus and the dreaded steroids - wonder if I'll get pimples again - dang!)

Have my next appointment for 6/30 at 10:00 a.m. and I'm hoping it will go faster as I shouldn't have to wait for blood work and the Rx to send up the drugs.  But again, except for the after effects, a real NONE EVENT.  HOORAY!",

It's now the 4th day since my first Chemo and it's finally starting to hit me.  Must be the steroids wearing off.  All the old hurts are coming back (arthritis), nothing tastes good and I feel yucky.  Was supposed to go out to dinner with my brother and SIL but I called to cancel.  No sense wasting good money on food I can't taste!  Drinking lots of iced tea and liquids, tried several different things to eat and nothing tastes quite right.  Feel sort of \"off\", if you know what I mean.  Still have to go to the bathroom more than I would like to though.  And I'm starting to get a mouth sore (actually the tip of my tongue is sore, but I'm always worrying one of my back teeth with my tongue so that may be the actual cause). But I bit the bullet yesterday and made several appointments with the Life Enrichment Center at the hospital and signed up for Look Good, Feel Better, a FREE massage, healing touch (which sounds interesting) and a round of Reiki therapy. AND...I go for a wig fitting on Monday!  I won't get it that day but they will order it for me.  I guess I've got about another week till I start really losing my hair.  BIG SIGH.  Not sure if I want it all chopped off at that time, but I better bring a scarf just in case. MzCapricorn WELCOME!  This is a great group and supremely supportive.  Please keep us posted on your journey.  We are all here for each other. Boy, do I have a taste for ice cream!",

Well, I spoke too soon!  Was walking across the parking lot to my car last Thursday (7/2) and started feeling very \"wuzzy\" (wobbly and fuzzy).  By the time I got back home the diarhhea began.  All Saturday night and all day Sunday I felt horrible.  The Lomotil the MD gave me doesn't work at all (unless I take 3 pills instead of 1, and then just slow it down a little).  The only thing I have found that works pretty well is FloraStor (at $21.00 a box!).  Things have slowed down now, but it's not perfect. And...my hair is almost completely gone!    But the MD did say \"it will happen\" didn't he?  I hate for him to be right (about the hair, not my dx!) I have posted some pics on Photobucket if you care to look at me post Chemo, one with bald head and one with new wigs on (pictures are bad as I took them from my cell phone with no makeup, etc).: http://s875.photobucket.com/albums/ab316/brat352/chemo%20Deb/ It's times like these that I wish I had someone sleeping next to me.  Evey night my upper back gets so tender and achy I just want someone to rub it for me!  Seems to be running a low grade fever (97.7) so that probably explains why I feel like cr*p.  My blood work keeps getting worse, so hopefully by my 3rd tx, it won't be so low I can't have my tx (next to last tx!!!). White blood count 6/23 (1st tx) was 4.3 (averages should be between 4.5 and 10.5) White blood count 6/31 (2nd tx) was 22.0 (yikes!) Sure hope it doesnt' fall too much more!  Anyone know how to increase you white blood cell rate? Well, I hope you all have a wonderful weekend - stay happy, healthy and keep your spirits up! Deb",
