My RO prescribed something called Elocon which helped. The nurse gave me an antiseptic spray to clean the area before I applied the cream. I then covered the area with nonadhesive pads that she gave me which helped to keep the cream on and also to prevent it from getting on my t-shirt. That worked for a while but not completely. The nurse mixed up a compound of acquafor, lidocaine and silverdeen, which helped. I alternated the two different creams which was effective. After showering I'd gently pat the area dry before slathering on the creams. I hope you will get your rash taken care of soon.",

It was my choice. I had no clue what to do so today I went to another oncologist for a second opinion. She recommended twelve weeks of chemotherapy (I asked her why and she said that while the cancer stage was only 1, the grade was high at 3). I was pretty surprised and now I'm confused. I think that Cytoxan and Docetaxel are the drugs she mentioned. I don't think I will do it. It sounds like overkill. She did admit to being a proponent of an aggressive approach.
