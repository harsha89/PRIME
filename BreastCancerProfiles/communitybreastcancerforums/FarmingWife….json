My husband is convinced I don't have BC because my breasts are small.  Is there anything to that?  I have a 5 and 7 year old that keep me busy and we live on a farm and have cattle which keeps us even busier.  I guess I'm full of excuses as to why I haven't said anything much about my swollen nodes to my mom.  And I tend to bottle things up...thanks for letting me get it out here. Geekyknitter - you had a swollen node about my size?  Yes, we are looking to see if it is fluid or solid and go from there.  Was yours fluid then or solid benign?",

I have felt my breasts for lumps and the ONLY thing I feel that might be something is that there is kind of a \"harder\" part of my breast on the left side and it is not there on the right.  It is probably a lobe?  Just feels a little firmer on that side - upper outer quadrant.  And the nipple isn't quite round on that side...but that's probably normal, too.  Funny how we look at our breasts differently when something like this comes up.  And until just Monday I had completely ruled out BC...then I read that thing about dense breasts. I will be sure to post my results here when I get them.  As I have searched these boards, I've found several topics started by women and the final results are missing - maybe they are here somewhere, I'm not sure...but I'll be sure to post my results one way or the other to help anyone in the future that might read this thread.  In the meantime while waiting for my appt it is nice to have some place to complain. ",

      "Content": "FarmingWife wrote: I have been lurking here for a few days.  Finally decided to post. I have a couple of swollen nodes under my left arm - one of them popped up last summer, the other over the winter.  We did a mammo and chest x-ray last July, both were fine.  I'm only 37, so this was my first mammo and it was just a routine one.   Back then the one was very small - pea-sized - so it didn't even raise a flag on either mammo or chest x-ray.  I did find out that I have moderately dense breasts. To muddle things a bit, I've also had a low white blood cell count for a while (which is the reason why I had a chest x-ray too that day.)  Once in a while it is in normal limits (4 to 10), but most of the time it is in the 2's and 3's.  I went to a hematologist in November and he said he's not concerned unless it is less than 2.0.  He also didn't seem overly concerned about the node - actually I don't think he ever found the node I was talking about, but he did locate a pea-sized one under my other arm.  By then the one under my left arm was probably double pea-sized, but I didn't push him to locate it as I hate seeing the doctor (major white coat syndrome - my blood pressure was through the roof that day) and since the mammo had been fine, I really wasn't too concerned at that point about it...I was more concerned about the low WBC.  I saw my GYN, too, and all lady parts are okay. My mom is my family doctor and we've run all sorts of tests...lymes, ANA, HIV, anemia profiles, etc. and all are okay.  So last November I swore off all doctors (the cost of things these days!!!) and decided that I am worrying for nothing...everything has checked out fine...that's what all the tests say and doctors say. Over the last couple of months, the lymph node under my arm has been slowly growing and a buddy has joined him...he's right below him and sometimes the two feel like one BIG LONG node, but if you feel carefully, you can find the separation between them. I try not to feel too much under there as I don't want to make them any bigger than they already are.  I finally showed them to my mom on Monday and she thinks they feel approximately an inch long each, maybe 1/2 inch wide, rubberly, not attached and she wants me to do an ultrasound.  We set it up for March 10th - it was the first time the imaging place could get me in after work and it's been this long, waiting a couple more weeks can't hurt. I teach high school so it is hard to be away from work.  I guess I've just trying to put all this stuff on the back burner...which is why I waited so long to bring it up again. When I search for swollen lymph nodes, I find stuff about lymphoma (which I suppose it could be) or leukemia, and BC.  I had originally ruled out BC because of the perfectly fine mammo last July, but in the last couple of days I've read that dense breasts are hard for mammos to detect cancer?  How come I didn't know about this?  When searching I also find stuff about \"I just had this lymph node pop up - it's painful\" and that's not my situation at all.  Mine has never been painful and is slowly growing.  Is about an inch (2.5 cm or so) really big for an axillary lymph node?  Should I be more concerned than I am considering I have two?  My mammo was BIRADS 1 so should I or should I not be concerned about BC?

The lymph nodes are rather large (2 and 3 cm) but I am told they look benign.  I haven't seen the actual report yet, but the radiologist said that they looked perfectly normal to him, just big.  Didn't give me an exact reason why or why they are very slowing growing. Whew!  What a relief to hear that!  I guess that means that big nodes aren't always bad, thank goodness! Sarahjane, that's a good way to look at it...I think my nodes must be freaks, too. I am supposed to monitor them and if they enlarge rapidly, I'm supposed to go back, otherwise just keep an eye on them.   I was bracing for the worst and got the best.  I'm sure I'll sleep like a baby tonight after the last few restless nights. The support here is AMAZING!!!  Thank you all!!!",
