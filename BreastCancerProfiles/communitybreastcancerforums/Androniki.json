Yes, it was uncomfortable and very long (a total of 36 hours!!) but it worked really well. My hair has thinned but I still have most of it. One week after the end of treatment, I was able to visit the hairdresser for a gentle blow-dry, which was easily one of the happiest days in my life. Now, I am taking biotin to make sure the new hair comes out nice and strong, and hopefully fast. Any experiecne with biotin anyone?",
