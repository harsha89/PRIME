The waiting was the worst part.  My onco says that most of the cancers start years before & so having to wait a few weeks is not going to let the disease progress.  Good luck!",

My new MO says also that if I have too many SE's on Letrozole, I took it before & it was horrible, then I can go back to Tamoxifen or Anastrozole or try one of the others on the list or none at all. This is why I asked about it being part of the trial as Deanna suggested & MO said no, this trial was only looking at the efficacy of Ibrance at different dosages over a 28 day period. But I have noticed that different MO's have very different ideas about these things, so while our situations may seem similar you may have very different conversations with your insurance companies & MO's. If you are having problems getting Ibrance covered can you talk to your MO about getting in the Palestra trial?",

Cheryl, I've had BMX, so that's a pretty big area to avoid :), like I said, she did put them in my hands, but maybe I'll discuss this further with her.  I don't think I did much meditating the first time, I was quite nervous, but this time will be better. Thanks all for your input, I appreciate it, Cheers, Dee",

Part of me wonders if I had known back then about changing brands to alleviate SE's that I wouldn't have become stage IV. I went on a trial 3 1/2 years ago that used letrozole & because of my issue with it previously my MO put me on name brand Femera & it was life changing for me. Almost no SE's at all. I honestly can't remember what brands of tamoxifen I used but if one brand is causing you lots of problems, ask your pharmacy to try a different brand, I had to change a couple of times. Quite often it is the fillers that cause the problems not the drug itself. I hope that makes sense. good luck, cheers, dee",

Unfortunately I got to see first hand how my friend Susan was dying of colon cancer. She became increasingly in pain & eventually had to start taking heavy duty opiods to control the pain, this is when she gave up driving & this was one of the hardest things for her. She lived alone & became completely dependent on people for the first time as she knew she should not get behind the wheel even to go down to the drug or grocery store. About 3 months before she passed, she started to become more & more tired. She would get up in the morning & have a tiny breakfast & then head back to bed for a nap. Get up around 11am, do a couple of things, eat lunch & then a nap. Get up around 2, do a couple of things, dinner & then back to bed around 7pm. The hospice nurse told her this would be the way it would happen, that as the end was nearing she would get more & more tired. She started to have more break out pain & would have to take extra meds. About a month before she passed, her muscles gave out & she couldn't climb the stairs, even 2 small stairs from the carport into the house. Her sister locked herself out of the house one day & Susan was unable to get up from the dining room to unlock the kitchen door. She sat there for an hour before someone else came by. So all this to say, I think what happened in her case was her body just started to shut down. It was painful to watch the process, but she was very accepting that this was the way it was. At some points she was comforting us more than we were of her & I felt bad about that, but she understood that it's hard for those who love you to see you like this. sorry if this isn't what you were asking...

The obit was written by one of his children. George eventually became one of Oak Bay's characters. In the 1970's, he was an owner of the Blethering Place, along with his second wife, Janet. They also started the Old Blighty on Oak Bay Ave. They owned an antique store on the corner of Oak Bay and Foul Bay and they even had an auction, at which George was notable for having a parrot on his shoulder. One of his best stories was about being in his car with his new friend Chris in the seat beside him when it was suddenly surrounded by heavily-armed police officers. This was the beginning of the famous Rocancourt arrest scene of 2001. Some of George's favourite watering holes were the Oak Bay Beach Hotel, the Oak Bay Golf Club, and the Marina. Of late, George had to travel to and from these places on his senior's scooter, which he drove as recklessly - and sometimes as drunkenly - as he had driven his cars in earlier years. George was always an optimist about his future. Right up until the aftermath of his last surgery, he hoped that he could get into sufficiently good shape to charm another woman into supporting him, or perhaps invent something that would make him a billionaire or maybe even win the lottery! He never complained about his later lot in life, living cheerfully in a small apartment that was just barely on the right side of the Tweed Curtain. While George did not live well by some people's lights, it should be universally accepted that he did die well. In hospital, two days beforehand, he said he'd finished with the medical procedures he had been avidly seeking for the past few years; he said he was 'checking out'. He was completely calm and committed to the decision. The next day, we brought in some beer, toasted his life with him, drank with him, and helped him to make several thoughtful good-bye phone calls. He reminisced a bit and gave us a few unhelpful instructions. He died without pain the next evening, from a slow gastric bleed, with his wits about him and a light heart. Turns out, his timing was impeccable: the next day we found out that he had been racking up ominous bank and credit card debts. Clearly, those supplemental incomes were about to dry up. In earlier years, George would sometimes slip out of a town after he had accumulated local debts and after the relevant woman's purse had been snapped shut. But of late, he was in no condition to skip town. And women just don't see old men on scooters as the stuff of their dreams - they see them as impending burdens. Perhaps George felt cornered. Perhaps he thought that, under his present circumstances, dying was the only way out. Whatever the story, no one can deny that George made his final exit with and grace.",

It was a bunch of rubbish, she was a horrible person to work for. Once called all of us \"snot nosed children\" because we didn't dust the furniture showroom when the store housekeeper went on holidays for a week, we were all busy doing our own jobs! She hated her husband as well, said terrible things about him all the time. Funny things, obits. I'm not having one.",

Maybe your son is the same? I think men in general are fixers & they can't fix this & it frustrates them. For a while my DH was pissed off at me because he said that the plan was that he would die first & this isn't part of his plan. I've had a will for years & I've been on the donor list to donate my body to science for about 5 years, so I don't have to worry about that. Once things get a bit sketchy I'm going to close my bank accounts & everything else is in both our names. I've gotten rid of lots of things, sold lots of stuff, enough to pay for our trip across Canada this fall. It's been easy because I've had a goal. My best friend just died of colon cancer & she didn't do any of the things she talked about doing, so I'm trying to learn from that. We also got to talk about dying & all the icky \"gifts\" that cancer gives us! :) I don't have any advice for you, but I think it's a good subject to talk about here because our families don't want to talk about it. I'm putting this in my favourites as I'm interested in what advice others have to offer. cheers, dee",
