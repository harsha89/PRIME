I sent a note home to the parents this week and told the students as well.  I ensured them that I will be ok.  I am trying to think of all I'll need before and after the surgery...mainly clothing ,etc. Thank you for the advice on what I should wear, etc.  Thank you all, also, for sharing your experiences in recovery.  I haven't had much time to reply...but I have been reading :) .  Prayers to all with upcoming surgeries and prayers to all of you recovering.  Oh...we caved and bought an electric laz-y-boy recliner the other day :) Laurie",

I did have pain, but mine was complicated by a staph infection which just about took me out! It does get better. You are right...it did seem as though you were sliced in half and put back together. I am back to working out with a trainer and am feeling stronger each time. Best wishes to you and keep in touch. I will try to check in more often.... Tami...so sorry to hear of your infections...hope all is well!",
