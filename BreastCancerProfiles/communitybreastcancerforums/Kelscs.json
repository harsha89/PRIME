The surgeon said that it looked like a typical fibroadenoma, so that is comforting! I am not nervous or anxious anymore ... atleast not right now or yet.. perhaps I will be by next week though. My appointment is wednesday morning with him to discuss pathology report. Before I was sure ... or at least was leaning on that side, of it being something bad.. but now Im pretty sure its gonna be b9! :) Ill let you know after my appointment wednesday.  Thanks again you are just so so so kind and appreciated!",

I feel bad I never told anyone the outcome! I had an excisional biopsy and it came back benign! Yay.... But here I am back four years later scared I have pagets of the nipple. Very insanely itchy, dry, flaky, peely, and now tingly nipple and areola. I have tried numerous rx steroid n non steroid creams n gels, even antifungal creams and pills. Only getting worse and no improvement. Ultrasound normal. MRI showed areola thickening likely related to skin abnormality and inflammation, but considered normal. Had a punch biopsy today...so again I WAIT :/",

I'v had really sharp breast pain in the same spot 9 months ago, it lasted a few months and went away. I forgot all about it until a few months later that same pain came back in the same spot. It was like i was being stabbed with a knife each time the pain came, which the pain was completely random. Sometimes it last a few days or a week, it just comes and goes for the last four months now. Because of the pain I found a small lump at 4 oclock on my left breast. It is hard round  deep and immovable attatched to other tissue or chest wall. I was nervous becasue breast and ovarian are interlinked and they strongly run in my family.              The Dr. assured me it was likely a cyst, and since I had pain it was a good sign that it wasnt cancer. Also since im onl y 21, its even more unlikely. I scheduled an ultrasound, it showed a solid mass 7 x 6 x 8 mm. The radiologist said it was likely a fibroadenoma, it looked pretty good mostly round smooth with a couple irregularities. He said I should monitor it and come back in 6 months. However, considering my family history ( All diagnosed in 30s and 40s and one at 23 yrs old), my doctor said I should have a biopsy.        Today is my appointment with a surgeon, its just a consult, to talk about my ultrasound, and different biopsys. Im really nervous. I swear Ive read everything online about fibroadenomas, and breast cancer and the differences. My charachteristics are half and half. I know its rare to have pain with breast cancer, but my  grandmother from my mom's side ( not the side of the family with the strong history, she was diagnosed at 63), also is going through breast cancer. A few days ago she told me how hers started, and it was the same as how I described. First pain for months, then  none for months, then pain again and she found a lump. She waited a long time to go to the dr. when she did it was stage 4 breast cancer, its now spread to her bones, and she recently broke her hip.       Im just really scared, not only for me, but for my grandmother. I know im writing a book on here, I just really needed to vent, because I feel like im going a little crazzy in anticipation, and I really don't have anyone to talk to about all this.      Thank You for listening                      Log in to post a reply",

The surgeon did an exam, but he also couldnt find it just as the previous Dr.s couldnt until I put my finger on it. Its because its small and deep. We decided on excisional biopsy. Since at times it can be very painful, also to make sure they have a good sample to check it. My appointment is a week from today, the 15th. I'm really nervous. In one breath, I am like no no way thatd be impossible, and in the next im scared to death because of the family history. I guess only time and waitng will tell.           - Kelsey",
