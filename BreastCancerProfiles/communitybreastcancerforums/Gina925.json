The hair is coming back in and its about 2 inches...maybe. It looks a little thin in 2 spots but its growing. I am not comfortable going out in public with this teddy bear looking hair do & especially NOT to the office. It took it a lil time to start up again & grow, hope it picks up some speed. I don't want to have a dude hairdo! Thoughts?",

Ive been told that they want you to wait a few weeks before they start radiation to give theÂ chemo meds a chance to get out of your system. From a few that I know who have had it, they told me that its alot easier to deal with then chemo was plus your hair will start to grow back! YESSSSSSS! Gina",
