Actually now the lump seemed to go away. Two weeks ago I also had cording problem (axillary webbing syndrome). When I tried to stretch my arm, it really hurt. But now, that pain also has gone. I do stretch and message every day since I found the lump and it does help with the saroma and cording problem.",
