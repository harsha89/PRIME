My hair was long and straight with layers. I had to show my driver's license the other day at the eye doctor and it's a picture of me with my long, straight hair. Well, they just had to show it around to everyone that worked there - \"look how beautiful her hair was\" - translation: look how crappy it looks now! I felt like a freakshow. I am about 9 months PFC - I did give it one shot at trimming off the ringlets about 2 weeks ago, but they're right back. It did get rid of some frizzy parts, but I think I'm going back to my original plan - wait it out and hope the weight of a longer length pulls out the curl some. It makes me look so much older, and like a 1950's housewife. I hate that people think this is my idea of a hairstyle. Oh, well......it does like kind of cute with a headband. And earrings, and lots of eye makeup, and, and, and.... One thing I did notice that helps - after I wash and towel dry it, I put on one of my wig caps and let it dry while it's plastered to my head. THAT kills the spring for a while! But isn't it amazing how resilient it is? Plus, I thought I heard that after about 7-12 months your hair follicles return to normal. Anyone else ever hear that? ",

I had a lumpectomy, and my surgeon said he had to dig all the way to the chest wall to get a clear margin, so I don't think it was that large of a margin for me, either. My oncologist didn't say anything about it, though, nor did the radiologist. I agree with you, I assume the radiation would take care of anything that may have escaped beyond the narrow margin into the chest wall. I don't think I would want anyone to cut into the chest wall - I imagine that could potentially cause some discomfort forever. Actually, I would think that not only would the radiation get it, but wouldn't the chemotherapy as well? I'll be interested in hearing what your surgeon has to say. Please keep us posted. I hope someone who has had experience with this sees your post. ",

If my curls looked like that I wouldn't have snipped them off the other day! Yours are shiny and healthy-looking. Mine were frizzy and just looked like a bad 'fro. Underneath the frizzy curl it looked smooth and wavy, so, the other day I went to my hairdresser and had him trim off the frizzy tips. So far, so good. It looks smooth now, instead of frizzy, and now it's just wavy looking. There are a few spots where it's still really curly, but not frizzy. He said I may need one more trim, but I'm not going to do that unless they start getting frizzy again. So anyway, that's how mine is growing back. At least it's thick, but where it used to grow a walloping inch per month, now it's down to about 1/2 inch per month. I suppose it's all just a waiting game - all good things in time. When the hair follicles get over the shock of their lives, I imagine they'll just settle down back to what you were born with. My mother's did. Her hair was always thick and straight, she lost it with chemo (8 years ago), it came back curly initially, and now it's back to thick and straight.",

My Oncotype was 17, which right now puts me in the low range. But according to the TAILORx trials, the new intermediate is 11-25, so that puts you closer to the high side, and me in the middle.  I decided to use that as my gauge since it is important enough to them to have such a huge study underway. Unfortunately, being in the middle never helps with this decision, but I knew that my 17 score would not be considered low with the new rankings. Also, the KI-67 is what the oncologists used a lot before Oncotype, and a KI-67 of 50 is pretty high. Mine was 19, right on the border - again. Anything over 20 is considered high. Here's some information I found from the Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation about the KI-67 score: \"If your tumor is tested for Ki-67, your pathology report will show a Ki-67 score. High scores\u2014greater than 20%\u2014mean that the cancer cells are growing and dividing at a rapid pace. Higher-grade tumors typically have a higher Ki-67 score. However, there is no conclusive evidence that Ki-67 is associated with survival. Some studies have found that it is; others have found that it is not. Some studies have suggested that there are certain estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors with a high Ki-67 score that may not respond as well to tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. However, they do respond well to chemotherapy.  If you had an Oncotype DX test done on your tumor, Ki-67 is one of the 21 genes the test used to predict your breast cancer recurrence risk.\" I hope this helps some with your decision. FWIW, I did chemo and also had the TCx4 treatment. I'm certainly glad it's over, but I'm also glad I did it. It's sort of a one-shot deal.",

NatsFan - those are good tips, especially about the weights.  That's what I wanted to try - very slowly.  Also sounds like I should eat a bland diet and drink lots of water the day before I leave so I'm not \"salty\".",

I didn't mean the point of the TAILORx trials was solely to re-rank the scoring system. I just meant that was one of the things that will come out of it and that I personally based MY decision on the projected new rankings, where my score of 17 will probably not be considered low any more. According to my onc, they are still trying to decide what the scale should be and the boundary between low and intermediate is arbitrary at present. And yes, it was my Grade 3 that pushed me into the \"chemo is beneficial\" category.",

She didn't notice I was a Grade 3 until I asked her (I had been up for consideration in the TAILORx trial, so the reps were still in control). When she found out I was a Grade 3, she was quiet and contemplative for a minute while the trial people were talking, and then she just blurted out, \"I think you need chemo.\" So, I dropped out of consideration for the trial and the trial's head nurse in Atlanta said, \"For what it's worth, I think you made the right decision.\"",

Just tonight I saw a thread linking breast cancer and the thyroid, of course, but also thyroid and muscle pain and fatigue. Doesn't it figure - I can't get a doctor to help me with my thyroid for the last 20 years, 15 years ago I'm diagnosed with fibro & CFS and now bc. I've paid oodles to outside-the-box doctors and their ineffective treatments - just once I would like a mainstream doctor to connect the dots, and prescribe an accurate regimen of Iodoral and whatever else and monitor me! My onc has referred me to an endocrinologist she likes after I'm through with chemo, but if I get the same run-around, I'm going out of the mainstream again and insist someone coordinate the treatments and monitor them until I feel right again. Sheesh - these problems make you too tired to correct the problems! Expecially when you do it repeatedly and get nowhere.",

They started on my back, went around under my arm and onto my chest. I know it's the old revived chicken pox that reappears as shingles when you're immune system is compromised - I'm just leary of all these connections. I have also been diagnosed with adrenal fatigue a few years ago, just before chemo my onco found an adenoma on my left adrenal gland, and I do have fibro and CFS. What else? Oh right, 5 cysts were diagnosed on my thyroid gland about 5 years ago - went to endocrinologist, of course \"nothing to see here, folks\". They just can't get their noggins together and make a CONNECTION! Drives me nuts! I'm hoping my excellent onco can put the pieces together. Squidwitch - I've only recently upped my intake of Vitamin D on my own, because nobody has ever tested it. That's one thing I'm going to take care of when my chemo starts winding down in the next 2 weeks. I just want one person - nurse practitioner or whatever - to monitor all those things including estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid, vitamin levels, all of it in one place - then send it to my onco for review and recommendation. I can't run all over town any more and expect these guys to coordinate anything!",

I'm just praying it works! Right now they are itching a little bit which worries me a tad - hope they're not sprouting some new ones! As far as the pain, I'm in so much pain at the moment from my Neulasta shot that I finally had to take something for that, so the pain from the shingles are taking a back seat. It's hard to imagine that there will actually be a day when the chemo is over and I don't spend my days managing side effects!",
