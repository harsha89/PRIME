I had a lumpectomy on my right breast in 2015. Went through chemo and radiation. In 2016 I had a what my Oncologist called a local reoccurrence in the lymphnodes at my right clavicle (aka Supraclavicular lymph nodes) I went through chemo and radiation on my neck. I am set to co for my 3rd biopsy on April 10th this time it is my right breast again !!! My gut reaction in 2015 was to have a Bilateral Mastectomy and be done with it! My breast surgeon convinced me to do the breast conserving surgery! I\u2019m am considering no matter the biopsy results asking about Mastectomy... Has anyone had any experience with this? Do you regret the decision to have the Mastectomy? Did your insurance cover this option?

The MRI report states that the humerus scapula and clavicle bone show some infiltration that is consistent with metastasis. I went for a pet scan/ct which showed no uptake on or around that area. I am so confused !! My MO has ordered a bone scan just to verify! Has anyone had a negative pet scan yet something shows up on the MRI ? I am waiting for the bone scan to be scheduled. A little bit of history I went through my initial treatment for IDC in April 2015 only to have a reoccurrence in my supraclavicular lymph node's (just at the collarbone) in April 2016. I have since completed AC and I'm preparing for 12 weeks of taxol. Any insight would be great!!!!",

At the time I was still going every 3 weeks for my herceptin treatments. So I started over again with a new staging of 3c. In March of this year I noticed twinges of pain under my right rib cage. It comes and goes ...I went to my GP and they did an ultrasound done they were concerned that it was my gallbladder however no evidence of gallstones or any other abnormalities on the ultrasound. In May I noticed that pain was becoming more frequent. Most of the time it feels like a muscle spasm under my rib cage usually very sharp and intense. I've also been having pain and my back under my right shoulder blade. I have A PET scheduled for 24 August. Just wondered if anyone had similar symptoms prior to liver Mets diagnosis? I am optimistic and really hoping that it's just a gallbladder issue even though the ultrasound didn't look abnormal.",
