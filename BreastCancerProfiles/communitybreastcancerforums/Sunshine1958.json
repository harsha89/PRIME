Well, my bubble was burst yesterday when my surgeon called to tell me the final pathology report actually showed some microscopic cancer cells in one of the modes. So...next Thursday, Sept 3rd, I will go back to the hospital for a second time within two weeks to have all of the nodes removed and pray that none of them show any cancer!!! I have two questions: Has anyone ever had the same thing happen to them? Does anyone know what the \"usual\" recovery time is for a surgery such as this one?  I'm hoping it's only a few days, but I have no idea what to expect. THANKS for your help!

Here is my story \"synopsis\": June 19th:        Had regular annual mammogram. June 24th:        My doctor calls (while I'm on vacation no less) to tell me the mammogram                        showed \"abnormalities\" (don't you just hate that word?  LOL), that calcifications                        were showing up for the first time, and that I needed to have a diagnostic                        mammogram and ultrasound. July 7th:          Went for the 2nd mammogram and ultrasound, not in the least bit worried (silly                        me!!!).    Then the radiologist said the \"B\" word, telling me that he wanted me                        to have a biopsy.  And I knew that needing a biopsy meant that there were some                        concerns that it could possibly be cancer.  Left the hospital, went home, and                        dissolved into tears. July 8th:          Spoke with my doctor and she faxed me the 2-page radiologist report.  After                        reading it (over & over), I dissolved into tears once again.  The reason?                        It lists my BI-RAD score as 4-5, and by that point I had done a lot of research                        (thanks to the wonders of the Internet) and learned what each score represented.                        And for some reason, I expected it would be a 3 or (worst case) a 4.  But a 4-5??                        THAT is really concerning me!! July 13th:         Biopsy is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. July 16th:         I will find out what the pathology report says after it is sent to my                        doctor.  (Those 3 days inbetween are going to be the longest days of my life!) So that's my situation in a nutshell!  But tell me ladies...does anyone know of someone who had a similar scoring?  If you had received that score, would you have been more concerned than if you'd had a 4?  I know there is no point in worrying about something I have no control over, but I also know that all of you can relate to how hard it is to wait, knowing that the results could possibly change your life forever. Anyway, I would very much appreciate your good thoughts, prayers and support!   I'll let you know on Thursday, the 16th, how it turns out. Thanks for listening!

      "Content": "Sunshine1958 wrote: Hi everyone, After having an excisional biopsy on the 13th, I was diagnosed with both DCIS and LCIS.  I met with a surgeon and learned that I would need a lumpectomy and radiation.  He ordered an MRI, which I had on Monday night, and I just read the results of the MRI report which states: \"The 4 cm irregular mass in the right breast is at least focally positive for intraductal carcinoma.  The remainder of the extensive irregular mass is suspicious for DCIS.  Wide excision of the enhancing mass is recommended.  This may be assisted by bracket wire localization\". My main concern is the SIZE of the mass (4 cm).  Isn't this considered quite large for a mass?  Because the size and the recommendation to do a WIDE excision leaves me wondering if that will mean that quite a \"chunk\" gets taken out of my breast? The other concern is that I desparately don't want to have radiation!  I looked at the VNPI and at this point (with this size of a mass), I would at least equal a \"7\". Any information, encouragement, etc. would be greatly appreciated!  THANKS so much! Dx 7/16/2009, DCIS, <1cm, Stage II, Grade 2, 1/11 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I had my first FEC treatment two weeks ago, and my doctor told me to expect to lose my hair in two weeks.  Well, all of a sudden threads of hair kept coming out yesterday, and my hair already feels a lot thinner.  I know everyone is different, but can you give me any idea of how soon things will move along to the point I am bald?  I have already set up an appointment two days from now to have my head shaved and a wig fitted, but I'd rather hold off doing that for a few days if I can!
