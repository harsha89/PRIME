I'm thinking funny movies are out since part of her surgery is as I understand it going to pull abdominal muscle or tissue up into the chest area (I'm not very good with the specifics of the type of surgery,  I wish I lived closer so I could have gone on the appointments with her) I can't bear the thought of her trying to do that all by herself and unfortunately she doesn't have that many people she can rely on.  She has a couple of friends who they themselves are BC survivors so that is comforting for me to know maybe they can help her after I leave in a few weeks.  Hey besides online where can I buy some camisoles with the pockets in them (do they sell them anyplace like target or JC Penney or are they sold strictly at medical equipment stores).  The surgeon or nurse will teach me how to do the drain and keep track of the fluid level right?  I don't mind it at all, I'm actually going to go back to school for my nursing degree eventually. I again can't thank you all enough, this is such a warm, supportive and helpful forum -  I'm so glad I looked at this website!!!  ",

Thanks again for all of your support and kind words, my mom had her surgery yesterday and it went through perfectly.  She had the reconstruction the same day and the plastic surgeon was able to fill the space maintainers with 100CC's of fluid to start.  We brought her home from the hospital today and she's of course in a lot of pain but managing and moving around pretty good. They were going to do a tram flap for the recon. but decided not to a week before surgery.  I'll post this in the March surgery too but I wanted to give you all an update because you are all so sweet to have helped me out with my questions the last few weeks!  Thank you!",
