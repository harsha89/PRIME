( you will probably be even later than that if you have to have chemo I am afraid )   Although, you will see that some PS will fill before rads and some don't...they didn't with me at that would throw off my mapping. I am currently doing an IMRT Radiation its more targeted therapy I can send you some info on that for question re: your Radiation Onc.

I too worried if they had the \"right patient\" but I was relieved that they had my file EACH time on the table I was due and not to mention, there was my \"map\" on the wall...I was treated 3 different angles each day and then the last 10 were really close but less radiation to the area of \"suspicion\"  If the calculations are not set up JUST right the IMRT will not deliver radiation ...so its accuracy doesn't fall strictly on the tech. I spoke to my Rad. Onc. and he said the chances for my recurrences are now 1 % ( 1 out of 100 women/men )  he also said, chances of damage to the heart are VERY slim to none...however an \"overspray\" of a mm or so can be detected on the lugs during a CT scan.  Suggestion: no smoking ( I don't ) and healthy exercises.

Much LUV  Report Probes Safety of Plastic ChemicalBy MATTHEW PERRONE, AP Posted: 2008-04-15 19:49:47 Filed Under: Recalls WASHINGTON (April 15) - A chemical used to make baby bottles and other shatterproof plastic containers could be linked to a range of hormonal problems, a preliminary government report has found. The report was greeted by some environmental groups as confirmation of their concerns, while chemical makers latched on to the report's preliminary nature and its authors' warning against drawing overly worrisome conclusions. The federal National Toxicology Program said Tuesday that experiments on rats found precancerous tumors, urinary tract problems and early puberty when the animals were fed or injected with low doses of the plastics chemical bisphenol A. While such animal studies only provide \"limited evidence\" of bisphenol's developmental risks, the group's draft report stresses the possible effects on humans \"cannot be dismissed.\" The group is made up of scientists from the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration and the Institutes of Health. More than 90 percent of Americans are exposed to trace amounts of bisphenol, according to the CDC. The chemical leaches out of water bottles, the lining of cans and other items made with it. The American Chemistry Council, which represents manufacturers, said the report \"affirms that there are no serious or high level concerns for adverse effects of bisphenol on human reproduction and development.\" Among the manufacturers of bisphenol are Dow Chemical  Co. and BASF  Group. The group said it supports additional research to determine whether adverse effects seen in animals \"are of any significance to human health.\" Environmentalists, meanwhile, hailed the report as the first step toward reassessing a chemical they believe could contribute to cancer and other health problems. \"We're hoping this decision will force FDA to recognize the toxicity of this chemical and make manufacturers set a safety standard that's protective of the most vulnerable populations,\" said Dr. Anila Jacobs of the Environmental Working Group. The toxicology group's findings echo those of researchers assembled by the National Institutes of Health, who last August called for more research on bisphenol in humans. The FDA in November said there is \"no reason at this time to ban or otherwise restrict its use.\" The agency on Tuesday did not immediately have any comment about the new report. But growing concern about the chemical has pushed many consumers toward glass alternatives, and triggered investigations by state and federal lawmakers. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called on FDA Tuesday to reconsider the safety of bisphenol, saying the toxicology report's findings \"fly in the face of the FDA's determination.\" Dingell, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, issued letters to seven companies that make baby formulations earlier this year, questioning whether they use bisphenol in the lining of their cans and bottles. The companies included Hain Celestial Group, Nestle USA and Abbott Laboratories. A spokeswoman for the International Formula Council, which represents baby food makers, said Tuesday \"the overwhelming scientific evidence supports the safety\" of bisphenol, adding that no foreign governments have restricted or banned its use. The National Toxicology Program will take public comments on its initial report through May. A final version will be issued this summer. Earlier this month state lawmakers in New Jersey passed a bill that would ban the sale of all products containing bisphenol. Canada's health agency is also examining the health risks of bisphenol is expected to issue its findings in coming days. BRCA 1 & 2 neg. mx- 7 wks rads (35 rounds) LIVE LAUGH LUV...

Much LUV By Liz Szabo, USA TODAY Canada's proposed ban on a hormone-like chemical in baby bottles has spurred U.S. retailers and legislators to try to phase out use of the ingredient, called bisphenol A, or BPA. Canada's announcement Friday came just days after the National Toxicology Program, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found \"some concern\" that low levels of BPA cause changes in behavior and the brain, prostate gland, mammary gland and the age at which girls enter puberty. BPA-FREE:Blog keeps up-to-date list of baby products without the chemical Toys 'R' Us announced Monday that it will phase out bottles and other \"baby feeding products\" containing BPA by the end of the year. Wal-Mart last week said that it will stop selling baby bottles made with BPA by early next year. Nalgene, which makes plastic water bottles popular with hikers, and Playtex, which makes a variety of baby products, also say they'll stop using BPA, an ingredient in polycarbonate plastic. Brian Fallon, a spokesman for Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., says the senator plans to introduce legislation today to ban BPA from all baby bottles. The American Chemistry Council, an industry group, notes that BPA has been used safely for decades and is an important ingredient that makes plastics flexible and shatter-resistant. Rick Locker, an attorney for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association, says parents can be confident that products made with BPA are safe. Locker notes that the Food and Drug Administration has not found that BPA poses a risk to children. Neither have regulatory agencies in Japan or Europe, he says. \"Consumers shouldn't have choices made for them by rash actions by Canada or retailers,\" Locker says. But a growing number of consumers are concerned about the chemical, which has been found in the urine of 95% of Americans tested. A group of 38 scientists last year issued a joint statement warning that even very low doses of BPA - which acts like the hormone estrogen - cause profound effects on laboratory animals, particularly during pregnancy and infancy. They found that BPA can permanently rewire genetic programming before birth. The research was published in Reproductive Toxicology. BETTER LIFE: Find wellness tips and take the pulse of health news Stanford University pediatrician Alan Greene, author of Raising Baby Green, encourages parents to reduce their children's exposure to BPA. \"I wouldn't use it for my children,\" says Greene, a father of four. Greene says parents can avoid BPA by choosing glass bottles or shunning plastics labeled with a number 7 recycling code. Some bottles, such as BornFree, Medela and Adiri, are now marketed as BPA-free. Greene notes that BPA is found in a number of products, including the linings of formula cans. Because BPA may be less likely to leach into dry products, powdered formula could be a safer choice than liquid, he says.",

This finding resulted from animal studies, which \"show that exposure to high-dose levels of bisphenol A during pregnancy and/or lactation can reduce survival, birth weight and growth of offspring early in life, and delay the onset of puberty in males and females.\" While the dose levels tested on animals are higher than those found in people, much lower doses in animal studies also showed limited evidence for adverse health effects, including precancerous lesions, developmental and behavior changes and early onset of puberty in female rodents. The NTP report concludes that \"the possibility that bisphenol A may alter human development cannot be dismissed.\" North of the border, the Canadian government has provided a more definitive response. Late last week, the ministers of health and environment issued a statement that having completed a risk asssessment of BPA, Canada would take immediate action to ensure that \"families, Canadians and our environment are not exposed to a potentially harmful chemical.\" The Canadian government is now determining whether it will ban the importation, sale and advertising of polycarbonate baby bottles, which are made of BPA. For its part, the industry response has been meaningful: Both Nalgene, which produces the most popular reusable plastic water bottle in the U.S., and Playtex, which makes baby products, have announced they will stop using BPA. Wal-Mart has said it is putting an immediate halt to Canadian sales of polycarbonate baby bottles, sippy cups, pacifiers, food containers and water bottles. Toys \"R\" Us will stop selling PC baby bottles in Canada and the US early next year. In the U.S., Wal-Mart will stop selling PC baby bottles early next year.

ITS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH US thats why!...they were even wondering why! HELLO! So, it may not be what you are reading into.  You have a plan and you will get on the right path again! A breast cancer (BRCA) gene test is a blood test to check for specific changes (mutations) in genes that help control normal cell growth. Finding changes in these genes, called BRCA1 and BRCA2, can help determine your chance of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. A BRCA gene test does not test for cancer itself. This test is only done for people with a strong family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, and sometimes for those who already have one of these diseases. Genetic counseling before and after a BRCA test is very important to help you understand the benefits, risks, and possible outcomes of the test. A woman's risk of breast or ovarian cancer is higher if she has BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene changes. Breast cancer is extremely rare in men but BRCA2 gene changes have been linked to male breast cancer and possibly prostate cancer. The risk of some other cancers, including pancreatic and colon cancer, may also be higher.1 The gene changes can be inherited from either your mother's or father's side of the family. Certain people have a higher chance of inheriting BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene changes. Much LUV ~",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2008 09:59PM LUVmy2girlZ wrote: What is Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and how is it used? Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that utilizes computer-controlled x-ray accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant tumor or specific areas within the tumor. The radiation dose is designed to conform to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor by modulating-or controlling-the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding normal tissues. Treatment is carefully planned by using 3-D computed tomography (CT) images of the patient in conjunction with computerized dose calculations to determine the dose intensity pattern that will best conform to the tumor shape. Typically, combinations of several intensity-modulated fields coming from different beam directions produce a custom tailored radiation dose that maximizes tumor dose while also protecting adjacent normal tissues. Because the ratio of normal tissue dose to tumor dose is reduced to a minimum with the IMRT approach, higher and more effective radiation doses can safely be delivered to tumors with fewer side effects compared with conventional radiotherapy techniques. IMRT also has the potential to reduce treatment toxicity, even when doses are not increased. Currently, IMRT is being used to treat cancers of the prostate, head and neck, breast, thyroid and lung, as well as in gynecologic, liver and brain tumors and lymphomas and sarcomas. IMRT is also beneficial for treating pediatric malignancies. Radiation therapy, including IMRT, stops cancer cells from dividing and growing, thus slowing tumor growth. In many cases, radiation therapy is capable of killing cancer cells, thus shrinking or eliminating tumors.",

I recently felt a new lump near my old tumor site. The mammogram shows scarring over a surgery clip, so it feels like a tumor and looks like density on the X-ray. Should I insist on a needle biopsy? My oncologist doesn't think it's necessary, and my radiation oncologist has relocated, and I don't follow with the surgeon. What should I do? ANSWER: Of course we can't give personal medical advice, but we can support you with general guidance. Scar tissue commonly forms at the lumpectomy site, and tends to heap up around a clip or suture. Usually the scar tissue stabilizes within the first year after treatment. As the surrounding breast tissue heals and softens after treatment, the firm scar tissue may become more noticeable. But at seven years beyond your initial treatment, if you feel what you think is a new lump and the mammogram also shows a \"lump\"-then go to a surgeon who specializes in breast health. A biopsy can be done much more easily now relative to even a few years ago, and it may the fastest and surest way to resolve the uncertainty that you're struggling with. Good luck with this process. Trust your instincts! -Marisa Weiss, M.D.",

YES, that is my dog ...Minnie ( her ears suit her ...she's a very good listener and we pick up more cable channels now ! LOL ) My youngest daughter, bought her the pink attire for Christmas as she shivers when she goes on walks and then she threw on the tiara for a photo opp ! LOL  She is a Papillion and she is REAL sweet ! I am looking forward into the cruise...my other brother w/ family and Mom JUST decided on joining us....so now EVERYONE is going! A mini reunion...a last minute reunion I might add 17 going so far !!! I wish you all the best w/ the tamox. with little SE ! Tay, it is reasuring to hear that the skin starts to heal....I am so burnt and peeling and now I am getting the stabbing pains.  Everytime I pick up something ouch !  What is Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and how is it used? Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced mode of high-precision radiotherapy that utilizes computer-controlled x-ray accelerators to deliver precise radiation doses to a malignant tumor or specific areas within the tumor. The radiation dose is designed to conform to the three-dimensional (3-D) shape of the tumor by modulating-or controlling-the intensity of the radiation beam to focus a higher radiation dose to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding normal tissues. Treatment is carefully planned by using 3-D computed tomography (CT) images of the patient in conjunction with computerized dose calculations to determine the dose intensity pattern that will best conform to the tumor shape. Typically, combinations of several intensity-modulated fields coming from different beam directions produce a custom tailored radiation dose that maximizes tumor dose while also protecting adjacent normal tissues. Because the ratio of normal tissue dose to tumor dose is reduced to a minimum with the IMRT approach, higher and more effective radiation doses can safely be delivered to tumors with fewer side effects compared with conventional radiotherapy techniques. IMRT also has the potential to reduce treatment toxicity, even when doses are not increased. Currently, IMRT is being used to treat cancers of the prostate, head and neck, breast, thyroid and lung, as well as in gynecologic, liver and brain tumors and lymphomas and sarcomas. IMRT is also beneficial for treating pediatric malignancies. Radiation therapy, including IMRT, stops cancer cells from dividing and growing, thus slowing tumor growth. In many cases, radiation therapy is capable of killing cancer cells, thus shrinking or eliminating tumors. Anyway, radiation isn't what it used to be even if you didn't have the IMRT...I guess its just in certain areas.  Not all Rad.Onc. office's have it.  Its very expensive I think my total bill was $ 75,000 ++ and we pay 10 % Okay, I have talked long enough...time to get some rest ! Prayers to all the RAD girls ~~~",

Still fast walking EVERYDAY 2 miles...I NEVER have exercised...this has been good for my mind/body and soul ...I was actually by myself the first walk and I started to cry...I don't know why but I did...now my dd goes with me and its so nice cuz it feels like \"our\" time Okay, I too have to do laundry dishes etc... Much LUV to all you Feb-u-lous rad girls! Prayers ((HUGS))",

Another is my MRI...on my mx side...gosh just \"WHAT\" do I stick in!  I have nothing there! LOL...but seriously. Like Quinne said, It depends on your dx Hope you are all doing well...I have been doing GREAT for awhile...but I cried last night...a good case of the \"caceritis\" my hips hurt ( my mom has bad hips ) or my opp breast\"good side\" always hurting..and I question everything rather than saying...\"inherited or comes with age\"  I hate it...the constant worry...and it frustrates me that I can't just move far far away from all of it and NEVER think of it again!!!!!  I can't wait to start celebrating w/ NED...then I think it will ease my worries!

I did have x-rays of the hips and was told nothing showed up...so I left it as it is.still pain though.  I think it was once my back and fell in my hips. As far as the website my DH says the same...he doesn't get mad so much as \"again?\"...only you Dear Sisters can relate.  The pain in my \"breast\" is gone HOWEVER, I now have an ache from my arm pit all the way down to my wrist when I stretch.  The BS said, I must stretch.  Has anyone experienced this ?????????!!! My moms husband is not doing well at all.  He has lung cancer and just had a Cat Scan and was told it metastasized.  Not only did this bring all the emotions back it brought back my fear!  He was doing so well...though his cough just continued to get worse.  Anyway, we are in the process of having them move from CA to FL...I pray he can get SOME type of therapy.  Right now he is seeing a VA hospital and they sound like its a go home attitude and here is some chemo pills to take...he is going through major depression ( who wouldn't ) The Nurse Pract. told him to get his affairs in order...  Yet, he has no path reports or no stage...can they actually tell by just a Cat Scan ?! I cried all night...your right Sue its in our face wherever we go.  I just went to a little boys Lemonade stand and he had a little sign that read \" All proceeds go to BC \"  I didn't say a word accept \"What a great cause\" then my DH starts to talk to his mother and tells \"our story\" and she who I don't even KNOW...says yes I know about it...neighbors talk.  I guess news travels I felt just ....weird.   Anyway, our three sets of company JUST left and I am tired and in need of a vacation myself.  We did so much and I am worn out. I LOVE to hear how all of you are doing...its so nice to hear how we are slowly moving on yet check in w/ each other just like sisters whispering in ones ear or tapping on the shoulder asking \" Are you okay....am I okay ?\" Much LUV, Laurie",

      "Content": "May 16, 2008 08:09AM - edited May 16, 2008 08:54AM by LUVmy2girlZ Doe ~ Any preventative measures you can take re:TIA...like a blood thinner ???? Are you taking an aspirin a day too ? When is it that you get your port removed ?....Its good you had no complications thus far ! Indwelling tunnelled central venous catheters are widely used for venous access in patients who require intravenous nutrition, fluids, antibiotics, chemotherapy, and other drugs for protracted periods.1 2 Maintaining these central venous catheters warrants meticulous adherence to protocol, which includes adequately flushing after drug administration and leaving a heparin lock for preventing blockages, rigorous care of the catheter exit site on the skin, and, most important, strict observation of aseptic techniques when handling the external tubing so as to minimise the risk of infection, which is the main complication of long use intravenous catheters.3 4 The advent of completely implanted subcutaneous port systems5 has simplified long term venous access and also appears to have reduced significantly the risk of infection.1 6 Central venous placement of port linked catheters is similar to that of external catheters, but the venous catheter of a port system, instead of exiting through the skin, is attached to a reservoir within a port chamber that is implanted in a subcutaneous pocket. Port systems are accessed by insertion of a non-coring needle through a septum that constitutes the dome of the port chamber under the patient's skin, and can be used for the same purposes as an external catheter. The subcutaneously implanted port systems have become greatly favoured by patients, particularly children and teenagers, who are spared the discomfort and embarrassment of tubing and dressings on their chest surface and may carry on their everyday activities unhindered. Care of the port system requires flushing with saline after each use in order to clear the dead space of the reservoir from retained drugs, and leaving a \"heparin lock\" to prevent clotting and blockage of the system. The routine for intravenous delivery of the drugs must, as a rule, include flushing through the dead space of all intravenous cannulas at the time the drugs are given. Such action becomes especially important in the case of an implanted subcutaneous port venous catheter device, where dead space may range between 1.2 and 2.1 ml. Failure promptly to clear the drug from the port may result not only in faulty dosage but can have grave consequences when the retained drugs are later inadvertently flushed into the patient. Although a literature search failed to disclose similar reports, the danger of drugs left in a port system appears to be very real. Colleagues relate of their personal knowledge of near deaths associated with delayed flushing of drugs such as anesthetics, including muscle relaxants, after the patient had returned to the ward. Port systems are unsuitable for intravenous anesthetic and sedating drugs that are infused slowly so that the required dosage is judged by their effect, since there will always be a relative surplus of the medication left in the chamber, which can be only flushed into the patient. The only safe way to use a port device for anaesthetic drugs is to administer a predetermined dose to be completely flushed in, and treat any additional dose similarly. Directions given by \"use and maintenance\" booklets and training of staff must emphasise the importance of immediate clearance of drugs from the port system. Our experience emphasise the need for awareness of the possibility of drugs left in the dead space of a port system and illustrates the potential danger associated with neglect to clear the port chamber each time after drugs are given.",

Good for you on recommending an Oct. Rad thread!  It DOES help.  More than just rads as we know it... I missed the Oprah show...but my friend had told me ALL about it...perhaps I can pull it up online. YES, my Susan G.

I think the walk will be uplifting yet emotional at the same time...a roller coaster to bring out those feelings we try SO hard to bury...seems to crawl out from time to time. Count down Sue...how are you feeling these days ? Hope ALL is well...

The pain usually extends to the outside of the thigh area. In the early stages, the pain is usually described as sharp and intense. Later, it may feel more achy and spread out. Typically, the pain is worse at night, when lying on the affected hip, and when getting up from a chair after being seated for a while. It also may get worse with prolonged walking, stair climbing, or squatting. Hip bursitis can affect anyone, but is more common in women and middle-aged or elderly people. It is less common in younger people and in men. The following risk factors have been associated with the development of hip bursitis.",

Ulla~ yes it sounds like LE...Doe could probably give you some advice on that...do you have a sleeve ?   You can have mild LE I believe years after treatments I am afraid.   You shouldn't strain yourself.  Just be careful w/ the other strenuous activities you may be doing too much. Tay ~  You sound better every time I read your posts...your \"cleansing\" and exercises sound like they are doing you justice! SueDeg ~ Like I said, you should start a thread on \"raising teens support group\" LOL...those who SURVIVE the teen years !...I am serious mine is approaching and frankly we could all use the advice...or someone to relate as well. Mary Jo~ Yes, adorable baby!!!  How are feeling ?  I have the \"big square on my \"breast\" now.  I have to say, I went trying on clothes again and taking blouses on and off can be exhausting!!! I hope all is well with you all...saying a prayer for all ~ Much LUV, Laurie",

Okay, on to a more important topic...I heard that Tamoxifen can have an effect on your menstrual cycle by I believe 25 %...however you definitely should be seen if you have abnormal bleeding, irregular menstrual periods or pain.  Make certain you see your OBGYN for regular check ups too. Maybe your pain is due to an urinary track infection ? The good news is you haven't been on it for that long...so don't jump to conclusions okay.  I will say a special prayer for you tonight. CONGRATULATIONS on your awesome results mamo!!!  I cried too...then I got bawled out by my BS that I wasn't due for another 4 months In any event I am happy to hear the good news...keep us posted w/ more!!!

I told him I don't know if I am ready or not as I was coming to a close on my rads.  I just wasn't into it as my mind was already on another 'vacation' and my head just wasn't into it.  In the end, I was so glad we went.  It was something I wasn't aware that I truly needed and felt somewhat of my life getting back.  Sure I had those \"out of body experiences\"  Sandly Doe, it will never go away...I think it gets better and we become more confident each passing year, but sadly it never leaves our mind.  Like the elephant in our living room...we just have to be patient with it...learn to deal with it ...try to cover it but it will always be there.  Doe I am so happy to hear you are looking forward to therapy!  Perhaps you are looking for some kind of closure to this mess and a bit more organization w/in your life. It sucks...BC sucks..it spins out of control w/ loved ones/finances/careers/social life/sex life/house....yes I think every BC survivor has to survive the aftermath of it all...yet have our guard up. I think time will patch things up a bit...I am grateful for each day and I thank God for it..those beautiful days!  Sometimes I feel so alone ...even though I have family/friends and you my \"breast friends\" backing me up...I feel so alone. Then there are better days...I look back from where I was and it is strides by far.  I guess we could do that too. I read a newly diagnosed and can read the uncertainty in their thread and I think to myself I remember that \"waiting period\" the agony of it all. Remember how far we all have gotten. (((((HUGS))))) and prayers! Much LUV",

I find I have been so anxious for Oct .My scheduled MRI and couldn't wait for that day ...now that it is bearing closer my anxiety and fears and returning.  The fear of the unknown is scary...its like going into a dark room hearing a horrible sound and praying you come out safe. Its so easy to fall in a tail spin, but its so difficult to stay positive.  Those difficulties will make us happier in the end...a happier life we intended otherwise we would have never fought to begin with!  Life was never said to be easy. We must live our own life and be content with our own path. All we have is hope/faith/family and those are the most life treasures! Much LUV",

Keep on em Deg ! About your arm...I have the same feeling and I only had 3 nodes removed...I feel like its a rubber band that can snap any moment and I too get a stiff feeling in my hand almost like its falling asleep and shooting pains...I was out walking ( I AM FAST WALKING 2 MILES EVERYDAY!!! I never exercise...but I made it a promise to myself I have to do this for ME..it has helped so much.  I feel so good after I am done.) anyway, I had to stop once cause it literally felt like someone stabbed me in my 'breast'.  The Rad.Onc. said this was normal. I am experiencing pain on my opp side now and it hurts now and then in my armpit...now I worry all the time about if something is \"stirring up\" or not! Ulla ~ Wishing you the best...it sounds like you have to get on track, be good to yourself.  Doe ~ I hope you are both doing well...keep us updated on your progress. Sue ~  Hope you are doing well ?  Your new name Seashell49...tell us how you came up with it...I know you love seashells.

Looking at his patients the will to live and take charge of their lives even if they were never before and the surgeon is not away of being able to live as so much as part of team. How some patients unexpectedly die and how some patients unexpectedly lived!  I am only a few chapters in but it is one I want to give my stubborn surgeon..yes I admire his beautiful gifts but he too....has no emotions and like you said, I think that makes him the best...\"Just business\"  I highly recommend this book...its up your ally...a perspective you can identify with along with some faith.  A dear friend gave it to me and she kept saying, \"Read it just read it\" and her eyes began to fill up with tears.  My surgeon a total a$$ and yes NOT a \"people person\" what so ever Every time I see him I find myself preparing for a battle...but yet in that profession ....its obvious. The Greys Anatomy I missed \"Don't hug me\" ....I laugh cause this surgeon in the book thought his patients needed a \"hug\" but now he realizes he reaches out to them...for him. Anyway, your right..the tears come from no where sometimes, then I have to regroup so my dh or girls don't see me and worry ...they know I have my good/bad days ..I am entitled to such but at the same time its a personal feeling you keep sometimes...my own and I don't want to share as the guilt will be the aftermath.

Your pituitary glad came back positive ?  Then this may be all its linked to:Galactorrhea.The nipple discharge associated with galactorrhea is usually white or clear, but it could be yellow or green, and it may leak from one or both breasts. Galactorrhea occurs because your body is making too much prolactin - the hormone your brain produces to stimulate milk production after you have a baby. This also might happen if you have a hormonal imbalance, such as from taking birth control pills; an underactive thyroid gland; a tumor (prolactinoma) or other disorder of the pituitary gland; or chronic breast stimulation, such as from frequent breast self-exams or sexual activity. In the meantime...still seek physicians advice to rule things out! Keep us posted and a positive attitude ! Much LUV",

To re-cap I had DCIS/MASTECTOMY/RADS I have read before those that have mx are no longer screened ???  If they are is it more for the \"healthy breast\" yet, I have read those get screened the \"healthy breast\" just gets another \"peek\" at....I am so so confused I am ready to go to another BS Thanks for your help in advance!!!

Yes, I had a mastectomy and yes, they did take the nipple. Ovarian Cancer is so hard to detect and when one has symptoms its gen. already aggressive. I am sorry Gabi you are enduring all of this...yet w/ the BRCA testing its amazing they can identify this gene mutation and hopefully some day have something to correct it...but for now its \"preventative\" measures we must take! All my BEST with your decisions take your time do your research. Much LUV",
