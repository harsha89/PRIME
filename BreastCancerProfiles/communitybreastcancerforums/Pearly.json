She has had a mastectomy and will be starting her chemo soon.  My Mother-in-Law also had cancer & it was devastating to watch her go through the chemo cycles and see her detiriorating everyday...... And now I'm really scared for my mother. She is in another country & I dont have a very clear picture of what is happening or how bad the cancer is.  Can someone please educate me a little on what I should expect in the coming months.  Log in to post a reply",
