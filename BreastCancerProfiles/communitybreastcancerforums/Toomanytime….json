I had hodgkins in 1976 at 15 - treated w MOPP & full mantle radiation.  Had early menopause at 40 & then goiter & hypothyroidism at 50. Dx w hodgkins again, stage 4, sept 2011. At that time also had developed rapid pulse & high blood pressure. Fortunately after very difficult course completely responded to CT & given good prognosis. Have been doing regular mammograms since 40 but missed 2012 with CT & all other scans. Suspicious mammo 2013 lead to MRI, Biopsy & DX 11/18/13 of 5.4cm DCIS right breast.  Wanted BX but had to fight for surgeon capable of DIEP reconstruction. Finally had surgery 3/3/13 - 16 hours but successful!  Unfortunately pathology now also shows 1.4cm IDC within DCIS, stage 1, grade3, nodes neg, clear margins but ER-PR-, HER2+.   Meeting w onc tomorrow to see what if any treatment available. Additional CT will most likely lead to leukemia for me & herceptin may not be good due to existing heart issues. I have a great team but would welcome your input and experiences. My family & I have really had enough of all this but as I keep reminding myself, the alternative is not very good. Thx. ",
