My surgeon will be Dr.Look Hong but I'm still waiting for a surgery date as at the time they provided me with diagnosis they said they saw 4mm calcification on my left breast so I had to have another biopsy and I guess they're waiting for the results. How long did you have to wait for your surgery and how did you find Dr look hong? They asked me also if I have bone pain..I didn't at the time but now I'm finding that I'm having aches in my lower legs and am worried about bone mets through the bloodstream since at tgis time they didn't see any invasion of lymph nodes. Btw. How are you doing now",
