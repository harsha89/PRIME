I just had a bil. mastectomy, because my cancer came back after 5 1/2 years. Like you said...not surprised, but dissapointed...I think I knew it was back before I got the results...I was just hoping it wasn't. I was for sure after 5 years it wouldn't come back. Now I am waiting for all my wounds to heal so I can start chemo again. It made me wonder what I did wrong,but I guess there is no right or wrong. You will be in my prayers, we will fight this again and we will make it together. I asked god to let me stay here on this earth until my baby graduates from high school, so I need to make it at least 9 more years and while I'm at it, lets fight for a few more so I can dance at his wedding.",
