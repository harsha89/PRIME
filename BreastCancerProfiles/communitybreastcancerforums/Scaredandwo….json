I'm 43 with two kids and although have not been diagnosed with the dreaded c word but just got diagnosed last month with atypical cells and now fall in the high risk category. You have come to the right place. All the ladies here are wonderful and I'm sure will have many words of wisdom and hope and encouragement for you. Please be gentle to yourself and don't borrow trouble. Lots of hugs to you",

I had been wondering since then if I should have someone re read my slides hoping that they'll tell me there's no ALH and that the first report was not correct. I know wishful thinking but your story gives me so much hope! Wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience. It's interesting that they still had your slides after all these years....I thought I was already late for a re read after a couple of months",

I also forgot to mention that my nipple on the same breast seems like it's retracting from one side when I let my breast hang forward (when I bend down). Reading through some of the retracted nipples mentioned in other posts, I'm more and more convinced that this is not good at all. Really scared beyond words now!! I don't have my appointment till after I get back from my two week vacation that starts this coming sunday, which means I have to live with the anxiety till then. I feel like all symptoms are pointing to not good outcome which was the reason I pushed my appointment to after my trip :(",
