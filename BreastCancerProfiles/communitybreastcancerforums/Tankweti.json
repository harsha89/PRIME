My original onc only wanted me to do radiation + Tamoxifen with no Herceptin. I concluded the man was either nuts or trying to make work for himself when I came back with metastases. All my other docs asked me why he didnt want to Rx Herceptin and my response has been - \"I don't know. You would have to ask him about his rationale. \" Went for a 2nd opinion to Sloan Kettering. I had done my homework and knew exactly what I wamted: Taxol + Herceptin. It was not known if Herceptin worked without chemo and since I was node negative and PET negative, I opted for the least offensive regimen.as I live alone and have no support system. I had also fallen on ice and broken my right wrist just before treatment. The MD at Sloan agreed that I could go with weekly therapies of Taxol + Herceptin x 12 weeks, followed by Herceptin alone for one year. Taking weekly chemo is much less stressful than taking dose dense treatments every 2-3 weeks. Dose dense is what most patients receive. It essentially means you are getting a double or triple dose every two to three weeks. Weekly dosing takes very little out of you. While it is true that the dose is cumulative, and at the end you may feel a little under the weather, it is certainly a lot more do able than dose dense. I used cold caps and did not lose my hair although it did thin minimally under the influence of a year's worth of Herceptin. I am now going on 3 years post diagnosis and no evidence of disease.",
