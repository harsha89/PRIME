It may be too early for you to try disabiltiy if you're not someone who enjoys being home. You can always go that route, but it's harder to get back into a work situation once you've quit.",

      "Content": "Jul 9, 2018 02:41PM - edited Jul 9, 2018 02:43PM by sandilee I had a liver biopsy a few months ago. I was nervous because the hospital where I had it done usually doesn't use any sedation for these biopsies. I told the nurse on the phone setting it up that I wanted light sedation, and she said that the procedure isn't done with sedation. period. When I arrived at the hospital, I asked the nurse taking care of the pre-op procedures about sedation and said that I wanted it. This nurse told me to be sure to tell the doctor. So as soon as he came in when I was on the table in the procedure room, I told him that I was very nervous and wanted some sedation. He said sure, and instructed the nurse to give me what I believe was fentanyl and Versed. He didn't bat an eye at the request. They already had me on IV, so it wasn't a big deal. I have no idea why the administrating nurses at my hospital make it hard to get pain relief if you want it for a biopsy, or why that is the policy. I am relating my story so that you or anyone else looking for info won't be deterred from requesting, and insisting, that you get the sedation if you want it. I was still awake and could hold my breath when asked and followed all directions, but I didn't have any discomfort because of the meds. I had to lie still for four hours after the procedure, but just had a bandage over the area and felt just fine afterwards.",

He told me he didn't need to see me for three months, and that I didn't really need any scans until Fall.  This sounded good to me, but I do have concerns.  I asked, what about a CT for my soft tissue? My last CT was in December, and soft tissue was clear. At this point, I only have bone mets, but of course I'm waiting for the other shoe to drop.  My onc said that while my bone mets are stable, it's very uncommon for the cancer to progress to the soft tissue. If my bone mets were \"on the move,\" he would do a CT to see what's going on before changing treatment, but didn't think I needed  one because the bones are quiet.    Is this your experience, mets sisters?    Is it really uncommon for one to find that the cancer is spreading to the soft tissue while the bones are stable?    Or should I strongly request a CT in the summer or fall, just to be sure.  P.S.  I wish the site would let us edit our headings!   :-/    I tried.",

I try to make smoothies with calorie dense extras like ice cream and bananas along with the healthy vegetables. Load up on butter on bread and olive oil on salads. Omelets with cheese and sautéed mushrooms, baked potatoes with butter and loads of sour cream, whole milk instead of the usual low fat, etc. It's not a diet I would normally subscribe to, but if gaining some weight is a priority, serving the foods she enjoys and adding extra fat calories to it may help. Verzenio is very interesting and some of the women on the site are in trials with some success. I would like to try it, but the $6000 a month price tag is a bit prohibitive. I am concerned that my insurance company won't cover it. Medicare does not. It may take more time before it is considered standard care and covered.",

I'd be very interested to hear if anyone has had stable bone mets while the cancer popped up elsewhere.",

Did anyone else have a hard time watching the young female doctor deliver the news to her patients that, 'This disease will likely take your life?\" I thought that was pretty rough for the middle-aged woman who just learned she had stage IV cancer.

The program certainly gave me a perspective on how far we have come, and how much more fortunate we are to live in these times rather than the past. ",

They were probably there for at least a year or two before they were found, as they were so extensive. Faslodex kept everything stable for 3 1/2 years. I now have liver mets as well, but bones have been stable. Doxil seems to be reducing the tumors in my liver, fortunately. I feel like I'll be around a few more years, anyway. This is only my second chemo. Tumors reduced on Xeloda, also, but doc took me off of it to try a hormonal for awhile because of the side effects. Hormonals seem to have stopped working. So now I'm on Doxil. Only had three treatments, but it seems to be working if my CEA is any indication, and it has been pretty reliable in the past. I am hopeful, as there are quite a few treatments I haven't tried yet, and so far my mets seem to respond to chemo. I don't know if my liver mets are still ER+ as I haven't had a biopsy yet. Still may, but as long as I'm on a treatment that works, I'm ok with it.",

It went away once the treatments started working. Try not to read too much into statistics you might find on the internet, as the information is old and not very relevant any longer. It will freak you out, unnecessarily.  Most of us on the board have living with late stage MBC for years-some of us for many years.     This June I will be three years out with mets (7 years from original BC) and I'm feeling very well. My last MRI showed stable disease with the anti-hormonal drug Faslodex.  There are some new treatments available now that weren't here your first time around, and many are fairly easy to do with relatively few side effects.  With your hormonal positive cancer, you may have many promising options available.   I wish you all the best, and please continue to come here, as we all learn from one another. {{{hugs}}}    ",

I have very minimal side effects. Just a little fatigue after my Faslodex injections, but no joint pain or other anti-hormonal related pain. It is a very easy treatment for many of us, and I much prefer it to the Aromasin I was taking in the years prior to my recurrence. I honestly am dreading the day I the drug fails and have to switch, as I don't think there is an easier drug out there that has the effectiveness of this one. As far as Xgeva goes, I think it's also a great medicine, but needs to be carefully monitored, not just for ONJ, but also for calcium levels and bone brittleness. I've had no problems whatsoever in over three years, but my onc took my dosage down from monthly, which I did for two years, to quarterly, which I'm doing now. I also have to have my calcium checked every time I get the shot because the drug can lower your calcium in your blood to a dangerous level, but that is rare. So they check it just to make sure. Many women on the site have their dosage lowered after the first two years, as the drug reportedly stays in your system for a long time, and apparently does it's best work in the beginning, when the bone strengthening is most evident. It sounds to me like your friend's doctor is suggesting a very current and promising treatment . If Faslodex works for your friend, it may work for a long time. When I started this protocol in 2011, I had a fractured vertebra from the cancer and couldn't walk without support. Within a couple of months I regained my mobility and strength, and have been stable since. (knock on wood.) I think the combination, for me, has been nothing short of a miracle.",

University hospitals are another option.  Second opinions are standard procedure.  You really haven't even started treatment yet, have you? My oncologist has said that I should never be hesitant to get a second opinion in any specialty.      Keep trying.  I do agree that all tests and films that you have should be brought to the second doctor so they have all the pertinent information.   But you will find doctors who will be willing to do this. If you're really at a loss, ask your insurance company for some suggestions.   Also, why is your current onc switching your treatment from Faslodex to Tamoxifen? Are you post or pre-menopausal?   If you are post-menopausal, I'd really question that decision.  That alone would make me want a second opinion.",

So far, no progression to soft tissue, although I'm due for an MRI this month, so I'm a bit nervous.  I feel very lucky that his drug has worked so well for me.   I still feel very well, considering, and no one would know I have Stage IV cancer.  I don't need any pain meds, and only have occasional pain in my back if I overdo.  Like you, I hope to stay on hormonal medication as long as possible, but there's no way to know how long that will be.  I am getting scanned every six months, which means I sort of live in six-month intervals of mental peace. I'm not sure what my next treatment will be after Faslodex fails, but my onc has talked about Tamoxifen (I've never been on it), so it seems like he plans to keep me on hormonals as long as I don't get soft tissue involvement.    I  hope to live years more.  I'm 63, and I've told myself that I have to make it to at least 70, I have to see my daughter get married and my son have his children.  I'm determined, and I believe it's possible.",

That's why many women have chemotherapy.  Even after chemo, you aren't necessarily cured.  You can be NED, though.  As an intial Stage 1 node negative mastectomy with clear margins patient in 2008, my onc had the good sense not to tell me I was cured after my intial treatment and no evidence of disease. Good thing, or I would have been even more shocked when I found out I had mets this summer.  :( We need a cure for this damn disease, not more doctors telling us that we already have one, \"since it was caught early.\"    It sets up new early stage patients to be far too complacent.",

It can help with getting rid of some of the cancer, and really helps with the pain. She should also be on some kind of chemo or hormonal drug, and I assume she is. ?? It takes time for them to work. Hang in there, as I'm sure your presense is vital to your mom.  Good luck to your mom!     Edit:    I see after posting that your mom has already had AIs and chemo, and is still progressing. This is especially hard.  I do think the radiation is great for bone mets, and there still are several chemos she hasn't tried. I would not give up hope that they can get her mets under control.  {{{hugs}}}",

I was glad my onc referred me to a general surgeon for my skin biopsy.  He did ask where my onc wanted it sent, but when I looked confused, he stepped up and said he'd send it to the hospital Lab and they could do the pathology.  At least you won't have to go back to her again- or will you?  What a lousy experience!",

It may not be necessary if you have no pain and if the lesion is small. But if it's just one, it is possible that they can radiate it (kill it) it, and you may not progress. Your oncologist should be discussing all of this with you. At the very least they will put you on some kind of medication to stop progression. I had radiation and was on Faslodex and Xgeva for 3 1/2 years, which kept my rather profuse bone mets stable. Faslodex was my miracle drug, but I am ER+. ",

Much of oncology is an art.  Docs prescribe based not only on protocols, but also based on what has worked in their practices in the past.  My onc has 30 years of experience that he draws on when choosing my next treatment. While I like to research and get other opinions if I have doubts, I have chosen to go with his expertise at this time.  If I ever get to the point where I don't trust his decsions, I'll go to someone else.    If your mom's docs are happy to let her stay on the homonals, it doesn't sound like there's a problem. Her docs are giving her choices, so it sounds like they are listening to her as well as giving her information to think about. It all sounds good to me.  They probably wanted to mention the chemotherapy because it is another way to go that might also get good results.  There really isn't one right path while navigating this disease.  With luck, your mom will try the Faslodex and get many good months out of it (as I have) but it's nice to know that when it fails there is the option of chemotherapy- and many of those meds as well.    Your so sweet to be taking care of your mom. Good luck to you both!    ",

It bothers me that your oncologist feels that Faslodex works the same way as Femara. Faslodex is not an aromatase inhibitor, and the fact that he doesn't know that is telling. It is very common for patients to be given Faslodex after cancer has returned following an AI. Some might even consider that choice \"standard of care.\" Just check out the Faslodex thread, and you'll see a lot of success stories of women with that line of treatment. Do you live near a university, a cancer center or even just a group of doctors where one specializes in breast cancer? I know it's hard to go looking for a new doctor when you've been with one for a few years, but I really think you would benefit from a second, expert opinion regarding your next step. There have to be more good breast cancer oncologists besides the one that isn't able to meet with you. I really feel for you. ",

The reason I'm interested is that my onc has asked for permission to use some of my tumor tissue to test for a specific gene marker, in order to see if a new targeted therapy he has in mind, currently in trial status, might be something I should try. My question is, should I give up some of my stored tumor tissue to test for just one genetic marker which is probably only present in about 25% of patients or should I go ahead and pay for the test for the 300+ markers that have been identified as possible cancer promoters, which includes the gene marker that my onc wants to test for. That way I would have much more information, which would possibly give me more options down the line. It would be an expense to do Foundation One, while testing for the one specific gene variation would not cost me, as it's part of a trial. I only have limited tissue without a new biopsy, and I have already participated in Genomic's study, which requirred some of my tissue, conducted in order to create a data bank for an accurate blood test that would be able to tell a patient if his tumor has progressed, cutting out a lot of scanning. I felt this was a good cause, but now I'm getting a little protective of my tumor tissue. ;) I'm also doing ok on Xeloda that I just started, so I'm not really eager to get into a trial right now- although it might make sense if I actually have the genetic marker that would qualify me for the drug. I'm interested if anyone who has done this kind of overall genetic testing has had any success using the results. Thank you, Diana and Maureen for your thoughts. ",

I hadn't really noticed it before, but I turned 64 this month and just saw the title, and said, \"Yes, I fit in here!\" I agree with what you all have said about feeling so bad for those with young children. Mine are 26 and 30, they are doing well and really don't \"need\" me at this point, but I'd love to be around to see their lives progress and to meet any grandchildren that may come along. Considering that so many women are facing leaving young children, and even babies, it does sound a bit selfish in comparison. But I know you all get it. Crone, I am not sure I've done such a great job helping my kids face my disease. I don't talk about it very often, and when I do, it's very clinical and mostly positive. I guess I don't want to burden them too early, as there will come a time when it's very evident and positivity will be harder to pull off. My son seems much more ready to face it, even though he's the youngest. He will often ask how I'm doing and really sounds like he wants to know. When my daughter asks, I know it's with a lot of anxiety and she's doing it because she \"should.\" Not that she doesn't care- I think she cares a lot which is why it hurts so much to go into it. I think I'd do as you are doing and let them be the guide as to how much they want to know and discuss. I've been lucky up to this point and have responded very well to Faslodex after some very hairy spinal mets that compromised my mobility. Since that time three years ago, I've been stable, have little pain, and function fully. I do think my time with this drug is nearing an end, as my tumor markers have been climbing steadily, although my scans don't show anything new...yet. My onc hasn't said the word yet, so I'm hoping to hang on to Faslodex as long as possible. It's been an easy and effective drug for me. Thank you, Crone, for the recommendation of Being Mortal. I will definitely look into it. I look forward to getting to know all of you and hope this thread continues.",

It requires inecting a dye hours beforehand, and your surgeon then has to know how to trace the dye to find those few nodes that the dye went to.  The axillary is easer.  You go in and get them all.  You really don't want to try to twist the surgeon's arm to do a procedure they aren't comfortable with. You don't want your mom to be a guinea pig!   If your mom is not comfortable with the full axillary dissection, she should find a surgeon who is experienced with the sentinel node procedure. The full axillary will definitely be safe and everything as far as cancer treatment goes, but she will be at risk for more swelling problems down the line.    If it were me, I'd go with the second opinion and try to get the surgery as soon as possible.  Maybe the doc who gave the second opinion knows another surgeon she/he can recommend who has an opening..?  Good luck to you and your mom!   ",

She's been through many treatments but is still here, living her life seemingly in good spirits. She's currently undergoing a new radiation treatment to her spine which she says seems to be working, along with Xeloda. We talked a bit about her treatments, but also about gardening and finding the best fertilizer for roses in SoCal. :) She has full mobility and drove herself to her appointment. Meeting her made my day. Yes, we have had longer lives than many of our BC sisters, and while I appreciate that, I also have a lot that I'm looking forward to and don't want to miss. I try to put my diagnosis in a box most of the month, until I have to go in for my treatments, and meeting someone who has handled her cancer so gracefully for so long definitely was an inspiration.

I realize that this situation will change at some point, and I'm trying to really enjoy this pain-free period as long as I can. What chemo are you currently taking? I just noticed that you are pr-, like myself. ;)  ",

It sounds like you have a very effective oncologist. Have you stayed with the same one throughout your disease? Hope you women in the north east and mid west are staying warm during these snowy months.

I would definitely be doing the chemo with your score-this is what you would get if you had joined the TailorX trial, so the evidence is in favor of chemo all around, it seems.  I am glad that you have your new oncologist. You will have her input regarding the type of chemo you'll be getting, and this second opinion will be valuable in either corroborating the choice of your  old onc, or giving you a different choice.  Either way, it's a good thing! And don't feel guilty!! The timing is excellent, actually, as you'll have someone you can relate to  during this phase of treatment.

It's very likely that it could replace radiation therapy in many instances.  And of course there's the possibilty of using it for primary tumors, like BC, but I guess that's a few years down the road. There have been a few small trials outside of the US for primanry tumors,, but none totally successful yet.  Apparently there has been a lot of success with bone mets (for pain, like radiation) and it has been approved in Europe for this purpose.  Come on, FDA, let's see it happen!",

I know for certain that that's just not true. Had my mets been found a year before (and I know they were there) I would never have crushed my vertebra and experienced nerve damage.  I would have been more careful with my back and not carried 35 pounds down the Grand Canyon, or spent hours in the garden lifting heavy pots.  Had I known my back was at risk, I would have behaved differently and my outcome would have been improved, even if the treatments didn't make any difference.  And I think the hormone blockers really do make a difference- they have stopped my bone mets that were running rampant for three years in their tracks.   Don't let them tell you it's not necessary. Insist, and they will do it.   I'd suggest every two years for the first few years, and then maybe every three or four after that.  Nearly 30% of early stage cancer patients ( I-III) will have mets at some point down the line.  It can only help to know earlier.",

Why not wait a few years and see how it goes. If you get pregnant, breast feeding is something you will probably want to do, and I wouldn't want to take that from you at your age. If you continue to monitor yourself closely, and I would recommend a breast MRI every two years, not just a mammogram yearly, I believe you will be able to make a decision down the line about the mastectomy. Remember that it has been shown that lumpectomy is as effective as mastectomy in removing tumors, if that were to occur. I understand that the breast removal now would be to prevent the cancer ever recurring. I just think you should take more time to make this decision. Maybe after you have your children? Just my thoughts. Good luck to you! This is the advice I'd give my daughter, even though she has a mom with cancer.",

Then it's sent to the lab to find out it's characteristics.  If the tumor is small and there is no evidence of spread, there is often no PET or scan offered that would make distant mets show up. Sometimes they will do a breast MRI, which I had, to  make sure that there was nothing in the other breast and to confirm the single tumor. But most women don't get bone scans or PETs until after surgery, and often not until there is some symptom, like bone pain, that triggers a scan.    Personally, I think women should be more agressively tested, and many who think they are Stage 1 at diagnosis may not be.  But with a small tumor and no lymph node involvment, it's unusual to have a Stage IV diagnosis within the first year. But it happens. You are lucky that your onc gave you a PET scan.  That sounds like good care to me.  If the docs know that you are already Stage IV, they often wait to do surgery until you've had some systemic treatment.  But with Stage I (which is assumed with the appearance of a small tumor), surgery first is the norm.",

It makes me feel a bit disconnected from myself, but I just don't have it in me to say, \"We'll, everyone is fine in the family, but I'm Stage IV now.\"  It will just cause them to ask questions that I don't want to answer, or feel sorry for me, which I don't want either.   It sometimes makes me feel that I'm living on a different planet from everyone else in my life.    My family, and a couple good friends, are very supportive, but even with them, I don't talk about it much. It's too depressing, and I don't like to worry or upset them.  I just think it's part of the deal. Thank god for all of you wonderful women (and the occassional man) who really know what it feels like to be in this weird cancer world.   ",

This seems to be the current standard of care- and by many, considered the best care we can hope for at this point.  There are many different hormonal drugs, and after the one you're on fails, there will be others to try.  It's sort of kicking the can down the road, so to speak.     I know you're devasted now, but chances are that you have many years left, and while on hormonals, many good years.  My bet is that you will see your son graduate, and more.  Best of luck, and keep us posted with concerns and progress.  Also, I had a right mastectomy.  It's not a piece of cake, by any means.  I did it at the time to prevent recurrance.  If the docs don't think it will help you at this point, I wouldn't rush into it. All surgeries have risks, and you would still have cancer even without your breasts.  Unless I felt that my prognosis would change, I certainly wouldn't sign up for surgery at this point.",

First, though, you might ask for a DEXA scan, which will show the amount, if any, of osteoporosis that you have. If you have bone loss, I think your onc would not hesitate to prescribe Fosomax or Boniva. Yes, mets disease does outweigh that, imo. The studies are a bit contradictory, but seem to be changing in favor of \"yes, they help protect against bone mets.\" My onc wanted me on one back when I was Stage 1 taking Aromasin. I balked because of the side effects. Three years later, I had mets to my bones. Would it had made a difference had I started a bisphosphonate when suggested? Maybe. What I do know is that once I had mets, I started taking Xgeva and it has really helped my bones get stronger. If I could go back in time, I would take a bone drug from the get-go. The side effects are kind of scary,but most of the problems come from the injected Xgeva, infusions of Zometa, or from people who have been on the drugs more than 5 years. It seems that asking for a Dexa scan would be a good starting point.",

I have some skull mets, and they are treated just like other bone mets.  I would worry that once you take out the one met on the skull, others would soon appear.    Irish is correct in that cancer in the bone doesn't jump to another organ that it may be touching- it travels through the blood and sets up shop that way.  At least that's how my oncologist explained it to me. Whatever you are taking for your bone mets will also help your skull mets.  Surgery is very drastic and has it's own complications.  You probably should consider another opinion from a cancer center or teaching hospital.    Also, talk to a radiologist.   I had bone mets that were pressing into my spinal cord.  The concern of course, is that the compressed spinal cord affects nerves that affect mobilty.  There was never a concern that the bone mets would \"jump\" into my spinal cord and infect it.  I had a course of radiation on the mets that released the pressure on the spinal cord, and now that area is fine.  I would think radiation would be a very likely treatment if they felt a bone met was compromising part of the brain tissue.     ",

I'm terminal. I will not \"get through this.\"   I now understand what he meant, and I think it applies to the advice about diet and exercise. I had been juicing daily, walking 3-5 miles a day, working with a trainer on flexibilty and strength, eating organic fruits and veggies, taking D3 and a few other things and was actually otherwise very healthy when I discovered my mets. I was feeling great. In fact, I think I actually crushed my spine while doing one of the exercises with my trainer.  I now realize that I did get through my treatments,  I gained all of my mobility back and have resumed my normal life.  I still am stage IV of course, but I'm sure that my overall good health enabled my bones to heal more quickly and helped me regain my strength.    Honestly, though, I have relaxed a lot about my eating since my mets diagnosis. I was under the impression that being very vigilant would keep cancer at bay.  It did not. So while I still eat well and excercise, walk, take my supplements, I also allow myself treats and enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner a couple of nights a week, and don't feel guilty. The goal is to feel well and live well, whatever that means to each of us.",

The recovery is long with the traditional fusions, although better with the minimaly invasive procedures. I wasn't a candidate for those procedures, as my spine was too damaged by the cancer. But it's worth mentioning that two of the surgeons would have done the surgery, even with my mets to the spine, had I wanted to go through with it.      I would definitely talk to a few spinal specialists at well respected spine centers, if you can get to them.  They can look at your MRI and tell you what is possible and the pros and cons according to your particular case.   Good luck!   BTW, I'm taking Xgeva, which I started after my bone mets were found.  All of the surgeons I talked to thought that was a good thing, and would help rather than hurt my situation and the stability of my spine in  general.  I think Zometa would be in the same bucket.",

      "Content": "Mar 17, 2015 04:13PM - edited Mar 18, 2015 08:19PM by sandilee So sorry you have to find yourselves here. I'm sure others will chime in, too. While I agree with my onc that chemo probably wasn't warranted ( I had intermediate oncotype- 18) at the time, it might have been a good idea, and may have knocked out the cancer initially, as it was in my blood. I'll never know. He didn't think it was worth the side effects in my case, so he started me on Femara. Even the side effects from that seemed too severe to me at the time, so he switched me to Aromasin. In retrospect, I might have done better had I stayed on the stronger drug, if not chemo. What I do know is that I wasn't perfect about taking my Aromasin, either. I forgot sometimes and didn't realize what effective meds the AIs really are. If I could go back in time, I'd be much more diligent and would probably stay with the stronger drug. I did exercise a lot-- 5-6 mile walks with my lab most days. I hiked to the bottom of the Grand Canyon with a 35 pound pack. I worked out with a trainer. In fact, what brought me to the doctor to discover my bone mets was a broken vertebra caused by an exercise I shouldn't have been doing. I basically broke my back while using one of those exercise rollers during a workout with my trainer, as the cancer had weakened my spine. As for eating, I've always been good. Never smoked and rarely drank alcohol and don't eat a lot of red meat. I love making veggie smoothies and for a a year before my mets I was using something called \"Green Vibrance\" in my smoothies to make sure I got all the nutrients I needed. Actually, this is not something my oncologist would have liked, as he always said that real food with the natural amounts of vitamins that food provides is the way to go. Overdoing it can get your body out of whack. He actually told me not to take a multivitamin! I didn't listen. The other thing he suggested a couple of times, and I refused, was to use a bisphosphonate to strengthen my bones. I had read so many horror stories about them that I thought they would do me more harm than good. Remember, I was thinking \"I'm done,\" so the fact that they have shown to prevent bone recurrence didn't sway me. I only had a little osteoporosis, and I wanted to fix it through exercise and diet, not risk the known side effects of strong drugs. I took an over the counter bone formula with strontium, and that actually did help my osteo, but not my cancer. I should have taken the stupid drug and my bones probably wouldn't have been so severely messed up when/if the cancer did hit the bones. I've now taken 2 years of Xgeva, and it's helped heal my bones. So, I guess I would say I wished I had taken my diagnosis a bit more seriously and hadn't bought into the \"you caught it early so you'll be fine,\" mantra. I worry and wince when I read early stage ladies giving up on Tamox or an AI before even trying because they don't like taking things that can harm your body. I understand some women are more sensitive than others and the side effects can be tough, but at least try it. It often gets better with time. People need to hear that for 30% of women with early stage cancer, it will return. One thing I would suggest to all early stagers is to insist on a follow-up scan- bone and CT or PET,- two years out from your surgery, and then 5 years out. It's not standard of care, but insist anyway. In my case, the cancer cells were in the blood and couldn't be seen on a scan at first, but two years out it would have shown up. Had I done that, I would have caught my mets at an earlier stage and may even have been able to get to NED with rads. And I wouldn't have been doing exercises that really weren't safe for me to do. Beg for some kind of scan, and be conscious of any back aches or bone issues and don't dismiss them. I don't believe that this disease can be stopped with natural therapies alone. I think getting a good, moderate but not overly ambitious amount of exercise can help both physically and mentally, and eating a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables along with low fat protein diet with moderate to low (empty) carbs is the way to go. I now only take a few pills- calcium, vitamin D3, magnesium and Turkey Tail mushroom extract (my one salute to alternatives ;). I think everyone needs to find a diet they are comfortable with that they feel good on and about, and not stress too much over it. There isn't one special thing that will keep you safe, in my opinion. Try to be healthy overall and listen to your body, find an oncologist you really trust, be diligent about your meds and get a follow-up scan after 2 years, or earlier if you have concerns. Good luck.

A lot depends on the size and number of liver tumors, probably, in your doctor's mind. If there are just a few, he might be happy to let the hormonal try to work longer, but if he is worried about the liver getting out of hand, I can see why he would want to hit them with an effective chemo. In this case, if you trust your doc, I'd probably lean toward his suggestions, as he has been on this road a few times, as they say. On the other hand, you can always get another opinion if you have doubts about his recommendation. Your results on Wednesday may make it easier to make a choice. If things have stayed stable, he probably will be ok with letting things go a bit longer. I am sort of in the same position with Xeloda. I was on Faslodex for three and a half years for bone mets when the cancer moved to my liver. I went on Femara/Ibrance for three months, and my tumors increased in size. So off that I went, and on to Xeloda. So far, the scans have showed they reduced in size and are stable (eight months on this drug.) He may want to take me off of the chemo to try another hormonal that I haven't tried yet, but I wanted to stay on Xeloda awhile longer, as it was working. He agreed since my tumor markers have settled (they had been slowly rising, even with the stable scans) but his idea is that a hormonal can work longer generally than a chemo, although a chemo can kill off a lot of cancer so that a hormonal can be tried again. Maybe if you have 12 weeks of Taxol, and your liver tumors regress, he would be open to going back on a hormonal to keep things stable. This whole thing is an art as much of a science, I think, and there often is no one right answer. Good luck to you!",

What I think was happening, in retrospect, was that my spine was fracturing and dislocating the rib it was attached to, and causing the pain to go from back to front.  But it did go away.  Shortly after that, ( a couple of weeks, I think) I experienced the nerve compression that eventually took me to the doctor, where they discovered mets throughout my spine (and ribs).      I'm wondering if all of the pressure you were putting on the muscles while you were drilling might have caused some dislocation of either your rib or your vertebra, resulting in the rib being affected to.  I'm so glad you're going to the doc today, and yes, I'm sure they will want to take a look.  If you have moved anything around and the nerves could be compromised, you want to know now rather than later. In any case, I really hope you are feeling better.  I'm so sorry you've had such a lousy month.",

The first thing I would say at this point is to try not to let your mind get ahead of itself. You are not \"there\" yet, and may never be.  Secondly, if you do have mets in your bones, it's not a death sentence.  Thirdly, you must not blame yourself. Of course we all have pains. If every time we had a pain we rushed into the doc for a scan, they'd soon stop listening to us.  Heck, I let my back pain go for over a year because it was off and on, and the nurse practicioner at the oncologist's said that only if the pain is constant do I need to worry.  Cancer doesn't follow rules.  Blaming anyone, least of all yourself, is not helpful.  If you do get bad news, know that the fear will lessen, and you will adjust to the new \"normal.\" You will be able to have a fairly normal life, except for the tests and treatments that will keep you stable.  I remember when I mentioned to my onc that I didn't want to have surgery for my back because if I only had a couple of years to live, why would I want to spend a year of it in recovery? He looked at me and say,\"Why do you think you only have two years?  I have patients I've been treating with this for 15 years.  We can treat this.\"   And this is with mets to my entire spine, ribs and spinal bone marrow.  My back has now recovered to the point where surgery isn't necessary. I've been stable for 9 months, and hope to be here for many more years.  And I feel well, too.  Try to put this out of your mind this weekend. Be sure you have someone with you when you hear the news, whatever it is, on Monday.  Let us know, either way. We'll be rooting for you and hope you discover arthritis and aging bone degeneration.  {{{{hugs}}}}      ",

I take very good care of myself- weight has always been good- and started exercising a lot more  after my first diagnosis.  I also added a lot of healthy juicing and vitamins to my routine, but now I'm wondering if all of my supplements just helped my vascular system grow stronger to support the cancer!  I've never smoked, rarely drink, eat organic (not vegan, but plant based diet with wild fish and organic meats when I have them), and walk 3+ miles most days. I have a wonderful, supportive husband, two healthy and self-supporting adult kids, and a peaceful homelife- even lucky enough to be early retired.  One of the unfortunate things about this disease is the constant temptation to second guess ourselves. What did I do wrong? What should I have done differently?    As someone with very few risk factors for this disease (other than being female and having my kids fairly late in life--34) I have long stopped asking myself what I might have done to either cause or bring back my cancer.  The truth is, it's a very sneaky bastard, and you can do everything right--everything- and still find yourself here.  The combination of our own genetic make-up and a variety of environmental factors that plague our advanced societies are the cause, and each of us has our own biological vulnerabiltiy to those factors.  That's not to say that all of the healthy habits are worthless. I don't believe that at all, and attribute my feeling pretty well and recovering from some serious mobility issues caused by my recurrance,  to my trying to do the right things. I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think any of us can say what caused our cancer to return.  In many cases, it never completely left, even if we thought it did. Enjoy each day, and try not to obsess about recurrance. You are doing the best you can to stay healthy, and that is a good thing and all you can really do.   Try to find joy in each day, and appreciate the health you now have.  ",

With the people I am close to, like my best friend or one of my kids, I usually tell them when I'm having a scan or a certain test.  It's really heartwarming when I get an email from my son asking \"How did your scan go on Wednesday,\" or \"Did you get your results yet?\" from my best friend.It makes me realize they are thinking about me and know that this is important, and may be life-changing in terms of treatments. The rest of the time, like others who posted above, I prefer my friends act as they always have. I still care about their problems, and want to hear about them providing they are sharing something that is important to them, like family issues or work problems. I still wantt them to come to me if they need support in some way, like they always have.  What I am less sympathetic to is listening to complaints about minor physical ailments, petty gossip or a lot of negative energy directed at the world in general.  I find I want to spend my precious time on earth enjoying the laughter and love of my friends and family, and also being there for them when they might need me. The only things I can think of not to say or ask is anything that might imply that she didn't take good enough care of herself, or any suggestion that eating a certain thing or taking a certain drug would have changed her outcome.  It's hard to imagine that someone who would post the kind of sensitive question that you posted would do that anyway, but for anyone reading, I'd caution that these kinds of suggestions can seem a bit critical and judgemental.  As a woman who is battling the disease herself, I doubt that I need to tell you that! ;)    I wish the best for your friend, and she's lucky to have you. ",

You are obviously worried that your bone aches might be mets, and I don't blame you.  What you might want to do is tell your oncologist about your pains and your concerns, and ask to have a PET or bone scan at some point, preferably before you make your decision about surgery.  One reason for this is, you might want to only have the tumor removed- not a complete mastectomy or BMX- if you already have bone mets.  Your preferences in  treatments might differ depending on your staging.  At the very least, get a scan and then find out what your doctors advise.   {{{{{many big hugs to you}}}}} cookiegal,     I don't think the answers to your questions are known.  I've heard of no studies looking into these kinds of comparisons.  It's really hard to know about a negative- in other words, how would you know if chemo slowed a progression if you can't know how it would grow without it? Because everyone's cancer is so different in type and speed of progression, I don't think we have the tools to measure this type of thing- at least not yet. And of course, whatever statistics might show, it would actually not mean much for any individual woman.     ",

That is difficult, cancer or not.    I completely understand your concern about the docs not taking the possibility of mets seriously.  You are wise to follow up if they don't with either a bone scan or, if possible, an MRI.  You say your insurance won't pay for a bone scan?  Is that true even if your oncologist orders it?  I didn't think insurance could turn down  a diagnostic scan if the doc feels that the previous scans don't do the job and they still have questions.  Bone scans are cheaper than MRIs, so that might be something worth pushing for.   CT scans can sometimes show bone mets, but not always.  The same with X-Rays. Mine didn't show up on X-Ray so an MRI was requested by the doc- but then they knew I had a problem because I was numb from the chest down at that point.  I get CTs at regular intervals for spread from bone, and sometimes the worst bone mets are mentioned on the report, but only in general terms in obvious spots, which is why I say sometimes they show up. Bone scans \"light up\" the way a PET would in the cancer areas, so they are  really useful- and cheaper. Being still Stage I, it is hard to get doctors to to respond as aggressively with scans- I remember that well.  I was complaining about pain for over a year before my Stage IV diagnosis, but because it came and went, it wasn't considered serious enough to scan for. All I can say is keep pushing until YOU are satisfied. Good luck.",

Yes, you will be in treatment for the rest of your life, but to think it will only be 5 years is most likely wrong. I'm still here. I will repeat what vlnrph said in that the data out there is old and outdated, and no longer applies with all the newer treatments. It sounds like you have good care, as your doc already has sent in for Foundation One. Take a deep breath and realize that no one has an expiration date stamped on their foot. You will soon be on a new treatment plan and knocking those liver tumors back. Once you get over the shock and start living again, you will have a new appreciation for everything good in your life. Since I was diagnosed, I lost my mother, my mother-in-law, and my son, all of whom I thought would outlive me. You just never know what's around the corner, so don't make any assumptions. Take each day as it comes. Best of luck to you.",

I also had really bad rib pain on one side that was also from the vertebra not supporting it, and some back pain.  I had 15 sessions and after my three weeks were over, the numbness was almost completely gone and the rib pain was reduced a lot. About a month later, I had no rib pain and no numbness.  I still needed occasional pain meds for my back aches for a few months, but after that, nothing.  It's been nearly three years now, and I  don't need any pain meds to get through the day at all- I just have to be careful not to overdo.(also on Xgeva and Faslodex)    So I'm a fan of rads. My rad onc said, also, that if I needed it again in the future, he could do it again. I was surprised they could do it twice, but maybe it would be in a slightly different spot. Anyway, it's reassuring to know that if my back gets bad  or my spinal cord is compromised again, I can have additional radiation.  Good luck to you!",

I answered because the pain you describe sounds a lot like what I felt before my spinal and rib mets were found. I don't mean to alarm you, but I assume you are here to get information. What feels like the back of your lung could also be a rib or your spine. The good news, if it is mets, is that both the pain and the growth of bone mets can be controlled with many of the medications that have been developed over the last 10-20 years. A regular x-ray may not show bone mets, so it would probably be a good idea to have an MRI or a bone scan. Do you still see your oncologist every few months or so? Tell him or her about your pain and request a scan. Let them decide which is the best for you, but insist on one. Feeling the way you do, I think that a scan will either confirm your fears, or give you peace of mind. You'll be able to move forward, either way. Good luck!  ",

You should be able to see them with your own eyes. Have them explain the pathology report from your liver biopsy. If you still have doubts, you can take a copy of these reports to another medical center for a second opinion, both for the diagnosis and treatment. I can't imagine living with such doubts and confusion about my disease. No wonder you doubt your medicine is helping you. You deserve answers and an explanation you can wrap your head around. Please don't just stop taking your meds before you have all of the information to make an intelligent decision.It sounds like you are taking an aromatase inhibitor, from the sound of your symptoms of pain. There are other treatments that might be easier on you. I had pain with an AI, but none with Faslodex, for example. The drugs do help, and can prolong your life for many years.",

My surgery was scheduled for 1:30, but it takes a while for the dye to travel up the nodes, so they allow a few hours. I think I was out of surgery by about 3:30, I'm not sure, as it took awhile for the anesthetic to wear off and for me to actually be able to talk and remember what was said. (Apparently my anesthesiologist talked to me and answered some of my questions once I woke up, but I have no memory of that conversation whatsoever)   I stayed around for a couple of hours- my husband was with me- and the nurse showed my how to empty the drains and everything. I left the hospital around 6pm, and no, there was no way I could have driven myself home. I was sort of wobbly.  When I got home, I had dinner, and it tasted great.    I would suggest that you communicate your preferences with your surgeon ahead of time, so she can schedule your surgery at a time that would allow you to go home that first night if you're up to it.  I had the option of staying overnight, but told my surgeon that I really wanted to be able to go home. She said that as long as they don't need to do the whole node dissection, and can limit it to the SNB, I should be able to. If they had found cells in my nodes, they would have taken more, and I probably would have had to stay.   I'm 5 weeks out, plus two days, and I feel great. I'm pretty much fully functional. I was driving after about two weeks, after my drain came out.  I don't think I would have been comfortable driving much before that, but everyone is different in how quickly they heal.   My advice...take it easy!  The better you treat yourself those first couple of weeks, the faster your total recovery.",

After several months of Xeloda and a relatively stable scan, my onc took me off the chemo and put me on Tamoxifen, as I'd never tried, even at early stage. I've been a bit nervous these months, partly because Tamox is so easy that it's hard to believe it would do anything. After my successful three years on FAslodex, and my several months of Xeloda, I feel like I'm taking a sugar pill. Not only have my peeling hands and feet completely healed, I have great energy! So I went into my scan last week figuring I'd have progression, as my tumor markers are going up, but hoping I could delay another round of chemo until after my daughter's wedding in September. Just got my results from the Lab, as I always do before I see the doc, and I'm kind of happy! The largest liver lesion has reduced in size by 4-5 mm, and my bones in the area are stable. There are a couple of other smaller liver lesions- less than a cm, that have increased slightly in size. But nothing seems wildly out of control. So, while not perfect, it seems ok to me, for now. I think when I see the doc tomorrow he will let me stay on the Tamoxifen for another three months, at least. I'd be surprised if he wants me back on chemo yet, because he's big into quality of life and nothing seems out of control. So, Yay for me! I don't think I'll have to go to my daughter's wedding in the middle of chemo! At least that's what I'm counting on. He may be more concerned about my markers than I am, but we'll see. I'll share what he says tomorrow. So glad to hear so many here are doing well. Hugs to all. Sandilee",

They usually only use a local anesthetic, but I was nervous and asked the doctor on the spot for some pain meds in my IV, and gave me some Fentanyl - just enough to make the whole thing painless. You need to be awake because they ask you to hold your breath while they insert the needle, but you can do this while having meds. You need to stay in the hospital for a few hours afterwards to make sure you don't bleed, they will probably give you something to eat and you can have a visitor most likely. I went home and had no issues the following day, although they say no heavy lifting for a couple of days. Don't worry. It really isn't a big deal. But don't be shy about asking for pain meds.",

He wanted to see me often because I was debating spine surgery, and we weren't sure about the Xgeva, or what my best option would be.  I was also undergoing radiation every day for three weeks.  I 've had two MRIs, two bone scans and two CT scans between June and December. He wanted to do another in January, but I sort of put it off until February. I won't see him this month at all, but will see him in February.  I get the sense that scans of some kind will be every three to four months for the forseeable future.I'll probably meet with him every month or certainly every two months, but I do go in for my Faslodex, Xgeva and blood draw every 28 days.  ",

As Caryn said very eloquently, your treatment will be based on what they find after your surgery. It is true that if you and your doctor decide that a lumpectomy is in order, radiation will most likely be part of the treatment. This is done to kill any residual cells that may be left behind in the surrounding area and chest wall. Radiation is not usually done with a mastectomy, but sometimes, depending on the margins and the surgeon's recommendation. I was really nervous about radiation when i was first diagnosed. In fact, it's one of the main reasons I chose mastectomy! In retrospect, my fears were really misplaced, as I later had radiation treatments to my spine for progression four years later, and they were relatively easy to tolerate and caused no harm. The radiation killed the cancer in that area of my spine and enabled me to walk normally again, so I'm kind of a fan, now, lol! Chemo is definitely not something everyone gets. It's something you will discuss with your oncologist after your surgery, as the characteristics of your cancer will point to one therapy or another. Many women only get hormonal treatments, especially for early stage ER+. You will probably get a recommendation one way or the other, depending on whether your oncologist feels it will help you, based on statistics that relate to your tumor. There are also the Oncotype test that may be an option to help you make a decision, which is done after surgery with a portion of your tumor. It all seems so scary and overwhelming at first, but try not to get too far ahead of yourself with worry. I don't know if your health plan allows you choices, but if so, focus on finding a good doctor you like and trust . I asked friends and found someone on my own rather than waiting for a referral from my surgeon. Write down all your questions and take someone with you to your appointment. Don't be shy about asking anything and everything you want to know. Keep us posted with how you're doing, and good luck. It does get easier.",

The problem with MRI is that it usually only sees one section of your body at a time, so it could miss mets in hips if it's looking at the spine.  A full body MRI is unusual, I think, so if you suspect bone mets, I'd ask for a bone and CT scan.  I also think it's unusual for mets to appear in an arm.  I think they usually go for the spine, ribs and hips.",

Because none of us know what mets feel like until we're diagnosed, I think women often overlook a recurrance, thinking it's just aging or arthritis, etc. We're also reluctant to complain.  I think the standard of care for all Stage I, II and III women should be a complete work-up after two years- not waiting until a patient complains of pain. The mets are there long before the pain presents, and there are treatments now that can keep cancer down for years, and in many cases, prevent bone breakage and slow down the disease process. No cure yet, but if found early, a better quality of life can be had with earlier detection of metastasis.    ",

My calcium was over 11, I had the Sestamibi Scan and also an ultra sound from the surgeon. I was able to see the gland on the scan, and he gave me a picture to take back to my oncologist. ;) After the surgery, he said along with the right parathyroid gland that was very large, the other right one was \"funny looking,\" so he took it out, too. I had the minimally invasive surgery and left with a band aid on my neck. It left no scar at all. I don't remember what my parathyroid hormone level was, but it was high. I can't say that I noticed a difference in the way I felt after the surgery. I was feeling ok, overall beforehand. At that time, I didn't know that I had spinal mets. I did have some back pain, so I believe that I already had the mets but they were probably small. I've always wondered what part the parathyroid issues played in my BC. Did the weakness in my bones caused by the depletion of calcium due to parathyroid issues cause my BC to travel to my bones? Or did the cancer cause the parathyroid issues? Were the mets causing so much calcium to be broken down that the little glands had to work overtime and became sick? I think someday science will discover some kind of link, but it's kind of a chicken and egg issue, imo. Good luck. It really was not a difficult surgery to go through or recover from. The key is finding an experienced surgeon.",

I had radiation to my tumor on my upper spine when I was having walking/balancing issues, and it did help a lot. My tumor was pressing on my spinal cord, and after the radiation the cancer died back in that spot and allowed the spinal cord room to function.   Best of luck to your mom!",

Sometimes bone mets also have mets in the bone marrow, where the red blood cells are born. If your marrow is compromised with cancer (like mine) your counts can be low because your marrow can't make red blood cells fast enough. It's unlikely that surgery would cause anemia, but meds could. I do think the disease itself is a likely cause, though. If your onc isn't worried about it, don't fret too much. Mine have been low since I was diagnosed with mets, but my onc thinks it's fine. As long as my energy keeps up, it's not a big deal if they are a bit low. I'd be more worried about the shortness of breath, and I'd suspect the Zometa. I've heard other BC sisters complain of this SE. Would your onc consider letting you try Xgeva to see if you tolerate it better? It's an injection into the muscle (like a flu shot in the arm) instead of an IV. It may be easier for you.",

Four hours sounds brutal. I'd probably start with the local onc, see what they say and then go to the big center for a \"second opinion.\" If there is some way that the offices could work together to compliment each other, that seems like the best way to go. Also, I'm not sure that a biopsy is always necessary. It might depend if the treatment suggested would be changed if they found out it was a different type now. I didn't have one because my on was going to start me on a chemo regardless, as my previous hormonal treatments failed.If this drug doesn't work, I will then have a biopsy. If it does give me stability, we may try another hormonal to see how that goes.",

My mom and daughter both seem to be more in denial.   I'm disappointed that they haven't bothered to do any research or learn about the disease at all.  Everything they know about it comes from me.  I finally had to tell my mom that this disease is terminal, as I was tired of hearing her tell me that I'd get better soon, as if I have the flu or something. The next time I talked to her, she told me that she was \"terminal too\" and \"We all are!\"  In other words, I had no right to think I am in any way deserving of a little extra care or attention just because I have MBC, as we're all going to die sometime.  Bah. On the other hand, my dear husband and son have been great.  DH has been with me every step of the way and that is much more important, after all. My 23 year old calls me from his home 6 hours away every week as well as any day that I have an appointment, and wants to know how things are going. He asks all kinds of questions and tells me how much he cares- it really helps. He also has made two trips to see me since I was diagnosed with mets in July, just to see for himself how I'm doing since my cancer returned. Everyone reacts differently to the news, and sometimes it surprises us.     ",

I'll get my port on Monday and my first treatment of Doxil on Friday. The only other non-hormonal chemo I've been on in my nine years of treatment is Xeloda.

It does require very careful blood monitoring. My onc was considering A/A for my treatment after progression, but luckily Ibrance was approved just in time. Also, he was familiar with the trials as their office was involved in some way, and one of his close colleagues was a trial director at UCLA. I think the familiarity with it over the years of the trial made him less nervous about prescribing it.One of the things that worried him at first was whether insurance would cover it, as it's about 9K a month. Again, just in time for me, companies are covering the cost, for the most part. And the drug company has a program to help patients with the co-pays. I am currently paying less for Ibrance/Letrozole monthly than I was paying for my Faslodex. One thing I will say about Affinitor is that if it does work for you, it can be very effective. It's just that so many women find that they can't tolerate it. But if you're one that can,it can beat back the cancer for many.",

I trust this guy (known in my community as one of the very best) and believe he was recommending what he would recommend for his own wife.    He also mentioned that he feels the real percentages  for recurrence are actually lower than the test reports, primarily because when this study was done with the thousands of participants in the 80s, they didn't check the lymph nodes as closely as they do now with the new staining techniques. So many of the study participants likely had positive nodes  that were not detected. He felt very comfortable just putting me on the aromatase inhibitor.   One interesting thing for me was that the genetic test considered me pr negative, unlike the path report that put me at 1% positive. My negative pr standing was considered in my oncotype score.    I am happy with the result and with my oncologists take on things, and I wanted to post this for others looking to compare information.         ",

I did try Ibrance, but it was paired with Letrozole. Since Letrozole is not something that works for me( as an AI,) the combo failed me. I thought the Ibrance failed me but that was before I had the Foundation One and realized it was no doubt the Letrozole that was the failure.

My onc said that it had probably been growing for 7 or 8 years. Large tumors don't generally pop up that quickly, so in my humble opinion, the \"quick growth\" probably means it's not cancer.

Explain the situation and ask if they have any ideas as to how to persuade your insurer. Second, talk to your doctor and find out if he has any other patients on this med, and see if they can help you. They should be the main advocate for you in getting this approved. One way your doctor has of \"persuading them\" is to tell them that the other med you would be prescribed if this one is denied is just as expensive. For instance, Affinitor is no cheaper than Ibrance. So what would they gain here? Your doctor can also explain why this drug is the best choice for you at this time. I didn't have any trouble, but I have insurance through my husband's company, and they self insure with Athem/Blue Cross of California as administrators, so that probably can't help you. However, so far everyone on the Ibrance thread has eventually been approved, so hang in there. I think they just like to deny at first to see if they can get away with it. Enlist your doctor's help here and it should be ok.",

It's hard when you are used to being someone people count on, or when friends want you to join them but you just would rather stay home and read a book. I'm 7 years our with stage 4, and it's now in liver as well as bones, and of course treatments are constant. My friends know this, but it's amazing how they still expect me to have the energy I've always had. I dread the open invitation like, \"Let's plan to get together next week. What day is good for you? \" I know I should feel grateful that they care, and I am, but often I want to say,\" No day is good, sorry.\" A week with no doctor's appointments is a good week, so I need to guard my time. If I have a couple of appointments, and then accept social invitations that I'm lukewarm on accepting, I start to feel like I have lost agency in my life. So I say no more often and I try to only do the things I really want (or need) to do. It sounds selfish, but I need that right now. My husband is supportive and does seem to get it most of the time, and I truly do appreciate that.",

It's just one tool doctors use to help them decide about treatment.    One thing I do want to mention because of one of your comments, and that is there is no such thing as a \"cure\" for Stage 1 breast cancer, regardless of what your doctor told you. Your cancer may or may not return, although with Stage one, the odds are with you that it won't, and yes, your prognosis is very good.  But there really are no guarantees.You need to be vigilant in the years to come, and make sure you have follow-up scans down the line.  Don't let anyone tell you it's not necessary to have any scans because \" you caught it early and only have Stage 1.\"  This is a mistake too many women make, including myself.   You want to continue to be monitored.   Be sure to get all of the details of your diagnosis at your next appointment, ask as many questions as you can, and take a notebook to keep all of your results.  If you have a husband or someone close to you to go with your to your appointments, that will help. Everything is a little overwhelming at first, but you will get a handle on it, and life does get more normal. Good luck to you. Please stay with us on the board and let us know how you are doing. ",

I already ate pretty well, but became pretty vigilant- juicing, eating mostly plant foods and excercising.  I joined a gym, and my husband and a friend of mine hiked the Grand Canyon in '09,  I was walking my dog 5 miles a day and feeling very strong.     When I hurt my back during a session I had with a fitness trainer,  I thought about going to a orthopedist to have it checked out.  A few days later, I woke up numb from my chest to my toes and I had no balance.  I saw the ortho the next day, and found out about my metastasis to my bones from the MRI taken at the orthopedists office. My T3 was collapsed and I had cancer throughout my spine and ribs.  I had 15 radiation treatments to my spine, and I now have all the feeling to my legs and balance back.  I'm also on Xgeva and Faslodex- love that combo and hope I can stay on it for a long time.    My biggest fan and supporter is my dear husband of 40 years.  Our two kids are grown, but they're not yet married and are still a large and wonderful part of our lives. I'm also grateful that I have a handful of very special, caring and understanding friends whom I love like family.

I didn't realize that Ibrance had been approved with Faslodex, but if your insurance pays, great! There are a bunch of us on the Ibrance /Palbociclib 2015 thread taking it with Femara, so you may want to take a look over there because I imagine that the side effects from Ibrance would be similar regardless of what you're taking it with. Faslodex is an effective drug on it's own, but I guess it's even better with the added Ibrance. It's also interesting that he's starting you on a lower dose. He sounds pretty enlightened. :) The larger doses have been tanking the white counts of many of us. My onc dropped me from 125 to 100, and next week I'll see how my white counts are doing at that dose. I had to wait an extra week to restart because my neutrophils had dropped below 1000. I know there are women who are eager to use Ibrance with Faslodex, so they will be interested in how you're doing.

Scheduling around the holidays added to the wait , but I did have the advantage of their distraction.  Hang in there. This is an important time to make decisions and mental adjustments. The biopsy of the lymph nodes will give you the final diagnosis,  but it sounds like the odds of negative nodes are in your favor with your negative scans at this point. For me the hardest wait was after surgery, waiting for the final, final results of the tests on the nodes they took out during surgery, which didn't come until about 5 days after my mastectomy.  Only then did I know that I probably wouldn't need chemotherapy or further surgery. And it was only \"probably\" on the chemo until my oncotype score came back- another month or so later.    Good luck to you, and don't hesitate to come here for the inevitable questions or support. We all know how you're feeling and how scary this is, but it does get better. ",

I'm hoping the jump was just a blip, but not optimistic.    I do feel well though.  Seems unfair that I might have progression when I'm feeling better than ever.  I was also on Xgeva along with Faslodex until last month.  My onc is very concerned about the long term effects of that drug.  He feels that the problems women have had with the drug all happen after the two year mark, and he says he's seeing more and more broken bones, etc. So....    I guess if it's a major side effect, like broken femors or ONJ, they pay attention. Things like aching joints or feeling like a 90 year old at 60 don't count for much.  I've been lucky with Faslodex, but I remember Aromasin was no picnic.",

How did they find your mets?  It sounds like you had a bone scan or MRI already.  How is your spine? Are you on a bone medication like Zometa or Xgeva?  You should ask your onc about that. When my bone mets were found, that was the first drug he wanted to put me on, even before my anti-hormonal.  Xgeva is easy--- quick injection in the arm, no infusion.  Hang in there. It gets easier as time goes on. {{{hugs}}}     ",

Every woman's prognosis is different because our cancers are different.  However, statistics that are out there are old and no longer really apply because there are so many new treatments. There is hope.   Your mom will probably not be cured, unless she lives long enough with this disease that they can find a cure. At this point, there is none. However, there are many, many treatments that can prolong her life and even give her a decent quality of life.  It depends, though, on what her particular cancer is and how it manifests in her. You can read on this board and learn a lot about the differences, and that may help you help her with treatments down the line.   Find a good oncologist that you trust, and keep educating yourself.  Chances are that your mom has many years to enjoy  life ahead of her.

I had a mastectomy with Stage 1, had no lymph node involvement and no discernible vascular involvement, but three years later, the cancer had spread to my bones. At this point, it's not in my soft tissue, as far as we know. I think if I had to do it over again, knowing what I now know, I'd have the lumpectomy as the docs suggested. I thought the mastectomy would make it less likely that my cancer would metastasize, but the statistics don't seem to bear that out. There really seems to be no advantage with regard to a distant recurrence.",

That is the same treatment I would go through if I had the AND, and they found a few others with micromets.  So, what exactly is the advantage of having further nodes removed?  The chemo is supposed to kill small cancers and single cells. I have made an appointment with my oncologist two days after I will see my surgeon, so that I can see where he stands.  There have been  studies in recent years that consider nodes with micromets the same as nodes that are clear. If my oncologist agrees, I will happily forgo the surgery.  If he doesn't, I'll be in a pickle!   We all have to weigh the risks and benefits and do what feels comfortable for us.  I detest surgery, (which is why I chose the mast with no reconstruction) and the continued use of my arm is very important to my quality of life.   But it's a gamble, I know, and there are no guarantees either way.",

The radiation killed the cancer in that spot and allowed the spinal cord to go back to its normal position.    I would expect that the docs will consider chemo as soon as the radiation treatments are over. Right now, the spinal cord is really a much more critical concern, and they want to get that handled. Once that is stable, then they will probably take a good look at chemo and the liver.  If they don't, that's something you should suggest.  Good luck to your dear mom, and you are such a sweetheart for taking care of her!",
