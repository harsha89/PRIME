The rad onc said it was important to do this because I had a 5 cm tumor and only a sentinal node biopsy. I had treatment 11 of 33 today. My left breast is getting pretty red. I was trying aquaphor. Today I changed to Walgreens Natures Finest Skin Oil with vitamin E and Aloe Vera. I also use plain corn starch. The onc said not to try anything without asking her first because so many over the counter things have additives that might worsen the skin. Pat",

I have facial hair growing in like crazy. That was not the plan.....good grief. Just fuzz on the top of my head. I shaved my legs for the first time in a couple of months....you know I did not miss shaving and tweezing. Here is hoping for some eyelashes and hair soon..............Best wishes..Pat",
