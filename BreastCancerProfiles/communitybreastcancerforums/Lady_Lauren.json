    "Content": "Lady_Lauren wrote: I will be 30 in one week and have already had a lumpectomy at age 22, and a core biopsy done about 3 months ago. I am BI RADS 3, with all issues with the right breast, concentrated on the right side of the breast. The radiologist wanted me to wait 6 months and repeat the ultrasound. I was not satisfied with this wait and see approach, especially with my history. I consulted with my OB-GYN who was infuriated with the radiologists approach. After her review of my reports from both 2007 and 2014, and a breast exam she has given me an order to consult a surgical oncologist. In addition to my rather large lump that appeared in mid 2014, my lump removed in 2007 has regrown rather rapidly. My appointment with oncologist is Monday, as it gets closer I only get more worried. Please help with any advice or guidance! Thanks Surgery 6/6/2007 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
