Twice in the last two years, I found a bright red patch on the under part of my breast, as well as a pimple looking thing. The red was warm to touch but faded away and did not return for a year. Then it appeared again during my pregnancy, and has not returned for 2 years. However, I have gotten this boil type thing in that area and I was able to squeeze pus out of it last week and again last night. It is purplish-red and seems infected. I had gone to my OB for it in the winter concerned about IBC and they told me no, it was not IBC.  I had a baseline mamo and then a diagnostic one due to a gland there were concerned with and the results found no evidence of carcinoma. But I am still concerned about IBC. I guess my question would be, could it present with a boil-like thing that oozes?  I appreciate all of your help. Log in to post a reply",
