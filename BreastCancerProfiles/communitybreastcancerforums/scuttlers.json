(in fact, I think that in 20 years he has seen a doctor for 3 issues in all). I feel, that in my humble opion, you are placing some of the blame for these antibiotic side effects on us. This is so very far from the truth. I nearly lost my DH because of the Levoquin reaction and because the medical personnel at the 3 different ER's I drove him to that night could not recognized the situation. He was covered with hives, could barely walk, and was incoherent by the time we reached the third ER and the doctor was standing by the front desk. This doctor had seen this before! He had DH in an ambulance on the way to Stanford within minutes. He knew this was life or death and that minutes count. DO NOT place the blame on overuse of antibiotics on the patients! (and for the previous posters, this is definitely and totally NOT the problem). The overuse of antibiotics is another issue, and lands right in the hands and control of the prescribing medical PROFESSIONAL.",

Received the policy towards the end of March with approval.  If death occurs in the first two years - it pays back the premiums that I paid in plus 10%.  (Where else can you get 10% guaranteed return nowadays?  I am looking at this as a savings account for the first two years.)  After two years it pays the $10,000 - up to my 100th birthday (we can wish).   I just noticed that it is guaranteed for ages 45+.  Wouldn't hurt to give them a call and see if they insure \"younger\" ladies.  Hope this helps. ",

I believe the key for me is catching progression earlier and making changes to stop the progression from becoming problems. NED, also known as no evidence of disease, does not mean \"cure\" (as my family thinks). I have to explain this to them each time I progress. I get the, \"but I thought you were NED, I thought you were cured.\". NED means that we have been successful in knocking the cancer down to where it can not be seen by the scans. So we continue to scan every 3-6 months until it can be seen again. And then we change the chemo cocktails until NED is once again achieved. Have always kept the Herceptin in the mix. Added Tykerb, which will also always be kept in the mix. Currently getting Ixempra with the mix which has been successful in knocking back the cancer enough that it can not be seen on the scans currently.",

Three children - son in Las Vegas, daughter in Portland, OR, and daughter in Boston area, MA. Grandchildren are 21, 14, 9, and 7. A great who is 2. My DH found me 20 years ago, and we married. It has been truly a magical life. We traveled the US in a motor coach for 17 years, full time. He worked in major commercial construction, I worked in surgery. We were able to see, visit, and experience 49 states! We stopped traveling and settled in Las Vegas where I was offered my dream job. Designing, implementing, and teaching a Surgical Technology Program at the college level. It was absolutely everything I had ever dreamed of. WHAM! On February 4th 2009, I was notified that I had Inflammatory Breast Cancer. I had never heard of this, but \"believed\" the hype of the pink ribbon. I fought hard (with positive attitude) through the chemo, had the BMX (so I wouldn't have to worry about the other breast), went through the rads. Changed my diet, juiced, exercised, all that jazz. Working, smiling, laughing - all the hoopla that is spread far and wide with the wonderful \"runs for the ...\". The week before Thanksgiving I got the results of my \"treatment\" followup PET scan. It was spreading, fast, the onc did not know what to do to stop it, go home and gather those you love - you will not live past Christmas. I went home and sent an email to MD Anderson begging for help. Within an hour (this was late in the evening), I received a call from a nurse there. YES, we can help you - magical words to my ears. You have to be here on Monday - it was Thursday, and we were flat out broke! I called my family, and took my car down for a title loan and scraped together enough money to get there. Within 3 days we had a plan. The team was amazing. Yes, Sherrie, you are going to die from IBC, No, it is NOT going to be this year. I go every 3 months, get fully checked, and am given plans to choose from. Then I come home for treatments. I came to BCO needing help tolerating some of the treatment. Bless these people, they got me through that time, and many times since then. You are my lifeline, my friends, my angels, my group. We basically gave away our home in Vegas (another story, another time) and bought a home back \"home\" in Idaho, where we went to high school, where we fell in love, where we have family. Thanks to BCO I knew to cash in my life insurance, apply for STD then LTD, and SSDI. We live a comfortable life in a house built in 1917. No mortgage, no payments, just life. I quickly learned the realities of breast cancer, in these four years. I believe in the beginning most of us go through the \"5 stages of grief\". It is necessary. Now I am in acceptance, and can really live life every day. I am no longer afraid or frightened. I no longer believe I can control this with diet, juices, or more. I know that I can live life to the fullest. I grieve when we lose our members to this horrid disease. But I am also very blessed and happy that I \"knew\" them and that I could call them my friends. BCO is very much a part of my therapy, my living, my sanity. I AM HERE. I AM ALIVE! I love every day. I love life.",

I am on Herceptin and Tykerb currently.  What were your SE from the Tykerb?  It was the women on this forum that gave me what I needed to try it again, and again - until I found a way to take it that was tolerable (although today, I am not sure...).  But today is today, tomorrow will be better. I am wondering if today (and yesterday) was difficult because I had the Herceptin.  Usually it has not bothered me, this week it has.  But this is the first time that I've been on the Tykerb for more than a week and then got the Herceptin.     Even when we are dancing with NED, we are still on Stage IV, and \"exit right, exit left\" is not the way we want to go.  So we research, we continue the treatments, we relish our good days, move through the bad days, and keep dancing.  When I get tired, I get on the forum and gain strength to continue - if only by reading.

This choice should not be based on fear. Knowledge is very important. I do not regret the choices I made. It was not an easy road, and I'm aware it will have some rough times ahead. Another day, another week, another year to see my grand children to laugh with my husband - it is worth it all. You may have to just be there with and for her.

That's pretty remarkable, right?!? She also told me that breast cancer can be considered cured after it's treated - the first time you have it. (or, in the rare instance of a second, completely different cancer) However, once it recurs, it will likely kill you and it is becomes impossible to cure. At that point, you can only manage the disease, like diabetes.   I understand the aversion to words like \"cure,\" but I am equally averse to scaring women to death & letting them think that breast cancer is a death sentence, because it's clearly not anymore. Lots of women avoid screenings because they're afraid of being told they have cancer, which they think means they're going to lose their hair, puke all the time & die a horrible, painful death. If we can portray an accurate picture of BC treatment, that's not all pink ribbons & rainbows nor is it death & suffering, we'll all be better for it. \" Shevawn - thank you for clarifying and for the apology. None of us meant to say that Stage I is less worthy. We were amazed that someone would post a cure seven days after diagnosis on a Stage IV Metastatic Forum. It seems very cruel, and I for one as others have stated have been really bothered by this statement. Also the statement that breast cancer is clearly not a death sentence anymore. For us, it is! It has caused unbelieveable pain (physical and mental), it has wrecked havoc with our lives. We are not nor will we ever be \"better for it\". Everyone of us hope sincerely that you are never in our shoes. You are so beautiful, so young, so needed by your son, so alive! What we want is for you and the rest of the world to understand that although awareness and early detection is happening - WE NEED A CURE, WE NEED IT NOW, too many are dying!!!! Personally, I feel your onc was wrong to tell you that you were cured by your surgery. And evidently, you did not believe this as fact, as you have gone on to have chemo, radiation, and hormone treatment. Many of us have cashed our life insurance policies (even the insurance companies understand we are dying), we are trying to live on disability as we can no longer work due to the side effects of our treatments and the limitations that breast cancer has brought to our lives. We are thankful for good days, we rejoice when we find another treatment that is working and we fight hard to endure the side effects of those treatments in order to gain another month, another year, with our loved ones. We would NEVER want any new members to \"this club\"; but we are here together to help each other through. We celebrate the little things together, we cry together, and we try to endure and hold each other up. We do want to let the people out there know that breast cancer is not pretty pink ribbons. It is hard when the popular thing is to cover up this reality. When even young women (such as yourself) believe this can be beat, that it is something that will make us a better person (there was nothing wrong with the person I was, I want her back), that pink ribboned parades and celebrations are helping. We want the millions to go to actually finding a cure and not into the pockets of corporations to make them richer. Many of us were there where you are, thinking that this was actually a fight that could be won. Until reality came crashing down. Now we can barely get through our children's birthdays and milestones without crying because we know it may be the last one we get to celebrate. Our lives are lived in 3 month periods, plans can be made for 3 months, then the scans and tests, if they are good, we can plan another 12 weeks. Somedays happiness is being able to make a meal, somedays it is simply being able to take a shower without crying for help, or making it to the bathroom in time. Not pretty, not pink, no amount of awareness running is going to remove this reality of what breast cancer truly is. You were not dismissed because of your Stage, we were shocked that you would make the comments on a Stage IV forum. The message did read as if you believed the oncologist. It angered us that an oncologist would say such an untruth. And it angers us that so many believe the propaganda, and do not know the reality. You are more than welcome here. No one has asked that you not be here, we do ask that you be sensitive to where we are in this journey.",

I know $527 premiums seem high, mine were $1289 for the last 2 years. UGH! finally going on Medicare next month. YEAH! (I hope). My current \"deductible\" on my primary insurance is 10,900. Then the coverage is 50/50 for out of area (most know I go to MDA, which is way out of area). My premium is $657 for that one alone. I have a secondary coverage which is also being COBRAed, bringing our COBRA payments up to 1289 per month. Luckily the two insurances have fiscal years six months apart. Somehow it works that the high deductible is paid by the secondary insurance, and then by the time a deductible is due on the secondary, the primary insurance covers it. The key though is what is the \"out of pocket maximum\". I meet mine within the first few weeks due to the extensive treatment and costs. I did find out that travel is covered and part of hotels. (I was totally shocked to find this tucked into the 178 page \"master plan\". You may want to get a copy of the master plan and study it. They even pay me mileage for the trips to and from the infusion clinic AND for driving to the drug store to pick up scripts. Saw an ad in the December issue of Woman's Day in the doctors office today, that said Susan Komen Foundation paid for some ladies' medical care for several years through a grant. Full page ad, would like to see how to apply and get one of those grants.",

I have no need for an oncologist who has an ego. He knows that. (I interviewed several when I moved to find one who would work with me and with MDA to give me the type of life that I want. In other words, if this jerk won't come around - especially after a straight forward discussion as to your expectations - then you need to find one who will. I do not deal with a PCP. I have enough appointments without throwing another doctor into the mix. I insist that my oncologist manage ALL my prescriptions. I told him that I do not want to be running from doctor to doctor to get prescriptions. And the final decisions are MINE not his to make. If I need anxiety meds, I let him know. If I need pain control, I let him know. If I need something to help with my libido, I let him know.

Although teaching college age super motivated students is endorphin producing (IMHO). Have never needed any numbing medication. I make sure they scrub the site gently for the appropriate amount of time to prevent infection. And then follow sterile technique to access. (wash hands, sterile gloves, do not touch the port without sterile gloves, etc.). I tell them to just do it, no count down. Never any pain whatsoever. And I also make sure they follow the correct procedure to flush it at the end. Have had the Power Port for 3.5 years and it is working strong. As for accessing for PET or other scans, it depends on if the tech has been trained and certified to access. That is why some can not access the port for the infusion. You can go to the chemo unit and get a nurse who is trained, but sometimes that is a hassle. I do it here at my home town unit because they always draw blood before any infusion or PET injection. I go to the chemo unit and ask them to leave it in until infusion time. At MDA, if I have lots of tests scheduled, I ask that my fist stop be on the chemo floor for port access, then leave it in all day for the other tests. My port is my second best friend, DH is my best!",

You do not say how long you have been married. Perhaps you might suggest to him to seek his \" counsel\" from a professional. A lot of men do not want to admit they can use the counseling, they think it makes them less of a man. A situation like yours can be a catalyst to get them there. A lot of us who have had our partner's actions hurt and disappoint. If you want it; this can be navigated with minimal damage to the relationship. And even can, in some situations make it stronger and provide him with ways to truly help the entire family through. It sounds like he understands the damage and loves you; is he willing to go the distance with you? Are you willing to go the distance with him. In my situation, just a couple of sessions with a professional brought things around. I would go right back into cousel in a heart beat if I felt the need to (in myself or DH).",

This seems to have escalated with the decision of BCO to \"upgrade\" the forums to cater to the MINORITY of posters who use cell phones, smart phones, and \"mobile devices\" to access the boards. We have lost our \"community\" and have been forced into a disconnected method of communicating with each other. I, for one, really miss the warm sense of \"family\" that we once had. And it has been difficult for me to adjust here. I know that I do not post nearly as frequently, even though I want to. Of course, this could also be because I am having a horrid time adjusting to new treatments. Anyway, using those shortcuts to composition is common with those who use mobile devices and that is the group that BCO has decided to design the new format for. I do not like the new format; but have to live with it or lose all the benefits of the forum. I'll adjust, with protest.",

You have come to a great place for information and support. Or if you read the stats (we all do, I think) put them into perspective and their proper place. Mine said 30% survival at 18 months - so I told myself that SOMEONE had to be in that group for it to exist, and I was going to be in that group. In just the last 3 years there have been tremendous advances. With IBC, I would highly suggest a consult with the \"experts\" if you can. MD Anderson is truly making cancer history. You really need to be in charge and on top of your treatments. Sorry you have joined the \"club\", it is not an easy journey. My first treatments were the TCH (yours) and in 2.5 months it will be THREE years! Of those 3 years, the last 19 months - NED! Also, you can check into SSDI (IBC is listed as compassionate allowance), accelerated payout on life insurance, long term disability (if you are working and this is in your benefits). Etc. All you can do to remove stress and be able to focus on healing and knocking CA's butt will help! PM me if you wish. Best of luck, but more than that - LIVE!",

He is my rock. I want to be in his arms, looking into his eyes when that final day comes. It would be a shame for him to have loved so deeply, and to be locked on the outside, and not be there. Yes, it will hurt but the memories of what we have will get him through. Your weekend sounds incredible! Make more of those memories, especially for him. Don't lock love out on the outside looking in. Don't let cancer take that love, caring, joy, away! If we had only had one day, one month, one year of that perfect being together - it would have still been worth it.",

Three years ago, I was told that I would not live through Christmas. I was in my first year, it was heartbreaking to friends and family. My children came to spend time with me. My brothers and sisters and mom and dad came. My friends came from far away places. Then I found a team that was more positive and gave me options, real options that worked! It is awkward to be doing OK (back to NED once again a couple of weeks ago) and to have them question how I am. Yes, I have advanced cancer. But I am doing OK. Sometimes I wonder if they think I over exaggerated 3 years ago. My DH needed an outlet to be able to talk and I let him know it was OK to talk, with some exceptions. Such as neighbors who I have contact with often. It has helped him to be able to clear his mind. And it helps me to be able to converse with daily contacts without the cancer being a topic. He needs to know you are OK, really and honestly OK. He also needs to be able to share his concerns with maybe his close friends. I am sure that you have let him know that if your condition changes, you will be honest and straight with him.",

The Tykerb is able to cross the blood brain barrier and targets the same as Herceptin (which is too large to get to any brain Metz). You may wish to ask your Onc about adding Tykerb. Watch the heart, mine is checked via MUGA scans. Every 9-12 weeks at the beginning and longer periods as time showed no problems. Now every 6-8 months. Hope you get the same results or even better!",

So don't settle being road blocked by the nurse! (at my first MDA appointment, I asked for and got my Oncologist's cell phone number.

ALL were approved (through compassionate care allowance) within 10 days of applications being filed! Yes, I was approved for SSDI and started the waiting period while on FMLA and drawing a full paycheck on my sick time accrued. The doc stipulated that I was NOT to work more than 4 hours per week. I turned in all my scans, reports, the whole HUGE file the day I turned in the SSDI application. I did on-line and took hard copy to the local office. Cool breeze, the benefits you receive for Stage IV from the employer will not count against being approved for SSDI. File SSDI immediately and get those benefits started as soon as possible. The benefits from the employer are benefits not earned income. My STD, LTD, and death benefits payments had no impact on the timing or the amount of SSDI. The important thing is to file ALL BEFORE losing employment. (which nixes the thought that you must not be working to qualify). If you are no longer employed, you are probably not cover by those benefits anymore. (I contacted the insurance company directly to get this information, HR told me to wait until after I was not working which would have disqualified the STD, LTD, and Death Benefits.)",

It doesn't matter that it matches your salary. As for accelerated benefits the doctor has to sign of that you are expected to die within a certain period of time. It is kind of hard to get this in writing but just ignore the emotional impact. It is the check in hand that matters. My doc kind of baulked but I told him to sign the paper or give me an absolute guarantee IN WRITING that I would positively live longer. He signed. I just called the insurance and asked them to send the paperwork for Accelerated Benefits. (remember, if you don't take advantage of the accelerated benefits now, you will lose them completely once you are no longer an employee.)",

I remember the first lovely woman that we lost from the boards when I first joined - Irina. I think of her a lot. Then when Olga lost her life to this horrid disease, I was near inconsolable. It hurt so bad. KonaKat was another soul who I admired and loved for her wonderful, delightful posts. And then there was Zoe and her Golden Thread. Each and every one is painful. But I don't leave anymore. There is a strength here, there is a need here. A need to be here for others, and a need that is filled for me. I make a note of treatments that work, and ones that don't. Here is the information that keeps me going. My first posts were \"help me get through Tykerb side effects\". I am still on Tykerb, thanks to the wonderful and helpful posts that were given at that time. I just finished a novel that had an impact statement that I will keep. \"They still exist, as long as there is someone around to remember them\". I remember them, I always will. And I hope that when my time comes, there is someone around to remember me. I do understand. The pain is real, especially the first ones that touch our hearts and our lives. Please come back when you are ready. We will be here for you, if you need us. We will be here for you, because we need you. LOVE and ((((HUGS))), Sherrie",

      "Content": "Mar 16, 2012 02:37AM - edited Mar 16, 2012 02:51AM by scuttlers This could be a hard decision.  For me, it would be a simple no, and here are the reasons. When I was first diagnosed, everyone at work knew.  And it sucked, because the entire dynamics of how I was treated changed.  I absolutely hated that every conversation, every passing in the hallway, every luncheon was interjected with the dreaded \"how are you?\", \"are you cured\", \"my aunt/neighbor/sister ...\", you all know the drill.  I just wanted to be me, doing me job.   I would question as to why is HR doing this.  What is the purpose?  What do they expect to accomplish.  And the simple fact that they say  \"This new project will have a video portion that will focus on people who have been put in difficult situations and yet have \"stayed the course\" so to speak and are doing ok now\", kind of makes me feel they don't understand MBC at all.  The other examples you give can be compartmentalized and left behind (although the emotional impact for life would be life altering).  MBC can not be left behind, so to say, it is here, it is here to stay.  One moment the entire situation can change and the beast can kill.  It is a constant.  It is NOT an adversary that was overcome, moved on, and now are OK.  Can MBC be explained in a few minutes of a video that has the purpose of showing you \"are doing OK now\"?   Would the reality of MBC be shown? Since that is not the purpose of the video, I would doubt that would be the message that they are trying to disseminate.   And if the reality of MBC is not going to be shown, then really what would be the purpose?  (It would be interesting to know what your company does, makes me wonder why they are doing this project?) We can compare to Pandora's Box.    When we moved back home to Idaho, I became very careful on who was given information regarding my condition.  NONE of my neighbors know.  Someday they will, not today.  Today I want the neighborhood to be blissfully unaware so I can enjoy the BBQ's and other gatherings without being the cancer girl.  My father is a long standing and very influential member of Rotary. He took me for several months, and wanted me to join.  Then one day, one of the women there who was friends with my Mom, let the cat out of the bag.  So each meeting someone who ask the dreaded questions.  It totally ruined the experience of being in a philantrophy group and being able to offer my talents as an intelligent, working, individual.  It sucked.   I agree that we need to get the word and knowledge out to the public on the realities of BC and especially the realities of MBC.  Would this project be able to do this?  They are probably aiming for showing you as a smiling, happy, functional, intelligent etc. individual who has not let MBC control your life.  Are they going to show what the reality is?  Probably NOT, because that is not the purpose of the project.   And on a personal note,  I agree with kschultz, \"when everyone in the office becomes aware of your situation, they you WILL be seen differently and treated differently\".

Right up front, all my team (medical) said to not worry about weight. Exercise is good. Of course, with the neuropathy I could not walk/run/zumba etc. So I tried swimming. It is working. I still eat my comfort food (ice cream), and refuse to deny myself the joys of living, which translates to eating what I want and not eating what I don't want.

We on the stage IV forum would move heaven and earth to have 18 years as your wife has had with treatments. We deal with the side effects because of the love and caring that fills our days. At some point each of us will decide if and when it is time for us to go. We will do it with grace and knowledge, without trying to grab a group to follow our path. We each have our own path to follow. We respect that. We are asking you to respect that. PLEASE!",

I have had nothing but problems with this drug.  I begged the oncologist to stop it and they ask me why would I consider stopping a drug that is keeping me alive.  The last two sets of scans show no evidence of progression and no evidence of disease.   (April and June; another set will be done in September). The Tykerb is worse than any of the sets of chemo I went through.  So tired, pain, nausea (vomiting in the AM), constant diarrhea, mouth sores, nasal sores, hair falling out, dizzy, vertigo, and basically a loss of will to do anything while taking the drug.  I truly feel that I can not live the rest of my life like that.  I stop it, and within 24 hours I feel better, no dizziness, no nausea, and I feel like smiling again.   Like I said, the doctors insist I continue the drug.  They tell me that if I don't the cancer will progress and it would be basically a miracle if I make it through the year.  (I feel that it is a miracle that I am showing NED at this stage!)  They tell me that if I continue it, my survival could well be up to 10 years or more.  But it is absolutely worse than any of the chemo infusions - I knew that I would feel better the next day or the next week on them.  With the Tykerb, I will never feel better.  The doctors also tell me that I should continue this drug until it stops working - so there is no end in sight. I took it for a week to start, stopped because of this.  Tried again at a lower dose for a couple of weeks, and stopped again.  This cycle has been on and off since February.   When I take the Tykerb, the side effects are immediate - the very next day.  As the days continue, the effects become more and more difficult to deal with and seem to escalate.  Each night, when taking this drug, I feel as if I am taking poison!  I stopped again last night, I couldn't bring myself to swallow the pills.  This morning - no dizziness, no headache, I feel like smiling, and my energy has returned.  Best of all my will to get up and \"live\" has returned.    Any ideas of how to handle the side effects?  Has anyone taken this for an extended period of time and had the symptoms start to even out or become more bearable?  My favorite side effect of treatments is BEING ALIVE!

My mom just asked me yesterday why on earth am I still going to MDA, why are you still having scans done, and WHY are you still having infusions and taking oral chemo. UGH!!!! Too many think there is actually a cure. I had no idea when I was diagnosed what the new normal would be. I actually thought OK, some chemo, surgery, chemo, and radiation and I'll be \"good to go\". Quite an education in the last 3 years. Time for the \"pink fluff\" to stop. Time for a CURE. Time for honesty.

Floating down denial river is gentle and comforting to many of us, I spend a lot of time on that boat. Then I face the realities, get busy with understanding that knowledge can give me power and face the fears headon. Currently had recent progression after 2+ years of NED. Scan showed cancer was moving up the right neck via the vascular system straight towards the head (that is where I keep my brain). We decided to jump on this with some big guns (which has been pure hell for the last 6 weeks, and I was ready to quit.). Scanned again, and showed \"complete metabolic response\" to the current chemo. Ok, so I guess it will be worth it to finish the next four cycles of this crap to stay in NED's arms for a possible couple more years. No symptoms, just a scan that showed the progression. Know your enemy, know where it is, know what it is doing. I would rathe have the 6 chemo sessions (which are truly difficult), than be fighting brain Metz, which is where this would have gone. All without symptoms.",

You do not have to wait until you have not worked for 4-5-6 months. I actually filed before I quit working and was approved within 10 days. Of course I still had my waiting period, but the checks were deposited automatically right on time. I drew my last full paycheck (using up my sick time accrued) in December of that year, STD check was deposited in January, SSDI was deposited in April, and LTD was deposited in May. Continue on the SSDI and LTD. I took FMLA and immediately filed all the applications. This gave me 12 weeks to get all approved and in motion. If there had been gliches, I could have returned to my position (which was protected by the FMLA). I was the only bread earner at that time and it was mandatory to have income without a break. As a side note, LTD sent me a letter about 6 weeks ago telling me that I would \"run out\" of benefits in the following year. I immediately sent them a letter with a full copy of my policy showing that my benefits DID NOT have a set time restriction. They called me the following week and apologized and sent an apology letter in the mail stating that my benefits did not have this expiration time. You really have to keep on top of these people and stand you ground and most important understand your policies.",

Call them directly, tell them you need a full copy of the policy (it may be available on line), and also you need the forms to file for Accelerated Benefits. (if the person you talk to doesn't know about Accelerated Benefits, don't worry, it will be detailed in the policy and that will be your guide). Do not lose this benefit. Most life insurance policies allow 50-80% pay out on accelerated benefits. Doctors form showing expected death within a certain period of time. (heck, you've had these expected outcomes several times in the last year - c diff etc.). The payout is NOT taxed, tax free. And usually once the payout is made, the insurance company will waive the future premiums and the remainder of the insurance will remain in effect until you actually die. As I said, this must be done before you are not an employee and before you lose the benefit.",

My dad is extremely happy with the care they provide. And I do see an oncology section on the informational mapping of the facility. Our income is around $3500 a month, so the $677 is taking a BIG chunk, and we also have $2500 out of pocket per year. Has anyone used the VA for treatments? Since I have (and will have for life) infusions every three weeks. I also take some VERY expensive oral chemo drugs daily. (My prescriptions average over $4000 a month, not including the infusions.). Our prescription coverage is great on the private insurance. Any information regarding VA would be helpful. Good or bad. Do we keep the private coverage? Etc.

Yes, I have a personal problem with stage 0 and stage 1 survivors who come into the world I am dealing with; and try to tell me how to deal with the issues I have to deal with.  This cuts close to home and deep into the bone - a very close and loved relative is a 10 year survivor, stage 0, 3 treatments of chemo, lumpectomy - and is very pushing in letting me know that if I \"get my spirit right with the Lord\", if I \"pray right\",  and so much more - that I will be totally healed.  Even to the point of letting me know that I must STOP taking the medications and infusions to show my trust in the Lord for healing.   So, it hit a nerve this morning to see a stage 1 sister wanting to take away what I felt was a legitimate request for survey information that may someday make a difference to the sisters who will be following us on this horrid pathway.   Again, I apologize if you felt I was yelling.  (And I apologized to the poor clerk in Lowe's who I did kind of yell at today for total stupidity and ignorance.  I do have a short fuse this weekend.) ",

Some months I have a minor headache for the whole month, start a new bottle and no headache. I have shared this with the Tykerb pharmacist and I get the feeling that they think I am crazy. Thanks to all the gals that got me settled into being able to tolerate this drug! Even the oncologist at MDA is wonderfully surprised at the lack of progression and my continued affair with NED. Thinking back to when they told me that I only could wish for weeks, maybe a couple of months - TWO YEARS ago! It was worth it to keep trying to tolerate this drug, THANKS to BCO girls for getting me through!",

I get really tired if visiting that room every 3 weeks, and taking the Tykerb really sucks; but I am thankful to be alive and feel QOL is tolerable.

I filed FMLA with the Oncologist stating that I could work 4 hours per week. (this gave me a full paycheck for the 12 weeks FMLA and used up my accumulated sick time.). Then the same week I filed the SSDI, STD, and the LTD. The SSDI was approved within 2 weeks which started my waiting period immediately. The STD was approved and started payment the week my full checks were done. The LTD Insurance called and \"verified\" that I was still employed when the papers were filed and those payments started the week my STD was finished.

Can you explain how the cancer can turn into IDC (inter ductal cancer) when all the breast tissue is gone including the ducts? I am asking because one of my care team was trying to tell me that I no longer had IBC, but it was now IDC. He told me that IBC was a \"clinical diagnosis\" and was not actually a cancer. (He really pressed me off.) Yours is the first comment I've seen (other than that doctors opinion) and I am hoping you can explain this to me.

Be SURE you stay at the Rotary House if at all possible (get your reservation in early) as it is so much easier.  I usually stay there, but they were full when I had my surgery so had to stay close by, but it was not near as easy for us.   Enjoy your weekend!  Sherrie ",

He would put straws in them to make it easy to drink. And replace them every hour or so. (some were wasted, but some were drank which was the goal). It put in fluids which forced me to get up for the restroom. As soon as I moved for that, he had warm wet washcloths to wipe me down, and clean underwear and clean shift to put on.

It is important to check these supplemental plans for coverage that you need PRIOR to signing up with them. There is a page on the Medicare.Gov site where you can put in your zip code to find the plans available in your area. Then you need to input your drugs to see if they are covered and HOW they are covered. (I have also put in ANY and ALL drugs that may be possibly prescribed in the future to see how they are covered.) and VERY IMPORTANT, check with all your healthcare providers to see if they will continue to see you if you sign with a specific plan. (DO NOT believe the company, check directly with the healthcare provider!) YES, I agree, this is absolutely the last thing we should be spending our energies on. We have enough to worry about without this crap. But unfortunately, it is necessary to cover our own bases before making the decision of how to cover our medical expenses as we move into Medicare. I do not know which/what you are using as your supplemental. I am hoping my DH's insurance will be accepted as my secondary (I go on Medicare in September). I do know that GSK has a great program, Tykerb Cares, that helps with the cost. (for me, they dropped my co-pay to $25 per month). I am really hopeful for you that the providers for Xeloda will have a similar program. Tykerb is also provided through the specialty pharmacy. They did require all that information before putting me on the schedule for shipments. My co-pay in July was OVER $2,700, the care program was not retroactive. So please get it in place before setting up shipment. Just found out my insurance Cobra's (primary and secondary) are now very close to $1,400 PER MONTH! (will move to Medicare in Sept.). Not sure how we are going to do this until then. Anyone know of any foundations that help with Cobra?",

And when I least expect it, the storms come back. It is always dark, I don't see them coming. DH cries out for me, and for a minutes I can be in his arms and feel safe. But then the storm pushes his raft further away. I want to stay with him. Sometimes there are others there, my grand babies, my daughters. My loved ones. They don't know how to keep me in the raft. There is a rope with a huge anchor that always pulls me out of their arms and back into the hostile sea. Alone and crying. Each time I am dragged back into the sea - I vomit, I'm cold, the unseen creatures keep eating my hair off, and scaring my body. I am bloated. The pain is always there. And I get more and more tired of trying to swim and stay afloat. But I know that just over the next wave DH will see me again and pull me in and I'll feel safe and warm and loved for a little while longer.

BUT - - - There are a couple of very weird things going on... First:  I had a loud \"hissing\" noise in my left ear for about a second and totally lost hearing in that ear.  The hearing loss lasted for almost a week, and about 24 hours after my Herceptin infusion - it suddenly came back.  (No fever, so I don't think it was an infection.) Second:  Twice, I have been driving somewhere and suddenly realize that I am lost.  The first time I was coming home from work, suddenly realized that I did not have a clue as to where I was or how to get home from there.  Thank goodness I have Navigator on my Blackberry!  Today I was headed to one of the clinical sites, and realized that I was about 5 miles from where I was supposed to be headed and going in the wrong direction.  Kind of scared to drive alone now.   Of course, I have a Garmin - - - it was on the kitchen counter.  It will be in the car from now on and programmed before I leave the driveway!  As a side note:  I found the \"voice\" on the Garmin to be totally irritating - my DH reprogrammed it to a \"Scottish\" accent - oh my it is so sweet now! Are these episodes common with the Tykerb or should I be hollerin' for my oncologist???? ",
