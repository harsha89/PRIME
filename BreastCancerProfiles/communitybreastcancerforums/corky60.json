I just finished 19/33 and have been using Avalon Organics Unscented Aloe Hand and Body Lotion on the skin in the dressing room right after treatment.  When I get home (and again at bedtime) I smear Eucerin cream on the skin.  It's very thick and white so can smear on good and thick.  So far there's barely any redness but the nipple is very sore. I began to have some skin roughness in the crease and the nurse suggested to use Lotrimin cream there.  It has helped to smooth the skin quite a bit.  She also suggested using a lighter lotion, not the Eucerin cream, in order to let the skin \"breathe\".  But when I did that some red patches appeared.  So back to the Eucerin cream and the red has faded quite a bit.  Not sleeping well probably due to anxiety.  The machine broke as I was on the treatment table.  There I was with my feet strapped to the table, calling and calling the tech.  She of course knew the machine was broken but couldn't hear me because the speaker was blocked.  Finally they moved me to another machine.  Sheesh.",

My PCP says that the atrophy is responsible for the pelvic pain and UTIs but she can't prescribe Vagifem due to my ER+ status. Instead she referred me to a urologist, a gyn and a pain center. I told her that my pain is often a 7 out of 10 and she recommended Tylenol. I've been at this level of pain for months with no relief. She will not prescribe opioids. I go to the pain center in a couple of days after a month wait. The paperwork for the center includes an Opioid Treatment Agreement. I will have to sign a contract with them that says I agree to random drug screening tests and periodic random pill counts. I will not sell the medication or ask for early refills. And so on and so forth. It used to be that a person's family doctor was able to treat severe pain. The pendulum has swung so far to the other side that those like myself can't get pain relief when we need it. Instead we're made to wait for weeks and weeks to go to a pain center. Our suffering is being ignored until the system can fit us into its schedule. And then we're being treated as addicts or potential addicts. This is the new reality.",
