Don't know if it's the right place to post it or not, I've got very sharp pain on my left breast especially in the nipple ( please note my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer and that started in nipple). Went to GP and they referred me to breast clinic where mammogram and ultrasound were done and all cane clear. I am very worried coz I still have pain. Can anyone advice me if they are experiencing same? Thanks in advance Log in to post a reply",
