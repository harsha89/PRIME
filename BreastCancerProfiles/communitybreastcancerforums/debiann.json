Many travel to here for top notch, innovative options in breast reconstruction. Not me personally, but I've seen many on here refer to it. Their website, however, is a good resouce for anyone considering flap reconstruction because it gives good explanations of what the options are and include before/after photos. I had my recon done locally, would not have been able to afford travel costs, but I'm happy with the results",

The neulasta or neupogen is a shot you get 24-48 hours after chemo to help boost your white blood count. At my center they offered it on the arm or the belly.

When you know the particular characteristics of your tumor you will be able to join up with others on this forum in a similar situation. Things do get easier when you have a treatment plan in place. In the meantime, Dr. Google is NOT your friend. Lots of the information you find online is inaccurate, outdated, or does not apply to your specific case. While we all need to empower ourselves with knowledge, be very careful about the source and date of what you read. Another important thing to remember when scrolling through this forum is that many, many, many members join for just a short time, while they are in treatment. They go on to happily live their lives without recurrence or problems and don't post anymore. Some of us stick around cause we get hooked, but don't have additional issues. Unfortunately, some are here because of a recurrence or troubling side effect. They are the ones that will stick out most to you and you will begin to think that this happens to everyone. It doesn't.

However, location is also important because when your feeling like crap and need to see the doc or need some extra fluids at the infusion center, you won't want to be traveling hours to get there. I'm sure there is a standard protocal of chemo for your dx. and most MO's are going to offer you that. What are others on this board with dx similar to you getting? That is likely what you will get and if not ask why. While you don't want to make a hasty choice, you can't take too long to decide either. I only met with one MO. I liked his personality, he was offering me the same treatment others on here were getting and his office and the infusion center were conveniently located. Once chemo is over, if you don't like your MO's approach to follow up care and scans, you can search for a new one at that time. Did NOLA say why they wanted chemo first? Did they think chemo would compromise the recon? Do they want the size of the tumor reduced before surgery? Or does it have more to do with timing, perhaps they want you receiving some type of treatment now to stop its growth, realizing its going to take time to schedule surgery. Good luck to you. I know you are really researching your options and going into this as informed as you can be. These decisions are so difficult to make and as hard as we search, there just is no \"right\" answer.",

You will likely  get bloodwork 2 days before chemo, which can be done at a lab close to home. Usually your mo wants to see you the day before or the day of chemo. 24 hours after chemo you get a neulasta shot at the infusion center. I know of some who lived far and had this shot mailed to their home and self administered. Chemo times can vary based on what your getting and how things are done at your center. I was usually there about 3 hours, although expect the first time to be longer. I had issues with dehydration and needed extra fluids on day 4 following every tx, so that was another trip back to the infusion center, plus I had other concerns like oral thrush and had to be seen by the MO between treatments. I spent more time at my center than I expected to. Fortunately it was less than 30 minutes from my house, which was particularly appreciated after tx when I just wanted to get home to bed. Perhaps if your MO is farther away you can see your family doctor if anything arises between tx.  With an MX, getting clean margins near your chest wall is important or they are going to recommend rads too. So if they looked at the location of your tumor and recommended chemo first then its probably a good idea.",

Trvler, It seems like you are on your own finding doctors. Is that your choice because you wanted second opinions or didn't the facility that gave you the dx refer you to anyone? For me, from the time my mammo came back questionable, everything was laid out for me, from biopsy, to BS, to MO, to PS, I was referred to who I should see. The appointments were even made for me and I was sent a calendar and scripts for blood work and scans that I needed. I was assigned a nurse navigator who I could contact if I had questions, plus she arranged things I asked for like genetic counseling, a nutritionist, and a mastectomy class. My MO also had me meet with his nurse for about an hour to answer all my questions . I think I called her with concerns after every treatment. She was wonderful!. For the post part, I liked who I was referred to and stayed with them, except for the PS. The one I was referred to was nice enough, but he did not do DIEP, but another in the same practice did. When first dx I contemplated going to a bigger cancer center in Philadelphia, which would have been about a 2 hour drive for me, but then I decided the cancer center close to my home had a very good reputation and because I was early stage, the treatment would be the same wherever I went. When it came to reconstruction, I again wondered if I should go into Phila, but I then I met the one and only PS doing DIEP in my area, and although he is young and has less experience, he came highly recommended and I felt good with him.",

The day of my first appointment, I was actually his ONLY patient, lol, we talked for over 2 hours. Of course he now has more patients, but I never feel like he is hurrying me through an appointment.

I had completed chemo just a few weeks before surgery, so I think that made it more difficult. I also got a condition called drop foot, which was caused by nerve damage from the surgical compression boots. I needed a couple months of PT to walk right. Drains suck. Definitely the worst part of the whole ordeal. You need to think about what you will wear to hold the drains. I had a pouch that went around my neck to hold them in the shower. Other times I wore a housecoat with big pockets inside-out and put the drains in the pockets. The tummy incision didn't bother me as much as I thought, except it's pulled so tight you walk kind of hunched over for awhile till things stretch out. The breasts might be numb, but there's still pain from swelling. The first week you can't reach up or down for anything. Make sure anything you will need is at counter height. Constipation is a worry, have stool softener on hand. I am almost two years out. For the most part all is well. I had two revision surgeries to get the size and shape right. I'm getting nipples next month. The appearance is wonderful, but I'm still very numb in the tummy area. I dislike that very much. The breasts have regained more sensation than I expected. The left breast gives me no issues. The right breast however still tends to swell at times and can be very uncomfortable. It's like somebody screwed it on too tight. The surgeon said sometimes this happens and it may always be this way. If you have any questions just ask. There are no dumb questions and you will get lots of support on this forum. Good luck.",

From what I read prior to meeting my MO, the same tx was going to be recommended to me wherever I went: surgery, chemo, and maybe rads depending on node status and weather I chose lx or mx. So I felt comfortable skipping the second opinion. With even a small Her2+ tumor, I think chemo with herceptin is going to be recommended no matter where you go. It will basically be your choice if you want to do it. Herceptin is very effective. Neo-adjuctive (before surgery) chemo with an addition of perjeta is now being offered for Her2+, but I think your tumor is too small. But if you wanted to look into this it would be a reason to seek a second opinion before surgery. When it comes to surgery you will be given two options, lumpectomy with rads OR mastectomy and possibly no rads needed (if node negative and tumor not located near the chest wall). Some people fear rads others say its a breeze.  Anywhere you go you are going to be told the same thing, ultimately your chance for survival is the same with either option. In the end it's your choice to make. Its a very personal decision and if you go searching for the \"right\" answer you will be truly disappointed, because it does not exist. Both options have pros and cons and neither guarantee you will not have a recurrance. It is impossible to remove all breast tissue, even with an mx. There are many threads on here that discuss topic. Many work through chemo, others can't, you won't know which one you are till you try it. I rarely miss work. I took off only a week for a hysterectomy, so everyone was very surprised at how chemo kicked my butt and I did miss alot, and couldn't really function as myself when I was there. You may want to look into short term disability options and medicare/medicaid/obamacare or whatever insurance help may be available to you to get through this. Its just for a few months.

Here are some things to consider: reconstruction is a process, it takes awhile till you see the final results There are different types of abdominal flaps, TRAM, Free TRAM, DIEP. TRAM removes the most ab muscle.  Free TRAM takes a small amount of muscle, DIEP no muscle. Talk with your PS, not all  do Free TRAM or DIEP.  Understand you don't always get what you want. Flaps can fail and you then have to choose between implants or flat. In my case, there were complications and my DIEP turned into a free tram. If you are athletic you may notice ab weakness that interferes with your activities.  Cosmetically the tummy tuck can be great, but some are not pleased with the results noting problems like \"swelly belly\" and \"the ken doll effect\" (swelling in the pubic area). There is loss of sensation in both the breast and tummy area. As nerves regrow, some sensation returns, it is different for everyone.  Overall I am happy with my decision, but I hit some low points along the way because recon happens in stages, so getting to the end takes time. I'm happy with the cosmetic results, but sometimes the loss of sensation, particularly in my tummy area, upsets me. I was expecting this to happen to the breasts, but there is a wide area around my belly button that is still numb. I'm 8 months out from surgery and hoping that will change in time. Good luck to you.",

They will work together during surgery. If you need any revision work afterwards for dog ears or some fat grating to fill in the divots you will follow up with the PS. My PS was great and was all on board for giving me a nice flat finish, but then I changed my mind and did DIEP recon instead. Totally my choice, he didn't push me at all. The discussions about what the end product would be like were with the PS only. The breast surgeon's job was just to remove the breasts. I think a PS has the skills to do flat right. Perhaps the BS doesn't?",

We all search Dr. GOOGLE when we had symptoms, but you are not going to find any answers there that will definitively tell you if you have breast cancer. A doctor cannot even tell you that just by examing you. There are many benign, harmless reasons that women can have a breast lump. That does not mean it should be ignored. An ultrasound will give you more information, and if there is still a concern they will do a biopsy. Many women get biopsies only to find out the lump is benign.  Generally, breast cancer does not hurt, but on occassion, if it is touching a nerve there can be some pain. Most would say excruciating pain is not cancer, but of course anything is possible so it needs to be checked.  Breast cancer generally would not stop the nipple from being able to become erect.  When is your ultrasound appointment? Hopefully it is soon. Until then, try not to worry. The lump is what is is, all the worrying in the world won't change it into something else. There is a very good chance that it is either benign or an infection. If it is cancer, there are many treatments available. Try to stay positive till you know more. Prayers for you.",

Its easy to do, most of us are planners and understand how badly you just want to fit this all into your schedule, but unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. If you learn any one lesson from this mess it is that nothing is predictable and you need to go with the flow. Taller than wide is not a good description and neither is a birad 5. You likely have cancer, but there is always a chance you don't. Its one of those situations where you have pray for the best but expect the worst. If you do have cancer, chemo may be necessary, but if you are ER+ with no node involvement and HER2- you may not. Depending on node involvement and the type of surgery you select, you may or may not need rads. At this point there are two many scenarios to even begin to predict what your treatment plan may be. A lumpectomy with radiation and an anti-hormonal pill would require minimal time off work while a mastectomy with reconstruction and chemo would need more. You will likely have choices to make regarding surgery. Lumpectomy always need radiation, but sometimes by getting a mastectomy you can skip radiation. That's what appealed to me. Of course no reconstruction is a much faster recovery time. Reconstruction, whether with implants or flap surgery (using your own fat to create new breast mounds), often requires more than one surgery. Chemo is really up in the air. Some people do really well and work right through chemo, or others, like me, can't get off the couch for 2 out of the 3 weeks in a cycle. Many get by with working from home or reducing hours. It sounds like you have a great job. Whatever amount of time off you need off from work, within a few months you'll be back to feeling like yourself and doing your job as efficiently and ever. You really need to impress that upon your employer. This is a temporary state, it will pass. There is no need to go through the expense and trouble of replacing you. However, perhaps if it helps you, you may be able to find someone to train to help out temporarily if needed. Good luck to you.",

Be aware however, that the surgeons aren't too quick to recognize that their surgery caused lymphedema, post mastectomy pain syndrome, or any other problem. I couldn't even get an appointment to see my breast surgeon because her nurse determined, over the phone, that I did not have lymphedema or any other problem they needed to see me for. Check out the lymphedema threads and you will see that most report their surgeon did not take them seriously at the onset. We are told that if only a few lymph nodes are removed we can't get lymphedema, which is totally not true, any surgery, even without the removal of lymph nodes, can change the path of fluid drainage and cause a problem.

My PS recommended Neosporin on the incisions, but there is some controversy on this, so ask first. I healed quickly and my scars aren't too bad so I think the Neosporin really helps. There are lots of ways to hold the drains, plan on using something. I wore a housecoat with large patch pockets inside out and I placed the drains in the pockets. In the shower I used a pouch that hung from my neck. You have to measure, record and empty the fluid in the drains a few times a day. I found it easiest to keep an empty jar by the bed which the DH would then empty for me. DRAINS SUCK, 'nuff said. I found a shower chair to be useful. Some like sleeping in a recliner, I preferred lots of pillows on the bed to make a little nest. If your having DIEP you are unable to lie flat, you need to stay kind of curved till the tummy skin stretches. You will walk like a gorilla for the first couple of weeks. If you are going to be alone, prepare your house in advance by having everything counter height and within easy reach. Reaching up for a glass, or down for a carton of milk in the fridge is difficult. Good luck to everyone awaiting surgery. ",

It in itself is a powerful treatment. Many stage IV start with the antihormonal and remain stable or NED for years. If it stops working and there is progression, then they move onto chemo. You could approach your TX like that and hold off on the chemo for if/when you know you really need it. Of course that would likely mean metastic cancer. Btw, what grade tumor? Chemo works best on the faster dividing, higher grade cells. I was truly considering skipping chemo myself till I found out I was Her2+. I did 6 rounds of Taxotere and Carboplatin and a year of herceptin. Chemo sucked, but I don't have much in the way of lingering side effects so I'm able to gradually put it behind me.

      "Content": "Jun 29, 2017 08:00AM - edited Jun 29, 2017 08:02AM by debiann While the tumor they removed was small, the purpose of radiation or mx is to prevent a local recurrance caused by any microscopic cancer cells left in the breast. You are correct, both radiation and mx are scary, aggressive treatments. Is further treatment absolutely necessary? No one knows. Many need the additional treatment for peace of mind, to know \"I did everything I could\". Others are comfortable with the wait and see approach, reasoning that if the cancer returns they will deal with it then. That choice, however, does increase the risk of any leftover cancer cells multiplying and leaving the breast to grow in another organ, which would then be metastic breast cancer, which is not curable. There are pros and cons to both types of treatment. Some people sail through radiation, others have problems with healing or other health issues that present years later caused by the radiation. Mx can be a simple surgery or more complex, depending upon if you do reconstruction and what type of recon you have. Again, some sail through while others have problems with healing. My personal choice was to avoid radiation. The location of my tumor meant radiation was going to be close to my heart. I did a double mx with immediate DIEP recon (tummy tissue was used to make new breasts). I also had three revision surgeries to get the shape right and add areolas and nipples. I am very pleased with my decision. I no longer need routine mammograms. At the three year mark I had a breast MRI and all is clear. The decisions are the hardest part. Keep reading, do your research and eventually the path that feels right for you will become clear. Good luck to you.",

Search this website and you will find threads dedicated to both procedures, both the pros and the cons. I chose bmx because it allowed me to skip radiation. For me, radiation was only going to allow me to save my breast, not my life. I could avoid radiating near my heart and lungs by simply removing the affected breast. I was not that emotionally attached to my breasts. I had them both removed because I knew I would worry about bc in the opposite breast if I kept it. I don't miss them. I did reconstruct with DIEP. The cosmetic results are great, but it took a few revisions to get to where I'm at. In hindsight, I think I could have been just as happy going flat. But that's my story... we all have different perspectives, circumstances and reasons for choosing one option over the other. It's good we have options. There is no \"right\" choice, just the choice that fits you best. I feel that our doctors don't spend enough time discussing the potential risks and outcomes for either procedure, so its good you are reaching out to others to hear their stories. Eventually, your gut will tell you what is the right path for you, the path that you fear the least. Good luck.",

Knowing your risk for developing a new cancer may help you decide. Have you met with a plastic surgeon to understand your recon options? You don't need to have made up your mind about a mastectomy to consult with a PS. There are implants of couse, but also flaps where skin and fat is taken from one area of your body to make new breast mounds. Even if you want to go flat, a plastic surgeon can help give you a good cosmetic result. If you are node negative and the tumor is not near the chest wall, having a mastectomy could mean you will not need to have radiation. People have very personal reasons for choosing lx or mx. Some can't bear the thought of losing a breast while others can't imagine keeping their breasts after having cancer. Some don\u2019t want to endure the longer recovery of an mx or have no support sustem to help them after surgery. Some fear surgery while others really hope to avoid radiation. Unless your medical team is advising one option over another, it comes down to what feels \"right\" for you and what option will best help you emotionally move on past cancer. My personal story was lumpectomy first, with close margins so following chemo I needed either another lx or mx. Because I was node negative I knew I would likely not need radiation if I had a mastectomy. My cancer was on my left side and rads would be close to my heart, so skipping rads appealed to me. I also knew that keeping my breasts would cause me a lot of worry. I chose to do DIEP recon, which means my tummy fat was used to make my new breasts. I had three revision surgeries to complete the recon and create new areolas and nipples. I am pleased with the results and my natural feeling breasts. Good luck to you. As you do your research and listen to other's stories, you will start to lean toward the option that feels right for you.",

Above is a link to an explanation of cancer of an unknown primary source, perhaps it will help you. I don't think it is uncommon for cancer to be found \"accidentally\" while scanning for another problem. A friend fell off a ladder and needed a chest x-ray and lung cancer was discovered. My mom had an ultrasound for a back problem and very early stage uterine pre-cancer was found. Initially, I think most of us feel worse from the treatment than we did from the cancer. Many of us had no idea we had cancer, but you certainly know when you've had chemo. I hope you get answers soon. (((Hugs to you)))",

I found sucking on mints for dry mouth (Xylimelts or other brands) with the ingredient xylitol helped prevent the thrush from recurring. Xylitol is supposed to fix the PH level in your mouth so thrush can't grow. I also gargled with Biotene. Probiotics seem to melt the thrush away. You can eat some yogurt and let it linger in your mouth, its very soothing, or suck on a probiotic tablet. Also, sugar really makes the thrush grow fast, so avoid sodas and sugary snack.

I only had an issue with my left and had a bmx for two reasons, first to eliminate frequent scans and worry on the non-cancer side. Second, for symmetry. My breasts may look different than they did originally (actually better, the originals were saggy), but at least they look the same. Of course the reconstructed nipples have no sensation, but if you do a lift they move your nipple, so you may lose sensation anyway. What kind of reconstruction are you considering? If you are doing some type of flap, like DIEP, you will need to know for sure 1 breast or 2, because they can't go back and harvest more tissue from the same area if you want the other one done down the road. In that case they would need to use another area of your body, which would be a lot of surgeries. If keeping one natural breast is really important to you then a lumpectomy on one side is a good solution. Ask if your lumpectomy is likely to deform the breast at all. I'd do it the doctor's way if you are reconstructing with implants. Worry about the second mx when and if it is necessary. But if you are reconstructing with a flap, I'd want the lumpectomy first to know for sure how many mounds need to be made, 1 or 2. Good luck to you.",

Insist on some type of screening, a mammogram, ultrasound, or mri . Get a second opinion if necessary. Keep in mind you may  just have an infection or a swollen lymph node. This would be the much more common explanation for someone your age. My husband just went through something similiar with a lump near his nipple. They did a mammogram (don't ask me how, he has tiny man boobs) and a course of antibiotics and the lump disappearred.  Waiting till monday should be fine, unless you start to show symptoms of a serious infection such as running a fever or the breast becomes red, inflamed, or hot. Do you have walk in centers where you live? Not hospital emergency rooms, but doctors offices  that are open weekends for minor emergencies? In our area, the cost of an emergi-center visit is similar to a regular doctor visit. This may give you peace of mind if you are very worried and they can start antibiotics if necessary.",

The reason for this is that the mx prevents a local or new cancer in the breast only. The purpose of chemo is to kill any cancer cell that have left the breast and are traveling around your body (distant recurrance). It is hoped that the chemo will prevent the cancer from metastasizing in your bones, liver, lungs or brain (the areas bc usually spreads to.)

But breast cancer can spread through the lymph or vascular systems (metastisize)and set up home elsewhere in the body, usually bone, liver, lung or brain. When bc is detected early, there is less of a chance it has spread, but even small, node negative cancers can metastasize, so you and your medical team will be more vigilant for years.   Her 2 + is considered a more aggressive cancer, but there are also some very effective targeted treatments (herceptin and perjeta) specifically for this type of cancer. You will be offered chemo to kill off any rouge cancer cells that have already left the breast and are elsewhere in your body. See an oncologist or ask your team about neo-adjunctive chemo BEFORE surgery. This is the latest protocol for Her2+ cancer (TCPH), and you get both herceptin and perjeta.  Down the road you will also be offered some type of antihormone therapy, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. This reduces the estrogen in your body that fuels the cancer. Statisticslly, having a lumpectomy (lx) or a mastectomy (mx) has no effect on if you survive breast cancer. Cancer in your breast doesn't kill you, its when it leaves the breast and spreads to your other organs that it is dangerous. Both lx and mx will remove the cancer that is currently in your breast and then you hope, pray, and cross all your fingers and toes that it never shows up outside the breast. If you have a lx you will also need radiation. If you have a mx you could possibly avoid rads. Mx does offer some additional protection against having a local recurrance of cancer in the breast or from having a new breast cancer grow. Since it is impossible to remove all breast cells, even with mx, cancer can recur in the chest area, along a scar, or in a lymph node. Good luck to you. Glad you found this forum, it offers lots of info and support.",

I did reconstruct and I had small dog ears, like pointy tips, at the ends of my incisions. During revision these were smoothed out, but I still had a lot of side boob fat. I just had nipple recon and the side boob area was liposuction, leaving a much nicer appearance. If you are \"plump\" like me, it does make the situation worse because where ever they end their surgery the area next to it is fat. My first PS was less compassionate about the side boob fat bulges and the love handles on my hips that were terribly obvious after the diep tummy tuck. Fortunetly for me, that surgeon moved and I had to see a new PS for the nipple recon. He was much more generous with the lipo fixing both the side boob and the love handles. If you are unhappy with your results, second opinions can't hurt. I think for the best cosmetic effect it is not unreasonable to expect there may need to be more than one surgery, even if you are going flat. If the skin is drawn too tight the first time it can cause problems, as others have mentioned.",

If I had needed to use two donor sites I think I would have done uni. My tummy has been left rather numb, I wouldn't want that in another place too. I am happy with the cosmetic results. The breasts look and feel natural and I have regained some sensation in the breasts. My breasts and tummy are about equally numb, which is a downside. Miss being able to feel kisses or strokes to these areas the way they used to feel. If symmetry is an issue for you, I do think that flap recon can better match a natural breast that implant, however that is only my opinion, you would need to consult your surgeon about that. If you do a uni they can give your natural side a lift, however that requires messing with the nipple and then you lose sensation anyway. Also, after any surgery you run the risk of lumps from fat necrosis, which are totally benign, just worrisome and may need scanning to identify. I've had lumps checked twice that turned out to be fat necrosis. I think finding these lumps in a natural breast would have caused me a lot more worry. I don't know much about the latissmus recon, but I believe it involves moving a muscle from the back to the front? I would want to talk to others to see how this affected them afterwards. I know my tummy will never be the same and they only took a tiny piece of muscle (although diep is not supposed to use muscle, sometimes it is necessary for them to use a postage size piece of muscle). If you are only doing one, a DIEP is probably better than latissmus. If you want to do the other one at a future date, they can then use another donor site. That was what my PS recommended when I considered the uni. I don't know much about the risk of recurrence with having the mutation, but I do know that it is nice to not need mammograms anymore. I will be getting a breast mri at three years out. My MO and PS were ok with uni, my BS leaned toward BMX. Good luck to you in your upcoming surgery.",

That's why your doctor is recommending chemo, to destroy any escaped cells before they grow in another part of your body. If you are not ER+ then there are no other systemic treatments for you, so chemo is a good option. Mastectomy and radiation only prevent local recurrance,  not distant mets. Four rounds of chemo isn't so bad. Not a picnic, of course, but a lot better than 6, which is what many of use get. Chemo is cumulative, getting a little worse each round, but you start to feel better a couple weeks after finished. Good luck to you. ",

The risk of recurrance with either choice is low. I had a lumpectomy first but got close margins. I could have gone with a second lumpectomy, but chose instead double mx with DIEP recon. I was starting to worry about what other surprises could be hiding in my breasts. I also preferred surgery over radiation. I got wonderful results, but its a long surgery.Mine was 13 hours. However I read that the biggest risk during surgery is when you are first going under and when they are waking you up, the time asleep is not the risky time. Don't know if that's true, but it eased my mind.  There is not a good choice, frankly they all suck. You need to pick the one that suits you best. Driving to radation daily can be difficult, especially if you live far away, plus you do get fatigued and maybe skin burns, so there is some recovery time. The plus is you save your breast and that is very important to some. Not so important to me. They betrayed me so I was ready to have them off. I think you could probably consider the surgical risk of lump vs. MX to be equal. Focus more on how you will feel about losing your breast. Btw, sometimes you can have a mx AND still need rads if the tumor was close to the chest wall or if lymph nodes are positive.",

The breast surgeon recommended starting with an lx just to learn more about the tumor's pathology and node status and I could go back for an mx later if thats what I wanted.. She told me that it is the law that bc patients can at anytime ask for an mx and insurance must pay for it. I had one close margin from the lx, but the nodes were clear. Going into chemo I knew that I was facing another surgery, either another lx with rads or an mx with no rads. During chemo I researched my options and sought a second opinion with a PS. I decided on BMX with DIEP recon. By this time my husband was on board with the decision because chemo was hell and I wanted no more breasts and no radiation. I'm pleased with the results, but I do have a little additional scarring from the lx. On the other hand, I was never informed about DIEP recon from my first PS, so had I of done an MX first I'd probably be sitting here with implants and not near as happy with the results.

Chemo, on the other hand, is to prevent a distant recurrence (metastasis) somewhere else in the body. Unfortunately, if radiation has been recommended, doing chemo does not change that, you just get to do both. The only way out of rads may be by having an MX, however if there are positive nodes or the tumor is close to the chest wall, rads may still be recommended. There are threads on here discussing this topic. Many women report that rads are easy, some report problems with skin or other long term side effects. There are quite a few women who choose to have an MX to avoid rads. Its a very personal decision, there is no \"right\" answer, no easy way out, no option that doesn't come with its own particular risks or side effects. It is important that in the end, you make the final decision, that you choose the option you can live with.",

Also, ask your BS in advance what kind of bandaging, pads, creams or meds you will need in advance so you don't need to go shopping after surgery. I had reconstruction, so my needs may have been different. I went through 2 boxes of 4 inch guaze pads and a large tube of neosporin. Some docs prefer bactrim, some don't want you to use antibiotic cream at all, so you need to ask. The pain meds made me constipated, so I needed stool softener and I switched to ibuprofen. I was allowed to use mederma cream for scars as soon as the incisions healed. Most important, think about your daily routine and put things you will need easily within reach. Wishing you well ",
