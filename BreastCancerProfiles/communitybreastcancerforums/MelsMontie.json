I have every symptom plus some....  Do I waste time with my OB/GYN or go straight to my oncologist?  I can't tell my best friend. She just lost her dad to Lung cancer.  We have been BFF for almost 30 years. I am not saying anything to my husband until I know.",

My birth Mom had colon cancer, so I have had my colonoscopies done, as well as upper GED.. EGD?  upper scope.      Sorry so late in responding.  I saw a new OB/GYN on Monday.  I hate seeing new ones, and thought I wouldn't like the guy, but, in all honesty.. I will continue to see him.  He did a biopsy from inside my uterus... now waiting on results.  They also did an endoscopic ultrasound of my uterus.  They did it before he saw me.  My oncologist had sent them a note.... He didn't mention the ultrasound, and I was so tired of waiting around the office all day, I didn't even bother to ask.  It kind of came back to me after I left, what he had said.  That he would call me as soon as the results came back, and to set up an appointment on the 19th... I'm thinking, if the biopsy was ok, there would be no need to go back on the 19th.  So they probably did see something, but I am glad he didn't go into the \"could be\" scenarios.  Of course, he will call  on Friday... my birthday....  sigh.     I bled a lot on Monday after the biopsy.  It slowed down for a bit, but it is back, and it feels like it did back in my earlier days, like a water balloon just waiting to pop.   If the holidays aren't stressful enough... let's add on waiting to hear about possible cancer.  My emotions have been all over the map today... angry, wanting to cry, wishing I could talk to my Mom (who passed away 31 years ago), wishing my youngest daughter didn't live across the country.  I texted her pictures of her horse and got no response.  I posted video of him on FB, and got no reply from her... I miss her so much.  I was dancing around the kitchen this morning...  If I had the energy to hit something... I might.  I'm scared, my husband is scared, my best friend is sick, and hasn't called...  ending the pity party... sorry.",

Thank You for a good birthday tomorrow.  I have cried all day... so glad I can stop that now.  Now, to bundle up, go clean stalls, and let my horses up.  They will be getting big relief hugs.",

They pulled blood, (not from my portacath, because it refused to give) and all the blood work came back normal. Tumor markers were good.  They gave me a CT that day.  Nothing appears on it.  I have already seen my urologist, and it isn't coming from that \"system\".  My husband was frustrated with me over weight loss and lack of appetite for any food, asked me why I thought I had such a problem.  I asked him if he really wanted to go down that road, and when he did, I told him my thoughts.  I had an Endoscopic Ultrasound and biopsied on my stomach.  I was told I would have the results in 4 working days.  I have never been so frustrated getting results.  One person who answered, said she would pass the message on.  Anyway, finally had my husband and Oncologist call the a-hole... and within minutes, he finally called me back, 3 days after my results were due.  Everything he biopsied came back clear.  So, my oncologist is trying to get me an appointment with another OB/GYN closer to home.  Hopefully quickly.  What \"was\" spotting, has now turned into bleeding.  I haven't had a period since my first chemo in October 2009.  My pelvis tenderness is all time high.  I have lost 30 pounds per my oncologist, who having been told by the nurse I was seeing,  about me, she came and talked to me.   I have blurry vision frequently.  Besides being so concerned about my current health, I am terrified of what insurance companies are going to do.  If they have a $13,000.oo deductible, I might as well just plan my funeral.  Every year, $13,000.oo deductible... but that is something I just have to let go of.  I am so distraught about it all, I am not getting anything accomplished.  Binge TV watching... mindless games on my ipad.  Trying not to think.  Waiting impatiently for my appointment with an OB/GYN, preferably before the new year, since I have met my deductible this year.",

Not that it matters, it is just another fight to get on with...  guess I am on a jag, if it is cancer I need to clear out some of the overwhelming junk around this house.  I am getting rid of about 1/3 of the clothes in my closet... it is bad.. I still have some clothes from college.  I haven't fit in them... well... since college 35 years ago.  Those are actually in the attic.  But all pants that don't have pockets, are going.  Finally following my FIL's advise, if you haven't worn it in the past year, you probably won't, get rid of it.  Heck, I still have some of my Mom's clothes - and she has been gone for 31 years. She was much smaller than me, I will never fit in them.   I hate being a clothes hoarder.  But I am.  8 years ago, when we moved here, I had 61 lawn bags full of clothes to give to charity.  Laughing... at least I finally found the tote box I had put all my sweat pants in last spring.  I don't work, so my life consists of horses and house.  I have shorts or sweats... a few pair of jeans I never wear.  North Mississippi, it is either cold, or hot... not much in between.  I am still so on edge.  My daughter (the one who lives here) called earlier, and I immediately feared it was the doctor calling with the results... wanting them, but not wanting them. My best friend texted and she is going to come down tomorrow for my birthday.  She said she would help me clean out, but I text back that cleaning house on my birthday is the last thing I want to do. If I haven't heard yet, maybe she will help me decorate the house for Christmas.  Wish I had more Xanax.  Sometimes, I wish I could drink... I wasn't a drinker before chemo, but now after... even a small sip burns.  I smoked pot in my younger years, but I am actually mildly allergic to it. My sinus cavities swell and gives me a wicked headache. no vices for this girl. As everyone knows... us more than most... CANCER SUCKS ",
