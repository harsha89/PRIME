I have been having searing breast pain in the right breast that mirrors milk let down when breastfeeding. I am 42 and clearly not pregnant or breastfeeding (my youngest is eight). Has anyone else suffered through pain like this? If I keep my sports bra on tight, the pain is manageable. If I take it off, the pain takes my breath away. Thanks :-) Log in to post a reply",

My right breast feels very similar to that full feeling that was present with breast feeding and that sharp pain when you are engorged. Doctor's appointment is booked for the 17th.",
