I am so sorry to hear about your nails and eyelashes! I just can't believe that we have to go through this post chemo! I am 5 weeks out as of Monday.

The answer was yes, you will lose your hair. I had long hair and cut it short about 1 1/2 weeks after my first round. I didn't start losing it until after my second treatment. Two days after my second treatment actually. Funny thing is that the hair along my neckline never fell out. I kept it. I never shaved my head either. I had some long ostrich looking pieces. I am now three weeks out and it is growing back. It will grow back, keep that in mind. Hang in there!",

Just a thought.... her hair looked awesome! Bold: Hang in there! Give the Nioxin some time.... I think it is helping and after a while it does not burn anymore. I have been using it for about a month or so, 6 weeks PFC (TCH) today, and I have noticed more growth in the last week. I have about 1/8\" - 1/4\" of regrowth. I am also taking the Biotin vitamin. I believe Chelev takes it too. You are so lucky that you did not lose your eyebrows or eyelashes! I lost quite a few eyelashes, not all... and my eyebrows got very thin and vanished on the ends. I am seeing some regrowth on both now! So exciting! I too am on Herceptin. Shadow38: It sounds as if you have all the se's and if your scalp hurt and no hair fell out, I think that you must have some strong hair follicles and that the chemo IS working! Mine started to come out 3 weeks after I started treatments. It was two days after my second one. You may be one of the lucky ones! I gained about 7 lbs during treatments. Guess it was from the steriods they say. Chubby and confused is right!",

I hope I hear something today. Supposed to start rads now tomorrow. If we don't hear anything today, it will most likely be pushed out some more. Please put some positive thoughts out there!
