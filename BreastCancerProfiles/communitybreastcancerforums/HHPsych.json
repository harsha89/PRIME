I had extreme nausea each round and diarrhea. I felt hungover pretty much the first 2 weeks. I did have to stop taking Perjeta after my third round because it was damaging my liver. I had my third round delayed for 6 weeks between round 2 and 3 (my side would get so painful I'd puke, and my liver numbers were extremely elevated). After stopping Perjeta, my liver numbers went back to normal.",
