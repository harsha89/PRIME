I had my treatment in the summer, so I swam a lot in my parents' pool, took lots of walks, and even jogged a couple times. Before treatment, I was running a couple miles 2-3 times a week and going to the gym regularly. I don't think I would have been able to keep up with that, but definitely try and do as much as you can! ",

I had a bit of peripheral neuropathy (tingling, numbness in toes and fingertips) but I am now 3 months out and it is completely gone. Other than that and losing my eyebrows/eyelashes, I can't remember any SEs from Taxol. That said, everyone is completely different, so as much as it might help you to hear other people's experiences, I don't think any answer will be able to predict your own reaction to either drug. I'm no doctor, but from what I understand, Taxol and Taxotere are used interchangeably as they are in the same drug family (taxanes). I just did a quick Google and found this, which might also be helpful because it shows differences in the outcomes with the two drugs: www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/.... I think your best bet is to do some research, maybe ask the doctor who recommended Taxotere if he has a specific reason for recommending it, and try to make an informed decision that way. I will say that I got two opinions on chemo from top-notch research institutions (UPenn and Fox Chase Cancer Center) and both recommended Taxol. Still - that doesn't necessarily mean much considering all breast cancers are different and all treatment centers are different. ",
