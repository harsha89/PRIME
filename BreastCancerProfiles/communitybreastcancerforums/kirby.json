I had been on arimidex for 4 years and my oncologist said it quit working. I am now taking aromasin and will take it for 6wks and then more scans to see how well it is working (fingers crossed). I also went to MD Anderson in Houston and they felt aromosin was the way to go. I am too new at this, so this is the best information I can share with you, but I am sure more experienced ladies will chime in. As far as age, I am 58, so not too far behind you.

I actually had an appointment with my oncologist the same day to get my first Zometa, but didn't mention it because it was very minor at the time. Every day since then it has gradually gotten worse and worse, like a hot poker stabing me. I was recently dx with bone and liver mets, but not in this area, could it have spread in 1 month? I have been taking aromosin for a little over a month. They did tumor marker test at my appointment and was waiting to see the results of that before I got too concerned, but Friday I was told the lab failed to do this test, so won't know anything until Wednesday of this week. In the meantime I plan to call and see my oncologist tomorrow, but really getting concerned with this constant pain! Any ideas? freaking out... :(-  xoxo Dx 9/1/2009, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 2/7 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Going for CT scan for liver tomorrow so not sure if it would pick up if my rib was cracked. I guess if the pain doesn't improve with time I will get an xray. I had a Zometa infusion a week ago. Thanks for your input and hope things are going well for you.  xoxo",

I feel tired, beat up, in a funk, and can't think of anything I want to be doing while on chemo.  I know I should embrace this time. I know I should be happy the chemo is working. But, I on the other hand know with some certainty that this is my new way of living, It is just hard to find any joy right now. I don't want to give up to this freaking disease, but I don't want my QOL to be anymore lessened than it is now. We all walk such a fine line here. I do know that my mother in law died 25 years ago of breast cancer, and I can only think that yes we have made improvements in treatment, we are still loosing too many to this thing called cancer, Thanks for listening and understanding, and I do hope I will have an option of going back on an AI in September.

They are synthetic, but so much better than the wigs I had 5 years ago. I remember they itched and they just didn't look as good. I find this time around since I have a little fuzz not much itching with the wig on and nobody can tell it is a wig. I decided this time I would get my wigs professional washed every few weeks and it has made a tremendous difference in the way they look and also makes me feel better! I think I am spending more on my wigs than I ever did on my real hair. . Maybe you can find one you like and start wearing that one and then somehow transition into the expensive wig. I am with you though. I told my husband that if and when it is my time to go I better have some freaking hair on my head. Why or why can't most chemos not have the side effect of hair loss. For me I think I would feel so much better if I could hold on to my hair. Hope tomorrow the sun comes out and it is a better day for you~the crap we have to put up with xoxo PS. I wear a liner under the wig and it has helped with the itch :}-",

My sister drove in from out of town to cut it off which took about 20 minutes, it was surreal. So the moral to my story, is be prepared and cut it very short now.

Does that mean I am Stage IV now ( was staged initially at IIB) I guess I will find out more tomorrow at my oncologist appt., but just trying to prepare. What questions should I be asking at my appointment? I am a wreck. Thanks. Dx 9/1/2009, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 2, 2/7 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

I had my liver bx today. It was a piece of cake ( well for me, I don't know about the doctor:)-) Seriously, no pain and went smoothly. Sometimes I think oh my, this all won't be too hard to tolerate and then a minute later tears are streaming down my face. It will be a long holiday weekend for me. I will let you know what the bx results are. In the meantime I am scheduling a consult at M D Anderson. Much Love, xoxo",
