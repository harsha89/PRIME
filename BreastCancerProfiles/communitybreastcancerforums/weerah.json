      "Content": "weerah wrote: I started chemo on Sept 16 and after getting just about every side effect possible, I have now developed a face rash from hell. My face is bright red and covered in tiny little whiteheads. I do have rosacea, but this is rosacea on crack x100.  My chemo doc said since it's not an allergic reaction, I should go see my dermatologist. The last thing I want to do is go to yet another doctor's appointment on top of all the others. So I thought I'd ask here. Has anyone developed anything like this? How can I treat it? Will it go away or do I have to deal with it throughout chemo?  TIA! Dx 6/7/2011, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 1/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Mostly I wish I had done both but I don't have enough tummy fat to make two breasts and I don't want implants, so that's mainly why I made the choice I did. I guess I'll have to see how I feel in five years.",
