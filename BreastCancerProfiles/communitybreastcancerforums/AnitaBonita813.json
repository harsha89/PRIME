    "Content": "AnitaBonita813 wrote: Hi all--- My screening tomo mammo reported a 1 CM oval density with slightly irregular margins. However, at Thursday's diagnostic mammogram, both the tech and the radiologist could find nothing on the ultrasound. They did another tomo mammo and found the spot again. The radiologist's reaction was \"Oh, well. We'll look at it again in 6 months.\" I did not like my radiologist's reaction. It has apparently grown since last year's mammo. I've asked my OB to request a second opinion or to advise me further. Are there cancers that do not show up on US but do on mammograms? I'm happy to search out Dr. Google for more info and/or insist on an MRI if needed. I am 53 and barely perimenopausal. My aunt had breast cancer at 57 and her daughter had her ovaries removed last year for looking suspicious. Thanks all for your advice on this!! Anita Log in to post a reply",
