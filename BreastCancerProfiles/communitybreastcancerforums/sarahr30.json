(I don't have a cancer diagnosis--just dealing with breast issues but I had some imaging done a few months after stopping breastfeeding and even then the doctors said some of what they were seeing could be remnants of lactation).

Still, i'd request an ultrasound because you never know and you are also feeling very anxious. The fear and anxiety aren't good for you either.

I had an ultrasound in June that showed a milldly complicated 6mm cyst (some internal echoes). Ultrasound was repeated with mammo because my OB-GYN felt thickening in the left breast. Mammo was clear except for benign calcifications and ultrasound still showed cyst. She referred me to a breast surgeon to ease my mind. He examined me, viewed my scans, and has put me on 6 month monitoring because he wants to see if the cyst changes so I go back in February for ultrasound. Sorry that was long-winded--just wanted to give you background. Anyway, I would say go to the breast surgeon, hear what he/she has to say. I wouldn't settle for less than some additional monitoring--an ultrasound in a few months at least--unless you feel comfortable what what the doctor says. If the symptoms persist then SOMETHING is going on and it is unlikely to be cancer but it's still important to find out what's happening. Is the cyst palpable? Mine isn't so the surgeon isn't convinced it is the cause of my pain and recommended things like a change of bra and vitamin E. I don't wear an underwire so I don't think that is it. What kind of pain are you having? It could always be hormonal as well. Increased estrogen levels can cause breast and ovarian cysts--I have both as well. I hope you feel better and get some answers!

I breastfed for like 3 years so the BS said in my case they are probably \"remnants\" of that. I have heard that duct ectasia (dilated ducts) can cause the breasts to invert, nipple discharge and other symptoms and since the indent seems to be in the same spot as the duct it seems like you probably have a plausible explanation for it. I can't remember if you had any pain as well? I've had a lot of pain in the breast with the dilated ducts but radiologist said the ducts wouldn't cause that kind of pain and it is likely the cyst I have, fibrocystic changes, or something else.

It's interesting because i've also had hair thinning for a while now, fatigue and mood swings (i'm 33). I have fibrocystic breasts also and had two ultrasounds and a mammo in the past few months but all they show are a cyst and duct widening in my left breast (I breastfed in the last year). I've had all kinds of blood tests and thyroid is checking out fine as well (I even had an ultrasound). Have you had any testing? I think you definitely should at least get checked out by an OB-GYN, who would likely order an ultrasound. If you haven't been breastfeeding then i'd definitely want to find out what that drainage is. Pain can also signal a problem so it is worth getting checked!",

      "Content": "sarahr30 wrote: Hello all! I had an estrogen metabolism blood test because my regular progesterone and estrogen blood tests showed I was estrogen dominant. I was reading through the lab report of the metabolism test and it showed I have high (out of range) levels of 16alpha-Hydroxyestrone and low (in range) levels of 2-Hydroxyestrone . My ratio of 2:16alpha-Hydroxyestrone is out of range low. I read that these kinds of results can be associated with breast cancer and i've been having some issues with my left breast. Anyone have any insights into how accurately these tests correlate with breast cancer risk? I'm curious if anyone on here with breast cancer has had these tests? I'm taking DIM and increased omegas and Vitamin D to hopefully shift these numbers. Thanks :) Log in to post a reply",

Or does it not really matter. My breasts are heterogeneously dense. Just trying to figure out what week to schedule for. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
