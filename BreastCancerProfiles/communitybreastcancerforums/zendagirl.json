My sisters have been looking at this Y90 Internal Radiation which can be used on metastatic breast cancer to the liver.  We are looking to see if I would even be a candidate.  Not a cure, but may give me more time. Has anyone out here ever done the Y90 treatment?  If so, can you share your experience with that?  If you have had Gemzar how did it affect you? I know everyone's response to chemo etc...is different, but it's still nice to get a picture from others. Thanks!

Now, as you are, fighting for all the time we can get. My hair comes and goes right now. I'm at that very short point, and those who may not know me assume I've fought the fight and I'm doing well. Ummmm, no I'm not doing OK. It is frustrating when those considerably older than us don't understand what we're facing.",
