The doctor said that he could reduce the dose of Taxotere; but I said no.  When you can't breathe, it scares the hell out of you!  And I have paralyzed vocal cord, which made me even more scared to try the Taxotere again.  So, I was started on the CMF protocol.  I was given ten treatments.  I took the treatments weekly.  I will be starting Abraxane in about a week and half. I'm scared because it's in the same category as Taxotere.  They tell me that I should not have a reaction because Abraxane does not have the \"cremophor binder\"; it has a \"human albumin binder\", which should not cause a reaction.  The oncologist said that I don't even have to be premedicated with Decadron. Anyway, is anyone else on Dose Intense chemotherapy? How's it working out? ______________________________ Dose-dense chemotherapy refers to a chemotherapy treatment plan where the interval between successive treatments is reduced when compared to a standard regimen. An example of this would be the BCCA protocol BRAJACTG (Adjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer Using Dose Dense Therapy: Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide followed by Paclitaxel). The drugs given in this protocol are given in the same dose on a two week schedule rather than the standard three week treatment schedule of BRAJACT. Various dose-dense treatment regimens are being investigated as a way to improve survival benefit. Dose-dense chemotherapy also implies that the overall length of the chemotherapy period is reduced. There is increased concern about toxicity with dose-dense chemotherapy regimens, including neutropenia, for which filgrastim (G-CSF) is considered. It is not common to refer to dose-intense chemotherapy, but rather to refer to the dose intensity of chemotherapy. Dose intensity is defined as the amount of drug delivered per unit of time, expressed as mg/m2/week, regardless of the schedule or route of administration. This is simply a method of comparing total dose given over a period of time between or among treatment protocols. Specific calculations can be made that then describe the intended dose intensity, the dose intensity of a treatment protocol, or the actual dose intensity received by the patient of a specific treatment regimen. These descriptions are based on the calculation of relative dose intensity (RDI), which is the amount of drug delivered per unit of time relative to an arbitrarily chosen standard. A reduction in dose intensity may negatively effect patient survival, particularly in those with potentially curable malignancies. There may be some variation in how these definitions are interpreted and examples of studies referring to dose-intense chemotherapy can be found in the literature. http://www.bccancer.bc.ca/RS/CommunitiesOncologyNetwork/Educators/faqs.htm#dose \"If you ever drop your keys into a river of molten lava, let 'em go, because, man, they're gone.\" Jack Handey Dx 10/8/2010, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIC, Grade 3, 40/40 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
