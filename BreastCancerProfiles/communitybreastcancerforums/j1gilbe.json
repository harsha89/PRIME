Nobody knows what to do with me. I am so frustrated because I waited 2 months to start a MDX-1105 monochronal antibody trial, but got disqualified at the last minute. They are saying that because of my bone mets taking over, I am not producing enough blood cells. My platelets were dow to 96,000 but came up over 100,000 themselves a week later. My hemoglobin was down to 8.3 but came up to 8.6 a week later. I keep telling my Dr. that I had severe rectal bleeding from hemorrhoids for over a month and maybe thats why my counts dropped. No, they insist that I have bone marrow insufficiency. This disqualifies me for most trials. I am literally falling through the cracks. All I do is go to the doctor, get scans, over and over and still no treatment. Any advice is welcome. Dx 1/1/1999, DCIS, Stage IV, Grade 2, 4/15 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

My low blood counts are disqualifying me for trials. I had a transfusion last week and I am sure they are much higher now. Most trials want platelets above 100,000 and hemoglobin over 9. Sorry for the rambling.",

I am against chemo at this point because of QOL issues with the blood counts. I just can't believe I am not \"healthy\" enough for phase 1 trials just because of my anemia. I am a 12 year survivor (9 years with mets). I live a normal life and I am active and able to keep up with others my age. A lot of my friends and none of my neighbors even know I have cancer. I had my greatest success with AI's, so I will check into the estrogen. Thanks! Jeanne in Houston (really close to MD Anderson)",
