Taking meds when not needed is an issue for both the provider and the patient. But yes, we must have antibiotics in our arsenal and use them when required! Absolutely. I just didn't make the point that we need antibiotics despite the potential nasty side effects. And that if your doctor said, \"I want to give you this med, but x-y-z can happen\", we'd probably still take the med. So it becomes a rhetorical question: if the doctor told you that a tendon rupture was a low-risk possibility (for Levaquin), would you refuse the med? Do we blame our provider when we get side effects or allergic reactions? You are right, though, the provider holds the prescription pad! As well as the opportunity to educate people about the perils of unnecessary medications, not just antibiotics. And the conusmer/patient needs to be educated, and often denied, when they request certain meds. That's a whole 'nother topic, not related to this OP, and I'm sorry for putting it in here, as well as not expressing my bias better. The OP wa a simple warning. I should have left it at that.",

But essentially, an U/S guided biopsy is for a solid-appearing mass. (Calcifications usually get a stereotactic.) It's common for these to be done by the intervention radiologists. You don't need a breast surgeon yet. Try to bear in mind that most biopsies are benign. Go ahead and keep your head in the sand for now. You can't control anything yet. Ask questions as you feel the need, but until you have a definitive diagnosis, you don't even really know what questions to aslk. I've had a number of these biopsies. A good radiologist numbs you well, and a good nurse is by your side for a hand-holding, and then to hold pressure on the biopsy site for about 10 minutes after. Wear a bra that will hold an ice pack, and stick with tylenol for pain (no extra bleeding potential.) Â The hardest part, as I'm sure you know, is the long wait for the biopsy report. Hang in there.

She was told that her biopsy showed 1mm of DCIS, so she had a lumpectomy, radiation, and tamoxifen (briefly)?? Now, the opinion was NO cancer after all, so how to follow? That's chilling, to have had surgery and rads for no reason. I don't think breast radiation increases the risk of breast cancer. LCIS is a marker for potentially developing breast cancer as you know. At a minimum, your friend needs to find a breast center she trusts for advice. I mean, at this point, she still needs her vigilant, routine screenings of mammos, clinical breast exams, and possibly MRIs. Tamoxifen isn't recommended for LCIS. But if she truly had DCIS (yes, get those path slides re-evaluated one more time!) it could be. But for 1mm of DCIS? Was it super-aggressive DCIS? Bottom line--get a thrid path reading. Take those results and the others to a major medical center and be presented at their tumor board. Best of luck to your friend, Anne",

A friend of mine had the same pain you describe after her mastectomy and node dissection. She took Lyrica (next-generation Neurontin) and it relieved ehr pain so much. And she only needed it for a few months while the nerve was healing. There is no telling what, if any, side effects you'd experience. But if you decide to try a med under your doctor's supervision, my advice is to \"start low and go slow.\" In other words, start at a low dose and gradually increase it. Less issues with side effects that way. Some docs, though, know little to nothing about pain management. You may have to search for one who wants to treat you with something other than narcotics--which don't really do much for nerve pain other than dumb you up a bit. Some people do okay with Lidoderm patches for a small area of nerve pain. I hope your pain will resolve on its own. Taking a med to get you over the hump is important--you do not want your body to think of pain as being \"the norm.\" You need to break the pain cycle. That said, what's really unfortunate that post-mastectomy pain syndrome does not always resolve. Some women are left for the rest of their lives with chronic nerve pain. I hope you will not fall into that category! Good luck, Anne",

By Friday, I was up to getting in some treadmill and stretching time. But certain stretches on the right side sent pain like a hot, sharp knife into my armpit and shoulder blade. It was so sudden and intense that I literally gasped and would have dropped to my knees, had I not already been on the floor. Saturday, it happened every time I stretched out my upper body. Horrible! Ice helped a little. Sunday, it was most of the day when I walked, or moved my arm. From the top of the breast to the edge of my scapula. In addition to the hot knife, there is also a dull ache and a burning sensation to the skin. I know what this is. I was hoping maybe to see the rash of herpes zoster or shingles. But I know this is post-op nerve pain/post-mastectomy syndrome. Not very common, but it certainly happens. Shit. I can't even wear my Iron Maiden post op bra due to the pain, so now I'm afraid my new girls are going to try to migrate back toward my armpits. I've worked in a pain clinic, so I know the drill. I'm calling my pain buddies for Lyrica right away. And maybe lidoderm patches. Maybe even an injection, if nipping it in the bud is the right thing to do.And then I'll call my ps and tell him what's up. I see him Wednesday for my post-op follow-up. And I have a feeling I know way more about this than he does. I'm hoping this will be short-lived.

She's great with LE, gentle massage and range of motions, and figuring out what my body is doing and what needs to be done. In the meantime, I have my lido patch on, I have Lyrica waiting for my bedtime. Definitely need to stop the cycle of pain, because the body has memory! The stiller I am, the less I hurt. So needless to say, I didn't go to spin class or walk on the treadmill today!

The problem is that the body remembers these nerve pathways, and you need to \"reboot\" your system, so to speak, either through massage or medications specific for nerve pain or nerve blocks. There's not often an easy answer, and not too many of our doctors really understand this (or any) type of pain. I'm not sure your pain has anything to do with the blood blisters.

But a simple mastectomy with lymph node sampling is the smart thing, in my opinion. There's only a little breast tissue at her age, so the surgery itself will only be tough because of the node biopsy. (That's an ouch for most of us!) And by the time she's 16-18, she'll be developed enough that reconstruction can give her a good match, especially if she can go with a tissue transfer like DIEP. Or who knows what will be available for her by that time! Are the docs talking about genetics testing for her cancer? I have a granddaughter about Hannah's age, and I can't imagine having to go through bc with her so young! You guys are holding together, and at some point you'll crash. Be ready for it. Hannah is a real trooper, but at 10, she may understand what cancer is, but she doesn't have the fear that we get as we age and as we know more about the disease, or have lost family and friends to it. So, she'll get through the treatment better than most of us and then get back to the business of being a kid. (Though perhaps wiser than most, because of it all.) Kids are so resiliant. I wish you and the whole family the best. I love the pic of Hannah and JJ on the website. Thanks for sharing her with us.

We were just beginning breast MRIs back then, so it was not part of my diagnostic workup. I always suspected that something \"might\" be going on in my \"good\" breast. Even when an MRI was done to check out an irregular spot a few years later, an area of low suspicion was ignored in favor of getting out some ADH in a different spot. A few years later, that ignored area was a barely palpable cancer. So, if you suspect something is lurking in the other breast, you owe it to yourself to get it checked out. Trust your inner voice. Know that MRIs do give false positives, and you may have to endure some anxiety-provoking biopsies. I really don't know why any doctor would requst a unilateral MRI. It hardly costs any extra. Good luck getting this figured out. Bongo hugs, Anne (the REAL Granny Annie.

MY personal feeling is that if you can keep your breasts with a good cosmetic outcome, do it. But if you're going to have ONE breast removed for disease, then take them both, and get recon at the same time. Consider skin sparing/nipple sparing on the healthy breast and flap surgery for the best outcome. Best of luck. This is really a difficult decision, but you'll make the right choice for you.",

My local onc said chemo was \"up to me\". My rad onc said I should definitely have chemo because of my age. (Age is not a prognostic factor!) I took it on myself to get a second opinion by a bc specialist at UCLA, who said chemo would only help about 3 out of 100 women with my type of cancer. But taking something systemic (tamoxifen or AI) was necessary. It's interesting to me how emotional and adamant some doctors get about what we should do, when they are not the specialist. Family docs, surgeons, radiation docs all weigh in with their \"expert\" opinions on what we should do. I guess we, as survivors, do the same, unfortunately. Everyone's got an opinion. It's just a matter of whose opinion you, the patient, value most. I'm obviously a big fan of second opinions by big-name folks, if available (probably because I got the advice I wanted to hear?) If my second bc had been found at the time of the first one (which I personally believe would have been done had breast MRI been available to me then) I would have gotten emotional and had chemo, even though that may not have been necessary...retrospect is not easy or fair at times. Anyway, anyone who is needing to make this really tough decision--really listen to the experts. Try to get your emotions out of this highly emotional topic. Look hard at the stats (though for some, stats don't bear out, unfortunately.) Understand the difference between relative risk and actual risk. Get an onc who will explain all this to you in plain terms. Even with all this, there are sleepless nights. Making the decision is the toughest part of the journey. At least, for today. best, Anne",

Before that diagnosis, I had always said that if I got cancer, both breasts would come off and I'd be done. When faced with the reality, there was no real reason for me to do that, and I wanted to conserve my breast. I didn't have problems with radiation. No chemo. Six years later, I had a new cancer in the other breast. I chose bilateral mastectomies then. My radiated side tolerated the implant pretty well, but I had issues with scar tissue on both sides. Ultimately, I had bilateral SGAP. I kinda wish I'd done THAT from day one, the breasts look and feel so natural. But, I didn't, and I'm not one to look back with regret for what I didn't know at the time. That's just my story. What's hard is trying to make the decision. Nothing will be exactly as you planned. There's a lot of adjusting along the way. But once you make a decision that supports your values, then move forward and don't look back. You'll work it out.

Awesome that the nodes are clear, and the invasive cancer is less than thought! I remember being obsessed with learning about chemo. At 1 cm, it wasn't necessarily \"required\", but I could do it if I chose to. I had people in my face to face support group tell me point blank that I was crazy NOT to. That upset me to the point that I quit the group and found my own friends who supported me and my decision process in a way I needed. I couldn't understand why in holy hell would I want to put A/C in my system and risk heart damage, when the odds were low that chemo would help me at all. I would have chosen a longer course of CMF for fewer side effects. And why was no one advising me to get the ovaries out, when that was the standard of care for early stage bc in Europe? I ultimately chose ovarian suppression (then removal) and hormonal treatment. I still got a new primary, a year after stopping AIs. Maybe it was there all along and the AIs kept it in check. My theory, but we'll never know. So, statistically, I'm a new primary in the other breast post treatment. Moot now. I don't think you sound hopeless and resigned to dying. I think you are looking for control of a terrible situation, and for validation of your values. I understand that completely. And I know there is NO guarantee that with or without chemo, the cancer may or may not recur. Stastically, your chances of overall survival are better with chemo. We don't have \"designer chemo\" yet--tailor made just for your tumor. EXCEPT where herceptin comes in, and that's about as designer as you can get. Back in the 60s, my mom developed Stage 111b breast cancer. Many positive nodes. She was only 39. She did a radical mastectomy and cobalt radiation--no chemo (whether or not it was even offered, I'll never know.) She lived to raise us three kids, dying of colon cancer (and I think peritoneal mets from what must have been ILC) at age 60. I miss her every day, but she DID live against the odds to raise her kids, which was her goal. Anyway, what you are going through right no is THE hardest part. Or at least it was for me. Deciding what was the right path to take in my treatment. If I had had your tumor type and size, it would have been a no-brainer, even without kids to see grow up. But I am not in your shoes. This is truly your choice. It's about as lonely a place as you can find right now. Anne",

My tumor was only 1 cm the first go-round. The debate raged then about chemo for me (I was 44) even with very favorable prognostic factors for my cancer (before the days of oncotype.) My second opinion doc at UCLA said no chemo was okay as long as I did hormonals as a systemic treatment. So, after lumpectomy and rads, I tried Tamoxifen, had problems with it, then ultimately had the ovaries out and went on Femara. Fast forward 6 years, and there's a new cancer in the other breast. I don't regret not taking chemo--not at all--but it ws scary and sobering. My story will not be your story. Your story will not be anyone else's. You and your docs need to make a decision based on many factors. Surely they've plugged your numbers into Adjuvant! and seen what your risk of recurrence is with 3 cm mass and Her2+, regardless of nodes. The best advice I can give is to research the heck out of your options, then examine your value system. Then, make a decision and don't look back with regrets if your cancer recurs or metastisizes.

Based on mammogram and ultrasound, my surgeon told me he was nearly certain it was cancer. I was ready to write my obituary! It turned out to be a fibroadenoma (benign). While we all know intellectually that we could have cancer, I hate it when suregeons/radiologists/etc take away your hope. And while going through that \"scare\" prepared me a bit for the cancer that was to come 8 years later, I never really forgave my surgeon for his assumption, educated though it may have been.

The only sign of swelling is perhaps a tad more indentation from my bra, both on my shoulder and under my arm to around the back a little ways. And my classic sign of mild LE--my index finger tip tingles. No redness, swelling, no infection or cuts or nicks. I'm 4 years out from lumpectomy, axillary dissection, and rads. I work out religiously, and have since my original surgery. I lift weights and swim and rock climb. The ONLY time I've had a hint of LE was right after rads & hiking in the cold at high altitude.

You're trying to get information, make life-changing decisions when you don't have enough data to make a good one, convince people you are okay, take care of your family, work--all when you really just want to curl up in a ball and sob. But, you DO have time. Take a deep breath. Start learning all you can--not just by asking us what we've been through (though that does have its place!) but by reading. Get Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. It's the bible for us. Breast conservation (lumpectomy and radiation) is usually encouraged, but it's truly your choice. I'm one who gladly went that route, and had 5 more years to live with my breasts till I got a new cancer last month. Now both breasts are gone and I'm \"under construction.\" Would I have done it any differently? No, I don't think so, but it's not really a fair question in hindsight. You just have to make a decision and not look back with the \"what ifs.\" I hope your cancer is for sure Stage 1 and no other treatment than hormonals will be needed. Till you get the node/s out and the margins clear, and the estrogen receptors back, you'll not know for sure. Just take your time to get your ducks in a row. Make your decision based on information, not just fear. (And yes, some breast cells can be left behind after a mastectomy. Whether or not these will ever become cancerous is not known. And Stage 1 tumors can metastasize at some point in your life, though it's not as likely. You will, I'm afraid, never be free and clear of cancer. It will always be in the back of your mind. But, you CAN keep living your life and be happy and move forward.) Hope this doesn't overwhelm you. hang in there. Anne",

In a nutshell, there's a benign condition called \"proliferative\" breast disease which can be a prelude to cancer. This may explain mixed tumor types. Estrogen Linked to Benign Breast Lumps April 09, 2008 WASHINGTON - Add another risk to hormone therapy after menopause: Benign breast lumps. One type of hormone therapy - estrogen plus progestin - already is well-known to increase the risk of breast cancer. But a major study of women able to use estrogen alone didn't find that link. Tuesday, researchers reported a new wrinkle: Those estrogen-only users doubled their chances of getting non-cancerous breast lumps. That's a concern not only because of the extra biopsies and worry those lumps cause, but because <i>a particular type - called benign proliferative breast disease - is suspected of being a first step toward developing cancer 10 years or so later. <\/i> About one in five women undergo a breast biopsy within a decade of starting annual mammograms, and most are of those abnormalities turn out to be benign. Yet under a microscope, there are different types, from simple fluid-filled cysts to what's called proliferative breast disease because it's made of growing cells. The latest work, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, re-examines data from the landmark Women's Health Initiative that found a variety of health risks from long-term hormone therapy. Only women who have undergone hysterectomies are able to use estrogen- only therapy, and the WHI originally included more than 10,000 of those women, who were given either estrogen or a dummy drug and tracked for about seven years. Now, a team led by Dr. Tom Rohan of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York has reviewed breast biopsies done on those women - and identified 232 cases of benign proliferative breast disease. Women given the estrogen-only therapy had twice the risk of developing these abnormalities compared with women given a placebo. WHI participants are still being tracked, allowing scientists to eventually tell if the benign breast problems were a signal of more trouble to come, Rohan concluded.",

When the palpable lump is a part of your imaging histroy, the radiologist always addresses it in one way or another. (or at least s/he should!) If no corresponding mass was seen on mammo, the almost always classify you with a high BIRADS score, meaning further follow-up is indicated. They do that to cover their butts, but that's exactly what the person who ordered your mammo in the first place should do. In other words, if you you have a palpable mass not seen on mammo, then the radiologist should recommend either U/S or MRI. If they don't the person who felt your lump and ordered the mammo is obligated to do a further work up, or refer you to a surgeon. Telling a woman with a lump to \"wait a few months\" when no other work up has been done is, to ME, negligent. But, many women who have been told to get rechecked in 6 months don't come back for a year or more, and are mad because now they have a higher stage cancer. Bottom line, mammos are NOT definitive. The media plays them up way too much as a way to \"catch\" cancer early. For every woman who had her cancer diagnosed by mammogram, there's another who did not.",

I had the typical brachial plexus trauma--numbness along the back of my arm, a little cording initially. But no LE and full range of motion in no time. My scars tend to heal thickly. They stay red and raised for a long time. A vertical scar can be pulled too tightly, the same as a horizontal one, and give a bunched up appearance. You should heal fine. Your risk of LE is the same regardless of scar orientation. Mobilizing the scar area gently through massage and motion should help you get back to your activities in a timely manner. (And sometimes surgeons don't know exactly what approach they will take till they get to the OR.)

Looking back later if a recurrence happens serves no useful purpose. If you're the type who second-guesses things, then make your decision based on that. I had a lumpectomy and rads. Did just fine, with my very dense breasts, till I developed a new primary in the other breast. Then I had both removed. While I toyed with the idea of having both removed with my first cancer (despite the cancer being very small and well-differentiated), I was ultimately glad I got to \"keep\" my breasts for the next 5-6 years. Dense breasts do make imaging a little harder. Dense breasts do not cause cancer. I'm not sure I would amputate a breast because it's dense. Multi-focal disease, though, in a dense breast would cause me to ponder and really figure out what my fears and values were. Which is where you are right now. Good luck with this highly personal, intensely difficult choice. Anne",

It sounds to me like a biopsy is in order, and then you take it from there. I had a friend go through this in her late 70s. She opted for a mastectomy, no reconstruction, no chemo (small tumor, ER-, node -) She and her oncologist figured she would not die from breast cancer--heart disease is still her worst enemy at that age. She's doing great, knowing that the cancer--as far as she can tell--is out of her body. You can't tell if a mass is cancer or not just by palpating it. So what you feel in your mom's breast may not be cancer at all. Take one step at a time, take a breath. It's a freak-out kind of time, but focus on getting the best diagnosis in a timely manner.

Sometimes the dye and tracer show multiple nodes that take up the stuff equally, and the surgeon will remove the bunch. Other times, there may be a true, single sentinal node, but the surgeon gets several close by to be on the safe side. Other surgeons see the sentinal, trust that it's truly the first in line, and take only that one node. So, having a group of nodes removed doesn't mean anything yet. It won't change the fact that you'll have chemo. Multiple positive nodes might mean rads, but you will deal with that if you have to. Adequate treatment trumps reconstruction.

Why do you need a mastectomy and not a lumpectomy? If you know it's going to be a mastectomy and you want reconstruction, start studying your options NOW. Find the book THE BREAST RECONSTRUCTION GUIDEBOOK by Kathy Steligo. It lays everything out so clearly Too often we're caught up in the emotion of getting out the cancer, and rush the decision about reconstruction. And browse the reconstruction heading here--there's tons of info that you'll want to wade through. It's a very intense decision to make, many factors involved (like whether you'll need rads, chemo, what types your plastic surgeon does vs what type you WANT, etc.) Numb and exhausted are normal. Just know that usually you have TIME to make a good decision. That cancer's been there a while. A few more days (or weeks) while you get your info together generally is an okay thing. Good luck, Anne",

If you want a mastectomy, fine, maybe he's your man. But then what about reconstruction? Immediate recon means one less surgery, but you need to get with a plastic surgeon for that, and that can take a little time to coordinate. Even with immediate recon, you generally don't need 5 days in the hospital (unless it's the advanced recon like DIEP--and I'm certain your surgeon doesn't do that!) Don't be rushed!!

But since I had a very skilled microvascular surgeon doing my new recon, I figured it didn't hurt to ask her to examine that area closely. (My surgeon is Dr. Marga Massey. I had to travel to Charleston, SC to have the surgery. I live in CO.) Anyway, she marked my skin in the area of the nerve and was able to find it and fix it. Some of the discomfort has returned as the nerve regrew over these past 8 months. But it's very superficial and I rarely feel it when I wear a bra. I can't stress enough finding some sort of pain management that works. Chronic pain is hard to treat. It's best to get aggressive with PMPS from the outset so the body doesn't think this pain is the \"norm.\" A nerve block may be effective, too, if done by a skilled, board certified pain specialist. Deep tissue massage always made my pain worse. My PT (who is also an LE specialist) did very light massage to reduce scar tissue, but I can't say it helped much. The meds were all that helped me. The thing with Neurontin is that sometimes you have to take really high doses to achieve the goal. And, in CO now, there's medical marijuana!! Not that's anything I'd ever want (I don't think!) but it's an interesting proposition. (Here in Boulder, there's a pot shop on every corner!) Take care, all, Anne",

After much studying and talking, I've decided to go with the bilateral mastectomies with immediate expander/implant reconstruction. For those who may not know, I had IDC 5 years ago on the left, with lumpectomy and rads. Now I have ILC on the right. My girls have gone bad, so to speak, so it's time for new ones. In talking with the plastics guy (whom I dearly love and used to work with several years ago) we agree that I'm far too active for any muscle-related flap. And when you get right down to it, I probably don't have enough fat for a bilateral DIEP or GAP. Despite me being heavier than I've ever been (thanks, menopause!) I still don't have much fat. Except on my thighs!!! So, we're going for the implants, which he feels pretty sure will be successful, despite my previous rads. Were it not for the tattoos, he'd never have known I'd had rads. Of course, we can't really tell how the skin and muscle will respond till we do it. I'm intrigued by the procedures they will be using. The surgeon uses a \"pain buster\" post-op--a thin tube going into each breast area, with a continuous pumping of marcaine/bupivicaine (numbing medicines) for about 5 days (similar to what they use in joint replacement surgery now.) And the plastics guy uses Alloderm (yay!) PLUS Botox to paralyze the pectoral muscle to let it accept the implants without as much spasm. Botox takes about 3 months to wear off. I told him that if he had a little bit left in the vial, not to waste it. I have a wrinkle up near my forehead that drives me crazy... So, after that comes recovery. I have a postsurgery cami on order. Wondering how long before I can drive, exercise, etc, but I realize that's putting the cart before the horse. I need to be patient, I know.

Most post-op infections are nosocomial (meaning hospital-induced.) We can't control the sterility and techniques in the OR, but we CAN control what goes on around us in a hospital room. Make sure there's a lot of hand sanitizer available--and that everyone who enters the room uses it. Usually there's a dispenser placed near the sink, but you may want your own bottle on your bedside table. Before anyone touches you, ask them politely to cleanse first. (And after, is ideal for all the patients they come in contact with after you!) Visitors need to be clean. You need to be clean. Before surgery, shower a couple times with an antiseptic soap like Hibiclens. You can get it at a drug store. I'll be doing this starting two or three days before my surgery. Feel free to ask the pre-op folks how they intend to prevent infection while you're in the OR. Feel free to remind your surgeon to wash up or use sanitizer before s/he comes in to check your dressings and drains. In fact, insist on it. They won't be offended. They don't want any infections on their watch, believe me. Anyone else have suggestions for keeping clean and safe while in the hospital? Or while in the home recovering?

I'd love to help out, having been here for 7 years--I've seen a lot, and experienced a lot. Re the PMPS--it is so very \"for real\" but the surgeons don't really acknowledge it because it implies a less than perfect outcome on their part. And I know so many doctors who believe that educating you about potential bad outcomes means that with every little twinge we'll be calling them in panic mode. When really, it's the exact opposite! One reason to aggressively treat neuropathic pain like PMPS is because the body/brain will start to recognize pain as the norm. By then, it's too late. Like a computer, you need to \"reboot\" the system. Lyrica or Neurontin with Clonazepam or Cymbalta help do that. I had severe nerve pain after my implant exhange--down my side initially, then into my armpit and shoulder blade when I stretched and rotated my body. Horrific! My PS just seemed befuddled. I got to a pain specialist immediately and got on treatment. (I used to work for the pain clinic, so I knew what to do!) The meds helped relieve the pain, but my \"cure\" was when I got the implants out and had flap surgery. My new PS untethered that nerve from the scar tissue that had built up, and I was able to get off meds. Scar tissue was the result, but I agree it didn't START that way! It was interoperative trauma. I suppose that even if I had been advised of this potential, but rare, issue, I would have gone ahead with the surgery. And if I had been given a big list of everything that could possibly go wrong, I wouldn't remember half of it. But it would have been nice to have some resources to refer to when it DID occur, so I wouldn't have felt all alone in my pain. So, how do we limit it to 25?? There are so many potential issues, depending on what the category is. Some of us may focus on reconstruction. Others may want to take up chemo, rads, LE...there are many women here with lots to say, things that can help so many others. I see more than a PDF or tear sheet. We've got ourselves a book! Anne",

I needed every bit of that time off to nurture myself. I couldn't \"give\" to my patients. Working in oncology as a provider-survivor offers a unique set of challenges. It sounds like you have great support. Give yourself some time to recover. Be mindful what you say to patients--keeping the focus on them, not what you've been through.

I would have had no clue what to do in your situation, but probably would have left before I got sick from the stress of it. Is this what we'll be turning out for nurses? What's going to happen when they have to work a double shift, or take an extra load when there's no one else to work?? I have not been in education, other than my current job at a college health center. How does one manage to keep a thick skin, and be tough but fair in assignments and opportunities and expectations? Is this unique to younger nursing students, I wonder, who are definitely a spoiled lot (helicopter parents have ruined this genration!)?? A friend of mine went back to school at age 52, to an ADN program. She was probably the hardest worker and most conscientious in her class, and is one of the really good nurses out there, a throw-back to the old days. I haven't done hospital nursing since I became an NP 20 years ago. Not sure I could return to that setting if I had to. It's the toughest job in our profession. Good on ya for trying to impact a new generation of nurses. And good on ya for being true to yourself and leaving.",

My advice is this: really figure out what you can live with (or without). If you're the type who will worry endlessly about a recurrence, strongly consider the mastectomy. If you're the type who makes solid decisions and doesn't second-guess yourself, you may want to conserve your breast. I had a lumpectomy and rads at 44.

Second, yes, they are expensive. Regardless of HMO or PPO, as medical costs rise, so does your premium and out-of-pocket expense. Third, early scans generally don't improve statistical overall survival. That said, and I'm sure there are folks who will vehemently disagree with me and give me lots of personal experiences that I totally respect and understand, scans obviously DO have a role in cancer management. As do certain lab tests. I remember when my mom had breast cancer in the late 60s--every year after that for ages she had her yearly bone scan, liver-spleen scan, and chest x-ray. Now, we wait till there are symptoms to check for mets, as there is no early detection of mets. On the other hand, some people (but this is not the norm) have more extensive disease at the time of diagnosis. And I think that it's because it's NOT the norm that the scans are not done routinely. And, the results of the scans may not impact the treatment course. One last word about fabricating symptoms in order to get a scan...DON'T. It's fraud. And how can you build a partnership relationship with your provider if you're not telling the truth? You're way better off stating your case and why you want a scan honestly. I'll stop being devil's advocate for now. I may have said things that people don't want to hear, but I'll stand behind why I say them. Anne",

And we all do it differently, and on our own, unique time tables. My first go-round, I cried off and on. But on sunny day, driving down Hwy 101 near Santa Barbara, I just let loose and started screaming. At the top of my lungs, with big gulping sobs and tremors. The world just seemed too beautiful--green hills, sparkling blue ocean, cloudless sky--how dare life be so gorgeous when I had effing cancer?? This go-round, only a few tears, and a determination to move forward as best I can. There's been a lot of water under this bridge for me. Stay here. Take a break if you need to. I was gone for about a year, before cancer brought me back. Do what's right for you. And knowing you, turning off the damned computer may be the best thing you can do for a while. You are a goreous, intelligent woman who has made her life through controlling variables. And your up against a beast who laughs in your face. Who doesn't melt at camel breath. Your brain finally admitted what your heart knew, and it broke you down. BUT--it didn't break your spirit, my dear. You've got tons of that, and we need to be blessed by it. But only on your terms. What a club we have here. We have our theme song (\"Hotel California\"), now we need our secret handshake, our secret password, and maybe our own clan's tatoo (I vote against pink ribbons--too obvious!) Maybe a camel, in honor of our favorite gal? (One hump or two? And are those humps real, or reconstructed? LOL!) Okay, enough from me. I'm glad you're not leaving for good. At first I thought we had evil people here again, attacking through pm's. Glad to see it was just reality kicking your ass. Expect it to happen again, and kick back. I love ya, girlfriend.

When I had my lumpectomy, the surgeon was unable to do the snb because sarring from the excision blocked the path of the dye. So out came two levels of nodes. With my second cancer, the snb worked, thank god. I know of surgeons who do snb's for DCIS, when there's no evidence of invasive cancer. I think that's the same for prophy mastectomies. I feel it's a CYA thing. I really hated the idea of node removal on both sides, even if it was only one! Too much risk, plus the annoyance then of blood draws, etc. And, to some surgeons, the snb can mean not just one, but several, nodes being removed. Be careful and get all your questions answered on this one. Anne",

The chemo forum will support you so much, and you'll find answers to questions you didn't even know you had! But yeah, you'll lose your hair. Take one step at a time if you can. You will wear yourself out ready and learning and comparing in the coming weeks. But that's normal. Make sure you have a good support system around you, and be sure to give yourself space and time to grieve about this. It's a loss not only of a breast, but of innocence, too.

Hot flashes aren't an issue any more, but if I go off my little dose of drug, the moodiness and tears start up again. If your breast doc isn't comfortable with anti-depressants or anti-anxiety meds, long term or short term, go to your primary. It's what they do. If you don't have a primary, get one that you can feel comfortable with. Hang in there. And don't hesitate to ask for what you need! Anne",

The recent deaths, especially Deb and Annie, and now Twila, have hit me way harder than most of the others. So much suffering, but what an outpouring of love from all the women here, the \"elephant\" girls. I've been focusing on the reconstruction board, because I am not happy with my implants and hope to bite the bullet and go for the DIEP or GAP this spring. I do not relish the thought of a long surgery and a long recovery, but I can no longer tolerate the cold, hard foobs and this perpetual tight band across my chest that makes me feel like I want to rip off a bra (that I don't even wear!) So, I'm deciding between NOLA and Charleston. I love Dr. Massey in Charleston, but it's all day travel from Denver. No direct flight. And if they do the GAP flaps (from the butt area) I really won't want to be sitting very long post-op! (Here's a chuckle for you. I tell my hubby that if they go with the butt tissue for breasts, every time he feels my boobs, he'll be able to say, \"Nice ass, baby!\") I've been busy trying to get this body straightened out. Chiro for neck issues, plus loosening up the mid back that I think is related to implants. And I've had hip pain for 6 months. I'm in PT for that, and I think that's slowly working. I know it's more soft tissue, but like everyone else, I start thinking, \"Is it mets/?\" and I intellectually know it's not, but we do live in perpetual fear! That said, I did just pass my 7 year survival point for my first cancer...so even though I had a new primary a year and a half ago, I count every survival moment I can! Fumi, I love your photos. They are stunning. I thought of you when I was in NZ over Christmas...I had lots of TimTams, and even a TimTam slam! (Most of us would think that was some sort of alcoholic party thing, but it's anything but!) I loved NZ--had a fabulous time there! Enough rambling. I promise not to stay away so long--catching up on all the posting is a tough payback! Hugs to all, Anne",

I'm busy with work and getting ready for big big big surgery May 19. I'm going to Charleston to have my implants removed and then a simultaneous bilateral SGAP reconstruction. I'm blessed to have really good insurance that didn't even blink when getting it approved. And blessed to have a surgeon who takes what TriCare pays, Which to me, isn't nearly enough. I think my current PS has \"fired\" me, but I don't know for sure. He doesn't believe I need this surgery. Granted his handiwork looks good, but feels awful. He is at a loss as to why I'm uncomfortable, and is the analytical type who wants to know WHY something is broken before trying to fix it. reasonable, but not always possible. He sent me to his partner for an opinion about my pain (I had already made up my mind I was going to do the GAP surgery by then) and she and I had a total disconnect in communication. She kept telling me things that were not true about this GAP surgery (she hasn't done any herself, and I've done my research)--and I was saying, \"No, you're wrong,\" and she kept saying \"You're not listening to me!.\" Sheesh. I was so frustrated I nearly cried. I thought I was going to need their support for my insurance approval. (I didn't, ultimately!) I wrote a letter to my PS explaining my frustration, owning my own part of it--wanting them to say what I wanted to hear. Explained that I wasn't trying to burn bridges, that I respected his work and all he's done for me, but that I think the GAP surgery is best. I needed to get a local doc to help me post-op with a check up and drain removals. I asked him and his nurse three times via email and voice mail if they'd help, and there's been nothing but silence. Oh well. My breast surgeon, however, is more than happy to be there for me, even though I haven't seen her in a year and a half. ANYway, it's been a ride, and I've got a lot ahead of me. I found this affirmation today that resonated with me, and I want to share it with you all. Thanks for being here! May today there be peace within.

And who knows what that all translates to be. I would think if you do recon, you're better off with your own tissue that with foreign bodies like implants. I know there's no gurantee about getting PMPS, but given your CRPS history, you certainly are at much higher risk. How on earth do you make this decision? I certainly don't envy you. My best advice is once you examine all potential options, make a choice then don't look back and second-guess yourself. (There are enough people who will do that second-guessing for you, LOL!)

A friend of mine took me to lunch today. He's like a little brother to me, a dear, sweet guy who my hubby and I have seen through a decade of relationships. This means we get to know the girlfriends well, develop strong ties, get lots of stories, then they break up. I usually stay friends with them. But apparently I have said a few things around the new (and I think permanent) girl that were insensitive, and most likely I did overstep my boundaries, unintentionally. So, he wanted to talk to me about it, about her insecurity, etc. Normally, I would have no problem with this, I would be rational and understanding, and contrite. And I guess I was, but I started crying and just couldn't stop. Poor guy, he just held my hand. He reached to hug me, and I spilled my ice water, which did provide for some needed comic relief. I was able then, to figure out what was really going on...I had just gotten back from a quick visit with my PS...I have not once cried about losing my breasts and having to deal with this cancer for a second time. Why it came out now, I'm not sure, but it sure needs to come, and I'm tearing up again as I write this. Wow, I didn't realize I had it so buried. I'm pretty much a stoic person, do what you got to do and move forward. And now, I'm stopped in my tracks. Interestingly, this tearful meltdown coincides with stopping my Zoloft. I had been feeling so darn good lately (except for this damned nerve pain) that I thought maybe I didn't need the med any more. And maybe I don't. But now I feel a deep gash in my psyche that I didn't have to acknowledge before. Just when you think you're moving on, reality smacks you down a bit. But, true to form, I'll lick my wounds for a day or so, then jump back in with both feet. And restart that Zoloft. I think my seratonin needs it.

Good thing I don't have to do this for another 5 years! When we left this house this morning, we had our slider to the kitchen deck open , and the screen cracked for the cats to come and go. We always leave doors open here, plus it's been hot so we love the cool morning air. Well, when we came home, the fridge door was wide open. The floor was dirty. The squeeze bottle of honey was on the floor. Gone to the yard were two large tupperware boxes of cookies, the loaf of bread that had been on the counter, the jar of peanut butter, apples, and some butter. Mr. Bear had made himself at home! Nothing was touched from the fridge, so I think we scared him when we came home! I had to laugh. He unscrewed the jar of peanut butter--a big jar from Costco--but didn't eat much of it. Maybe he isn't fond of \"extra crunchy\" peanut butter! I called some of the neighbors to warn them, then had to be on the lookout, knowing he'll be back at least once for more. And sure enough, I was dozing on the couch when I heard him hit the screen. Both the cat and I bolted upright, and he lumbered away. Now I have a dish of ammonia by the door. That smell really deters the bears. The Division of Wildlife folks say bears can smell food for 3-5 miles. It's a wonder we haven't been hit before. It's been such a dry summer that their usually diet of berries has been poor. Now they're marauding, hitting garbage cans, gardens--and kitchens! I am just amazed that he opened the fridge! His paw print is on the door even! Seems to me he knows what hides in that tall box! I do wish I had a picture of him, but what a feast he must have had--peanutbutter and honey sandwiches with cookies and apples for dessert. He was probably trying to find the milk to wash it all down! Hugs to all, and thanks for the good thoughts regarding the scope! Sheila, should I bring my ABBA cds for our trip to Asheville, so we can sing along? Anne",

If she isn't going to have chemo at her age, then why bother taking out all the nodes. Do the doctors expect this cancer to be what ultimately causes her death, or do they think she's got a greater chance of dying from natural causes, heart diease, etc? Will the extended anesthesia time put her at risk for pneumonia? Or is she otherwise a healthy, active 92 year old who may bounce back fast from surgery? There are many considerations here. It's just not easy to address some of them. But as you read and learn and find out what your mom really wants, it will become clearer. I envy you having your mom still. Mine died of cancer at age 60.

Where I go, I have to fill out a lengthy form, and one question on it is about new lumps or palpable things. Because if there's a palpable mass, they'll do a diagnostic mammo. And if that's inconclusive, they automatically get an ultrasound. Or, at the minimum, the radiologists put a \"disclaimer\" at the end of the mammo report, saying that if the mammo is negative and a lump is felt, the follow up should include such-and-such. Which the docs should note and follow. I had a similar issue a couple years ago. I had a breast MRI (for a problem with my \"good\" breast--calcifications.) The MRI should \"an area of low suspicion\" in a spot that was not near where the calcs were. It recommended a follow-up U/S in 6 months. Well, I had a large excision on the clacs--benign--and that was the end of that.Â  Four years later, that un-followed-up on area was where my second breast cancer lurked. I don't blame anyone for this oversight. I got to keep my breasts a lot longer. But I consider it MY job to keep up on that stuff, so now I keep copies of everything and actually review them from time to time... We must be our own advocates. Good luck with the biopsy, Anne",

He definitely has a sweet tooth. He ate a new jar of peanut butter, a stuck of butter, a loaf of bread, and bag full of frozen pine nuts, and two boxes of ice cream sandwiches! Dirt was everywhere, and the kitties were freaked out. I called the Dept of Wildlife again, and a man came out tonight to set up a pepper spray device, with a rag soaked in honey and bacon grease for bait. We also got some rubber buckshot for our 12 gauge shotgun, in case we get a close look. The DOW guy kind of chastised us for having any doors open at all (crap, it's summer, and hot, and we don't have A/C in the mountains!) But this bear broke down a locked door! I hope this scare tactic works. I'd hate for them to have to trap it and kill it. But it's getting aggressive. This happened to our neighbor two years ago. DOW set a trap. The bear recognized it (we think) and that was the last of the trouble. I'm thinking about borrowing a friend's dog for a while. Maybe that would be enough threat. He's a good sized black bear--I'd guess about 250 pounds. I couldn't tell if he's been tagged as a \"relocated offender\" or not. DOW had to put down a bear in town yesterday, and they got all kinds of bad press and stuff. Boulder is unique in wanting to protect wildlife over people, unless it's in their back yard. That's why town is overrun with plague-infested pririe dogs.\"They're so cute!\" Hmph. Just plain rodents, to me. Anyway, I hope this does the trick. And we'll have to leave deck doors completely shut for a while, not just propped open even a little. Crap.

Towhee, the online book group that I've been a member of for about 10 years has moved to Goodreads. We are Constant Reader. The Goodreads format has changed a lot of things for us, but we're still going strong. Come check us out and join if you'd like! Lisa, you GO girl! no way in hell would I jump out of an airplane. Our local airport recently had a tandem accident. Shit, I didn't mean to spoil your fun. You always know the risks. Same for me and rock climbing. Every time I talk about it, especially after a great experience of pushing my limits on the rock, someone tells me about so-and-so who died climbing. Major downer. Forgive me. You just keep pushing your boundaries and have a blast doing it!! Enjoying a fabulous spring day in the Rockies, Anne",

It stops the ovaries, but sometimes there's extra tissue in our uterus to be shed when we don't ovulate. For some, it's just a trickle. For others, it's like the floodgates opened. If the bleeding seems worse than a normal period (clots, very heavy) you may need an U/S and maybe a D&C. You have had such a terrible time--I ache for you.

He showed me all these \"cracks\" in me teeth (yes, they crack and wear over a half century!) but I wouldn't do it till one tooth started hurting. The last thing I want is a root canal. So, he did two teeth, and it cost about $1500 (insurance actually covered a little!) But still! Oh, and Sheila, let me know how it goes with Earlene in Asheville.

Our bedroom is in the top of our A-frame home, so it gets hot up there. We leave the door to the deck open, and I awaken early to the sound of hummingbirds fighting for the territory of the feeder. We had a long visit with family last week. What's that saying about guests and leftovers being good for about 3 days? Well, this was longer. I felt like, even with gracious help of neices and stepdaughter and sisters-in-laws, that I spent most of my time in the kitchen, either cooking or cleaning or organizing. But I had wonderful time with the granddaughters. It was their first visit to the mountains, and they were thrilled to see the foxes, turkeys, and deer. My poor kitties were really glad to see company leave. They are scaredy boys, and were terrorized by people wanting to pet them. Now, it's back to eating healthy and getting exercise.

First thought was that he'd hurt himself. He's been building a new deck/entry to our house, and before I left ot climb I warned him to be careful with the saw. He has a &quot;history&quot; of getting on the short end of the stick where its concerned at times. Well, sure enough, he was headed to the ER because he cut a couple fingers. One nicked the bone. 13 stitches all together, poor guy. Sigh. I only got to climb a couple routes. I should ahve stayed and climbed, knowing the ER would be a busy place today.

I have to repeat the drinking of a liter of salty stuff 5 hours before my appointment. Said appointment is at 8 a.m!!!! I'll be up and running, so to speak, all night... Just a screening scope. I had a clean one 5 years ago, but have to be vigilant due to family history. Saw Mama Mia at the movies today. (Saw the musical last month!) I LOVED it! Can't wait to see it again and again! I'm a closet ABBA fan--know every word to ervery song. Their songs weight down my mp3 for treadmill music! Go see it! Meryl Streep rocks, and it's the first time I've ever really liked Pierce Brosnan! Hugs to all my girlfriends, Anne",

I'm sorry you're going through this. I'm in health care, too, and have been by the side of many a person with a new cancer diagnosis, or breathing their last breath from cancer. This is not your fate. Not now. Not with great treatment. Not with precious children to live for. Your feeling and fears are what they are. We won't tell you not to be afraid. But we'll encourage you to start treatment. The time is NOW to whack the beast down. Let us help you through this. Anne",

Just the idea of another surgery gives me hives--and so far so good, for me. But you're right--what are we supposed to do? Just suck it up and deal with imperfect foobs, or try to get them as normal as possible--even if it means more surgeries? Take your time. There'sÂ no rush. Anne",

I decided I wanted to watch the screen, so I asked for less meds, to stay awake. Well, let me say that THIS time, I'm going all the way! I don't need to see my colon or feel that pain as the tube rounds the corner ever again! I love versed--such a nice sleep, and no memory of a thing. Â It's the prep that I hate. Window washers are here today. That means it will rain tomorrow and all the pine pollen will spot up my clean windows. Eternal optimist, that's me! Â AE--how does the ophth guy know it's just a mole, and not a melanoma? Are you having viual changes? I know it's probably nothing, but a friend on another board had a melanoma behind her eye--took forever to diagnose it vs mets. Sheesh. I don't mean to worry you needlessly (sorry, I'm sure I did just that!) but do be hypervigilant. Shirlann, happy birthday--late--to you and Walt. How cool. Sue, my dear, and Ulla, and anyone else who finds herself in a dark place, it DOES get better. You have been through hell, and your brain chemistry is totally whacked. Seriously, get on medication to correct this imbalance. You'd do it for any other part of your body! You deserve to feel better! You can't kick bootface till you're mentally strong. By the way, being a latecomer of sorts to this delightful thread, can you tell me the origin of BOOTFACE? Anne",

And those windows! My goodness! We just spent $250 on window cleaning. We have tons of windows, and they are very high, too (A-frame mountain home) so we splurge and let the pros clean them! Sue, I'm wondering if your immune system is so whacked that you have something really funky going on. You ache in muscles and joints, PLUS your joints are swollen?? Make sure the quacky docs draw some blood for an arthritis panel/ lupus panel along with complete blood counts and ESR (also known as sed rate,Â which shows generalized inflammation.) Increase the anti-depressant dose? Chronic (and acute) pain deplete the seratonin even more, so it may seem like the med's not working. Were you on constant doses of steroids during treatment, or just when you had the chemo? Steroid withdrawl can mimic a lot of what you're going through, but it's been 6 weeks, so maybe that's not it. Your body ain't too happy right now, huh? I'm sorry you're suffering like this. Time for me to leave this computer alone and go clean cupboards, so I can restock them. A big bunch of hubby's clan is coming in for the week. I know they'll be helpful once there's here, but in the meantime I must buy groceries, clean the house, wash the towels that have been in storage for ages...plus work, and get in my exercise (which I will NOT push to the side, like usual. This is for ME, dammit!) And, of course, hubby is out of town on business till the day his family starts arriving. Deep breath, Annie! I said I wouldn't get stressed, but I know I am a bit. Oh, well, to the kitchen I go! Have a great day, y'all! Anne",
