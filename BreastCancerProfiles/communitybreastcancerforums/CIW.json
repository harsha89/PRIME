It's not from constipation, diet, etc. I think part of my large intestine is inflamed and anytime anything moves down there in that area I get horrible pain. Like it's not normal. It started after the first round and got so much worse after the second round, so I am honestly scared for this third round. I can handle a whole lot of symptoms, but when I get shooting pains that are so awful I can't even speak I feel like that can't be right. They don't want to do a colonoscopy unless absolutely necessary bc apparently it's risky to do during chemo. I'm not sure what to do about it. Also, yes it is very hard to deal with Lyme disease and chemo at the same time. I have been sick for 3.5 years with Lyme, so when I got diagnosed with cancer too it felt like such a shot to the heart. I hope I do better with taxol. Thank you for sharing your experience.",

      "Content": "CIW wrote: Hey everyone! I have currently finished 2 of 4 rounds of DD AC chemo and will begin 12 weekly taxol treatments after that. AC has been dreadful for me. I get SEVERE lower abdominal pain, extreme fatigue, and nausea/vomiting that lasts the whole two weeks...plus the other standard side effects. I know chemo affects everyone differently and some people only experience AC side effects for 3-5 days, but I experience varying degrees of them the whole time and am pretty sick for at least 9 of the 14 days. I also have late-stage neurological lyme disease which already gives me a lot of fatigue, weakness/faintness, neuropathy, and immunosuppression. It may be partially why AC chemo is so harsh on my body (since my body is already fighting another illness and my side effects are an accumulation of both things). Anywho, I did not come on here to whine about all this, but rather to ask: has anyone else gotten their butt totally kicked by AC chemo but done okay with the weekly Taxol? Was your AC chemo cumulative? How about your taxol? I graduate nursing school this December and come h*ll or high water I am determined to finish. I am just hoping it will get easier with the taxol :-) Dx 7/21/2017, DCIS/IDC, Right, 3cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 8/7/2017 Lymph node removal: Sentinel; Mastectomy: Right Chemotherapy 9/18/2017 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",

It's so scary and the anxiety of waiting for testing can be so hard. I wish I had magic advice on how to get through it, but nothing makes it easy. What helped me when I first got diagnosed, but didn't know how advanced it was was getting outside in nature, going for walks, and being around people I care about. Do you have things that help you when you're feeling anxious? Maybe journaling or some form of distraction? While it's scary and waiting is really hard, I can tell you that you will get through it even if it feels like you can't. Some days are easier and some are harder, but you will get through this yucky, unknown phase. You are not alone. One day at a time. Many good thoughts sent your way.",
