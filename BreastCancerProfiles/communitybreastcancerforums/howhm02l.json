I must get back to work so I'm sorry I can't do personal hellos to everyone now - will stop in again tonight. Tazzy - thank you for the welcome.  Shabby - I am having BMX, and the right side is prophylactic.  My mom was diagnosed at 34, and her sister was 42.  I am 40.  I had decided when they came out with the genetic testing (in 1995, I think) that I would have BMX if I tested positive.  Unfortunately, DCIS was detected on MRI (confirmed with mammorgram and biopsy) before I was able to get the testing done!  I now know that I am BRAC2+ and did not blink at the decision to do BMX.  Although I have to admit that it would be a tougher decision if it were not for the DCIS diagnosis. Omeggo - I'm also planning to hit the gym pretty hard in the next month.  I want to try and be as fit (which is a LONG way off for me - I sit at a desk all day, every day) as possible before surgery, especially if they are able to do my DIEP 2 weeks after the BMX I think it helps with the healing process. Beckers - I LOVE the idea of renting the chair after my DIEP (assuming I do not need rads or chemo after BMX).  I wonder if they could/would take it up stairs to our bonus room . . .",

It rarely goes down as you imagine it will, and if by some fluke it does, you will have lived it twice.\u201d I am not a quotation sort of person and am not at all trying to minimize your concern, but I pass that along because it did help me think that my attempts at preparing myself do not accomplish much.

I had BMX on 8/16 and am scheduled for DIEP on Thursday, 8/30. I am also 40. Cottontail - best wishes. I will be praying for you. We go the same day. Deader - welcome! I share your thoughts on the drains - absolute loathe them. I still have 1 from my BMX on the 16th and will be getting 4 drains again on Thursday when I have DIEP reconstruction. Ugh!",

Omeggo and Shabby - I was planning to step up my gym efforts -(from 3 to 5 days each week) to assist with recovery, but my precious 4 year old graciously shared her cold, and the congestion and cough have completely wiped me out. I have to admit that I have not thought too much about the 16th. Like Sahbby, I am worried most about the following week and the pathology results. Now, I am trying to get things wrapped up at work, we go on vacation to the beach the week of the 5th, school starts soon, etc. I am very grateful to have those distractions. I think it helps makes the time pass by more quickly. Plus, because I am BRCA2+ and have an increased risk for Ovarian cancer, I have an ultrasound on Friday to make sure all is well there. The gynecological oncologist has recommended that ovaries, tubes, uterus, and cervix all come out once the beast cancer issue is under control. The BMX is not as scary to me as removing everything else. I am only 40 (never thought I would say that!) and fear menopause and the loss of sex drive. No one in my family has ever had ovarian cancer so I don't fear it as much as I have always feared breast cancer, but since there are no symptoms and no wall way to screen, I do not feel like I can risk waiting too long.

Anyway, I am interested in how many women who were younger than 40 had a family history and whether the BRCA test had been recommended prior to your diagnosis. Even with my positive BRCA2 test, my DCIS diagnosis, and out mother and aunt's BC, my sister's ob/gym office was completely clueless in how to get her tested. They still haven't figured out how to ask for \"short form\" test to see if she is positive for my mutation. I had the genetic counseling a few years ago and just had not done the testing yet in part out of concern that the results would make me uninsurable. I know I am fortunate that a routine MRI caught my tumor at the DCIS stage, and I had the MRI done as part of my routine screens. I have had mammograms since I was 24. I wonder how many people with family history are being told about BRCA testing by their regular ob/gyns? I know that my daughter, who is now only 4 years old, will need to get tested at some point, maybe 18? I am sorry for the rambling - thanks for listening.",
