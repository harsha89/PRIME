IsÂ it true that your breast has to heal from the biopsy before you can have a lumpectomy? I'm hoping so as the timing would be better for me, but I will do whatever the doc says. My other question: I have to have a second biopsy on an area the radiologist couldn't get to. The surgeon will do it. If it's positive, will he have to go back in? Or should he just biopsy it, wait for the results and then do the two areas at once? Anybody been down this road and know? Thanks! These are such helpful discussion boards.
