    "Content": "Feb 8, 2016 11:52PM - edited Feb 9, 2016 12:04AM by Conspiracy-theorist I have an appointment with the oncologist tomorrow for a three month follow up after an excisional biopsy which confirmed ADH. During the process from screening mammogram through US and stereotactic biopsy MRIs and 8 more mammograms, I felt like the victim of a conspiracy of the medical industry. My primary care doc, whom I love dearly, handed me off to a surgeon and an oncologist who seemed hell bent on doing whatever they could to make my calcificationsturn into cancer. The anxiety of the process as the basis of my first conspiracy theory that they were trying to worry me into being sick. But, I rejected it as being just too evil. My next theory was that it was a plot to defraud Medicare by ordering procedure after procedure and involving the two specialists. I still feel that this theory has merit. My plan is to call a stop to this tomorrow. I have one more mammogram and visit with the surgeon in May and I will comply with that. I will do the annual mammograms and continue taking the estrogen inhibitor even though I have had some nuisance side effects. Unless they get worse, I will take it. The research I have done makes cutting the estrogen connection seem logical. Each time I have visited the oncologist there is a many page questionnaire assessing my anxiety level so she knows that she is creating it. I'm all for maximizing breast cancer research until a real cure and prevention that works is found. But, I also wish that this low level breast condition would not trigger an all out onslaught of testing and procedures. For now, I have a daily pill and an odd Harry Potter scar to remind me of the several months of torture. I wish I could somehow prevent anyone else from having to endure it   ",
