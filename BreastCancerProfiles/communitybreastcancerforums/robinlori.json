I am concerned about the tightness that I have heard about around the chest after surgery. I will not have tissue expanders so will the tightness be less? I have severe GERD and cannot tolerate wearing bra because it aggravates my symptoms. I am worried that the chest tightness will aggravate my GERD symptoms as well. Thanks for your response!
