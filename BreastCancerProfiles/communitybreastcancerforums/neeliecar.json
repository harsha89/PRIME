God I hope so,as I am tired of my nose dripping all the time.  eileen",

      "Content": "neeliecar wrote: I had a double mastectomy four (4) weeks ago and the pain I am having is about the same as it was at the beginning.  I had expander reconstruction done.  I feel like a vise is clamped onto my chest and there is still burning all around the area that the tissue was taken out.  I tried cutting down my pain killers to 1 in the morning, 1 in the afternoon, and two at night at bedtime.  Only one didn't seem to help.  My surgeon said that my body still needs the pain killers and to go back to two each time.  She said she would rather see me more active and in less pain, than taking less pain killers and sitting around to avoid the pain.  My plastic surgeon acts like I should have been off the pain killers long ago.  I am getting very depressed being in pain 24 hrs a day and I don't know if this is normal or what to do about it.  I did have a saline injecion this week which made things somewhat worse, but most of this pain was there before the injection.  The percocets only take the edge off and never completely get rid of the pain.  I don't know how much more I can take.  Is this normal and has anyone else had this same problem? Thanks for any input and encouragement you can give me. Eileen Eileen (neeliecar) - Don't plan for tomorrow, live for today!
