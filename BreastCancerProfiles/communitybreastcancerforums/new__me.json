Because i am having TEs put in right away she said the SN cannot be checked easily in the future because of implants.i thought of opting out of it but my husband and i decided it is a bit of insurance ... in the event cancer is found SNs are ready. I am just so tired of all of this. because of the brca2 i underwent a total hysterectomy last month. I always planned to have ovaries removed in my 60s like my mom did because her mother died of ovarian c at 67. We never heard of brca until a few years ago and a few months ago found we (sisters and mom) are all brca2. My mom beat the odds. Is now almost 90 and never developed cancer. Maybe having ovaries out helped that. Nevertheless my sisters developed bc before they were planning ovarian removal. If i could somehow know if i had my mom's health and will beat the odds as well i wouldn't have the surgery but common sense pushes me to it. My first grandchild is due in Feb after which my daughter will have the brca test and we will learn if the mutation lives on. Her OB urged her not to get tested now... it would be stressful. We just learned of my brca2 a few months ago and still reeling from it. Hopefully my surgeries will be finished after my implants. (The exchange surgery date in March is tentative but likely) ",

It was a very difficult decision to make. My breasts fed my babies until they were two. Breastfeeding was a very important part of my life and i was a LaLeche League member. My daughter is pregnant with my first grandchild due in a few months and she is preparing to breastfeed. It is so bittersweet. I know i will really miss my original breasts when i see her nurse the baby and i will be left with fake breasts that have no feeling and are hard (at least until after my exchange surgery in Spring) . In Sept i also underwent a total hysterectomy , ovaries, tubes, uterus, cervix. I am losing all my female parts and it is very sad. But the tradeoff is LIFE! ",

My PBM was one month ago and i am finally starting to feel like i am healing. It has taken this long for my incisions to finally shed the glue and scabs. I am an insulin dependent diabetic and wounds sometimes take a little extra time. I had my first fill last week (100cc each) now i am at 350cc each side. Next fill in a week. Not too much discomfort. A bit sorevfor a few days. Hoping next fill goes as well. I want to tell everyone how special my husband has been through all of this. He has emptied my drains and checked the incisions each day. We both lost our jobs two years ago due to downsizing and have exhausted our unemployment benefits. It has brought us closer and now my brca2 finding brought us even closer after 38 yrs of marriage. We are clinging to each other and trying to make ends meet. Praying that God will guide us as He always has. Jobs are scarce in our area, especially when you are 60 and 62. But we do feel blessed that my PBM was clear. Even with an 85% chance of getting breast cancer i beat the odds. For that we are most thankful. Please remember us in your prayers.",

It has been uneventful and i am ready for this next step. I think my righy TE has a slow leak. I have 450cc in left and PS keeps adding to right (now at 625cc!) but it never gets bigger and still looks smaller than left. PS said he won't know what is going on until he opens me up. So because the right is still a bit smaller he will probably fit the implant (gummi) to that side and take the excessive tissue out of the left so they 'match' meaning i will be smaller than anticipated. I am disappointed but remind myself it is better than nothing. I will also have fat grafts to smooth out areas. I finally got around to reading the BMX pathology report. It shows that my left breast had several suspicious areas and a specific area of ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia) that was 3cm very deep in my breast. So thankful i decided to go ahead with the PBMX. My dr said it would have become cancer and with my brca2 mutation it would have gone fast (like both of my sisters). Now of course i am worried that something might still pop up in the future ... what if the surgeon didn't remove all the breast tissue she should have? PS said i seem to have alot of tissue left on that side ... is it breast tissue? Argh! It (worry) never ends does it?",

I can bear 24 hrs of pain but only if i know it will subside. I am so afraid of not being able to manage pain levels for days and days. Your post gave me some comfort. I think i will be able to handle it. Is the muscle painful where it stretches over the TE? How much fill did you get? How are the drains?",

This is my week (friday) and i am trying to find inner peace i know worrying robs your body of healing strength and at this poiny everything moves along on autopilot anyway. Too late for should have or if only's ... i know it is not mine to control. I just pray that cancer isn't found and that the SNBs are cleaar. Good luck to those of you yet to go in, and loads of warm hugs, things to laugh about and chocolate kisses to you ladies who are tecovering Love you ladies... you have kept me informed and positive.

My PBMX was a few days before Thanksgiving last fall and i was actually feeling well enough to join the extended family at the dinner table. Pretty unique excuse to get out of helping with cooking etc :) pleasr don't worry about surgery. You will wake up in recovery with your chest tightly bandaged and will feel as if a huge burden has been lifted! It is over! Life can begin again. In my case it was preventative and i knew i would not have to experience bc like my 2 sisters did. I wish you speedy recoveries. The first 24 hours are the hardest trying to shake off the anesthesia. Pain was easily managed with Advil in my case. Even the TEs were tolerable and each day is better than the previous one. Enjoy resting and letting others take care of you, and remeber... no using your arms if you can help it. I will keep you in my prayers. See you on the other side ! Diane",

Soon it will be just a blip in the stream of your life. You will have new younger boobs to lead you on (lol depending on your implant size the new boobs might be far ahead of you .

There may be a few weepy rough patches when you stop and realize your breasts are gone but if you accept it and let the feelings just go through you and out the back and keep looking forward you will be on the way to your nsew you. Yes you are as a caterpillar preparing to transform. There is a real beauty in the process if you let yourself experience all the feelings that flow through you. And above all know you made the right decision and never look back. Breast cancer will not claim you as a victim. By undergoing the prophylactic mastectomy we took a stand against bc and showed we are more powerful and we refuse to wait for it to show up. My sister never knew she was brca2+ and her bc came back over and over until it killed her. My second sister was diagnosed 7 months ago and found out she is brca2+ and has a very aggressive bc. Praying it was found in time. I tested brca2+ right after she did and i wasted no time getting my medical team together. I have no regrets and feel blessed that i had a choice. My mother carries the brca2 mutation but bc has not found her yet. She is 90 and healthy. Love and hugs ... Diane",

They are a major nuisance and probably the worst part of this surgery. My husband took over the whole drain part. it gave him a job to do that helped me. He emptied then measured output, kept a chart, and tucked them back into my camisole. So sweet. I hope you are comfortable and resting. Soon (in a few weeks) you will begin the TE fills. Do not dread these. They did not hurt and I found it fascinating to watch them expand a little more each time. As i said before there is beauty in every step of this transformation. Rather than wishing this be over, embrace each change, every step. You are becoming a new you! Blessings, Diane",
