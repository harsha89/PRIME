Onc. said doxil does not cause hair loss, yesterday during infussion I heard one of the nurses saying that it does causes hair loss. Anyone who's been on doxil, I appreciate your experience with this drug, any side effects, etc. Anything I can learn, please. Thank you for your time.  Adi. Log in to post a reply",
