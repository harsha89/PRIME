Not knowing what is coming and knowing the cancer is in you still is scary. I\u2019ll be thinking of you and praying for you in this difficult time. We will get through this one step at a time.",

It\u2019s frustrating because it\u2019s hard to get regular results usually. I don\u2019t know how to compare wait times with a military hospital to civilian. I\u2019m concerned that they felt the need to biopsy the lymph node immediately. I have very large dense breasts and I\u2019m afraid that this could have been going on a long time without me knowing. @beach2beach - Thank you. Since I\u2019m confident they were probably not working on the weekend. Then maybe these results will come tomorrow. I just have never had a test take this long to get back. I\u2019ve had a lot of nonCancer related surgeries over the years.  ",

Unfortunately, I can\u2019t attribute the delay to weather. Maybe the holidays. But even then the hospital is open through the holidays. I\u2019m not panicking. I\u2019ve accepted that I have BC. My breast is hard like a rock and it has a 2cm lump you can feel. It happened very suddenly. I also was distressed from the reaction of the radiologist and techs. I just want some answers so I can have a double mastectomy and get the camera out of my body before it spreads further. I\u2019m very concerned about the lymph node involvement",

I've spent the last couple of months very sick off and on with nausea and dirreah so I'm fearing the worst. Especially, becuae of the inflamed lymph node. It makes me terrified and Im having a much more difficult time handling this than Ithought I would since it's very fast and very sudden.",
