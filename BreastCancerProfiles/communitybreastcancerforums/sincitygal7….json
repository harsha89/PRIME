It seems like the Dr. is being proactive, which is a good thing ;) While there may not be anything serious going on, it's better to get it checked out and make sure. Hopefully it is nothing, and if it is something we are all here for ya.",

I am sure it is very worrisome for you and just wanted you to know we are here for you. I hope that your mother gets b9 results, but you should prepare yourself for the worst just in case. A BIRAD 5 is highly suggestive of malignancy. Radiologists are trained professionals who see this kind of stuff everyday, but only a biposy can determine whether or not cancer is present. In the meantime, try to keep your mind busy although I know it is easier said than done! Hopefully you get answers soon, and then can determine what the next steps will be, should there be anything. Please keep us posted. :)",
