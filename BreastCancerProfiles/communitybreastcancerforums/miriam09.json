This is my first post, but I´ve been reading a lot on this wonderful homepage. My mom got diagnosed with IDC, Stage 1, Grad 2 in April and since her oncotype test was 56 she started with chemo in July, after her lumpectomy. Today I want to share some good news about my mom´s chemo with y´all. She had her 2nd AC treatment on Wednesday. Because they gave her way too much Phenergan (anti-nausea med) after the 1st cycle, I needed to bring her to the er. So this time she was really worried and scared. But I can tell you she is doing great! They adjusted her dosage and she didn´t get nauseaous, didn´t throw up, has great appetite, can eat everything and is not too too tired. She is up and running and we took a ride across town today. Also the Neuprogen shots don´t give her any problems. Her spirits are high! She took us girls to two different wig places and we all got two wigs and went to a bar afterwards wearing them! She made it fun not only for herself but also for us! Sure, shaving her head on Sunday evening was the hardest, most heartbreaking thing I ever had to do, but again she was very strong and we both didn´t cry. She tries really hard to keep a positive attitude, even though it´s hard sometimes. But she always says she doesn´t want to go to the \"dark place in her mind\" and calls me up every time she thinks she might get there. So I can distract or cheer her up. I wish y´all that you can keep your positive attitude up! Mom (and some of you too) will be halfway through AC in 2 weeks and we will surely celebrate that! :-) Hope y´all will do that too! Big hugs!",
