      "Content": "NadineT wrote: hi everyone, I\u2019m a 38 year old mother (daughter is 9 years old), and my right breast has been hurting me for a month. Saw the gynaecologist as soon as the pain started and she said it was nothing, couldn\u2019t feel any lumps, but better have an MRI due to family history.Breast MRI came back clear, so she told me to take painkillers. It\u2019s been a month and there\u2019s no improvement. I feel the pain in my breast, the breast feels heavy and the pain sometimes spread to the armpit, arm, and collarbone. I\u2019m worried because both my mom and her sister died from breast cancer. Could this be the start of IBC? THank you everyone Log in to post a reply",
