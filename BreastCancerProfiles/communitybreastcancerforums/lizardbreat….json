And I wanted to add that I hope my first post did not sound too... optimistic or chirpy or whatever.  I hope not.  I just wanted to post to say \"it went ok.\" Thank you, all, and I'll keep reading.  P.S.  Jax and gp, good to hear that you made it with the veins.  YAY. You'll be my models (and my mom, who is now into T and herceptin with no port, knock wood and thank God). P.S.S.  Keep up the good work bellydancer.",
