Hopefully my drains will come out tomorrow. I'm getting less than 2cc out every eight hours. Looking forward to that. I got filled to 200 cc on the table but my doctor will wait until the 24th of June before the first fill. I'm hoping to go to a small C, I was a medium D before, but at this point I don't care. Are your TE's really tight and super hard? Also, I'm itching pretty bad where the incisions are. I'm still on antibiotics until Sunday and so far no infection. I also got clean nodes so no ancillary treatment, I just need to heal. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has to go through more treatment...I can't imagine.",

Not sure if that makes sense, but helps explain (to myself) why I have so much anxiety.",

I have been so busy with work and life that from diagnosis in mid February to now I've just been trying to \"keep the wheels on\". I spent a few weeks interviewing doctors and more than that on research. I finally made my decision and thought that I was fine. Then, last night when I got home from work, in the mail was a letter from my insurance company. I've been getting approval letters every day for some aspect of the procedure (note here that I am EXTREMLEY pleased with my insurance and thank My husbands employer for providing a truly terrific plan...I am not complaining about insurance). The procdure name always seems a little obscure to me, but this one was horrific, at least to me. It says the procedure is \"Trunk Muscle relocation and Skin Graft\". I know what this is, as the PS explained it to me, but it seems so barbaric when I look at the words. Needless to say, that during dinner with my husband, I just started crying. Then sobbing. I tried to explain it to him, and he was consolatory but didn't understand my reaction. I'm posting here because I know that you guys \"get it\". Thanks for letting me vent....patiently waiting for May 23rd.",

So I turned towards the mirror and like you, teared up but didn't cry. Since then I have looked at them in privacy and am ok. I was a full d cup before, and had not had kids. My original boobs were pretty incredible. My PS said they would never look that way again, so I'm prepared (I think!). I'm going to fill to a small C which is the best the dr thinks we can do and I'm fine with that. I just keep saying No Cancer!!!!! Hang in there.",

Sleeping is still a huge issue. I'm sleeping propped up, on my back. Can't go to either side yet. So, like everyone has said, sleeping bag? Probabley not, but a trailer or RV, with a comfy bed might work. I have good days, and not so good days. My TE's are tight, and I have so many different bras and they all chaff my skin. My PS makes me wear a bra 24/7 so it is really just uncomfortable, but not pain. Good luck, come back and let us know how you do!",
