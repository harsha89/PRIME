Is this normal and will it fall out.  HELP!  I have to go back to work on 9/1 and I don't want to look like I need a shave!! LOL!!  I use to have a little hair before the chemo down the sides, but now it seems to be all over the face.  I am really rather freaked out by this.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks, Jayne",
