If they don't mind used! One is the Amoena Allison 2861 size M A/B. It has Velcro front and also inner Velcro pockets for drains. The other one was given to me by my breast clinic. Size small. It has hidden velcro pockets for drains too but it has to be slipped over the head and that was HARD for awhile. Message me if interested",

I have had non stop shoulder and neck pain since my recon in 2015. I had frozen shoulder in 2016, got that resolved and now neck pain so bad I am in massage therapy every two weeks and have some really bad days. I just wonder when and if it will ever end. I was lucky and found my DCIS early so no radiation, no chemo. I should be healthy and happy but this pain along my shoulder blade up my neck is debilitating most days! I am tired of my primary care doc sending me to a pain doc. He just wants me on medicine and no long term solutions. I am going to keep following this thread.",
