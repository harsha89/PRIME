Your situation sounds very promising. Mine is probably a little higher risk, as I'm older and my mammo report seemed inconsistent with my biopsy report. But I'm trying to stay hopeful! Surgeon said go on vacation, wait for genetic results, try to relax. :)",

You already have a cancer hospital, doctors, genetic testing, that's all so helpful. I went through a few biopsies and scary test results recently and all was benign, to my surprise... I think we tend to prepare ourselves for the worst for the sake of being prepared. I sure did! I bet you are ready for the appointment and will get plenty of info. the only thing I can think of to ask is about your general risk based on the genetics and your personal history, age, etc.. Just to help plan for the future assuming this is all benign. They might want to change your schedule for mammograms or add additional screening, etc.. Good luck!",
