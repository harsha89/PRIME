I started chemo on January 20 and I have a LONG haul until June.  So - I'm here now and reading through the previous posts to have some company along the way.  I have met many survivors and have a good group of friends who (unfortunately) are survivors also.  But, none of my personal contacts have followed the same path, or they went through chemo long enough ago that things have changed. Here's my deal -  48 yrs, Mastectomy 11/08; ALD 12/08; Chemo - Adriamycin  & Cytoxan 4x every 3 wks followed  by  12 weekly Taxol treatments.  Participating in a blind Avastin study. I am happy to answer any questions and/or provide comments related to recovery and treatment. Can anyone comment on the following:  I am going to go from A&C to Taxol for the last 12 weeks - I would like to know if patients note differences and if so, what are they?  I have this baby-like hair all over my head - does anyone else have this & will the rest fall out with the new drug?  This hair never fell out, is all over my head, and is oddly not gray, not my dyed hair and not my natural color.  Strands are one consistent color - light strawberry blonde.  I sheared my hair to about an inch went it started to fall out.  The hair is about an inch long - it's not new hair, but I can't tell if it's growing. I have had hot flashes  - not like menopause flashes - they are quick and just make me hot, not sweaty - do I have a virus or is this usual?  No period since pre-chemo - which I know is normal - will it come back?  Chemo is supposed to force menopause - what's that like?  I expected to have normal periods for about 7-8 more years based on family history. I felt absolutely great on the day that I went to have my 3rd treatment and was stunned to find out that my count was too low for chemo.  I had the treatment two days later followed by a Neulasta injection the following day.  It took me a few days longer to rebound after this treatment and the leg pains from the Neulasta are still with me.  I still think that maybe I have a bit of a virus - the hot flashes only started a few days ago.  I do not and have not had a fever. Many thanks to all who contribute and even though we are all in this together - doesn't this just suck? LM",

LadyJane54 - I feel for you.  I just realized that my license will require a new photo this year.  In the larger picture, this is so minor.   But, I don't love the love the idea of having and having to show a wig photo of me for the next couple of years.  You have to jump through hoops to get a new photo - and I just long for the days when I don't think about anything related to BC. Chemo is great for helping to screw up any sense of planning.  Just when you think you have the gist - your count is low, a new procedure is added, the side effects change - lovely, isn't it? I was able to get away to warm weather in the 3 week break between AC #3 & #4.  I have learned to deal with the wig on the East Coast, but yesterday in the heat - I carefully considered ripping the the thing off of my head while at an outdoor art fair.  I couldn't go sans wig without a scarf or hat - sunburn.   So, I managed to wait until I made it to the car - air on high, wig off, my head directed at the vent.  I echo the need for summer headwear that doesn't look Pilgrim-like. Notice that we worried about survival in the fall, recovery from surgery when the seasons changed and now it's all chemo all of the time. LM ",

(BTW: I know the port is convenient, but the idea of a foreign object under my skin makes my skin crawl. If I accidentally touch the bump, it's like nails on a chalkboard.)  I fantasize that I am in Arm B - best of both worlds - got the drug and didn't have to invest more time.  I hope April 30 is a great day for you! I didn't see anything on this, but I may have missed it.  A survivor told me to use Rogaine for Women on my eyebrows.  One Q-tip swabbed across each eyebrow twice a day.  Rogaine is expensive, but one small bottle for only eyebrows should be all that is needed.  I already have such a long list of \"thing to do\" - lotions, sunscreen, etc. - adding one more thing to the list wasn't that bad.
