I also have a slight swelling under my arm which may just be a blocked gland I haven't slept and am very worried . I have a 4 year old adopted daughter , she's very hard work and I am stressed quite a bit of the time and with this I am feeling worse . It's sat am here and easter weekend so can't get a docs appointment till Tuesday. This side of my body is a weaker side - achy shoulder due to constant Sinus issues so I may be being a bit paranoid . I have weekly back neck and shoulder massages to help sinus drainage in my head, neck and shoulders which does help at lot. Could the armpit be due to a blocked gland - I have had this before and it's gone away I feel otherwise healthy but now just very concerned . Log in to post a reply",
