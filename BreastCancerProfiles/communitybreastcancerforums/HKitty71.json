I was told I would be off of work for a week, I did ask how soon I would be able to starting working (like moving a mouse for a living is heavy) and I was told no weight lifting. But looking at some of these I am pretty nervous now. I really did not have any pain with the biopsy just could not sleep on my stomach (I had seen some of my friends pretty beat up so to speak after theirs, and lucky for them they were all non cancerous) so I was really hoping that this would be similar experience. ",

I had a bad experience with the original surgery in April. Had a lumpectomy and developed a nasty seroma(sp) which lead to so much fluid building up that well it pretty much blew out the incision. Please keep in mind this does not happen to a lot of people just a few of us but the drains while a total nuisance are a good tool, just a pain to drag around. They do add an extra 10 minutes or more to getting ready. ",

Pain in the butt.  I quit smoking 2 weeks prior to my mastectomy on the 23rd or May ( I was a 2 pack a day girl for a long time). I hate to say I am glad I did, I am healing so much better than I did when I smoked during the lumpectomy in April. Not smoking really helps with the healing. Heck it also gives you something else to focus on besides the breast cancer and the circus that seems to surround it. I also gained weight on top of my chubbiness I ate to cope. You are in my hopes and prayers as are all of the ladies on these boards. We are in it together.  ",
