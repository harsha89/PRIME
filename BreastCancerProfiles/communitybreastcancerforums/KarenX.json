I was pretty vulnerable, scared, and weak...still recovering from surgery.  I posted this as therapy for myself, and as a warning to other women. My radiologist told me the manufacturers of MammoSite stopped marketing it to radiologists because they weren't interested until more clinical trials are done. She said they started marketing it to surgeons who love it because it's quick, easy money, and women's magazines. I am not saying it is a bad procedure, but in my case, it was not the right option for me. But that didn't stop the brachytherapy center or the surgeon from trying to sell it to me. Trust me...once I am done with that doctor, he will be lucky if he still has a job. All of the waiting has been awful!!!!! I am still on target for treatment, but I should be further along by now.  I need to post my \"stats:...no lymph involvement, Her2/neu-, estrogen and progesterone positive. ",

      "Content": "KarenX wrote: I need to release my anger and put this behind me, so I am going to do it here. I was diagnosed with Stage 2 IDC on November 13th. I had a lumpectomy on November 30th. On December 13th, I had a follow-up with the surgeon, and he referred me to a radiologist who is also a medical oncologist. The surgeon thought I was a candiate for MammoSite, and it sounded intriguing, so I was interested. I scheduled an appointment, I thought to talk to the radiologist/oncologist about my treatment options. But when I got there, it was all about MammoSite. The measured my cavity and declared me a candidate, but something didn't feel right. The doctor I saw was not a radiologist, and he never told me about the other radiation options. I asked him some questions, based on what I'd read about MammoSite. My specific concern was I'd read that MammoSite can deliver more radiation to the heart than beam radiation for tumors clost to the chest wall. That was a big concern because the tumor was in my left breast. He told me MammoSite would deliver less of a dose to the heart than beam radiation, but something still didn't seem right...it felt like a sales job instead of a consultation. I told a friend of mine about the visit (a breast cancer survivor), and she was so alarmed, she emailed by pathology report to her oncologist. Her oncologist said MammoSite could make my breast very hard because of the size of my tumor (2.2 cm), and I should talk with medical oncologist and get a second opinion on radiation before I made any decision. By this time, my surgeon's office was closed for the holidays, and I was so frustrated, it didn't occur to me to contact my primary care doctor for a referral.  So...i had to wait until after the holidays to see an oncologist....in the meantime, the surgeon and the brachytherapy center were still pushing MammoSite, and had me scheduled to insert the catheter the day after my apppointment with the oncologist.  I told the oncologist everything the brachytherapy doctor told me, and how I felt I was being pressured by him and the surgeon to do MammoSite. She  picked up the phone and got me an appointment with a radiologist the next day.  She also ordered the Oncotype DX test for me and schedule me for a PET scan...finally, some movement in the right direction. So, I go to talk with the radiologist, and she spent an hour and a half with me explaining the pros and cons of all my radiation options. She said she would not recommend MammoSite for me because of the size and location of my cavity, close to the chest wall. She said MammoSite could make my breast hard, and potentially deliver a higher dose to my heart than beam radiation. Furthermore, she said she only uses MammoSite in rare cases because it is still in clinical trials. Exactly the opposite of what the brachytherapy doctor told me. I decided not to do MammoSite, but I am still angry about the sales job they tried to do on me.  I told the surgeon that that brachytherapy doctor totally lied to me, and I am going to file a complaint against him. I am going to get another surgeon for my follow-up care too.  I have a good team with my oncologist and my new radiologist, and finally things are getting done. Still...I feel like all the waiting was needless, if I had gotten the right referrals from the beginning.  Log in to post a reply",

That I don't know, but I will find out. My radiologist told me he came out of retirement to join the brachytherapy practice when the oncologist's other partner left. She also said that he may NOT be as aware of modern radiation techniques, so perhaps he shouldn't be seeing any patients, right? I didn't trust him or his manner...I could tell he wasn't being completely honest.",
