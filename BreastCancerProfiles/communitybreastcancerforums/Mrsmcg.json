I have to be at the hospital at 9:30 tomorrow for the nuclear node mapping.I am not really sure what to expect for this portion of the day. Today my PS said that I had asked about staying overnight. I said I was just wondering what my chances were. He said that if I am still sick a couple of hours post surgery, that the he will check with the recovery nurse and tell them to let me stay. He said that there is an observation area next to the OR, and I can go home Saturday morning. If I am as sick as I normally get post surgery, I would prefer to stay overnight. Praying that all goes smoothly tomorrow and that I won't experience too much pain.",

After I've walked around for a bit if feels okay. I'm pretty sure that my drain will come out at my follow up appointment on Tues. The drain could probably come out sooner, but There seems to be very fluid in the bulb. I just figured there is no point in the trying to get in to the dr a day early. Walking laps around our house whenever I get up seems to help. Linda2119 - I'm sure you will so well next week. When you feel up to it post here to let us know how you are doing.",

She said I needed to stretch that area, as I am getting what she calls cobwebs - scar tissue that needs to be stretched. I told her that the PS was not wanting me to do this type of stretching yet. She said that she would defer to him. I asked about PT. She didn't think it was needed, but said she would defer my PS, as she didn't want to get in trouble with him. I asked the PS about these questions in a follow up email, and he said that he would defer to my BCS! Well, this is confusing! I'm not sure what to do, as I have been trying to gently stretch my left arm over my head, and it's feels tight, and painful. When I lower my arm, my whole arm feels tired, all the way up to my shoulder. This is discouraging. :( I am scheduled to have the massage with my usual massage therapist on April 19th, but now I am not sure if I should cancel the appointment. Will I be able to lie flat on on my chest by then? Will it be too painful? These are just a a few of the things that are going through my head. I guess I just need to stop over thinking everything. Lol! :) I have another follow-up appointment with my PS next Thursday and my radiology CT simulation scheduled for next Friday. So everything is moving forward. I have still not returned to work. My return to work will be reevaluate next week by my PS. I hope and pray that all March surgeries went well.

I was diagnosed with IDC, Grade 1 (total score 3/9). I to am scheduled to have the node mapping prior to surgery. I will be having a lumpectomy with bilateral mammoplasty (breast reduction and lift). Also known as oncoplastic. I am getting anxious and just want the surgery to be over with. The Dr. told me that there is only a 20 to 30% chance that I will stay overnight. I am thinking my chances might be greater than that, as I am usually pretty sick post surgery. My procedure is at 2pm. I am told that the PS will take 3 hours, and that the BC has to do her thing too. So I am guessing that will add maybe another 45 mins to an hour. Not sure how long a lumpectomy and SNB takes. Then there are several hours of recovery. So, I likely won't even be ready to go home until about 9pm. I don't know if it is normally or not, but over the last couple of days I have started to feel some sadness... that after surgery I am not going to be the same person anymore. I know that's not true, just a part of my body will be different, but it still bothers me. I will be off for 2 weeks, and going back to work 1/2 time on the third week. I can do light duty (desk work), but even my desk work requires a lot of upper body movement, so this really concerns me. I don't want to risk lymphedema, or compromising my recovery by going back to work too soon. My problem is that I have a limited amount of sick leave left, and will have to have weeks of radiation after my incisions have healed. How do I get my information to display at the bottom of my messages? I added the information to my profile, but it must be something else, as doing that didn't work. I wish everyone in this group all the best in their recovery or upcoming surgery.",

The Ps said that my one breast gave him a lot of of challenges due to the amount of tissue the BCS removed. He said that he almost had to do a nipple graft, but was he was able to avoid it. He said he had to pull the nipple a little to the left, so it isn't exactly centered, but he said that could be addressed later if it's an issue. He said the blood supply is there, but diminished, so he prescribed me some nitroglycerin cream. This is supposed to help increase the blood flow to that area. He explained that not every pharmacy has it, so I had to use a different pharmacy than the one I normally use. The ps checked the other incisions and said everything looks good. I did develop a couple of blisters around the edge of some of the tape. He explained that this is normal for some people. Oh, my ps also told me that I can wear a front closure bra now, and I don't need to have any additional padding. My breasts are really bruised, swollen, but the pain level has been very tolerable. I am only taking Tylenol. I have been sleeping in a recliner. A neck pillow has been pretty helpful. The first night I didn't think I would need it and woke up with a bit of a sore neck. After the appt my friend took me to pick up the prescription, and the place didn't have it ready yet. They said it would be like 45 minutes. I figured we could go back later. I came home, rested a bit, took a real shower, and then I DROVE back to the pharmacy. They said they were out of stock, and wouldn't have it until after 1pm tomorrow. I drove home, and have just been getting some rest after my busy day. A day of firsts: 1st day without a drain; 1st shower; 1st time driving. I have my next follow up appointment in a week. At that time I will ask my Ps if he feels I am ready to go back to work, as my job requires a lot of upper body /arm movement, as well as repeative lifting. Wishing everyone going through surgery the best, and everyone who is healing a speedy recovery! Colleen    ",

I had a lumpectomy for ADH in the left breast last year, and 6 months later they discovered 5mm of IDC during my regular 6 month follow up MRI mammogram. I had 2 consultations with breast cancer surgeons, and both felt that mastectomy was not necessary. I opted to have a lumpectomy with oncoplastic (mammoplasty), which is a breast reduction with lift. I had my surgery on March 16th. I am very happy with my decision. My recovery has been going pretty well. I did have a SNB as well, and no cancer was found. I also need to have radiation. I will discuss this with my BCS tomorrow at my post op appt. I had my 2nd post op appt with my PS today, 3/27/18. It looks like I will be off for another week. Return to work will be reevaluated on 4/5. The dr. asked how I was doing, and I said fine, but that my desk work is a lot of repetitive upper arm movements. He said to give it another week. He removed all of the remaining surgical tape and said that the left side is still pretty bruised. He said he had to work all sorts of magic on the left side. He explained to me that he had to removed bit of the areola, in order to save the nipple. I hadn't known about that. He said that the color was looking good, so I could stop using the Nitro-Bid. The PS said that it is going to take extra time to heal. The PS said to not be surprised if the left side remains swollen and hard for while. I have noticed that thr right side has be softening up a bit. He mentioned that I could start putting vitamin E cream on the scars. He wants to see me weekly until I start radiation. Just know that you are not alone. We're here for you. Feel free to send me a PM anytime. You will be in my thoughts and prayers! It area I am having the most trouble with is still on the right side, at the T junction. If I move in a certain way, or try to reach down to pick something up it hurts. I don't know if it is pulling on the incision or what. There is currently a small hole there, which is less noticeable on the left side. The PS says that this is normal. I am still sleeping on the reclining couch or in a recliner. I forgot to ask the PS when it would be okay for me to try to sleep in my regular bed. Last night I tried to sleep on the couch lying flat, but ended up twisting partially onto my side, and wound up with a sore back because of my sleeping position. I have been doing a little bit of driving. Today I drove to my post op appt, which is about 17 miles one way. I am also working on increasing my step count by a bit more each day. Yesterday I got on our treadmill twice, but only for 10 minutes each time. I had not be using it at all before my surgery. lol I am currently still wearing my normal size bra 38D, so it is hard to say what size I will be once the swelling has subsided. I have noticed the same thing about the amount of swelling being more by the end of the day.",

Some days I think I've made the right decision to do the oncoplastic, and other days I feel unsure of my decision. I can't find very many posts on here from people who have had oncoplastic. The second opinion dr seemed to think that the oncoplastic surgery would be beneficial. He said it would reduce the risk of reoccurrance, because there would be less tissue. He also said there would be less of a chance of developing seromas, which could cause deformities during radiation. The surgery also allows for symmetry in both breasts which only requires one surgery. This second opinion Dr did not do this procedure, but he felt that I had a good surgical team who could. Are there posts on here regarding oncoplastic that I am missing? I found one that was helpful, but it is fairly old and not very active. Mrsmcg",

In some ways it was easier than I thought, and it other ways it was harder. I thought that I was going to have a hard time with keeping my arms over my head, but after the the 15 to 20 minute simulation I felt okay, after I l had my arms lowered for a minute. The tattoo in the center of my chest was painful. I heard that it feels like a bug bite, but it felt more like a bee sting. The other two tattoos, one on each side weren't bad. The worst part was trying to hold my breath for 45 seconds. I was barely able to do it once. I asked the radiologist how many times the breath holds need to be done, and she said a minimum of 3 times!! What do they do if a person is unable to do it? I'm sure there are older people who wouldn't be capable of holding their breath for 45 seconds. I got great news from the radiologist! She said she checked the RO prescription, and I will need just 4 weeks of radiation instead of 6!! :) Thinking of you all and wishing everyone the best on their road of recovery!! ",

Both my mom and my sister have had breast cancer. I started taking Tamoxifen. I was recently diagnosed with INVASIVE DUCTAL CARCINOMA with tubular features and the following additional features: Nottingham histologic grade: Grade 1 (total score 3/9). Tubule formation: 1. Nuclear grade: 1. Mitotic rate: 1 I was told that there are 2 small areas (4mm and 3 mm) near 10 o'clock on the left breast. I have only had one dr's opinion (not sure if I should get a second opinion). She wants to do a lumpectomy, followed by radiation. She asked if I was interested in oncoplasty, as my right breast is larger than the left. This would require surgery on both breasts, which I'm not sure if I want to go through. Why do surgery on a breast that has nothing wrong with it?! Why should I more than double my recovery time - 2 weeks for the lumpectomy vs 4-5 weeks if I have plastic surgery?! I have a limited amount of sick leave available. My dr said that the right side would need to be reduced in size to better match my left breast. She also told me that radiation can reduce the size of the effected breast. I am not sure how much of an effect radiation has on reducing breast size. This worries me, as I don't want to end up being 2 completely different cup sizes. I am scheduled to see a plastic surgeon next week and am wondering what questions I should ask.

I am very reluctant to have the oncoplasty done on the right side at the same time as the lumpectomy is done on the left breast. I may be happy enough with how things look on the left side after radiation. The dr. said that I could wait to determine if I want to do something to the right breast, until I found out how I want to proceed with the left breast. Does anyone here have further information about sermonas and how they were affected by radiation? I can't seem to find much information on this topic. Thanks! Colleen",

He took time to answer all my questions, and loved that I brought a printed list with me. :) He explained why I would benefit from oncoplasty, and what the drawbacks were from not having the surgery. He agreed that waiting to do the right side was the best option. I also had my second opinion yesterday. The cancer surgeon was a way better communicator than my current doctor. He seemed very compassionate an caring. I left his office feeling much better informed. He said on numerous occasions that I had a great team, and that the PS was the best in the area. The problem is, that the one dr. works for Multicare, and the other dr works for Franciscan. The second opinion dr explained that Multicare did not have a surgeon of the PS caliber, and none that could perform oncoplasty. :( I am very disappointed, as I would love to have this cancer dr as my surgeon. The first dr is a great surgeon. She performed my first lumpectomy. She is just a horrible communicator. For example, when she mentioned about doing oncoplasty she just talked to about it being a benefit to having cancer - your can get a boob job!! I said I didn't want to do that, just stick with the lumpectomy, and she said okay. That's it. She did say that I could go home and look in the mirror that night and let her know if I changed my mind. What if I wouldn't have changed my mind?! I wouldn't have known that it beneficial to my care to have the procedure done, due to the fact that the cancer is very close to the skin, and the chance of having seromas. I was informed that without the oncoplasty that my breast could end up deformed. The second opinion dr agreed that the oncoplasty was a good decision. My regular dr told me none of this. She made it out like it was surgery for cosmetic purposes. Another example of the first dr's poor communication is when she talked to me about radiation. She simply said that there was whole breast radiation that would be 5 days a week, for 6-7 weeks. She said that my area was small, so I might be able to get by with 4 to 5 weeks. She also said that there was PBI - 2 times a day for 5 days. I said I would be interested in PBI due to not having a lot sick leave. She said okay, if we get clear margins PBI would be possible. When I mentioned PBI to the 2nd opinion dr. he said that he hasn't had anyone do that in a year. He explained the side effects, because of the port that is inserted to administer the radiation it has caused patients to have chronic pain years later, and it can cause hard tissue that makes it difficult to do self exams. Wow! The first dr. didn't tell me about this!! This gave me a lot more to think about before making a final decision. I don't know what drs normally suggest, but I was told to get a sports bra with a zipper to wear post surgery and that I would have to wear it for 3-7 days. I have been having a lot of difficulty finding one that fits and doesn't cause irritation (sensitive skin). I went to at least six store, and even bought 2 on-line. I asked my first dr for a prescription to go to a place that sells specialty bras. She didn't want to write the prescription because she said that it would be hard to fit a bra until after my surgery. Wouldn't it be a bit late to get one then? My breast would be swollen, and sore, and I wouldn't be able to drive to the store for a fitting. I did do the blood work for the genetic testing. I asked the nurse at the 1st dr office if it would be best for me to wait until I got the results back before scheduling the surgery. She said that I could get on the surgery schedule for a time after the testing comes back. I asked if I should wait until the results came back to have surgery, and she said that it didn't matter... but if the genetic testing came back and showed the Brip gene that the surgery could be a mastectomy!! How could she tell me that waiting for the genetic testing results to come back in didn't matter?! The dr said that the testing is more for ovarian cancer. Really wishing that I could go to the second opinion dr or that there was a way to make the 1st dr better at communicating!! Sorry for the long rambling post. Mrsmcg  ",

I had a lumpectomy last year to remove this area and have it tested to confirm if there was cancer. None was found. My mom had breast cancer at 62 and my sister had breast cancer (DCIS) at 53. She ended up having a mastectomy. I am 52, and will be 53 next month. My sister had genetic testing, which is why my breast surgeon doesn't think it is necessary for me to have BRAC testing. The biopsy results stated: ER: POSITIVE (100%, strong intensity). PR: POSITIVE (75%, strong intensity). HER2 (by immunohistochemistry): NEGATIVE (ASCO/CAP score 1+) I am perimenopausal. Today I found out that there is a second mildly suspicious area 6mm posterior to the 4mm area with IDC. For some reason this second area was no biopsied. I asked my cancer dr. about this and she stated that she isn't a radiologist, but that Ishe thinks they felt if the first area was benign then the other area would be benign as well!! What sort of logic is that?! What if the area they biopsied didn't show cancer?! They wouldn't be doing a lumpectomy, and the second area could be cancerous!! My job is pretty physical, especially upper body. My breast cancer dr told me to take at least a week off, but based on my job duties that I might be better to take 2 weeks off. I have 2 1/2 weeks of leave left. I know that I will need to take time off to have radiation. Problem is, my boss refuses to let me make up my hours on another day. I asked my GP to refer me for a second opinion, and he said that the dr I am going to is the best is the area, unless I am willing to go to Seattle, which would be very difficult for me to do.",

It is 4mm in size, with another 3mm area 6mm posterior. I have been thinking about having the left side done and leaving the right side alone. The PS agreed that this was a good idea due to the fact that I need radiation, and the left side is already smaller than the right side, which means that the PS can't just leave my left side larger. After having a day to think about it, I am wondering if I should have the right side done at the same time, as I will likely never have the time to take off work to get the right side done in the future. I will be using up all of my leave to have the BC surgery. I had a second opinion with a BC surgeon, and when I left the appointment I felt much more informed. My 1st dr. performed a lumpectomy last year (left side) and discovered ADH. She is a terrible communicator, but a great surgeon. I would love to use the 2nd opinion dr, but he does work with a PS who can perform oncoplasty. He feels that the PS I went to is the best in the area. He feels that I have a great team. It is just the I don't feel like this breast cancer surgeon gives me all thlae information that I need to make an informed decision. I am definitely going to go back and read through the rest of the posts in this threads, as I think the information you shared will help me to prepare for my surgery. I do have huge concerns about how sore my arms and chest will be after surgery. I have a job that regards a lot of repetitive upper body movement, lifting books, pushing loaded book carts, moving books from one cart to another. My PS said that I would be limited to lifting 10lbs for 6 weeks. Thanks again for your helpful posts! :) Mrsmcg",

Blooming - do you have a list of items that you found useful to have on hand post surgery, or anything that I can do to prior to surgery to help make recovery go smoother? I have been looking getting a seat belt cover. Do you have one that you would recommend? My cancer dr told me that I didn't need a post surgery bra. I had to talk her into writing me a prescription for one. I am supposed to have a fitting tomorrow. My PS said that there is a 50-50 chance that I will a drain(s). I have read that a lot of folks end up having a surgical bra put on post surgery. I am now questioning whether or not to use the prescription, or to wait until after my breasts have healed. Still waiting for my surgery date. I thought my dr. was going to put me on her schedule, but they are waiting for the genetic testing to come back. My dr's nurse told me that she would get me on the schedule, but make sure that it was set up for a time when we would have the bloodwork results back, but I have not received any other details. I saw on my MyCharts list that my dr has put in a request for NM lymphatics and lymph gland imaging. Not sure what that's for, if it is the pre-op of putting in the wire locator or the imaging for the sentinel node.",
