Any other medical problem I ever had, I went to the Dr and usually had results or answers with in days. Not when it comes to the breast! I think that it is a roller coaster that changes you forever no matter what the outcome. Good luck to you and I will hope for good results!! By the way did they give you a Birad number? ",

And lumps in the breast are 80% benign. Not like that will make you feel any better. Because it did not ever help me when I had to wait. So how about a little advice. Take your husband or someone with you to your ultra sound. Do not feel embarrassed to ask as many questions as you want. I always hated leaving a app. thinking, darn I wish I would of asked this or that. Or darn I was so nervous I cant remember what they said!  You can push for a diagnostic mammogram if you are having alot of anxiety about the lumps, but the ultrasound is great for your age. Good Luck! Let us know how it turns out.",

Than had a MRI that showed a mass in a separate area from hyperplasia and micro calcifications. I was really surprised when they told me they would be doing more than one excision because I didn't know they had found anything else on the MRI. I was in shock and didn't ask any questions.  I think I will just suck it up until Thursday so I can go over it with the Dr. Glad to have people to talk to that have been in this situation before. I don't think anyone else would get it.",

Just wanted to give some tips that I thought would of been useful to know before my mastectomy. Get two small rectangle pillows. They work perfect for sleeping up in bed. I had one for under each arm. You need to support your arms, its to painful to let them just fall into place. Also make sure you have a small pillow for under your seatbelt in the car. A lady form the Cancer society brought me one. A back scratcher! My back was always itching! Stay on top of your pain pills the first couple of days. Maybe line up someone to come over and wash and fix your hair when you get home. I could not lift my arms to brush or wash my hair for at least a week. Last thing I can think of is silk shorts or pants. Makes it so much easier to adjust yourself in bed or the couch. Good luck ladies, it will be over soon and just a bad memory!!!",

Aromasin is for post men. 2 years ago I had a complete hysterectomy for complex cysts and lesions on my cervix and all over my ovaries. At that time I told my gyn. that I had lumps in my breast and she told me at my age she would not worry about them and they would most likely go away after my hyst. A year later my sister-in law went in for her 40 year mam. and called with the news she had breast cancer. I went in 3 days later. By the way I found the Aromasin much more tolerable than the Tamoxofin. What I am wondering now is if I can start taking a estrogen for my hot flash's and all of the other fun symptoms that come along with menopause. Twolumps that is great that they are coming to help with cleaning. :)",

Fast forward 3 lumpectomies a year of Dr visits and a mastectomy and I read my very first surgeon visit report and he said patient has many palpable lumps in both breast, clusters of calcifications on mam,ultrasound shows complex cysts and area of concern in both breasts, stereo biopsy shows atypical cells. He goes on to say that due to her her age (35) my recommendation to her will be a double mastectomy with or without reconstruction. MRI will be ordered first.
