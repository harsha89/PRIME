I've been through alot in the past 6 months...my mom diagnosed with stage 4 lung & bone cancer, I had shoulder surgery, a hysterectomy & now all of this!  Having to go back for the 2nd biopsy threw me for a loop!  Wasn't expecting to have to do that.  And having an MRI guided biopsy was very uncomfortable & a long process.  Plus dealing with all the insurance through all of this isn't fun either!  But I'm staying positive.  I had 2 close friends diagnosed with BC in 2012 & i'm very proactive in my health.  I'm a long time BC supporter, I even walked the 30.3 miles for the Avon BC Walk this past October & I'm already signed up to do it again this fall!!! I just don't like the unknown & can't wait til all procedures are done & results are in! Thank you & best health to you also!",

I've been going back & forth for 8 weeks already!  I just want this taken care of!  Thank you for sharing your journey with me.  I'm not much for taking vicodin either.  I had my hysterectomy & only took 2 pills.  I was fine with the advil.  Great news that your \"girls\" are free and clear of \"that word\" & you can be over that hurdle.  I am going to take one step at at time but sometimes that's easier said than done.  Best wishes to you!! And thanks for the encouragement!",

It's a tiny bit tender but nothing horrible.  I almost wish I felt just a little bit worse because I know I'll be tempted to do more than I'm supposed to be.  Sitting still & relaxing is not one of my strong points!  The waiting the 3-5 days for the results will be the hardest part but I'll be very busy with work & family so hoping it will make the time pass. Thank you everyone for your encouraging words.  I'm so glad I found this forum to gather more information & get educated! I'll be back to  share my results!",

How were the side effects?  Did anyone decide against it?  My mind is racing more about that decision than anything else right now.  I am scared to death that I will have a positive diagnosis & have no choice but that decision will be obvious if that were the case.
