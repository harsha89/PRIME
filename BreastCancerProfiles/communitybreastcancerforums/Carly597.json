Will my follow ups be with her? I have seen 3 different people before the op but as she performed It will I see her again? She was so lovely I don't think I want to see anyone else, and also all the info I have seen online says phyloides tumors only really happen in women over 40 I'm only 31 is this not normal? Sorry for all the questions I'm just going out of my head with worry ad I don't even know if it's benign yet xxx Log in to post a reply",
