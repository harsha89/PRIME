You need to make decisions and plans, but don't have enough information. As the information funnels in, you can make your decisions then. It a marathon, not a sprint. I was diagnosed in May 2015. I am single and the only breadwinner and like you, need to keep working to maintain insurance. BTW...I also have CareFirst. They have been very good so far. I got tagged for an \"out-of-network\" lab charge. I'm appealing that right now to try and get the cost discounted. But otherwise, they've been very good. If you live where you will be treated, you may not have to take much time from work. I only took 2 days for the lumpectomy. But I got an extra day due to a holiday weekend. Other than a few doctor appts, that is all the time I've had to take off. I have a sedentary job. I look at computer screens all day in an operations center. My manager is allowing me to flex my work hours. I can shift my hours around a little bit, i.e., next week I will be leaving work one hour early for my radiation treatments. They're pretty cool about it as long as the time-sensitive work gets done. I start radiation on Monday and plan on working through it. I did not have to do chemo. So I'm very thankful for that. Before I was actually diagnosed and all the testing was being done, I was in total denial. I knew all the results would come back negative. Then when I got the diagnosis, I too fell apart. I have very supportive friends that were there for me. Once I accepted the fact that I had cancer, I chose to be out there with it. Some people keep it very low key and private. I was/am the opposite. I have bumper stickers on my car, I told all my facebook friends and told my coworkers. I've become an advocate. No questions off the table. Everything. But everyone handles it differently. In their own way. Once I decided to \"own it\" and tell my extended family of friends, I wrote a \"Rules of Navigation\" for my friends. I even gave it to my boss and coworkers. I have one co-worker (cancer survivor) that read it and said I had \"nailed it\". It helps friends, family and co-workers navigate through this ordeal with you. I'll post it if you wish, but I don't want to press you. You have to go at your own pace. But my Rules did me feel better and it helped my friends understand how to deal with me. It sucks right now. And it's OK to get mad and angry. You deserve it. But, I promise, it WILL get better.",

But my underarm nodes are in my radiation field. In the beginning I asked my techs to draw an outline of my rad field with a Sharpie. I was surprised how much area wbr covers. So even with just a lumpectomy, if you have wbr, it is a large area. Ask your techs for an outline. I have some areas that were inside the markings, but do not have any skin reaction at all. So I'm thinking, not too bad. It could've been a lot worse. My rad field starts at my sternum below my neck, goes across my chest to around my armpit then down my side (under the arm) to below my bra line and then back to my sternum about an inch below my bra line and then back up the sternum to below my neck. It's like a big square. That's whole breast radiation. I might also note I had/have IDC and ILC. We're all the same, but different.",

It's the unknown and hearing all the frightening stories that your \"friend\" put in your head. Things like what happened to so-n-so, from somewhere else, that had rads, got pregnant and delivered a litter of kittens. WTF? You know who the \"friend\" I'm talking about. After the first week, mentally it gets easier. It becomes routine and you spend more time talking about what you did over the weekend than your procedure. If it helps I made a video of one of my sessions. The way I was positioned I couldn't see anything. My head was turned and my face was buried in my armpit (on the good side) for the entire procedure. I edited to cut out the longer wait periods. The original video/session was 12 minutes. Once I saw my video, it helped me understand what was going on and the sounds the machine was making.

I suggest you start using the cooling towel right away. I'm a self-proclaimed GEEK. I had an infrared, no-touch, surface thermometer. I started measuring the surface temp of my boobs. In the first week, my radiated boob was 1-2 degrees warmer than the other. Week 2 it was 2-3 degrees more. Week 3-6 it peaked out at 6-7 degrees and stayed around there. In other words, the heat build-up starts on day one. What is happening on your skin surface is also happening deep in your breast tissue. Your breast/tissue is like a giant heat sink. The more you can draw down that heat, the better. Don't wait until you're visibly burned on the outside. That's only the tip of the iceberg. On Soap\u2026My rad tech and RO said don't use any soap. They said just let water run over your breast. Do not wash it or rub it. Pat it dry with a towel. I can't emphasize enough about the rubbing. I \"rubbed\" an area that was beginning to peel and some of the dried skin came off pre-maturely. The skin underneath wasn't quite ready for prime time. So it was sensitive in that area for a few days while the new skin \"toughened up\". QMC\u2026Interesting about the Aquaphor allergy. I wonder how many women have suffered thinking it was the rads and not an allergic reaction. Good info.",

But you could wear a Cami over it and tuck into your pants. And yes, there are some shirts that don't fit this strategy and you may not be able to wear for the next few weeks. That's ok. Think about layers. Fortunately the weather is turning cooler so that is in your favor. Layers can hide things. If your bra is rubbing in a particular place try stuffing something soft in that area.

I ask more questions about how the machine works than I do my radiation. Sometimes it seems useless to even ask. The answers never really answer my question. As a planner, you will do well. I'm sure you've read and researched to the \"n\"th degree. So you have an idea of what may, or may not, happen. Mentally, you are prepared. As things arise, you will take the proper steps to work with it. If you can prevent something, or at least lessen its impact, you will do so. For example, your armpits are getting a little tender. My advice...don't run any 5k's or marathons. Don't use the elliptical with the arm handles. Don't wear tops that are scratchy and stiff. Do what works and makes sense to you. I've also learned to trust my techs. With 45 years combined experience, they know what works and doesn't. During one of my darker days, one of my techs (Helga the Hun) revealed that she is a breast cancer survivor too. She's been exactly where I am now. So even though I get frustrated with their answers sometimes, I trust them. My armpits are a bit sensitive right now too, so yesterday I told my Physical Therapist that I'm not going to do the hand-bike anymore. I'm not gonna do anymore exercises that will cause my arm to rub against my side. I'm not going to wait until my armpits are like hamburger to stop doing things that are counter-intuitive to keeping them as healthy as possible. I know I won't get through this without any pain, but my plan is to protect my skin enough to get through this with minimum discomfort. It's not forever, It just seems like it sometimes. ",

She stopped at the grocery store on the way home. Everyone was staring at her. She looked down and realized her shirt was wet in the breast area. She knew people were wondering why a 62 year old would be lactating. lol It is still a good plan, but you might have to change your blouse when you get to work. You don't really have to have it dripping wet. You can put it over your bra or go commando with a light t shirt while you drive to work. Then get dressed up appropriately at work. You can apply your lotions or gels when changing at work. Be careful not to spill cornstarch on your nice clothes, if you use cornstarch. Don't forget to leave your jacket on when you're scuttling to the changing room. We don't need anymore lactating grandmas out there. (Sorry to offend if you're not grandma age.)

So my job is not very physical. Yeh. There maybe a dish or two in the sink or a stack of unopened mail on the table, but I'm still working. And that has been my priority. I was a gym rat for the two years before BC. Not so much now. But again, I've been distracted by work and all this. I sometimes feel a bit envious and maybe a tad intimidated by the miles, steps and workouts some of you ladies do. Yes. I know that exercise helps through this process, but what helps me even more is getting a paycheck, maintaining my insurance coverage and paying my bills (eventually... remember the unopened stack of mail?). Anyway, I'll be ringing the bell on Friday. And hopefully be back at the gym in a week or two. Everything's intact. No weeping or oozing. That CVS Aftersun aloe with lidocaine is all I've used. The lidocaine really, really helps with the tingling, sensitive skin. If this is the worst it gets, then I'll call it a success.

Leave it there for five minutes or so. When you remove it, you can feel the hot spot in the towel where it was tucked under. It doesn't have to be on your skin. It can be over a lightweight shirt or garment. It's easy to refresh the towel. You don't have to re-wet it. Just whip it around it the air or pop it like a whip a few times. It cools right back down.

Do whatever makes sense to you to relieve any areas of discomfort. I too have a computer job. There is no privacy (I work in a control center). Fortunately the ac is set very low and I wear a light sweater/jacket all the time. During the really uncomfortable times, I slipped into the restroom and removed my bra. I worked braless all day. No one was the wiser. It is important, at this time, to take immediate action to stop any rubbing or whatever is creating your discomfort. Change your bra style/size, stuff silk scarves in your sensitive areas, roll a soft cloth under your boob to prevent skin to skin contact, use the cooling towel to draw out that radiation heat. Whatever it takes. Nurse your way thru this next week. It'll pay dividends later.",

Heat is damage. Ice is too harsh. The cooling towel is more gentle. If you turn red, use whatever you would normally use for a sunburn plus lidocaine for the pain. My worst week was the end of week 4 and early week five. That's when the area under my boob was challenging. I stopped wearing a bra during that week and used just my towel and the aloe/lidocaine. I always kept something under my breast to prevent skin to skin contact. Sometimes a bath cloth, sometimes a scarf. Week six was easier. Just listen to your body. If it's dry, moisturize it. If it stings, use the aloe/lidocaine. If clothing is rubbing you the wrong way, change it. If it's hot, cool it. If it's raw, protect it. Don't glob it with stuff if it doesn't need it, Especially if it's going to trap all the heat inside. Radiation. It's not like a sunburn, it's like a microwave. It's cooking from the inside out.",

Anytime during the day if I felt tingling or pain I would immediately apply my aloe w/lidocaine on the painful area. The lidocaine stops any mild pain. I kept some in my drawer at work and sometimes used it 2 or 3 times a day. My worst time was week 4 and 5. That was when the area under my breast starting breaking.

Mostly cause everything was new and hyper fear of the unknown. I was also on information overload and had people telling me these horrible stories. I imagined that all of them would happen to me. So far, that has not been the case. It got better when I realized all the nightmares didn't come true. You're a unique person. Your experience will be different from everyone else. It will be a combination of bits and pieces of the rest of our stories. It's an emotional roller coaster. Take this first week to get use to the process and figure out the techs. I have this really harsh tech that I secretly call \"Helga the Hun\". The other tech is sweet and compassionate. I've found that together they make the right combination for me. Sometimes I need a little Helga and sometimes I need the sweet one. Helga is really ok. I've learned that she's really a marshmallow under that harsh exterior. Can't sleep? I can sleep, but wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. I know if I put away all the electronics I will fail back to sleep. But here I am, on my phone. I guess I'm better at giving advice than following it.  Good luck on the rest of your first week. Remember to breathe, keep calm and squelch all those \"what ifs\". And if you can't, we're here.",

I don't know about the lidocaine cream you mentioned above. You have to check anything you use with your rad techs or RO. I subscribe to the philosophy that \"more is not always better\". If 1% works for you, why take the jump up to the max right away? There's comfort in knowing that you can move to something more intense if you need to. If you start with the maximum overkill and it doesn't work, where do you go from there? I'm confused about the 5%. My RO wrote me a prescription for 2%. It was not an over-the-counter product. I never used it. I just kept it as a standby, in case. It was my security blanket if I needed it. The instructions for the 2% say to wear gloves because it can make your fingers go numb while applying it. 5% sounds crazy. But it's nice to know it's there.....if you need it. BTW...If you do ever use it, let everyone know how it works. And remember....keep the receipt. lol",

I found two effective methods for chilling the cooling towel. #1) Grasp one end of the towel and then crack it like a whip. Do this several times. Then do the same thing while holding the other end. This will cool the towel down to 64 degrees. Method #2) Grasp one end of the towel and twirl it round and round and round above your head or out to your side. I wet the towel down with warm water (just for the experiment). Both methods cooled the towel down to 64 degrees. So you don't have to refrigerate the towel or use ice cold water. Just get it wet. You can put the towel over a light weight t-shirt or directly on your skin. I draped the towel over the whole radiation area, but I always made sure I tucked it under my boob. That is a super heat area. After five minutes I rearranged the towel to keep a cool area under the boob. You'll feel the hot spot on the towel. That means it is working. When you don't have any more cool spots on the towel then just refresh it by whipping it or twirling it in the air. You don't have to keep rinsing it with water. The area under the arm gets warm too. So don't forget it. Use the towel before you apply lotion or gel. The lotion or gel impedes the heat transfer process. When you are done with your cooling process, apply your lotions or gels.",

That was due to a skin reaction to adhesive during my lx. There's some shadowing from the light on my arm. I am still expecting the dark area to peel and am currently treating it with Cetaphil to keep it going as long as possible so the new skin underneath can form. For reference, this is my left armpit but is reversed in a mirror. So it looks like a right armpit. Same thing on the boobs in the previous post. ",

They want to use the max possible to kill the cancer but let the human survive. Since we're all human, I would think that number would be the same. When I was finished, I literally rang the bell and they had a certificate. I kinda thought the certificate was cheesy. It's not like I'm going to frame it and put it on the wall or anything. I finished 2 weeks ago and am fully healed. I'm still peeling, but the skin underneath is healthy and tan. Unfortunately I'm going back this afternoon to the same facility and meet with my MO to start AIs. :o(",

      "Content": "Oct 14, 2015 01:31PM - edited Oct 14, 2015 03:22PM by Keys-Plez Molly....I wore a sports bra that was 2 sizes too big. I got the Fruit of the Loom, 3 in a pack, tank-style for $11 at Walmart. They're also on Amazon. They don't really support much, but they keep the girls from flopping. And the bra is so big that I could pull it down below my normal bra line so it didn't irritate that \"skin fold\" area. Also if I needed more support, I put a rolled up bathcloth under each breast. That also prevented skin to skin contact which is a heat-retaining, bacteria area. You can't tell the difference in the sizes of your boobs, cause you wind up with a singular uni-boob. You have to be creative as to what type of top to wear cause your headlights (if you have any) will be evident. Layers work good for that. I also loved my \"cooling towel\". I used it everyday. Amazon link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DL33TXS?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00 They are $19 for 3 on Amazon.",

KBeee\u2026You are so right about the alcohol.Check out the difference in the CVS vs Walgreens Aloe w/lidocaine.These two products look exactly the same, but the Walgreens brand has water and alcohol as its #1 and #2 ingredients. I advocate the CVS brand because that was what my rad techs advised. And, it worked for me. They said it did not interfere with the radiation beam. Make sure you get the blue not green. The blue has lidocaine. The green does not. ",
