Please hang on while I take you on a short ride. My sis-in-law was dx in 1999 and sorry I don't know all the particulars but she had rt.breast mastectomy and left breast reduction and reconstructive surgery one year later. 7 yrs we WERE celebrating and now the disappointment has hit hard. She actually has a two year history of \"unexplained rib fractures\". Nothing but bone density tests and some x-rays. When she became sore in her chest this time she persisted until her onc finally did a bone scan and PET scan. I was at the appointment when he delivered the news about her reoccurrence. After giving us as little info as possible he politely folded the written radiology report in half and handed it to my sis and said \" I don't usually do this, but take this copy and don't read it\". Well what do you think I did. READ IT!!!! My sis didn't. It said widespread metastatic disease, rt 9th rib, sternum, rt humurus, liver, and rt pleural effusion and something about hypermetabolism. There was more but that was the jest of it. So I think it pretty clear that she has metastic disease. Right? Four appointments later and he still has not mentioned it to her. So the other sisters and I don't know if we should tell sis. I think he is waiting for her to ask. Who has time for games? Not sis. I just feel like this is some silly idea to get her to ask rather than laying all the cards on the table and letting her make good decisions. She is crazy about him and he always greets her with a hug, lots of compliments and we all feel like he just doesn't have the nerve to tell her everything. Liver biopsy showed HER2 positive tumor.Unannounced to the family, while they had her in the lab doing the liver biopsy they also drained her lung. (Cancer cells were found in the fluid.)We were in the waiting room thinking she would be gone and hour or so with a 3 hour recovery time in a room. Three hours later a nurse told us what they had done. Sis signed the consent after they took her back for the biopsy. He knew going in that the PET scan showed pleural effusion. He said at the next appointment that the pathologist called his office during the biopsy to see if he wanted him to remove the fluid while he was in. Onc is planning the following: Arimidex, Zometa, Herceptin, Taxol. It took me 3 days of reading every thread on this forum to decide to post. Please anyone who has an idea about what to do next reply. Sis will not hear of a second opinion at this point. She doesn't know how bad things are. She only has a small fraction of the story. Correct me if I am wrong, but from what I have read you girls like to know the truth. Sewfinegirl \"I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse!

Ok, I recently changed oncs.  Now going to major comprehensive cancer center.  Seeing onc monthly and will see her next week.  In December, I will have been living with mets for six years.  Bone mets only.  Several local recurrences until I had the girls cut off. For all these years with a couple of different oncs (moved to different state), I've been getting either PET scans or most recently CT scans.  I've also gotten bone scans.  When my bone mets were stable, we'd go 6-9 months between CT scans.  Now the new onc....she does not want to do CT or PET scans. Her reasoning?  \"You've only had disease in your bones.\"  I can understand that.  But for my peace of mind, I think I need CT or PET every six to nine months. At the end of June during my first visit, my new onc ordered bone scan and 'skeletal survey' (full body xrays).  Several new bone mets showed on these tests, plus progression on existing rib mets.  I had been off ALL my treatments for about a month in the process of changing oncs.  SO....I am thinking with so many new bony mets...I want to make sure during my tx break I don't have organ involvement now. Am I being unreasonable by wanting to go in her office next week and demand a scan to check my organs?  Thanks for your thoughts.  I don't usually start posts about myself because I feel like so many women here are dealing with far more difficult situations.  This is so petty compared to the horrors so many others are dealing with.

Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor. Those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent. His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together....  Author unknown...",

I've had periods of no tumors or NED as we affectionately refer to it....No Evidence of Disease, and I've been on herceptin continuously.  You need to continue on herceptin to help you stay that way.  I advise you to seriously question your onc's thinking on this.  Do you have heart issues?  Herceptin can be hard on the heart.  While on herceptin you should regularly receive echos or mugas.  Personally?  I would not accept your onc's plan of stopping herceptin.  As her2+, we are blessed to have herceptin as a MOST important tool to keep our advanced stage disease in check. ",

Crappola on her and her attitude.  Tracy, you know you've got a lot of us in your corner, surrounding you with love and strength!  Lean on us and you will be back in the ring, beating the crap out of bc.

We are here for you anytime! Bethie P.S.  One thing many are not made aware of:  Be careful with dental procedures if you are on Zometa.  Be sure to tell your dentist you are on this drug!  There is a rare side effect from prolonged use of zometa....osteonecrosis of the jaw bone.",

I was having horrible rib pain and was dx'd with a rib met.  It was the only active met at the time (had previous resolved bone mets). I did rads to the rib....I think 15 treatments. I got some relief. And it didn't grow again for about 9 months, and then progression. So we did 10 additional treatments from a different angle. Once again it retarded the growth...for awhile. However, my rib began breaking at the slightest weird movement. I guess it has broken at least 5-6 times over the past year. This past December it showed major progression. So we added tykerb to my herceptin and faslodex. In February, all of the sudden the pain increased and It did not feel like the pain from previous breaks. Scans are showing stable...but man the pain is so much worse. I switched from oxycodone to dilaudid. It has helped with the pain. One thing I wanted you to know....with the first progression and meeting with the rad onc about doing additional rads, she says the ribs can be tricky to radiate.  Like thanks for telling me this the first time around..lol. Also, both med and rad oncs believe between the cancer in the rib and the radiation, the rib has weaken tremendously...therefore the frequent fractures. Just wanted you to know my experience. I wish the best of luck to you! Free feel to PM if you want. Let us know how you are doing. Hugs, Bethie",

I have also known several people who've had bone marrow biopsies.  Perhaps some will come by and share their experiences. I would definitely ask your onc about a bone marrow biopsy and what that means on your report. Let us know. Hugs, Bethie",

Here is the perhaps controversial part of my bone mets history.  I really didn't have any pain with my mets.  My onc and rad onc really thought we should radiate all my tumors.  At first it was only three places, huge tumor on my skull, outer lining of spinal cord, and tumor on L2.  I had 15 rad tx to all these areas.  The tumor on my skull no longer shows on any scans.  Also, the L2 tumor shows no active cancer.  Last year I had pain in ribs, and found a rib met.  I also had rads to it.  My onc carefully considered if I should go to chemo.  But together, we decided to just wait, only one rib met......hold off on the chemo big guns till I really need it.  I am very happy with the tx and decisions I've made regarding my mets.  My quality of life is good.  I am definitely not like the old me before breast cancer.  I get very tired very quickly. But hey, I feel pretty good most days.  I never thought I'd be here FIVE years after my mets dx.  But here I am and I still have lots of chemo options when I need them.  My current onc calls me an anomaly.  Maybe it is time to find an onc that considers bone mets a chronic disease and not a death sentence.  Print our posts and show him it is not all doom and gloom.  Oncs need to stop being so pessimistic.  I know LuAnn has collected a group of 'hope' stories.  Those of us LIVING with mets.  She is happy to email those to you if you wish.  (Lu, don't you love how I just volunteered you!!!)  Post and let us know how things are going.  Sorry you've had to join us, but you will find lots of hope, support and others who understand EXACTLY what you feel.

My current onc doesn't do PET scans.  When I've been stable, we do bone scans and chest, ab and pelvic CTs every six months.  Because of my her2+ status, we do a annual brain MRI.  I am comfortable with that.  Of course, if I have any symptoms, we scan immediately.  Best of luck and hugs.

Why is it that once you 'know' what's going on, i.e. having new symptoms and finding out what it is, suddenly you 'feel' even more 'things'.  Now that I know the thumping/popping sensation is bone all messed up in there, it is just about to make me sick to my stomach.  I guess the mind is a powerful thing.  So I am trying use my brain to my advantage....mind over matter kinda thing. I will let everyone know the outcome of the onc's visit.  Thank you again for all the love, advice and research!  And especially those gentle hugs....I feel them!

Major progression of my rib.  My onc described my rib as a 'mess'.  So my long run on herceptin is over.  I've had the limit of radiation to this rib.  Obviously rads may have slowed it down, but sure as heck didn't stop it.  Over past few weeks I've experienced more pain and a new issue.  As I inhale and exhale, there is a popping, thumping feeling all in the area.  The ct tech put her hand over the area and immediately felt it.  It is disconcerting to say the least.  Onc said the rib is such a mess, the thumping/popping feeling are fragments of bones rubbing and rattling around.  Lovely visual, huh?  So I will see onc on Monday.  She is thinking of adding tykerb.  Said there are a couple of studies showing tykerb with herceptin is getting some good results.  We will discuss if we will just add tykerb for now and rescan in a few months or go ahead and start a chemo also.  I am also on faslodex, so I will discuss changing AI's too.  I've only done femara and now faslodex for past 2 1/2 years. With so many of you having such difficult times, I hesitated to even share this news.  I still feel so fortunate that my mets have been so slow to progress.  Many others here are having far worse issues.  My 'messy' rib is minor compared to the horrible ordeals many of my sisters here deal with everyday.  But as couple of you told me today on the phone, any progression just sucks.  Yes, it does.  Damn this frigin disease. Couple of questions:  anyone doing tykerb AND herceptin?  Also, I vaguely remember someone here taking tamoxifen after hysterectomy?  Perhaps aromasin would be a better option.  Any thoughts? Y'all know how much I love y'all.  Could use a few 'very gentle' hugs.  I am really going to take it easy...concerned about puncturing the lung with bones shifting about in there.  Hugs and love all around, Bethie (aus)  \"I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse!

Major progression of my rib.  My onc described my rib as a 'mess'.  So my long run on herceptin is over.  I've had the limit of radiation to this rib.  Obviously rads may have slowed it down, but sure as heck didn't stop it.  Over past few weeks I've experienced more pain and a new issue.  As I inhale and exhale, there is a popping, thumping feeling all in the area.  The ct tech put her hand over the area and immediately felt it.  It is disconcerting to say the least.  Onc said the rib is such a mess, the thumping/popping feeling are fragments of bones rubbing and rattling around.  Lovely visual, huh?  So I will see onc on Monday.  She is thinking of adding tykerb.  Said there are a couple of studies showing tykerb with herceptin is getting some good results.  We will discuss if we will just add tykerb for now and rescan in a few months or go ahead and start a chemo also.  I am also on faslodex, so I will discuss changing AI's too.  I've only done femara and now faslodex for past 2 1/2 years. With so many of you having such difficult times, I hesitated to even share this news.  I still feel so fortunate that my mets have been so slow to progress.  Many others here are having far worse issues.  My 'messy' rib is minor compared to the horrible ordeals many of my sisters here deal with everyday.  But as couple of you told me today on the phone, any progression just sucks.  Yes, it does.  Damn this frigin disease. Couple of questions:  anyone doing tykerb AND herceptin?  Also, I vaguely remember someone here taking tamoxifen after hysterectomy?  Perhaps aromasin would be a better option.  Any thoughts? Y'all know how much I love y'all.  Could use a few 'very gentle' hugs.  I am really going to take it easy...concerned about puncturing the lung with bones shifting about in there.  Hugs and love all around, Bethie (aus)  \"I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse!

Had a long visit with my onc yesterday.  Unfortunately, I discovered some more possible 'bad' news.  The bone scan picked up some stuff on my right side ribs.  The bad rib with major progression is on my left side.  However, the CT scan report did not say anything about the new things on the right side.  The bone scan and CT scan were read by different radiologists. So...my Onc is having the radiologist reread the CT scan in the right ribs area since bone scan showed possible beginning of mets on 2-3 ribs  But even if there are new mets on the right side, we are sticking with the plan with made yesterday. So here is the plan.  On Thursday I will have muga to check heart, brain MRI (it is time for the annual one since I am her2+++), and we are throwing in a bone density test for the heck of it.  If muga is ok, next week we will continue herceptin, faslodex and add tykerb.  Then we will scan again in two months.  I tried to get onc to rescan in three months, but she feels better with two months.  If we don't see the results we want in two months we've got a several of ideas for adding a chemo, xeloda, navelbine, or taxotere. We discussed lots of things: Removing the 'bad' rib?  She will only consider this for palliative reasons only.  The horse is out of the barn, as we southerners say.  And especially since there is evidence of possible new bone mets.  But it can be done.  But as most of us know, these oncs don't like us metsters undergoing surgery.  Plus my onc said with the progression of the rib, we will have something to measure the effectiveness of new treatments.  That make sense to me. Biopsying the rib to check if receptors have changed?  I learned that with bone biopsies you only have a 60% chance of getting a good specimen of cancer cells.  Since this daggum rib has been radiated twice, the chances of getting a good sample of cancer cells are very low.  But if there is new stuff on the right side, we can always biopsy that. Thank you again for all of the love and support.  I feel good about the plan and plan B, C, etc.lol Huge hugs for my posse....could not do this without y'all, Bethie (aus)",
