Thanks for your patience jdfnj. (*smile*) As for breaking the news to my fiance, you're absolutely right - I suppose this would be the best time to find out if he is indeed the kind of man I think he is...and it won't matter how I tell him. But do I really wanna know??",

I feel so much better. Lisa, I didn't think to ask the question about my birads rating, but I'll be sure to ask during my biop surgery consult. I will try to learn the new BC dot org lingo (how'm I doin'?), get up the nerve to tell my fiance this weekend, and keep you all posted.",

I read your profile - how nice to meet a fellow musician! I am also a Prekindergarten teacher. It was difficult to get through my first day back to work today (after an 8-wk recovery from myomectomy surgery) without crying. Children are so sensitive and sense things easier than one might think. One little girl asked me \"Did the doctor CUT you open??\" as she emphaticly demonstrated a slicing motion with her hand. She then proceeded to announce to each parent that came in, \"Ms. --- is back, but the doctors CUT her open!\" I am wondering how they will handle it if I have to leave again for breast surgery recovery or chemo treatments.",

      "Content": "symphonyinD wrote: I am 44 years old, but I cried like a baby the entire drive home when the radiologist told me about my mammogram results. I saw other drivers and pedestrians who were curiously peering over at me sobbing at the dashboard, but I just couldn't help it! I went for an initial mammogram 1 & 1/2 weeks ago and was asked to come in for an \"additional imaging\" via letter from \"The Women's Center\". After receiving that letter, I thought to myself, always the optimist, \"It was just probably a trace of deodorant that I didn't wash off well enough!\" I remember the technician had scolded me for wearing deodorant to the mammogram screening and her saying how traces of the deodorant could show up in the results. I feel so silly for thinking that now! My appointment was yesterday. I don't know what all the technical terms mean, but I was informed by a radiologist that I have tiny clusters of \"calcifications\" in my right breast and will need to schedule a biopsy. I was told I could have a choice of either a surgical biopsy or a needle biopsy. This is all so surreal. I'm ashamed to say my last mammogram was 3 years ago. After hearing that decision on the news about women in their forties not needing a mammogram as often as previously thought, I kinda relaxed about getting one done and probably wouldn't have gone for another year or so, especially since there is no history of breast cancer in my family and I do self exams. It was during a routine physical that my primary doctor who, disagreeing with those findings, urged me to go. And I am so glad I did. I have to go Friday, April 16th to meet with the breast surgeon to schedule a biopsy. I am so scared, and the silliest things will set off tears. I try not to think about it all. I feel doubly stressed because I have just gotten through an 8 week recovery period for a myomectomy (removal of uterine fibroids), and today was my first day back to work since Feb 5th. I am so glad to have found this forum because I am not ready to tell anyone about my mammogram results. I just got engaged this past September, and while my fiance was absolutely wonderful during my major surgery and recovery period, I am so afraid of what he will think of me. I already have a long, vertical abdominal scar from my recent surgery, and the thought of losing my right breast, or even of getting a scar from the biopsy scares me. I know I sound vain and superficial, but, nonetheless, this is how I feel. I am usually a very optimistic, positive person who always sees the glass as half full - but not this time. This all stinks! I mean, can I just get married and live happily ever after?? Log in to post a reply",
