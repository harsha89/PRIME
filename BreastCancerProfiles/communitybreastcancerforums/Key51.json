Was recently Diagnosed with MBC, no symptoms other than back pain which promoted an ER visit. In the 11.5 years between Dx's I have had other health issues. Rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, depression, diverticulitis, gallbladder removed. Radiation was physically draining for me, but I was working full time and driving 150+ miles daily. Had some throat issues until they slightly moved one of my reference points. Still in shock over this recent Dx and having difficulty adjusting to new medications. Hoping to find support and friendship here as well.",
