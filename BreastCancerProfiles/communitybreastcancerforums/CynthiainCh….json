Many people untouched by breast cancer believe mammography guaurentees early detection and cure. I want to raise \"awareness\" it isn't always true. I am captain of a team called IV Moving Forward in the American Cancer Society  Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk in Park Ridge, IL May 4, 2013. I am looking for feet on the street, not fund raising dollars. If you can join me, I will pay your registration fee. If you can't join me consider sending a passionate advocate who will speak out. More cures, less marketing.",

I had my surgery in another state and flew three times with my surgical drain in! No LE. For safty defintely wear a compression garment an hour before and an hour after the flight and you should be fine. (Never heard anyone say a compression garment that fits correctly can cause any harm.) I second the advice to have a professional fit you with your first sleeve and gaunlet. Now that I know my size, I order them over the net. Not only have I taken a dozen short domestic flights within my first year after surgery (and big time chemo, radiation etc), I have been overseas twice. No problems. Drink lots of water, move around on the plane if you can and have fun! ",

Just this morning I laid in bed for an extra hour because everything hurt. I'm on Celebrex which some think has anti-CA properties. I was diagnosed with RA as a teenager and always found over the counter anti-inflammatories better than the harder drugs. I just cycled through the choices to see what worked best for me. Sounds like you have an opportunity to do that trying the various things suggested above. I also want to mention two other things. Not all pain is from depression, there is a lot of data about AIs causing pain, so let me validate that pain might be completely indepent of your mood. Also, I don't have a husband or a partner. If it gives you the most pleasure to just sit on the couch with your husband, ask him to do that and tell him he is giving you what you want most. last, happy belated birthday. If you wake up in les pain one day, declare it your birthday and go for it! ",
