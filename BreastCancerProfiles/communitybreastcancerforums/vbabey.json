I got chemo #2 Wed, feels alot different, a little more shakey, and aware of all the meds in my body, have not taken Ativan, but yesterday after my shot felt a little naseaus from 3:00 on. I will have to try it. My hair is all over the place, cant wash it now for three days. Today is the big day!  I had the hairdresser coming tonite to shave it, but opted out and instead my husband and my two teenage girls are going to share the duty. I think they can keep it a little lighter for me.  I will be taking my first Ativan for that for sure.   Sanaisa- I was recommended for my constiption the two senna s morning and night, if that doesnt work, after one day with no bm, mix 1/3 cup raisin or prunes, 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup bran, mix together take two tsp with 8 oz water at bedtime, then if no bm for two days have Smooth Move Tea, then 3rd day add mirlax to the above. So far I have been doing well with the 4 senna-s daily, I go alot, but I am more relaxed now about that.  I read your post about the rads vs heart damage. At age 38 my brother in law was dx'd with a fatal case of mesotheliomia in 1994, went to many well known specialists, including top docs at Sloan Kettering, most said even with surgury, he only had maybe a year and a half, he chose a young aggresive doc at columbia pres in ny and he is still here with us! Breaking records.He probably got the most aggresive rads possible. Dx'd recently with blocked arteries, he recently underwent an attempt at a bypass, but they had to close him up unsuccessfully as yes, his heart has been damaged and sort of merged with his back, I am sure there is a better medical term for that, but I dont know it, sorry! . Anyway, days later they did the riskier stent op, risky because of where the stents had to be put it, corners and such, with such a out of place heart, but he came through fine a month ago. Docs are amazing today. Who knows where he would be without the radiation?",

For now just plow through and take one day at a time.  I hope you stick with your friends, they are the best people to have around you. Thanks for the Taxol tips, I feel better prepared and will see my oncologist today to see how things are for me and dicuss Gemzar added to my Taxol. Must reccommend again that book, by the way Crazy, Sexy, Cancer..loved it, loved it, made me laugh out loud throughout this mess! If you haven't read it please do...saw the movie, but the book is much better I think!!  ",

After the store, after the groceries are unloaded, after opening my wallet, etc. Hopefully they will not dry out and shrivel up! I've heard that a little neosporin dabbed on the nose may prevent an airborne from lodging there, but this is debatable. Just a reminder for all of you, stay healty, feel good!

Sometimes I just cant think of what to say.   Thanks for keeping up on all of your posting, I must tell you I love reading them and always feel better when I do.  I had to get hydrated yesterday as I guess my mouth or throat is getting sorer each day and I cannot eat without taking advil or Tylenol first. I see you had the same thing unklewifeonty. I was so worried that I had contracted my daughter's mono, so I slipped into work early(as my second week I work from home to avoid all those swine flu patients1) and my friend, the nurse practitioner saw me and said she didn't  see anything there. But it is so painful, so they brought me in, hydrated me and called in the magic mouthwash. Hopefully it will go away already!  Still have bottom issues also, I am going ok, no more constipation, but these hemmoroids are killing me!  Never left from the get go after that first bad experience. What a pain in the ass they are :)! Just keep treating them nicely and hopefully they will disappear. My levels were extremely low, so I was advised to stay home next couple of days. So I will. I had a breast MRI done Wednesday, the oncologist has not called yet with the results, but i have seen a copy already (working for a doctor has its benefits!) and I am bummed that my tumor is 5 cm! i guess it has grown or i guess I am hoping that they were wrong in the first place. My axilla node has shrunk according to the report to 1.4 from 3 cm.  I will just wait to see how this is all explained. I cried a little, wondering maybe if I should now be up a bit in the staging, but feel much betterr now, so many people battle worse cancers! I loves to hear you all describe the chemo room, our is open, and widepread and the two nurses are very friendly, it is mostly older, but there are young people there, yesterday there was a twenty year old young man with down syndrome who took it like a professional and left with a lollipop, how brave must he be!  Somedays its so feisty and others its a snooze fest! I prefer the feisty days. Anyway, thinking of each and every one of you,and good luck to you who are moving on to Taxol. Please all have a great weekend! ",

Well, really just him, they were nervous! Traumatizing, yes, but my daughters filmed it on the computer and then they put music to it so we have a home video!  They were great!  Still have eylashes and eyebrows. Yea!

I was never so happy to see the tubes and inserts and specially medicated wipes. I feel better already.

When I got there, they were changed. I had been to the ocno on Friday, and when i asked abut the chemo meds, the Taxol and Gemzar addition, she told me she still had to consult with some colleagues she knew at Dana Farber, so Gemzar was still up in the air. I was happy to hear that they were looking out for me and called twice yesterday and spoke to the nurse, to see if any new orders were in yet, but she did not let me know by 5:30. When I got to the treatment area, they took my blood and then went into a tizzy as they discovered there were new orders for Cisplatin and Docetaxel (Taxotere) just placed this morning after they reviewed the Taxol orders.I had no emend with me and had taken all these premeds ad this treatment is 7 hours at least, maybe 8 the first time. What a waste! They had to find the onco and they rescheduled me for monday. My wbc was so good and i am so happy that I can have a nice Thanksgiving and weekend with my family. Yah!  Not thinking about the new side effects until I have to, apparently they are much worse. I am scheduled for treatment every three weeks which will now push surgury off to much later. I don't even know how many treatments I will be getting. But if it will help me, bring it on! Scooby, i did use the biotene often, but got sores anyway. Now I use the mgc mthwsh four time daily...seems I may be doomed as one of my new chemo meds causes mouth sores!  Lisa, love your attitude after so much went wrong. Still looking forward to that finish line, although I my come in last place!! Onty, seems like there are more pro's than con's. That is a good thing. This may be a blessing in disguise. But what the heck is \"gross wall motion abnormality visible\"? Is it related to the cancer or is it side effect of the chemo? Hopbird- I think cooking for Thanksgving will be theraputic. I am looking forward to immersing myself in that kitchen with all of those good smells for as long as my body will allow, will keep my mind off things. i hope you and everbody feels good tommorow!

Thought my diet was perfect, apparently not.  Please God that that never happens again. I thought I was going to die. I guess I did not take enough stool softners, only one at night and so now was told by the nurse to completely avoid any brown rice even if it has fiber, which I did not know. I was very nervous about the after pain and my surgeon offered to look for me to make sure I was not torn. Lucky I was not, just very irritated. I had no other naseau, a little tired here and there,do not sleep at night so well, but all in all not too terrible. I got the Neulasta shot the day after in my forearm and  then my affected breast and my underarm where I know I have affected nodes was very painful.  Still feel it now and then.Very hopeful that this is chemo working.  Next treatment Wed and will start prepping properly tommorow.  My period is due very soon. Wondering if I am going to get it? Wishing you all a good week..",

Melinda, I eat probiotic yogurt every day, I am interested in what you find out about that brand. I was reccommended to do a masectomy, but I will be pushing for both to go for sure. Why not? I just feel that I have no idea why or when this came up so, so fast and who's to say it can't happen again. As I cannot take the drugs afterward, I must prevent reoccurance any way I can.

She is 14 so she understands. I lysol everything evey morning and use my antibacterial when out.  Just curious, what foods are meant to boost white blood cell count?",
