My escape place would be somewhere with water -- maybe a cruise or even just a nice lounge chair at Orange Beach.  Something about the water is just so relaxing. My husband spent almost a year in Iraq and informed me then to go to the beach while he was gone because he never wanted to see another speck of sand so I don't think that is where I'll get to recover in the real world.  But I can go there in my mind -- with the right drugs and a fruity cocktail!",

Please pray for travel safety for my family (2 1/2 hr drive from home) and for all of our medical teams. I know you're praying for me -- I can feel it. Many thanks and God bless.",

So -- as far as the doctors (I'll have 3 surgeons working on me) and hospital go I'm ready! For me, however, not so much.  Need to get the house cleaned, hire a housekeeper, buy pjs, bras and such; pack, cook and freeze some meals, etc. etc. If any of you find the \"Easy Button\" that will take care of all of this for all of us, please share!  LOL",

I am scheduled to have pre-op on Tuesday (Sept 27).  Then I'm scheduled to check in to Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville at 5:30 a.m. on Thursday, Oct. 13 with surgery to begin at 7:30 p.m.  I've been told to expect surgery to take about 10 hours; to be in the hospital for about a week; no driving for 3 - 4 weeks and off work for about 6 weeks. I was diagnosed with BC in January 2008 and hada mastectomy of the right breast followed by 16 rounds of chemo and 37 rounds of radiation -- throw a blood clot in there and you have my 2008. So now the plan is to do a prophylactic mastectomy on the left and a double DIEP. Every day it seems I come up with something else I need to get done before the surgery...need to make a list and get to work on it -- I'm 18 days and counting!!",
