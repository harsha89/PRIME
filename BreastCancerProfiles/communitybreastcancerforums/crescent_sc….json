    "Content": "Jan 24, 2012 07:57AM - edited Jan 24, 2012 08:05AM by crescent_scars I had DCIS in my right breast and BMX in September, 2010, followed by expanders and silicone implants later.  I went the opposite of you, skylar, going from a large C to a large B.  Liking the smaller girls.  Aside from the phantom itching now and then, no complaints.  I don't mind my baldies, and have procrastinated getting tattooes.  Did not opt for nipple reconstruction because I can go without a bra, so what was the point of that?!  I'm getting tattoos on Feb. 1st only because my breast surgeon and oncologist strongly encouraged it, saying the trompe l'oeil effect would fool my mind, and the tattoos would cover part of the scars.  I want the lightest, most subtle, skin-toned nipples ever tattooed.  Just barely a hint.  Does that sound silly? I hope your bulges continue to diminish, dazed.",
