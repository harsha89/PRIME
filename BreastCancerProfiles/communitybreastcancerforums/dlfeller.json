I got really burnt and had to take a week off, had to get the cream that the burn patients get, i was really in bad shape and raw sunburn, I had 9 treatments left and i started getting nausiated and had a headache. i tuffed it out  and i am now 7 weeks with no treatments but I have a heavyness of the chest and shortness of breath. I have told this to the dr and he just said we have to watch this. I had bloodwork done and my white cells are low. i am tired and some days feel like I've run a marathon and im at the end but the end never comes. usually by noon to 1pm i am ok but after that I am done for the day! my husband can't figure out why i am so tired. this really drains you. My nausia is pretty much gone but the headaches come back when i get warm but not as seviere as before. How long will these symptons last and the Drs. don't seem concerned. My concern is the fatique and the heavy ness /short winded. am I going to have a heart attack it sure feels like it sometimes. that's the real scare. any input would be appreciated thanks.",

WOW the dr has put me on resperdone  every 8 hours it works to some extent but i can tell when it's time for another one. I feel like a balloon ready to pop, like I need to put on more weight! LOL my dr told me their was side effects of radiation but they never tell you the severty of them. I have a friend that her friend has gone thru this and her symptoms are the same as the rest of us. and now it has affected her heart.  I do believe  the beems do more damage to the surronding areas they treated. the beems just don't stop in a certain area they do go beyond the area being treated. Has anyone else had heart problems since radiation treatments? these surprises just keep coming. Is their any disability available for us that have on going symptoms from the cancer/radiation? Many other people qualify for disability shouldn't we be able to get it? I have never had breathing problems. If their is anyone out there that can get me info I would greatly appreciate it. I am not alone. good luck to all of you this is a really tough  disease! My radiation was really tough I got burned bad, they put me on the cream that burn patients get in the burn units. also, in the Peru, Illinois area their is a group of cops that do cops for cancer. they are cops that have loved ones with cancer they put together a group with a medical board you apply and you can get some help with, expenses, gas. utilities etc. they are wonderful!!!! so please go to their web site cops for cncer peru Ill and see if you qualify!! ",
