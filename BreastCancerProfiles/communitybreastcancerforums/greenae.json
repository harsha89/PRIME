Am dreading the MRI, because I tried to climb out of the neck MRI I had last year. Crazy, right? I am so happy so many are on here full of good thoughts, knowledge and advice. I cannot seem to get this off my mind for more than 10 minutes. Don't feel like sleeping or eating. And I know better. So, I plan to get some strength from all of you, if that's ok? The lack of control over this is second only to the waiting. Several times a day since this \"detour in my life\" began 2 weeks ago, I feel on the edge of a panic attack. Trying to keep it together in front of family, friends and co-workers. AND I FEEL FINE! just scared. ",

(lol) It's raining so hard, I may skip the gym, and instead finish my Spin recert, and organize my binder. Bridgegal, I spoke with the radiologist who read the mammos, and performed the 2 US's and the core biopsy. My report, so far, says Malignancy, 8mm at 10:00, IDC with cells \"moderately differentiated.\" Three core specimens removed and a marker placed. She said something about a \"6,\" so I made the assumption (perhaps incorrect?) that it is Grade 2. The complete report is not yet available, and I will be all over that later this week. Part of me wants to know this minute, and part of me wants to forget about all this for today. I am having the opposite problem with eating. I am not hungry and have lost 5 lbs since 12/29/14. The only good so far, as I could stand to lose 5 more. I am going into the city from Staten Island because 2 family members have been pts at NYU, and their care was Excellent. My husband is retired, so I have a driver, and I am so lucky to have 3 sisters and 3 close friends who will help me through this. I am the first-born, bossy, know-it-all big sister so I can't let this get me down or mess up my role in our family dynamic. I have lived through the loss of a child...this is nothing compared to that. Gonna put on my Wonder Woman costume (ok, not really-lol) and beat this crap!",

Turned out I have a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, no uterine ca. Weird at my age. Told gyn, let me get a mammo while I am at this testing...so now she takes credit for catching the BC, and wouldn't give a referral for a biopsy?? So I get the whole comfort with the MD's issue. So important. I must be able to trust my Healthcare Provider. I see the surgeon in 11 days. I hope I am comfortable with her. I will be going to NYU.

That will keep your wbcs up. I take claritin for 3 days, to help counteract the bone achiness/painthat I feel for a few hours on day 5 and 6. All of the nausea meds (zofran at home for 3 days, compazine if I need ( i havent), have kept me from feeling sick. I try to get in 30 min a day of exercise, even if I am tired. I think the fluids and exercise are the keys to beating the SEs. For metal mouth use biotine toothpaste and mouthwash.

I still have most of my hair, and all eyebrows, lashes. A friend gave me Lash and Brow Gel, by Brian Joseph. Two of her friends used it thru-out chemo and for 60 days after, and did not lose lashes or brows. All natural ingredients, sold online. I am hoping it works! If not, both of my wigs have long bangs, lol. I am getting a buzz cut tomorrow, because I need control over something! I feel pretty lucky. I only felt lousy for 5 days, with headaches, bad metal mouth, fatigue and one night of back pain. I am hoping round 2 goes as well. I am hoping everyone is feeling ok? And allecat, you should call if you have pain, let them give you the EMLA, or at least advise. We have enough pain with all we have to deal with. Jeeze, my TE, the thing that is going to make me look \"all better\" when this is done, drives me crazy sometimes, so I hit the Motrin, for sure. And I saved post surgical meds for any pain emergencies. I dont like taking meds, but they can sure help. Hoping all have minimal pain and SE day, Arlene And dont forget anyone can register and go to Look Good Fee Better, and get free tips and make-up. Register online. My session is 4/14. And I hear its all good brand stuff. My 2 wigs are above. I have been dyeing my grays since I am 35, so today just may be my last day ever as a brunette (except for wig days), I think gray/blonde will be my new color when it grows back.",

I had 4 hrs of back and leg pain on day 7, and motrin 600mg took care of it. Drink 80oz of fluid a day that first week. My biggest prob was headaches and dry eyes. I wear contacts and had to use glassesa few days. Genteal Gel works great for eyes. I had to see opthalmalogist for the eye presure( have glaucoma) and he also gave me Restasis. Take a colace every day for constipation. I found a cool nail color from Revlon, Intrepid, dark teal, surprised I like it!and have dark metallic purple on toes. Buzz cut on day 16. I will try to add helpful hints as I remember them. So far, it has not been as bad as I anticipated. I think the Decadron is the worst part, and am kind of dreading that feeling come this wed. But the decadron is what makes us ok for the first 3 days on TC. I wish you all good luck and Hugs! And i am hoping second round no worse than the first? I can deal with 1 rough week and two decent.

The first fill was 400cc at mx, then 50cc every 2 weeks til I got to 600cc. I had the fills during chemo. No biggie. A little soreness and heaviness, i took a valium at night if the spasms kept me up. The implant is a lot more cmfortable. I am happy to have the Alloderm keeping it where it belongs. Lol. Good luck with your recon plans! Arlene",

I roll them under my feet before sleep, for about 45 minutes. It has helped a great deal. Heat makes it much worse for me. In the first couple of months after chemo, even showering made it act up. After I finished showering I would stand in Cold water for about 10 minutes, to stop the burning. Those first few months I tripped many times because I couldn' tell where my feet were. It has gotten so much better this past few weeks. My last Infusion of TC was May 38th. I hope yours improves Soon! Hugs! Arlene I also think returning to Spin class made a difference---the first class was pretty uncomfortable 2 weeks ago, but last night's was great",

I have the metal mouth, irritated Chia Pet scalp, gassiness at times, Decadron craze for 3 days, then really tired on Day 4, and achey hips, femurs and lower back on Day 7 after infusion. My biggest complaint is horribly dry and painful eyes, and 3 bouts of scleritis. I am going to forego contacts for a few days and see if that helps. I just thought I would share my Onco NP, RN and MD's advice. But I think, especially based upon what I read here and on other Chemo threads, (the people with the least SEs seem to be doing a lot of the same things?) that the keys to fighting the SEs are hydration and exercise. Here's the advice I was given: Drink 64-80 oz of any non-caffeinated beverage each day ( I drink 1 cup of coffee in the am. That's a \"minus\" drink, because it dehydrates) Exercise 30 minutes a day----garden, walk, run, bike, do laundry, vacuum, anything to get your heart pumping Rinse with the baking soda, water, salt mixture Every time you go in the bathroom (16 oz water with 3/4 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking soda-leave in a water bottle in bathroom, change daily) Biotene toothpaste and mouthwash No Lysine, as per my MO Brach's Lemon drops Colace, once or twice a day, as needed, first week after infusion, or whenever Mucinex--( no D, or DM, etc) for chest, head, sinus congestion (I had bloody \"snot\" and a tight cough for a week after the first round) Cleocin Lotion Rx---of course I got acne all over chin and cheeks, at 57 years old Ativan Rx--0.5 to 1mg the day of infusion, and for the really bad nights or day, helps with nausea, too No alcohol for 4 days before or after infusion---and then 2-3 drinks per week...for life. Eat small meals every 2-3 hours for 3-4 days starting with infusion day Dove Liquid Soap for scalp and body, I scrub those loose hairs off my head, and it feels so much better Satin pillowcases Scrub fruits and veggies clean before eating, no lettuce... and no cold foods from restaurants or take-out, including cold cuts or sliced meats, cheeses, no unpasteurized foods or raw fish (And of course the 3 days of Decadron, Zofran and Claritin (the plain Claritin) at infusion time) I know all of this is so difficult for all of us. This whole BC thing feels like a full-time job, sometimes. I want to cry when I read every day how so many of you have young children, have to go to work, deal with these sucky SEs, feel like we look like Sh$T, yet have others tell us how Good we look! UGH. I can't wait to feel normal again. My tight and achey Tissue Expander being pumped up every 2 weeks never lets me forget. I dream of being able to sleep on my left side again. And again, I am \"lucky\" because it was a unilateral MX. But I don't want to complain, and I try so hard to remain upbeat and positive. I hope everyone on here can find days where they can forget these SEs for a bit and just feel good. I think of all of you all the time...and send hugs and hopes for CRUSHING these SEs. Love, arlene PS I have broken the rules...I posted this on the March and April threads because you are both my chemo buddies...I hope it helps?",

I have no complaints, and have been Very happy with my team, (BS, MO, and PS), and the Perlmutter Center. They were my first, and only opinion, as I had read about Dr Axelrod, and have had family treated and hospitalized at NYU, and as an RN, I was impressed. (And I worked at NYH-Cornell, in the 80's). I wish you good luck with your choices and treatments. I think both centers are probably equally as good; you should be comfortable with your docs and plan. Ask me and anyone on BCO anything! We are here for you and each other. I would say most of us agree that the time between dx and treatment beginning,is probably the hardest. You are already on a good path .
