I had very low WBC/RBC/Hemoglobin after my first chemo & my onc would not let me go back to work. I couldn't concentrate so book reading was out but read/looked at lots of magazines. The best thing I did was maintain a blog on blogspot.com (which is free). My friends & co-workers could keep up with my progress & send me notes. I discovered I really enjoyed writing and most of it was humorous (even w/BC the topic!). I'd only written business materials prior to my blog. I've taken an online creative writing class and still enjoy writing. Just tossing out a suggestion. I had so many appts. between med onc, surgeon, rad onc and treatments & surgery that the time off work really went fast.",
