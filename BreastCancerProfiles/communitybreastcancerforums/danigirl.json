I'm going to these guys to GET the answers, not GIVE them!  You will be seeing these doctors over and over again, so make sure to get the one who gives you some modicum of comfort that you are doing the right thing.",

      "Content": "Feb 8, 2009 04:48PM - edited Feb 8, 2009 04:54PM by danigirl Hi, I have been going to Dr. Mitchell Gaynor since 2007.  I was diagnosed with DCIS stage l no lymph nodes.  Because my oncotype dx test was on the cusp of high, I decided to  go for chemotherapy at Columbia Presbyterian.  However, I have always been health oriented, and I was scared to take supplements on my own because I  had read that certain vitamins could interfere with chemo.  I had read about Dr. Gaynor, who is an integrative oncologist, and decided to go see him . Incidently, he was the only doctor my oncologist at Columbia would let me go to, so he must have a decent rep up there.  He is not only extremely thorough, but he is a great guy to ask questions that you may  have forgotten to ask your own oncologist.  He is on the Komen board, is associated with Weill-Cornell, and is a fountain of knowledge.  He also devotes enough time to you so that you never feel you're just wasting money.  I truly believe he kept me a lot healthier that I otherwise would have been through my chemo.  AND he IS an oncologist--on certain days his office is filled with patients getting chemo. He does not accept insurance, but I pay and then submit it to my insurance company--it pays back about half.  I still see him. He's on 72nd on the east side.Good luck.",
