My massage therepist is trained in lymphatic drainage, and says there is very little pressure with lymph massage...no mor pressure than putting a nickle on your skin. That doesnt seem like that would be and issue. I apply more pressure when I but lotion on in  the morning.   I'd love to hear from anyone else about what they think. Take Care, Krissy",
