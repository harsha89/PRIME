The doctor could not remove more nodes because they were too close to the artery and nerves but thought they were cancerous. Her liver, bone and lung scans were negetive. Is it normal not to be able to remove all the cancer with surgery and get it with chemo and radiation? Thank you Log in to post a reply",
