A little over a year ago I too found a lump (Feb 11th, 2009).  Long story short: an MRI after my biopsy happened to catch a bit of imaging of my liver with a suspicious lesion.  PET/CT scan with contrast a week later showed 3 tumors in liver, multiple tumors in lungs, and lymph nodes that also lit up as well.  Like you, I was also triple positive: Pro, Estro, & Her2 pos.  My oncologist stepped in before I ever had surgery.  He didn't feel he needed a liver biopsy because of the multiple lessions, he didn't need to subject my body to it, he wanted me into chemo immediately. I was diagnosed metastatic March 18th, and started chemo March 27th, but didn't get my port installed until the 30th. I started with Herceptin and Taxotere, 6 rounds spaced three weeks apart.  I also got injections of Nuelasta after each infusion session. Here's why I wanted to write: every case of cancer is indeed unique, and yes being metastatic off the starting block seriously sucks.  But as a triple positive patient you have, as my onc would put it, \"a lot of tools in the tool box\".  Herceptin worked wonders for me, though I know it's not for everyone.  By the time of my second infusion of Herceptin, only three weeks after the first dose, the lump in my breast could no longer be felt by palpating, it had essentially dissolved away.  By the END of chemo most of my lung mets had dissapeared or shrunk, and the liver mets no longer \"lit up\" in the PET/CT scan.  Of course, this doesn't mean I'm off the cancer bus: as a mets patient I'll continue to pay my fare for this ride, managing this \"chronic disease\" for the rest of my life. My best wishes for you, I will thinking good thoughts, hoping that this is a club you won't have to join. PS: I think it's always worth it to ask for second opinions, even if only because you might find someone who can explain your options to you in a better way, so that you understand what your primary docs are aiming for.  Most breast cancer centers also have social workers or nurse coordinators who can help you navigate and talk through your options.  As a younger woman facing cancer you will have other issues to consider, like protecting your fertility?, which you may want to make sure your doctors are taking into consideration.  Hugs!",
