Well over a year ago I had an ultrasound on my left breast due to a lump that was find near the ribcage. Turned out to be a cyst, thank heavens. About four months later, the same breast began to itch like mad and swelled up due to the itching. I saw my doctor and she said it was hormones. The itching went on for quite some time but always got better after I treated it was AD ointment. And then it just stopped. That same breast has always been lumpy and hard my own life and someone mentioned to me ages ago that it was possible that that the breast was fibrocystic. Six months later, it came back, coupled with clear spontaneous nipple discharge. Back to my doctor I went. She again said it was nothing to worry about, didn't want to send me for tests because I was not presenting with a lump and the only other family history I had of breast cancer was my mother who had just been diagnosed with early stage 1. I changed doctors and saw two others. The gynecologist checked over my breast after I told him I had the clear nipple discharge and sent me on my way. He was no concerned at all. The other doctor, who is now my primary caregiver, seemed a bit concerned but still didn't want to send me for a mammogram because again, no lumps. She sent me for the BRCA test to see if I had the gene factor and that came back negative. Then the discharge went away and I haven't seen it again until now, Now I am WITHOUT the itching and the flaking and just slight clear spontaneous nipple discharge. I did have a bit of discharge out of the other nipple the last time this happened but nothing this time. Because this has been going on for well over a year, these strange symptoms on and off and no one seems to want to send me for tests, should I worry? I'm not too worried right now, a health expert that I saw who suffered from BC herself said it sounded to her like I was experiencing a lot of hormonal stress reactions due to the the deaths of my sister and father and my mom's cancer. I would think that if this was cancer, it definitely would have progressed to something much worse by now. And right now, if I hadn't noticed the stain on my bra I wouldn't even know I had the discharge. Any thoughts? Thank you. Log in to post a reply",
