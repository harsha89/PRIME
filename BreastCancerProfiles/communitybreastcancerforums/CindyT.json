So I have to decide between MX, LX, BMX.  We don't know if I have a MX if I will need rads until after the surgery.  No lymph node involvement shows on the MRI or US, but of course it could be microscopic.  So of course radiation can cause complications with reconstruction after MX or if I have a LX with a signifignant defect there won't be much to do to fix it after rads.  So the decision is to keep my own breast knowing it may not look very good or a MX with reconstruction that may have a 50% complication rate if I need rads.  I see so many women having MX with immediate reconstruction, how do they know if they will need radiation or not?  I am so confused as to what to do!
