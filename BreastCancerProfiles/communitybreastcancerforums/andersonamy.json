I've been diagnosed with benign breast lumps in the past but I have found a new one and feel very nervous. I only want to enjoy my baby right now :( It basically feels like a garbanzo bean and is about that size as well. It wiggles when touched but feels like it's attached to some tissue. It's smooth and has about the exact firmness of the above mentioned chick pea. I've been through other medical problems this year so this is absolutely devastating to me. I'm scheduled to be examined on Monday but I'm not coping. Even though I've had benign lumps before, this one doesn't feel right to me. Here are my major concerns: what would be the benign possibilities here? Also, cysts and fibroadenomas seem more common in menstruating women. What about pregnant women? Can a cyst feel like a chick pea and be that size?? Is it possible to have them even though I haven't resumed my cycles yet?? I don't know what the hormonal differences are between pregnant women and menstruating women besides the obvious. PLEASE help... I'm so scared. I made the mistake of reading an article recently about postpartum breast cancer becoming more common. I always thought pregnancy was supposed to lower the risk if anything. It's so frustrating.
