Initially I was told tubular features but that disappeared from the surgical report. They werent expecting the positive node. I will say that my 2nd opinion pathology said the tumors were grade 2 vs grade 1 Eta: the results of the path report changed the anticipated tx plan in that they didn't get clean margins so I got radiation. The oncotype plus positive node added chemo. But to be fair, they said all along tx plan would depend on surgical pathology.",

For me, I had an MRI of both breasts and additional biopsies in each breast (2 of 3 biopsies were benign findings so don't panic if they do want to biopsy more...the other finding was another tumor in the same breast but finding it really didn't impact my prognosis although it did mean mastectomy vs lumpectomy). Then after the surgical pathology report and oncotype my adjuvant tx was determined. I never had any body scans or blood work at all at stage 2 with one node. My MO won't do anything unless I have symptoms but I know other doctors work differently. I've heard Dana Farber tries to schedule testing all together so you don't have so much disruption. All the appts are like a FT job in itself, and its tough when you are also parenting young kids... hang in there, you will all get through it. I had a great second opinion consult at Dana Farber but that was post surgery so while they reviewed my pathology slides, I myself didn't need to do any testing. Best wishes.",

The surgeon told me he prefers to do ports before tx starts because the body heals better and he also told me that my vein (artery? Cant remember which) was possibly to small and he might have to go deeper for a bigger vein, which also increases risk of complications...so I was a bit scared before surgery. Fortunately surgery was easy and I healed really well. There are risks to port surgery but mine went well and I suspect most do. However if you are concerned have you talked about the possibility of IV infusion? Again for me IV didn't work well but for others it may. Best wishes.",

I may have posted this yesterday but I got my haircut into a short bob.  My three year old said she didnt like it!  (She's into long princess hair). Oh well, its only temporary anyway!

Tx went well yesterday.  Felt fine during it.  The Adriamycin irritated my vein and so they had to start a different iv for the Cytoxan.  Funny thing was that I didnt feel any pain or irritation but my skin got all red and starting getting bumps near the iv.  Once they flushed it out and gave an ice pack it went stopped right away.  Feeling ok this morning.  Was fairly nauseous last night, but tolerable.  Took the meds this am and feeling better.  Getting my haircut later this morning. Welcome ml14333! Question for you ladies-  how open are you/do you plan to be with acquaintances about going thru chemo?  Im not trying to put it out there neccessarily but I find when people ask questions (what made you decide to cut your hair short?) I find I cant come up with anything better than Im going thru chemo.  Not that I mind being open (and I certainly do need to go into detail), I just dont want to make people I dont know real well feel awkward ( theyve seemed ok thus far).  Would love to hear what you all are planning to do.",

How are you doing now?  I'll be on Taxol once I'm done with the 4 ACs.  I think I'm doing 4 dd though and not 12. Trekgirl - glad to hear that the finding was a cyst. Leto - sorry that it seems like they are leaning toward mastectomy.  I had mine in July (it stinks but yet is also doable).  Is the thinking that the neoadjuvent treatment will shrink it and give you options for a lumpectomy?  (wishing you the best!) Having a nice weekend here; went to a local festival called \"Honkfest\" - a festival of activist street bands.  It was a blast and the kids enjoyed it too.  The music was very fun and energizing and the crowd was a blast.  Very family-friendly.  Then, today was apple picking.  Trying to make the most of things as well as squeeze in errands and chores. So, definitely tired.   I hate my recent haircut, I've decided.  It was a very poor haircut and I look 10 years older and also way more dowdy.  I'm almost eager for my hair to fall out so I can put on my wig (which still has yet to arrive so I'm getting a bit worried about that). Hope everyone is recovering from this week's chemo nicely and everyone else is enjoying their weekend!",

I was just hoping to read! I'm getting my skull prosthesis prescription on Sept 30, when I meet with my my doctor next.  I doubt I'll have time to get out to any wig shops, but I've been searching online and watching reviews on youtube.  Focusing my research on wigs is distracting me from researching chemo side effects anyway...I did, however, order some hats already.  They are designed for chemo patients so they provide a lot of coverage over the hairline and nape.  I live in the Northeast and I want to be warm walking my kindergartner to school every morning.  It's already getting chilly in the morning. Speaking of kids, do either of you have young kids?  If so, have you thought about what you'll be telling them? I have a 5 year old and a 3 year old.  I'm not sure how they'll react to the baldness.",

For me, that was true... I know that many people don't feel comfortable sharing their diagnosis early on, although I did find one huge benefit: survivors come out of the woodwork to support you and I found people that could play the role of navigator for me! Plus of course everyone on the board here will support you through this. Just ask away!",
