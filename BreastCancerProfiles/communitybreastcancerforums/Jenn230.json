I was diagnosed with stage III triple negative breast cancer in Oct 2012 at the age of 31 and while 26 weeks pregnant. I opted for a double mastectomy, which I had on Nov. 12th, while still pregnant. We also put skin expanders in at that time (ouch!) My surgeon and plastic surgeon both felt confident that they got all of the tumor, they also removed 8 lymph nodes. However my path report came back saying I did not have clear margins on all sides. It also stated that all my lymph nodes were clear, however when we originlly biopsied one swollen lymph node it showed cancer. This really confused me! My surgeon says the tumor in my breast sat right up against the muscle, which is why that margin was not clear. I was then induced a month early, gave birth to a perfect baby girl on NYE. Three days later I had my port put in place and four days after that I had my first round of chemo. Right around Christmas I felt another swollen lymph node. My surgeon felt it and spotted it with an ultrasound, however after beginning the chemo it has gone down to the point that none of us can feel it. My surgeon says after radiation he will still remove it. I have now had 7 rounds of chemo 4 A/C 3 taxol, with one more taxol to go. Then I will begin 6 weeks of radiation. Last week I had an ultrasound on my heart due to the fact that I had a fast pulse. The heart scan came back good. BUT they saw a spot on my liver. Needless to say I am terrified. The Oncogist says the spot is large, and fluid filled. He doesn't seem that concerned but he's kinda hard to read. He said that cancer is rarely fluid filled and cysts are common, especially after pregnancy. He's ordered a CT scan for Wed. I am a nervous wreck. Does anyone have any words of wisdom, or similar stories? I just feel like I haven't gotten any good news yet and I could really really use some. Thanks so much Jenn",
