I had a good run 2002 to 2016 being cancer free with annual check ups then mets in bone, brain, liver (70% involved, over 20 tumors - one with necrosis), lungs and lymph! Cancer had mutated from ER/PR positive, which we were treating, to triple negative- (apparently it happens in 30% of cases) I have been on chemo (first eribulin which did not work then xeloda which is working miracles.) I am still working full time, don't know till when. Keeping my spirits up but aware that the prognosis is dismal. I will live life to fullest. I like my work, love my husband (we married happily oblivious of recurrence then 3 weeks later bam!), am surrounded with friends, I am going on trips as much as I can so while I am not happy to check out early I am at a good place in my life and think, no better time. I will be 53 soon. Yes, I will get ripped off by a couple of decades on my life expectancy. I like to think that will give someone else the extra years to even out the statistics. Hope you can manage true happiness in this period. Best wishes!   ",
