She is 38 years old and very healthy otherwise. Met with surgeon who would like to use neoadjuvant treatment. She will undergo chemo immediately, followed by surgery and then radiation. Curios to hear thoughts from others who had chemo first and how this process has worked for them. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
