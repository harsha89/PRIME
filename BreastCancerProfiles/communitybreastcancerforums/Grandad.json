    "Content": "Grandad wrote: My wife of 45 years has just been diagnosed with breast cancer. She is to have her operation on the 15/06/2011. She is very positive with her thoughts but i am at a bit of a loss to know what to do next. We have talked about the cancer openly and our two daughters are really supportive. The future seems unclear and we have heard in the past heard that chemo is the part of the illness that can really take its toll on a person. The hospital and doctors were very empathic but the future is something that is concerning. Can anyone shed a light on what to expect.Â  Log in to post a reply",
