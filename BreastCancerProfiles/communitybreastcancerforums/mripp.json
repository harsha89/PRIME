Anyway, it was all good and actually gave me more peace of mind before rad started. That was my experience but others may agree or disagree.",

My decision was easy when we talked recurrence %'s after rad tx (50% down to 2-3%) and SE out weighed survival. Everyone's SE can be different but again weighing short term and lond term risks made it clear for me. And as my RO and BS said there are 1,000's of studies so don't be frightened by what just one says and trust your medical team. That's what I did and I am confident in my doctor's decisions. I hope you ask everything you need to know and find peace. I am 17 days post rad tx and my skin ànd lx site are healed and looking great. I still have some fatigue by evening, but am doing great! Hope yours goes as well and (((hugs))). We're all here for you!",

First the cream lightly rubbed in, then the Aquafor dabbed on. I also got some of the largest non stick but semi absorbant gauze pads I could find and I carefully placed on my underarm near my breast fold to 1) cover the Aquafor ointment and 2) keep rubbing from clothing, bra, cami or whatever off my most sensative area. Did that for the whole time plus post rad until all healed up. I also cut soft flannel squares that I used at the beginning to cover the area, but switched to the gauze later. My RO said on 2 week post rad to use the aloe and vit d cream for 1 year. Still doing it and plan on keeping it up!",
