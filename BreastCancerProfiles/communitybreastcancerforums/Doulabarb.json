Yesterday they Dr. who did the biopsy called me and said we tested 3 areas of your breast. The one on the bottom of your breast was negative, the lymph node was negative and the spot on the top (which I could clearly feel the lump) was positive for breast cancer. SO my oncologist called almost immediatly. I have CLL so I already have an oncologist. She said she would like to see me Monday morning at 9,which seems so far away.She also mentioned that the size was 14 ml. large and asked me if I knew which surgeon I would like to see. I am very nervous but strong. I cry when I need to than it passes for a while. I am so glad I found this site so I can read stories from people who can relate. One thing that makes me sad is the way my son and sister are taking it,they are so up and make me feel worse than I already am feeling.I feel sad for them. If that makes any sence. In any case my biggest question right know is if I request my biopsy report do they have to fax it to me? Thank-You and God Bless all of you ! Barbara",
