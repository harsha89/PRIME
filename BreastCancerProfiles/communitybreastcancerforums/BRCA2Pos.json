My Mum died of ovarian cancer 11 years ago.  We were so shocked and totally in the dark about cancer.  We had no idea that was any kind of genetic test out there or that it was even hereditary.  Then just last August, my older sister (51) was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer. She took a genetic test which showed she was BRCA-2+.  I took the test & I also have the mutation.  My sister's cancer has once again spread, now to her lungs. She is fighting, but we are all scared for her, I'm not sure she will survive this. I decided that I wanted to do preventative surgery, I am 48.  I have had a HYST/OOPH on June 9 & am recovering well from that. It was done laprascopically which was great, not to much pain.  I am schuduled for a double mastectomy with expanders on July 28.  (EEK)  I am 100% sure this is the right thing to do.  If I can lower my percentage for getting this dread disease, I'll do whatever I can.  My husband & son (9) are great which makes it even easier.  I want to be around for a long time & can't live month to month waiting to see if I am the next one in the family to get cancer.  I hope my younger sister at least takes the test, she is 44 and has not done anything yet.  I just couldn't do that, I feel this is what I need to do without a doubt. :) Log in to post a reply",
