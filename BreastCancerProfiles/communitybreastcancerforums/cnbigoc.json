Had BC on 1 side showing 4 individual 2cm modules. Had 1 Lymph node effected also. Surgery took everything and 3 lymph nodes only original node showed microscopic cancer cells because I had such a good reaction to the chemo. Cancer all gone...  NOW... with only 1 lymph node and both breasts gone because I don't ever want to go through this again, OC is leaving rads up to me. OC says anywhere between 1-3 lymph nodes it's a toss up of RADS is needed... RO spouts off hospital policy that everyone should have rads, and I would need 18 treatments. I hear that it's a peice of cake, but then OC said stuff about long term damage and bad reactions some have. It's a risk, and what is it really going to do for me. RO said that it increases the cure of my current cancer by 10%. That seems like a lot of risk for not much gain. What do others think about RADS... and if it was up to you... what would you do? would you do rads again?",
