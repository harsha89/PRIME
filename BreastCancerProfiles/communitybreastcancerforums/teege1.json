I had cording for a few weeks in my left arm but that resolved. Since about 6 months out I have had occasional pins and needles and numbness in my right hand and arm below my elbow. It seems to be coming more often now even a few times a day and is annoying as hell. Not sure what to make of it or what, if anything, to do about it",

      "Content": "Nov 18, 2016 03:58PM - edited Nov 18, 2016 04:00PM by teege1 tiffany411, I have had various problems over the years and the one that comes to mind first is a bladder infection for 2 years. During my last appt with the local urologist he told me I needed to go on my 19th dose of antibiotics. I refused. The next day I made an appointment at the MAYO Clinic in JAX. It was the best decision I have ever made. No more infection. What I am saying is that you need to have a second opinion at a major medical facility that will go over everything and put it all together. I was diagnosed with IBC in Feb 16 by my family doc I have known and trusted for over 20 years. I told him I wanted a second opinion and he set it up at Duke in Durham, NC I am so glad I did. They verified what my doc at home said and since then I have had bilateral mastectomies with DIEP flap reconstruction. Pleas pick a major medical facility like Duke and go for a work-up. Your insurance will pay for a second opinion. Good luck and God's blessings to you. I just read where you say you don't have any insurance. Weren't you able to get any under the Affordable Care Act? I am so sorry to hear that. I would say press on and demand better treatment from the place you are going. Don't give up.",
