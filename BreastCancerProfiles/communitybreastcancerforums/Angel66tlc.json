Yes I'm planning on asking the doctor tomorrow but of course knowing I have to go back for another is worrisome. I don't think it was anxiety -have had a couple of mri's before and I felt pretty calm for the most part. And when they took me afterwards for the us biopsy and injected more lidocaine I didn't have the same reaction.",

Boyfriend found a lump in right breast in May and went to doctor. Said it felt like a cyst but since I was due for my 6 month monitoring he advised to go. Came back ok but was still concerned so I consulted a breast specialist. She sent me for a MRI which showed to areas of concern - one in each breast and I was scheduled for a MRI guided biopsy on Thursday. After the scanning and contrast they brought me out to start the procedure with the right breast which had the lump I'm concerned about. Numbing hurt a little but not bad. She made the cut and was getting ready to do the second one when I started feeling nauseaous. Told they radiologist and she asked if I could hold on. Then I felt like I was going to pass out. They tried ammonia but it wasn't helping as a matter of fact it just got worse. They had to stop the test and wound up attempting the biopsy through ultrasound. Since the lidocaine was already in it and the scan was cloudy, they aren't 100% sure they got it. They could find they one in my left so now I have to go back for an MRI biopsy for the left and scan for the rig to make sure they got the right spot. I'm worried about the reaction I had at the first one and what if anything I can do to prevent that from happening?
