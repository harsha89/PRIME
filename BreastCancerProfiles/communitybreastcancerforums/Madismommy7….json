In my opinion, any kind of lump that shouldn't be somewhere on your body is eligible to be investigated!!!! You are NOT crazy one bit for having it checked out and if your doctor thinks you are than you need a new doctor!!!! I'm appalled they treated you like that with the head aches. It is probably nothing but please seek the answers to either catch it early or ease your mind that it truly is nothing. Good luck and please keep us posted!",

I think I'll make sure to let her know the surgery \"removed the cancer\" but the next step will be the medicine to make sure it stays gone. I just have to practice until I don't start to cry, because every time I talk about my daughter and telling her, I CRY!!! That probably won't help reassure her huh?

If you are not comfortable with the doctor you are seeing than I say switch doctors immediately. Any lump that shouldn't be there shouldn't be taken lightly in my opinion...... If you want further tests done than push for them!!! If nothing else, get yourself peace of mind!!!! I have faith it'll all be okay, statistically most lumps are just benign cysts or changes in the breast tissue....and it probably is good the doctor is not too concerned. BUT, 6 months is way too long to wait if you are really freaking out about it.....follow your instinct!!!! I'll say a prayer for you that it's absolutely nothing!!!!!! Hang in there!",

I had a BMX in mid-June and just got my path report this past week. I had 3 nodes taken out while on the table and all 3 tested negative (that flash freeze test) while I was laying there. Now, this past Tuesday at my follow up I got the news with my full report that one node came back positive, actually TWO did but the oncologist told me the micromet didn't count because it was .1 cm in greatest dimension, the other one says .5 cm in greatest and is listed as a \"macro met\" Is there a big difference and what is it??? And how did these two test negative and than end up positive, is that a normal occrance???? BS is recommending an axiliary dissection next but my oncologist has told me to hold off a week or so until I can meet with her and the BS on her team. Very confusing as to how the nodes all fall into play????? Or is every case different???",

Otherwise I'm not sure I'd want to go thru the whole losing hair, chemo SE's if it won't.....I was told it's my \"life insurance\" after my surgery.... I'm banking on that..... :0)",

If the CMF works the same as the TC I'd go for the no hair loss in a second.....unless there was son underlying s/e or something??? Good luck with your 3rd opinion....I hope it matches one of the other two!",

I went to the zoo yesterday and walked around with family yesterday, I ran my usual errands today and baked banana bread and made dinner, I cleaned the house on friday.... I guess I'm just confused and sitting here waiting and wondering..... Is it safe at day 7 to say I've dodged the s/e bullet??? All you ladies that have shaved your heads, I am SO proud of all of you.... I hope I have half your courage about a week from now. I know that's probably when my bottom will drop out?!? I'm sorry some of you are having some pretty crappy days lately.... I wish I could take it all away from all of us!!!! Better days are ahead, I just know it!!!! K....I'm off to catch up on everyone's weekends..... HUGS to all my August sisters!!!!",

I don't need it but was given the indications if I had it would have been a fairly fast transition. Flautalee.... Glad to hear tx2 went smoothly!!!! Hope you are feeling good today. I was told to add exercise to my daily life (I've never been into the gym much?) and have been walking atleast a few days a week....hopefully I can add a little more as I go but for now I'm content with my walks. They are also relaxing!!! :) Deb.Utah....the steroids from my first tx seemed to give me crazy energy too....I was cleaning, doing laundry, walked 2 miles the mornings after....I hope I experience that again this week with tx2....I have some closets I need cleaned out! :).

Have you been writing down what foods aren't as bad with that nasty taste??? Mine seems to stem from milk or cream based foods..... Pasta sauce (meat) has still been good and a little bit of spicy.... Jenn....you seem to be having a tough go at it this time too, I'm sorry!!!! :( and I will hope and pray for you that you can take your daughter trick or treating....I know how important it is for our kids. I've had the same thought myself, what if I can't.... Makes me sad!!! Hang in there!!!! Summergirl....I hear ya on the self confidence issues with the hair. Mines shedding like crazy this weekend and as much as I don't like my wigs, I better suck it up and get used to them because I know I'm going to have a hard time out in public in my scarves. I do grocery shop and do dinner out last night with my buzz cut but it's still MY hair.... Ya know?? Not for long... *sigh*",

I'm reading a book on kindle called \"Crazy Sexy Chemo Tips\", it's really good....a friend of mine also going through chemo recommended it because the author (and cancer patient) has a great outlook on the whole thing and is also very young when diagnosed like me and my friend (my friends only 30).....

I had NO clue what the different ones meant.... And so in my consult I had, I learned that \"lace front\" means it looks most like hair coming out of your scalp naturally.... Especially if you don't have bangs like me you would want a lace front wig. And than the Monofilament is the most \"natural\" feel on the scalp and allows the part to fall naturally on the wig for easiest styling. I tried on real hair and synthetic hair and went with the synthetic. There really was not a big difference in person I though, except the real hair was a little softer to the touch but hotter on my head..... And the synthetic wigs are easier to take care of....kind of a shake and go!!! Much more my thing. I tried on several of the brands that headcovers.com offers and the prices are pretty reasonable. I might order a \"fun\" one online with some scarves.... Maybe be a redhead sometimes? I've always wanted to be a redhead......oh, and I ordered a matching colored \"halo\" to wear under hats.... It looks ridiculous without a hat but was really cute (and looked totally real) with one. Anyways, just wanted to share because I honestly had no clue until yesterday.....and didnt even know where to start.",

Thanks so much ladies for all your wit and insight and support.... I'd be so lost without this forum and all of you.",

My hospital for treatment kind of segregates the different cancers by infusion stations.... So I'll have a good chance of having the same nurses, etc each time. That makes me happy!!! The clinical trial, yes...I need to really read up on that drug avastin, there's a 33.33% I'll end up on that path and I'll get avastin every 3 weeks for a whole year in between the chemo and the tamoxifen .....that's a pretty big extra commitment.

But than again, they all seem to have them huh?? I hope you start feeling better soon. Hang in there!!! Mary, I just noticed how similar our diagnosis is.... Which chemo cocktail are you doing? My local cancer center has the \"laughing\" class.... I was told about it, that it's a big group of people that do a bunch of laughing exercises and big belly laughs.... I was told they start laughing pretty much uncontrollably and mostly for no reason. I passed on signing up for that one, I love to laugh (even though it hurts with my chest lately) but I didn't see myself just laughing and laughing like that, for no reason.....I don't think it involved yoga at my center?? That would be interesting....",

My insurance is paying for one of my wigs and than I have bought two others online, one from wigs.com and one from tlc. My two other wigs look nothing like me normally, so I call them my alter ego wigs..... I also ordered a sleep cap and couple scarves from headcovers.com.

The Muga scan.....do the inject anything prior? Dyes? Can it go thru our port? Do I have to lay flat on my back and how long is the test? I don't think I can lay flat for long....stll uncomfortable with TE's. Treatment....can you FEEL the drugs going in and running thru your veins? This is a feeling I have panic attacks over, it really is unsettling to me. When I was in the hospital with the BMX and they would \"flush\" my IV it would make me lightheaded. Not sure I can sit there and FEEL that over and over without a panic attack? I'm weird, I know.... I think that's it for current mind racing questions....

They announce everything as they push them in and never heard a single one and there definitely weren't enough syringes???? I asked once I realized and they kind of dismissed the question??? I've needed more compazine already than I did last time....hmmm??? If I puke I'm gonna be MAD!!!! My hair is still hanging in there but I think it's a matter of time before my buzz cut is gone....I can grab ahold of it, barely pull and have a huge pinch....it's weird.

I was just informed of this and wanted to pass it on ASAP.... Make sure none of your close friends and family get the nasal flu shot this year and than are around you for the days following. Supposedly the spray consists of live bacteria and germs and can really get anyone with compromised immune systems really sick while it's \"active\". The regular shot is okay, it's just the nasal spray one that we need to be careful of. Yet another reason to feel like living in a bubble!!! UGH!!!!!",
