The afternoon of my PET scan I found out my liver was clear.  Whew!  Of course they said there would be more follow-ups after chemo (which I started March 1).  It sounds like these tests are pretty normal from what you are all saying.  Thank you so much for your encouragement!  I am just glad I finally passed a test!  Good luck to ALL of us!",
