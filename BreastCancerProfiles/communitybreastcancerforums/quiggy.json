We're all different and our journeys are unique, but only to a certain degree. Seems to me the standard of treatment and care across the USA is varied and sometimes lacking. I would expect difference across countries. Like many of you, I've researched countless hours and haven't seen anything like this. Lots of \"what to ask\" lists but nothing that TRULY addresses the things we must know or the truth about what we may face. I've seen the supposed research and been told by RO that RAD is pretty non eventful for most. No SE until 2-3 weeks and then minor burns and fatigue. Where's the rest of the information?",

I worry about death, health, pain and my mutilated body. I get up every day at 3-30 am, get ready for work (make up, hair, soft bra etc), then hit the freeway. After 8-9 hours, I drag my tired ass to treatment then home. I care how I look for me but also for my DH and family. I have Crohn's disease and had an ileostomy when I was 23, I'm 54 now. Health, body image etc., not my first rodeo. I've done this my entire adult life. Sometimes I wonder what else will be chopped off before I reach the end! But..... I make my way, found true love, have a successful career and every day I put one foot in front of the other and keep moving and living.",

Please share as you like. ___________________________________ NEW NORMAL You are certain to feel sheer joy and relief at the end of breast cancer treatment! Whew, you think, I finally made it to the end of a long and painful process! Ending treatment is definitely a reason to celebrate and you probably can hardly wait to return to life as \"normal!\" But, you may quickly find out that life as you knew it before treatment just isn't the same. Gone is the safety net of a team of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other means of support that are no longer there for you on a daily or weekly basis. Family, friends, and employers may have high expectations that you will be the same person you were before treatment. You will probably have the same high expectations of yourself. However, cancer is a life-altering experience and you will most likely be faced with establishing a new \"normal\" as a breast cancer survivor. 3A myriad of things may present themselves at the end of treatment and it's quite typical to go through an adjustment period. Experts estimate that it takes as long for you to rebound from treatment as it did for you to go through treatment. However, we are each different and it may take weeks, months, or even years to make the adjustment. It's myriad of things may present themselves at the end of treatment and it's quite typical to go through an adjustment period. Experts estimate that it takes as long for you to rebound from treatment as it did for you to go through treatment*. However, we are each different and it may take weeks, months, or even years to make the treatment. But there are also positive things that can happen at the end of treatment. You may appreciate life more, become more spiritual, change how you think about life, reduce your stress at work and at home, adopt healthier eating and sleeping habits, and you may even decide to channel your energy into becoming a breast cancer advocate or become a source of support to others who have been just diagnosed or are undergoing treatment. The biggest thing you need to give yourself is adequate time to heal and adjust. Be reasonable with your expectations and be kind to yourself.",

USA, well, if you're lucky and have \"good\" coverage, you likely pay well for it. Those in government aid get free or reduced care. I feel fortunate to have great coverage although I'm limited to the providers and care that my insurance will cover. I've received quick care for my bc, no waiting. I care for an elderly aunt, she's on Medicaid. They do not cover dentures. I've researched to find help, no luck. Her case worker said it's common for elderly to just shift to soft foods that don't require teeth. REALLY!!!! What's the answer?

Terrified of the SEs, specifically the bone thinning and joint pain. I promised myself I would start on May 1st. Its BS that we have to make this choice. Thinning bones is too serious for aging women and it's not reversible. The pain is frightening to me. I have rheumatoid arthritis and can't imagine adding to the pain. BUT.... I don't want more breast cancer so I guess it's \"suck it up buttercup\" time!!! Would like to keep in touch with you to compare experience. PM if that works for you. Either way, I wish you the best moving forward. 😊",

My theory is the infection has been there all along and it's finally coming to the surface. Sure seems to me that cancer doctors are quick to push us all into this defined box of treatments and how we're supposed to respond. When we don't fit in their box, they dismiss the complaint. Sometimes it works out.... Sometimes, not so much. I'm thankful for the cancer doctors but wish they could be more human and actually LISTEN to their patients. grrrrrr!!!!!!",

Sure sounds like some of your issues could, and should have been prevented. Based on the data from our little group, your reaction, and mine, are not the \"norm\" but clearly the issue occurs. Was it meanmom who also had infection? If the medical community would stop being so full of themselves and just LISTEN to their patients, perhaps issues like ours could be avoided. I warned the BS about my history of suture rejection, he was the typical ass, poo poo'd the possibility. He should have listened. I'm the one paying the price, he's simply annoyed. Sorry for the rant ladies. I've lost my sense of humor and it's hard to stay positive. Jean, thanks for the chuckle. I think mqt64 and I got the bottom of the class. Guess someone had to pick them.",

FYI, I did not ask for anything but responded honestly when asked. So it's all in my head? Is the RO just being dismissive?

Yikes1, you're right, it's stated as pure but there are some other chemicals in there. I'm not aware of any without because the plant extract needs preservatives the way we use it and straight from the plant isn't practical. I've been using it and aquafor , twice a day (min) and it doesn't seem to cause problems. It's cooling. I'm still pink and feeling like a fireball under my skin. So not sure if my plan is working or not. I also use the Spand-Gel pads. They are a hydrogel sheet specifically for radiation burns. They really pull down the burning but difficult to use unless you're at home. I take 2-4 Advil 4-6 hours. Doesn't stop the pain, maybe less, easier to function.",

I felt so depressed and apprehensive. They tried 5 times to do my IV before they got it. My arm is a mess! Then while they were doing the final safety check, computers went down. I was in preop for 2 1/2 hours and had a strong urge to bolt! Seriously considered it! Finally got to surgery and it went ok, lump is out! Pathology will be ready next week so I'm in the sadly familiar waiting stage. Surgeon would not give me much info., said we'd talk when we meet next week. Pretty sore and tired but I feel improvement in the pain. Boob is pretty swollen but stitches seem to be holding so far. Coyote, I followed up on the advocate and talked to one on Monday. She \"promised\" to look into things and get back to me today. I'm trying to stay positive about it. I should have the results on Tuesday.",

Each of them discuss how things are going and each of the have me expose my breast so they can examine. For extra fun, sometimes they take pics of my boobs. That's gotta be a fun photo album! Nothing about this is dignified. For the most part, they try to be sensitive to the vulnerability but in the end, it IS a very vulnerable situation and I have no control.

To answer your question; make a list of questions because it can be overwhelming. Take someone with you if possible. I researched about the SEs, methods etc and asked direct questions relating to temporary issues (skin, pain, etc) and to long-term or permanent issues like lung and heart damage. You can see from our board that some ROs are open, honest and good partners, sadly others are not. It's your body, feel empowered to push back. Use what works for you for skin care, you know your body. How many treatments? Boosts? What time for the appointments? How can you reach help after hours? Contact numbers? What if you can't come in? You'll become familiar with the drill pretty quickly. Good luck my sister, I hope you have little/no SEs! Speed through, you'll be done before you know it.",

The seroma \"let go\" and kept up at an alarming rate, finally slowed down about 7 am. It was crazy, disturbing and painful! My poor boob was very swollen, not quite as bad now. (Hey, silver lining!) My surgeon is off so I ended up with a PA. She didn't feel this was an infection but due to the large seroma. While she was digging around, she found more sutures that the surgeon missed. Have to \"repack\" the open incision every day for 2-3 weeks. I can't seem to catch a break. Nearly 9 months of this crap.",

Whew, you think, I finally made it to the end of a long and painful process! Ending treatment is definitely a reason to celebrate and you probably can hardly wait to return to life as \"normal.\" But you may quickly find out that life as you knew it before treatment just isn't the same. Gone is the safety net of a team of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other means of support that are no longer there for you on a daily or weekly basis. Family, friends, and employers may have high expectations that you will be the same person you were before treatment. You will probably have the same high expectations of yourself. However, cancer is a life-altering experience and you will most likely be faced with establishing a new \"normal\" as a breast cancer survivor. A myriad of things may present themselves at the end of treatment and it's quite typical to go through an adjustment period. Experts estimate that it takes as long for you to rebound from treatment as it did for you to go through treatment*. However, we are each different and it may take weeks, months, or even years to make the adjustment. It's often said that cancer treatment is one of the few treatments that leaves you in a worse condition than you were before you started. This is often true for most breast cancer survivors. Some of the feelings and side effects you may experience at the conclusion of treatment may include: fatigue, anger, loneliness, depression, anxiety, grief, pain, permanent scars, body image adjustments, lymphedema, neuropathy, menopause, weight gain, changes in cognitive functioning (\"chemo brain\"), changes in intimacy, increased stress, fears of recurrence, along with other feelings and side effects related to your particular treatment. But there are also positive things that can happen at the end of treatment. You may appreciate life more, become more spiritual, change how you think about life, reduce your stress at work and at home, adopt healthier eating and sleeping habits, and you may even decide to channel your energy into becoming a breast cancer advocate or become a source of support to others who have been just diagnosed or are undergoing treatment. The biggest thing you need to give yourself is adequate time to heal and adjust. Be reasonable with yourself. Don't set your expectations so high that you can't reach your goals. Consult with your doctor(s) about side effects that are still lingering. Join a support group. Share with your friends, family, and employer that you are going through a period of adjustment and ask them to allow you the time to adapt. Rest, relax, and know that eventually you will come to terms with accepting the things you can't change as a result of treatment. Time is your best friend after finishing treatment. Best of luck to you as you find your new \"normal\"! ",

I lost it, cried and then explained that the doctor was dismissive and questioned the pain I mentioned. I told the nurse it cracked me to the core and I was upset still. Happy to report she seemed genuinely concerned and reassured me the pain was typical and valid. I felt better but could not stop crying. Took another hour after my drive home to finally pull myself together. I'm feeling like a drama queen! I'm not sleeping, hurting, stressed, tired (mentally and physically). Thinking we all need a nice, long vacation on a warm sunny beach, with boat drinks!!!",

It brought back many horrible memories of our initial journeys. Hearing them talk about tumors and cancer and procedures, being poked and mauled .... This time I knew what they were saying and I was scared, sad and angry... To my core! As we've all done before, now comes the waiting for test results, waiting for next procedures waiting to see what will happen to me. Remember that awful part. The 9th will be here, I'll do the surgery and hope for a clean biopsy. Then hopefully no more infection or pain. Maybe July will begin a better path. Thank you all for your support and love. I need it so very much right now. My inner strength is less then it needs to be. Your support helps more then you know.",

Every day I have pain from the breast and my abdomen. I feel nausea, dizziness and fatigue. My MO has been on personal leave for 5 months now so no help there. BS is focused on the boob, cutting out the mass. I told him I am feeling sick and he literally patted my hand and said we need to get you better. I called my MOs office today, they suggested I see a pcp because \"they only handle cancer.\" I've never met my pcp (I have Kaiser Permanente). HMO circle of hell. Am I causing sick feelings because of stress? I find myself quietly crying myself to sleep, crying in the shower and whenever I'm alone. No one to talk to because I try to keep my hysteria from hubby and friends. Doctors tend to be dismissive and judgmental so I'm hesitant to reach out. I'm feeling really lost and hopeless. I've tried so hard to not go \"there\" but, no luck. I hoped trying to ignore and repress the fear and physical feelings would get me through but...",

Yesterday was a bad day. They found a lump in the other breast and the surgery from two weeks ago on my left breast is not doing well; swelling, hot/red and seroma... painful. I'm trying really hard to stay positive and strong. Feeling such despair. How much more? I want to get in bed, never leave. So I'm in the process once again. I have to get the ultrasound then depending on outcome, biopsy and so on. Face the WAITING again. I don't know where to find the strength to face more poking, prodding and pain not to mention all the invasion into my DH and my life. My finish line keeps moving. I feel like Charlie Brown and Lucy keeps pulling the football away. I cried most of the night, staying home from work today because I can't face people and I'm finding that I break into tears randomly and without warning. I know I just need to suck it up and roll with what comes but I'm struggling to find my way to do so.",

Whew, you think, I finally made it to the end of a long and painful process! Ending treatment is definitely a reason to celebrate and you probably can hardly wait to return to life as \"normal!\" But, you may quickly find out that life as you knew it before treatment just isn't the same. Gone is the safety net of a team of doctors, nurses, technicians, and other means of support that are no longer there for you on a daily or weekly basis. Family, friends, and employers may have high expectations that you will be the same person you were before treatment. You will probably have the same high expectations of yourself. However, cancer is a life-altering experience and you will most likely be faced with establishing a new \"normal\" as a breast cancer survivor. 3A myriad of things may present themselves at the end of treatment and it's quite typical to go through an adjustment period. Experts estimate that it takes as long for you to rebound from treatment as it did for you to go through treatment. However, we are each different and it may take weeks, months, or even years to make the adjustment.

However, we are each different and it may take weeks, months, or even years to make the treatment. But there are also positive things that can happen at the end of treatment. You may appreciate life more, become more spiritual, change how you think about life, reduce your stress at work and at home, adopt healthier eating and sleeping habits, and you may even decide to channel your energy into becoming a breast cancer advocate or become a source of support to others who have been just diagnosed or are undergoing treatment. The biggest thing you need to give yourself is adequate time to heal and adjust. Be reasonable with your expectations and be kind to yourself.",
