This started about a month after my annual mammo and finally I had an ultrasound and then an MRI and all is negative. I did recently have a blood test w high uric acid but the symptoms are just in the left breast. I feel a lot better having the tests but still wonder about the ongoing syptoms. Any idea what could be causing it?",
