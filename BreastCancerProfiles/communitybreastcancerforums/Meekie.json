I also saw, in the same breast, a difference between last years mammogram and yesterday's mammogram. There was a brighter white scattering veins more so than last year. I have very fatty breasts so the bright white streaks were easily seen. I wonder if it could be from when my autistic son punched me moderately in that same breast. Would lymph nods swell up because of trauma or only if there's an infection or cancer. Love and peace x",

      "Content": "Meekie wrote: Hi all, about a month ago a felt tender area in my left breast. I thought it might be where the end of my bra underwire was rubbing or slightly digging in. I felt the area and felt the right breast in the corresponding area but both breasts feel lumpy to me. There's no tenderness in the right breast. I wore a lose non underwire bra for a few weeks but the tenderness remained. I made an appointment for a mammogram which I had today. I'm 46 3/4 and I've had annual mammograms for the past 5 years. After the mammogram I glanced over at the screen and asked the radiographer if those were my breasts. She said yes. I saw a pea sized circular mass in my left breast exactly where the tenderness is. I asked her what is that! She said I don't know I just take the images, the radiologist analyses the images. I said ok but that mass is not in last years mammogram. She said no it's not but don't worry. Arhhh I haven't slept and it's 5am in the morning. And it's the weekend now, so won't hear anything, or can't contact them, until Monday now. I actually feel nauseous with worry. And I noticed huge oval masses in the left hand image too. I asked her what all those were. She said your lymph nodes! I couldn't see any huge lymph nodes in the right hand image. I'm worried because it's 3 things......tenderness in area where a mass showed up in the mammogram and that same breasts lymph nodes where huge. I'm extremely worried and have convinced myself it's breast cancer. Any advice from you lovely ladies would be warmly received. Love and peace x Log in to post a reply",
