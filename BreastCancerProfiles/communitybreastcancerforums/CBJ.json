ALso, can another form of BC develop in the breast cancer muscle wall and surrounding area?  I had a simply masectomy.  Also, what kind of follow up care are you receiving?  Also, even though my lymp nodes were clear, is there a chance of mets?  Thanks so much.

I just want to know what other Paget's patients think.   Hannabanana - Hey girl!  Glad to see you back on line and I do hope your recovery is going well.  Have you got your paths report back yet.  Keeping you in my thoughts.
