I am 31 and recently diagnosed with IDC 1.3 cm (50% DCIS) with 95% hormone positive ER and PR both. I am HER2 neg and my nodes were negative also. The doctor said it is stage 1a. I had a bilateral mastectomy about 3 weeks ago and my oncotype score is 16. I am married without children, but we would love a family one day. I plan on taking tamoxifen but not sure about chemo. Any suggestions? Thank you",
