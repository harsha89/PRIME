After the ultrasound the radiologist wanted to immediately do a biopsy as he felt it was probably cancer. I refused as my head was spinning and felt I needed to slow things down. So, it can be done in one day. However, without the results of the biopsy, there is really no info to give you yet. I hope you get good news on Thursday! Good luck!!",

A good friend of mine was dx at 28, triple negative, and gave birth at 31. She did not do embryo preservation as she had an 18 month old when dx. Does insurance cover any of the costs? I would think that if they covered fertility treatments then preventative treatments should also be covered. Reproductive rights for women are not at the top of anyone's list of priorities however. Please don't ever worry about sounding vain. Our appearance is a big part of who we are and it truly sucks when our control over it is taken away. I am sure, however, that when you are walking down the aisle your fiance is only going to see the beautiful person that he fell in love with. Prayers to you, along with a big hug.",

Many people on this forum use various methods to help with the anxiety such as medication (ativan and xanax are mentioned), exercise, yoga and meditation. I hope the next few days go quickly for you. Good luck!",

The beginning is the roughest and things will improve. :) For what it's worth, I loved my doctors as well, and they came highly recommended. I did not feel I needed a second opinion and I did not want to delay the recommended treatment as it was pretty cut and dry. I know the anxiety can be crippling and many have found relief with anti- anxiety meds such as ativan. Good luck!!",
