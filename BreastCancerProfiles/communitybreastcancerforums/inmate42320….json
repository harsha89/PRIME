I should also say that I have a few friends that have gone to Fred Hutch and received top-notch care.  It really does boil down to your comfort level.  Check them both out. Gilda's club is great!  Spring Carnival was so much fun last year I can't wait to go again!  Good luck on the move and welcome to Seattle.  As a native I am biased, but hey, I think it is the best place on earth to live! ",
