You can see my info in the signature line, but the consensus from 4 oncologists was to go ahead with chemo based on my tumor size and age at diagnosis (47). The younger you are at diagnosis the more they lean toward chemo. The pathology will give you more information, especially with a highly differentiated tumor. I will say that chemo was doable and they really try to minimize the side effects, of course your experience will depend on the chemo regimen. You are correct that there may not be much of a reduction in recurrence risk at your stage/grade, but you should really push your doctors on this. My MO really pushed chemo whereas my SO thought there was no evidence it would really reduce recurrence at the expense of side effect. I also cold capped to save my hair if that is a concern for you. It really worked. Good luck",

I can't tell you how many people have asked me why I haven't lost weight on chemo! When I tell them that the TC regime usually results in some weight gain, they look at me like I must be secretly eating 5 hit fudge sundaes a day, otherwise why wouldn't I be skin and bones on chemo. I just remind myself that we are deeply immersed in BC world now and until 6 months ago I would have been as equally ignorant. It helps a bit. Sometimes I think people are even more skeptical of me because I am cold capping and still have my hair and am trying to maintain a normal routine no matter how awful I feel. I recall someone on one of the boards saying that when someone says \"you look great\" just say thank you and don't tell them it took three hours to get dressed and out of the house and that you still feel that you look like cr*p. unfortunately, no one but your nearest and dearest want to hear the truth and even they sometimes want us to lie and say we feel fine.

I keep telling myself that the studies say 2-5 glasses a week, but I keep having more, rationalizing that I didn't drink at all January - July. I know that doesn't make up for it but I feel that every study says everything causes cancer and the studies on wine's effect on recurrence risk is even less clear. Part of me know no wine is my new normal and the other part of me says I tired of being told what my new normal is and just want my old life back. I was already eating very healthy before diagnosis, but was definitely having more than 4 oz of meat a week - I miss meat too! Luckily I love veggies and fish, but it does get a little repetitive.

He did great in surgery and should be back on the field in 4 weeks. I'm a week into my two week Tamoxifen vacation and no let up in foot or joint pain. The higher dose of diarrhetic makes me feel like I am parched all the time and I haven't seen much of a reduction in swollen feet and hands. This leads me to conclude that my SE are leftover from chemo and/or from the monthly Zoladex. Tamoxifen has a 14 day half life, so maybe I'll see some changes in the next week. I'm 11 weeks PFC and still get what feels,like waves of chemo bubbling up. Not a hot flash, but a very chemically feeling rush and I get dizzy and warm. Anyone else still getting this??",

My son is an athlete who will be playing football next year in college, so he needed a surgical repair. We had two urology surgical specialist look at the ultrasound and conduct physical exams to diagnose the hernia. Guess what? Today after they put him under and inserted a camera laparoscopically -- there was no hernia!! They think it may be a groin muscle strain. Hmm, don't we think they could have determined that before they put him under and cut him open? Of course I've more than met my deductible, but if I had to pay out of pocket I'd be pissed. Wondering what Blue Shield will do about unnecessary surgery. Here's a healthy and happy 2016!!   ",

I've been packing it with gauze 3 times a day and my PS thinks it will resolve, but my patience with post surgical complications is kind of at its end. And then today I went to see my endocrinologist for my regular 6 month check up for Hashimotos and she pulls up my baseline DEXA scan results from 2/27/16 that my MO had ordered. Since these were done the week before my surgery, I really sort of forgot about it and figured I would have heard from my MO if something was wrong. Well, apparently my T-score for my lumbar spine is -2.7 which means osteoporosis. She was shocked my MO had not called me. She suspects the 15 months of Zoladex caused the bone loss. I'm 49 and no family history of osteoporosis. Has anyone else been diagnosed with osteoporosis after BC treatment? Is anyone on bisphosphonates or Prolia.

Don't drive yourself crazy trying to figure out the exact cost because you'll never get a straight answer. You can ask for the billing codes for the procedure and then check with the hospital billing department. Two words of advice, always ask for a discount from the PS (mine just gave my $500 off on a non-insured portion of my surgery that I added on), ask for a payment plan and if it is an option for you, ask for a discount if you pay within the first 30 days of billing. My son had surgery on 12/28 and when the hospital billing called I asked about a payment plan and said yes, but then without me asking offered a 25% discount on the $1500 due if I paid right there on the phone by credit card. There are lots of options they don't tell you about until you start digging around!! Good luck! When you are ready I'd be happy to share what I've learned on reconstruction options for myself and from my friends (far too many) who have been down this road. Dizz - is it just me or do you feel like you may be actually putting this all behind you after having surgery last week?

I also hear conflicting information on alcohol intake regarding risk of recurrence versus risk of new primary if you've already been diagnosed with breast cancer. It seems the most recent studies focus on post menopausal woman and assume tamoxifan. I met with a integrative oncologist yesterday (different from my regular MO) who said alcohol is carcinegenic and should be avoided by breast cancer survivors except for limited social occassions for not only risk of new or recurrent breast cancers, but other cancers (since we are now at higher risk). On the red meat front, generally I see 4 oz. one time a week and to aim for plant based diet. I'm fine with the red meat limits, although I'll have to resume my role as a short order cook as DH and DSons will want red meat more than one time a week! Same question on fat intake. 20 grams/day max? I know the safe answer is to avoid red meat, alcohol and fat, but I also am conflicted with do I really need to change my entire diet so drastically and avoid wine when we are also bombarded with the message that they really don't know why we all got BC! Was it the wine, the birth control pills, the fact that my mother took DES or just the fact that I'm a woman with dense breast tissue. I still think it was the Diet Cokes!

Not sure how much I can about the nipple at this stage, but I'm going to be under anyway for the oophorectomy. Considering treating myself to a little chin lipo during the surgery. Age, estrogen suppression and tamoxifen seem to have left me with a few new chins! It is $3500 to add on the cosmetic procedure, so I probably won't do it, although I keep thinking I deserve some good surgery out of all this! Has anyone else had an oophorectomy or thinking about it? I'm curious about recovery time.",

I already had an appointment scheduled for a 6 month check up next week, so I decided to hold my breath a wait. So two days later I wake up and guess what? The hard lump has morphed into a giant zit! Likely due to our hot weather and sunscreen! The worry never ends! Still have a fairly large open wound from my March 3rd stage 2 reconstruction that I have to pack with gauze 3 times a day.

It would just be me and my 15 year old driving as my husband and 17 year old are back east for college tours (actually heading to Maine tonight!). I'd be staying with friends and other families up there. The lake feeds my soul so I think it would be very good but concerned about drive and the lack of a major hospital. There is a regional hospital which is nice and unfortunately we have experience at from skiing injuries! I ended up in ER 2 weeks ago with fever, but WBC was fine and I was sent home. Feeling cabin fever here at home as not working and have not left town since February! Had 3rd TC on 6/18 and last one 7/9. Feel ok right now but have not really done much this week except for errands and walks. Guess I'm looking for someone to tell me it's ok to go (or tell me on their experience it's a really, really bad idea)! My girlfriends say they'll take better care if me up there than me being by myself at home and if need be will drive me back home to UCSF. Torn. As for alcohol - my chemo teach nurse said none. I had some elevated liver enzymes before surgery due to some post diagnosis consumption, so have not risked it during chemo as I don't want to having liver levels to cause any delay and liver is already working overtime in chemo. Tried a sip of wine last month and it tasted terrible, so it hasn't been much of an issue. The real challenge will be when chemo is done and my taste for wine comes back. The 3 glasses a week limit will be a challenge for me as we are wind and food lovers. I keep telling myself that life has changed and this will be for the best to really cut back. Had club soda, cranberry and limepoolside last night while my friends had the same just with vodka added! Actually had to have my friend check that mine did not have vodka as they all looked the same and I couldn't really taste it! I think for me it might just be the ritual of a Friday night cocktail and not the alcohol itself. Just kidding - it's the booze too! Happy Saturday! San Francisco is awash in gay pride! What an amazing weekend! People are visibly happy and celebrating. As a lawyer I plan to read the actual opinion this weekend, which will be boring and all about states rights and the constitution, but if you get a chance take a look at the last paragraph of the opinion. Not typical Supreme Court rhetoric, but beautiful!  ",

KBee - happy 20th! Ours was in November and we had a great trip to Hawaii - diagnosis one month later! Interestingly, I was on metformin for five years and stopped about 2.5 years ago. Wondering about the correlation to my tumor growth? Will talk to my endocrinologist about maybe going back on. Anyone taking Gabapentin for nerve pain and hot flashes? Just picked up the RX and the list of side effects, including depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation were a little concerning, especially to someone with a history of depression (managed now with meds and exercise). Not sure it's worth less hot flashes! I get zoladex injections and will start tamoxifen in August, so flashes are an issue, but not horrible. Little blue - good luck tomorrow! I finished last week and although still not feeling great, there is a slowly creeping in sense of relief! ",

I am 7 weeks post TC x 4, 3 weeks on Tamoxifen, and have been only monthly Zoladex injections since January. I have had joint pain since starting the Zoladex, which worsened with chemo. Now I have such bad pain in my feet in the morning that it is hard to walk. I also get it if I've been sitting for a while. The pain is in the heel and ball of foot. It goes aways after walking around for a few minutes. I also have increasing neuropathy in my legs, arms and hands and lips (of all places!). I've been on Gabapentin for 7 weeks, but the neuropathy has been pretty persistent. The new SE is that the joints at the base of my thumbs are incredibly painful and neither Advil or heat/ice give me much relief. I've been walking, doing pilates and accupuncture and taking magnesium and b vitamins. Any creative thoughts on the cause of the SE's and/or suggestions for other remedies. My MO's nurse said to try taking a break from Tam for a week and see if symptoms lesson, but I'm concerned about taking a week break. I feel like it took me about 10 days to adjust to it when I started and don't really want to go through that again! Let's just say I was extremely cranky!!",

I will start back up on tamoxifen in two weeks, but spilt the dose between morning and night. Hope this will help with SE. Hard to know what is residual taxotere SE, Zolodex or tamoxifen!",

I can't seem to get my strength back up. The pain is what I would consider bothersome now, more than actual pain. I had my DIEP flap scar revised so that is really tight and there's a little suture that has opened up on my stomach and on the breast fold too. My PS says it is okay and part of the healing, but I didn't have that the first time around. I am so ready to be back in action but every time I try to do stuff, I pay for it later. Of course, I'm fully off pain meds so that is part of the issue, but the Norco was killing my stomach! Ok, whining over. Hope everyone else is doing well! Sheila",

Best tips are lots of water before and after, stay on a schedule with Zofran even if u don't think you need it, take Claratin if you are getting Neulasta, rinse with salt water and baking soda or Biotene, and get a bit of exercise every day. Evenwalking around the block helps! You can do this!",
