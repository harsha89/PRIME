Went in today for a diagnostic mammo; the technician did her very best but couldn't get the lump area between the plates. The lump is on the upper inside of my breast; between 11:00 and 3:00. The lump was easily found on ultrasound; so now I'm back in the waiting game to hear if it's a cyst or needs biopsy. Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "morningperson wrote: Hello, I am 49, birads 3, with 8mm solid, oval mass in the right breast. Currently, I am waiting 3 months for another ultrasound, and was reviewing my family history. My paternal grandmother had breast cancer; she had two sons, no daughters. My sister is 55, so we are both really past the age where the BCRA genes matter since these genes are associated with breast cancer in younger women, but I am curious whether or not my risk has been understated since my grandmother did not have any daughters. I currently do not know how old she was when she had cancer, but I am trying to find out. Thanks in advance for any help! Log in to post a reply",
