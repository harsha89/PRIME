I forgot to take the freaking Claritin for the Nulasta and deeply regretted it. I remembered when the bone pain hit. It was like the worst flu/pain I've ever had. But I survived and won't make that mistake again!!! Slight nausea, probably more from the pain, and today had to take an Imodium for the first time in my life. Some fatigue. Basically, sounds like I'm average here. I have a good friend who is my dentist who I talked with when my mouth started getting tender. She gave me the softest toothbrush ever, some specific toothpaste/dry mouth, a rinse, some gels and some hard \"candies\" for dry mouth and sensitivity. If anyone has mouth issues, I'm happy to pass along what she told me. She disagreed with my oncologist about rinsing with a salt/soda water mixture. I cut my hair the same day as my chemo. Right now, I'm trying to figure out this hair thing. When will it fall out? How am I really going to deal with it? I've been very upbeat, proactive, open with friends, family and coworkers. But I don't know how I'm going to handle the looks. I'm feeling very anxious but don't want to talk about it with said friends and family. On the up side, I had a Christmas miracle today! I folded the laundry and every sock had a match. Every. Sock. That never happens. ",

Each day the fatigue diminishes. Unfortunately, I lost more eyelashes. I'm afraid they might all be gone soon even though my last chemo was two Fridays ago.

I can handle going out with my hats (I never tried the wig, wasn't interested). But I wear my cheater reading glasses (big round ones) to camouflage my lack of eyelashes and eyebrows. I won't say it was harder than losing the hair, but it definitely bothers me more now. Flower, I picked up a couple of baseball style hats for my weekend in Florida - https://www.headcovers.com/tenley-baseball-cap/ But I have to share the worst thing that has happened to me in all of this, and it has weighed upon me even though I swore not to let it get to me. So here's the rather long story. Went to dinner in Ft. Lauderdale with DH, son and his girlfriend to a nice restaurant with a good bar. We didn't get there until 8:30 which is late for dinner for me, and the drinking crowd was having some fun. No worries. We were in the outdoor seating area and it was getting cool so I put on my nice zip up North face light gray sweatshirt. I was wearing the hat in the above link and some long jean capris and tennis shoes. Like I've told you all before, right before the chemo I was dieting and I've lost around 100lbs. I was feeling pretty good about myself and thought I looked rather cute. Washing my hands, son's girlfriend also in the restroom with me, a drunk young woman says loudly \"I didn't know these were co-ed bathrooms. I froze momentarily as I realized she was referring to me. Then I turned around and said \"Not co-ed, chemo.\" and took my hat off looking her in the eye. She went white. Then started apologizing, then started crying and telling me how awful she felt, her family was going through some things,blah, blah, blah.\" I helped her fix her dress (so short she kept flashing us from the front, lol). and sent her on her way. I know she was drunk. But it hurt. I thought I looked cute and she mistook me for A MAN. And there I was, hairless, eyelashless, and almost eyebrow less, consoling a bitchy 20 something that used her inebriation as a weapon and her tears as a defense. I'm kind of mad that I didn't say I was transgendered and what was her problem just to make a point about bigotry, but I was too stunned to think that quickly. And now, I think about this incident every morning as I put on my makeup. Not sure how to put it behind me and usually I'm pretty pragmatic, logical and not that sensitive. There, venting complete, thanks for \"listening.\"",

Apparently some of the nails are partly separated from the nail beds. The nurses say I just need to let them grow but it kind of freaks me out. Anyone else having the same thing with fingernails? Lakes? I live minutes from Lake Huron, but grew up (mostly) in Missouri. I had no problem switching allegiance to Lake Huron from Lake of the Ozarks - no comparison. Ozarks, while nice, is brown and full of venomous snakes (my grandparents had a place on the lake). Lake Huron (where I live is called the Blue Water Area) is as blue and clear as the Caribbean on a summer day. It's gorgeous. And no venomous snakes!

I haven't lost any nails yet, but they are still very funky looking. I have one that I think is going to go, but I'm wondering if I put nail polish on where it seems to be cracking/separating if that will \"glue\" it to the healthy nail coming along below the crack until it grows out and I can trim that part off. Yesterday, I thought I saw eyelash new growth. Neuropathy in fingers nearly gone, middle toes still feel numb most of the time. Hair is coming in. Still seems thinner on the top of my head than the sides, but I'm trying not to worry about that. I walked my dog 4 miles this morning at a very fast pace - as fast as I was before all this nonsense.

It's weird; I have a macabre fascination with my side effects/symptoms. So I'm always thinking \"Do I feel this way because of chemo, or do I feel this way because I'm 51?\" Glad to hear your timeline on the hair loss. My kids (21, and 23) are coming home for Christmas and I'm afraid they're going to be right at the beginning or middle of the hair loss process. I know we're supposed to take care of ourselves first, yada, yada, yada, but I'm a mom and a wife and I worry about the impact on my family. I think it's going to be tough on them all and I want to minimize the impact, especially because it's Christmas and our time together is limited. Beznaranca - I'm doing a 12 week course, 4 chemo treatments of taxotere and cytoxan, and my first treatment lasted about 3.5 - 4 hours. If you get Nuelasta -Don't forget to take the claritin the day before the Neulasta and for 4 days after. Cherd - I have appointments weekly. This Friday was with the nurse practitioner (She's great!!!) for a blood draw and to see how I'm doing. Next Friday will be with the nurse, again, a blood draw. The next Friday with the Oncologist (I'm assuming more vampiric activity) then the next one chemo again. I agree, doing this through the Holidays stinks, but I doubt it would \"smell\" any better any other time of year. . . General random thoughts: Other things that have helped me: Walking. Last Christmas we rescued a dog. In January I started Nutrisystem because I was obese and didn't want to die (a bit of irony here). Since then, I've lost 92 lbs and walk an average of 4 miles with the dog every morning. I've tried to keep that up this last week after chemo and it actually helped, even during the bad bone pain. I only did 3 miles a couple of mornings, my pace slowed down significantly. But I did it, despite the massive headaches, the fatigue, the bone pain and the gas cramping. I always felt better about halfway through and after. So I highly recommend walking through it if you can.",

It makes all the rest of this stuff easier to handle if you can feel upbeat even a little, at least for me. Flower - ditto on the Look Good, Feel better. But the nurse I talked to called me to come into the hospital anyway for a one on one with her and the remainder of the free swag they still had to give away. I got a lot of makeup, some of which I'll use and some facial moisturizer which I'm using a lot of right now. She was nice, but the whole thing was kind of depressing. I cried when I returned to my car. The message I was hearing (not the one they intended I'm sure) is \"You're going to look awful, so let's figure out how to cover that up.\" It felt rather like trying to put lipstick on a pig. Still . . . free stuff is nice. I'm two weeks post my first chemo and hair really started to drop last night. So, I'm getting it all shaved off this afternoon. I think I'm a smart, logical, practical, non-sentimental type of person. So something as superficial and temporary as hair loss shouldn't bother me, right? But it does. I can't seem to logic my way around this grief emotion which makes absolutely no sense to me. It actually offends me that I'm upset about this, if that makes any sense. My son, who graduated in May from college and is working his \"real\" job now down in Florida (we're in Michigan) asked if I wanted him to shave his head in support of me. He even volunteered his younger sister (Junior in college) to shave her head too, without, of course actually talking with her about it first. He said \"Dad's pretty much already with you there.\" (DH is almost completely bald already.) Made me smile. I think that's taking the adage \"Misery loves company\" a bit too far. Lastly, got a book I think I'm going to love. It's Lin Manuel Miranda's \"GMorning, Gnight.\" First thing I read in the moring, and last thing I read before I go to sleep. Whimsically real, thoughtful and not too sappy. Hope you all have a great day!  ",

Noticed significant hair loss on the 19th when I would run my fingers through my (short) hair. Thursday morning shower it seemed even a bit more so I called my hairdresser and went in that afternoon to have her clip it all off. I was surprised, but she said they didn't have the ability to shave it clean, I'd need to do that at home (she was incredibly nice about the whole thing and didn't even charge me - one more score of free stuff for the cancer pity!). So I went home. A friend came by and gifted me with a homemade crocheted winter hat. Very cute. Tried to put it on and .... stuck! My bristly head was like velcro. We laughed like maniacs. Later, putting on and taking off shirts they would stick to my velcro head. Tried to use the astringent given to me in my chemo relief box, the cotton ball stuck to my head. It was annoying (funny , but annoying). So today I had DH shave my head. We used my regular razor (new blade) and my shaving cream. It was weird. Didn't hurt, though I kept expecting it to and flinching, which then scared DH. After, got in the shower and touched it up some more, mostly by feel. Still have a couple of spots we're trying to figure out how to get to, like right by my ears. I was too chicken to use Nair, but that sounds more appealing now. Good news - hats and shirts and cotton balls no longer stick to my head! What a strange, strange journey we are on . . .",

After that, I got nothing for you: wish I had a magic cure for all of this for all of us! I've had two days of work and it's going fine. I have all the energy I need for my face to face class, and when it's done - I'm wiped. But that's ok, because I can go home and from the comfort of my big chair, in my sweats with my dog cuddled up next to me I can attack my online classes (or nap). My worries about energy weren't unfounded, but I think my solution is going to work just fine. This second round, week two is going fine. Only real SE is the fatigue and mild headaches. I thought I was developing thrush, now I don't think so. When I thought I was, I brushed my teeth and extra time during the day and rinsed an extra time or two with the Biotene. My mouth routine is at morning and night 1. brush with colgate sensitive toothpaste, 2. brush with prevident 3. rinse with Biotene. So far, no sores, no thrush, no real problems except lack of taste. Starting to get a little taste back again. If it's like the first round, I should be able to taste a couple of days before the next infusion kills all taste again, lol. Hope this helps alleviate some fears for those who are a week or two behind me in the schedule. For many of us, we can manage the SEs as we gain experience. The fatigue, well, that's something we just have to manage. Fun thing, my sister in law who knitted me a bunch of hats, made a matching one for my dog! My dog absolutely hates it, but I got a cute pic of her in it.  ",

Be sure to post a pic of your favorite blinged out hat for us to admire! Angie, so sorry to welcome you to the club. I don't think anyone is ever prepared for losing the hair, even though we all knew it was highly probable. I recommend retail therapy of hat shopping - you're beautiful and will rock what ever headgear you choose, or the bald look if you choose nothing at all. Stay strong warriors!",

The thing is the stubble doesn't seem to be growing very fast, just enough to keep me at a near constant velcro effect. I razored it a week ago, and really, not much change in a week. In comparison, I cut my hubby's hair (he's bald except for a ring of hair, so I use the clippers almost as low as they can go about every 3 weeks). His hair grows perceptively a lot over the course of week. Mine doesn't feel like it has grown at all - just velcro level. Annoying. And now, I noticed a missing patch of lower eyelashes on one eye. This really has me down, worried. Kber - welcome to the club. Wish I had some advice for you but I'm on a different treatment.

Probably my own fault for playing on my computer and not just letting myself go down. I do that sometimes, don't know why. I'm not a good napper, never have been. Went straight to Ulta (makeup) from chemo. Saw another gap in my lower eyelashes, so I bought some fake ones in case I wake up one morning and find a big gap there too. Never used them, but the Ulta clerk gave me a tutorial. Wish me luck that I don't need them, or luck I can actually remember what she told me to do if I do need them! Got home, ate lunch, graded some of my online classes' assignments. Emptied the dishwasher, folded some clothes, played some on the computer. Aaaannnnd, I'm wiped out. I don't remember the fatigue hitting until a day or two after chemo. No other problems or SEs so far though. My big worry is always the Neulasta SEs since I had such a horrible 1st round with it. I'm optimistic this will be more like round 2. I'm back to major velcro head. Doesn't look or feel like any hair is actually growing except maybe microscopically. But everything sticks to my head - hats, scarves, shirts. I even tested running a sock over my head and that too stuck. I don't want to shave it again because I'm kind of curious about what it's going to do! Decent taste came back yesterday, so tonight I'm getting pizza before I lose the ability to taste again. How'd you do Flower? Nanette, word loss is the worst. Both my parents had/have dementia/alzheimer's and any type of memory deficit sends me into a panic. I'm pretty much screwed on that count genetically and don't need any help on that front! Angie - right, it is an amazing transformation - physically and emotionally. So much of our identity is expressed through our hair. When I shaved, it was like removing a part of my identity. Who am I? Who do I want to be? How do I want to be defined? My choice of wig/no wig or hat/no hat/which hat is helping refine how I see myself and who I want to be. Coupled with my massive weight loss this last year, looking at myself in the mirror brings a lot of questions and surprisingly a lot of empowerment. I thought you might be able to relate, or maybe someone else out there does. We are so much more than our appearance, we are strong, smart, loving, witty, generous, imperfect woman. Hear us Roar!",

I can almost taste the peanut butter and it actually tastes, mostly, like peanut butter. It's warm, easy texture and filling. Perfect food for the week after a treatment for me. Angie, I have the hat on/hat off bit too. Head gets cold, head gets hot. Yesterday was a bit rough. Got up, walked the dog 2 miles - I've skipped the last few days because of bitter cold. Cold wasn't bad, but I got fatigued very, very quickly. Went to work, taught- that was fine, but it exhausted me. Then the bone aches increased. My teeth hurt. I still don't understand how my teeth can ache. So I came home and napped, which I never do, I'm a horrible napper. Stomach's a little off too. This was day 4 after the Friday chemo. Seems for me, that's the magic day of yuck. Monday wasn't great, but Tuesday was worse. Good news, still wasn't as bad as that first round where I forgot to take the Claritin right away and had horrific bone pain and massive headaches. But this fatigue, whew. Just going up and down my stairs at home makes my legs feel jello like today too. More good news - we got so much ice, my college cancelled all morning classes so I don't have to go in and teach today!! WHhooohooo, it's an all day pj/sweats day for me! I've done 3/4 of my treatments now. I'm planning a trip to Ft. Lauderdale 3 weeks after the last one to see my son before I start radiation. The idea of sitting on a beach in the sun is helping me get through this, I hope you all have some happy, warm, comfortable thought to hold onto today too.

I now have one spot under the breast that is about dime size and looks/feels raw. Otherwise, doing fine. Breast is red, nipple is sore, skin is \"burned\" but not really painful and I haven't had much itching. I'm told to expect the skin to get a little worse even after the treatments are finished for a few days, then it's all good and everything should clear up relatively quickly. Nail update - unfortunately my optimism was not completely warranted. Looks like I'm losing one, probably two nails and I'm skeptical for a third now also. What really sucks is they are both of my pointer fingers. I also went to a dermatologist yesterday for a full body mole check. Figured one benefit of no hair was an ability to see everything. I'm clear - no signs of skin cancer. Dr. did actually recommend biotin for hair regrowth and latisse for lashes. Said he'd write me a script for them once he gets the ok from my MO. He said there was nothing really to do for the nails, just be patient and let it all grow out. Not what I wanted to hear, but oh well, at least I know. And I scheduled my colonoscopy. No more procrastination or excuses. I am now Proactive!!!! Also, I figured I've more than met my deductible for insurance, let's get every doctor appointment I could possibly need in the first half of the year so I can be mostly doctor visit free for the second half of the year. Anyone else getting tired of doctor offices?!!!! It's sunny and warmer here today, my mood is good, and the end of treatment is near! Nanette - hope the surgery went smoothly and recovery will be quick and easy! Angie, hope your lungs are clearing up and the treatment yesterday didn't kick your butt.

As for the hormone blocker, I'm on lexatrole. So far, no noticeable SEs. I had one afternoon where I suddenly felt incredibly sad/depressed/down and I broke down crying. It made me start thinking about all the bad things I'm still struggling with and I started cycling down into feeling even more sorry for myself and more depressed. But I had a moment of clarity and realized, I'm not really that sad, I'm not really that down because things are going well. So through the tears I looked up SEs and yes, mood swings/depression can be a SE. I realized my emotions were chemically driven, not fact based. So I rode the wave. I texted my daughter and told her what I was going through and asked that she texted me throughout the day with things that were going on in her day, just to help me stay grounded. It worked. The mood lifted within an hour and then I had lovely texts throughout the day with daughter. So if anyone else is experiencing this, I'd recommend taking emotional stock when you feel so down and make sure it's not just chemical. Knowing it was, helped me tremendously in just riding it out. Kber and Penelope, hope you're doing ok too! What a great group on this forum. I will try to post a pic of my head to show you how much further behind Mary I am. For reference, my last chemo was Feb. 8, followed by 4 weeks of radiation. But the radiation should not have affected hair growth.

Yeah, the only time I've really cried was when I went to the salon and had to say the words \"take it all off.\" I can't say what your experience will be, but for me, shaving it all off, though weird and uncomfortable in the process, made the transition easier. I'd say within about 24 hours I was better adjusting to my new, temporary, normal. If you're looking for advice, I'd say get rid of it all so you don't have to see it, feel it, worry about it anymore. I'm so thankful for you that your DH was there. Get some fun hats, some dangle earrings and be the bald, badass warrior you are! Also, in our family, when something bad happens, we give ourselves a 24 hour pity party then put our big boy, girl pants on and get back to it. Take your day to grieve or more if you need. This chemo crap is hard to deal with, you deserve to let go for a while. Hope today is better. Sending love, hugs and as much humor as I can muster!  Second chemo round notes: Doing much better so far this time. Chemo was Friday, Nuelasta Saturday. So far, no horrific bone pain, headaches, earaches, gum sensitivity. Just think I'm a bit more tired than I was last time, but I was still able to single handedly take down the Christmas decorations then clean the house of all the debris yesterday so I'm calling this a win. Today will be the big one if I remember correctly from the 1st time. So - taking extra steroids, remembering to take the Claritin and doing so a bit earlier and an extra dose or two, taking the Prilosec (for gas pains) and taking the Tylenol and Tylenol PM at night seem to be doing the trick! (All as directed by my Nurse Practitioner, so don't think I'm just winging it, lol). Tonight I'm going to a fancy party - one of those shindigs where you buy a table with other friends, there's music, dinner and drinks. I've never done anything like it. We bought the tickets before we really knew about the chemo so I'm a little nervous about going - afraid of pooping out, afraid I'll suddenly get the stupid bone pain. A little nervous about the bald thing - don't have a great hat for this outfit. But otherwise, looking forward to ringing in a new year! Wishing all of you a better year with no cancer by the end of it!",

So, I picked out a tighter hat, one that clearly shows I have no hair under it, and it was VERY brightly multi colored. It is a hat that says \"Look at me!\" I figured they were going to look anyway, let's put it all right out there and get it out of the way. Did I get looks, jaws dropping and frowns of concern? Yep. But it wasn't that bad. At one point a friend asked if I really had lost all my hair, so I whipped the hat off and showed her my bald head! We laughed. Ultimately, it was no big deal. And I liked that I at least felt like I had some control over the situation. I approached it on MY terms, no one else's. As far as second round goes, tomorrow is one week from second infusion. I had a good day yesterday, though more tired, and today, more tired and some bone pain again. A soak in a warm bath and a tylenol seem to be relieving that. Bad news, a bit of thrush starting . . . ugh. As if having all my food taste like paste wasn't bad enough. Silver lining, I've lost all the weight I put on over Christmas when I could taste for a while. At this rate, I'll make my 100 lb mark in a week or less (I was dieting all year before chemo, so don't yell at me, lol). Christine, I think you look fabulous!!!!!!! That's a really good wig - I wouldn't have known it was a wig if you hadn't said so! I talked with a friend at work today who has had cancer and chemo and whose wife now has cancer. He honestly wasn't sure which role was more difficult. I found his perspective interesting and thought provoking. Not sure it changes my behavior any, but thought I'd put it out there for what it's worth. Stay strong and you do you!",

Also have no reference for taxol. Good luck! For me this week the two most annoying issues have been 1 - my face is leaking and 2 - my fingernails hurt. My nose is running nonstop and my eyes watering nearly as much. Saw my MO this morning and asked if there was anything I could take for these; nope. It's a SE of taxotere he said. Grrr, when it's -13 outside having your nose run and tears run down your face is adding insult to injury. Plus, everyone thinks I'm upset/crying and I have to say, no, it's just my face leaking. The fingernail thing is also, apparently, a fun SE of taxotere. Could be worse, I keep telling myself, but these are such a constant, though minor, pain that it's draining. And my nose is raw! A week from tomorrow is my last chemo. I'm worried about the cumulative effect of it all making this one a real bad drag. But the upside, it's the last one. I can do this!!!!! Hope you all kept safe and warm during this Arctic blast! ",

I'm dealing, that's how I'd put it (as if any of us have a choice to deal with it or not). Flower, my last and #4 is on Friday, so I'm right behind you. I'm both looking forward to it (because it's the last one!!!!) and dreading it more than any others (because the SEs are starting to pile up). I'm not looking forward to any of the SEs getting worse or adding any new ones on this last round. Here's what I'm afraid of in no particular order: 1. Neulasta pain will be bad, because 3 was worse than 2. 2. My fingernail pain is now also my toenail pain and it's becoming a problem. I don't want to touch/do anything that means contact with my nails. My tennis shoes (very good, comfortable shoes) were hurting the toes on one foot yesterday and it didn't go away when I took them off. If it gets worse, that's a problem. 3. Loosing the rest of my eyelashes. Most of the bottom is gone and the top is getting a little thinner. I tried putting on fake ones a couple of days ago and failed miserably. Haven't tried again since. 4. Fatigue. I'm still more tired than I'm used to being. I'm almost 3 weeks out from the last chemo, but when I took the dog for a walk this morning (weather is actually ok, not subzero) 3 miles at a slow pace almost did me in. I knew it at about 2, but had no choice but to walk on home which brought it to 3. I thought I had more energy, boy was I wrong. 5. MY FACE WON'T STOP LEAKING!!! I've tried the eye drops and the nasal spray and nothing stops the watery eyes and drippy nose. The nose is actually the less annoying one now. The eyes, when they really get going, make it hard to see stuff. People look at me funny, I think they think I'm upset and crying. I AM upset but it's because I'm \"crying.\" Ugh, I really don't want to up the ounces leaking from my face, if that's even possible. Okay. I'm done ranting. On Wednesday the college where I work is doing a support cancer research women's and men's basketball games. I feel like I should go because I could be the poster child for the event. We'll see how I feel Wednesday at 5:30. Angie, she sounds amazing. If you get to meet her, post a pic for us. Everyone, like Dory in Finding Nemo says, \"Just keep swimming.\" Sometimes, that's all we can do. ",

If you're like me, the bone pain starts to hit 2 days after the nuelasta and peaks on the 4th day after. Like you, I keep telling myself, I can do this. This is the last one. So even if it's bad, it's done. But I'd be happy to send you stupid jokes if it gets bad. I do that for my kids in college when they're having a rough day or so. They tell me it helps. As for the exercise, I was doing real well up till this last round. Then the fatigue and the sub zero temps ganged up and kept me from getting out and walking. I'm hitting it again this week but am worried about this last round. I'd also be interested in how the fatigue goes for you. I hope you're zumba-ing away with no SEs interferring!!! I did more research on the Livestrong and think I will definitely give it a go. The idea of getting back some strength and endurance is VERY appealing at this point, isn't it!?! Be well all.",

I figure I won't feel worse if I get some exercise and I might feel better, so I've tried to walk at least a couple of miles every morning. Today, weather hampered us and we only got a mile an a half, but I made up for it by snow blowing the driveway. Yet another day of my college closing for weather, ugh. Fingernails hurt more though. I can't use them for anything, not even to open soda. Appetite and taste dropped out completely. Again, just trying to get through. I'm optimistic in three weeks I'll feel more like me as the last of this poisin works through my system and before I start radiation.

Now, the sides and temples have noticeable fuzz but the crown doesn't look like that hair stubble is growing. I have no idea about the back, haven't really checked. I thought I could detect a hint of stubble on my legs, but not enough to even think about shaving yet. I like how you described your nails as \"desperate.\" That pretty much sums it up. I don't think I'm going to lose any, but 5/10 nails look dead starting halfway to the tips. I've always had good nails - don't do manicures or much polish, but they are strong, grow nice, good shape, cuticles,etc. So this, along with all the other fun residual SEs kind of blows. But it, too, shall pass. Lakes, rivers, mountains, forests, plains - it's all beautiful. It's nice to just have a place to rest your eyes sometimes. Have a great day all.",

I was told to keep them short and in so many words, baby them. For example, I don't open any pop cans or do anything that requires me to use the nail. When I first started having the pain (before the nails looked anything like this) my NP said one woman kept her hands well moisturized and wrapped the nails in bandaids til it all grew out. I'm thankful they no longer hurt, but I agree, this sucks. Now I didn't have taxol, but rather taxotere but since they both start with tax I'm guessing they're related, lol. I've been watching this develop and it seems that it's a race between the nail separating from the top and the nail growing out from the bottom. Can't do anything much, but I'm choosing to be optimistic. I've attached a pic of the nails here so you can tell if this is what you're experiencing. It's not gross, but it's not attractive either. Sorry the pics are soo HUGE. I can't figure out how to shrink them down lol, so I've given up. My toes don't seem to be doing this, but they started hurting a week or two (or maybe more I don't remember) after the fingers started hurting. They don't feel loose or tender. There's just a tad bit of what I'd describe as numbness at the tips of a few fingers. But they don't look pretty. I've also read to avoid nail polish with a couple of exceptions, so I'm just ruling out any nail treatments for the time being. Taxotere - the gift that keeps on giving!  ",

Then the IV continued to hurt so I couldn't do any work because I couldn't even use my right hand to manipulate the mouse. No big deal I thought, the benadryl will hit and I'll have a nice nap. Nope, it was as if there was no bendadryl - no effect this time though the last three knocked. me. out.

Still, not how I wanted it to end, but glad I don't have to do it again! Neulasta goes off in a couple of hours. I'm dreading the bone pain which I anticipate will set it in a couple of days. I'm dreading the fatigue which seems to already be setting in today. That is not a good sign. But maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised and none of that will occur. . . . yeah, right. Tired, but no SEs except constipation. Yes, I'm taking the stuff, no results for 3 days. Ugh. The small indignities we have to deal with along with the larger ones of losing hair, eyelashes, feeling like hell. Angie, I thought the hoops looked too Pirate like for me (at least large ones). My medium to small ones are ok, but I don't feel like they take up enough space, if you know what I mean. So for Christmas, I got two sets of earrings: a silver and a gold dangle that my daughter picked out. (I don't let DH pick out jewlery, he has weird/poor taste, lol.) They are teardrop or medallion shaped. Not too decorative. Here's a quick pic of the silver ones. (Don't judge me, I'm at home in my comfy clothes and hat trying to get motivated to grade a whole bunch of assignments.)  Ultimately, I think you have to go with a you're comfortable with and that reflects your personality. I didn't wear big hoops before or feathers, but I will wear these even when my hair grows back. I like them. They're just a little longer/bigger than my normal. That's just one perspective. But when you try some out, send pics!",

I'm waiting because I'm going to go see my son in Ft. Lauderdale the first week of March and told them I wanted a bit of a break. They were fine with that. But they also told me we could have started sooner, so I'm not sure about the \"normal\" timeline. Tomorrow I get blood drawn. Kind of nervous about how low my counts are going to be based on how I'm feeling. I'm planning on visiting my daughter at college this weekend and am a bit concerned with my fatigue and possible really low counts.

Kber, it's like adding insult to injury when you have to fight the insurance company! Anxious, I hope you enjoy a well deserved vacation! I'm here to give you the light at the end of the tunnel bit. I'm half done with my radiation - two more weeks. Then I will just be taking an estrogen blocker pill daily. No more treatments! Bad news: I'm 6 weeks post chemo and still feeling some side effects. While fingers and toes don't hurt, they still feel funky and my nails look kind of yucky. I'm still tired and weak. Not as tired and weak, but surprisingly still feeling it. I've been walking daily, up to close to 4 miles a day - but my legs feel like jello all day after my walks and they're sore! Like if you haven't been skiing for a year and spend a day on the slopes kind of sore all the time. I probably need to ask someone about it. . . Good news; Although tire and weak, I don't feel \"bad.\" I didn't realize how constantly just bad I was feeling until it was gone. I'm happier, peppier in mood (don't have the energy to back it up for long) and generally feel like me until I try to do something that takes stamina. My eyes don't water at all, at least no more than normal. That is a huge relief. And I'm starting to see little bit of hair growth on my head. No eyelash growth and my eyebrows are pretty sparse, but some hope on my head. All taste is normal now too. So you all can do this. You will reach the end of your treatments then start to feel better. It's a lot slower than I hoped, wanted or anticipated, but slow improvement is better than feeling like crap all the time. Last observation. I've been measuring time/life in cancer increments - how many weeks to surgery, how many weeks to chemo, how many weeks between chemo, how many weeks of radiation. This is how I've planned for what feels like almost a year now (closer to 9 months but feels like a lifetime). In two weeks, I'll have to find a new metric to measure life as I'll be done with the cancer metric. I'm looking forward to that very much. You all will get there too. Hang in there, cry, laugh, break a few plates, whatever it takes. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.",

I found a thread here on radiation starting in March of 2019 which I've also found to be helpful if anyone else is there yet. Radiation is a cakewalk compared to chemo. But the fatigue is different. With chemo, it cycled and I knew it would go away a bit after a few days. This is a gentle downward slide towards, I'm not sure what it's towards - maybe becoming a bowl of jello on my couch? Everyday I feel a bit more tired, less strong, less stamina. It's frustrating because I had just started to feel \"right\" again. Bright side - only 7 more treatments to go counting today. By next Friday I'll be \"ringing the bell.\" (I don't think my dr office has a bell, but if not, I'll be ringing it in my head.) I posted part of this on the other thread, but wanted to share it here too. So I feel as though I'm getting off fairly easy. It's all relative isn't it? I feel like I got off easy because I didn't have a mastectomy, just a lumpectomy. I got off easy because my chemo was ONLY a 4 course over three months. And now I'm getting off easy because I only have to have 20 sessions of radiation. Compared to many of my warrior cancer sisters, I have a cake walk. But to those who haven't traveled this road, I'm a badass, lol. Anyone else having these type of thoughts? Perspective is an interesting thing. Wishing you all joy, strenght and ultimately, good health. Stay strong warrior sisters! ",

Had one of the few eyebrow hairs I have left give up this morning so apparently, two months post chemo, I'm still not done with the fun hair loss. I've heard about the falling out again too, but what I read is that when you stop using, your lashes revert to their \"normal\" state. Chemo isn't our \"normal' state so what I read was it \"may\" help our lashes come in a bit quicker and thicker, but if you stop using it, you may see some loss as they revert to whatever they were before chemo. The latisse studies have been done on eyelash problems for other reasons, but apparently haven't been done in relation to loss of lashes due specifically to chemo. But the literature said it had \"positive\" possibilities in this area. So what I took away from it all, won't hurt, might help, no guarantees of anything. I'm seeing more and more fuzz, thicker on the sides still than the top which is worrying. I absolutely hate the way it looks even more than I hated being bald. But here's to hoping it fills in ok.

But here goes. Christmas Eve dinner. After we go to a Christmas Eve service, we come home, just hubby and son and daughter, and we have a fondue dinner. Fancy cheese dip, and oil with lots of things to dip, several sauces, some tempura for some of them and of course, wine. It's an active meal, it takes a long time, we talk, we laugh and there are no phones or tablets anywhere in sight. Then we retire, fed in the body and in the heart. That's what I'm going to focus on today. Hope you all have a good day too.",

She told me the baking soda/salt mixture is too harsh and abrasive for our teeth. During chemo, she recomends the following products: G U M toothbrush - it's the softest toothbrush I've ever used! Colgate PreviDent 5000 - it says it's for dry mouth but she says you can use it like toothpaste during chemo. You might need to get this from your dentist, not sure it it's sold over the counter. Colgate sensitive toothpaste - I'm using both this and the PreviDent. My sensitive gums (felt like they were being torn up when I brushed) went away within 2 days really after I started this. Biotene dry mouth rinse - for after brushing or whenever I've been using all of the above. She also gave me some biotene oral balance dry mouth moisturizing gel. I wasn't a fan of this so am not using it. But she said some of her patients going through chemo found this soothing. Finally she gave me these hard candy like things, ACT dry mouth. Haven't tried them yet. I would highly recommend calling your own dentist and just saying 'Hey, I'm starting chemo and am concerned about mouth sores, teeth issues and anything else that might occur. What should I be doing? \" and see what they say. I'm finding places like to give us free stuff because they feel sorry for us, so, honestly, I'm taking advantage of that. I kinda feel sorry for me too, lol. My gums/mouth didn't start to feel sensitive/sore until a few days after chemo. But I wonder if that could've been averted had I had this stuff from the start. I've attached a picture of the stuff in case that helps. Final advice - if you're getting the Neulasta shot -TAKE YOUR CLARITIN starting the same day as chemo! That has to do with possible bone pain, not mouth issues. You've got this, you're going to be fine. We'll be thinking about you tomorrow. Eat your favorite foods today and enjoy the day! ",

I was in the process of losing tons (almost literally, I was down 95 lbs last week!) to get healthy for all these reasons and was loving it. The percentage reduction was between 7 and 9%. That was enough for me. I have three months of yuck, lost my hair, but if it means my odds improve even just 7%, for me, it was worth it. I see the SEs, even the bad ones, as temporary. I can endure. My reasons, my treatment, my score make this an incredibly personalized decision. I do not believe it is a one size fits all, even for someone with the exact same diagnosis and score as I had. I'd recomend, reading, talking with DR, talking with family and friends. But ultimately it is you that bears this burden. Make a decision and then go with it. Hope this helps. B74 - I think MCBaker nailed it. I will say, on your first follow up with the nurse practitioner, take something to write on! I had DH go with and we BOTH forgot our pads and pens. She changed some of the med amounts to combat SE and we both thought we remembered what she said - turns out we both remembered differently, lol. I ended up with some serious bone pain, gastric pain (turns out it was probably gas, taking my omeprozole solved it pretty quickly once my nurse clued me in), headaches and I survived. I felt like shit (pardon the language, but that was how it was) as if I had the worst flu of my entire life. And even so, I taught 2 full days feeling like that. I survived. I know if it is as bad this time, I'll survive. It gets better. For the majority of my three weeks after my first chemo, I felt normal, though I was constantly questioning what \"normal\" meant. DH would ask \"You doing ok? You tired?\" I'd answer \"Yeah, I think so, but I am pretty tired. . . are you tired?\" DH: \"Yeah, I'm very tired.\" Me: \"Perhaps me being tired is just normal? I did get up at 6 am, walk the dog, clean, bake, play games with kids . . . yeah, I think I'm just tired.\" It's a game we call - Is this normal or is this chemo? Hope this helps too.

This is the worst I've felt from the chemo itself (not the neulasta). I'm still extremely fatigued - I haven't started the upward trend yet. It's not debilitating, but it could be if I let myself give in to it. And the taste thing - way worse. It's not just that I can't taste anything this time, it's that a lot of things taste bad. I'm having mild stomach issues too - not throwing up, fortunately, but the nausea is more pronounced this time. It was never really an issue before. So advice for those of you approaching your fourth and final treatment - from my perspective for whatever that's worth - gear up for a bad week or two. If you haven't needed help yet, line some up. Don't make social plans (I did, and it was a big mistake). And stock up on soups, especially broth types like chicken noodle. That's been the easiest, most comforting of all the uncomfortable foods I'm forcing myself to eat. I honestly thought I could gut it through this week and all would begin to be golden by today - WRONG! Don't fear it - it will change nothing, and I am gutting it through- but be ready for it . And I will continue to gut it out next week and the week after, what choice do we have. And I KNOW that this will pass. But good golly, miss Molly, I wish it were just a little easier.",

I can't add to that discussion because I'm not doing that treatment, but you all have my sympathy. I know you can do it, but I wish it were easier on you all. I'm a little over two weeks from last chemo. Seemed to have plateaued this week with no change for the better yet really. Still rather tired - though I'm wondering if the depressing weather isn't playing a role in that. Won't walk the dog when the temp is below 20 and windchills are single digits or negatives! Taste hasn't yet returned much and I'm still dealing with fingernail/toenail pain. The constantly watering eyes are really annoying and interfere with a lot. I have to remind myself it's ONLY been 2 weeks. I leave for Florida for a few days on Thursday. Hoping the change of scenery and weather will amp up the decreasing of SEs! I bought a couple of summer weight hats for the trip. One of them I can't figure out how to wear properly, lol. I start radiation a few days after I get back. Only four weeks of that (20 sessions). What a journey we are all on, but I'm thankful for this board and for all of you who are helping me, and each other through it.  ",

Nanette - love the hair - you're the envy of just about everyone on here I imagine. Angie - that sucks. No sauna and no golf. People will say \"It's only 2.5 months you can do that easy.\" And they're right, but screw them. It's not easy, it sucks. Let's take away their favorite things, add in \"fun\" SEs and see how easy it is. Simply, sucks. But . . . you can do it, it is only 2.5 months, you will get better, be stronger and have a resilience others will envy. I am just so sorry you have to endure this new indignity. Oh how I hate cancer!!!!!!! I'm also looking into yoga. Went snorkeling while on vacation this weekend and loved it, but it WORE. ME. OUT. And I'm 3 weeks post last chemo. I need to start to regain my strength and flexibility - so, yoga! I think I'm going to make DH do it with me. The Florida sunshine did do wonders for my mood - right up until I came back home to snow and 9* temps this morning, lol. I have this week off, then start radiation on Monday. 20 sessions, four weeks then I'm done with it all but the estrogen blocker drug. Stay strong sisters, we're all a lot further along and nearer the end of treatments than when we first started posting in December.",

      "Content": "Mar 31, 2019 09:29PM - edited Mar 31, 2019 09:31PM by BeckyJL I'm generally a skeptic when it comes to this kind of stuff, so I did a little research. From what I read, there aren't really any studies proving it helps, but it might. There are relatively little risks associated with taking it, so I might even try it. But I did read this in one article: \"However, hair, skin, and nails supplements do come with one warning: Even in small amounts, they can sometimes totally screw with your lab test results. This is especially true if you're testing for issues with your thyroid or hormone levels, cardiac troponin levels (used to diagnose heart attacks), or vitamin D levels. This could lead to bogus results and misdiagnosis, which could potentially be dangerous. \"The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) further warns that the biotin effect on the monitoring of cardiac troponin has resulted in at least one death due to a falsely reported low results,\" says Michelle Galant, M.D., dermatologist at Stanford Health Care.\" With all the blood tests we're going through or are finishing up and may yet face ahead, this is something we might want to keep in mind and discuss with our doctors. I see my RO on Monday and will be asking him about this. But I eat a Spinach and goat cheese salad almost daily, lol. And apparently spinach is food which contains biotin. So, anxious, I'm six weeks post chemo and am eating salads.",

Kber - my nails are fugly too but they tell me I won't lose them. The dermatologist had a different opinion. He thinks I'll lose at least one of them, if not the three worst ones. Anxious, my leaky eyes started to dry up right around the 4 week post chemo mark. I'm 8 weeks since last chemo and have had dry eyes for several weeks now, hallelujah! The very sore legs started to diminish the last couple of weeks. That was weird and unanticipated. I haven't heard of anyone else with that other than you and me. Stamina is slow to return, but I've been doing radiation which can zap your strength too. But Friday, I rang the bell! I'm all done with treatments!!!!! Congrats Lillian for the same. Feels good. Except I peeled horrifically under my breast. Went from very little tan to full on burn and blister/peel within the space of three days on the last week of treatment. Now the armpit is starting to peel too. I'm very uncomfortable, but I'm done! Hubby brought me flowers and I brought the staff donuts. It was a great moment. And yes, Angie, I rang the shit out of that bell! ",

I started walking again - shorter distances at first of course because I had no stamina at all. After the first day my legs were sore similar to when we would go out skiing after a year off. You hit the slopes all day then sit down for dinner and can't hardly walk because your muscles are so sore. Then I'd walk the next day, and the next and it didn't seem to dissipate for weeks like I expected it to. I mean, pre- chemo if I started a new work out and then continued I'd have sore muscles for a few days then they'd be gone; it just didn't get better for almost a month. Happy to say now, while the muscles still tire and I'm still dealing with radiation fatigue, that extreme soreness is gone. I hope you're discussing this with your docs! When I did, they basically said, give it time. I hate/hated that answer. Kber - Yaaassss! Just knowing you're going I bet will help you get through!!!!! You can look forward to seeing your son, celebrating a major milestone for him and you, and sunshine and warmer weather than Jersey (hopefully) ! I'm so happy for you! As for me, the radiation burn/peel has gotten worse, but I know this is a very short term problem. The last two mornings I walked 4 miles (bra less, lol because it irritated too much). It wiped me out yesterday, but I feel a bit better today. I think I'm pushing my limits here, but I'm sick of being tired, feeling wiped out. So I decided to fake it til I make it! As for the fingernail saga, haven't lost any yet, I keep thinking they're going to go. They look awful. Fingertips (some of them) feel numb? (best description I can give of this odd feeling). I've taken to wrapping the three worst ones in a bandaid, but honestly, I only think that helps keep me from using them or catching them on anything. I'm keeping them as short as I can but it freaks me out to trim them for fear I'm going to rip them off - they are quite hard. I have fuzz on my whole head. Eyebrows still sparse as are eyelashes. Otherwise, two days post all treatment - I don't really feel any different yet. Haven't really grasped I'm done but it's starting to sink in. But everyday is just a little bit better. Hoping you can all join me in post treatment stage soon, til then, stay strong! ",

Then see what you might still need and do some online shopping with you. Basically someone to distract you. Go to a movie. Pick an event, concert, theater show you might want to see in the future and look for tickets together. Check out all the summer festivals and fairs in your area and talk/plan trips to attend some. All the chemical solutions sound fine and if they work, great, but a fall back might be distraction. Do something with someone to distract you? I'm a stranger and not close, but I'd be happy to video chat with you if you think that might be interesting. PM me and I can send you my cell number.

Unfortunately the last round of chemo isn't the end of all this nonsense. For some of us there's radiation, then the estrogen blocker and that's on top of recovering from the SEs of chemo and radiation. And then there's the emotional toll. And for some of us . . . menopause induced by the chemo. Fun times. Mary, I'm envious of your hair growth. The only place it seems to be growing fast is on my legs. And I hadn't noticed it until yesterday when it caught the light. I couldn't feel it it was so soft! But boy, there was a lot of it growing, lol. Now if the top of my head would just catch up with the sides a bit more I'd breathe easier. Nanette. hope surgery went smoothly! I had a good cry the other day too. I think it has to do with the estrogen blocker I'm on, so I'll be watching that. I wasn't particularly sad or upset then had a wave of sadness overtake me and I started crying - what the heck is up with that!?!? Angie, have you been able to golf at all - even just for fun? I'm hoping you get to soon if not!!!!! Heading toward the weekend and daughter and her boyfriend are coming home for a couple of days!!!! Hope you all have a good one too. ",

Still have some neuropathy and other issues. Good news, it gets better. After my last treatment I had around 2 rather bad or at least blah weeks. Didn't feel much better even three weeks out. Started feeling better then jumped into radiation which has it's own form of extreme fatigue. But, again, it gets better. Yesterday I spent the day walking around the National Arboretum in Washington DC with my 21 year old daughter, then walking around on the national mall. She got tired before I did!!!!! (And she's a thin healthy college student who walks a lot!) Now, when we got back to our room to rest, she was able to recover a lot quicker than I could - I was done for the evening and we ordered Chinese in and played bananagrams.
