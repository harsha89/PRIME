      "Content": "May 17, 2015 02:31PM - edited May 17, 2015 02:35PM by ankledolphin Hey... so here is my story... grew up on Long Island, I'm the oldest to my two brothers, one a doctor in Philadelphia, the other a teacher in Maryland. I went to college in WNY, SUNY Brockport, met a guy in 1997, got married in 2003, had our daughter in June of 2010. I have been a member of the Batavia Area Jaycees since 2002, and on the board every since. Its a volunteer organization for young people...in which I am the oldest and was hoping to slow down some, but volunteerism in the area for this age group is almost at zero and I can't seem to walk away from things I have worked so hard for just to let it fall apart! I have slowed down a little, but its hard! About how I found out on the cancer: Had a routine exam the last week of dec 2014, and a week later found a large lump in my left breast. called for an appointment on my 39th bday to tell doc, i want the mammo i have been asking for, for the past 3 years. Doc admitted to me I was the third patient to come back to see her...so guess what, I want nothing to do with that office. Fast forward to now. Have had 3 chemo treatments....liver enzymes a little high so chemo on two drugs was reduced and no neulasta shot this weekend. I've been blogging a bit here and there on my experiences with chemo and stuff to keep friend and stuff informed...http://beaverdiva.blogspot.com/ :) ",

He did mention some clinical trial for my lumpectomy in regards to lymph node removal, but he was going to get me more info on it for review, plus I plan on talking with my brother about it. He is a doctor, but will talk with his other doc friends where he is from if I ask to make sure what will be best.

I do have some things I can take home and work on, so that is good if I need I love my MO, he has been great since I first met him. He wants to make sure I am going ok with things, before he sends me downstairs for chemo....he has a great bedside manner and actually takes time to listen to me and my husband and loves the list of questions I bring in everytime on various things. Last week I met with my surgeon and she mentioned she felt some hardness with could be from the biopsies I have had, since I do develop thick scars from past surgeries, so he was feeling around and thinks he finally felt what she was. I was able to see my first chemo nurse today and she surprised I was getting number 6 already! I dont always get the same nurse everytime I have gone in, but so far they were all pretty great. ",

Nurse at chemo said to drink more water! sunshine100\u2026 after treatments I mentioned I feel like an old lady (no offences to anyone on here!!!) but my knees are really achy\u2026.and I have mentioned the sharp pains in my arms to numbness, and it;s all side effects I was told\u2026 littleblueflowers \u2013 depending on your blood test you maybe able to get treatment\u2026 me and my husband were not thrilled yesterday at the two across from us during treatment since both of them were coughing really badly\u2026.to the point where the lady almost threw up\u2026.plus they were watching movies really loud, and I made a comment to the nurse about how loud its been in here today and she agreed\u2026it was bad\u2026but what can really be done about it\u2026so we let it go Addie29 \u2013 I got my period right after treatment 1 and haven't seen it since\u2026only 39, and the hot flashes that I am getting are driving me nuts, especially at night\u2026asked the MO about it and he said I have a 20-30% chance of my ovaries returning back to normal function\u2026.they asked me before I started all of these if I wanted to harvest any eggs and we passed on it\u2026we were hoping for baby #2, but me and my husband decided we didn't want to go that route and we are very blessed with our soon to be 5 year old\u2026 I did get the feeling by his look was, I'm not the one that can help with the hot flashes\u2026but I am the one getting rid of that tumor! I do really like my MO as a doctor\u2026he is very concerned on how I am feeling, how is this affecting me, how well am I tolerating things\u2026then we deal with what is the best course of action, since they did lower the dose on two of my drugs already\u2026 I did get the option to take the neulasta or not this time since my blood work was fine without it after #3\u2026so I am not taking it tomorrow.. I have yet to take any of my Zofran only during the chemo do they give it to me\u2026.have taken a few Ativan to help take edge off some\u2026but never took any between round 3 and 4\u2026but have noticed an increase in nausea, but hate adding more drugs into my system if I really don't need\u2026.a few Tylenol here and there for headache/pain\u2026 i also asked my MO before treatment yesterday if its normal to to feel drunk at times and slurring speech since that seems to happen to me at times during treatment...well, he said, the benedryl causes some of that (and it hit me almost immedially in a foggy feeling, since I had to stop typing) and one of my chemo drugs is in an alcohol solution...so for a person who stop drinking years ago since it just doesn't agree with me anymore....it hits big time....MO thought it was funny!",

Then at my first appointment with the surgeon she mentioned cure, but thought lets do some genetic test due to my age (39) and then when my tests back (everything was neg - had more then brca tested) and we thought we can do this with just a lumpectomy, it was then decided chemo first to see if the tumor shrinks before any surgery to make sure the chemo is working, the MO i now have also said cure....that is the ultimate goal with what i have. the place i go to is a cancer center, so they ultimately, want cure....and who wouldn't. Now after 5 rounds of chemo, in which 3 of them had a reduced dosage rate due to liver enzymes being high, i stress, was that the right decision,...to lower it...what if its not strong enough, what if a random cell in my lymph nodes starts going places...i guess its anxiety since i have an appointment on monday back with the surgeon to get that stuff all decided. on a side note....i work in a community where a lot of business people know me due to my job and the service club i have been a part of for over 13 years and when they find out what is going on and what i am going through, and that i am still working everyday, but on chemo days and stuff....they are surprised, and can't believe i have a good spirit and positive attitude...but honestly, at times it a huge act. I don't like to show how vulnerable i really am, or how inside this is literally killing me on how i see it affecting my daughter....does anyone else feel like they put on a show for public and even family, but when its just you, you are a total mess? i realize i am just totally rambling on...need to get my daughter in the bath before my mil picks her up for the day so she can play with her cousin who is visiting from AZ before they go back home tomorrow!!",
