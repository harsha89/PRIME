I had my lumpectomy a week ago and got mixed news back today. 0/1 lymph node involved, and really great margins around the 2.2 cm IDC.... BUT... they (pathology) found two spots of DCIS that couldn't be seen on the MRI. From what I can tell from the surgeon and the report, one was associated with the lump, and the other, was \"incidental\", and the margin around that was only .6 mm. So it's called \"multi-focal\" DCIS. Surgeon won't say what will be suggested, but possibly: -more lumpectomy to get bigger margin around that incidental DCIS, or -mastectomy because they don't know how much DCIS is there, and where it is, or -just go ahead with whole breast radiation as we had originally planned, since the DCIS is small, and should be gotten with the radiation I won't see my oncologist until 12/01. Does anyone have experience with this type of diagnosis? What did you do? I'm going ahead with getting an appointment set up for MDAnderson Cancer Center to see what they would suggest. This forum helped me make some decisions about when/if I would get a second opinion, and go to the cancer center. Thanks everyone! Jennifer",

There's nothing that can be felt in the nodes or seen on ultrasound in them, and there was no lymphatic vessel invasion present from the path report. Can't see the oncologist until Nov 3rd. Of course I've done a ton of reading, and I'm very optimistic. I'm just wondering if I'm doing right thing about picking docs. I live 20 miles (45 minutes) from Houston and M.D. Anderson, one of the premiere cancer centers in the world, and I am going to the local oncologist and surgeon recommended by my gyno. My mom really wants me to go to M.D.Anderson. I feel like the convenience outweighs the rest... I have to keep working through this, and my hospital, radiation, and doctors are all about 5 minutes away. My thoughts are that this type of cancer is very common and very treatable, and that it doesn't necessarily need the premiere cancer center in the world. Any thoughts? I am truly grateful to have found this forum. I love that the signatures show types and treatments. Everyone is different, but we all have something in common.

My gyno sent blood for the gene testing, but I'm not sure how to request the oncotype test on the cancer tissue. I guess they would do that from the surgery or can they do it from the core biopsy sample? Seems like so much to learn so fast.",

I talked to friend of mine who is a doctor, and whose mom went through pancreatic cancer. She used MD Anderson for all her specialists, but was able to have them prescribe her ongoing therapies to more local providers. We'll see how it goes. I have come to realize that somehow, in my head, I've been believing that it's not really cancer unless I have to get chemo... or unless I have to have a mastectomy. Did anyone else go through that kind of thinking? Jen",

I finished 15/22 today, and although I really want to be upbeat-this is no big deal-happy face for the whole world girl.... sometime this shit just sucks, and it makes me feel a little better to know I'm not the only one. Here's my rant... red, itchy, weepy bumps, mostly on chest where I've gotten more sun exposure in my life, and it's a part where they are using electrons instead of protons (whatever that means :) Dog tired (drive in traffic at 6am, rads at 7:15am, drive in more traffic until 8:30am and work until 6pm... eat...fall into bed and do it again) And I sprained my ankle a couple of weeks ago, and it just doesn't seem to be healing at all... So... bitch moan bitch moan. But on the other hand, there are a bunch of amazing, supportive people here who mostly ARE upbeat, and happy, and don't mind too much if you need to complain some. And I am reminded of how very lucky I am. And I'll be at 18/22 at the end of this week... and then at the end of next week, I'll be ringing the bell (that's what they do at MDAnderson when you finish rads) Happy day everyone, and thank you all so much for being here!",

It's my left side and they have me doing the deep breathing to keep the heart and lungs away from the radiation field. On Wednesday, it was like everything had changed, and I couldn't keep the bar in the right spot with my breathing anymore. I ended up shaking to get it to stay there, and that scared me that I was radiating myself to death with the shaking, and then I started crying... Suffice to say, Wednesday sucked. We got it worked out yesterday, and today was great, but has anyone else had that problem? I haven't read anybody's story about the breathing part, or any problems with it.",
