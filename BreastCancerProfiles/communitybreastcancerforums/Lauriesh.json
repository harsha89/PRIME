As he just grabs the handle, she shoves him (hard) with her right hand in his  chest and he goes flying backward, then starts crying. My daughter doesn't say anything, she just keeps riding.  The other mom looks horrified, so of course, I apologize to the mom, and explain that she has two older brothers, and is used to defending herself.  Secretly, I am  trying not  laugh, and I am thinking, \"you go girl, don't let anyone push you around\"  She is now 9, and is still feisty.

Finding one small liver tumor and having a resection doesn't increase the chance of remaining Ned any longer than someone who had several large mets, did chemo and got to Ned. I remember reading somewhere that by the time a tumor can be seen on a scan it is already made up of over a million cells. All it takes is one of those cellS to survive and to multiply at another site. There is so much that is unknown about mets. In some women, the mets spread everywhere quickly, where with others, such as me, I had very large liver tumors ( one was 11 cm), but had not spread anywhere else, eventhough the cancer was in my blood, as my tumer markers had doubled when I was diagnosed. Er+ cancer likes the bones, but for some reason er- doesn't. Not saying that er- women never get bone mets, but it is not common. There are women who were diagnosed after me, with lower tumor volume in their liver, so their cancer was \" caught early\" , with the same cancer profile, who had resection who have already passed or are still living, but quickly had a recurrence and still doing chemo now. My cancer was not caught early, yet I have been Ned for almost 3 years. Why? I was lucky, I responded well to treatment. If you talk to other long term survivors on these boards, they will tell you the same thing. It is a crap shoot. There are some women who are long term Ned on the her2 site, like 10 - 15 years, and neither one of them had their cancer caught early. One had it in multiple spots, including the brain, and the other had her liver covered in mets. Yet, here they are still Ned while I am sure they have seen many women in the last 10 years who \" caught their mets early\" yet still died a few years later.",

I just can't imagine that diet can play such a huge role in these and other diseases, yet somehow plays no role in cancer.

We carried out a retrospective study of long-term outcome of all patients with HER2-positive MBC treated in our institutions with chemotherapy and trastuzumab before March 2007. All patients had histology-proven, HER2-positive (3+ on immunohistochemistry and/or HER2/neu gene amplification on FISH) breast cancer. None had received adjuvant trastuzumab. Eighty-four patients were treated from May 2000 to March 2007 (Table 1). Thirteen (15%) achieved CR as defined according to RECIST 1.0 criteria [3]. As part of different institutional practices, patients in Dublin continued on trastuzumab until progression or at least for five years. In Milan trastuzumab was generally stopped in CR patients within two years of achieving remission. As of March 17, 2012, (median follow up 7 years, range 2.5-11.8 years), six of these patients remain alive and continuously cancer free at 142, 139, 122, 101, 84, and 84 months. Two additional patients are alive and continuously free of metastatic cancer at 107 and 105 months, having received curative locoregional therapy for new primary breast cancers. Five patients who achieved CR have developed relapsed MBC, at 44, 37, 35, 30, and 15 months, two while receiving maintenance trastuzumab (at 44 and 37 months, respectively). Three others had discontinued trastuzumab (21, 8, and 4 months after cessation). View this table: In this window In a new window Table 1. Characteristics of patients All of the eight DCR patients received trastuzumab together with their first chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Five (63%) DCR patients had estrogen receptor (ER) negative disease, and five had metastases limited to liver. All but one received a taxane-containing regimen with trastuzumab (docetaxel and carboplatin-4 and single agent taxane-3). The median duration of trastuzumab for CR patients in the two institutions was 67 months (range: 49 to 107+) in Dublin and 14 months (range 5-26) in Milan. Interestingly, although the frequency of CR was very similar in the two institutions (Milan 16% and Dublin 15%), the proportion of patients with DCR was higher in Dublin than Milan (11% versus 6%, respectively), prompting speculation that the duration of trastuzumab therapy might be important. This is the first reported series of long-term follow-up of patients with HER2-positive MBC who achieved CR following chemotherapy and trastuzumab. Our data suggest that a meaningful minority of patients achieve very prolonged complete remissions. Although the small numbers and the retrospective nature of the study preclude definitive statistics, the data also suggest that the impact of trastuzumab might be greater in patients with ER-negative disease (14% DCR-an observation consistent with trials conducted in earlier stage disease [4, 5]) and possibly in those with metastases confined to the liver. Furthermore, the complete absence of DCR among patients who received trastuzumab with their second or subsequent chemotherapy for metastatic disease suggests that this agent should be a component of initial treatment. For patients with ER-negative disease who received trastuzumab with first line chemotherapy, the DCR rate is 16%. At present we are conducting a comprehensive molecular and cytogenetic study of these patients' tumor samples to identify a subset of patients with HER2-positive MBC who are more likely to achieve DCR following chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. We hypothesize that overtly HER2-positive MBC may be a potentially curable disease. Laurie",

I think it is wrong for someone who is terminally ill (which she is) to have a baby.  No one knows how much time she has. Not her dr,  or her friends. There have been women who have had \"only\" bone mets, who progressed rapidly and died within a year. The fact that she dotes on a dog does not make her good mother material. I am sorry if I sound harsh but I think it is an incredibly selfish decision.  Those of us with young children know that the most devastating part of this is that our children are going to have to grow up without a mother. If your friend does this, she is knowingly subjecting her child to go through what will be one of the most horrible experiences of their life- watching their mother die.",

If my next scan shows the cancer is back, I would do Kadcyla and Perjeta.   After that, It would probably be xeloda, Her & per. If you haven't had tykerb, that would be another option. ( I also did a year of tykerb, that first year I was ned, and had so many side effects, I had to stop. I think the only way I would do tykerb again would be if I developed brain mets) I will be 46 in a couple of weeks, and my kids are now 11, 14 and 15.

Drs are relying on studies that show there is a benefit of being on both the drugs at the same time ( they work synergistically ).  If they thought that it was best to save perjeta until a woman failed on herceptin, they wouldn't be giving both at the same time to newly diagnosed . I read an article by a Harvard researcher who was disagreeing with the method of staying on one targeted therapy until it failed, and then going on to the next. He believed that it was best to use 2 or even 3 at the same time, as you are hitting different mutations at the same time, and it increases the chances of killing all the cancer cells. Don't know if his theory is right, but to me, it is worth a try. I also did a year of her/ tykerb,  and after reading the Harvard researchers theory, I am really glad that I did. Laurie",

If I would not have done chemo, I would have had at the most, 6 months, as my cancer was agressive and it was already affecting my liver functions. I did chemo for 6 months, and while it was difficult, I continued to function pretty normally through it.  The liver tumor is gone and I have now been in remission for 2 years. I am 45 and have 3 kids, 15 ,13 and 10.  Because of chemo, I have had 3 years of birthdays, christmases, easters, vacations. I have seen my oldest start high school and my youngest will start middle school next year. Tell my kids that chemo is a waste of time and never works. I know that the cancer may come back, but I also know that  3-6 % of mbc patients have normal life spans after going into remission.  I hope I am one of them, but even if I am not, I have had 3 wonderful years with my kids that I would have never had if it wasn't for chemo. I am not \"one in a million\", there are other women on this site with similar situations. there are some that have been in remission for 8 years, five years, etc who all benefitted from chemo.

He assured my dh that if the appeal was denied, they would cover it.

For example, if 10 years ago a woman had said that her alt dr told her she should sit out in the sun every day for 30 minutes, you would have criticized her that she was crazy, how would that possibly help her. We now know there is a link between low vitamin d levels and breast cancer. My dr ( a reg onc, not an alt dr) now regularly tests patients for vitamin d and treats aggressively, with prescription doses, those women who are difficient. You would probably criticize someone who says she tries to buy organic natural products, to avoid environmental toxins, as none has been conclusively proven to cause breast cancer. Yet, I recently saw an article on the her2 support site where large concentrations of parabens have been found in breast tissue of women who have breast cancer. Does this prove that it causes cancer or removing them from our products could help us with cancer, no it doesn't. Will science find a concrete link someday, they may, just as they found a link between asbestos and mesothelioma. I am sure you would criticize someone who is using meditation or guided imagery to help fight their cancer. Right? That's crazy, isn't it. Did you see a recent study from Harvard where over 20% of people taking a placebo had improvements in their depression. A researcher had commented \"that some studies have suggested that people's beliefs about their therapy play a key role in whether they get better\" So, while it is not scientifically proven, yet, that our mind can play a role in healing us, it is not a reason to dismiss the possibility or criticize those who think it might help. How about the Kanzius machine. I am sure if you read about a machine that could cure cancer, you would have laughed. How is stupid is that, right? Well, it showed enough promise that it is now being tested at MD Anderson. I don't believe in a conspiracy theory, that there is a cure out there that is being kept from us,but I do keep an open mind. I take supplements that may have some benefit, such as curcumin, even though it has not been conclusively proven to help fight breast cancer. Science continually changes and i think you are being short sighted if you dismiss everything that is \"alternative\" as being worthless and a waste of money. Laurie",

I finished in Feb. and hard to say if it helped or not.  I have my pet scan on Tues., so I'll see if I am still NED. This vaccine has been around for awhile and had some good results in earlier trial members. They are now taking the original vaccine and adding ampligen, which they are hoping will help boost the immune response. I had to go off of Herceptin and Tykerb for 4 months while I did the trial, which was a little nerve wracking, but I am glad I did the trial. Laurie",

I think the Herceptin could be causing the joint pain as I am on a 3 month break while I am doing a vaccine trial, and my horrible joint pain is gone. I am on no hormonals, as er/pr-., so it has to be the Herceptin.   Laurie",

My onc said we would just take it month by month, keeping an eye on my tumor markers.  Unfortunately, there are also a few women who stopped herceptin after being Ned for 6 or 7 years and the cancer came back pretty quickly. It is such a hard decision to make. Leggo,  I don't think I understand what she said that was so upsetting. I may have to go read it again and see if I missed something.",

I asked my onc this, as when I was early stage every year that I was ned, he would tell me that my risk of recurrence was getting lower (this is true for er/pr-, I know it is a little different if your er/pr+) He said this was not true now that I am stage 4.  The risk that the cancer will come back is very high, and even if I am ned for 5 or 7 or 10 years, the risk is very high.  At first I didn't want to believe him, but then there is a woman on the Her2 support site who was ned for like 6 or 7 years on Herceptin. she decided to stop and about 6 months later, the cancer returned to her liver. I thought that really confirmed what my onc was saying.  A related question I have and I have asked 4 oncs and I stumped them all, is \"how are the cancer cells that are now floating in my body any different from the cells that were floating in my body in 2008?\"  I was diagnosed stage 2 in 2005, and finished my year of herceptin in 2006 and was on no further treatment. There were cancer cells that were in me but yet had not metastatized until 2010.  I had had pet scans in 2008 and 2009 that were clear, so I know the mets weren't there all along. the only onc that could tell me any difference that he knows of, is one from Mayo that I saw , that said that the cells that are now floating in me, are not only resistant to AC, taxol and Herceptin, but now resistant to taxotere, carboplatin, tykerb and Herceptin. All of the other oncs just sort of shrugged their shoulders and couldn't give me any concrete differences between them.   Laurie",

I have been Ned for 3 1/2 years and all of the drs I see have never used that word. My onc, when discussing my scans uses the term \" disease free\"  . I use the term remission when I post on caringbridge or talking to friends and family because that is the term they are familiar with. I agree with divine that remission is not associated with cured. I think that is why that term was probably first used, to clarify that the person is not cured, they are only in remission. I think that most people,in the general public,  if you asked them what it meant to be in remission, woud say that there are no signs of cancer right now. Exactly what Ned means also. I think I know who you are talking about and I guess I have no problem with what she is saying.  While I don't say it out loud, I hope I  am in that 2-5 % that \" may be cured\" also.  Who wouldn't? I think getting to Ned is the first step in having a chance of being in that small % who live a normal lifespan and I think that is what she is celebrating . Laurie",

I had two liver tumors, with the largest being 11 cm. I had chemo, than rfa. I was diagnosed almost a year ago, and have read all I could about resection, rfa and other options.  I think it is strange that they are talking about doing a resection, but not removing  all of the cancer from the liver.  I have never read of someone that had a resection that wasn't going to remove all of the cancer (or at least what the scans can show) from the liver.  some concerns I would have is how long would you have to be off chemo after the resection? Since you still have other sites of cancer, wouldn't it be a risk to stop chemo? I would also ask if you are a candidate for rfa. It is a much easier procedure (outpatient) with a much easier recovery.  I was told that if I had a resection, I would be in the hospital for 4 days, with at least 6 weeks for a full recovery. If I were you, I would go for a second opinion. I went to two large cancer centers, and got two very different reccomendations.       Laurie",

I do also think it is insensitive. I lost my mother to cancer (not breast) and I would have never went on a site dedicated to stage 4 people fighting for their lives, and post the details of my mother's death or ask how I am going to live without her, I am so devasted, etc. and then expect these people to console me or give me advice of how to move on, etc. When people on this board respond to these posts, it's usually based on being a caregiver for a family member.

I have been Ned for almost 2 1/2 years and at my last scan in may, I only had to take 1, the morning I was waiting for the call with the results . I am getting better at blocking out the what ifs, and just staying in the moment. I keep busy, doing fun things and not so fun things ( I realized my house is always the cleanest when it is scan time, my dh would probably like it if I had scans more than just twice a year.) I had a cousin, who was 42 and healthy, die suddenly of cardiac arrest. No warning, no good bye to his wife and kids. I think about him a lot when I begin stressing out and remind myself to enjoy this day, this moment . I was seeing a therapist for awhile and she told me to focus on the saying \" today I am healthy and cancer free \". And yeah, we know that it is not completely true, that there are probably cancer cells floating through our body, but sitting in a quiet spot and repeating that phrase does help me calm down and stay in the moment, instead of the what ifs and worry.

I was 38 at the time and in excellent health (on no meds and a year out from any treatments)  If I was facing this as a stage 4, as I am now, I personally would not have the surgery. I would have implants. If you have more questions about NOLA or the procedure, feel free to pm me. Laurie",
