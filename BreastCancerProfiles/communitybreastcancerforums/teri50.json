I love your hair.  I'm 6 months out from chemo and my hair is probably an inch long and curly most days.   Have had one trim to get it evened up. My hairstylist said it helps hair growth when you get  your blood moving.  So another good reason to exercise.  Also giving your head a good massage everyday will help.   Both are easy enough to do.  I'm also using Nioxin.  She said she'd hear that is a good product.  I love having some hair again.  lol.
