      "Content": "HopeToMakeIt wrote: I was recently diagnosed with lung mets and my  onc decided that the first line of treatment for me would be Xeloda + Avastin. I got my first infusion of Avastin 2 weeks ago and yesterday I received an email from the chemo nurse saying that my insurance is refusing to pay for the Avastin saying it is experimental! My onc spoke with the insurance doctor personally and tried to persuade him to approve it, the insurance doc refused and then it went to an independent review committe which denied it too... So basically my onc is now saying that we will go with Xeloda alone and they will not be able to give me Avasitn. I have BCBS PPO insurance, I thought we had one of the best coverages possible but apparently that is not true. I was so upset yesterday and was thinking that the whole world is conspiring against me... am much more relaxed today and hence am turning to you ladies for advice... Is there anything I can do from my end to push the insurance to cover it? Are many people still getting Avastin? I was told by my onc's office that since it is under FDA scrutiny, it is getting harder and harder to get insurance to pay for it. Are people seeing good results with Avastin and would I be losing out if I can't get it...DH and I have discussed paying for it ourselves but it is supposed to be very expensive ...Isnt it hard enough that we have to deal with the diagnosis and the treatment that goes with it... but now we have to fight to get medication!!!!...

There are a few nodules in my right lung and 2 nodules in my left. I am meeting with my oncologist on Monday  to discuss chemo plan. I did chemo (AC + taxol) during my first diagnosis and it was very hard on me... I wanted to know which chemo regime usually works well for lung mets and if it is tolerable...i am very scared and am hoping to hear if it is possible to beat it and live a good life. I am married to my childhood sweetheart of 14 years since 2006....  Dx 10/15/2010, Stage IV, 1/11 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
