      "Content": "BalkanHope wrote: Hello good people. My friend (32) just received PET scan results confirming mets in her sternum and revealing some in her vertebrae. Her soft tissue and organs are clean. Before the PET scan when the sternum mets were only suspected, the docs were talking about radiation. But now all of the docs have agreed to put her on Zometa, without Â radiation and with no more chemo. And she'll be starting Herceptin. She is asymptomatic/pain free. Can anyone help explain why the docs changed their minds about radiation? And what are some of the possible roads ahead? Thank you. I wrote to this forum earlier and received warm and helpful responses, and I have learned a lot from the stories you share. Log in to post a reply",
