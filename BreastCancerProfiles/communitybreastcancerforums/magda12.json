I'd also like to think you for your reply (even though it wasn't to me :D) because I'm in a similar situation and nervously waiting for the whole process to start. Your words put me at ease. Hopefully I'll get your results too. :)",

My entire family is advising me to do this and frankly, part of me wants to forget it and think of more pleasant things. All this researching is truly stressful (my back's been killing me this whole week) and so not fun. I get it. HOWEVER. The alternative, to me, is worse. Docs are not perfect and they have many patients and someone might fall through the cracks when everything \"seems\" fine. As unpleasant as it may be, I will do my very best to not be that someone that falls through the cracks and understand as much as I can. :) I will be stressed, but informed and I will gently annoy my docs until I am satisfied that this is truly nothing. :D",

However, at 36, I am having a BC scare (lump on left breast, invisible in both mammo and u/s, felt by doc) and even if I come out clean from this awful experience, I read that not having kids after 35 tremendously raises your risk to develop it. Big time. I have FH (paternal grandma died from in her early 40's, dad had colon cancer now in remission), dense breasts and for many years, I drank a lot of alcohol. :( And, as mentioned, I don't have kids. Is it smarter/less selfish to forget the dream? Is there any way I could super protect myself if I do decide to procreate? Crap, I wish I had looked into this a decade ago. :( Thanks for any advice.

I joined a forum of colon cancer patients when my dad was diagnosed and I was impressed by how much more informed and helpful the patients were than many doctors. Truly grateful for them, and for you as well. This is the article I read: http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/NotHavingChildrenorHavingFirstAfterAge35.html While I was very preoccupied about having a baby a few years back, my thinking now is that perhaps there's a reason I didn't get the chance. If it happens, it happens and I will do what's in my power to take care of myself. Again, thank you all.",
