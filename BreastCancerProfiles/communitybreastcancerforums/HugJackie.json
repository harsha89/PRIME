I am strongly considering having bilateral mastectomy since I am so young and there are so many years for a recurrence to happen.  At the same time, I am scared that I might be taking too drastic measures and taking on more risk with the bilateral mastectomy.  Obviously the pathology of the lumpectomy will influence my decision, but all signs so far point to the cancer being confined to a small lump.  I would greatly appreciate it if anyone has faced a similar decision and is willing to share how they came to their decision. Thanks, Jackie",
