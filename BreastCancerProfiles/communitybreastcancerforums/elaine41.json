I love reading all your posts, it truly keeps me sane having people that truly \"get it\" Elaine",

Thanks, Elaine ",

I have an x-ray next week and then will start radiation.  I wasn't told not to wear a bra, but was told a sports bra may be more comfortable.  I was also told to use cornstarch, but no deodorant.  I am quite fair skinned and worried about burns, so I appreciate the suggestions about creams.  Also I am on tamoxifen, my rad. onc.  said it is not usual for patients to be on tamoxifen while receiving rads.  I questioned my onc. about this and he said it is fine and to continue it during radiation.  Anyone else taking tamoxifen during radiation?",
