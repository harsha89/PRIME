I have a 2-year old and was trying to conceive when I was diagnosed. I have been through the ringer since my diagnosis. I am not yet at a place where I can give you much hope, though hopefully I will be able to do that when the dust has settled. But I can tell you what my experience has been like and what I have learned. And maybe commiserate with you. One thing I have found- there is hope in talking to other women who have dealt and are dealing with this.",

It took about 6 months, lumpectomy, chemo, and a few rounds of radiation. I am almost through with this battle. I hope you are getting through yours ok.",
