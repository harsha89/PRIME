I found a lump two months ago and after a diagnostic mammogram and core needle biopsy, have been diagnosed with fibrocystic changes. I go for excisional biopsy next week, because while pathology shows b9, there is a slight chance of DCIS hiding behind it. I would go for a second opinion, but maybe wait until August when you are back in the US. How big is the lump? Mine is oval, about 2.5cm x .8cm. Hard to tell though because its connected to all the fibrous tissue in the breast. You've come to the right place. This site and forums are a great source of information and support.",
