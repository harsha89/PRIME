I have sensitive skin so at first I thought it was just my skin reacting to the hot water, or maybe was some weird allergic reaction to something but noticed after a week that it hadn't gone away. After a few more weeks, I googled my symptoms (bad idea, I know) & the 3 most seemingly similar conditions that came up were IBC, Paget's, & mastitis. I've never been pregnant, & hadn't experienced any pain or swelling in the area so I feel like the chances of it being mastitis are slim. I have seen 2 different nurse practitioners for a clinical breast exam (both said they think it's unlikely that I have IBC, but one of them had also said that she'd never seen IBC before) & am waiting on my health insurance enrollment to go through so I can see a breast specialist. I had an ultrasound done on the affected breast about 3 weeks ago (they told me everything looked normal, with the exception of mild skin thickening on the pink spot, but I've also read that IBC doesn't always come up on a US). The nurse practitioner who has seen IBC a few times before noticed a couple of lumpy areas in my right breast that don't seem to be present in my left one (nothing came up on the US to suggest that it's cancerous) & said my pink spot looked like a fungal infection to her, so she put me on Miconazole, which I've been applying for about a month with little to no skin changes. I followed up with her last week & she still seemed more concerned about the lumpiness in my breast than the pink spot on it. I'm aware of the symptoms of Paget's breast disease & at this point am more worried about that than IBC. My symptoms include:The pink patch around my right nipple. Neither my areola or my nipple itself is abnormally reddened; it's just on the skin of my breast surrounding my areola. I noticed the color of it changes sometimes, but it has been pretty light the last week or 2. It started off as a medium/bright pink shade but would fluctuate between that color & being so light it was hardly noticeable. Lately it's been more on the side of being hardly noticeable. It doesn't seem to have changed in size at all since I first noticed it & there is no pain, scaliness/crustiness or itching anywhere on the breast. I don't think I have peau d'orange because although the follicles on my affected breast are slightly visible, you can also see them on my unaffected breast and compared to pictures I've seen of peau d'orange, it's very, very subtle. I think the pinkness of the patch on my breast may just be making the follicles a little more noticeable. The skin feels smooth with no palpable ridges & there isn't any dimpling that I can see. My right breast is normally slightly bigger than my left one, especially around my period. It's been a week since my last period & my breast still feels slightly more full on the outer/upper area & I can feel a couple of little 'flat' lumps where my NP pointed them out. I'm not sure if my nipple is inverting because I have both nipples pierced & am not sure if the piercings could block the nipple from inverting or not. I feel like the nipple on my affected breast is slightly smaller in circumference than my left one & sometimes gets flat, but my left one flattens at times too, just looks bigger than my right one. Most of the time they both have a pretty equal roundness to them & neither of them secrete any discharge. I'm 22 years old & am of a healthy weight & a pretty healthy lifestyle. BC runs fairly strong in my family (my mother passed away at 40 of IBC & my maternal grandmother passed away at 39 of IDC) so even though I'm much younger than they were when they got it, I'm still quite worried as there doesn't seem to be any other possibilities to what this could be that I'm aware of. I apologize for the very long read, but if any of you have been diagnosed with IBC or Paget's & had symptoms like mine, please let me know. I realize none of you are doctors but I would still like some peace of mind until I can get in to see the specialist. Log in to post a reply",

The surgeon has seen many women who had IBC or Paget's and he thinks I definitely don't have either of them. I requested an MRI just to be absolutely sure, and he said that would be a wise idea. He believes that a biopsy would've been overkill, which I agree with. My insurance authorized the MRI so I'm going to make an appointment asap. I've also been keeping my piercings very clean & applying emu oil on them a few times a day ever since my appointment & the red spots already seem to be going away. I also recently let my father know about what's been going on (he has been through medical school & has a very good understanding of the human body, & of breast cancer from being alongside my mother during her fight) & he also said he thinks that judging by my symptoms, it's unlikely that I have IBC or Paget's. When I told him what the surgeon said, he said that if he had known I had my nips pierced he would have suggested the infection thing first too!)",
