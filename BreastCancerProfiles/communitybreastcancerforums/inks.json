I always had trouble feeding my baby on right side and when I stopped breastfeeding I noticed lumps. I assumed they were clogged ducts. I kept feeling hot constantly too, but I had thyrotoxicosis after the birth of my daughter so I am not sure if my cancer and night sweats were related, though they did continue even after my thyroid condition normalized. 6 months later I got a little dent in my breast and I went to my PCP. The rest is history. Since you are young and recently breastfed it is likely that your problems are not caused by cancer but you made a good decision by getting a mammogram. If your mammogram comes back negative you should ask your PCP to check your thyroid levels. Do you have family history of breast cancer? I hope your mammo is negative. Hugs!",

The fact that you have had symptoms for 5 moths is a good indicator that you have something else going on. But it's a good idea to see breast specialist to figure out what is going on with you. A breast MRI might be overkill but if they find something concerning they will do an US, you could ask specifically if they can explain what is going on with your underarm lymphnodes since you complain of pain there. Could the bursitis have inflamed your lymphnodes? What treatment did you get for bursitis?",

This study suggests that such patients may benefit from additional therapy to improve LC and thus perhaps should be considered for RT after mastectomy. Further study is required. Here is a study that finds poorer outcome with multifocal multicentric tumors http://bmcsurg.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2482-15-1 Our results indicate that MF/MC cancers have a negative impact on prognosis and are related to higher loregional and distant relapse independently from the type of surgery performed. Adjuvant therapies did not modify the poorer outcome, but in patients receiving adjuvant anthacyclines, the differences with unicentric tumors were reduced. Our data support the hypothesis that MF/MC tumors may have a worse biological behavior and that the presence of multiple foci should be considered in planning adjuvant treatments.",

My breast cancer was found after I stopped breastfeeding so I looked into the postpartum breast cancer stuff and apparently there is major changes going on in breast during that time: \"Breast tissues undergo massive transformations during pregnancy in preparation for nursing the new infant. After milk production has ended, there is a cascade of cell death. \"This cell death removes about 90 percent of breast epithelial cells during a very short window of time, which triggers widespread remodeling and repair of breast tissue by the immune system,\" explained Cook. During this remodeling, immune cells called macrophages operate like tiny Pac-Man arcade game characters, gobbling up the dying cells before the dying cells can release intracellular contents which can provoke immune attack. As another safeguard against immune attack, macrophages that 'eat' dying cells also secrete immune suppressive factors. Macrophages use one molecule \u2014 MerTK \u2014 to control both of those processes.\" http://news.vanderbilt.edu/2014/10/potential-therapy-for-postpartum-breast-cancer-investigated/ Have any of the doctors you've seen considered it to be connected with recently giving birth. If you look into the postpartum breast cancer reaserch and articles they keep mentioning the \"wound healing process\" that is going on after you stop breastfeeding and the cells die off. Could you have an inflammatory reaction to those milk producing cells dieing off? You need to see a doctor who is familiar with breast issues and can solve your 5 month long puzzle.",

Since they are measuring your ones together that gives you a fairly large lesion, the cutoff for getting radiation after mastectomy is 4cm (if I remember it right).

You should not have surgery just because you are scared, you need to base it on the facts and benefits to you. But if you feel like screening is not enough for you and you do want to take more active measures a consultation with a breast surgeon and a plastic surgeon would be a place to start. As far as cost is concerned - you are already dealing with the cost of the screenings. If you end up leaning towards mastectomy you really need to seriously consider reconstruction and the studies about quality of life, self image and all the emotional effectsÂ  - and again your surgeon would be most helpful to discuss the benefits of reconstruction. While all surgeries have risks my own experience so far has been that at the age of 37 mastectomy and reconstruction have been fairly painless and easy.

I could not lift my baby for 2 days after the biopsy. Since it was a consult before biopsy it is weird that the surgeon did not discuss these things with you at the consult. You can change your surgeon after the biopsy if indeed you end up having cancer. But try to stay calm for now and don't jump ahead of things. You should definetly change the surgeon if you biopsy is positive if you are not comfortable with this surgeon since you would be seeing her every 3-6 months for 2 years. Find out what you have first and then look into what you would have to do to treat it. Hugs!",

She was DX in the fall of '16, chemo , surgery, but after surgery the cancer returned around the MX scar, so she got more chemo and radiation. While at radiation the cancer started to move to the other breast, biopsy confirmed it was now triple negative and she is back on chemo but still has visible cancer. Only bone and ct scans done and all clear. They have told her that they are not going to operate on the other breast. So is she still considered stage III, just locally advanced and non operable? My question is if her cancer is TN now but original was HR+ should she still be on hormone blockers or not? And should she be on bone meds since she is so high risk for mets? She also had Oncodeep done (similar to Caris and Foundation One) but she has already become resistant to one of the drugs (it worked great in the beginning). The report is suggesting Metformin an Rapamune (same class as Afinitor but a lot cheaper). Has anyone had any experience or maybe even success using non conventional breast cancer drugs after cancer sensitivity testing? She is in Estonia, they have universal health care but a lot of the newer drugs are not covered, so the cost of drugs is crucial. Thank you in advance for any insight you have to offer!",

So that's what's puzzling, should she be on some form of hormone blocker? She paid out of pocket for the cancer sensitivity test and one of the meds that would work for her is Afinitor, but I be it's the cost why she is not getting it. Metformin and Rapamune were options too, and they are way cheaper, Rapamune is also an MTOR inhibitor just like Afinitor so I'm hoping she could try that. She is going for chemo on Wednesday so I hope she can talk to her doctor. Her report has the part about genes, and somebody handwrote next to ERBB2 - HER2. But the report must have been in color and I only have the black and white version since it talks about highlighted and non highlighted genes. So I have no clue what that means. But I'll tell her to ask her doctor if that would give her a treatment option. I already checked the clinical trials for her and there are none that are recruiting.

Both ROs recommended radiation also because of my age (37) so I did it mainly because if I were to get a chest wall recurrence the outlook would be pretty bad. IMRT radiation is a little better at sparing the heart so try to consult with an RO that can provide that.

I think it's great that you are having it checked out. If you are breast feeding they prefer that you pump or feed your baby right before mammogram or ultrasound. It sounds that you will have fine needle aspiration, where they will try to suck some cells into a syringe to be tested. The core needle biopsy that I had was no biggie, they gave me an ice pack and told to take ibuprofen. Depending on what side your suspicious spot is you may want to have someone else to drive you, the seat belt may feel uncomfortable. I drove myself and I was fine. The problem will be picking up the baby afterwards, they do not want you to lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk. Do not stop breastfeeding until you get your biopsy results.

Lumpectomy with radiation is equal to mastectomy and the lumpectomy recommendation has nothing to do with having HMO (radiation is rather expensive too). You could ask about neoadjuvant chemo (chemo before surgery) since if tumor does not respond to chemo you could get more chemo after the surgery. The new recommendation is that if there is not complete pathologic response you could get more carboplatin. And also make sure they give you platinum based chemo since you are HR-.

Any stretching just a little to where you will feel the pain will help. You will see noticeable difference if you do the stretching 3 times a day, your pain will lessen and you will regain range of motion. My PT did not break my cording, he said it's enough to just have it stretched to the max to where it does not hurt. Even after PT the cording may keep coming back several times. I sleep my arm straight up under my pillow whenever I feel the cording again. You arm will feel better if you are religious about the exercises. I hope you get to PT soon.",

My lymph node was enlarged in ultrasound and MRI, I ended up with micromets in the lymph node but I never found out if it was the enlarged lymph node that had them. My grandmother had cancer only in her lymph node but I have no idea how that would look on a ultrasound. You at least deserve an explanation from your doctors.",

But they could not confirm that the lymph node had cancer without a lymph node biopsy. The surgeon did not want the lymph node biopsied and in hindsight it probably would not have shown cancer since it was only a micromet and isolated tumor cells. Even right after surgery I was declared node negative. When the final pathology came it had the micromet and isolated tumor cells. So in my case there was such a low volume of cancer in the lymph node that the US and MRI were not conclusive. I think it's great that you had the US done at a breast center since they are a higher volume facility and see all sorts of things. Maybe you can get another mammogram and ultrasound in 3 months if you still have the lump and enlarged lymph node. I still find it weird that they can't explain your lymph node.",

Were you just multifocal or were you both multicentric and multifocal? What is your age? It is known that sometimes the only benefit from chemo is menopause, so you could look into ovarian supression either with tamoxifen or an AI. Would a milder chemo be an option? Will you get radiation for the micromet in lymphnode? It's a tough descision and either way there are no guarantees.",
