It was me who started the thread about dense breasts should I be worried? I had been told by one consultant that I had extremely dense breasts - grade 3 to 4 and that I should have an MRI - which I did. Thus had been done by him in his office with an US - not by a clinic with a trained radiologist. I went back to my original place for the MRI - I was due on but the team said it realty did not matter as it would make no difference in how they read the results as their radiologists know what to look for. My consultant who heads up this team is an internationally renowned consultant and surgeon said that for under menopause it should not be an obsessional concern. He is going to give me my density grading at my next mammogram but for my previous one I had both digital mammogram and ultrasound and now MRI. All are fine. Plus he has also clinically checked them. He found a lump not picked up by mammogram or US!!!!!! Figure that - it freaked me out. What I'm trying to say is that I'm glad I am aware of density and how it can affect my risks but I need to put the trust in the team that looks after me, have my regular checks and do things to help lower density. I'm trying not to worry unduly. It does appear that mammogram alone is not great for cancer detection in dense breasts - but is thiswith digital mammogrsphy? If not then definitely request more imaging.",

I mentioned re not being able to see IBC on either and she said that that is actually not true, and there was nothing abnormal to see in the first place. I did look up a link that I think is actually really well written www.breastcare.com/common_clinical_inflammatory.htm. It says that whilst MRI can not always distinguish between cancer and the infection, it will highlight areas of abnormality - so whilst it can't always diagnose IBC it can highlight where it might be. In my case they are saying that there is nothing abnormal to see. I also found another interesting article www.springerlink.com/content/47173477t6281465. In this one it says that MRI is th most accurate in diagnosing IBC (bar biopsy). I mentioned my rash which is pale pink and cool to touch, my breasts are not swollen etc and they have said more like a skin reaction.  As the consultant is away I am due to see him in 10 days time when he is back so I figure that if my symptoms have not gone by then I will mention it and ask about a biopsy. He and listed as in the top 25 top breast cancer doctors in the world and the clinic was the first in the UK to introduce digital mammography so I guess they know what they are talking about (I hope!) If he says I'm fine I will believe him. He was able to find a lump last time in my left breast that digital mammography and ultrasound did not - and he predicted that it was benign - which it was. I have taken an anithistamine tablet and the rash is fading which is a relief and I came on today and the breast feel less itchy and annoying. I'm still nervous though and will be for a while longer. In terms of the breast denisty issue the consultant radiologist said that my breasts were not too dense and that it means that you have more milk ducts and glands as opposed to fat. As you get older this should decrease and I'm not to worry about it. Women in their 40's do have dense breasts but of course I will keep an eye on it as I get older.  Any comments  / feedbaack on this would of course be appreciated. Thanks for all your support",

I have to say though I think the US has the 2 of the best best cancer centres in the world - Fox chase and MD anderson. The NHS is great too if you live in the right area of the UK and as long as you have a) a good GP and b) the persistence to get a referral if you need it. My friend works in medecine in a very large London hospital and she has primed me on where the best hospitals are. We now have the right in the UK to demand that an ambulance takes us to a certain hospital providing it does not jeapordise the person's health and it's within a certain distance. For centralish London where we live I know which one is the best for trauma or a head injury, which is best if you have a minor injury and where to take a very sick child.",

Anyway went back to other doc who haf originally suggested MRI and he says please don't worry as confident it's nothing. To draw a line under it he agrees to do punch biopsy in an area that's showing rash. The rash BTW is mainly across top of right breast and onto chest and a bit on the top of other breast. Agree could be heat / other reason but I've never had a rash on my breasts before. Now the skin where biopsy taken in red and blanches when I press down. Weirdly the redness covers the area where the rash extended to and takes the shape of it. I also mentioned density of breasts again and said are they dense. Other place says not that dense and common for women my age to have dense breasts. He says they are a grade 3 to 4 (most dense) and also says common at my age. Both his radiographer and other clinics radiographer have looked at the MRI and say all fine. Slight uptake more of dye in right breast but nothing suspicious or any lymph node problems. They looked more or less the same on each side. Finally I suffer from adenomyosis and usually have blood baths for periods. This one is light flow comparably and shorter.

Where can I find some articles on this that are reliable and can help in this? One other question - I know alcohol is an important factor in risk for any BC but how important is it for density.
