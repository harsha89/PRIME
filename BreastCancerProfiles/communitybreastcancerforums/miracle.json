(after being on Tamoxifen for almost 5 years!). My family history is extremely strong for breast cancer which is why I was on the Tamoxifen. Anyway, I have decided to do the bi-lateral mastectomy which is scheduled for 2 weeks from tomorrow (March 10th). I can't live with this worry anymore because I have 2 kids & want to be around for a long time. Has anyone else made this same choice with this diagnosis? It seems like most of you have opted for the lumectomy & radiation route. I'd appreciate your feedback. Thanks, Miracle",

I'm also very new to this whole process & actually couldn't find this thread again after my first posting!Â  Don't laugh but I'd spent about 2 days trying to find you guys again & couldn't figure it out! Ok. I'm cute but not bright! Finally, I emailed the website & just heard back from someone today who told me to go to \"my home\" & from there, I was able to see my history of comments I'd posted to which thread. Crazydaisy, you & I have been in touch on your other thread, \"Bye Bye Boobies\". I feel like you're an old friend already. Anne, thanks so much for your support. I really do feel like this is the right decision. As I've told my kids, i want to be around to nag them for a long time! Miracle",
