BS keeps telling me its very early, we're lucky we caught it at the microcalc stage, etc. He also sent me for genetic testing, got a pretty full panel ,lucky for me all the genes tested were negative for mutations, But I am still an anxiety ridden mess. Party because this is the latest of crisis I've had to endure the past several years. And also, because of the family history of cancer, known genetic mutations or not. Maternal grandmother had breast cancer and MX at 59, but lived to be 96. Maternal uncle died of pancreatic cancer in his 30's. And then there is my mother. Diagnosed with thyroid cancer in the summer 2011. Everybody told her it was treatable, until a head and neck MRI should multiple brain mets. Then she was diagnosed with lung cancer and died a few months later. It was a shock for all of us, especially how quickly she went from being active and healthy, hadn't smoked in 40 years, to dying of multiple cancers. (If I should be putting this family cancer thing somewhere else on the forum, please let me know). I think now I am being triggered because of the way things happened with my mom, even when I get good news. (I had already been diagnosed with PTSD before this breast cancer, and have been on a couple anti-anxiety meds) So my questions are: 1) does a breast MRI give any info about lymph nodes? My BS is planning on doing \"breast conserving surgery\" with sentinel node biopsy, but I'm wondering about the breast MRI here? 2) should I ask BS to order a chest x-ray? He ordered me a presurgey EKG, and blood tests (CBC,CMP), but it seemed like he didn't think I needed a chest x-ray. Should this be standard? Or again will a breast MRI show if the cancer has spread to the chest or lungs? I have been having shortness of breath and a dry cough the past few weeks (I have never smoked). My therapist, psychiatrist and I were chalking it up to anxiety (since these symptoms started after the biopsy came back positive). But after doing some research and especially reading this forum I'm not so willing to do that. Not to mention mom probably did have primary lung cancer. Should I push for a chest x-ray, and if so do it now, or wait until after results of breast MRI come back? Thanks everyone!

When I had the diagnostic mammo, the radiologist thought it would be DCIS at worst, and yet when the biopsy pathology report came back it specifically said Invasive ductal carcinoma. And the BS and I went over the pathology report together in his office after the results came back. So step one in things turning out worse than they thought. And no I never had allergies before, these breathing symptoms are brand new for me BS is the one who pulled strings to get me into the genetic counselor, and get those results back quickly. He did this because of that family history of cancer I ticked off during my first consult with him. Good to know breast MRI is the gold standard. That may be why BS didn't bother with chest x-ray, since he already had that lined up. But the main reason he wanted the breast MRI is because there is a 2nd calc cluster in the left breast. Supposedly it was on previous mammos and is listed as \"stable\" on the current mammos. But since the first one came back cancer, they want to investigate this one further before surgery. And I didn't hear anything about this 2nd one until after the first biopsies and that pathology report came back. I think the radiologist who did the biopsies reread the mammos, and when she looked at the 2nd calc cluster told BS we should investigate it further \"just to be safe\". So step two in things being worse, or at least potentially worse, that I/we thought. I do appreciate the support and will keep you updated.",

I've had anxiety issues and been taking Atavin for a while due to lots of stress in my life even before BC. And then BC, and the emotional roller coaster of tests and waiting for those results I went thru before surgery, I started having actual panic attacks. My treatment has involved the machine doing a sideways dance. I lie on my back with my left arm over my head, and it radiates my left breast from the left side. Then rotates over me and radiates the breast from my right side. The Dr told me this reduces the chance of side effects on my heart or lungs. Hope he's right.",

The radiologist who did it (she was the same one who did my first biopsies) said it did bleed more and it took the nurse longer to stop the bleeding when she was done. I am really on pins and needles because from what my BS says this will be the decision point on being able to have a lumpectomy, versus having a mastectomy. And I'm two months out from initial diagnosis, during which time I've had the Drs all saying how early we caught this but then tests going the wrong way, and I still don't have any diagnosis or treatment scheduled. I think I finally figured out what's been happening. I left a message for the social worker at the cancer center about my concerns over this dynamic, and she told me today it seems like its because I have dense breasts. And so I realized all the mammos weren't picking everything up. So when that's what the Drs were going by, it looked like it was very early cause all the mammos showed was the microcalcs. It took the breast MRI to show the fuller picture, whereas the second area which was just biopsied barely showed up on the mammos at all. Again, wish me luck.",

I went this morning for a 2nd opinion meeting with another well known cancer center in my area. I had already fedexed them copies of most of my images and radiology reports, and pathology reports from my three biopsies, as their nurse coordinator had requested. I self referred to this place just because of my round about trip so far with BC as I've already described, so just thought I'd get a 2nd set of eyes. Their opinion was that my original IDC was extremely small (2mm) and given its characteristics it would be up to me to even have a SNB. I probably still would have, but it was nice to hear My original BS and I were on track for lumpectomy and SNB after the 2nd biopsy in my left breast came back benign. And this last biopsy was because of a 9mm mass on my recent breast MRI as I posted here earlier Except, the BS at the 2nd cancer then told me this morning that when their radiologist reviewed my images from the 1st place, they saw something completely \"new\" on the same breast MRI that no one at the 1st center saw on any of my images (diagnostic 3D mammo, breast MRI, etc) I will describe what their radiology report says about the \"new\" area from the breast MRI, \"Deep to this [the 2nd biopsy in the left breast that came back benign] there is an additional area of enhancement measuring approximately 2.5cm. A targeted ultrasound of the deep left 12:00 position is suggested\" The BS at the 2nd place told me this was deeper in and closer to the chest wall than all the others. He then wanted me to get them a copy of the last mammogram I had right after the last biopsy since I didn't have that one oto give them, So I talked to their nurse coordinator this afternoon and she is going to get that from the 1st cancer place ASAP, so the radiologist at the 2nd place can review and compare to the breast MRI. I am numb. And by this point am so weak from all this stress and super anxiety I am sometimes walking with a cane. Its kinda like my security blanket.

The biopsy of right breast came back benign, but left breast was IDC. Then BS wanted an breast MRI, due to my having dense breasts and some family history of cancer. That showed another small mass, and so another biopsy which luckily was also benign. So finally had my lumpectomy and SNB this past Thursday. Mine may be an usual case, and I agree by now you should at least have an appointment with a BS scheduled.",
