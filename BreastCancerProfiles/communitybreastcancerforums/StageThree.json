RO had all last week to come up with solutions and never offered these relief pads that I keep reading about. Specifically when I told them I work full time and can\u2019t take a narcotic during the day and must have said a dozen times that I wanted topical relief. Also, my RO DOC just has his nurses deal with me. Not fond of him right now. Funny thing about the coconut oil is I feel less residue from that then the aquafor which is basically Vaseline and think it relieves better and it\u2019s natural with no other ingredients or alcohol. Aquafor has alcohol in it. Also no bra since treatment #20. I unfortunately can\u2019t use silvaderm due to an allergy. I got Silva sorb and it doesn\u2019t go on easy - rolls up into balls. I know it\u2019s up to me to get through the best way I can. Just feel so defeated and angry with RO. Thanks for prayers an well wishes. I\u2019m sending the same to you all.",

ER+/ PR+/ Her2 Neg. Finished chemo Dec. 2017. 8 treatments: 4 AC, 4 Taxol. Had nausea with AC and used marinol for relief. Taxol was easier than AC. Had trouble sleeping due to steroids and Benadryl for a few days after. Did end up losing my two big toenails. Hair is coming back slowly but happy about that. It was my second best feature next to my OG breasts. I am in the middle of rad treatments. Prescribed 31. Have 11 left. During the 4th week started having extreme pain. Couldn't sleep. Had no rad last week due to this. Skin peeling and raw. They won't allow use of lidocaine- not much of a reason was given. Prescribed a narcotic for my pain!!! Really? No topical relief... stumped. I had been using aloe gel (no alcohol) and organic cold pressed coconut oil. They told me to stop using coconut oil and I tried miaderm, no help, r1/r2 gel, no help!!! I need help. Unresponsive medical office didn't return call Friday. Suffering through the weekend. Started using coconut oil again and now triple antibiotic ointment. Afraid of infection now. Feel like I'm getting the run around. Told to do what makes me comfortable but not given any alternatives to coconut oil except products that have all kinds of crap in them including alcohol. WTH? Anyone out there quit rads? How do I get through 11 more if I'm already this miserable. Would rather do chemo. All of the people who are part of my support group said rads was a cake walk. So frustrated and confused. Appreciate any words of wisdom. Thx- StageThree, Tampa Log in to post a reply",
