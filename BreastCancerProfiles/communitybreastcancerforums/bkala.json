I thought I would get your opinions on my situation because of that. About a year ago I found a lump on my left breast between 12 and 1.  I had lymph nodes in my neck and around my right clavicle bone that had swelled at that time so I assumed it was a lymph node as well. The others went away but this lump remained. I didn't panic - I just assumed it was something going on like a virus or something. I didn't have insurance at the time either so that was a factor in not going to the doctor immediately. Now I do and I went to my gyn's office last Monday just to have them take a look. The nurse practitioner did the exam, found it immediately, said it was suspicious (not a cyst) but they would check it out thoroughly. She ordered a mammogram (first one, diagnostic - I am 39)with optional ultrasound (radiologist discretion). I went the next day and they told me I was all clear - no ultrasound. My doctor's office called and they want me to return to the office next week to let the doctor feel it and possibly do an ultrasound because nothing showed on the mammo and the nurse practitioner was a little confused as to why it didn't show at all. It is about the size of a pinky finger laying horizontally. I also have some slight swelling down the side of that breast, and a slightly swollen lymph node in the armpit area that the nurse practitioner felt. No issues with the other breast. I have a few questions for all of you. Has anyone had nothing show on their mammogram with a palpable mass? What type of questions should I ask my doctor or what should I be adamant about having done? I am not usually a person to panic but the not knowing WHAT it is is hard. And never having faced anything like this before I just don't know what I should be doing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance  Log in to post a reply",

I was just surprised that there was nothing there on mamogram. I didn't question them on my breast density but I will when I return to the next visit. I want to be prepared with as much information/questions as I can be for that visit. I am trying to focus on other dx's but of course when you find a lump in your breast the worst tends to creep into your mind.  Again, thanks for your kind words, advice, and comfort.",

The words you wrote did not make me panic but they do give me the knowledge and courage to make sure the doctors hear my concerns. I am not usually a pushy person but I will make sure they do everything to make sure I am comfortable with their diagnosis. Some of the words you wrote could have come straight from my mind. I did feel like a nuisance calling repeatedly to find out my results and if they were going to take it further. (fortunately, I didn't have to encourage them to do more - that was their own decision)Your post meant a lot and thank you so much for your thoughts and concern. I hope everyone who posts encouragement, advice, and support realizes just how much their words can mean to people. It is definitely a scary time when you don't know WHAT is going on in your own body. Thank you again.",

I remember being placed on the table then next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery! I have a 2 inch incision and really no pain to speak of. I slept most of Thursday and by Friday afternoon I felt back to myself. I kept an ice pack on for about 24 hours because I did have some swelling during that time but had no need for pain meds after Thursday. It really was not anything like I imagined it to be ahead of time :) To me shaking the effects of the anesthesia was the hardest part...oh and the waiting for pathology, ofcourse.  Good luck to you and I hope yours is as easy as mine was. ",
