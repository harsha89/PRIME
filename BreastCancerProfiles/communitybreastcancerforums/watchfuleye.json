I just did the oral rinse BRAC testing last Thursday.  The NP at my surgeon's office told me that the oral rinse renders the same results as the blood test, and they use it now as it is less invasive, and less costly than a draw. You said the Lab is telling you they need a re-test.  What did your Doctor say?  Six weeks seems like a long time.  I was told my results would be back in two weeks. I'm sorry you are having this experience.  The waiting is always the worst -- especially to find out your results were inconclusive.  What is your new Doctor advising?",

Don't know much yet, other than what appears in my siggy.  Initial visit with surg onc on Friday, and the scheduling of further tests of these dense breasts of mine to rule out (or not) any other spots/areas of concern.  I think I dread the hurry-up-and-wait part of this the most. I tried to tell God there are so many other ways to help me work on patience.  :) Oh well, wanted to introduce myself.  Love and light to those others who have just received this dx, and to those who are compassionate and open in sharing with those who have questions or just need someone to listen.

Well, it is now a week later and my youngest sister is wanting to know  \"when I'm going to tell Mom\" and not feeling comfortable in witholding information.  I am angry with myself for sharing with her now, as I really (1) don't want that pressure at this moment in time, and (2) my Mother is 77 and a BC survivor herself and I do not want to worry her needlessly until I have more information. But, I digress.  I guess I'm looking for someone who may have felt the same way as I am about not sharing this with everybody.  I am a pretty private person and I feel the same about my health issues. Am I being reasonable?  This really is bothering me tonight as I have no desire to share this outside of my DH and I. We do plan to share with our children and my other siblings at a future point, but I'm really regretting having shared with my sisters at all. I'm feeling backed in a corner and upset with myself for not keeping my mouth shut. \"Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket, save it for a rainy day.\" Dx 8/16/2011, IDC, 1cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 1/2 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

She takes everything and makes it all about her.  As a result, what one might hope to get from their mother, she is not capable of giving.  I've seen it play out over and over throughout my life, and learned to not share as a result. Grrr!  I just re-read this and realized that the dysfunction in my family is once agin rearing it's ugly head. Perhaps the reason I've lived 1000's of miles away all these years. I so wish I had not shared with my sisters, but cannot unring that bell.  I can, however, decide what I choose to share going forward.  I did email my pressuring Sister and told her that I am sorry that I  placed her in a position to lie by omission, and I would release her from this burden just as soon as I could.  I asked her once again to just hang on for a few more weeks.  I hope she will honor my request. As one of you so aptly said, \"a secret isn't a secret once you share it\". Again, thanks to everyone for sharing.  It really means alot to me.",
