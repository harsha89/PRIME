You worry when you are dam sure something is wrong, but what you are doing right now is anxiety that does you no good. I had a chest X-Ray and the report said Polumonary nodule of 0.5 cm I almost feeaked out, cried, and di all the drama in the world, but it did me no good. You need to calm down, excercise, work on mind therapy and tell yourself you are fine, nothing is wrong with you, smile, laugh instead of crying, pray, let this negative energy of thoughts out of you, and you will be in peace. Whatever it is (and I pray it will be nothing serious) we don't have anything in our hands to do, all we can do is get treatment, and pray it works well for us. Hugs coming your way",

I did have some side effect issues on the day of the infusion but was managable. The 1st day was great I thought, each person has his own experience since I did not feel anything, even my doctor was surprised it was only the 3rd day when I developed a flew like symptoms and then FEVER, it went up to 104 and they had to rush me to the ER. ever since that day till today I am feeling sick first it was flew, then fever, then mouth sores, and an UGLY taste in my mouth. I don't know how to get it away, it is preventing me from eating, and drinking and I know I have to get my energy up for the coming battle. As well I have like a stabbing pain right on my heart, it comes and goes, for a moment I thought it is a heart attack, and now a sever pain in my upper right leg. Could this relate to the chemo? So I want to ask: How do I get rid of this taste and mouth sores, I had difficulty talking because it hurts so bad. Is it true that vitamine C is not good with chemo as it reduces the power of chemo. So I can not take like boost fruit drinks! I have been told that herbs are not good woth chemo, where do I find the lost of herbs of the yes and no herbs with chemo thing? Is it OK that I use vitamine E oil for my skin or other oils to moisture my skin? How do I keep myself active and energized that is what my doc told me? but how?

In one of my chemo sessions when I was soo afraid and in the peek of my anxiety, a man was sitting next to me taking his dose, he told me that he has been diagnosed since 2002, and cancer has been visiting different sites in his body and now he is fighting it in his lungs1! He told me to stand for it, fight and never loose hope and faith. When I went back home, I asked myself, I read about chemo and how strong it is to kill the cancer cells. It does allot to our bodies, hair falls, vomiting...tired, pain..etc and above all we keep out strength and we welcome all the bad things it does just coz we know this unpleasant guest has a good job to do, its like a home made who cleans the dust and dirt. That Y we are so acceptable. So I asked myself, despite all that it does in our bodies, Y does cancer come back after a while, or after some long time? Why does it come back in a diff. place? Y does it let us rest for a while and come back again? so does that mean the chemo did not work, or is it a temp. effect. I asked my doctor and he said NO cancer can be cured. Not sure if he said that for hope or for a strong belief of his. I have a friend of mine who has been diagnosed with BC, and she came back from her treatment and her family did celebrate. I was happy for her, but a friend of mine said (Y r u happy, poor thing it is cancer, it will come back again..there is no cure that's why it is called the wicked devil).. Apologies if this post might casue frustrations to some but it does for me as well, I just want to share my thoughts, and worries and find some answers.

If you have read some of my posts I had a concern about liver mets. reason being is that in Feb 2011 when I did my radiation CT check before starting radiation the CT report said their is a cyst and an area of hegmentation or something like that (what it means is a collection of veins in one place) or something!! The doctors did not mention this to me at all, I happend to know by chance when I saw my report in one of my visits to the doctor. When I asked the dr. he said cysts are bengin and they are common moreover, he said the CT result is of no cause for concern or worry. My liver test which I did in March 2011 was normal and so were my tumor markers. Two days or so I started feeling some indigestion issues...feeling full or not feeling hungery. Although I eat well and have no neusea or vomiting or stool issues. I obesrve my stomach and all is fine, like no enlragment or big tummy thing. I have irritable bowel syndrom IBS three years or so I devloped IBS. Now I feel like there is a stuck thing in my throat, I used to have an infection and was cleared with antibiotics, the dr. told me some antibiotics cause indigestion issue... I saw my general physician last month and upon physical examination he said all is OK. I have my original appointment with the oncologist end of this month, but somehow I am worried.

I just like to take from your experience, indeed each one of us, is a different case, and a different cancer, but we all share one goal, and have one hope. 1. Have any of you had a recurrence of disease, or stageIV whilst their CA27.29 was very normal!! I know some of the onco don't use this test or rely on it. 2. Can you have liver mets, while your LFT is normal and your CA as well? 3. How accurate is a CT w/o contrast in diagnosing mets. I had a recent one for the chest, and it said I have a 0.5 cm nodular in the right lung where I had rads, and mast. it also saw two low attenuation in my liver. My onco believes it is nothing of worry or concern, the rad. onco believes there is suspicion..How!!If my blood work was OK, AND CLINICAL EXAM WAS GOOD. 4. I read in my search over the internet that liver attenuation is normal and means some fatty liver, or it could be hemangioma. 5. Have you ever had a nodule in the lung that disappeared for no reason?

I am ER+ (90%) PR+ (70%) HER2-NEU: Not overexpressed (what does that mean would any one tell me please) I was told I need to do PET scan for the body, or maybe a breast MRI to check the nipple since the doctor is concerned that my nipple would be involved.

How do I know that chemotherapy is right for me, how do I know or they know that those medications are effective? What about the PORT!! I am soooo scared of the procedure specially that I have issues with general anesthetic. Does it have to be in the neck! What do I expect during the chemo treatment, will I vomit, skin rash, heart problems, breezing problems. How long will I take it and how frequent R there any standardized medical procedure that I need to be aware of or ask about before getting my treatment Can they provide me with a nutritionist to help me with the food stuff that is good for me ..etc Will I be supervised by a doctor during the chemo session, will I stay overnight at the hospital. Who take care f me or looks after me during that time. How long a chemo session takes Finally after all those desperate questions: Is it effective to shrink the tumor size? How fast or how effective before surgery. I am afraid that I am stage 3 -not sure if it gone somewhere else.
