I called my fiance in the bathroom to see if he felt the same things, he did. The next day I called my Pcp doctor for an appointment. When the examined my breast she seemed a bit worried and said she was going g to send me to get an US. When I got there soon as they looked at me (I look super young) they made my diagnostic right there.... When she took the US she didn't touch my breast at all she just asked me where did I feel the lump and puts mark SMH they said I THINK you me have extra tissue. I'll see u when u turn 40. Now my doctor wants my other breast examined. so waiting for my appointment on Thursday what should I do? I know my body and it don't feel right my breast hurt so bad that I can't sleep.my nipple is changing and ariola is way bigger now and swollen and I've had discharge the lump it huge",
