I understand the increased risk now with the multi-focal lesions and LCIS makes that a prudent choice - but my question is around the SNB process. Previous mammos and MRI showed nothing in the left side (the \"good\" side); so how can the SNB process \"find\" a sentinel node?  Seeking feedback - for those of you who have done PBM - what has been your experience? Did you have the SNB done on both sides?  Thank you! Bonnie Dx 12/31/2008, IDC, 1cm, Grade 2, 3/10 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The drain is used to draw fluid away from the surgical site when multiple nodes are removed. My understanding is that not all lumpectomies need a drain; it depends on the particulars of your situation.  If you do get a drain, make sure the nurses explain how to strip and empty it before you leave the hospital.  Best of luck to you!
