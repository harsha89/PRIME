After the appointment my doctor had sent me to get an ultrasound a few days later (I cried like a baby the whole time) I was supposed to get the results the next day but then I realized it was the weekend and they obviously don't work on the weekends, and by Monday they STILL didn't have the results. Tuesday morning came along and my dad told me they called back. The lumps are benign :) I have to get ultrasounds yearly now, and always check for changes. My whole look on life has changed now that the worry is gone and I'm in good hands. In the time being I turned 16 and now I feel like I can start living. Thank you to all who cared, and hope you are doing well. :)))) Log in to post a reply",

They've grown as I've grown, but don't seem to protrude in a strange way. Just by looking at my breasts you will not be able to tell I have them, although they take up almost my whole breast. You can't even feel them by feeling the front, only by squeezing the side. When I was 10 I had my dad call the doctor and he said that is was hormonal, considering my age. Although its been 5 years or more and I'm just really scared. My mom died from breast cancer at age 48. I do know the chances are slim, but I read of a 13 year old girl having breast cancer and it worries me to death. I'm going to tell the doctor about it again at my next check up, but I'd just like some reassurance about what I might hear from him. Thank you Log in to post a reply",
