Thursday.  Sure wish I would have known all this, would probably have had total mastectomy on both sides and be done with it, which is what I WANTED to do anyway.  I am 70, was diagnosed with breast cancer in January, had Partial Mastectomy and more surger to remove larger margin (cancer NOT in Lymph nodes tho) and then was candidate for NEW SAVI radiation implant (5 days-2 treatments a day and you're DONE), which was finished a few weeks ago.  Just started having this SEARING BURNING feeling from under my arms to my back a few days ago, had the \"stringing\" almost right away after surgery and more after radiation.  When this SEARING BURNING sensation hits, I SCREAM, cannot  keep from it.   Will keep you posted on what the dr. says, but I want to go to a Neurologist for SURE.  I have good health ins. so can go where I need to as long as dr. is Medicare Provider. ",
