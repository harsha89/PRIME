I am 59. y.o., small very active, healty, green and organic lifestyle for over 33. Non-smoker. Never missed a screening mammo in 25 years. Diagnosed with TNBC small tumor Stage 1-2 in March 2018. Apparently I carry the BRCA1 gene mutation and is the first person in my family in 3 generations to ever develop BC. Let me state my Paternal side of the family has had Prostate and Ovarian cancers. I have told Docs this for the past 20 plus years. Everyone Poo Pooed me and said not to worry since my Mom and older sisters and Aunts had no Breast Cancer. Well, guess who was right? They finally tested me after the diagnosis. That's how I found out about the mutation. Hence my journey begins. I adored my Oncologist and I have so blessed. Had Neoadjuvunct (sp?) first - 16 weeks of chemo then BMX on 8/23 with immediate tissue expander reconstrcution. FIRST LET ME SHOUT IT OUT THAT MY CHEMOTHERAPY TOTALLY ERRADICATED MY TUMOR BEFORE THE SURGERY! I believe in my heart this is God's hand, and a great gift of guidance from my docs. I was not and still am not one with a frame a mind that deals well with this experience. Not sure anyone ever does. Got wonderful news after surgery, No Cancer Anywhere, not in either breast or any lymphnodes. Praise God! I feel that I am over the hump and can finally begin to heal......BS did BMX, plastic surgeon started the TE reconstruction. Two weeks out, extreme pain which I expected, especially since I can't take narcotics, I notice this weird looking patch of yellow/brownish \"stain\" off to the side of one of the incisions. Funny, it was on the prophylatic breast removal side. The original BC breast incision was healing beautifully. I knew this was weird and felt it just wasn't right. Also extreme pain in that one area and not on the other breast. Went in to have my first fill of 100cc's with PA, PS was out of town and he approved this. She saw the area and said \"Oh looks like a small blister which will be absorbed by the skin.\" She filled each TE with 100 ccs. I was a large busted small girl (36G-H). I also found out at the time the PS filled my TE with 360cc's during surgery since I had existing pockets (submusclural) from a breast lift I had 14 years earlier. This seemed a bit much to fill, but I didn't know beforehand and he felt there was enough room for me to handle it. He said pockets were in good shape, did a bit of \"updating\" I guess and filled them. NOW 18 days post-op I wind up in ER room under a Plastics REsidency who confirms my suspicion of necrosis! I just knew something was wrong. They said there was no infection, but small area of tissue was dying and sent me home with an RX for Silvadene cream, 2x day application to area, cover with gause and keep the surgical bra on. Of course, I am overanxious and freaking out. MY QUESTIONS: Will the Silvadene cream really be enough to fix this? How long does it usually take? I don't understand why they won't give me oral antibiotics to prevent infection. I get it. Overuse of antibiotics are not good. He did give me an RX but said only to start if I see seepage and redness around the area of the incision. Thank God, none of that yet. But how do I know what's going on below the skin? Do I really need to wait for an infection to possible start. Is the sulpha antibiotic topical enough in the Silvadene to \"slough off\" the dead skin? I am so terrified. Have we all not gone through such hell already to only come to deal with this? I know there really are no answer to my last question. I have follow-up appts today with Plastics and again on Friday, when my doc is back in town. I am so scared because there is so much pain in that area where the skin necrosis has started. Although they tell me it \"appears\" to be only on the surface since there is no wound opening, oozing, or spreading, etc. I still wonder how they know what's going on underneath. Thank you to anyone who reads this long, long post. I truly appreciate it. Ladies, I am so scared. I am so scared. Thank you again, love and support and prayers to all for what you have all gone through. Emotionally, mentally and physically I'm a wreck. I Know the worse case scenario. I just want to hear some stories of hope and success. I don't want to lose my reconstruction, but I will pull them if I have to. Life is more important to me. Thank you again, God Bless....     ",
