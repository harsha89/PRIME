Just got off the phone with the general surgeon and he was a giant a hole!  Told me I worry to much, and that I am too young for cancer.  He said he makes the decsions he can based on his professional experience and that sometimes he is right and sometimes he is wrong!!!!!  REALLY?  Just sick of not being listened to.",
