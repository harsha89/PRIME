I didn't want the Ativan- not sure why now-at the time thought I would lose all control and wanted to be awake during the treatment. Then, I had to go to the bathroom. At one point, the PA and 2 nurses were in the BR WITH me- looking back on it now, it had to have been a little funny. My DH and DS were there as well and, I was back in the room, flapping in the bed and refusing the Ativan- it was given anyway, as I really needed it. DH finally got in the bed with me- and, I fell asleep w muscle twitching but the flapping ended. :) At apt with MO a week later, he explained that some people have that type of reaction- it is dose related. My chart was noted and they went to 1/2 dose after that. I still had some small muscle twitching with that but it was manageable. At the last treatment, the nurse missed the note in chart abt reduced dose...here we go again. So, after all of that- I just have a mental issue along w the physical one w IV Benedryl.",

I HATED it and how it made me feel...thought I was going to die or something.  Literally had a panic attack during the first chemo treatment due to uncontrollable twitching and shaking caused by the IV Benedryl. They gave me IV Ativan once they were pretty sure the reaction was from the Benedryl and not the chemo and I was \"lights out\" for about 2 hours. Thank goodness my Onc decided it was dose related and cut my dose in 1/2 from there on out. Ugh...I've been itching all over and it's driving me crazy- think it's the Herceptin treatments. Finally took a Benedryl tab yesterday-was scared it might make me weird but it didn't and helped the itching. However I took a 2 hour nap and felt out of it after that. But, today am itching again- have too much to do to nap so not taking the tab. Does anyone know if you build up a tolerance to Benedryl so it doesn't make you so drowsy? Just trying to figure out if it's worth it to keep taking it if so?",

Sandy will be attending a song writer's conference at Montreat, NC that weekend and will join us Sunday afternoon-Monday. I will be organizing all of this and we will try get together as many BC.org gals as possible to meet face to face and have time together. We will get a group room rate if we have enough folks so please look at your calendars and let's make a plan. Would just love to meet you all and have time together! Very exciting to think of having time with some of you face to face and for such a great cause. Currently, some BC.org folk are planning on arriving in Hickory on Saturday, May 21. We are planning on dinner at Highland Avenue Restaurant- award-winning (Sothern Living, Garden and Gun, etc) chef, Kyle McKnight's style is southern and delightful so I think you would enjoy! Also, so much to do in the Hickory area- shopping, hiking, etc. Once we know how many are planning to gather we will make more specific plans. Let me know if you can join us!",

It seems that many people with sensitive skin do not have and SE's or as many from rads as those who do not have sensitive skin. Think it is just so individualizes. Expect no SE's- you are going to do great. If you do have some SE's you are in the right place for help! BTW: Did you get much snow your way?

HOWEVER< it gets better soon once treatment is completely over. I really think the benedryl cream and by mouth helped BUT those dang cabbage leaves really DID help pain, itching and the heat in the breast. No kidding! I (try not to visualize this) would put a cooled cabbage leaf on the area and lie on my bed with the ceiling fan going until the heat went out of the breast tissue. Would get a fresh cool cabbage leaf and put it on to sit in den and watch tv....you can actually feel the heat in the cabbage leaf when you remove it. There is a chemical reaction that occurs. Just my 2 cents worth. Sending healing vibes and hugs to each of you as you continue through this!",

I like to keep taco soup, white chicken chili and homemade spaghetti sauce in the freezer....for those crazy weeks, for friends in need or...for now with rads coming up. These are things I can just add a salad to- or make baked ziti and taco salad to change things up with leftovers. The allrecipes site is good as well as Pinterest for all things crock pot and/or freezer ready. I also usually have a meatloaf and mac and cheese in the freezer as well. Made a white bean/ham soup last week that was delicious. Got a ham bone (or 5) from Honey Baked Ham shop in our town...used one for the soup. Keep the ham bones in the freezer....there is usually a good bit of meat on them, they are less than 5.00 apiece and they don't have to be thawed if you are using them in a soup or stew. Hope all goes well for you!",

They gave me a list at the RO and it says the aloe vera should be 97% aloe vera. Can't seem to find anything at CVS or Walgreens that indicates 97% or higher. 2. Have any of you had stomach issues as a result of rads? Asking since I've had an upset stomach after both sessions.. Of course, it cold be nerves as that whole rad things freaks me out and I have been white knuckled both times. Thanks in advance for any advice.",

Feel like it is my good luck to try to get the 5 off before starting the Estrogen blocker. My MO had indicated I would start the oral meds day after rads ended. The RO said we would probably need to wait a week or two after rads ends to let me skin heal. He assured me a week or two would not make a difference. Am hoping not- still on Herceptin until end of May. SO weird based on reports of others because, rads has been the hardest thing yet....emotionally and physically. AM SO over it. Hoping the boosts do not BOOST the bad places on my breast. Will be interested to see on Monday. Interested...not excited. Ok, so just realized that as happy as I am about hair growing back in- realized tonight that on the top of my head- the right side is growing up and to the left of center and the left side is growing up and to the right of center....beginning to see the beginnings of the \"electrocuted chia pet\" haircut.

Neuropathy is awful- hopefully, you will recover fully from it.  Falling is scary! The weight loss and 5ks are awesome, though. Good for you!  Suz-Q- Glad to see you!  I did the same thing with Arimidex..had a lot of issues so went off of it for 6 weeks- tried something else- can't remember name of it right now but it was worse.  After a break fro that- went back on the Teva Arimidex generic and doing fine.  Have heard others say taking a break helped them as well.

Glad is sounds like Neulasta has been approved. (I called it NeuBLASTA the whole time getting it since it's supposed to blast up the count :) Anyway, took injection in arm first 4 times but it hurt sooo, tried having it done in stomach last 2 times....so much more comfortable IMO. Just wanted to suggest that if you haven't tried it. Sounds terrible but was good- wish I had been brave enough to try it earlier. Take good care!",

To answer your questions: 1. -I was post menopausal as I had ovaries removed in 32013 due to constant issues with ovarian cysts. 2. just turning 56 at dx 3. I always had think hair with a lot of body- it had thinned some but was still straight and pretty thick prior to dx. 4. I was mousy brown/dishwater blonde with a bit past shoulder length prior to dx....wore it pulled back often as it was easier.  Lost hair completely day 18 after first treatment.  It started coming back in several weeks after last treatment but sloooowwwwly.  However, I was still getting Herceptin.  Anyway, it did come back in very curly and silvery white initially- it took a long time to fill in- and stayed curly for over a year...currently, I have a short bob, lots of body, gray/brown, it is much thinner but still good coverage except thinner in one area above forehead- I can deal with that with a side part....I use some hair products like mousse or sprays to add a bit of lift.     ",
