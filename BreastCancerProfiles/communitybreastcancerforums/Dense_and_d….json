Before I put my story out there, I have to say that I feel for all of you with this \"Oh, it isn't cancer BUT it needs to come out immediately AND your risk for bc has now doubled and you will be closely followed up every 3-6 months and maybe you should take Tamoxifen but really, don't worry about it.\" I have had cancer. I know how it can change your world. It is horrid and frightening (to say the least.) My heart goes out to anyone/everyone who has a cancer diagnosis, now or in the past. I'm here, 32 years later and you can be too (unless you're an AARP member ... you may not live to age 100! There is nothing like group support so thanks to the women who have put this together and who manage this little corner of the world. Okie dokie.... here goes. I'm now 60. At the end of 2017, I had a callback that turned into a CNB after mammo. It found complex lesion/radial scar. CNB was non-malignant yet found ADH, ALH, FEA, papilloma. FYI, this showed up on mammogram but was non-palpable and didn't show up on U/S. I had an excision and it also didn't show malignancy. Still, ADH, ALH, FEA and several other acronyms. I also had 8 lymph nodes removed. (? on that one - I believe that they reallly thought that I had cancer.) FYI, I had some serious cording that started the week after an uneventful surgery. Thank god for physical therapists! That has resolved. I have a great surgeon and have seen a Plastic Surgeon, if needed. This has scared the pants off of me, in large part because there are so many unknowns. I'm sorry but when I read that, going backwards, IDC comes after DCIS which comes after ADH (and ADH, depending on how it is read, sometimes is DCIS.) Going forward though, \"Very few people with ADH get cancer.\" Ok, then why the hawk-eye survellience?  From reading the other posts from people with these \"special\" benign breast conditions, I see that many of you have been left hanging too with a lot of fear, a lot of questions. If anyone has come up with a good way to handle this twilight zone, please share! I had lymphoma when I was young, no radiation, multi-agent chemo. I have UCTD (Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disorder) because of Antiphospholipid Antibodies and some clot problems when I had lymphoma. I am on Plaquenil and baby aspirin for that. I've had 3 mo. Mammo. and will have 6 mo MRI this week. What a shock when my sister (65) was diagnosed a few weeks ago with IDC, stage IIB and will have radiation after lumpectomy then 5-10 yrs of an AI. She has an excellent prognosis. We both had mammograms a year prior to our new findings. We both have extremely dense breasts. I'm thinking that hers just wasn't seen last year. When I looked at my previous mammogram report, there was something possibly seen on the same slice (3D.) I had a call-back and ultrasound didn't show anything. My bc risk is now: 5 yr: 6%, Lifetime: 26.1% so I am now officially at a high risk for bc.  I can't take Tamoxifen for two reasons; The first is because of my clotting history. The second is because I'm on Plaquenil. Zikes but fairly new research has shown that an extremely small chance of blindness (retinal neuropathy) with Plaquenil is increased, I think 5-fold. (Freaky!) If I were to get bc (obviously, a huge fear for all of us), radiation could be a problem because of my connective tissue/autoimmune disorder. Aromatase Inhibitors would also not be in my cards. I'm stuck. And scared. On the plus side, I know a lot more about how well bc can be treated. My sister's dx hurts my heart yet I feel that she will be ok. My very stressed mind now says \"IF I ever get bc, my treatment options are severely limited.\" Lol, I'm a very logical person. Perhaps that is getting the better of me? I know that having a mastectomy (a couple of them) will be rough with a recovery that is painful, takes a lot of time and a lot of work. I know people who have had them and, thankfully, they are happy and healthy. I am very much leaning in that direction. If my insurance won't pay for it, I'll use the medical financing. (I am now officially high risk so there is a chance.) I am waiting for my MRI then the Dr. visit next week. I will get a 2nd opinion and possibly a 3rd. I have typed out a post here about 5 times. I am having some \"survivor's guilt.\" I've read many posts all throughout this forum. My best thoughts, wishes and prayers are with all of you. I'm hoping for some clarity. (Yes, I will click \"Submit\" this time.) Sorry for the very complicated post. You are all dealing with your own diagnoses so thanks for reading about mine. Does anything pop out at you? Am I missing something? Am I overreacting by thinking that having prophylactic surgery will give me the best chance (not 100%) of not developing bc. ",

How great that you're recovering well. It hasn't even been a month! Here's to your expansion going well. Because of my previous cancer, I started having mammograms at age 35. Last Dec. was my first biopsy. (I have had some cysts aspirated.) I've almost always had callbacks due to fibrocystic breasts. So, lets see, I've been doing this for 25 years now. As you all know, the call-backs hit the old Anxiety button. At least now it doesn't take a week to get results. Once you get your implants and heal, will your followup exams be palpating by a Dr. Any regularly scheduled MRIs? Cheers  ",
