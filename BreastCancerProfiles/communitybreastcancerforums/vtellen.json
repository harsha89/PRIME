Asked for zofran, but was told by my chemo nurse that a zofran type drug would be in my drip and it would last 3-5 days. Then, I can take compazine- she said 9 out of 10 people are good w/ this. Oh, I also have ativan to go w/. Do you all have zofran? Is the nausea an issue? Please advise!!!",

It was done on women over 65 who were not having chemo. And it showed a 19% decrease in recurrence w/ women who did not delay rads after lumpectomy. So, obviously none of us fit in that group, but it still makes me realize that the rads are an important part of the treatment.... Deb in Utah- I was told that fatigue increases towards the end of the radiation. Weeks 4-6 or so. I totally understand your jealousy :) I promise to be brief in my whooping it up after I am done posts! Robyn- my chemo NP said fatigue is cumulative, but nothing else. Who knows what to believe?! Ha! Kasi- You always have such good info! I didn't know about the hyperpigmentation! But, I can for sure see it. I was wondering. I have a ton of freckles and moles. I go to dermotologist yearly and my appt came up this week. I cancelled it because- first, they can't actually remove anything right now. Second, I can't bear the thought of another doc appt. I have enough going on... And, yeah. I feel as though no matter how long I spend on my apperance, it just ain't gonna cut it! My eyes are looking so red and teary right now for one thing. I went to the co-op this am. I hate going there because I always see people I know. This morning, 2 people told me enthusiastically \" you look good!\" They mean well, but it was all I could do to not say \" Oh, yeah rigghhttt!\" or some other sarcastic come back.

On the constipation front, I would have been fine if I had been taking the correct amt. of the senekot. Didn't read the label, and only was taking one 2xday. So, I recommend starting that stuff the evening of chemo, and carrying on for a few days or at least until... I just finished a good book about a laughing class- \"The Man who Died Laughing\" by Tarquin Hall. I love yoga, but laughing yoga, not sure about! Also, I have not been given any of these scans you guys are getting. We addressed cardio issues, and onco said taxotere wasn't cardio- bad. Also, I was told w/ a 1.4cm lump and a 2.2mm SN mass, that scans were not necessary. hope I'm getting what I need? Shoot.",

And I know, I'm worried that the 4th dose will really bring it on. And what is up with the delayed reaction, I wonder. Tell me what your doc says about it, I was just thinking about picking up some Benedryl to have on hand for next dose. I had only 1 bad night of heartburn. Tums seemed to help. And Ativan, which I am clearly an addict of now..... is that possible? Michelle- I went into my 3rd treatment w/ a partially healed mouth sore, and thought it would really act up, but actually I had no sores at all this go round! So strange how w/ each dose different SEs act up.",

I asked about CT and Pet scans and he said he would only do those for very high risk people? Ugh. My feeling is, and I hate to even put it into words, but he seems focused on my lungs. If it's going somewhere, I think that is where he thinks it will be. But, hopefully I'm just reading too much into everything. I do that a lot. Oh, I see breast surgeon after RADs, but why?

I hope that you are mending well, what a horrible experience you both went through! DebinUtah and Robyn- I have had 5 RADs so far. I am doing my treatments in Rutland,which is about a 35 minute drive 1 way from my house. The town where I am in the process of reopening my shop is fortunately between my home and the hospital. So, I guess what I am trying to say is the logistics of getting oneself to the treatments daily is more significant than the actual treatment. For my simulation/ set up appt, I laid down on what looked to be a blue bean bag of sorts. At some point one of the nurses let the air out of the bag so that it hardened in the shape of my back. I held my arms above my head while they tatooed tiny dots at the edge of my breast and did a CAT scan. My arms started to fall asleep, but the nurses were efficient and finished before I became too uncomfortable. So, now when I go in for my treatments, my blue shape is there on the table. I assume \" the position\", arms clasped at the wrist above my head. I have about 15 secs of zapping on one side, and 10 secs on the other. I was having issues w/ the having to stay still part, but think that I have talked myself down. I am feeling alittle hot on my breast. That is it!  The Rad room is surprisingly cuter than I expected. Little star-like lites all over the ceiling. Pretty wall of white light as you walk into the room. Oh, I close my eyes as soon as I lie down on the table and try to breathe calmly.",

Robyn, I am being treated by Dr.Nunnick. He and his partner travel down from Colchester to Middlebury. It is a modest little office in a trailor type building behind Porter Hospital. I have mixed feelings about the place. I like my doctor, and I know soooo many women that he has treated. But, I suspect that he is \"burned out\". He's good because he says what he thinks and he listens well. But, comments like \" it's going to be hard for you. You have great curly hair, and you're going to lose it. You won't like that. And you are going to get increasingly fatiqued. Very fatigued, and that will be hard for you, because you have so much energy\" Maybe, I could use less honesty, I don't know. I guess that he is telling it like it is, but sometimes I find him discouraging.....Sorry, the housebound neutropenic one (me) is taking to babbling on. oh oh.......",

Lumpectomies and radiation go hand in hand, and according to my RO, the number of treatments is determined by the margins. So, it is anywhere from 5-7 weeks. I am 31 treatments, even though I was told that I had good margins. What surprises me is that woman w/ mascetomies still get radiation sometimes, I think?",

When I got to the office they  took my vital signs. My blood pressure was through the roof. A  bit nervous? YEA! Then, head chemo nurse came in, any last minute questions time, and she leads me down to the room. Lots of older people in there. Actually I shouldn't say lots, as there are 5-6 chairs. However, there was also a woman in there that I knew- she was on her 3rd dose of my same stuff-TCX4. I am assuming that they don't pay this woman to come in and settle down the very nervous patients-  She had no SEs, hasn't missed a meal, no problem taking care of her kids, RUNS 5 MILES a day?!, Was walking herself home after her  dose yesterday. And the good part is she readily admitted to being a negative thinker, cup's 1/2 empty, terrified of the chemo,etc! a kindred spirit! She was perky and smiling and chatty!  sooo encouraging. The procedure is nothing- the IV was such a tiny prick, I was surprised that it was in already. First, the saline for alittle while, then Zantac, then prilosec(?) or something like that for the stomach. Then benedryl. At this point, she had brought out my Taxotere and Cytoxan bags. They were set down on my chair rest. Hmnn. I eyed them. Then awhile later, I started to think I felt queasy and nervous, going to have to barf scene coming on. Nurse promptly gave me a atavin to melt under my tongue and turned my saline drip back on. So, either that or the new steroid drip that she had hooked up as well, really perked me back up. No worries, now. Next, she hooked up the cytoxan. I felt nothing at all. Completely fine. Then came the Taxotere. Something like 1% of the population can get a reaction to this stuff, so the oxygen tank is brought over, and she hangs out in the room w/ you for the first 15 mins. Because of this reaction, she starts the drip veeerrry slowly. I worked at staying relaxed and not overreacting to every body twinge. Other patients came in and got their little weekly doses. Everyone had high praise for the clinic ( more reassurance) One guy had quite a beer belly on him, he kept asking for some vodka, or if not vodka, then beer in his drip. The nurses didn't laugh their heads off at this, I bet they hear it weekly from him. My fiance spent the 15 mins answering the nurses questions about her cat issues ( he's a vet ) So, after a good 15 mins she declared me nonreactive and turned up the drip. When the taxotere was empty it was time to go! So, we got there at 1:20, out by 5:00 or a little before. So, it is easy! I did not feel anything burning down my veins! Came home, had dinner (Tarragon chicken on pasta w/ fresh wax beans and salad) Took a 20 minute walk w/ Scott and the dogs. Then to bed! Is anyone still reading this monologue? Most importantly, I still feel like ME. Even better because I have some help on board to kill the evil invaders!          Thanks for listening to my ramble, Ellen",

Madis- ativan is for anxiety, nausea, sleeping. If all you have is compazine, you might want to be asking for it. That or zofran. Someone ( can't remember who ) on here has Emend, which sounds even better. But, compazine barely cut the mustard. Ativan really helps w/ nausea, and in my humble opinion, needs to go along w/ the compazine. I am hoping that zofran alone will work for me, as I seem to have the \"restless\" side effect from the ativan. It keeps me awake at night, and I was grinding my teeth. But, who knows? The restlessness coincided w/ my hair starting to go, so maybe I was awake because of that? Claritin is the one that you want. My onco nurse admitted that there is a trial study going on now. The claritin seems to help w/ the neulesta pain.",

Someone else posting on here is taking something. I was getting close to it a couple of weeks ago, myself. I think the ativan is sedating, and that can make you feel \"down\" as well.

I am feeling fatigued this week, taking a day off today. I am in bed by 7:30, but functioning OK throughout the day! If I have any advice to give it is: As soon as you start to feel burned/burnt?(for me at @ 8 txs) ask for ointment, if they haven't already given you some. And keep your head in a good space, accepting that the radiation is GOOD for you, not harmful. That's a toughy.

But, it was an excruciatingly long scary morning. Will you get a call or go in for an appt? I wanted to be home in my own environment when I got the news...

But, for the most part, for the last few days, I feel like myregular self - most of the time. So, I was wondering if we could do some posts of what we consider our successes in this crazy chemo trip. Like for instance, when my mouthwas at its worst - numb lips, metallic taste, rough feeling all over inside - I found that LOTS of ice helped me to keep drinking. I would fill a glass w/ ice, pour in some grape juice, squit some lemon on it, and fill it up the rest of the way w/ water. This saved me. Seems like a little thing, now that I think of it, but I have very fond feelings towards ice now! I would also say that for me getting out and walking is key. Every day.",

Please, do keep posting- you always tell it like it is. And I think that you are a hoot! Madismommy- good to read your posts again. Adorable pic of you and your extremely cutestuffs daughter!",

I never could bring myself to shave it, but it has gotten super thin in sad wisps, so I am bound to have an uneven thing going on when the new stuff comes in.I'm thinking that I will even it up when I see enough hair coming in? Nothing so far, but I'm not even 3 weeks out-which is when I was told hair would begin to grow! So, starting RADs and re-opening my store at the same time! Do I know how to have fun or what?  But, this beautiful space opened up ( a little river actually runs under the store! I will have the sound of running water filling the shop - like a built in fountain!) And, here I go. I am glad that I had my chemo time off. But, I am ready to get back in the saddle! Tomorrow is mapping/simulation and whatever else they throw at me day! Dfiance has been ill for the past 2 days:( I think this has all been stressful for him, too. And now that I am functioning, he let down his guard maybe, because he is NEVER sick . Of course, I am hoping like crazy that I don't get it! No delays in treatment, please. If all goes well, I will be fini by the middle of Dec.",

It isn't diagnostic, just to help rad doc get his bearings. At least that is my understanding of it. They are also taking xrays (everytime? sometimes?) during the beaming session to double check that they are hitting where they want to. To be honest, I haven't asked as many questions w/ rads as I did w/ the chemo. I figure that there is a lot of math type stuff involved and I think that my RAD doc is competent, so..... I'm just doing what they tell me to do: stay still. So far, as I said the biggest challenge is not tensing up while I am staying still. I hear the beam come on and my insticts tell me to move away from it?!  ",

Your onco will give you your treatment options at your appt on weds. For me, this was about an hour long appt , and he showed me charts w/ recurrance/ survival rates based on the different treatments. There is something called an Onco type test, which I think you would qualify for, since you are node negative. It can help you make the decision to do chemo or not. I had a lumpectumy, so radiation is mandatory for me. You may get off w/ just hormone therapy? It is a very good idea to bring your husband w/ you to your onco appt. Also, write down all of your questions, bring a pen along to jot down answers. You are grade 3 , as am I. This means that your tumor was dividing more rapidly, and they are considered, therefore to be more aggressive. So, maybe, that will sway your decision to do chemo or not? Best wishes for you, you will find this site to be chock full of ladies w/ a lot of knowledge!  ((HUGS))",
