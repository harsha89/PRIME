Here is the thing: calcifications can either be NOTHING or they can be something. Sometimes it is hard for the radiologist to tell by looking at the mammogram. Now, pretend you are the radiologist: you are sitting looking at the mammogram; you don't THINK it's cancer, but you can't be 100% sure. It might be just pre-cancer, or it might be nothing at all (benign means NOT cancer). Do you want to be the person that didn't catch it early enough to just pick it out and be done with it (no chemo, no radiation, etc)? Or do you want catch it early? Better to just do a biopsy and look at it under a microscope. Doctors and hospitals are very, very careful nowadays and sometimes they might do biopsies when they really didn't need to; however, it is better than missing very very early stage cancer. Look at it this way: you as the patient could decide to not do this, and just wait 6 months and do another mammogram (I would do the biopsy; I'm just saying, you are in charge of your body, no one else; just because a doctor says he wants to do something doesn't mean you have to do it). They do NOT see cancer right now, or they would tell you that. Really, they just want to get a better look at what they see, and so they want to stick a needle in and pull some of the calcifications out. If you want to know more about the procedure, I can explain it (I have had SIX biopsies; the first one was the hardest cuz it was new. Now I would be like ho hum yawn ok let's go and I'd plan a shopping list while they were doing it).",

I put this on another thread, but basically the hardest part (in a weird way) for me was that nothing gets told to you all at once (Like: \"you have DCIS we are going to do X,Y,Z, and then you will go on with your life\"); instead, you get everything in bits and pieces and you have to wait in between to find out what is next. So I found HUGE projects to do around my house to keep my mind off of everything: I painted an accent wall in my living room and bedroom (go to Home Depot, pick out colors and brushes and rollers and drop cloths, and do the entire prep and paint job myself); pull out a 20 year old dead rosebush that broke a shovel and slashed my arms up and down; planted beautiful bougainvillea where the old dead rosebush used to be. There is going to be a lot of waiting and wondering; as much as you can, fill that time with DOING things to keep yourself OUT of your head. And most importantly remember this: Breast cancer IN your breast doesn't kill you; DCIS hasn't even left the milk duct, much less your breast. It is still awful and scary and life changing, but good for you for being on top of your health and catching it early. You will get through this! ps if you like, add more information to your signature line (you can do this on your profile page) so that we know what other surgeries or treatment you've had (look at my signature line). You mentioned in you original post that you were having a \"follow up\" mammogram -- follow up from what? If you add that to your signature line we will know. :)",

I'll just jump in here, but tell me if we should move to private message or if there is a forum for skin cancers that you know of. I just got diagnosed with my first one, micronodular BCC (classified as infiltrating), right over my collar bone. It is literally sitting on my collar bone so it is also near lymph nodes. I have to have surgery because the shave biopsy didn't get it all; path report says: \"extending to deep and peripheral biopsy edges.\" The doctor at Kaiser wants to do an electrodessication and curettage, but from what I've been reading micronodular is high risk for recurrence and also re-excision, and jesus it is on top of my collar bone, so wouldn't Mohs surgery be better? Per the article the mods posted above, my BARD 1 gene mutation makes me higher risk for more of these, too. I don't think this dermatologist is trained in Mohs, which is why I don't think she suggested it. There is another doctor at Kaiser who is Harvard trained in Mohs, but I'm just wondering how far I should go in fighting for the Mohs. Also, the reason I was seeing the dermatologist is because I've had a \"rash\" (for lack of a better word) along my MX scar. There is a red hive-like thing on my right MX scar that has been constant, and then there is a rough patch of skin next to my scar that hurts when touched. This morning that rough patch has turned red with two tiny papules (but honestly it changes a lot, just in general the skin is angry). Everyone has looked at this: the PA in the bs office, an oncologist, and the dermatologist, and no one thinks it is anything (dermatologist said \"I don't know; try this anti-inflammatory oil\" -- made it worse). I want to demand imaging before they do the skin cancer surgery -- like a chest MRI to include the shoulder/clavicle region, or should I ask for a CT? SOMETHING is going on with the skin on my chest, and I don't feel like we've gotten to the bottom of it yet even with this BCC diagnosis. I emailed my derma and asked her if she thought the scar issue and the BCC were connected, and she said no. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I'm ALSO dealing with a terrible degeneration in my low back and I'm in a lot of pain. So I will definitely get on top of the back diagnosis and treatment plan before I do the surgery. My dermatologist said the surgery (that she wanted) could be any time in the next three months. I believe even though infiltrating, the BCC is still slow growing, hence the wait is okay. I really liked the MO I saw at Kaiser, and she is the one who referred me to dermatology. Maybe I will email her and ask her for the imaging. I mean, it isn't unreasonable to do imaging of my chest I think when there is so much going on and we still don't know what's going on with my MX scar situation. My prior providers are all part of another insurance network and I can't see them or be referred by them. Good point on the MRI vs. CT; I don't want the contrast in the MRI either (I have some kidney damage) so I hope they can see what they need to see without the contrast. They haven't biopsied the rash because they all think it doesn't look like cancer and they want to watch it. Interestingly, the derma didn't think the mole was cancer. I told her that it bleeds off and on, and she said she didn't think it was anything, \"but do you want me to take it off if it's bothering you?\" She gave me the option! I'm afraid of infection, so I didn't want to do something just for my convenience, but I said \"If you take it, will you send it to pathology?\" and she said yes if they take it they always do. I thought might as well, so I said \"Okay then take it.\" My decision!! She takes it off, puts it in the preservative, and says \"Oh there's a little blood vessel underneath it; that's why it was pink. I really don't think this is anything.\" So twice she said it was nothing. I was in the ER on Thursday with excruciating leg pain from my back, being treated terribly btw, and I get an email from the derma where she copy/pasted the paragraph from the path report in block letters: BASAL CELL CARCINOMA, MICRONODULAR TYPE, EXTENDING TO DEEP AND PERIPHERAL BIOPSY EDGES. Now, like most bco sisters, I'm a tough broad and I usually prefer just getting a written report rather than someone spoon feeding me information. But I was in so much pain at that moment and so much has happened lately, and seeing no clean margins and knowing instantly what that meant, I just burst out sobbing. Most of that was because I was shocked. The reason I do so much research and ask so many questions is because I HATE being shocked. I want to be prepared. And she told me twice it didn't look like anything abnormal. So I was shocked. Other than venting, I guess my point is that I don't really trust anyone so far who has looked at my MX scar and said \"I don't think that's cancer,\" since the dermatologist didn't even think the mole was cancer -- and if I hadn't told her to take it off she wouldn't have. I will definitely demand MOHS surgery. Definitely. I am also going to work on getting different insurance so that I can be seen at the NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center near me. At this point, I need to be followed at a cancer center so that a multi-disciplinary team can be watching all of the different parts of my body at once. So I may get that insurance and do the MOHS there (although the Kaiser doctor who does it near me is Harvard medical school and Harvard residency in MOHS, so doesn't get much better than that...)",

She said she spoke with the pathologist to confirm that I had micronodular basal cell carcinoma, and not just nodular -- since she wasn't sure Kaiser doctors differentiated between aggressive and non-aggressive sub-types in path reports [eye roll]. Here is her answer: \"He reviewed the slide and let me know that the lesion is small and superficial. There was one very focal area of micronodular, and he does not feel that aggressive therapy is warranted and he does not feel this is a high risk lesion. We can do EDC, or we can do an excision. If we do excision, I will send you to a surgeon to cut out the lesion and repair it with stitches.The surgeon will send the specimen to the pathologist again to check the margin for any residual lesion. EDC is less conclusive since I just scrape and burn the lesion and do not send anything to the lab. EDC is standard of care and acceptable. Excision may be a good option to give you piece of mind that the lesion is completely gone, but you will have a bigger scar and stiches. Mohs is not necessary.\" So here are my thoughts: 1. Yay, glad he doesn't think it is a high risk lesion. Although calling it \"superficial\" seems strange; if it were superficial, by definition we wouldn't need to go back and dig deeper to get the rest of it, right? We took the surface, or \"superficial\" part of the lesion and there is still more. Anyway, glad he doesn't think it is high risk. I'll take it. 2. Isn't she cute thinking I'm worried about scars on my chest? 1 cm is not a scar; THESE are scars hahahaha. 3. Are we all in agreement I should have the excision procedure with a surgeon, and then send the tissue to the pathologist for review to make sure the margins are clean? If I just do electrodessication and curettage, I'll never know if we got all of the cancer cells. Plus it is sitting right on top of my collar bone. ",

My sarcasm towards the pathologists was because they've said it is micronodular, making it a high-risk or aggressive form of basal cell carcinoma; however, my dermatologist said that the pathologists at kaiser lump micronodular with nodular (non-aggressive). I find that a bit haphazard. The subtypes are very distinct for a reason, and most literature I've found indicates that Mohs surgery should be performed on micronodular, but not necessarily on nodular. If I hadn't asked for clarification, I'd be thinking I have micronodular. I checked today and the dermatologist still hasn't heard back from the pathologist to verify which subtype I have.",

I will have to change insurance, but once I realized that the Kaiser pathologists lump micronodular in with nodular willy-nilly, I lost my confidence in getting cancer surgery done there. Here's the thing: I really like Kaiser. I had Kaiser my whole life until I went back to school and was given basically free insurance with an incredible hospital (UCSD). My body has been sort of disintegrating since 2015 (bc is just part of it), and my medical history is so complex I have to bring printed sheets with me to the doctor or I will forget my surgeries, procedures, bizarre happenings, etc. Right now I have something wrong with my spinal cord that is causing severe pain, and I have to get to the bottom of that while trying to make sure they take my skin cancer out properly so I don't end up with two or three surgeries for the same thing. I need to be followed by the best doctors at the best hospitals. Kaiser will not be sad to see me go haha (I am very expensive). I'm doing this while self-employed and trying to generate work and do the work and I'm severe pain. I'm with you: I don't understand people that say: \"Well, the doctor says....\" I mean, what the doctor says is useful and interesting, but it is not the word of God. What the doctor says is the beginning of the journey. I've really liked my family doctor at Kaiser and the physical medicine doctor I saw for my back, but even she is having to just turn me over to pain management to sort out my spinal cord. I'm awake late tonight because I'm in too much pain to sleep. We bco girls are used to dealing with the short end of the stick, so I know I'm preaching to the choir here. Thanks for the confidence to insist on the Mohs. It seemed correct with everything I was reading (clinical studies) and this just confirms it.",

So basically I don't know whether I have an infiltrating BCC right now, because the pathologists at Kaiser don't bother. I just received an email from the Mohs surgeon, because apparently she forwarded him my email and he answered me. He said Mohs surgery would only be indicated if the lesion was greater than 2 cm in diameter. That is a pretty big lesion, right? Have you had Mohs for BCC smaller than 2 cm?",

The pain is like nothing I've ever dealt with in my life, and it is ruining my life. I'm not exaggerating. Anyway, I wanted to respond to your post: The BARD1 mutation is the gene we've been talking about. You mentioned TP53 (p.s. I don't think any of them are \"good\" but I know you meant you didn't test positive for a BRCA mutation). Trivia: everyone has these genes; the problem comes in when there is a mutation to the gene. The genes suppress tumors, so if one has a mutation to the gene it doesn't work as well at suppressing a tumor. The BARD1 gene mutation has just been shown to have a higher incidence of skin cancers as well as bc. My mother took a form of DES that was supposed to be not as bad...? I can't remember, but when the news hit about how bad DES was, my father called and got the information that the one my mother took wasn't as bad or something. But the study mentioned by the moderators above is about the BARD1 mutation being linked to higher incidence of skin cancers. I too live in CA, although I tried to be a \"safe\" tanner (now they say there is no such thing, if your skin changes color you've damaged it). I did have some pretty bad sunburns as a child just by accident. Hope that answers some of your questions!",

I actually got panicky this morning with those emails, because the fact that the pathologists don't consider categorizing aggressive vs. nonaggressive BCC is just alarming. What else do they not bother with? I am switching my insurance so that I can go to USC for all of my medical care, including the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. I think I can pull it off so that I have the insurance by October 1st. Then USC can look at the pathology slides themselves, and they can decide if it is nodular or micronodular and what kind of surgery should be done. And they can use their multidisciplinary approach to look at my MX scars and their weird doings, and my lumbar spine that is disintegrating, and the new cysts on my kidney (ultrasound for that tomorrow), etc. etc. I am a complex case and I have to pay to go to the best at this point. I agree on the BCC growing in a column, and furthermore, she took the mole plus a little bit below it, and the cancer extended to the margins of the biopsy -- so we know it is deeper than what was seen on the surface.

Kayb, just a point: you correctly point out that per the statistics, in general lump with rads has the same survival rates as mastectomy. However, you added: that lump/rads is \"equally effective in preventing a recurrence.\" That is not actually the case. Mastectomy does not, in most cases with all things being equal, improve the chance of survival. A person with DCIS will have a recurrence based on the statistics of recurrences; the idea being that someone who has DCIS will get close follow-up and future recurrences or new cancers will be caught early and removed, therefore not lessening a chance of survival. The point here is if you fall in the center category of the statistic (so, no additional risk due to family history or dense breasts), your survival is not increased by mastectomy. But you may very well get another cancer in the breast tissue remaining after lump. I point this out because it is a common misconception that lump/rads vs. mastectomy is the same as it relates to cancer recurrence -- and that is not the case at all. The study only had to do with survival. :)",

Scream, yell, cry, and then play the cards you're dealt. The wire is no big deal. It is like a mammogram where the radiologist is taking xrays to see where the spot is they want to remove, and as soon as the radiologist finds it they stick a wire into the spot so the surgeon can find the exact spot (and you don't have to go through another surgery cuz they missed it!) They give you numbing medication. It felt like getting blood drawn just a little stick. No big deal. As far as the radiation: Just because someone in a white coat tells you to do something doesn't mean you \"have to\". Even doctors sometimes argue about the best treatment for cancer. The doctor is not smarter than you; he/she has just read more clinical studies and has gone to medical school. Doesn't make him/her smarter than you. So educate yourself. If after you have educated yourself you decide on radiation, then you decide how much to get and how. Sometimes just realizing that you don't \"have to\" do anything makes you feel more in control. By the end you may do exactly what this particular doctor is telling you to do and in exactly the same way -- but it is YOUR decision, not someone telling you that you \"have to\" do something. Also, are you at an NCI designated cancer center with a breast cancer specialist? If not, I recommend highly getting a second opinion there. Sorry life is handing you this bag of cr#@ right now.",

I tested positive for BARD1, which the genetic counselor said was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer after menopause, but the data is still being collected on it. I was diagnosed with DCIS in September. I had a lumpectomy for the 2 mm DCIS. At my 6 month follow up mammo in March, they found birads 4 calcifications. The biopsy showed a papilloma with no atypia. However, my surgeon says the papilloma absolutely was not there 6 months ago. I have to have the papilloma removed either way, especially since it has grown so fast making it even more suspicious. I have dense breasts that are hard to read on a mammo, and I've now had 6 biopsies (in both breasts all together) and a lumpectomy. My surgeon brought up pbmx, but said if I wanted to take tamoxifen for 6 months we could see how it goes. My feeling is, the way we would find out the tamoxifen didn't work is if I get another bc; however, my dense breasts may hide that bc on the mammo until it has spread. I feel like I'm \"overreacting\" to consider pbmx, but I also feel like I could have more cancer in there that we don't see right now, or not catch it until it's too late. Ugh. Thoughts anyone? also, anyone else here of a papilloma growing so fast? I",

After weeks of worrying and putting your attention on your breast, it is hard to move on with life as if nothing happened. Here's one way to look at it: you just had doctors all over your boobs, taking pictures, poking, and prodding. If they had seen anything that looked like IBC, they would've said something. They were very thorough and didn't dismiss your concerns -- they even did a biopsy. By the same token, weeks of poking and prodding have probably made your breast and surrounding tissue sore and bruised. If you feel like prodding you should probably put some ice on it. IBC is not subtle, and would be raising it's ugly head by now. The doctors aren't worried, so you shouldn't be either. It may not be reassuring to hear from me, since I had DCIS, but I didn't get it until age 50, and before that I had very lumpy dense breasts my whole life -- with no cancer. And my cancer was NOT a lump -- it was found as calcifications on a mammogram. So poking yourself to feel every bump is not going to be helpful right now when it is has been checked out, you don't have cancer right now, and you have lumpy boobs. Also, depending where you are in your cycle, you could have cysts filling with fluid that are going to get bigger and hurt, on top of your poor boob trying to recover from the biopsy. And boobs get stretch marks. It is easy to now worry about every little thing. It's like when you see a spider in your house and then you think there are bugs crawling on you every time a strand of hair gets on your arm. Your question is not silly! You had a scare. It's going to take some time to get over it. In the meanwhile, try to distract yourself with a project or even a walk outside when you start to get worried (and leave your poor boob alone or it is going to hurt forever). God forbid you ever get cancer, there will be plenty to worry about. So don't take up valuable life minutes by worrying now. :) I hope that helps. :)",

Our screening techniques are so good that they can see the tiniest change in breast tissue, which makes them want to zero in on it for a better look. So far, that is all that is happening -- they see some calcifications in one part of your breast, and that can mean nothing or it can mean something. So they are going to look more closely to see if it means something. I had numerous recalls for diagnostic mammograms and ultrasounds and six biopsies over the course of 20 years, before they found a tiny spot of DCIS that was caught really early when I was 50. The point is I had 20 years of it all being nothing. If you get anxious every time you get called back you'll give yourself a heart attack. The way I always got through it was this: if the doctors knew what it was, they wouldn't need to do more tests. So they don't know what it is. And if the doctors don't know what it is, then I really don't know what it is. So there is no point in trying to figure it out. Surrender to the process. Take a walk, lie in a quiet room and set your worries aside, watch comedies (Friends works best for me, or if it's really bad, Friends bloopers on youtube!).

The doctor uses the ultrasound to figure out where to put the needle. They numb you first. The needle goes in and pulls out tissue. They talk to you the whole time and tell you what they're doing. If you feel ANYTHING just tell them and they'll give you more numbing. You shouldn't feel pain. Sometimes you feel pressure or pulling, but not pain. And remember my mantra, which I will now add to: If the doctors knew what it was, they wouldn't need to do this test. So if they don't know, then you can't figure it out. More: neither they nor you have a crystal ball. If we had one, we wouldn't have to do these annoying tests. They have to just get the test done and look at the tissue and then they will know for sure. It usually takes a few days for the pathologist to look at the tissue sample, and they will call you with the results. You can ask them when they will call and whether they will call you either way, good news or bad news (they should). Here is what you can know: they don't like the look of it on the images, so they want to take a pinch out and look at it more closely. This is truly the hardest part of this whole process. We want them to say \"It is cancer\" or \"it isn't cancer\" and they just can't do that until they do the biopsy. And it is always in stages: like first a mammogram, then come back for an ultrasound, then come back for a biopsy, and the wait is excruciating. Just know that whatever it is, good or bad, you can handle it. You got this. Just one step at a time. Right now, you'll have a biopsy. Nothing to think about past that point because you don't know what will be found. So lots and lots of Friends this weekend. Start at the beginning and bingewatch this weekend.",

On 7/14/2014 the last of my three core needle biopsies, this one stereotactic, showed ADH \"with mucinous change and flat epithelial atypia\" in both the tissue with the microcalcifications and the tissue without the microcalcifications. I have an appointment with the breast surgeon at my cancer center on 7/28/2014 to discuss the Excisional Breast Biopsy I need. My mother and her sister died of breast cancer in their early 50's.  On my last mammogram the radiologist found three areas needing biopsy -- the first two were ultrasound guided biopsies to look at two masses; those masses turned out to be \"dense stromal fibrosis\", which I was told are benign. However, the ADH discovered on the stereotactic biopsy is literally right next to one of these benign tumors. My breasts are building things and this should be a no-construction zone. Does anyone know what the \"mucinous change\" means, if anything? I've been searching the internet, and I think I've found as close an answer as I can get before talking to my doctor: that ADH associated with mucinous change has a higher likelihood of having a malignancy there. By the way, I don't scare easily: I nursed both of my parents through cancer and ultimately their deaths, and you just play the cards you are dealt. However, I like to have a \"brass tacks\" sort of understanding of everything that I am dealing with, because Knowledge is Power. So if anyone has some data feel free to pass it along! :) I am thankful to have found a community of people going through the same thing.",

A lot of these you can do on the phone -- you call and make the appointment, send them all of your film and path reports, and then they talk to you on the phone. I would do that. Go online to any NCI cancer center and look at their website and I bet you will find a phone consult possibility. You can then take the data they give you and decide where to go from there; if nothing else it will put your mind at ease! sorry I didn't answer sooner I went to sleep haha. :)",

I found it difficult to get the news in pieces; for me it was like this: first, you need a diagnostic mammogram; then, you need THREE biopsies; then, the cells are just \"atypical\" (not yet cancer) but we have to do a lumpectomy to see; then waiting for the pathology results of that lumpectomy; then upgraded to DCIS. Each one of those resulted in a \"wait\" after it. Then six months later a follow up mammogram started the whole thing over again (\"you need a biopsy\") Let me tell you what I did (no joke): I painted an accent wall in my living room all by myself (picking out paint and getting materials; prep; paint; cleanup). I painted an accent wall in my living room all by myself (same as above) I pulled out an old knotty dead rose bush from my garden; this took three days of grueling back breaking work (the rose bush is not one to give up easily, much like myself). I broke a full size metal shovel; my hands and arms were bloody and I was covered in mud by the end. I planted three beautiful bougainvillea plants where the rose bush used to be. I recommend doing things with your hands and the environment that don't involve thinking. There is simply NOTHING you can do about what might be until you know what IS. What type of biopsy did you have?",

I have found that friends and family who have not been through it want to say something nice and helpful and supportive, and usually it isn't the right thing to say haha. \"Stay positive\" is one of the sayings that doesn't really help me; here are some sayings I like better: \"Get educated, get a plan, and you will feel more in control.\" \"Get on a forum and talk to other women who have been through it\" (you did that). \"Get a second opinion from an NCI designated cancer facility\" \"Let me know if you need a ride to a doctor's appt or some cooked ahead meals you can re-heat when you don't feel like cooking.\" Since friends/family don't know to say things like this, you can tell them that is what you are doing, and also ask for that specific help \"If I need a ride somewhere.....\" or \"would it be too much to ask if you cooked a few things that I could heat up when I'm not feeling great?\" People LOVE to help -- they just truly don't know what to do/say. And unfortunately, you may find a few \"friends\" who are actually just acquaintances; weed those people out fast you don't need ANY negativity right now. Also, a book that really helped me was Dr. Susan Love's \"Breast Book.\" You can get it on Amazon. I read it cover to cover and highlighted and dog eared. It helped me a lot. One of my favorite things she said was when her patients ask her \"when can I just get my life back to normal?\" she says \"there is no normal after breast cancer; it is different now.\" Once I accepted that, it made things a lot easier. I realized I just needed to find my new normal, and stop trying to go backwards to a time and place that didn't exist anymore. By the way, I had to go to palm springs to work the weekend I was waiting for my biopsy (which I KNEW would be positive) and I decided to finish work early and go to a movie at 5 pm. I got to the nearly empty parking lot early on a weekday and I sat in the car and cried and screamed for 15 minutes -- I cried so hard my sinuses clogged all the way to my eardrums. I screamed out loud at how my life would never be the same. I wailed. And then I was done, and I have rarely cried since. That was my way of \"staying positive\": sometimes in order to get to the positive you have to let out the grief and the rage and the anger, and then you can get busy with creating your future. You will get through this and you will have a new normal; it will be different, but maybe it will be better.",

Don't be worried right off the bat: doctors are so cautious these days, they want to do everything non-invasive they can to make sure there is nothing to worry about. They call it \"ruling out\" things. You can ask for a copy of the radiology report of your ultrasound and mammogram and there will be a \"Birads\" category from 0 to 5 on it. That is just a radiology grading system that will give you more data on how suspicious the doctor is. But I imagine they are just making sure. So don't worry! btw who said to come back in 6 months and who called you?",

What is sticking and not making total sense is why they wouldn't do a biopsy of a suspicious lump, if in fact they thought it was suspicious. This might help you too: It is the Radiologist who reads the mammogram, orders the ultrasound, reads the ultrasound, and orders the biopsy of any suspicious lumps or calcifications; a pathologist then looks at the tissue obtained from the biopsy and says whether it is cancer. It seems your radiologist was not concerned enough to order a biopsy, so you aren't getting a biopsy. Your doctor (is this an OB/GYN or just a family doctor?) decided to do an MRI. It is a little out of the ordinary, so you are correct to be a little confused. I would definitely ask the doctor why he wants an MRI and if he is suspicious the lump is cancer why NOT do a biopsy of the lump? Let us know what you find out! :)",
