Earlier this month, I was doing one in the shower and felt a lump in my left armpit, almost to the back of the armpit. I marinated on it a couple days and finally told my partner, he immediately said we needed to call our Dr for an appointment. My Dr did the breast exam and sent me out for a mammogram and an ultrasound. I had them done the same time a couple days later. The radiologist stated that she didn't see anything but wasn't signing off on it until she saw the films from my last mammogram back the end of 2015 which was at a different place. Today I get a call from my Dr's office stating that he wants me to go in and see a breast surgeon. I'm terrified. I have so many questions...I want to know why he wants me to see her. I called the breast surgeons office and they're closed, I left a message. I immediately called my friend who has had BC and she was able to settle me down a bit, but I'm still scared beyond reason.
