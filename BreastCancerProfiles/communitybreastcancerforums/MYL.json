If I have to, I will do 3 cycles here, that's what my doctor recommended after which they will check the response.",

And today BS told me that on top of the general anesthesia, I would also be given nerve block. Anyone had mastectomy with nerve block? I was told that it would really help with the post surgery pain and they can also use less dosage on the general anethesia part. But I can decline it if I choose so.

The doctor here said that their standard pre-operative is FEC100. from the infromation she provided, it consists of : Granisetron+Dexamethasone+Esomeprazole  Epirubicin Cyclophosphamide 5-Fluorouracil. She said that this is the international standard so I want to just get one cycle here, I can continue with the same thing after going home. One concern she had was that I'm ER+/PR+/HER- an KI-67 is 15%. she said that this profile does not respond the best to pre-operative chemo. Any input/suggestions appreciated. I really do want to start ASAP, the positive LN worries me. Thanks so much! Dx 1/12/2013, IDC, 3cm, Grade 3, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Sep 14, 2013 06:31AM - edited Sep 14, 2013 06:32AM by MYL Thanks for the replies. It does look like nerve block is used quite often these days. Sarah- sorry to hear that you are still having trouble due to the pain. Do you think the expander is the more of a culprit than the mastectomy incisions? I wish you get good relieve soon and get some quality sleep. Your body can't heal without adequate sleep. And thank you for the advices on pain management. Sandymom- it's strange the block haws not taken. I'm glad all went well nevertheless. I'm worried about the opposite. That the block would cause some permanent side effect after the surgery. Specials- that was a lot of manipulation in one surgery and I'm glad you managed well afterwards. I finally decided not to have nip/skin saved and no immediate reconstruction with expander. I hope this will make everything a lot easier.",
