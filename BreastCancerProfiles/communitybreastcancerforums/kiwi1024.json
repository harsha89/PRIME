I have't changed anything yet regarding food.   Not really, I don't even know where to begin.  I loooooove to eat.  I figure I've already got cancer and I think once the treatments start I will have to change alot of things including exercise so until then I'm just going on as usual.  Except my DH found out that Grapes were an excellent source of killing Cancer so he keeps buying grapes and grape juice and forcing me to eat and drink as much as possible.....   I finally said, Honey, I'm turning purple!!! How many pounds and ounces of this stuff do you think it will take a day for this to do any good?\"ha ha ha   Kiwi ",

I can say that because i felt the same way as far as not being upset!  I also have felt alittle guilty about how others seem more concerned about all this than me.  I was on a losing diet with WW when all this came about.  My thought was Chemo will make me lose weight so I'm having Krispy Kremes today! ha ha I have 2 sons who are preachers and my faith is strong so I seem to be taking this all in stride.  I keep telling people I turn 50 Oct 24th and I'm going to get a boob job, a breast lift and a tummy tuck! What's there to cry about?! My problem is I have unrealistic images. I am a 186 pound 5 foot women with saggy breast and a big pot belly.    I think in my mind i'm picturing what I will look like after the surgery. A 30 year old Again!! The reality is I am aware of the seriousness of all of this but the truth for me seems to be that its totally out of my hands, I have no control over this but I know the one who does so its hard to be afraid when He is in control.  Now that doesn't mean I enjoy pain and I do hate the thought of suffering any pain.  But for me I feel totally confident in the removal of the cancer and the benifit will be the tummy tuck. You will be fine. Oh and by the way I am now allowing people to pamper me!  I'M SOOOOO AWFUL!!! ha ha ha",
