I have IDC - a large tumor, but according to PET scans - it has not spread. It's responding very well to chemo - it has to be at least half the size it was before. I'm a perfect candidate for a lumpectomy, but I have to be honest that radiation therapy scares me. I have no history of breast cancer in my family, but both my cousin and I were about 15 miles from 3 Mile Island when it had a melt down, and I'm pretty convinced that the radiation we got from that is part of the reason we both have breast cancer. A lumpectomy then radiation seems to be asking for a repeat of this. Just looking for stories from people who have had a choice and picked on over the other, why, and do you have regrets?

He said he would be doing a sentinal node lumpectomy on BOTH sides, because if the breast on the left (my non-cancerous breast) does test positive for cancer, he would have to go in an remove all nodules. I've had PET scans, MRI's, and Mammos and there is no evidence of the cancer spreading anywhere or in anywhere other than my right breast. I do have a large tumor, but that seems over kill to me.

You have a wonderful man who loves you. It may not be the wedding of your dreams, but it will absolutely be a unique one. Side effects vary. Once you have a plan in place, read all about the side effects of those drugs and the timing of those side effects and plan a start date so that your wedding date will fall when you are feeling your best. I'm on AC and I do have many days when I feel pretty much normal. As for your wedding guests - ask your doctor - but mine was clear to say that that was not a huge deal. Of course, I get the Nuelasta shot, so by the time I'm feeling normal, my white blood count is fairly normal, too. ",
