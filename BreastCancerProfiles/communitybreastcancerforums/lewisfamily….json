I would go to bed at night and then spend the entire night staring at the ceiling.  After about two weeks, I finally went to my doctor.  By that time I was a total wreck.  They took my blood pressure it was like, 160 over 100.  YIKES!!!  So my doctor gave me some tranquilizers and told me NO ALCOHOL!!! I took the pill and slept like a baby!  However, it took about a month to calm down. I was just a nervous wreck. Sleep makes ALL the difference. I panic still when I don't sleep. I worry that the long stretch of sleepless nights will return once again and I will have another breakdown.  But so far, I only have short streches without sleep.  I think it's okay to take sleep aids for the short term.  I do agree that we should try to exercise and go easy on the alcohol.  I have found that drinking might help me to go to sleep initially but then I wake up in the wee hours and I can't get back to sleep. UGH!!  Good luck ladies.  I hope you find your way to sweet dreams! Anne ",

My breast cancer was DCIS--and not invasive.  Even so, I had ten years of abnormal mastectomies.  I had biopsies, met with oncologists and talked about various drug therapies, etc....... Years ago I decided if the real thing actually happened, I wanted my breasts GONE!!  Well, a year ago, my surgeon called with the news. It was an easy decision for me. Now, a year later, I feel SOOO at peace!!! My god-given breasts are gone, but, oh well!!!  I do NOT have breast cancer, and my doctors tell me I am 99 % cured!!!!    I have perky \"foobs\" and I am just plain HAPPY!!!!!   I was never attached to my \"real\" breast so this was such an easy decision, and I understand if you feel differently than me, but it was just the best choice for me!    Good luck, no matter what you choose, and please feel free to PM me and ask any questions you may have.  It is TRULY amazing how easy a mastectomy is.  It sounded so scary to me when I was considering it, but it was so easy and worked out so well for me!!  Hugs to you!

I see all of the kids at our school (550) so there are bound to be some who have struggled with cancer in their immediate families, and I hate to upset them further. Anyway, I do agree that honesty with children is the best way to go. Still, I have decided to keep it as brief as possible. One thing about kids--they don't need lengthy explanations. They just want reassurance! I can't wait to get back to them (the day after MLK will be my first day back-YAY!)",

My other side had atypical cells so even though it wasn't dcis I am confident that it was at risk for future problems, so it was ALL good!!

For me, this surgery was pretty easy compared with the mastectomy back in December. It was shorter, but still about 2 hours long. Evidently, I developed a lot of scar tissure internally around the implants, and that had to all be removed. So, my PS had to put interrnal stitches in to hold my new implants in place. Also, and this is kind of funny, I guess I am \"asymmetrical\" and when he put the the same size implants in, they didn't match. It seems my chest wall isn't even or something. SO.....I now have a 400 cc implant on my right side and a 450 cc implant on my left side. That should be interesting!!! I am definiitely in pain--I am taking percocet about every 3 hours or so, but I am hoping that won't last too long. They gave me A LOT of pain pills (I thiink I have over 150 total from all the bottles I have been given in the past six months) so that is good, I guess?? My DH is just awesome. We are teachers and just out of school for the year so he is doting on me. He was SO worried about the surgery and everything. What a sweet guy! I hope you are all doing great.

At that time, they tried to do the need core biopsy, but I was a lousy candidate, due to claustrophobia and not wanting to be \"still\" that long on my tummy!! So, they did a surgical biopsy and found these cells. I was referred to an oncologist who wanted me to go on tamoxifen but I ultimately chose not to, due to the side effects. This last October, I had yet another biopsy and this time, the found DCIS, and so I had a double mastectomy, after which they found additional DCIS in the breast that had the biopsy. The other breast had \"suspicious cells' that might or might not have developed into DCIS. My advice would be to research the hell out of this and make your own decision, based on your research and your gut! For me, it was the mastectomy, but many many women opt for other treatments including radiation and drug therapies. It really is a crap shoot in my honest opinion, but for me, just getting rid of the threat made me feel better!! Good luck to you! Anne",

I heard from Daniella that you were both doing surgery this month, and I know she is through hers now so it's good to hear that you are now through yours! The first week is the toughest so you are almost there! I am now about five weeks out and the pain is almost gone except at night when I stretch out in bed it seems to hurt more and the expanders dig in at weird places. Pain meds get me through the night pretty well! I start teaching this next week so we will see how that goes! Hope everything goes great for you and feel free to PM me if you have any questions about stuff since I am a bit ahead of you and can let you know what to expect! Anne",

Obviously, I am cancer-free (at this point) and as a bonus, I have these wonderful, albeiit not real, foobs that are so very perky!!!  Where's the downside????????     The scars are fading quickly and although I am still deciding on nipples, whateever I decide will be better than the alternative.   I look upon this as a blessing.  I hated my breasts.  34 DD was just too big!!!!!!   This defintely is a decision you will need to make based upon your individual situation.  Go with your gut and your needs.........don't let others sway you.  Listen to your heart!

So my wonderful husband rushed out to the grocery store to purchase some. He returned and said, \"Honey, I have good news and bad news. The good news is I got the press and seal wrap. The bad news is all they had was the \"holiday\" kind. So there I was, buck naked except for that holiday wrap around my middle, complete with Frosty, Rudolph and Santa adorning me.
