It was a week after my last period, so I thought it was unusual but chalked it up to hormones. My next period came and went, and my left breast went back to normal but the right breast continued to be tender. After another few weeks of excruciating pain, I decided to see my doctor. She gave me a breast exam, told me I had fibrous breasts, and assured me my pain was coming from hormones. She told me if my breast still hurt in 6 months, she would run some further tests. Later that night, on the same day I had had my appointment, I was feeling my left breast and a clear, sticky discarge came out of only one duct. This is the opposite breast of the one that is in excruciating pain. The next morning I called my doctor first thing and told her what was going on. I've got one breast that is excruciatingly painful, and the other that feels fine, but I can extract discharge from when pressed. Upon the news of the discharge, she sent me to the lab to have some hormone tests done. She said if those come back normal, she will order a mammogram. I am terrified. Crying on and off. The worst case scenario possibility is all I can think about. I keep reading about how discharge is worrisome if it comes from only one breast, and is sticky which is exactly what I have. And why one aches and the other has discharge? No idea. Doctor is pretty convinced its hormones. What do you all think? Any words of advice or encouragement? I have no family history of breast cancer on my moms side, but both of my dads sisters are survivors. I just don't know what to think.... Log in to post a reply",
