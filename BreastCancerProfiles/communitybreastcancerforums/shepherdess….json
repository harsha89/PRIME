Mostly, I got through it pretty well. I waited almost 3 weeks before starting Arimidex so I would have no BC treatments for a while but to also make sure side effects from rads didn't confuse possible side effects from hormine therapy. So far, so good. Shepherdess ",

I thought if I woke up from surgery without any drains I was good to go--no chemo--that's what I was told. Then during my post-op visit we were informed of this recently available test for the genetics of the tumor and suddenly my husband and I are looking at one another in disbelief. My score is 24, right smack in the middle, nothing clear about it. I will find out more with my oncologist this next week. Part of me is grateful for all this new medicine and part of me really wonders how much of this will result in over treatment, It all feels soooo unnatural. I guess our choices are both burden and blessing. I think I/we will feel better when I actually choose a path. Until then I'm praying and researching and grateful to have found this site. Here's to our healing... Shepherdess ",

It surprised me more than anything. It's more pressure that you will feel than pain. My reoccurring thought was, wow, what they can do for women with breast cancer today. The women who worked on and with me were lovely. Let them know you're uneasy and I'm sure they will support you. You'll be on the other side of it soon! Love and support, Shepherdess ",

It took another couple of weeks to finally resolve but I'm fine now. One note: I also have cording, the inflamation of the lymphatic vessels. I went to the PT at Mercy Breast center in Baltimore--she is fantastic. She told me that women with cording and seromas are more likely to develop lumphadema at some point in time (apparently we all have a \"lifetime risk\") so she showed me some gentle massage to drain the lymphatic fluid out of the area.  It helped a lot. Maybe it can help you too. I hope so! Good luck! Shepherdess ",

My surgeon called me this AM  and said he felt that because all my other results were favorable that my score of 24 did NOT automatically mean chemo. Surprised me a little (happily). He also said each onc will have a slightly different recommendation....great. I'll get more info from my 1st onc on Wed. The waiting is hard part.
