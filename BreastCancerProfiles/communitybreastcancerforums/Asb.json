I keep thinking about how much time I have already spent and will spend hooked up to an infusion, and where I get my infusions is nice enough. But when I am done with this AND win the lottery I want to open an infusion suite that looks a little more like a coffee house or wine bar. Cute tables ( with very comfy chairs of course) and couches. Real food instead of peanut butter crackers. I am thinking a few private rooms for your first time or if you just want to sleep. Maybe massage chairs and mani/pedis. I think we deserve to be \"treated\" in style!",

I finally crawled out of my hole after a week. Third THC put me on my butt. I had ( still having to some extent) a lot of heart palpitations. With my heart working overtime the exhaustion was brutal. I am now on a beta blocker which has my heart rate to mostly within the normal range.i still don't know if I will be changing treatments or having surgery earlier since the tumor has not gotten smaller. Mo said it could be dying in spots which would not show an overall change in size, it could be dead tissue or it's possibly that it is not responding. There is no definitive test, imaging can give a general size but cannot show whether the tissue is dead or alive, but as long as it is not getting bigger we are ok. He seems more worried about the heart issues than the tumor size. I have tried to be positive throughout all of this but it has been hard this week I would really love to go to the gym and work off some frustration, but oh yeah can't do that because of the germs. I am wishing I hadn't sold my sons punching bag in the last garage sale. I could use it right now. Ok enough negative for now. On a different note, are those of you who lost hair slick bald? When mine started coming out in fistfuls I shaved my head, but still had the fuzz, I haven't lost that, and it is growing, I still have a strip on my legs and under my arms that I have to shave as well. Weird. I have not used Elma cream, it hurt the first couple of times a little but I barely feel it now. I hope everyone has a restful SE free weekend. I desperately need a day of feeling like myself.

Cant be sure if the imaging was off or if the damn thing was still growing through the chemo. The good news is they got it all, and still no node involvement but it does mean I now have to start over with chemo. This time I will be getting AC.  I think I am still in shock that I spent 4 months paying thousands of dollars to have poison injected into me and it did nothing.

My current tumor was under a cyst, I had it checked out because I had never had a cyst there before. I just don't think I can take the stress every time a new cyst pops up. I just want them gone, although not looking forward to the recovery time and the tissue expanders, but think in the end it is the best decision for me. My MO an BS seemed relieved at my decision.  Those of you who have already had surgery are you happy so far with your decision? Curlyq, welcome! The thought of losing my hair was the hardest for me as well. I have only had mine shaved for a couple of days, but it hasn't been that bad. I found a wig I like and have been making myself some hats, and will probably add some scarfs to the wardrobe as well. And it is a great excuse to buy some new fun earrings.",

I had an ultrasound and the tumor is not bigger, but is not smaller either. MO wanted to monitor through the rest of that cycle. I have now had #4 and still feel like it is bigger. At the time of dx I could feel it but not see it, now I can see it. I know the shape has changed. MO said it could be dying in spots or the shape change could also be necrosis, but it is also possible that it is not responding to the chemo. My daughter's boyfriends father is also an MO and he recommends doing surgery now, if the tumor is responding then we just pick up with the same chemo after surgery, if it is not responding then they will switch me to AC. My MO agreed. I am meeting with the BS tomorrow to see what he thinks. The unknown is very stressful. Hopefully tomorrow I will have a plan. Tekwriter, sorry you are having a rough time with the taxol. That is how I felt after this last round, nothing specific just felt like crap. I feel like the cumulative effect is starting to take hold. ",

My RBC are always low and I have had to have one transfusion, but no issues with WBC. I have two friends going through this and one gets neulasta as needed the other gets it like me after every tx. I finally got my surgery date. I will be having a BMX on April 21. I will be glad for the break from chemo but anxious to find out what has been going on in there. I really hope to find out that even though the tumor hasn't been shrinking the chemo has been working and the sucker is dying. Then I can just finish my last two rounds and be done. I really don't want to start over with AC. I am still doing the weekly herceptin. But at least there are minimal side effects from that. I go Thursday for a cardiac stress test and to get a heart monitor put on for 24 hours. Hopefully they can figure out what is going on with my heart. When I wake up in the morning before I take my medicine my heart rate is usually about 125. It makes me very jittery. I have yet to get back to normal after round 4 ( three weeks ago).",

What's weird is the hair that never fell out is growing. In the back most of it is about an inch long, but very thin. I wonder if what I have left will come out when I start back on chemo after the surgery. Today would have been tx 5 of 6.",
