I'm having my second lumpectomy tomorrow and I have chosen the breast conservation approach because, as far as I understand, with the little literature we can find and all, Phyllodes comes back, usually within a year, and a couple of times. It also can come back to lungs or kidneys (if I'm nor mistaken), which seems it would be harder to find out in a timely matter (as it grows fast and silently). So, as mentioned before, it can be aggressive (deadly) if spreads. In these scenarios, I believe that in the absence of breast things can go south pretty quickly, and that's why I choose to keep as much breast tissue possible, just because I found it both times quite easily, and would not want to risk otherwise. It seems that Phyllode has a very low chance to metastasize, and so, any risk of recurrence would be (in my opinion) \"saver\" in the breasts, than elsewhere. That's my 2 cents. But I also believe we all should look inside our hearts and move from there, not from mind or fear. Any decision we make with an agreement with our hearts will have better results. I hope you all can find strength, peace and clarity to continue this journey as healthy and positively as possible. Good luck to you all. Keep strong! Sinceraly, A",
