I see a genetist there, was seen by both a MO at Methodist in Houston, and a MO at MDA....I actually liked the MO at MDA better, but.....wait for it....she was the MO that tried to kill her MO boyfriend at MDA. Bit of a scandal for MDA back in 2010-11, I imagine. She is still in jail, I believe..... I am not a stage 4 though...is this just an issue based on what stage that you are currently? I feel bad and really stupid asking that question....please forgive meðŸ˜” If you share where you live, I bet others can chime in with suggestions? MSK is currently rated #2 and, actually has been rated # 1 in the very recent past. Dana Farber is also an excellent center.",

Not likehaving the thought of that one .......settling into one DX. Based on the biopsy, and finding out that there is something lurking around in there that is nastier than we thought....a double whammy of sorts. Regarding reconstruction, I will most likely just do a lumpectomy if it is DCIS or LCIS and take it from there...I have to research more reconstruction methods and issues.....if a higher grade neoplasm is found, then I will proceed to a complete BMX, let it heal, get thru treatment and then consider fat transfer in Miami. I spoke with the center years ago, after that monster Phyllodes was removed, so, at least I know that they take my insurances.....but we will cross that bridge when the time comes. I have a serious condition that is really going to hamper my treatment options Common Variable Immune Deficiency can, and does render us unable to \"correct\" all the cellular damage that Rads can do to healthy cells...we are considered \"sensitive to radiation\" and should limit exposure. I image this also includes Proton therapy, although there is some differences to the application and nuclear structure of the treatment...so I don't know Regarding my previous comments regarding breast augmentation, I pursued a visit with a couple different plastic surgeons in the past. I'm very tall 5'10 and about 120 pounds in my youth. I am still 5 foot10 and closer to 150 pounds which is probably right size for someone like me who is very small boned yet tall. I have small breasts only a A-B cup and was looking to just look more balanced....I never gain any weight in my breasts...my gym even noticed this. There are several reasons why this might be...one of which is that fact that I am a DES daughter, and PCOS even thought I have never really been overweight, exercise 5 days a week and have a low A1C....but I am a reactive hypoglycemic.....and a disordered insulin metabolism is a contributor to developing neoplasms....which is why I take Metforim. I never went thru with any breast enhancements",

It left a good sized crater, which \"somewhat\" filled in with fat tissue over the past 7 yrs. That breast does not gain weight when the left one does....and I have no idea why....need to ask the BS. next time we speak Anyway...the lumpectomy site often hurts, or burns/pulls when I lift weights, or use that arm too often....well, it is my right arm, soo....what can I do about it, really? Perhaps being small breasted has something to do about it? Less fat/ breast tissue to protected the damaged nerves?The type of pain is consistent, and has never changed...so I never gave it too much thought. Nerve damage, I imagine?",

There are what are considered \"rare\" benign breast lesions that can present as a neoplasm, but actually are not....one such type is a hemangioma. He believes there is a possibility that this is the issue here. I looked up the findings per the Bi-Rads manual....and it is possible. Rare, but possible......he has seen quite a few the last few years. In the past, very, very rarely. Wonder, oh wonder \"why\" there is an uptick of unusual breast neoplasms now? It isn't enhanced ability to discover these little nasties....they were pretty good at catching these way back in the 60's when they presented. I am wondering about all the DES usage back in my mother's generation.....many women born before pre mid-1964 had mothers who took the drug. For what-ever reason, our mothers might not have shared this information with us. They may not remember, and the doctor was always right back then, so most would have not ever questioned what it was they were taking. Getting a baby on the planet and starting a family was the main concern. Totally understand that emotion...the strong desire to be a mother. Hemangioma's can be malignant, but they are typically a larger mass by then. Due to the fact that I had a Phyllodes removed from my lefty 7 yrs ago \"sorta\" sets me up for any other type of lesion that presents with the sarcoma type presentation....scary crap, since angiosarcomas are nasty little creatures. And radiation can add to the chance of an angiosarcomas 5-12 yrs after the fact. They state that it is a low level of possibility, but I have to feel that there is genetics behind my original Phyllodes, and this might give me a pre-disposition to sarcoma \"type\" lesions. That Phyllodes and I was hustled over to M.D Anderson genetics department...It's fairly rare, so they probably want to see the genetics behind all patients who present with this tumor ",

If I ever require radiation, it has to be absolutely the lowest dose possible, and for the shortest duration of time, We do not repair the DNA damage done by radiation to our healthy cells such as a otherwise healthy cancer patient would. We also deal with low WBC counts and low Natural Killer cell counts. Rads and chemo just blows a complete \"hole\" in our immune systems, very simply put. They have found two genes that are implicated in CVID, so I hear ya regarding it being a concern Besides for the link posted by Gracie22, reach out to the NCI, and the assoiciation for rare disorders, as they might have additional information for you. The NIH is another possibility.",
