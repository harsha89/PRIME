I am wondering if this seems normal - all the puffiness that was in front totally moved to the left, under my armpit and into my back last Thursday. I still have a drain and my surgeon doesn't need to see me until the fluid draining is under 10 ccs a day. Honestly, I had no pain after surgery, but these huge fluid pockets under my arm are really uncomfortable. Did anyone else experience this? Thanks",
