Talk to folks here.  They are incredible, very supportive and it is a place where you can express your fear.  2.)  Stay busy by planning things.  I had a friend take me to a movie the day of my biopsy.  Those 2 hours were a much needed break fromt the anxiety and worry - I was less anxious after we left the theater.  3.)  I planned a brunch on the Sunday before results with close friends - it lasted for 4 hours!  We had a blast - they listened to me and then we just talked about fun things.  4.)  Pamper yourself!  I love a nice hot bath.  One day I took 3 baths!  If your finances allow, go get a massage, manicure, pedicure.  Be nice to yourself, you deserve it. 5.)  If you can, only allow yourself to get on the internet and visit this site.  There are some very frightening things on the internet.  Don't try to diagnose yourself.   These were the things which helped me.  If you find yourself unalbe to rest at night, call your doctor.  Don't be afraid to ask for medication if you need it. Know the women here know what you are going through.  They really care for you.  Not sure about your personal faith, but want you to know I have said a prayer for you.  That God will wrap you in his peace, bring your comfort and B9 results!",
