The procedure itself is done under twilight (light) anesthesia and you do not feel a thing. Procedure goes quickly and recovery is soreness. Most people you don't see any signs that they have a port. My sticks out so can be uncomfortable because I hit it or clothes rub against it...BUT still worth it. Cannot tell you how may times I have watched patients sit as the nurses struggle to get IV's going. I got a prescription for Lidocaine which I apply before my treatment to the top of the port then I cover with a Tegaderm. By the time the nurse access the port it is numb so I do not feel the needle.  You can do this! ",

I was diagnosed on June 2, 2008 (age 40) with right sided invasive ductal carcinoma and DCIS. I underwent 20 weeks of chemo/herceptin, bi lateral mastectomy, reconstruction and now continuing herceptin until June 16, 2009. I began Tamoxifan for 5 years on December 30th with no side effects. I have 2 teenagers and I was consumed with the \"what ifs\" of not seeing them grow-up. I am in a much better place now as treatment has been successful. I have all the faith in the world that you will thrive. Surgical procedure is a personal choice. For me...bi lateral was the only thing I would consider and have absolutely no regrets! Left side was healthy but mastectomy has eased my worry. Surgery was not nearly as hard as expected. Recovery was a good 6 weeks. Hardest part for me was asking for help!!! Please let me know how you are doing. All the best, Kris ",

Although...the aroma is making me want to open a good bottle of red wine and have some parmesan and french bread! I had my color done yesterday and bought the DevaCare No Poo and One Conditioner. Product is made by DevaCurl for color treated hair. Sulfate free and helps to tame the wild curl beast! Hair stylist told me curly hair only needs to be washed twice per week but scalp massaged in shower under hot water and then lightly conditioned daily. Another trick is to use a t-shirt to get water out of hair instead of a towel which can cause breakage and frizz in curly hair. Biggest rule is do not touch while its drying. If you just let it air dry there is no frizz to speak of. I had no idea curly hair had so many rules! ",

I felt like it was the only thing I was in control of...when I lost my hair. I found cutting it was very liberating. Short hair was new to me and sooooo easy...quick shower...towel dry and out the door! I'd laugh at how long it took my daughter to dry and fix her hair and wondered how many hours of my life had I lost to primping! ",

A lot of women just sleep in recliners. I didn't have that option. My kids were older 14 and 17 so they were able to help. Of course reaching and lifting are a no no. Have they done biopsies yet? Once you get pathology they will be able to come up with a treatment plan. You need to know your ER, PR, HER2 status. I had chemo first to shrink tumor but elected for mastectomy anyway. Some doctors prefer surgery first. Depends on your team and what you want. Please know you are not alone. We have all been right where you are and we want to help you through this nightmare.

Be sure to keep them out of reach of children and pets! To make the air more fragrant, use essential oils or boiled herbs. To make herbs, simply choose any herb or spice the smell of which you enjoy and boil it in water for a few minutes until the heat causes it to release its aroma. Let it cool a little and put it out in a bowl. You can also add salt to discourage the growth of fungus. Drain Cleaner: Use hair and food traps to keep the drain from getting clogged. If it does become clogged, try the following recipe. First, pour about 1/2 cup of baking soda down the sink. Then add at least a cup of vinegar. It will start to fizz. Put the cover over the drain. Finish up by rinsing the drain with a mixture of boiling salt water. You might have to repeat the procedure. Toilet Bowl Cleaner: Sprinkle baking soda around the inside of the toilet bowl and then clean with a toilet brush. Also try letting white vinegar sit for a few minutes in the bowl before cleaning with toilet brush.  Oven Cleaner: Make a paste of baking soda and water. First wipe away any residual grease. Then scrap off burnt spots with scouring brush or steel wool. Finally, apply paste and scrub. Laundry Detergent: By adding baking soda, you can reduce the amount of commercial detergent you use substantially. If you're using liquid detergent, add about 1/2 cup of baking soda at the beginning of the wash. If you are using powdered detergent, add 1/2 cup baking soda during rinse cycle. Baking soda softens the water, thus increasing the potency of your detergent. When buying commercial detergent, it is better to use biodegradable, less toxic, phosphate free brand. Window Cleaner: Put 3 Tablespoons vinegar per quart of water into spray bottle. Automatic Dishwashing Detergent:  As you pile dishes in the sink, sprinkle with baking soda. Then, later when you put them in the dishwasher you can use a lot less commercial detergent. It's the same basic idea as with the laundry detergent. Carpet Cleaner: To absorb big spills, spread cornmeal all over the spill. Wait about 15 minutes, then vacuum it up. For stains, put 1/4 cup biodegradable liquid soap with 1/3 cup water into blender to make foam. Put the foam on the stain and rub. Finish up with a splash of vinegar. Kitchen Cleanser: Just use baking soda on non-scratch surfaces, and a vinegar water mixture on other surfaces. Tub and Tile Cleaner: Mix 1 and 2/3 cup baking soda, 1/2 cup liquid soap, 1/2 cup water and finally 2 tablespoons vinegar (if you add the vinegar too early it will react with the baking soda). Then apply, wipe and scrub. Shoe Polish: Use a little olive oil. Brass and Copper Cleaner: Cut a lemon in half, sprinkle it with salt and rub the lemon on whatever needs to be polished. Buff with cloth to remove excess lemon juice. Silver Polish: Put a sheet of aluminum foil into plastic of glass bowl. Sprinkle the foil with salt and baking soda, then fill the bowl with warm water. Just soak your silver in the bowl and the tarnish will migrate to the foil. Finally, dry and buff. Fragrance: If you are not chemically sensitive or allergic, essential plant oils can be a pleasing addition to homemade cleaners. A few drops can enhance our perception of cleanliness. Commerical Cleaners and Disinfectants If you do not feel like making your own cleaners, there are a number of less toxic alternatives which can be found at organic and natural grocery stores, co-ops and many larger conventional stores as well. Examples include: Ecover, Earth's Best, Seventh Generation, Earthrite, Earth Friendly, Bio Clean, Life Tree and Dr. Bronner's. Organic and biodegradable products are generally the safest. Natural products tend to be the next safest and conventional cleaners and disinfectants are the least safe. ",

After I found out about lavender and tea tree...I google before I buy. Found out about lavender by googling lavendar and estrogen. donnabee, Dr. Bronner's has a line of all purpose essential oil soaps that you can buy at Target now. Almond and peppermint smell great! We use as hand soap but it can be used for everything! ",

If it make you feel any better about things...I saw my medical oncologist today and I was drilling her about my prognosis. She said I have such a small chance of recurrence that she is not worried. I have 2 more Herceptin infusions and she said I should enjoy my life. They aren't setting me free...I will have follow-ups every 3 months and am taking Tamoxifen but things look good. 11 months ago when I was diagnosed...IDC, DCIS, ER+, PR+, HER2+, BRAC- I couldn't imagine being so healthy today. Herceptin is an amazing drug and should really help your moms %. Your mom has a long road but she will be fine. I have all the faith in the world that she will beat this. My oncologist words \"breast cancer is no longer a death sentence\".",
