It helps to have a focus for me. Golf, sunshine and no more chemo! About 1/4 of my hair came out in the shower this morning. It shouldn't have scared me since I knew it was coming but it did.

I just found out my WBC is too low right now for a fill or my chemo this week. So I have a few days to get it up or I'll lose a week before the wedding. Why aren't there any magic pills to get our WBC counts up?? Went out golfing yesterday and going back today. First time since all this began. Felt great. That's gotta do something positive for me!

It's called S0307 Phase III Trial of Bisphosphonates as Adjuvant Therapy for BC. The paper on it states 'To find out if adding a drug (a bisphosphonate) to hormonal therapy or chemotherapy will help prevent cancer from spreading to the bones'. There are 3 groups. 2 take a pill by mouth and 1 gets a monthly IV. I haven't decided if I will do it but I see him tomorrow for #3 so maybe we will talk about it.I have a 20 page paper on it if anyone wants more info. Have to get labs today and pray the WBC is high enough for #3 tomorrow. It was 3.2 yesterday and they went ahead with my fill even tho they said 3.5-4.0. They put 150 cc's in each which is huge. I feel like I have boobs again (almost). Hope all going today have smooth sailing.",

My daughter and her husband (of 2 weeks) both graduate from medical school tomorrow A huge milestone in their lives. She told me she was going to be a doctor when she was 6! My advice to them was to always treat with compassion as well as knowledge. They will be a great addition to the medical community. But I may be bias. Congrats to all who have finished but really good thoughts to all still on this part of the journey. We will all be here till the last are finished.

Hurray for those done, hang in there for those still in chemo and then there is rads and reconstruction. We all started together in March... but I can't really say time flys. I had my exchange surgery done on Friday. It was scarier than the first 3 surgeries. Maybe because it's what I will live with from here on out. It went really well. I am pleased with the results. For those still contemplating reconstruction I have to say I am glad I went down this road. It was a hard decision but that's just one of many we have... So now I am wondering what it mans to be 'DONE'. No more appts, no more IV's no more cancer? I hope so. Take care all Kathy",
