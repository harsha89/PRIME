I started chemo last Wednesday 3/20. I'm doing TC x4, three weeks apart. Nausea has been manageable and of course some constipation which is improving. Fatigue is my biggest issue right now plus aches from the Neulasta. I had a lumpectomy in February and a high oncotype which is why I'm doing chemo. Just wondering if anyone has had issues with mouth sores and how you're trying to prevent or manage them. I'm trying to keep up good oral hygiene and follow the directions of my doc but my tongue has some tenderness and not sure if that's just part of the chemo or beginning of sores. Thanks and wishing you all strength and blessings as you go through chemo.",
