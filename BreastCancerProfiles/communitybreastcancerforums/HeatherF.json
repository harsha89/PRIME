I am BRCA1+ previvor (no cancer dx). I chose to have a prophylactic bilateral nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction 11/07. I had this surgery with Drs Ashikari and Saltzberg in NY even though I live in Chicago. I am really pleased with the results and I thankfully had no complications. For some women even with a cancer dx this procedure may be an option. It certainly is worth investigating and I believe worth the travel if it makes sense for you personally. This isn't a great piece but it does somewhat address the procedure: http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=5624418&page=1 I am the Chicago FORCE outreach coordinator supporting women dealing with hereditary cancer issues and learned about these great docs through FORCE www.facingourrisk.org. This is a wonderful organization with a vibrant message board as well. Interestingly enough I learned just after my surgery that there was in fact a wonderful local doctor team in Chicago offering the same procedure. Dr. DJ Winchester and Dr. Geoffry Fenner. They were featured in the Pulitzer prize winning NY Times article by Amy Harmon featuring Dr. Lindner and her journey through the same procedure. www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/hea... In the last year and half I have seen many of their patients an they are so happy. I actually took on a part-time role with Dr. Fenner doing Patient Support for his breast cancer and BRCA+ patients since he really wanted patients to have an outlet to connect with someone from start to finish in the reconstruction process.  In the last 6 months Dr. Fenner has had a number of patients travel from various parts of the country to work with him which is a real testament to his skill and the warmth and compassion his practice has to offer patients. Nothing about this journey is easy which is why it is nice to work with the best medical team you can locate. ",

The NorthShore University Hospital (formerly Evanston) has an EXCELLENT genetics group focused on BRCA led by Dr. Wendy Rubenstein. Scott Weissman is a fantastic CGC that who your sister could talk with very easily. Your sister should be treated High Risk given your mother's pre-menopausal BC. This means your sister should be under the care of a Surgeon who specializes in Breast Cancer. Someone like Dr. DJ Winchester also at NorthShore has an amazing reputation...in Chicago there a number of good options. Right now most Breast doctors are suggesting young high risk women to have a mammogram every year alternating with a MRI every year along with monthly self breast exams plus an exam by the Surgeon every year. Your sister may also want to visit the FORCE website www.facingourrisk.org. In Chicago there is a local chapter that meets quarterly. I am actually one of the coordinators for this peer to peer support effort for people dealing with hereditary cancer issues. We hold quarterly meetings and our next meeting is July 25th at Gilda's Club 1pm-3pm. I can tell you firsthand taking your own healthcare into your hands is CRITICAL these days. My mother had been 30+ year BC survivor and learned at the age of 58 she had Stage IV Ovarian Cancer. This is also when we learned that she carried the BRCA1 mutation. I then learned that I also shared this same genetic mutation. My mother lost her 15 month battle with Ovarian Cancer but I argue it was not in vain. If she had not been dx we would not have learned about the mutation and I would not have had the chance to do something to take care of my own health preventatively. I am a 30 something mother of 2 lovely little boys who I have every intention of living a long life for...",
