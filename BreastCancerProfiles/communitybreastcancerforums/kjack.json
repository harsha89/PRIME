There were a couple of days that were a bit tiring, but nothing a good night's sleep didn't help.  Good luck to you!",

I did some research over the weekend, and found a product - Xclair - that was available locally with a prescription.  When I asked the rad tech about it, she said, \"You mean the nurse didn't give you any samples of that?\"  I was HOT!!!  The angel went and raided the nurse's drawer and made sure that I had what I needed.  Other than that, I'm doing pretty well physically.  Emotionally, I've had a few bad moments, but it seems to help to read what y'all are also doing to keep on keeping on!",
