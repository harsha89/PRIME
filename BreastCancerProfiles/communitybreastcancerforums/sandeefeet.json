It's for motion sickness I know and that's what I usually use it for but I've used it for other nausea situations and suggested it to others with success. Active ingredient:  Dimenhydrinate 50 mg Inactive ingredients: colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, lactose, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose  They sell a non-drowzy form. Who knows, maybe it would help.",

      "Content": "sandeefeet wrote: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer Dec '06, had a mastectomy, went through the chemo treatments. Over a year has gone by with a clean bill of health. Three months ago her PET Scan showed spots on two ribs, right hip, lower back and liver. Her oncologist sent her for an MRI then to a nearby University to have her MRI read. The University sent her for a bone biopsy two weeks ago. The oncologists nurse called my mother and advised they couldn't exactly read the results of the MRI, uh what?!?!? They believe the area's have metastasized but they would call the University and have them read the results. She then got a call that they want her to have another PET scan next week. No further information. She works for a large medical insurance outfit. She went to the nurses there and they advised her to have the results faxed to her. She did so. A nurse read the results with my mother and advised that the notes on the results confirm the bone is affected, I don't know the specific notation we live in different states, and she is being told the PET Scan they are doing next week will determine what method of treatment they will prescribe if any. Can anyone tell me what is going on? Log in to post a reply",
