When I bend over or lean forward the pain intensifies then subsides. It feels like gravity is stretching my breast. I have no swelling or redness and can't feel any lumps. I called my obgyn today and they feel it's nothing to worry about as I am premenopausal. Is this normal? Log in to post a reply",
