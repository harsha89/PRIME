That being said how long before I quit getting new blisters and the redness and the burning completely disappear? I'm in my 5th week post SAVI. My tumor was stage 1, grade 3, 0 node, ER+, PR+, HER2- invasive carcinoma very high on my right chest. I am radiosensitive (no more dental x-rays because of blisters and sores). My site is not infected. I guess external radiation would have been much worse for me, than the internal SAVI. given my radio sensitivity.",
