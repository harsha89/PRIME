I feel like this question is a basic request to know if i'm planning on dying soon. Does anyone have any good ideas about how to answer this question?  Any help would be appreciated.

I was excited about finishing up chemo last week and feeling that maybe I was going to survive this cancer thing afterall. It was odd...my radio-onc seemed totally doom and gloom. She even went as far as to say if the cancer had moved to the lymph nodes then it was probably already somewhere else in my body and that in the past they didn't really think radiation would do much to help with that...then she said \"we're starting to find that radiation does increase the chances of survival for people in your situation.\" Um, starting to think? I will admit I've been pretty depressed this last week, which tends to happen to me a couple of days after cvhemo, but she acted like I was already dead!! She went through the path report with me and explained that I had 3 positive lymph nodes (as if I didn't already know this information) and basically said we would need to wait until my cell counts are up. She acted like she was talking to a little kid who had very little chance of survival. I'm so frustrated and upset. I hope everyone else is having a better start to radiation than I am and a little more positive outlook from the onc.",

Librarylil - Sorry you had a hard time with the RO. I also cried when I met with mine. Different reasons, but same idea. The cream my RO gave to me is a diaper cream for babies and then some other lotion. Both contained parabens (which i'm steering clear of because of my ER+ BC). I mentioned this to my RO and she said that, really, its ok to use anything within reason and her patients use a variety of things. I ran my combonation by her and she agreed that it was fine and already used by a number of patients she is treating. I am using Calendula gel mixed with 100% aloe vera gel 2-3x daily. I paid about 5.00 for each (much cheaper than ordering the Miaderm) So far its working great. I bought a tube of the calendula and then a bottle of aloe from our natural food store and mix them together in my hand. The RO actually said if the office could afford to purchase the Calendula cream and hand it out to everyone they would because it works so well. My naturopath also recommended opening a vitam E capsule and adding it to the mixture. I haven't done this because the aloe already contains E and I don't want to \"overuse\" antioxidants and mess up treatment.",

I tend to want to push through things no matter the side-effects so I have played down a lot of my symptoms with my doctors to ensure that they don't stop treatment. I'm glad that my RO is noticing the skin though - that way we can take care of things before they get too bad!  Today is number 18!",

I've been trying to stay away from Parabens because they mimic estrogen in the body. Any ideas on good creams that don't contain parabens?  They gave me some miaderm also, but I can't find any information on the Miaderm as far as parabens go.  Hope everyone is doing well so far!",
