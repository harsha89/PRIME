It's not as bad, thank goodness, but it's definitely an issue, especially when it's cold and/or sunny. The right eye more than the left, but both have problems. I tried tear duct surgery (a waste of time and money), moisturizing drops, and homeopathic drops. I sort of tried flax seed oil but am considering it again, as it helped my dog with his dry-eye problem (lol). My eye doctor suggested acupuncture but I haven't tried that. All I can say is if the only long-term side effect I have from Stage IIIB breast cancer is watery eyes, then I will just have to cope for the rest of my life!",
