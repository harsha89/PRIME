I do experience stiff joints every morning or if I sit too long in the same place, but can overcome this with a hot shower, cup of tea and exercise. It's best to push through the fatigue with exercise. Just a 15 -20 minute walk does the trick or just keep moving. I find the stiff joints change from week to week. It's very strange sometimes it's my feet and hands or hips and shoulders or my lower back. As I said I'm feeling great most of the time. I work full time and lead a normal life. Thank you, Femara, Xgeva and Zoladex!",

I too have only 2 small liver mets and hope that they can be blasted. I haven't had any chemo or rads only hormone therapy. I feel your pain, but I know it's a waste of time to draw on the negatives. I try to surround myself with POSITIVE VIBES, but sometimes it's hard. I look at my children and my eyes fill with tears sometimes... silly, but true. I plan to be around a LOOOONG time. Those statistics are only that, STATISTICS! Big hug for you, CoolBreeze! ",
