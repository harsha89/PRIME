The good news is the surgeon feels that he got all of the cancer!  We will see the oncologist tomorrow but the surgeon feels that she won't need any further treatment. I am thankful for that. cgraham",

She is clinging to her independence but I am realizing that she probably shouldn't be alone.  To add to the difficulty she has no money and is state dependent. When she has her surgery I will be there 24/7.  She hides her memory loss very well. She just wants the cancer out of her.  She doesn't want treatment or any recontructive surgery.  The Dr said that all she would have is radiation if necessary and no recontruction. C",
