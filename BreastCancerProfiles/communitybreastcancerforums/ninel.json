It turns out that 4 separate doctors recommended that I do not need radiation. I had neoadjuvant chemo and I had my bilat mastectomy with expanders on Dec 17th. They took out 12 nodes and the path report came back all clear. It seems that the chemo killed ALL the cancer. Ninel",

I started working again so I don't know if these headaches are stress related or weather related (I live in muggy , hot, humid florida) or am I just giving myself these headaches because I am constantly thinking and stressing about this. What kind of headaches do you get with brain metastisis? Are they sharp or dull? Are they constant on a daily basis or is it every once in a while? I read up on the symptoms and I don't have seizures or any other symptoms aside from headaches.
