I do really like Dr. Aggon at DCMH - she was at Fox-Chase and now heads up the Breast Health Center at DCMH and the program seems very coordinated and friendly and knowledgeable - they already set up appts for me with genetics, radiation and oncology for the next week. I did go ahead and get a appt with Penn for a second surgical opinion....though they can't see me for almost 2 weeks....bc it seems like there is no reason not to...but sometimes I think being a big fish in a small pond is better, KWIM!?! I have found this site and community so helpful already - lots of huge thank yous and hugs!",

      "Content": "jarpsyd wrote: Hi, I had a routine mammogram that showed two areas of microcalcifications, which were determined after further images to warrant biopsy. The biopsies came back yesterday with DCIS/ ICS stage 1 (one area is within the duct walls, the other area has breached the duct walls). The receptor info is not back yet. The two area are about 3cms apart in a line under my nipple heading toward the chest wall. At this point, that is all I know...and that I need to choose between a lumpectomy and mastectomy ... and that I have appointments with the chemo and the radiation and the genetic testing people...I have no family history of BC though some other cancers in older adults in my extended family ... I have no other health problems. My overarching question at this point is whether I stick with the team I was assigned when my mammogram came back funky - Dr. Aggon at DCMH/Drexel Hill, PA - who I have really liked and has a good reputation I think - or do I get in line at Penn (the best-know cancer hospital in the area) for treatment there? And how do I make that decision? I just want to get going on treatment - but I don't want to regret anything either.... Thanks for any insights!
