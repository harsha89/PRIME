Last year still on taxotere so you can imagine how great I felt flying to Virginia to visit son and fianc√©. Our daughter and her boyfriend went also. I took lots of naps. This year, feeling the \"my last Christmas\" push in the back of my mind, I've been slowly preparing for weeks. Even had the chimney sweep out...except it was 65 degrees. My son and his wife were here from Virginia and daughter and boyfriend also. We saw Star Wars, ate at a Brazilian Steak House, played a naughty card game, drank some marvelous wine. Hubby's family came for Christmas lunch and we used the lovely Christmas China. Everyone raved about the food and afterwards I had to admit the mashed potatoes were from Sams with butter and 1/2&1/2 added. No peeling for me! Lol. Great visiting and lots of fun. It was a lot of effort but worth it. My sweet hubby and daughter did all of the hand washing of the China while I escaped to the bed. So now I guess it will be left to see if I post again next year. I've already told my husband that I'm not going to lose my hair again. It's not that I'm cute...its just too hard. Looking in the mirror and not seeing me. I'm going to talk to oncologist about dropping perjeta and see if cramping and muscle and joint pain are any better. Love to all and I've really enjoyed all if these stories",

The breast surgeon will also recommend someone. But, remember, lots of people get 2 opinions.

It is not really attached anymore, pulls out extremely easily, no pain etc. but just touching it doesn't work. I've actually used a lint roller which worked fairly well. But of course there are thousands of them.. The little hairs are sharp and stick to my head coverings and wigs. I've been afraid to use anything like Nair....afraid my head my break out. I'm ready for completely bald. Anyone with advice? Thanks",

I was just a little nervous having been an RN for 40'years. An RN that I had worked with and respected did my first chemo which made it a great experience. With most of the drugs, it seems to take a day or two until you feel your worst. Take the medications given to you by your Doc before you feel terrible...head it off at the pass. Like I said, no fun, but it is doable for most of us. If you think you need to call the Dr., do it. Follow your gut instincts. We all have a steep learning curve with this chemo crap. ",

Is there not a breast surgeon at your hospital rather than a general surgery? And do you know who will place your port, you want to make sure they have done a lot of them. Not to be scary even more than you are, but if they have found a remote tumor in your occipital area...most do not have breast removal first and some never, .just big chemo. The thought is that the horse is already out of the barn and let the chemo kill it out. Most get started within a month on some type of treatment. You will find many recommendations to start an anti anxiety during this waiting period. Some ladies start meditation. Hopefully you do not have a remote tumor and can get doing on all of this as soon as possible. The waiting is part of the worst. We all like to get a plan and work the plan.

When your bone marrow is affected by chemo and not making like it should, it is hard to keep up the number of rbcs needed by our body and the daily die off can get ahead of the production.So having transfusions could last for awhile until your production is better. Of course, you need to be sure that you are not losing in your stool and that your iron levels are adequate, because you can't make blood without adequate iron stores.",
