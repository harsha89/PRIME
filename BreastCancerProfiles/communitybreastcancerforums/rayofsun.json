It did not get better and would hurt at night and was extremely painful. needless to say I was scared.I saw an ortho who did an xray which showed nothing and then I saw my onc who ordered a pet scan, they wanted an mri too but I could not because I had expanders then. The scans came back good and eventually it was decided I had a bakers cyst and some arthritis.  I go thru periods of thinking my cancer will return but these are usually short lived. It does not matter how much support you have, I believe cancer is very personailized and no 2 people share the same journey and it can be lonely. When I get to those lonely times I also try to make them short lived. Ray ",

The PT met me pre surgery and wrapped my arm which did well thru sugery.Before they called me to the OR i went to the bathroom myself and looked at my boobs one last time and said a prayer. I got very tearful right after I kissed my husband and going into the OR. There was this one tech who held my hand until I fell asleep which helped.The procedure went well, was 5 hrs but was in recovery 5 hrs cause my heart rate was up and i was very groggy.My sister stayed the night. I went home early the next afternoon on perocet 2 tabs which i decreased to one because i was restless, today i am doing ibuprofen and percocet at night.I took my first shower saturday, i have 2 drains andsurgical glue on the incisions. I have been sleeping well in bed with a bed wedge and plenty of pillows. Been keeping up with my exercises and they seem to help with pain and tightness issues. So thats where things are with me. Sending everyone my best. ray",

I had fluid build up and had it removed from the PS on both sides, first I got my first fill which I did not feel at all going in and then was drained. I could feel the fluid being pulled out, did not hurt but was a weird sensation. I was told I can start wearing sports bras which i am, I wore and wear the compression bra but find the camisole I was given to be too hot. I see my PT on friday, seesm like the lymphedema I was having is staying under control now. ray",
