      "Content": "Nov 3, 2016 05:00PM - edited Nov 3, 2016 05:02PM by natster Hey November friends! I'm TPN. I started AC on 11/1. I did 2 rounds of irinotecan + parp inhbitor (I am in a trial), but it wasn't working so my docs switched me. I found this out on 10/31 and was in the infusion at 8am on 11/1. I was really super freaked out about AC. The infusion went well. I don't have a port; I'm doing IV. I'll do 4 cycles over 8 weeks and then likely taxol. Right now I'm taking Prilosec, Clairitin, Zofran and Dexamethasone. I didn't feel bad on 11/1 or 11/2. A little tired, but nothing much. Neulasta on-pro was fine. Today, I'm a little more nauseous. Main SE is constipation. I drink a ton of water, have taken miralax 2x, yet no BM. Oh the joys. Hoping things will get moving by tomorrow morning! Anyone drinking coffee? I'm not planning on doing wigs. I'm in Chicago and with winter coming I think I'm going to go for hats/scarves/etc. Aside from that I'm trying to enjoy the Cubs while figuring this all out. I have 2 boys (6 & 8), so it's been a trip. Staying positive and moving forward. xoxo to all. ",

U of C's billing system was down so that made EVERYTHING slow because all the orders had to be done manually. I was supposed to start at 1pm but didn't get going until 345pm. Ugh. Regardless, it was pretty uneventful. I sucked on Ginger Gummies during the pushes (I didn't do this last time) and I think it really helped! Much less yucky taste today. I was up every 2 hours to pee, which is good (my MO said to set an alarm during sleep to pee to make sure that I go no longer than 3 hours (at night) or 2 during the day for the first 24 hours). Had totally disgusting night sweats. So gross, but I guess that means my body is moving this stuff thru. My hair is starting to really come out. My shower yesterday was quite eventful. So, tonight we're getting the clippers out. No highlights and haircuts for at least a year, right? Red Devil just reminds me that I'm like a cooking turkey. They get the basters out and they shove that juice and gravy right in there. BG46TN I do not have a port and I'm TN. Initially, I was supposed to get 14 treatments (10 of an investigationals + 4AC) but the investigational didn't work on me. It did for others. So, now I'm 4 AC + 12 Taxol. I wouldn't be surprised if I get a port because my veins are little/roll/etc. I'll let you know. My doctor likes to start without them, but yesterday I had to have 2 IVs because the first wouldn't get a blood return. OK, keep me posted all! Anyone want to do a FB group? I'd be up!!!",
