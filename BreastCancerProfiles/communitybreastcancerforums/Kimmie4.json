I opted for chemo first to try to shrink the tumor in case I opted for lumpectomy. My gut feeling is BMX. I had a grandmother, aunt and sis all with MX. Again, I am BRCA neg. I believe my oncologist thinks that I have lost my mind to be so invasive. Thank you for the reminder that there is no right or wrong answer.  I worry about recurrance to a radiated breast not to mention how it will look after radiation.After BMX, do you still have to take Tamox? I am post menopausal, so I would take Arimidex.  ",

I am BRCA neg but my sis passed away in 2002 from mets bc. which weights heavily on me.  I will have my 4th chemo treatment soon and will need to make the decision of which surgery to go with. Truthfully, both options scare me. Wish I could stick my head in the dirt, but since that's not an option - I'll keep reading your posts.  Thanks to all for sharing!",
