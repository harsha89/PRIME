I buy alot of Ann Taylor for work and so I've bought several button-front tops in one size below what I wore previously. However, with the sweaters, I went from an XL to a Medium because most of the sizing was for the front bust area, which now no longer exists on me. I now also look much better in a business jacket. I thought I'd be scared of how I looked and I definitely don't like anything for work that is so snug that you can see the concaveness of my chest. But I have found quite alot of combination of work clothes that look really good on me, and as my mother says now, I look alot thinner without my large bust. lol",
