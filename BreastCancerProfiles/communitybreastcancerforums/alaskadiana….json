      "Content": "Sep 28, 2011 02:22PM - edited Sep 28, 2011 02:27PM by alaskadiana My experience was very similar to GiGiL's, almost line for line.  And, yes, Xanax really helped.  It took the cutting edge off the fear.  And as far as being cranky, I think this experience very suddenly reminds you what is important in life, and then all the little BS gets really irritating.  Coworkers and others who aren't supportive can also remind you that it may be time to \"weed the garden of your life,\" if you know what I mean.  Some folks are keepers and some aren't.  But some folks mean well and just say the wrong things.  They think they can take away your fear by telling you why you shouldn't feel it, but that's wrong, even if well-intended.  If I can make a couple suggestions ... after your meds, etc. wear off be sure to support your affected breast (with your arm) if you're on bumpy roads.  We had to drive 3 hours home the day after my surgery (Alaska) and we hit several potholes that made me cry -- and I don't cry easily!  My husband started driving around every pothole (and that was kind of funny) but it was worth it!  2nd, while you are healing, wear a bra that ensures you have no tension whatsoever on your incision.  The less tension you put on it while you heal, the thinner the scar will be.  Just the nature of our breasts trying to hang downward can be enough to make some scars get a little wider.  I kept \"my Girl\" well lifted for a couple months and my scar is so thin it's barely noticeable.  And you know what?  I don't hate my scar; it's my secret, hidden badge of courage, and reminds me that I walked through this. And as far a hubbies go, there was some awesome advice given to me in the last few days by folks commenting on \"Scared, alone, waiting for results.\"  We have some really cool, insightful women on this site; and their comments helped lower my fears by a HUGE amount (while waiting for biopsy results), esp. in wee hours when things got really scary.  So KNOW that you have lots of folks to help see you through -- it's a whole crowd of support! ",
