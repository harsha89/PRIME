Summary:  Complex mass with blood flow approximating 2.6 cm x 1.6 cm corresponding with palpable mass in the 6 o'clock position in the left breast.  Can anyone explain what some of this means?  What makes a mass complex?  And is it bad that it has blood flow to it? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",

I spent most of the afternoon getting mammos and ultrasounds, and talked to the doctor also who did say I would need a biopsy.  I have a core needle biopsy scheduled for next Thursday for that lump.  And they found some worrisome areas on my right breast (thickening tissue and a possible cyst) that they want to recheck in 6 months.  So now I just have to wait on the biopsy results, but I do feel so much better having some answers and being informed. ",
