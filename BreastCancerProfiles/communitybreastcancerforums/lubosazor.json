I don't carry my patients file with me and it is customary to get an appointment with your \"main\" general doctor (who is back home). So I can't really get in touch with a doctor sooner. I read about how low is the chance that it is cancer in my case, but I need reassuring so I can continue with my study. I know there is always a little chance it is cancer but thank you for saying at least that the chance, according to my age and bilaterality, it is unlikely. Still I'm going to see the doctor after these 2 weeks for sure and keep a watchful eye on any changes. ",

I can't see them in the mirror they are only touchable not visible. And they are pretty close to the areola, I'd say 0,5cm. ",

I am very afraid and trying to find out if it could by any chance be cancer. Next time I can see my general doctor is in 2 weeks and I have my state exams now and I basically can't learn anything from the fear of these lumps. None of those lumps seems to be larger than 5mm. I feel no pain when touching them, no pain in the breast, no outside changes. Is there any chance someone can say some positive words ? :(  Log in to post a reply",

The campus is rather small and the collage buildings are spread in the city.  Well not to ease my state, before I went back to collage, like 2 weeks ago when I was home, I was diagnosed with GERD, so I'm on PPIs and diet. So no coffee or tea with higher caffeine content for me... (among other things) To complete my state I was also on ultrasound back home and they found some kind of little thickening on my little intestine, near my belly button, no one yet explained what it is.  I know I'm going off topic... but you can imagine how I felt when I found these additional lumps in my breast. Why at this point of my life when I need to concentrate the most... Well all I can do is to try and keep a cool head about all this and have multitude of medical examinations after my state exams (no celebrations for me either). ",
