    "Content": "Dec 19, 2014 11:03PM - edited Dec 20, 2014 12:13AM by LydiaHouse having a hard time wrapping my head around brain met. Just diagnosed yesterday and its the size of a golf ball. They haven't even given me aa actual size. My family is imploding.the body scan was clear and MRI shows only the one tumor, but I'm petrified. Having the tumor removed on monday and it is in a good place as they say. Relatively easy to remove. After this I'm just to go to radiation. No meds for triple neg brain tumor... it seems so strange. I,m wigging out here. My husband has been wonderful, but everyone is so tired. I'm so scared. I haven't read about anyone who actually h$ brain surgery to remove tumors. This must be a very bad sign.  ",
