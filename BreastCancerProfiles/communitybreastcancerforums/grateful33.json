Thank you for telling me that I am not a sissy! That really helped me. Sometimes I feel so \"weak\" compared to everyone else. Never felt that way before as I am usually so independent and strong.

I have been catching up on the posts and I feel for everyone having bad days on the Taxol. I wish we could all get together for one big group hug. I was supposed to have #2 dd Taxol last Thurs, but on Wed developed severe ataxia and inability to walk or balance at all. Had to walk holding on to walls or someone for fear of falling. Saw my MO that day worried it may be neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system. MO was also worried and we discussed switching to Taxotere if symptoms had not abated in a week. So today I am 80% better and go for #2 dd Taxol tomorrow. It was scary! Can't believe I have to pour more of this s*#t into my body!  Three more dd's to be exact. But then the alternative is potential future mets and I think that scares all of us the most! Like Annie and Jenn- I don't know how I can make it through to the end. Some days I do see the light at the end of the tunnel and on the bad days it seems like forever.  Thank God I can post on here and vent.

Diane- I know your willpower will return as will mine (before our hair returns I'm sure- I am completely bald now) We will hold on to each other through this all Denise-great advice from your onc. Thank you for sharing this. I do find that acknowledging the feelings of being low and being able to share them are so diffficult. Don't want DH and family to think I've given up but during moments when I feel like \"I can't do this anymore\"    I don't want to express this to them and cause them pain Thanks to all of you for being here (although I wish none of you had to share this with me) Miniwheat - so happy to hear no hepatitis :)",

Could not stay in one position for longer than a minute or two. Couldn't weight bear/walk on my own- needed DH's help to go to the bathroom. I also made due with Tylenol only. I am improved this morning (PST noon here) but still have pain. I was really really scared of this as I read ahead on the Taxol forums and discovered some women had excruciating pain. My thoughts are with you for speedy resolution of the pain. Hugs Diane- hope your SE's are minimal this time Carol- good luck on your treatment tomorrow.  I hate the anxiety of the day before.",

I am awaiting surgery Dec 14 for lumpectomy and complete ALND (which has me freaked out). I had a lymph node biopsy which was positive. Apparently the lymph node is deep, so I will be having level I, II and partial III dissection. I will also eventually have chemo and rads. Just came back from seeing the oncologist today. Thanks for all the support-your thoughts are helpful!",
