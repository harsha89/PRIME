We are now waiting for the results of the test. Understandably, we are concerned about chemo. Since it is only stage 1, and if the tumor was removed as well as the lymph nodes, do we need to undertake chemo? Can someone pls share additional insights?  When the test results are out, what all data points we need to ask if we should/should not undertake chemo? I understand that the risks/benefits should be weighed.. Appreciate your help in advance. Log in to post a reply",
