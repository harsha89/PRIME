My 5 yr MRI bilateral breast shows several \"oil cysts\"  along with an irregular shaped node under left armpit area,that they now want to ultrasound. I had a failed DIEP last yr with a 2 unit blood loss & horrific infection, needing debridement on that L side. Is it just left over from that ??? Has anyone else had anything like this show up on an MRI ?? I'm calling in the morning to make another US appointment :( Thanks for any input. Sharon F. Log in to post a reply",

I'm thinking this irregular shaped node is just part of that whole thing, too. We'll see on 3/3. Thanks again, Sharon F",
