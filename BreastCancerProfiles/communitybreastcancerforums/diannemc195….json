I am a little worried about the knot.. but think I am going to wait since both Doctor and Surgeon didn't seem to think it was anything to be concerned about..... I have a checkup in 3 months with my surgeon..if it is still there I will probably want to have it removed.. but ifit changes any before I am going to have it removed then for sure....this is just all so scary!!!",

I was put on anastrozole and took it for a month and started to get really bad hot flashes and real moody and anxious.I called the doctor and he changed it to exemestane.. it all got worst so after two months I could not do it anymore...Now I am scared that the cancer will come back.. Had to go on zoloft for the depression...Has anyone decided not to take estrogen blockers? Are there anything else I could do??? I go back to doctor in a couple of weeks.",
