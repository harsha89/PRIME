I felt a lump during AUg, went to my former gyno for a check-up, she told me it was just dense breast tissue so I put off my mammo for two months.  My 1.8cm grade 1 tumor was found on my routine mammo.  michcon, my dr. also told me not to use cream unless I get red so I also am not doing the preventative thing.  I noticed that some docs say take the herceptin while undergoing RADS and others say to wait until after RADS.  What is everyone doing?  DUring or after for the meds?",

I hope everyone is progressing though their RADS the best they can.  I have really found that applying the Aquafor really helps.  I lather it on every night after I shower.  My Radonc told me to se regular corn starch when I am itchy.  That works great.  I look forward to buyi a few new nightgowns when the RADS are over because they are all ruined from the aquaphor!   Sherry, Maybe try the corn starch to keep the area dry.  Hope your blisters heal soon.  Seems like your onc is right on top of everything and there to give you what you need.   Thanks for starting this thread Suepen, It's nice to connect with others going through the same things.  Good thoughts for everyone.",

You have enough to deal with without having anyone add any negativity.  Yes, you want to hear the latest statistics, but you certainly don't need her to make you feel like you should be planning your funeral instead of your recovery.",
