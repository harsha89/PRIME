I think the book really helped him. Not being a talker, he didn't say much about it except that it had some unexpected humor that surprised him, which he appreciated. My sister who lives on the other coast has been very supportive and a friend who lives close by.  I guess we have to find out who we can lean on and who isn't afraid. ",
