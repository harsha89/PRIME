    "Content": "nouly wrote: Had a surgical biopsy and was diagnosed with atypical lobular hyperplasia - benign.  i've gotten a second opinion to verify the pathology and both drs are strongly recommending tamoxifen. i'm considering it more now but still very concerned about taking it.   both drs are also not sure that i should rush to get an MRI as they think it would only lead to another biopsy as they would likely find other areas with ALH.   i'm so confused on what the best decision is for me.  if i wait and forego the MRI until 6 mos post-biopsy, and if they missed cancer in the mammo, i'm 6 mos behind the game in treatment.  if i do the MRI in the next month or two and they see something that is indeterminate again, i'm looking at another biopsy.  what if they see something in both breasts?  do they biopsy both areas?  for how long does one go through this before saying enough and opting for a PBM?    Log in to post a reply",
