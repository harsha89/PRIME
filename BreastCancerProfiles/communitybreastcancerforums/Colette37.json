The reality is that for women who are in a high risk group, that a mammogram is the only way to help detect breast cancer at this time that the insurances are willing to pay for at this time...at least most insurances. I was in a high risk group (because of lifestyle and also my mother having had breast cancer at a young age).  I was literally IGNORED when I turned 35  and asked about wanting a mammogram and told to start asking about it when I turned 40!  Well, I am now 37 with a 10 cm tumor that would have been seen 2 years ago and was denied the request to have a mammogram or any other testing for that matter!  How can I say that it would ahve been seen without a doubt?  Because mammograms can see the size of a pea and for the cancer to have to to the size that it was, I would have had to have had it between 4 to 6 year minimum!  The tumor was seen on my mammogram and MRI to have been 9.5 cm in March/April.  When I had the tumor removed it was 10 cm.  (Please keep in mind that I needed to find a hospital who knew what they were doing and how to read the films correctly because I have 4 different sizes reported from looking at the same films!  It was 1.7 cm, 3.5 cm, 5-6 cm and 9 1/2...it was only until the last place that they knew what they were looking at and gave an accurate size to what was being seen) What I want to know is why insurances REFUSE to pay for other tests which are better at dedtecting cancer in high risk patients and why Dr. are not trying to set up a better standard of care since more and more young women are developing breast cancer. I wish that I would have had a chance to have a mammogram 2 years ago...it would have saved a LOT of the treatment that I am now having to have just to survive. There IS nothing that women can do to force Insurances to support doing the testing such as MRIs.  You STILL need a Dr. to order the test even if you are willing to pay out of pocket for it.  That is even with the Mammogram. You know what the worst part about my care?  It was the Veteran's Hospital that did it to me.  Nice huh?",

I am going to tell you something, that I hope doesn't scare you, but hopefully the nurses will stay close by you when you get your Taxotere.  On May 4th I had my 2nd chemo.  They started the Taxotere and then basicially left me without watching me at all.  Well, within 5 minutes, I started to get sick to my stomach, very bad...I yelled it out to the nurse across from me..I know I had to say it twice and the look the nurse gave me freaked me out.  She yelled to the other nurses (it was lunch time) that we were having a reaction.  With in a few seconds I was in full anaphalatic shock to where they stopped the medicine and started giving me massive amounts of benadryl and prednisone to reverse it.  They wrote on the notes that my face was scarlet in color and that it was starting to swell.  I had never been so scared in my intire life as I was then.  They let me rest for a bout a 1/2 to get better...then they started the treatment with the other chemo drugs.  Since this incedent I have not been having any rashes nor acne.  The Dr. is changing me to Abraxane which is the same except the delivery is different so it is easier to tollerate  and most people are not allergic to it. I hope that I helped you and didn't scare you..just be aware about how you are feeling expecially for the first 5 to 10 minutes and make sure that a nurse is with you and you wont get as far as I was.

I am SO thankful for the drain that I do have because my PS tried getting fluid for a culture and couldn't with a needle because the drain was working so well...which is a GREAT thing because it is a way that my body can get rid of the excess fluid and infection.   They are a pain, but once you figure out how to deal with them they are very positive. The cami that I wore you could just pin the drain bulbs at the bottom of them.  I also have a 'necklace' that was made for me out of the nasal cannula that they have for O2 that was fashioned for me when I had my bilateral MX.  You will not want them just to hang without any support because they are only tied on with a suture. Trust me, you don't want them to come out pre-maturely.  I have become so protective of my last drain that I actually TAPE the drain to my skin so there isn't any pulling on the suture.  I had one in my back that came out early because I pulled on it when I was sleeping...You DON'T want that happening. You will come home with 2 drains, one on each side. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about them, because I feel like I have lived through everything that they could do about drains!",

The Pacific NW has increased risk of BC, and BC has started happening to younger and younger women.  They know that for a fact.  There was a 10 year old who was diagnosed with BC BEFORE puberty!  My guess it is all the 'stuff' that they keep putting in our foods and atmosphere...all of the estrogen mimicking cr*p that makes our hormones go wacko. The point of where Dr. want to start seeing and doing testing of children of women who have breast cancer is 10 years prior to the mother's diagnosis.  This sounds disheartening, but there are many things that you can do to help with their breast health. 1. Make sure they are on a low fat..high fresh fruits and vegetable diet. 2. Check out the Vitamin D..it is an amazing vitamin that helps SO much..it helps many different kind of cancers..not just for strong bones. 3. Help them enjoy being active. 4. Decrease High Fructose Corn Syrup and MSG...They are food additives that make your body go out of whack or makes your body think you are still hungry when you are not. 5.

Sopris...I agree with you about as long as I show up for treatment, that is positive enough for me.  I do get saddened because of how much I have to sleep and how many naps I take...I have 3 kids (9, 5, and a 1 year old) so it is hard to totally let Daddy take care of them...although he is a great Dad, I know he gets tired responding to them 24/7.  I can't even really carry the toddler any longer because with the skin peeling if she grabs me the wrong way can cause a LOT of damage.",

Anyway..about me.  I didn't have rads yesterday.  I was so angry yesterday evening, that I got my shoes on and went for a walk...to where my husband called my cell worried about me.  He point blank told me that he was coming to get me because he didn't want me walking in the dark and was worried about me.  He was upset with what the nurse said too.  So, today I went in knowing that I would be seeing the Dr.   My husband point blank said that he was coming with me and we would have to bring the kids (the hospitals around here are freaking out about swine flu and have pandemic signs everywhere and don't want kids in the hospital)  He point blank said that if they don't let him come in then we would leave...of course it didn't come to that and everyone understood.  The receptionist was ticked that the nurse said what she did and even watched Phoebe (my 1 year old) while we took the boys back with the Dr!  She is a sweetheart anyway.  When we went back to see the Dr. the nurse was amazingly polite (my hubby though she looks like she was a rude person by the air she had with her).  The Radiation Oncologist was asking about my scrubbing my skin (which I never did) and I explained, I didn't know how to get the Silverdene off because it clumped so badly..we also explained about the honey and that it wasn't the regular honey.  Anyway, the Dr. felt that it was THEIR fault for not explaining about the stuff better.  He then said I should have the rest of the week off.  I told him that I couldn't and that if I stopped it would be the end because William needs to go back to work.  I asked him if I could just continue and he said yes and that I would burn more, which I know, but that is something I will live with.  My skin looks so bad that when I was getting my first boost today one tech asked the  other if they were going to mark me with a marker  and she looked at him like he was crazy and said, \"I am not going to touch that skin..YOU can if you want but I am not!\"  It is not taking much for the skin to just sluff off and leave the red weeping sores. I swore that if I ever got this bad, I would just stop the treatment...and then I found out what stage I was in.  I couldn't live with myself if I had stopped and it came back..I would feel like I let my husband and kids down and that I didn't do everything in my power to get rid of it. So, that was how my day went!  I am tired and sore, but one more day done!",

I have to add that I am worried about being sick with the flu too after going through all that we have in the past few months.  I have 3 kids...9, 5, and 1...so that is an added worry for me.  My PCP only had the nasal vaccine, which has the live virus, that we can't have or be around anyone who has had it. I have turned red, but no weaping as of yet and I am hoping that I don't.  I am worried about the \"Boost\" because I have the mast. scar that I am worried about breaking down. Although I have had nausea from the get go,  they kept trying to deny that it was them...they have been blunt that I will burn and become sore with the rads and they have also talked about the shooting pains, which I am now getting.  What bothers me the most is as they are giving the rads I get the shooting pain which feels like a stabbing in my left chest.  Even though I have not had any positive lymph nodes, they are doing all my nodes because of the size of the cancer (10 cm) and the fact that I had an internal node light up on the bone scan in my breast bone area. I hate rads and I hate when they are zapping me.  I feel like I want to jump up and say \"ENOUGH!\" I end up taking a xanax before going there because I hate it so much.  The whole idea of cooking me just to kill the cancer freaks me out. I do have a wonderful husband who has been there from day one.  I would never have made it this far without him. Sopris..I haven't had any problems with my range of motion, but since starting rads it has gotten tighter and tighter...they say it is just the skin, but I doubt that. I have to admit, I am also irritated that the person who is seen directly after me comes in the dressing room with her husband because she is in a wheel chair..that part doesn't bother me that bad..but what is really irritating is that I don't feel well anyway and they are obvious smokers which even makes me feel that much more sick!  It is 10 times worse than the heavy perfume people!",
