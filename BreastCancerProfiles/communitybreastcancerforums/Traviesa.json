At night I start to change mi braa and to take away but the pain still its there. My breast it's still sensitive and I don't know how long I have to wait to go to a doctor or to take an exam. Because usually the doctor will be do the same touch test I do. I do not feel anythig. Also I have breast implants on top of the muscle and under mamarian glands, but the sensitive area is only at the skin. Do I have to do a biopsy?? traviesa Log in to post a reply",
