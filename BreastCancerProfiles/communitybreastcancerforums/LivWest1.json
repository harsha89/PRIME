I seem to have Paeu d' orange going up my chest wall and branching out in between both breasts at the very bottom. I do have implants and just stopped breastfeeding 3 months ago. There's peau d' orange on both breasts as well but not red. Only in the middle of my chest its red. Is this even a symptom? I've heard that it more then likely only affects one breast. I have swollen lymph nodes under both armpits, but that could very well be from me checking constantly. Log in to post a reply",
