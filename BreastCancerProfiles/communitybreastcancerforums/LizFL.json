      "Content": "Sep 7, 2008 12:37AM - edited Sep 7, 2008 12:38AM by LizFL I faithfully went for mammograms every year.  Had a history of cysts and dense breasts and usually had an ultra sound along with the mammo.  Six months after a normal mammo/us I was diagnosed with BC at stage 3C, borderline 4 and grade 3.  I did not feel a lump, just some soreness on the side of my breast that didn't go away and the skin developed a reddish color so I made an appointment to have it checked out.  I was so sure that even it did turn out to be cancer that I would be catching it very early....wrong again!  The good news is that was over three years ago and I am sitll NED.  I am due for a mammo in October and plan on requesting an MRI.  Hopefully I won't have probems with my insurance company.
