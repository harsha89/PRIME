My right breast has micro invasive DCIS. The ultrasound report on the mass on both breasts measures 2 cm but MRI showed an abnormal enhancement of about 4.5 cm on the right and 3cm on the left breast. I have not seen an oncologist or a radiologist except for the endocrinologist/breast surgeon and plastic surgeon that I mentioned in my earlier post. When do I see the oncologist? Who will tell me that I need to see an oncologist? I'm waiting to see the doctor for second opinion and then we will decide.",

I've seen a plastic surgeon who recommends an implant with TE. I have a schedule to see another breast specialist from Memorial Sloan Kettering on 02/29/16 for a second opinion. What if this 2nd doctor give a different treatment? Should I go to him? My current surgeon's specialization is Endocrinology and Breast Surgery. I want to just get this over with. Would lumpectomy be better off than mastectomy? Please share your experience ... thank you.
