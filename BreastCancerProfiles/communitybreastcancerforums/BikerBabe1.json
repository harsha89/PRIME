      "Content": "Feb 19, 2012 08:59PM BikerBabe1 wrote: I think this is an important discussion.  I don't have the answer but I do know that for me, it has been a fine line between acting on my gut based upon reasonable information vs. acting on my gut based on fear.   Here is my experience with the recommendation of waiting and coming to terms with whether my gut or my doctor's recommendations should prevail. In December 2010, I was diagnosed with DCIS and had a UMX.  I have had several  surgeries and in November had a follow up MRI.  The MRI showed a small (less than a cm) growth on my sternum, which apparently had been there at my last MRI the year before.  The Rad. Dr. ordered a follow-up CT but preliminarily stated that it looked like a benign hemangianoma.  Well, I went to the worst case scenario that it was some form of mets, researching and researching and initially believing that a biopsy would be the only solution that I would settle for.  The CT confirmed that it was the benign tumor given some very specific characteristics seen on the CT.  Because it had been stable for more than a year, both the rad. dr. and my onc recommended a follow up MRI in a year (which I would having regardless, for surveillance purposes).  At first I was like NO WAY, I want to definitively know by biopsy.  But eventually, I went with the doctors' recommendation.   What was most important for me in making this decision was, as Beesie stated, making sure that I was informed and that options were thoroughly evaluated in the context of my diagnosis.  I did my part by researching this type of tumor and being prepared with my questions when I met with the Onc. I brought my daughter along.  I also gave myself permission to seek a second opinion or third opinion if necessary if I was was uncomfortable with the oncs recommendation.  I know for some people, going to another doctor can be hard to do.  For me, sometimes I hesitate about this because I don't want to \"hurt the doctor's feelings.\"  A good doctor will not have a problem with this and will sometimes encourage a second opinion. I was surprised that after all that, I was quite comfortable with the onc's recommendation given the following facts:  (1) my diagnosis was DCIS and not invasive, which, by definition, cannot metastasize; (2)  the lesion on the MRI had been stable over the last year; (3) the lesion on the MRI had the definitive characteristics of the benign tumor (which I had independently researched this) and (4) a biopsy of the sternum is not without risk and (5) there was no guarantee that with this size and type of growth, the biopsy would generate anything conclusive for purposes of diagnosis. Now, I know that only time will tell if this was the right decision for me but I have been able to proceed knowing that I made it with the best information available at the time.   This is not to say that a doctor who fails to follow the standard of care or respond reasonably to patient concerns and questions should not be held accountable. Nor is it in any way to imply that patients are to blame when they rely upon their doctor's recommendation and the doctor's recommendation turns out to have very serious consequences to the health of and prognosis for patient.   If a doctor makes a recommendation and a patient relies upon that recommendation to his or her detriment, the doctor should be held accountable.  ",

They were great about detailing the procedure and addressing my fears about the pain.  The procedure at this hospital (Swedish Hospital in Seattle) is to inject the lidocaine in first and then exchanging the syringe (leaving the needle in) they inject the SNB substance.  Leaving the needle in reduces the need for a second injection and apparently insures that when they inject the substance, they inject it exactly where the lidocaine has been dispersed.  The tech I talked to said that 95% of the patients don't feel the substance going in at all or very little pain.  She said on rare occasions, the substance may go beyond where the lidocaine has spread and patients report feeling a brief burning sensation.  She stated that patients reported that compared to the stereotactic biopsy, the injection was a piece of cake.  After reading through the thread regarding pain on the SNB injection  (which scared me), it seems that procedures vary from hospital to hospital--a small percentage of hospitals state that lidocaine may interfere with the SNB injections.  It would be important to find out whether the hospital uses lidocaine and if they don't, advocate that they address pain concerns.  On the SNB injection thread, several women mentioned studies that have concluded that lidocaine does not interfere with the SNB and have used them to advocate for the use of lidocaine for the injection process. While I feel at peace about my decision, I continue to take the anxiety about the surgery one day at a time.     ",
