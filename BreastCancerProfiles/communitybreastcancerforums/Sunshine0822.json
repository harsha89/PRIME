Even with doing research, I still feel quite ignorant on this overall subject of breast health.  I did read that a pailloma is benign, so that's great.  Here is where my concerns are (I will include some background info so that no one has to go back to the other thread.): 1.  When I initially went to the GP, it's because I felt the lump.  She told me that it was probably nothing since I'm 36 but ordered a mammogram.  From what I tried to figure out on the report, the lump could not be seen well on the mammogram and the report said that I have  a dense parenchymal breast pattern so a fine needle aspiration would be necessary. 2.  I went to the breast surgeon that Monday and he said because my nipple was inverted, an excisional biopsy was mandatory. I did not have any discharge, breast soreness or anything like that...just an inverted nipple. 3.  No other types of imaging studies were performed (ultrasound, MRI, etc.)...just straight to surgery a few days later. I guess my main concern now is...what could possibly lie beneath or within, even if this is a papilloma.  Should I request other imaging studies or will I be safe with whatever results come from the biopsy?  Cuz like I said, the report seems to say that they didn't get anything on the mammogram, not even the lump that could be felt.  When the tech was doing the mammogram, she said that she saw calcium deposits and the lump but the radiologist's report doesn't mention anything like that.
