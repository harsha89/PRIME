A few weeks out from last surgical biopsy, waiting for oncotype and BRCA tests to come back, so in a holding pattern for another week. Felt almost normal yesterday. Sun was shining, it was 30 degrees, ski trails groomed by neighbor, all the way to my yard. Was able to cross country ski and run 3 miles all in the same day! Felt amazing to enjoy the simple pleasures that I have so often taken for granted. PTL for cupcakes, family with which to share them; sunshine on a winter day, and the energy to run with it over my shoulder; groomed ski trails and the beloved friends and neighbors that share them; and most of all a gracious and loving God who gave us the mind, body, and spirit with which to experience them all! And thank God for strong women like you who come together to support each others as sisters!",

Mets in lymph node just at the border (2mm) of being considered micrometasteses vs a fully positive node. The fact that I had any cancer in node and am younger than 40 lead me to expect chemo. It seems crazy to \"want\" chemo when it may not be highly beneficial, but I can't shake that feeling. Had 2nd opinion and awaiting oncotype and BRCA results....hope to have more clarity then but worried I may have same dilemma. :-P",

That was clear. Just overly cautious as my first lump was presumed to be a benign fibroadenoma until it came back positive for IDC. It is so refreshing to see the posts from Stage 1 sisters on here. I have had moments of feeling like \"just a little breast cancer patient\"...like I don't have a legitimate reason to take this so seriously or be so consumed by something that is in an early stage and low grade. Sounds crazy but sometimes just need validation that I am not just dealing with a \"runny nose\" and have a legit reason to feel how I feel. You all are great!",
