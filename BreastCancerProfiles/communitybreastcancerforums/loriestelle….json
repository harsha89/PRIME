I had long, shiny brown hair before all of this. Now I just can't stand the way I look. People close to me think I should go through the \"process\". Did your extensions just blend right in so they weren't noticeable? Did they damage or break any new hair? I would literally get on a plane to Jon Richards as I can't find anyone in my area who has the experience with chemo patients.",
