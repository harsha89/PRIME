Piano Girl:  Before my surgery - we went and bought a recliner.  I tell ya - it has made sleeping very easy!!!  It seems as though my two young boys and hubby love it too!!  At this point I can't really imagine sleeping in the bed.  The fact that I can't roll over I think has saved me some pain.....and I have had great deep healing sleep.  I would highly recommend it!! What are you girls wearing for support while you are getting filled?  A cami with built in support seems to be working great for me.  I  heard that sports bras are a great option.  I tried that....and discovered that I got stuck in it trying to get it off!!!  Thank goodness I had help to get out of it!!!      ",

Back in 2008 I had breast reduction surgery and I was pretty happy with my breast after that.  I often wonder if messing around in my chest back in 2008 had something to do with the cancer showing up.  What are your opinions on this?",
