      "Content": "busymom3 wrote: Decided to post after reading several discussions I stumbled upon after stupidly googling my symptoms.  Any how about 3-4 weeks ago I started noticing pain in my left breast behind my nipple.  I have breastfed all 3 of my children weaning my youngest about 2 yrs ago. I described my pain as what it felt like when I had mastitis.  Achy heavy pain like if I press on my nipple milk would/ should come out but it doesn't.  I have had breast cysts diagnosed on ultrasound a few years ago. I do breast exams but did not feel anything other than the normal lumpy bumpy texture I normally feel.  Nor did my OBGYN. She scheduled me for a mammo and sonogram anyway because of the pain. I had that yesterday a week and a day after I was in the office.  In mean time my pain changed it started radiating up toward my collarbone and eventually was primarily felt below ( as in south of not actually underneath) of my collarbone.  Also more like a burning like something hot was on my skin not hot to touch just the sensation.  I told this to the tech and radiologist they said the good news is they dont see anything on either the mammo or the sono bad news they dont know what the pain is from? Today I noticed the burning even more than I had been so when I got to my car I looked in my vanity mirror and noticed the area where I am hurting is all red like a flat simple rash. I took 600 of ibuprofen.  It didn't have much effect on the burning but seemed to lessen the redness.  When I looked in the bathroom mirror I just noticed almost red pimples over the burning site. I have a good friend who is a midwife she said I need to call and insist on seeing a breastcare specialist but if the mammo and sonno were negative yesterday I wonder if its not a breast issue.  Any advice or relatable experiences would be very welcomed.

I didn't have it when I was there but brought pictures of when I did experience it. She said I think you pulled a muscle just wait 2 more weeks and stop taking your vitamins if it's serious it wont go away.....kind of thought that was why I was seeking attention for my burning pain that wont go away?? I'm so confused I would almost bet my hand its not a pulled muscle, but I left  there feeling like a complete moron and like I should just keep my mouth shut until I literally cant stand the pain.......my PCP is awesome but I felt to stupid to call him. I think I've decided to just write done all my symptoms and responses to9 NDAIDS until he calls me back. He is really good at calling me after he schedules anything. For instance he called me today to tell me the XRay was ok. I figured it would be I knew I hadn't broken my clavicle. But I hadn't seen the derm when he called..just feeling frustrated Isabella61 Im so sorry you got that letter. I'm surprised your OBGYN wouldn't call you first. Can you call your doctor to ask why the request for comparison?  Also did you have your previous studies/mammograms at a different facility?  Because if not the comparison process shouldnt take long",

Good news however I was still having all the symptoms. He decided to treat me for shingles even though I never had the classic rash.  Its been about two weeks and the burning is getting less intense. Thank you all for the support as I was thinking I was crazy :) Best wishes to you all!!!",

( Im a nursing instructor and was there with students so I had good reason to be there lol). I saw her partner who suggested I call my PCP. I saw him at 4:30 he said he doesn't think its shingles he said it did by my description on the phone but does not have the clinical appearance. He sent me for an Xray and referred me to a dermatologist.  One of my good friends is the office nurse and said she will try to squeeze me in tomorrow. Thanks again for the response and I will keep you posted :)",
