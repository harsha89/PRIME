    "Content": "Hlo427 wrote: So at the beginning of April I had pain in my right nipple. It also looks different to me when erect. The pain went away after I saw my OB. The nipple looks identical to the other when normal but when cold or erect it appears flat. I had a mammo and ultrasound (39 years old) and both showed nothing. I have dense tissue. Next step is seeing a breast surgeon as follow up. I have no discharge or pain at all. Just looks flat when it shouldn't be and otherwise appears normal. Anyone experience this before? I am nervous.
