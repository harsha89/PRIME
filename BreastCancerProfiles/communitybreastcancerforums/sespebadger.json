The last AC didn't give me any more problems than the first 3. I remember worrying about that, just like you. I think your body must be getting a little more knocked down each time, but it's not more than you can handle. Take the pre-meds, or ask for some. Describe your symptoms to a nurse. I took 1 ativan (it's for anxiety) at bedtime to help me and also took 1 ativan before each infusion (until I got into Taxol and got over the fear of the infusions!). I found Taxol MUCH easier. I hope you do as well. I did have them adjust the steroid they gave with the Taxol as I had such a hard time getting to sleep the night of my Taxol infusion. Chemo is tough. Give yourself a break and don't expect to get as much done as you did before chemo. Give yourself time to recover afterward. It takes a while (maybe months, depending on what other treatment you will need), but you will. I was in chemo one year ago and I really worried about chemo brain. I am happy to report that my brain is fine today. I got two job offers last week, so that makes me feel great.   Good luck to you!",

The thing about going form free with just a tee-shirt that I am sensitive about is that I am not exactly flat, I am actually a bit concave. It's hard to explain, but I don't find it particularly attractive and this shape shows through a fitted t-shirt. I have two pairs of microbeads in two sizes (6s and 7s as I was formerly a D cup). I like the smaller ones and I think I might order some even smaller ones (like 4s and  5s) to wear this summer, just to have some shape with as little weight as possible during hot weather. I look just fine in clothes with the microbead forms and my husband, daughter and I are used to the way I look au natural. Good luck.",

I'm also Stage 3, and like you had chemo before this surgery and will have radiation after. (I also had surgery in Dec. of last year - lumpectomy and lymphectomy.) The radiation ahead is what makes me not want to chance the reconstruction with implants even though my radiologist said he had seen it work. Also I really am tired of being a patient and want to feel better as soon as possible so I can be more active. I am thinking I might do reconstruction with tissue in a few years when my daughter goes to college, or I may find I can live breast free, as they say. How about you and your decision? I see your surgery is just a few days away. I can't imagine how that feels, of course, but I'd guess it is scary. I wish you luck and hope that all goes well.   ",

The pathology report after the mastectomy showed that the main tumor had shrunk and that smaller areas of cancer in the breast had disappeared. We did chemo after lumpectomy not only to shrink tumor size in the breast but because I had cancer in some of my lymphnodes and the chemo was to kill any cancer cells that might have been roaming around in my body elsewhere. The good news on my pathology report makes me hopeful that we killed any other cancer cells too. I have no idea exactly how soon the chemo starts working, but it sure felt like it was doing something! I got through it though and would do it again in a heartbeat. I'm onto radiation now and will take tamoxifen next. I believe in the big guns in this fight against cancer.",

My chemo was a little more spread out than yours and let me be the first to say I think you you were extremely strong to go through that in a more condensed period of time and keep WORKING! I have been unemployed through this and grateful not to have that added stress. Anyway, I then had a BMX July 12. And then started rads end of August. Even though my doc said it would be easier than chemo, I DREADED more treatment and was scared of rads. I felt VERY tired after the first week and like you was very worried about how bad it would get. I still don't know exactly how bad it will get, but I am happy to report that after 19 of my 33 treaments I am sitting here with no pain, and I am not too tired to do what I want to do. No one knows how each of us will react to rads, but you may just be having a perfectly reasonable initial fear (that could cause fatigue) that may lessen with time. Also, the nurse at my radiation center said that usually side effects don't start bothering people until about treatment #20. I hope that will be the case with you. I've been using the aloe gel they gave me twice a day or sometimes more. I'm ready to ask for more help when that doesn't do the trick, and they assured me they could prescribe other things if I have pain, burning or itching.  The fatigue will probably arrive again, and I'll deal with that when I get there. Perhaps your nurse can give you advice to help you plan for your work. Good luck to you and know that those of us a bit ahead will keep reporting back and try to help whenever we can. And let us know if you have any more questions. We answer if we've had similar experiences. Welcome, Lorraine. I am very sorry you have to be away from home for your treatment, but I think you are smart to go for the very latest treatment for yourself. I'm wishing you the BEST. Bubbalu, I've been so sorry to hear of your difficulties with radiation. I know how much we want to fight this disease, and it must be very frustrating to not be able to continue with this treatment. I hope you find a good alternative. ",

I'll ask for something stronger, whether topical or a pain pill. I feel rather depressed about this as I wake up this morning, but will probably feel better as soon as I get distracted with day to day reponsibilities. Gotta get through this final stretch!! From reading how August radiation women did I think all this is typical. I've told my husband and daughter that these will be hard weeks for me. Tomorrow I go see my medical oncologist for blood test results. This will be the first report since chemo ended at the end of June. Hoping for a good report. If it's not good, my husband and I plan to keep the news to ourselves until after our niece's wedding (and a big family reunion) October 9. I have a close friend who has Stage 4 b.c. and she told me she doesn't tell her family when she is waiting for blood test results so that they don't have to wait and worry.This makes sense to me.",

I'll probably wear a bra with soft forms for a rehearsal dinner the day after I finish treatment.....I bet a glass of wine will help with the pain. It's different being flat, but nice and cool in this hot weather! I found some pretty, big earrings at Target this weekend and they help me feel like I still look like a woman. My woman oncologist admired my haircut.....I'm getting pretty good with scissors and a hand-held mirror. She said if I want to color it again (who me?) I should wait until 6 mos post chemo because the early growth hair is weaker and can fall out. I do not want to chance that so am rocking the \"silver\" look. :-) I'm definitely tired this week, but I'm finding that keeping busy is helpful. Good news: got results from 3-month post-chemo blood test. My tumor marker has come down to 17 and my onc says anything under 40 is good. I think this means that chemo killed anything wandering around and surgery and radiation have also done their job. Great relief.  Neither rad onc or med onc had much to say about the arthritis symptoms I am having, mostly in my thumbs but also in other finger joints, other than that I should keep an eye out for any lymphedema symptoms and attend an information meeting about Lymphedema. Also I could try Advil. I got my Tamoxifen prescription and will start two weeks after radiation is done. Was told to let doctor know if I experience swelling in my legs (blood clot risk) or unusal spotting (uterine cancer risk). Should expect hot flashes, but with chemo I am already familiar with those. Continued good luck to everyone as you get through treatment! ",

I took a generic Darvocet and it helped right away. I asked the nurse at the rad office today if I could get a new prescription (as I only have two pills left at home) and he said absolutely yes. I will take one at bedtime tonight and see if I need another midway through the night (you can take one every 4 hours). I share this story so you will keep track of your pain level and not get stuck without relief on a weekend. There's no need to suffer, in my opinion. My sore thumbs continue to be a problem at night but not during the day. I'm thinking the Darvocet will help with that. And I HOPE the thumb pain goes away after I'm done with radiation.",

I'm hoping I will feel so good to be healthy again I will quit thinking about it. I really only think about it when I lie in bed at night.

Some good news is that I flew from Los Angeles to Seattle at Thanksgiving and to Portland, OR at Christmas and had no problems. I had been concerned about lymphedema after BMX and rads, but nothing happened. That was a relief. Teka, I hope you can get a replacement bra soon. Sorry to hear about the hassle. Dawn, my BMX incisions don't hurt, but my port incision does. I figured it was because they did surgery there twice (placement and removal). It's been almost 6 months and is finally feeling better. It hurt mostly at night at bedtime. I found that rubbing it gently seemed to help. I'm sorry your incisionis painful. I am continuing to find it important to do gentle stretching exercises with my arms every day. My rad onc said women can tend to favor the arm on the radiated side and not use it, and that then they loose the full use of their arm. He also said that the incisions for a MX want to tighten up so we need to resist this with stretching. I can definitely feel tightness when I start stretching, but after 10 minutes or so the slight pain goes away. I do these stretches on my bed, so it's hard to find an excuse not to do them!! ",

Today I had treatment #10 of 33. My last treatment is on the day after my 50th birthday. The only thing I notice so far is feeling a bit tired by the Friday of each of these first two weeks, and a little pinkness on the side they are radiating, but nothing painful yet. The nurse told me people usually don't start feeling many side effects before treatment #20. She also said that the side effects continue for 2 to 3 weeks after treatment and can even get a bit worse during that after period. She said the side effects were skin burn, electrical twinges and fatigue. She gave me a tube of Natural Care Gel, made by Bard, which is an aloe gel. I'm to use it 2 times a day and never closer than 3 hours before a treatment, so I use it right after treament and before bed. She also gave me samples of Udderly Smooth which she says can be really soothing later on. I haven't tried it yet. She also said if I feel pain I can use Aleve or Motrin or Advil as they are good for pain and inflamation. And if I need more help I can call them whenever. My simulation appointment with CT scan was a bit long and my arms ached from keeping them still and over my head. The actual treatment is pretty fast. The radiation is very carefully aimed. In my case they move the machine to 3 differnet positions to shoot from different angles. I was told that the number of sessions they plan for you depends on where the cancer is or was and how big we are. I had a BMX with no recon. I find that a Champion sports bra (from Target) holds my micro-bead forms (from TLC) comfortably and has a soft band around my ribs that doesn't bother my skin so far. The bra has skinny straps and looks like a cute tank if it shows under whatever top I am wearing. Most mastectomy bras look to big and heavy to me.  Just like every other part of this process (surgery, chemo, more surgery), I did not look forward to this radiation step one bit. But, so far, it's O.K. I really didn't like hearing that it was so much easier than chemo....from people who had never had radiation or chemo. I like to hear from someone who has actually been there..... Good luck to everyone!        ",

I do hope that will go away eventually. Aloe gel soothes the minor pain. I have just 4 more treatments to the entire area and then 5 boosts to the insision. I am more tired than usual and am glad that I have few other committments other than getting through the final 2 weeks of treatment. Good  luck everyone with the week ahead!",

I am glad to join those of you who are done and hoping for the best for those of you still working through this. Now it's onto Tamoxifen in two weeks and onto the reat of my life. After almost a year it will be different to no longer be a patient. It sounds wonderful to me. I'm sure I'll continue to check in with BC.org because I can tell it's going to take a while to get over this, and to learn how to be vigilant without being obsessed with b.c.     Alotte, I agree with you that we are in the hands of others, and it is pretty hard to know who has the best hands!  I LOVE doctors (and nurses and techs) and am thankful to have them when I am sick, but I certainly wish there was some way for patients to know how good they are before they choose them. It's a problem. I hope you get better, more careful treatment in the future.   Thank you, everyone, for sharing your experiences. It's good to know we are not alone and it's great to get so many good ideas and to help one another.",

I HOPE everyone who started in September is done, but what with breaks for skin reactions, etc., the promised 6 - 7 weeks can stretch on longer. I know mine did. It's been 4 weeks since radiation ended and two weeks that I have been on Tamoxifen. My skin can still feel a bit sore in the neckline area and also behind my arm, on my back really. I still get numb arms on and off all night long every night. I had a BMX, so I think the combo of surgery and rads is to blame. I have sore thumbs every day. I think that is from chemo induced menopause. So far (fingers crossed) ,the morning dose of Tamoxifen has not increased any side effects I was previously having (hot flashes at night which started during chemo). I am thankful for that.  I am relieved not to have doctor appointments. I still tire after about four hours of activity. I wonder (at night mostly) if all the cancer cells are really gone. I try to enjoy each day as much as I can. I come to bc.org less often now, but I am thankful it is here as a great resource. When I do come on, I am saddened to see all the new women going through all the issues  . I think I read that there is a thread about \"Class of 2010\" or something where those of us who are done with active treatment can check in in the future. It is good to see familiar names and hopefully hear that we are doing all right.",

I like the champion brand sports bras I find at Target. Every season they come out with new colors, patterns and sometimes contrasting straps. They come with thin straps or thicker straps. I wear them under a low cut top and they look good. I have wide shoulders and wore size XL before surgery and I wear the same size now. I use microbead breast forms. They are lightweight and look rather like triangular bean bags. But once I put them in the sports bra it looks like I have breasts again. So far the one mastectomy bra I ordered online makes my breasts look unnaturally high. In the sports bra I can put the microbead shape lower and they look real. You can order microbead forms at www.tlc.org. You can wear them soon after surgery because they are soft. They cost $40 each. I have yet to get fitted for silicone prosthetics....and I had BMX July 12.    ",

This has been the most stressful time during my marriage, but I am so glad to have someone to go through this with. Your man friend sounds scared...which seems natural to me. I think my husband was more scared than I was.  You mentioned you are size AA so maybe reconstruction wouldn't be so mecessary? I think that sounds sensible. I'm a D, but I'm doing no recon. and plan to try some kind of beanies or protheses. I may go to a smaller size than what I had naturally....just something to give clothes some shape. But my no recon choice is also influenced by needing raiation....and you may not need radiation. If I hadn't have needed radiation I might well have tried some kind of reconstuction. Radiation doesn't rule out recon but it throws in some more complications as I understand it. Good luck to you! ",

Anyway, the drains came out after one week and I was out and about very fast.Start gentle stretching exercises right away and keep them up. The American Cancer Society has info and your doc should also. I had radiation about 8 weeks after surgery. 12 weeks of radiation sounds longer than any radiation schedule I have heard of....usually it's given in doses, but I'm not a doc. I had 35 doses which is pretty common. The radiation wasn't a problem until the last doses and then the two weeks after. I got a very painful burn over the area. But with pain meds and special burn cream, I could manage the pain, and it only lasted about two weeks. After chemo, surgery and radiation, give yourself time to get over the fatigue. Now that I'm four months past being finished I am finally feeling like my old self again. It takes time to recover, but it does happen. Good luck. You can do it.

It does have pockets attached with velcro that hold two drains and the bra part is double thickness (like a pocket) and the cami comes with soft breast forms so you can have some shape if you need it. I think you can get these kind of camis much cheaper at the TLC website (American Cancer Society?) if you have time to order.

Hard to imagine just what kind of 8 hour surgery could be wonderful and fun. Clearly he's been sampling the merchandise again. And Regina from Alabama, you are a scream! Am I right that vibrators would be called masagers in your state? I am totally in favor of masagers. My husband agrees. Being a Californian, I did have a former boss offer to find some marijuana for me while I was going through chemo. He's 65 years old. I did get nauseated during my 4 sessions of adriamycin and cytoxan, but the meds the doc prescribed worked. That and eating very lightly.  I'm spending a quiet weekend preparing for Monday's surgery. I actually told my husband, \"no cancer jokes\" last night, that I just needed lots of TLC. BUT I had to laugh when he said he thought he could turn peds (the little socks) into drain holders. We went to KMart this a.m. and found baggy tank tops (100% cotton), men's cotton pajama bottoms and PINK peds for those drain covers/holders. I am going to be stylin' during recovery. I really feel for those of you who are so new in this journey. I got my diagnosis last December and at least for me, time has really eased my original feelings of fear, disbelief and just plain dread. I have also learned so much about how some people really know how to help and others just don't have a clue. I was extremely lucky that I worked for 7 years at a museum and I had lots of friends who were docents, the museum's volunteers. So many of them have helped me, especially with the driving to chemo. And I know I could call them any time for anything. If you are needing help, one of my high school friends who went through BC last year while at the same time going through a contentious divorce said she found help through lotsahelpinghands.com. I'm appreciating all the good advice and good wishes from this site!",

Luckily they were clear. I hope you get the care you need and get good news as well. My Dad passed away just a few hours after I visited this afternoon. Very peacefully. My Mom hesitated to call me, but I am relieved to know that his suffering is over.  He was a regimental surgeon during the Korean War and helped a lot of men and saw a lot of pain and suffering. Then he was a family doctor and helped many people for many years. He will be a powerful presence in my life forever and I will continue to get strength and courage just thinking of him.",

I remember the doc said, \"You may have heard this will hurt. Now that we use lidocaine it doesn't.\" I thought, \"how many years did it take them to figure that out?\"   BS is breast surgeon.  PS is plastic surgeon. The BS does the lumpectomy or mastectomy and the PS can be there if you are going to have reconstruction and does the reconstruction. There is info somewhere on abbreviations.

I miss my full head of hair not to mention my breasts and look forward to looking more like I used to eventually.

My concern as of today is that I am still tired from chemo. But I don't want to put off surgery because BS is going on vacation first of August.....and I want to be sure he is available after surgery for post op care.

I am so sorry to hear that along with BC you are facing other medical issues. That is very difficult. I am glad to hear you have a supportive husband and mother. Chemo can be a long haul. The first thing you need to do is get a copy of your pathology report. I got mine from my BS because he did my original lumpectomy. Whoever did you mastecotomy should have one, or will have one soon. It tells you Stage, Grade, size of tumor, ER pos or neg, PR pos or neg, and HER2 pos or neg. Other stuff too I imagine. Then, your oncologist should meet with you and tell you what they recommend. I took my copy of the pathology to my oncologist to have her explain what it all meant. I have discovered that there are different types of BC so there are different chemo drugs given. Once you know the names of the drugs recommended and the regimine and your stage, you can search this site. There are lots of \"Starting chemo in (name of month here)\", and also some threads that might be about just one or another of the drugs. I looked at the posters' diagnoses. It was reassuring to find that those who had similar diagnoses were getting similar treatments. Then you will discover that people respond differently to similar treatment.......some people get terribly nauseated on drug A and others tolerate it much better. It's impossible to know ahead how you will do, but you can certainly get some tips from others in case you have a reaction to one drug or another. About exercising after mastectomy. I got an excellent booklet put out by the American Cancer Society at my local cancer resource center called Exercises After Breast Surgery . Most major hospitals have a cancer center. Call them. I showed the booklet to by BS and he said they were fine. I am not having recon. however, so if you have, I bet your PS would be the one to consult. I'm feeling pretty calm today and almost packed for tomorrow. I am motivated to get well. My Dad (87) is getting his wish to die at home. I have been glad to be able to be here for my Mom and to help as much as I could. Up until yesterday he would hold my hand and say he loved me every time I visited, and I would say the same to him. I always knew he loved me, but we never said those words. So that has been wonderful. Thankfully my Mom finally signed up for Hospice care which supplied the hospital bed and other supplies that were needed. She also found an experienced caretaker to help over the last week. Caring for a tall, still fairly heavy man is not easy. It's sad to see such a once strong man get so weak, but good to know he has been able to stay at home as he wished and get relief from pain. He was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the end of May and did not want any kind of treatment except pain management. Morphine has worked for his pain. Occasionally over the past months I have thought it was a bit much to have both Dad and me be sick at the same time. But looking back I see that actually I am thankful I live close to them at this time so I could go see him and help. I think caring for my Mom and Dad has helped me get through my own cancer treatment.   ",

Surgery took 2 hours.I was awake around 10 and nurse gave me something for the mild pain in recovery room. In hospital room around 11. Had a morphine drip which I just \"punched\" three times....at 1:00, 5:00 and 10:00. None needed on second day. I went home tuesday at 11:00 am. Got 1 vicodan pill \"for the road.\" Easy trip home (20 min. drive by DH) Great care at hospital, but hard to sleep with all the checking on blood pressure and temperature. I was glad that I took to the hospital: hand lotion, toothbrush and paste, lip balm, tea bags, ear plugs, magazines, phone and phone numbers. Not much pain at all on second day at home. Just took a Tylenol in afternoon and a generic darvocet at bedtime for good measure. Was able to sleep on my sides and my back. Surprized. Much easier than I expected. Today (2 days after surgery) got bandages off and saw the incisions. I was a \"D\" and I was surprized how they removed the breast tissue and made me pretty flat through two fairly short incisions. I'm told I'll get half the staples out one week post surgery, the drains perhaps 11 days out and the remaining staples 14 days post. I had more pain from my lymphectomy done with my lumpectomy back in December. Those lymph nodes don't like to be messed with! The drains are a hassle, just like everyone says. They show you how to empty them in the hospital, but I think the video I saw on youtube on stripping the drain tubes was more helpful. Last night my tubes were a bit clogged and I was happy my DH was right there to strip the clogs. I will go look for that video and post that for others. I am currently just pinning the drains to the inside of a large camp shirt....but hiding the bulk of them is going to be almost impossible.  Good news: pathology report is back and great news. The cancer in my right breast which was spread out like a constellation had shrunk (chemo worked) and the margins of the rt. mastectomy were clear (they got it all). My left breast (the prophylactic side) was clear. Sad to loose the breast, but not much. Glad to save my left lymph nodes. I don't have many remaining on my right side after they took many in Dec., and I believe we need lymph nodes (especially if we ever get lymphedema).     I am surprized with my lack of soreness or numbness. I think it's because they left the lymph nodes alone. I have good range of motion too and am comfortably doing the ACS recommended exercises. The only sore spot is where the drains come out. Will need to really secure them before more vigorous exercise. So glad to be over this surgery hurdle! Good luck to everyone with healing and future surgeries. Thanks for the kind words about my Dad. I thought of his strength as I prepared for surgery and it really helped me. I am glad he isn't suffering any longer. My Mom has friends and family to help her and we'll all get through this.",

I wore my expensive post-surgical cami (made by Amoena) out to dinner last night. My two drains from BMX no recon. come out of my chest right under where my breasts used to be. It was easy to put the drain bulbs in the detachable pockets and then to attach the pockets back to the cami with the secure velcro. I pulled a little stuffing out of supplied breast shapes and put the shapes into the pockets of the cami. Looked like breasts to me! The only bulk is the tubes from the drains....they look bulky under the cami. A loose fitting big shirt over the cami helps. This morning I put the drain bulbs into a fanny pack and went for a walk. Wore a regular sports bra over my flat chest. Stuffed in some fiber fill. Wore a loose blouse over top and tied it around waist loosely. the drain tubes howed a bit...so I wrapped a bandana around them. I take a percocet at night for a good night's sleep and otherwise no pain meds. Am feeling so much better now that I am two weeks post chemo. Now just have to take it easy and allow time to heal.My chest wouldn't win any prizes for looks, but I am hopeful with time it will look fine to me and to my DH.

The new path. report shows that the cancer in my breast shrunk. That gives me confidance that the chemo also killed any stray cancer cells that were floating around elsewhere in my body. I hope your CT scan and bone scan are clear. I know it is very hard to wait for those results. I hope you like your oncologist. You are smart to understand that you must take care of yourself first during chemo (AVOID sick people).  Loosing hair is no fun either. But compared to all we go through with our breasts.....at least hair grows back! youngmomof3: I hope you are feeling better today. I think your PS resident was really out of line.  I pinned my drains to a pair of nylons tied tightly around my waist for a shower. Worked great. I'm glad I found the American Cancer Society pamphlet on exercises after breast surgery. They might have helped after my lumpectomy/lyphm also. I can feel a little tightness when I start, but I go slowly and they work. 2 - 3 times a day. I can say they have been good for me with BMX no recon. ",

Both times there was swelling and pinkness. The first time I put up with the pain over a weekend and went in Tuesday to my already scheduled appointment. My doctor said, \"why didn't you call me?\" and then put me on strong antibiotics. The next time I got chills and fever and called the doc at 7:00 pm on a weekday.  You could always see what happens tonight and then call tomorrow a.m.  Swelling has got to indicate something. Pinkness, chills, fever also should be looked at I think. Both times antibiotics took care of the infection. I hope you feel better soon! By the way I am now doing radiation. I just completed my first week. I would think you would want to be as healed as possible before you start radiation. Best wishes!",

But then I had a detour and had more time to think about it and decided against. They did my first surgery (lumpectomy and lymphectomy) in Dec based on the not so great mammogram. So, sure enough they didn't get clear margins. Then, since it was also in some nodes, they decided that I had better do chemo before more surgery. I had a choice of 4 mos. of chemo or 6 mos. (same meds, just spread out or condenced) and I chose 6 months as I figured it would be easier on my body. It was, but it did drag on! I got Adiramycin and Cytoxan every 3 weeks 4 times and then 12 weekly doses of Taxol. Then two weeks later time for mastectomy. And I knew I would have radiation after that due to number of lymph nodes involved. I got very tired of being a patient. So I didn't want to take the extra time to do recon. I was also concerned about this happening again. My Mom had breast cancer two times, two years apart, on both sides. So I chose to do bilat and no recon. It did make for a very quick recovery after BMX. And I think I will be able to easily see or feel any recurrance. I think if they had caught mine earlier and I hadn't needed radiation I might have tried implants. It just seemed like one too many steps in treatment considering everything else. It's possible I might do recon sometime in the future, but also possible I won't. So far I find the microbead breast forms comfortable and my husband finds me attractive. I'm getting used to it. Good luck with your expanders. My radiation oncologist assured me he could do radiation over expanders just fine. Swiftbird: I was also told not to take extra antioxidants, to eat well and drink lots of water. ",

However, none of us know how our skin will do and if we will have other side effects. My 6 mos of chemo were very unpleasant (and I did loose all my hair), but it had a rythm to it: a few bad days and then gradually better until the next treatment, then repeat. BMX after chemo was scary but not as bad as I expected and I got gradually better. With radiation things just keep getting worse, and we don't know ahead how much worse. I find that the unknown is the hardest. I keep telling myself that even if I have a few bad weeks, during the last sessions and even after the treatments are over (for a total of 2 weeks? 3? 4?), that will be a shorter amount of overall time then the chemo treatment took. Anyone else not like this march into worse and worse? I know I can do it, and I know all of us can do it, but I'm just saying.....Radiation is no fun. \"Cakewalk\" will be removed from my vocabulary. Anyone else feel this way?   And good luck with those radiation techs. I like mine (there are four that rotate), although it seems like some are more precise than others.

I Will ask the rad docs about red wine if I really start drinking up a storm!! As for clinical trials I have no knowledge. I do know that if I were in your shoes (where radiation isn't working for you) and if there is some other way to reduce your risk of recurrance, I would do it. I would do practically anything to kill this cancer and to make sure as best I could that it not come back. My chemo shrunk the cancer in by breast (compared pathology report afterward to original pathology and MRI report), so I am a believer. My rad onc was certainly there during the simulation....doesn't sound right that he not be there.I got the impression that he was looking at my previous MRI and then deciding whre to x-ray and what area they should look into for the CT scan. Basically getting the right pictures so that the radiation plan would be most effective. He also came into my rad session today after it was over. He was drawing on me where the boosts will be aimed. Then the tech traced what the rad onc had drawn and made a template to use to focus the boosts. As far as shaving pits....I was told not to shave in the treated area. My treated area starts about in the middle of one arm pit, so I don't shave there at all. And I occassionally remember to shave the other side. I remind myself that I will likely never see these techs again and they see so many patients they couldn't care less. ",

After 28 treatments and 1 boost I asked for and got a break and sure enough, my skin got worse before it got better. Three days after radiation was over, small areas of skin started breaking down. The silvadene they prescribed, covered with petrolatum-infused gauze and then a bandage to protect clothes, really helped sooth the pain and also provided antibiotic to the skin to prevent infection. Some hours of just air on the skin each day halped also. But it took about one week to have the whole area that was radiated go through this process. I am flat after BMX no recon and it was too painful to wear froms and a bra. I feel for anyone who has to wear a bra through this. Darvocet and Advil and Ativan (at night) also helped. My skin is finally looking pink rather than red and I am greatly relieved. But it has been two weeks of real discomfort. Tomorrow I see if I can finish my last four boosts. I went to a family weddiong this weekend and a funeral. When everyone told me how great I looked I thought to myself, \"It's a good thing you can't see my chest, because it looks horrifying.\" The fact is, I have found the pain of radiation as bad or worse than the pain from my BMX, no recon. After MX everyone expected I'd be out for weeks and I had hardly any pain after about two weeks. Through rads I look fine but the pain and fatigue are holding on for a good two weeks so far. I am glad I am almost done. Then it's on to Tamoxifen. Whoopie!! ;-)  ",

And thanks for your kind words about the other issues I am working through this summer. I have three weeks until surgery and now that my 15 year old daughter is away at camp it is time to get serious about preparing for surgery. Just two more Taxol sessions! Yay!!! ",

I saw a lot of breasts at the beach! I also am pretty tired of my weird post-chemo hair, lack of eyebrows and feeble eyelashes. Well, I came back home and realized (once again), life is certainly about more than breasts. I am so fortunate to have a husband and a daughter and parents and siblings and friends and a home (luckily not on a beach), and other than this BC I have pretty good health. So, my chin is up again and I'm going to stop feeling sorry for myself. I'm done with chemo and that is GREAT. For anyone who hasn't done the chemo part yet, although really unpleasant, it can be done. Tomorrow I have pre-op visit with BS and will ask for a nice smooth chest. Next Monday is the day. Good luck everyone!       ",

That way if there are side effects during radiation they know they are not from the Tamoxifen, but from the rads. I wouldn't think that the flu shot would be a problem, but I'm not a doctor! My weeks are getting pretty routine by now. Most days the treament is quick: a 30 second zap from above, and then15 seconds from each side with the bollus (piece of rubber) on my skin. Usually once a week they also take x-rays from each angle, but that is quick. So I am in and out of the office in about 10-15 minutes. On Mondays I see the doctor. That can add quite a bit of time.  Today was \"doctor day\" and I was there for two hours, mostly sitting and waiting. But now that I know, I can plan accordingly. My skin is definitely pink, but not sore yet. I am using aloe gel twice a day and no deodorant on treatment side. I wear a cotton sports bra and so far it is comfortable, but then again, I don't have any breasts. My soft forms stay in my purse (patiently) during treatment. I had some red wine this weekend and I felt especially healthy as I drank it. Have to admit I now drink much less than I used to.....but I actually have grown to like green tea! ",

She applied silvadine (burn ointment with antibiotic) all over my treated area (including the small area where skin has come off), then a layer of a thin gauze that had some kind of vaseline-like coating, then some bandages, and then a mesh tube (like a tube top) that holds everything onto my chest so that we don't have to use tape. Such a relief to know I can protect my sensitive skin from my clothes. I am attending a rehearsal dinner, a funeral, a wedding and a concert this weekend and I may even be able to wear a sports bra over this bandaging with some soft forms inside and look kind of normal. Yay!!! The nurse said that radiated skin can be this sore for a weak and a half or so after radiation finishes. I am glad I am having a break from rads this week and finishing boosts next week. She also said I shouldn't put off taking pain meds until nighttime...that the pain kind of mounts up this way. So, I'm taking some Advil in the day and Darvocet at night rather than toughing it out during the day as I had been doing. She gave me supplies so I can do this bandaging myself. I  figure I'll do it in the mornings each day and just put on silvadine and an old tee-shirt at night.     My medical oncologist said I could wait until two weeks after rads to start tamoxifen. She said that way they know better which treatment is causing which side effects!!  I already have hot flashes from chemo-induced menopause, but I'm convinced tamoxifen really helps prevent recurrence and I want to do anything I can to do that.",

I am still have monthly follow-up visits with the surgeon who did my July BMX and port surgeries, but I would hope these visits will be over soon. I'm thinking the rest of my follow up visits over the next five years will be with my medical oncologist (the woman who figured out my chemo treatment). That schedule is every three months for the first year, then every six months for 2 years, then once a year. At those visits she will give me a physical exam and review results from a blood test. I don't have breasts, so no more mamograms for me. She has told me to keep my eye out for rice-like lumps on my chest as that is what recurrances can look like. The blood tests measure a tumor marker that indicates if there is anything to be concerned about. She will also be monitoring me to see how I do on Tamoxifen which I am to take for 5 years. Is everyone done yet? I hope so. I've  really enjoyed my first week with no doctor appointments. I have continued to be very tired. I got out for some walking today and felt really slow and creaky.

I had my BMX no recon in July 2010. I am used to it now, one year and eight months later. I think it took me at least a year to quit thinking about it every day. Time is the best healer, in my opinion. We get busy living life, things happen all around us, our families go through new experiences, good and bad, and cancer doesn't have to be front and center in our minds all the time. I'm sorry your chest is still sore. I wore light weight microbead forms for at least a year...mostly because I was too mad about the whole thing to go get fitted. I was fortunate to have a GREAT, quick experience getting fitted. I liked the first pair of Aomena silicon prostheses the fitter brought me...light and smaller than my actual breasts had been. They look great in a comfortable Aomena bra and I could wear them every day if I wanted to. I work from home, so I have the flexibility to go flat a lot.

My husband says he forgets I don't have breasts as I look like I used to when I wear prostheses. I also go flat a lot and he doesn't seem to care. He sees me totally naked of course but when we are intimate I like to wear a pretty camisole....probably because my chest doesn't look particularly good to me. Our sex life is different because the attention to breasts is not there but I think we are both satisfied anyway. I think a great smile and a great attitude are impoprtant.",

I am on Tamoxifen now, and that would also keep me from having periods.  ",

I like the microbead forms and find that they make me look just like I used to look before. I wear them for occasions when I want to look like I used to look. But very recently I've found that I am getting comfortable going flat in public also. I find that as long as the rest of my outfit looks good (I'm talking cute shoes, pants, cute top and a jacket, and great earrings), I think I look just FINE. It's a little bit funny that on some days it looks like I have breasts and on some days I don't, but that's how things work out. It really is COMFORTABLE to go flat.    ",

I think your body needs good nutrition to be in the best shape possible for your infusion days, so fasting doesn't make sense to me. I ate a well-balanced diet in the days before chemo. I snacked while at the infusion center (bananas, apple slices, almonds, crakers, fruit juice)  I found that I didn't feel like eating much at all after chemo for the first few days. So it was good to be well-fed in the days before chemo. I agree with earlier posters that drinking lots of water the day before, during and after is very important. You want your veins to be nice and plump for easier infusion, and you want to wash the meds right through. You'll get through it. Talk with the nurses. They will help you.",

Congratulations on your wight loss. I do think that depending on your body type and clothing choices, going flat can look just fine. ",

I think I was mad that nothing would be like my real breasts, so whatever was simplest was O.K. by me. I was happy enough with microbead forms in inexpensive regular sports bras. But my job requires some physical work, and I always felt like they needed regular adjustment...what a pain. So yesterday I went to a prostheses shop to check it out. Within 20 minutes I had a pair of Amoena forms and 3 bras. I told the woman who helped me I just wanted some shape in clothes, and I chose a B cup, although I had been a C. I said no underwires, and she found me bra styles that are soft and comfortable. What a difference a mastectomy bra makes!! The woman helped me find three by Amoena that fit my body. I look like I have real breasts. They are also more comfortable than the microbead forms. They even feel like real breasts. I should have done this months ago.I guess I am just stubborn!!!
