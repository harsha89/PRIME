During rads (which I had Jan - March of 07), I had no problems - didn't use my inhaler at all; however, this month with all of this pollen I've been having a tough time, using the albuterol inhaler almost daily.

I was diagnosed at 39 with triple negative bc and had a 5cm tumor (as well as a 1cm tumor) and three positive lymph nodes. I had my mastectomy first, then chemo followed by radiation. My rads onc. explained to me the reason I had to have radiation was due to various factors: 1. The tumor being 5cm. 2. 3 or more lymph nodes involved. 3. vascular involvement. Now, she told me if the tumor was 5cm or less in size and I had no lymph node involvement, she would not press for the rads, but because I had three lymph nodes affected (one being 1cm), she insisted I have radiation. She also said that if I had had no lymph node involvement, but had my tumor been larger than 5cm, she would again recommend rads. Perhaps your mom has vascular involvement? It sounds as though her tumor is large, maybe a bit larger than 5cm? Please note that triple negative cancer responds well to chemo. That is good news. If you want to PM me, please do. Also, there is a thread called Triple Negative. You will find more information and lots of support there. Best wishes to you and your mom, Raye",

The plastic surgeons I consulted with agreed and will not do the procedure, as the failure rate is so very high - almost 60% I believe. They are willing to do lat flaps with implants, however.

The major step would be going to work flat; if I could only work up the courage. Cathi - your daughter nailed it with the hot and athletic. You truly are. You look spectacular. What an inspiration you are. Now about that bandeau top, it does not ride up, but it DOES slide down, you can sort of tell it is riding low in the pic. I have to make sure that the back tie is tied very tightly and that I put an extra knot on each side of the halter string that goes around my neck, although it still tends to slide a bit.",

Good for you.  I understand completely how you feel about being w/o forms with people you know - now I don't mind my girlfriends/husband/family seeing me like flat; however, my difficult social arena for going without my forms is work.    Barbe - I see the pics you posted - you are gorgeous and - might I add - appear to be about 35 years old if not younger - you rock it Girl! Egal - you are thinking of getting your implants out? Are they giving you troubles? I will tell you that not having breasts is freeing and while not perfect; as we've discussed here, there are ways to work around it, both physically and psychologically. Best wishes in your decision. This thread is so motivational, Cathi. Also, it makes me feel somewhat \"normal.\" Somewhat hard to explain, so I'll just say that it is nice to have other lovely women w/o breasts to talk with and share our stories, fears, courage and triumphs.

I agree with what you say about your ribs sticking out more when you are walking tall - in that pic I am trying to have good posture and, as you can see, the ribs are really sticking out. I almost bought the cutest suit the other day, it was a tankini with a bandeau-like top - sort of like one that you have, but the bottoms were cut down to you know where.  A little too low riding for me. Thanks Barbara - yes, the top does stay put, but I have to tie it very tightly in the back,  knot the string that goes around my neck twice and not really do anything. ha. I can get in the water, but if there are waves, that thing may be riding them itself. It does tend to ride down a bit. If I plan on really playing in the water, I wear a sports bra. You know, I've wondered the same about my dog, if he notices when I am flat and when I am not. I don't think he does; like your dog, he doesn't seem to care - 91 lbs laying on me no matter what I have on, although he might just prefer when I have the pillow-like forms on.  He's a little spoiled - just a little.",

I have very narrow shoulders, long torso and short legs (BAH), but try to make the most of and take care of what I do have. Judy - I can't really offer any advice on how to deal with these feelings, but can tell you that they are quite normal. Your hair will grow. Just be patient - I know much easier said than done, right? Hang in there. As for the body image and you seeing those women in bathing suits - you had one of those moments. You saw women in bathing suits and perhaps saw some cleavage (I am assuming here) and felt you are not \"normal\" because you haven't had your reconstruction yet. Again, just surmising. Honey, I will tell you we all feel this way from time to time. It can be the Victoria's Secret catalogue that comes to the house every day, or the VS commercial, going to the beach as you mention or a movie with bit of nudity and there they are! Boobs everywhere. Some days these things bother me - other days, they don't bother me at all. I try to concentrate on the positive - I am healthy, feeling good, active. It will get easier - the hardest time for me emotionally was AFTER treatment was over - it was like \"now what?\" Just know that you are not alone in these feelings, and YES, they come and go and probably always will, but they will lessen.

The prophy mast is so much easier than the regular. Like you, my BS told me I was her only patient in my age bracket (late 30's) who didn't have reconstruction. Also, like you, I do not like any of the options out there for me, so I will wait. I am happy now being flat, although there are times when I wish small breasts, but not worth what I would have to give up (muscle). Also, want to take a moment to thank Barbara for her wonderful website and her support. THANK YOU! Here is a pic of Keira Knightly. She is my hero. Very very small busted, she actually got upset when they wanted to Photoshop her breasts for the Duchess movie promo posters.

Is that why your mastectomy bra is uncomfortable? You still have soreness from the reconstruction? Not having hair and breasts is hard. Easier said than done, but try and think of it this way - focus on your goal of getting done with chemo; you are almost there. You will start to feel better physically and your hair will start growing in.   In the meantime, know you are not alone. Maybe try a wig or if you are not a wig girl, maybe a funky hat or scarf or go topless. Put some makeup on and since you cannot wear your mast. bra yet, maybe find something comfortable that you feel attractive in to wear. Surround yourself with supportive people, people who you feel good about yourself with.

Perhaps having something up against the chest wall prevents the tightness, as Dawn mentions?

He is a wonderful man who did not marry me for my breasts (obviously, as I was an A cup before bc). I wear prostheses, they look real and I feel comfortable in them.

About the bras/forms:  I'm with Cathi, give yourself time to heal. I did get my mastectomy bra and forms right away, but at the time, I had had only the unilateral mast., so I ended up wearing the form in a regular bra. Now that I've had a prophylactic mast., I wear a mastectomy bra with forms to work and actually find the bras and forms quite comfortable. Lately, I haven't been wearing my forms shopping, to friends and families home, etc. Just easier, I guess. Maybe you'll get the bras and forms and decide you don't want to wear them.

I would like to go form free in order to wear some of the cute summer styles that will not work with a mast bra - dresses like the ones Cathi posted and am considering buying some cute halter tshirts to wear form free (I was going to do that this weekend, but went out of town). This weekend, I did go out a bit around the campground form free in a tight t, walking the dog - it was liberating. Also went to the beach with no forms in my suit, which I never do - so I am pretty used to that. About your cami question, Barbara - I do think that a cami would help you. I say this because I agree - you and I have similar builds and I cannot wear the tight tee (although I did this weekend, but does walking my dog around a campground count? ha) out, as bones WILL show through. I think the cami would add an extra layer and prevent that, so it may be a very good idea indeed! Wouldn't hurt to try. Let us know how you do. Raye",

Like I mentioned many times, I wear my prostheses to work, but around the house I go flat and have been experimenting going flat on the weekend to places such as the grocery store, library, etc. and I must say, there are certain clothes that just look rockin w/o boobs! Seems strange, but for us, I guess that is a good thing. One thing I notice when I don't have my mast bra with prostheses on, is that my chest wall skin is tight. Maybe the slight pressure of the bra against my chest takes away the feeling of tightness? Does anyone else have that tightness in her chest wall? I cannot imagine doing reconstruction on this tight chest.",

Well, I found this gorgeous dress with ruffles all the way down the length of the dress. It has the most beautiful print in deep blues, purples with a cream backdrop. The best thing about it is that I do not have to wear forms with it and you cannot really tell because of the ruffles and the print! Also, the very thin straps are attached to the dress in such a way that none of that area beneath the underarm shows. I will have my husband take a pic and post it if I remember. So exciting to find something flattering for our type of body. Also, found a dress with a neckline that is like a circle? I cannot think of the name of this particular neckline. Perfect for us.

I wear Amoena's Jada 2149 bra; very simple, seamless and tremendously comfortable. I have the bra in champagne, black and burgandy. I will have to get back on the forms - all I know is that they are Amoena as well and are size 3. Wait, I was thinking the info was just on the box, maybe it's on the boob itself - I now have a prosthesis setting on my desk (lord I hope no one comes in my office)...OK - the info has worn off a bit, but looks like Natura Light 2S 447.

I wear size 3 (small B?) protheses to work and social functions, but go flat around the house and to the gym.  My options for reconstruction are very limited due to the rads (no implants or free flaps) and I do not want a TRAM.

They will have you taped up in a big Ace bandage, so just a pajama top that buttons in the front will do you fine when leaving the hospital and for a few days after that. I had eight days off of work after my mast and I don't think I wore a cami until I went back to work - I pretty much lived in pajamas and lounging clothes. When I did return to work, I wore  nice comfy camis (two nude colored and a black to wear under button down shirts until I received my prothesis). As far as what to wear with your tank tops, I wore my prosthetic in my regular bra (an A cup) and then tank on top. Now doing yoga and climbing - it might just pop out, so you might be better off just wearing a sports bra under your tank, which is tight enough to hold it in place. That's what I do when I run (if I even wear the \"boobs\") - put them in the sports bra - they do not move. Also, a fanny pack is a nice place to hide your grenades from your drain(s) when you have company over, so they can't see it. Best of luck to you! Raye",
