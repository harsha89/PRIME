Did not find the injection for the sentinel node as bad as I had inticipated the radiologist was very fast. Received sedation and a regional block, once in the OR the surgeon said she felt one or the other of them wasn't working well so they decided general was the way to go. Once in recovery I can say it was the regional block had not taken because I was already feeling pain. Not extreme, but I wasn't expecting any due to a block form12-18 hrs of pain relief. Surgeon didnt offer a lot post op to my family or me. Says she is hopeful she captured all of the tumor but of course no one has microscopic eyes. The area had some smaller moon shaped areas nearby and she feels at this point she has taken all she can in a lumectomy. First 3 nodes were positive so more were taken, but she didn't answer how many. My concerns of course are the level of node involvement and the need for more surgery if it wasn't all removed. She felt strongly going into yesterday I was a good candidate for a lumectomy based on the size 3cm, and location approximately 2 o'clock. Should have a path report in 48-72 hrs. Drain til follow up appointment Tuesday next week. I have enjoyed this board and reading stories of others....so many inspirational stories here. Prayers for the others in this September group as well as the many others waging on in the fight of their lives.",

Before administering the block, they give your some sedation to relax you. I've had children and epidural injections and i would say its similar. No pain with the injections, and the sedation makes you a bit drowsy. In my actual case once to the OR, where the plan was conscious sedation it was felt by the anesthesia doc that the block had not taken. I was already semi asleep and have no memory of anything, but general ended up being used. So, the only negative was no 12-18 hrs of pain relief. Hope your surgery goes well...wishing you the best.",
