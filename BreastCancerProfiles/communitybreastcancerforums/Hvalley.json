I am 56 and was diagnosed her2+ grade 3+ 2cm breast cancer, R breast in Sept. 2016. Began chemo on Oct. 20, 2016 (TCH + Pertuzumab) and Nulasta auto inject after each treatment. I had this every 3 weeks for 6 treatments, with my last chemo Feb, 12, 2017. I will continue Herceptin infusions through Nov. 2017. I had a lumpectomy / lymphectomy in April, 2017. Biopsies were negative, so the chemo worked and I am in remission!!! PTL!!! I began radiation last week, I'll have 21 treatments. My father died on March 12th, exactly one month after my last chemo. He had cancer and was in Hospice Care. I had not had surgery yet so he died before we found out I was in remission. That was awfully hard for everyone. Chemo was rough but seems like a distant memory now. It was worth it... It did the job and killed the cancer. Hopefully the Herceptin + radiation will keep it from returning. It has been a long journey. So far the radiation has been ok except shoulder a little sore. I began having UTI's after chemo (4 infections so far). I've been on various antibiotics and am taking another one now. My oncologist wants me to see a urologist if I get one more. She thinks the chemo possibly weakened my urinary system. I hope these antibiotics will work this time. How are you? How have your treatments been, and are you still receiving any kind of treatments? I still have chemo brain. Hair very slow coming back. My fingernails still tear like tissue paper and my fingertips got so smooth that I drop things all the time. It's like my finger print ridges are gone and I can't grip anything! I'm adjusting to it. Have you had vision troubles? I'd like to know how other folks are doing through out their treatment.",
