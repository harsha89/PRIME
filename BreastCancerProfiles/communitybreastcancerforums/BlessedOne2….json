I was released from my surgeon two weeks after my lumpectomy and started chemo about 3 weeks later.  I started radiation about 2 weeks after my last Taxol treatment. I was blessed to \"breeze through A/C\" if there is such a thing  with no illness but a few minor aches, some fatigue and neuropathy.  As someone else posted exercise, diet  and attitude can make a hugh difference. If you are a praying person, then you may know that prayer supercedes all of the above. With radiation, I took 6 weeks of radiation on my right breasts - that was daily x5 so about 30 treatments.  Each treatment only last a few minutes.   Lovelylady, be encouraged to continue to ask your questions here.  As you can see, we are very willing to share our experiences with anyone who has to join us in this community.  Take care and remember to breath.   Hugs, Wanda  ",

Love's book is an excellent resource.  It is a very thick book so only read the sections you need at the time.   As someone has already said,  don't get too far ahead with your thoughts or your reading. I too suggest that you follow your PCP's recommendation and see an oncologist.  It may depend on whether you go to a major treatment center or smaller office, but they will ask for all of your reports -  Mammo, ultrasound, biopsy, pathology, film and possibly CDs etc. This can take a little time.  Remember that waiting is so very much a part of the initial process before surgery.  Afterwards things seem to move faster.     Call the doctor you saw and request a copy of all of your reports for yourself as well.   I chose to go to a major treatment center and see an oncologist rather than (excuse the term) a local breast surgeon.  I preferred the multi-disciplinary team approach.     The oncologist may also recommend a BRCA test, which is simply a blood stick to see if you carry a hereditary gene.  If so, this may impact the surgical decision.    Here's another suggestion:  talk to your insurance co to learn what your benefits are for this. Once you have a doctor's name, check to see if they participate in your network before making an appointment (otherwise your costs will be higher) Much of this can be done online so you don't have to wait until office is open.  Know that many prayers are being said for you.  Hughs, Wanda",

We can make our best plans and do our best to take care of our bodies and still this beast  invades us.  For some practical tips - pray and if you belong to a church, get others to intercede for you; stay knowledgable and participate in your treatment planning;, if you have dietary concerns and your cancer center offers the services of a nutritionist - make an appointment.  Peace be with you.

Eliz46 - the wig thing is not for me either.  I had long, thick hair that I cut in June.  My hair has been coming out since day 15 post first treatment.  I will probably get it all cut off tomorrow before I go for tx2.  It is tough trying to decide what to go with (hats, scarves, caps or all)  especially when I didn't do either before BC. It's time to experiment with some new looks and styles. Shae - You are in my prayers.  Try to let go of your grandson's situation and Let God handle it. He is still in control. The worry isn't going to do YOU any good.  I know b/c I've traveled a similar journey. Tara - You're definitely in the right place for support, encouragement and guidance.  Hair usually doesn't fall out immediately so you have some time to get it cut between your 1st and 2nd tx.  It may help to get it cut twice so that it isn't so overwhelming for you.   What chemo will you be starting with?  I have having my second tx of A/C tomorrow.   Be strong for me and I'll be strong for you.
