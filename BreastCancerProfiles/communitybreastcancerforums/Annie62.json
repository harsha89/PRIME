I was pre-meno at dx, went into chemopause at 42 and have never had a nother period (3+ years). My onc says that there was a study that showed 2 years of tamox followed by 3 of Aromasin is slightly better than just one or the other. If I had bad SE's on the AI, I will go back to Tamox. The theory is that the tamox 'primes' your body for the AI and it's more effective that way. Annie",

It's not clear that the surgeon sent the 3 nodes to pathology. Did he and are you waiting on the report? It should take 3 weeks. If they didn't, I agree that is very strange. My surgeon, after getting a positive sentinel node, did an axillary dissection in the same surgery. I also don't do well with anesthesia and pain killers. I threw up for days from percocet. My subsequent surgeries were much easier - shorter time under anesthesia, different pain killers. 3. Get a 2nd opinion for sure. I did even though I was happy with onc.And the surgeon sounds like more of a problem than the onc. The oncs see a lot of patients. Its good that you are watcing out for your mom. 4. If your mom does further surgery (lymph nodes) use a surgeon who specializes in breast surgery if possible. 5. A PET scan will also show axillary lymph nodes that might have cancer so the dissection might not be done. On the other hand, if its only moved to nodes and you can remove it, that's less cancer in your body. 6. The onc may be able to order an oncotype test that will give an idea if chemo will be helpful or not. Good luck to you, Annie 4.",

You could make this veggie by leaving out the turkey. I noted my tweaks on the basic recipe. Also I always use a 1 lb package of turkey and double the recipe and freeze half. We eat half for dinner and bring the leftovers for lunch during the week. Annie ",

This time I'm likely to be bald indefinitely.  And my daughter is in middle school and more sensitive to me walking around with just a scarf or hat.  I hate wigs because they make my head itch. And the second time around, there was a largish patch in the back that I think would not have fallen  out. I think having some hair peeking out under hats scarves looks better so maybe that would have helped. (Oh - the hair halos are even itchier than a regular wig).  So I figured maybe having some bits of hair on my head might help reduce the itchy factor with the wig. . My hair is currently a chin length bob. I thought bald patches would be less visible than if I cut it short in layers.  But the shedding is annoying.   If anyone has any experience just letting it fall out over time and how that worked for them, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks, Annie Stage IV 8/2012 Liver, brain, bone, mets.

Lots of NYC restaurants are on Trip Advisor.  Check to see if Restaurant Week is during your stay. You can eat in really nice places for much less during the promotion.  Blue Fin in Times Square is a good recommendation. I've been there for brunch on the weekend and it was reasonable (for NYC)  and very good. Chinatown is a good recommendation for reasonable food. The subway makes it easy to try different neighborhoods in Manhattan so you might be able to find a place cheaper than in midtown. The lower east side has lots of reasonable places in all types of cuisines. If you want to stay in midtown going west (9th /10th Ave) above 40th has lots of places.  Becco is in midtown and has a prix fixe pasta dinner that is a good value. The food is good.  LIttle Korea is about one block in the 30's that has good Korean BBQ places. Lots of fun. You can cook your own food on a table top grill. Oh and during your visit if you get tired of 'foreign' food, Tir Na Nog has two locations - one at 33rd near 8th ave and the other one in Times Square. I met a man in Ireland this summer who said he ate there every night he was in NYC. :) Have a wonderful visit. ",

After that hopefully daily prunes/juice/fiber can keep things under control. I also drink lots of hot tea (usually peppermint) all day. It seems to help keep things moving for me. I also say to use the heavy duty drugs but you may want to find out first if constipation is a side effect. I know it is with opoids. Hugs, Annie",

Once they were drained I was a million times better. As for scans, if there are mets only in your pleura they may only show up on a PET scan as opposed to a CT scan. Mine did not show up (they were too small to be seen with CT) but did light up the PET scan.

You would think that the chemo room nurse would be a little more on the ball about how her words would affect you. I think a good rule of thumb would be - don't talk Stage IV to patients who aren't Stage IV unless they ask. This reminded me of one of the worst things someone said to me. I am one of those people that didn't really get bothered by insensitive things people said. There were a couple of comments, all well intentioned, that got to me a bit but I knew that the person who spoke meant well and was someone who didn't have tons of experience talking to a cancer patient. But one comment still makes  me angry. I was in the recovery room after my lumpectomy. I felt horrible. I was puking and was in a lot of pain (I was under for a long time because the sentinel node came back positive and it turns out that I don't do well on percocet). So the the surgeon gives DH and me the bad news about the lymph  nodes and how I'll need to meet with an oncologist now and how I'm not really early stage anymore. I feel so horrible physically and they are trying to get me out of there since I'm not supposed to stay the night and the recovery nurse says to me \" Don't worry, if you don't have clear margins or if it comes back you can get a mastectomy and the plastic surgery looks great these days.\" It hit me like a sucker punch. This was not the moment to be thinking that I needed another surgery! I already felt worse than I'd ever felt in my life from surgery and had just heard for the first time that this wasn't almost Stage 0. Since then I\"ve spoken to a number of patients and doctors who agree that while they love the facility and the doctors, the nurses at this hospital leave something to be desired. Try not to let what the nurse said keep you down any longer. Focus on what your onc says and how well you are doing. Oh and don't think that because you don't have a ton of SEs that the chemo isn't working. My SEs weren't that bad either. I don't think there is any correlation between SEs and how well the chemo is working.  I hope to day gets better for you.....  Annie",

Hugs to you, Annie",

Just an fyi.  Other lines that have commonly available and not too pricey paraben-free items (make sure you check the ingredients as some individual items may contain parabens), are Alba, Jason (although I'm not crazy about the Jason line), Avalon Organics. Avalon makes nice bath gets etc. I've used Alba lip balms and moisturizers which were pretty nice. I don't like Jason shampoos but the conditioner was ok; I found the vitamin E night cream heavy but use it on my hands or when my 5 yr old gets chapped winter cheeks/hands. Kiss My Face, Tom's of Main and Burts Bees are other options.  I'm think I remember a whole discussion on this - maybe from the alternative forum? Lots of good info online if you google it.  As for myself, I try new items as I find them. Some of my products still have parabens because I haven't found an acceptable substitue yet. Deoderants, lip balm and skin creams which I use frequently and stay on the skin and could potentially be absored. are more important to me to be paraben free. I don't worry so much about shampoo as it is washed out. I wear make-up infrequently so I dont' worry about that either, but if I find a paraben-free item I like I use it. Annie",

I guess it is less toxic on the liver. I got my second opinion at Dana Farber in Boston and I was very happy with them. My onc also recommends Fox Chase (PA area) and I think another. I'll see if I can find the other name.  Good luck!",

I can't imagine nursing staff reprimanding me  because I broke the 'rules'. I think the advice to wait a few weeks is sound. You may decide that as bad as the nursing staff's attitude was, it  is not worth your energy and unless its an emergency to go to Seattle in the future. My gyn doesn't like the hospital where I get most of my cancer care because she's not crazy about the nursing staff. I've been to two other hospitals with her and I see her point.  If you are ever in the hospital again, I would make sure that there is an order to give you Ativan if needed. I think all hospitals don't allow you to self administer 'outside' meds.  I hope you are feeling better.  Annie",

I was in terrible pain for about six weeks in December/January and was talking lots of pain meds, used heating pads and basically laid on the couch. I'm feeling much better now. I wonder if it was Faslodex which I came off of just before I started feeling better. I took Tylenol PM to help me sleep which helped a bit. If it continued I would have asked for an Rx for something stronger. I hope you get relief soon. ",

She's okay with it but really appreciated it that during school I wore hair. It's a tough age.  Rosestoeses - that Cure Diva woman.

How are healthcare workers so clueless? My favorite. I'm in the emergency room (for hours) with breathing problems related to pleural effusion waiting to be admitted. I'm alone since DH is home with my 9 year old. I'm pretty tough and told him to stay home and just come up in the morning when she goes to school and we had family picking her up after.  My nurse, Richard, I guess in an effort to 'connect' with me felt he had to tell me about how his 54 year old mother left his family too soon after dying of colorectal cancer. Oh yeah, that makes this 49 year old mother of a 9 year old feel really great. Don't they give them training in nursing school that says 'do not tell sick people about people who have died'. It doesn't cheer them up.  Most of the nurses/techs were good with few not so good. I had one nurse who kept talking to me about God even though I told her I was not a believer and she offered to do a massage on my shoulders and she basically just was trying to do this guided imagery thing. Horrible. Thankfully  I only had her for one shift. She also let me know she was skilled in pain management and works for hospice. thanks. I want to think about hospice right this very second. But her best remark was when checking my breathing she asks me if I'm going to do reconstruction. Why are you asking me that? What does it have to do with my care for pleural effusions. Why would I want to discuss it with you instead of a plastic surgeon? It was weird. Just to show I'm not overly sensitive, when i was getting dressed to leave, the nurse assisting me (who just came on shift and was very nice) asked me if I had a bra. I said 'don't need those anymore'. She realized what she did and apologized but I was laughing. that I thought was funny. I think she was relieved.",

This is for my treatment which isn't changing month to month. I suspect that there is some sort of diagnostic coding error or something going on. I wish the hospital would fix it. Anyway, you may want to call your infusion center or MO's office and speak to them about a possibility of Aetna requiring additional pre-approvals or different coding or something. If it does turns out that the Aetna plan is clearly requiring more paid by the patient, I wish you the best in finding out a way to get better coverage. Are you covered by an employer policy?

On the Chemotherapy forum, there is a pinned topic for 'headcovering during chemo'. One of the companies is FranceLuxe. They have a 'good wishes' program where they will send you a headwrap at no charge. I think these were one of Oprah's 'favorite things'.  I got mine about a week ago. It's a beautiful pattern (you pick) in silk. Unlined so it will be great when it gets warmer here in NJ. I is slightly tight, but I will snip the spandex in the rear a bit. I have a pretty big head. You do order by size. Oh and it is pre-wrapped so you don't need to learn how to do that. My favorite headscarf is the BeauBeau. Lots of choices. Easy to style (leave tails hanging, make a side knot.) It has a cotten lining which prevents slipping and is pre-wrapped. I like the cotton lining. I hope its not too hot on me in summer because its my fave. If yes, I'll see if she makes unlined ones. Sizing was good for me. It cost about $70. I do wear a wig for work, but my othe favorite hat is a thin cotton one from ACS TLC catalog. Its a black beret. Fits well and I add pins to the fron to dress it up. It was reasonably priced. I thing about $16. I got a wiglet thing that I can attach to the edges and just a bit of hair shows. It can be a little itchy but its good for quick stops when I don't want a full wig but don't want stairs. I think it was $25. Something like this might work for you when its hot if you can find a lightweight hat or scarf to connect it to. I hope this helps, Annie",

Was you MO ever called while you were in the ER or admitted? I really hope those symptoms are gone.  I'm concerned because of an experience I had. Fine on Monday with some tiredness and needing to rest and breathe if I climbed two flight of stairs in my house. Tues am didn't feel great but decided to got to work for a short day to finish up a must do task and then rest (involved a 3 hour commute to NYC) but got the desk cleared and assigned out new stuff in case I was out sick a day. Wed felt awful with SOB and tightness in chest and put off going to doc/ER. Thursday in ER and ended up 12 days in the hospital. Drained  6 liters of fluid from lung and pericardial sac. Didn't know till later but I was watched in ICU in case they need to go in as an emergency because my heart rate was so low from the fluid build up. I don't mean to scare you but altho the build up must have been happening for a while (it had been a about two months since prior scan) things changed drastically in the space of 3 days. My onc couldn't believe it. Oh and I never returned to work. Good thing I cleaned off the desk huh. (headslap).  If they can't do a CT can they do another test without dye? Xray or sonogram or MRI? Let us know what the follow up is. And if you ever run into panic attack doc again, please request anyone else if possible.  Hugs, Annie",

That will never be the case for me.  I don't have the energy for all the things  I did before, I need to schedule my life around appointments and how I'll feel after treatment. Making long term plans is difficult (or pointless in the case of very long term plans as I won't be here.) To me it has a context of trying to make others feel better about our sucky situation. Well, I feel like cancer has become my life and how I am defined now. Calling it a journey just amplifies that feeling and gives it even more importance and that what came before is over and not how I am viewed by others anymore.   As to the battle/warrior terminology, I'm not crazy about that either. I don't mind 'fight' so much but I would cringe if someone called me a warrior.  All that being said, I may not use those words, but when other people with cancer or their families do it doesn't bother me. If it works for them that is great. It doesn't affect me. It's like the 'dumb things people have said to you thread'. I've had a few doozies, but most were from a place of people trying to help, so while I may shake my head at those comments, they don't make me mad. Of course comments that are not well intentioned or from medical professionals who should know better are a different story. ",

My onc was helpful in filling out the forms for this properly to make sure this was granted. Was on STD through my job for 6 months. The insurance company that my firm uses took care of transitioning me to LTD and outsourced my SSDI applications at no charge as well. So you don't get SSDI untill he STD is done. We started the SSDI application before LTD kicked in and it will take a while for it to be finally approved. They will pay back to the effective date. Because I was a 'high wage earner', the amount I get in SSDI is deducted from my LTD. So the first SSDI payment is deposited into an a account and I won't touch it until the insurance company takes the reimbursement. I chose to go for the SSDI even though I end up with the same total payment because my daughter will also get SSDI and it will be set up when I die and my husband won't have to deal with it. They also help you handle anything that comes up which is helpful. Also, my state, NJ has STD disabiltiy payments. My STD throught he insurance company also deducted that from my STD payment but the handled the whole thing. For people who make less than I did, you may end up with more on STD + state STD and then the LTD + SSDI. Hope this helps. Annie",

They think it may have been an area of DCIS 6 years ago that wasn't picked up on the same side (left). And now is large enought to be found. It is IDC again. ER/PR+. Her2-.  Not sure on size - I'm hearing about 1 cm at this point. It apparently has not spread to any other organs altho an infraclavicular node did light up on the PET scan.Don't know about chemo yet - probably depends on that lymph node. Have a bilateral for peace of mind. There is also something small on the right that they are pretty sure is benign but they couldn't find with the ultrasound for a biopsy.  So I decided today was my deadline for choosing implants or no recon. Since I had rads on my left side 6 years ago, the PS told me that if I don't do recon now, if I ever do it in the future, implants are not likely to be a choice. The skin will just not handle it  between rads and scarring from the mastectomy. I think I'd be okay with no recon but am afraid I'll regret my decision in a year or two and then I'd have to have a DIEP which is a very long surgery and will cut the abdomen. Not crazy about that. Not crazy about silicon or cutting pec muscle either though! I am so not good with ambivalence! I also did some holiday shopping when I went out for some sweat shirts and pants to wear while recovering. I got a bed wedge to help prop me up in bed - easier to get out and one of those pillows with arms (I think they used to call them bed husbands). I haven't had one since college. I heard it help prevent you from rolling over in the night becasue of the arms. I thought I'd try both and see which works better.  Gigi - Marco island - that sounds lovely! Tammy - I'm so glad you had a good time at the party. When I was originally dx, DD was 20 months old. I was still recovering from a second surgery, working full time and about to start chemo on her 2nd bday. Needless to say, we had some cake and that's it. I'm so glad you were able to celebrate. Be back later, Annie",

Rx is for daily insert for 2 weeks and then 1 every two weeks. I needed to do about 4 weeks straight then 2 x per week for 1-2 months and now every 2 weeks. I hate the replens but used it at the beginning altho now I don't. It would probably help but i hate the goopieness. The other important change for me was getting the Hitachi magic wand.

The rest is responding to others posts since my last post 1 month ago.  I was in the hospital for a few days (discovered brain mets) for those who don't know. Rads completed and feeling better but still very fatigued and not thinking totally clearly. Had lots of family support so good. Kite - so sorry you are in pain. I hope you get relief soon.  Diane - so sorry everyone is so sick. That is awful. I hope you are all on the mend now.  Kjones and Kebab - the Camp Kesem reunion is this weekend. Parents stay.Let you know how it goes. You know I was nervous about sending her in August. some of the kids parents had died. Finding out the liver mets exploded in late August and ending up in in the hospital in Sept with brain mets, I am so thankful she went. She's going to need more support going forward I think. I think someone is looking out for me. :) Kjones - congrats on stable! SusaninSF - I totally agree that many others have it worse. I at least got to a live a life. When I hear of young people struck down by illness or dealing with a horrible situation in life  it puts it in perspective for me.  Starbrightly - my DD is 11.5. She has been a real trooper during my recent setback. She also met one of the therapists at the hospital and really liked her.  With regard to all that social drama I always remind her that in the Nick show Ned's Declassified, the trio of best friends are two boys and a girl. There are episodes where the girl tries to be more girly and make friends with girls. It's actually a pretty good show with good values. They are old and all in repeats. I think my 23 yr old used to watch them when they were new. She's doing better and was recently invited to a youth group thing on Friday nights. She went and had a great time. Made me really happy. Romansma - I love that you had a nice weekend with DH. Excellent.  Fugimam-your kids are beautiful. :) Welcome. Iamstonger Culberta - welcome to you two too. Hey did you see that. I used all the word 2 in one sentence. :) Kite - love that hospital pic. You are so cute and the hair is cute too. I know you might not want to hear that about the hair. :) I hope they get your pain addressed soon. Our family guilty pleasure is Chick-Fil-A.  Chicken sandwiches with extra pickles and if we are really decadent a shake. Funny story, DH thought it was pronounced chicfaluh since he was teenager and one day I said it when we passed one when we were in our 30's. He couldn't believe he had been pronouncing it wrong all those year. Now we all pronounce it the wrong way on purpose.  Halloween costumes. The year DD was 9 she was Bacon. Girl loves her bacon. I made it out of foam, spray paint etc. Hard to walk in but it was the bomb. She didn't win a prize at the school party and all the kids were chanting that she was robbed! (But the one that one was pretty amazing and deserved it I thought). I put a lot of effort into it and I'm glad I did cause I couldn't after. It was right before I went Stage IV. For 10 yrs she went as Medusa. Her big sis went as medusa as a kid too. Our family likes all the greek and roman mythology stuff. She picked out cool fabric with swirly greens and brassy dots. When pinned a toga and I put rubber snakes in her hair with bobby pins. Green face paint, glityz brooches, sunglasses,  etc. I'll try and post pics of these. This year she is going as Korra from Legend of Korra. (avatar cartoon on nick). I found a description of a way to make it inexpensively with no sewing (I can't sew!) from a blog. I'll post around Halloween. If I missed anybody - sorry. Just wanted to catch up with everything on this thread and BCO in general.  Annie",

I'll probably be spending more time in the surgery section in the next couple of weeks. This is the hardest decision I've ever made. I know everyone says you can choose to recon later but because I've had rads previously the PS said immediate or not if I'm doing implants. Of the flap surgeries, I'd only do a diep and I really don't want a long involved surgery with possibilty of fat necrosis causing alarms and I don't want any other body sections without sensation.

I've read your other posts. :)  I think it is right for me. I'm 48 (in a few weeks) and married for 13 years. If I was much younger or single I think I would have gone for recon and possibly a uni.  Meglove - funny on the pics of your daughter. I have a 19 yr old stepdaughter who i've known since she was 4 - I think she'd faint if she saw by boobs! :)I think I'll have DH take some pics for me - even with my lopsided leftie from my previous lumpectomey, re-excision, surgical biopsy and rads. ;) Sherry - thanks for your reply. I don't think I realize that you did no recon. When I'm on the Stage III thread, we don't talk the surgery so much. BTW, I think I still 'qualify' as Stage III this go round LOL, so I'll be around there too.  Kerry - my wonderful DH said to me - so you'll spend a lot of money on tailoring and getting things sewn into your favorite things so you don't need to think about it instead of money on co-pays and other surgery related expenses. He knows I'm the type to not spend the money on myself/clothes! Its funny - the suit is probably one of the first things I'll do. Carol - I like that non-conventional. I've read some of your other posts and know you run. I've done a few mini-tris (Danskin, Jerseygirl) but I'm still outta shape! Whenever I see your log in I think of you as living in Clark, NJ. :)  Jenn - thanks for your note. Sometimes it feels like the ladies who choose not to do recon always knew how they felt or maybe had a bad reconstruction experience. Its good to hear about folks who were really on the fence and are at peace with their decisions (at least so far. ;) ) NMI and Badger and Barbara- thanks for your kinds words.  Night all, Annie",

I usually sat in a chair in full sight of the nurses station but that section was full that day so I sat on the other end of the room. About 5 min in my face felt hot, my throat started to close up and I felt really weird. I realized what was happening and tried to catch the nurses attention. They were either engaged with someone else or out of my line of sight. I was about to panic, caught the eye of a fellow patient, pointed at my throat and mimiced not being able to breath. She got the nurses attention and within about 10 seconds I had 3 nurses on me administering epinephrine. The whole thing too maybe 25 seconds but felt like minutes. So then my onc comes in and says, we'll put you on taxotere, do you want to get it today and keep close to schedule? I admit I was relieved thinking it was no biggy but she told me months later it was because she wanted as much chemo in me as possible as soon as possible due to my stage! Anyway sorry for the long story. I haven't had the desesitization protocol. but then again I didn't vomit or have diahrea, so my reaction probably wasn't as serious.   With regard to the private room or room full of patients - I was able to choose my hospital and decide between the two types. i chose the public room. I liked the idea of being with other people even though I just read novels during chemo. Given the reaction I had, I think it worked out best for me.  Susan - I wish you all the best and hope that everything goes smoothly with the desensitiation.   Annie DX 11/04 Stage IIIC 11/20 nodes, 6mm, Grade 2, ER+/PR+ Her2-",

ER+/PR+ Her2- like before. Going in for all my tests but we don't expect to see any mets. I'll be having a mastectomy. My onc thinks it was an area of DCIS that was always in the breast. Since it was pre-cancer 6 years ago, the chemo would not have killed it since it would not have the characteristics that would make it susceptible to chemo.  I need to decide if I want to remove the 'good' breast as well. Any feedback from you ladies appreciated on that. Also, commentary on whether to have recon or not. I've been reading those forums this week, but would appreciate your input. I'm leaning towards bilateral with no recon. I'm concernced about lympedema on the 'good' side but also concerned about another recurrence in the future and the possibility of not catching it as early or needing chemo again.  Thanks, Annie Stage IV 8/2012 Liver, brain, bone, mets.

Your cousin IT comment cracked me up. My really old wig is getting ditched. The color is weird. I can't believe now I ever wore it! I have one from round two of baldness that I think should do okay. I got it from American Cancer Society TLC catalog. It is a monofilament wig and the quality is good for the price. I really hate wigs as I find them itchy but my daughter is in middle school now so I don't want her peers thinking of her as the kid with the sick/bald mother. The social worker gave me a cool item. It's a baseball cap with hair 'built in' . It looks like a page boy and is close to my color. I think I'll be wearing that the most as it didn't itch and felt cool. Unfortunately I have a family wedding coming so I'll have to wig out for that. My hair started really shedding yesterday but the wedding shower is next Saturday so I'm holding on to what I've got for at least another week. ",

Of the flap surgeries, I'd only do a diep and I really don't want a long involved surgery with possibilty of fat necrosis causing alarms and I don't want any other body sections without sensation.

      "Content": "Nov 23, 2010 09:04AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 06:15AM by Annie62 Eileen - I was the same way but fortunately DH was the only one privvy to my decisions. I have gotten some extremely strong encouragement from family and docs to do recon, but I feel it is because they think that I am young and will regret this in the end - say 1-2 years out. I finally realized that a large part of me thought I might be making a big mistake. That did it. Carla - I hear ya on the feeling about having to make a quick decision. Everyone says you can do it later if you want and that's true for most. Since I had rads before, implants are out for me unless I do it now and I don't want to do the other more intense surgical procedures. Worst case if I do decide later on recon I could do a DIEP and deal with additional scars. So I really felt I needed to make a quick decision. I was dx 10/4 so this has been dragging. Thinking about PS delayed my surgery 2-3 weeks but that's okay since I feel like I had time to think about things more. Here are some of the things that helped me decide. First I would pick a day or two and imagine myself having chosen one path. I tried to imagine myself living with a really good outcome on implants and waking up and looking at myself in the mirror, walking round, swimming, laying in bed. Then I would imagine the same with no recon and a slightly less than optimal flat appearance. Dealing with foobs, swimming etc. Wearing summer clothes. That visulization really helped a lot. DH noted that I (actually both of us) tend to overemphasize negative risks and underemphasize potential benefits. We are both pretty risk averse. So I tended to think that I'll be the one with complications from implants and the one with giant dog ears after no recon! I tried to be as balanced as possible when thinking about this stuff. We mostly hear the negatives on this board and when we do get people happy, they tend to be more recent. The happy campers aren't posting about their recon 5-10 years after for the most part.  Pros for deciding no implants: no followups to track potential ruptures in implant, avoid capsular contraction (sp?), avoid additional surgeries and anesthesia, avoid cutting pectoral muscle.  No foreign body in my body. Pros for deciding for implants: no dealing with prosthesis, not looking at my body flat and scarred from mx, I think I might feel younger with them, daily reminder of what I have given up to cancer. In the end, I decided that I think about cancer and how it has affected me every day since October 2004 when I was dx the first time. Looking at myself flat wasn't going to change that. As this is a recurrence and I have density in my breasts and there is something small on the other side they can't see and my cancer likes to travel (already in lymph nodes with small cancer),  getting bilateral was an easier decision for me - but still not easy! I wish I didn't have to give up sensation but being able to work out with a prosthesis and not worrying about posture problems if I end up not liking prosthesis on a daily basis AND the peace of mind is worth the trade off. My breast were never the main part of my sex life anyway- especially since the first go around. FWIW, I'm 48, a small b cup and pear shaped too. I was worried about looking totally out of balane top to bottom. Its just another inspiration to lose the last few pounds I've been working on. I think if I was younger and/or single, I would do recon. If I was much older it would have been an easier decision to say no. But that's for me of course.  In closing - I think its great we have choices despite having to make them in such stressful circumstances. If all people wanted the same things the world would be a boring place. Just wish my life were a little more boring right now! Annie",

I was having trouble figuring out what I want so I'm doing the following. I live for 24 hrs assuming I've made a certain decision and seeing how I feel about that. I 'decided' last night on bilateral with no recon. So far I'm feeling pretty good about it. Tomorrow, I may try to imagine that I've made a decison for unilateral with no recon, or with an implant. See how I feel about that. I know this sounds a little crazy but it works for me. I'm don't deal with well with uncertainty when I have to make a decision. Once I know what I want I'm general, I'm much better dealing with whatever gets thrown at me. Thanks again all. Annie",

My onc explained that the mets on the pleura don't show up on CT or PET scans because they are so small. So in the space of a month I've gone from maybe 1 spinal met and 2-3 small liver mets, to many bone mets, the liver mets and pleural mets. And I'm off falsodex and onto chemo. I was so hoping for a long run on faslodex since its a pretty easy regimen. I'm the breadwinner in my household and the my job has the insurance so I'm starting to get scared. I was in a pretty good place 2 weeks ago thinking I could have many years and see my 9 year old grow up although I had given up on dreams of retirement. Now I don't even know if I'll see my little one get through middle school. Not sure what chemo I'll be on. The onc is meeting with me after I've healed from the drains a bit more to disucss options. She's mentioned Xeloda, Navelbine, platinum drugs, and CMF as options so far. I've had Adriomycin/Cytoxin/ Taxotere (2004) and Gemzar and Abraxane (2011). In the past keeping my hair wasn't a consideration but I really don't want to be known and the Stage IV cancer woman in all aspects of my life for the rest of my life right now. But we'll see. Thanks for 'listening'. The past two days have been really hard. I spent half the day crying yesterday thinking the surgeon forgot about coming to release me from the hospital.

I think you handled it well. I don't know if I could have been that calm in the moment.  My 11 year old had said things like your 6 year old. I explain that I'll always be on medicine and won't be able to do everything I did before (like skiing) but I can do a lot and that thankfully the medicine is working. I also tell her that I will let her know if things change but that she doesn't need to worry. I don't inform her of every little change in my treatment. For the most part this has worked.  I also wanted to let everyone know how Camp Kesem went for my daughter. Camp Kesem is a sleepaway camp that has chapters across the US and is run by college students. The camp is free and for children and teens who either have or had a parent with cancer. The focus is on giving the kids a fun week away from cancer. My daughter went to camp for a week and loved it. She has been to YMCA sleepaway camps and loved those too but I was worried about this one because of the cancer connection. Once towards the end of the week, there is a one-hour session where the campers can talk about anything they like or not talk at all. My daughter said she cried because some of the kids had lost a parent. She told me she shared how scared she was when I was in the hospital for 10 days with pleural effusions but that \"I'm better now\".  Despite this she said she wants to go back because the rest of the time was so much fun. They did a lot of group activities including skits, talent shows etc in addition to swimming, wall climbing, archery, arts and crafts and games. It seems to me there was more focus on group activities and working together supplemented by individual challenges than at her YMCA camp which is more about individual accomplishment (say wall climbing) supplemented by group stuff. Both approaches are good for her but she really loved Camp Kesem and even made a new good friend.  She also told me some of the other campers stories and combined with some of the parents I saw, many seemed to have a decent quality of life so its not like every kid there has a parent who has a short time left or has died. I explained to her before she went that there are lots of types of cancer and that some are worse than others and some have more treatments available than others and that I'm doing fine. For my part, I think it's good for her to have a place where she can be open about what's going on at home and know there are others like her. She doesn't know anyone else who has a family member with cancer.  If anyone has questions about Camp Kesem, feel free to PM me. ",

DH is great but this is not his strong point. I keep reminding her that having a wide circle of friends with some being the closest is a good way to be because at this age your friendships can often change and maintaining a wider social circle makes those changes easier to weather. I suspect she's trying to hard with certain kids and driving them away. I know its part of learning in life but one year after a 2 yr bestie dropped her she really had an awful year trying re-establish herself with new friends. Thank goodness for moving up to middle school which helped with meeting new folks. Her best friend for a while was a boy but she really wants a best friend whose a girl.  Sigh.",

(altho liver function is still pretty normal). Spent the week feeling awful with impossible constipation. (sorry for the tmi). Last Tuesday night while watching tv with my family I felt my right side go numb. Totally scary. Ambulance comes, no stroke or heart attack but they think perhaps a reaction to new meds. I insisted on being taken to the emergency room. The pains in my right side prompted a CT scan and I found out I have brain mets. Small diffuse ones with one or two slightly larger. Swelling around the lesions was causing the tremors/pins/needles on my right side. You can imagine the shock. At one point I couldn't speak or was speaking poorly but a seizure has pretty much been ruled out thankfully.  My poor 11 yr old and DH were pretty freaked. DH has pretty much fallen apart. Spent 3 days in the hospital, have started whole brain rads which the docs seem pretty optimistic about. They think my mets are small enough to go away. I'm praying they are right. Off chemo until rads are done. I can't drive and I'm pretty tired. Not driving is really annoying and scheduling rides to the hospital and organizing our life has been a real pain. Last week I was totally out of it but doing a bit better this week. Needless to say I've sliced a few years off my life expectancy this week. I just hope I'm around for a couple of more years at least. I hope I can get back to my 'normal' in a month or so. If not, I really can't imagine how I'm going to move forward.  I'll be around more but typing is actually kind of hard so I'll check in on you guys when I can.

I find out for sure on Wednesday when I meet with my onc.  Its nerve wracking to know that there was lots of cancer that wasn't picked up on mammo, ultrasound, mri, ct, pet because they tell me the cancer hasn't spread to other organs.

I too was nervous about DD 'realizing' things might be worse than she thought. But she knows that I have cancer and that there are different kinds of cancer that affect different parts of the body, some are worse than others and that I am lucky to have medicines to keep me 'healthy' and sometimes that doesn't happen with cancer. That being said, she also knows that we have told her that if the medicine stops working then we will tell her. According to the camp literature the point of the camp is that they 'get away from cancer' and can be normal kids. Durng the 5 days, they have 1 session of an hour where the campers can talk about anything on their minds but they don't have too. I've already talked to DD about that part.  Also, she went to sleep away camp the first time at age 9. (not including girl scout camping trips). I was nervous but she begged and then she loved it. Both her dad and I were working full time at the time so it was good coverage while we worked. She goes for 2 weeks. Now that I'm not working she would be crushed if she couldn't go. She talks about camp and the counselors and kids all  year and sings the songs. So she goes even though I'm home. The camp is reasonable and for now we can afford it. ",

(He shaves his own head). I wish I had gone to a professional for the shave - it would have been a closer shave. I always had a bit of stubble right above my neck in the back.  I had great anti-naseau drugs (kytril and emend). Two days after chemo my stomach was 'off' but never enough to get sick. I stuck to water and toast those days. I had one taxol treatment and had an allergic response at the 2nd so I was switched to taxotere. They are similar but I understand taxol is a little easier to handle re: SEs. Muscle/bone pain was bad for 1 to 1.5 days each treatment. I stayed on the couch. Otherwise okay. I had no stomach sensitivity on that. My brows stayed in until taxotere was almost finished and that helped appearance wise. Dusting a little eyeshadow the color of your hair onto your brows helps give a frame to the face and is more subtle than an eyebrow pencil. My hair was already started to come back while on Taxotere.  Overall the fatigue of chemo is cumulative. I was beat by the end and did throw up once. I was feeling okay and commuted to the office (about 1.5 hrs on public transportation) and got sick when I arrived. Turned around and went home by car service. So try to take it easier as it progresses. I highly recommend the port. Why don't they want to give you one? I had one and will be getting one this time around as well. It was a very short procedure that you stay away for (but sedated).  I have a wig. I went for similar color but long and wavy and sexy! I need to dig it out. I may restyle into a shorter style to keep things simple this time around. I had days I couldn't keep it on my head because it bothered me but it worked when I had meetings or when I went to a big bash during treatment. I couldn't keep scarves on my head - they slipped off. I wore some hats but I have a big head LOL and it was hard to find comfortable ones that fit. I'm not a fan of baseball caps. I wore a velvet turban at home in winter when it was cold (and used to walk around saying 'I'm ready for my close up Mr. DeMille), a nice handknit watch cap hat at the office and just went bald in summer. My office is casual and I could get away with that.   Best to everyone. Zogo hope you get some satisfaction with the skin graft area. I'm thinkingof you. Annie",

Sorry about all your back and forth with the PS choice etc. It is so stressful along with all of this other stuff. And I think the docs do so much of this that they just don't get it or figure we'll be stressed anyway so they don't try to minimize it!  I also have been taking time to look at my girls before they are gone. My nipple was showing thru a pj top this weekend and I got wistful. This is kind of surreal. I've encouraged DH to enjoy them before they are gone (said more sensitively LOL) but he's freaked out by everything. I've put some food in the freezer, talked to my whole family, let the school/troop leaders know. Glad that is done. Got a MAJOR thing accomplished. The 7 (almost 8 yr old) has been late compared to her friends to ride a two-wheeler. DH has been no help in practicing with her. I decided it better happen now because I won't be able to help her for such a long time. So I took her out last week (training wheels off) and I was running along with her. She was doing much better so yesterday I insisted we all go up to the school lot which is nice and wide and practice. Success! She is so excited and I'm so happy for her. Phew, that's done! We also went to the beach and went kite flying. The last couple of times, the wind hasn't been cooperating. It was beautiful. Very cold, but sunny, gusty winds for exciting flying (dips, loops, etc not just sitting there), watched the crazy surfers and hit a new playground. Getting all my good mommy stuff in. Even played Wii Mario which I hate. LOL. I've also been organizing the closets, medicine chests etc to make stuff easier for DH. It's been theraputic for me too.   Hang in there all, Annie ",

Had some wine tonight with dinner and feeling in a better frame of mind.  Sharon - I agree with you post. 6 yrs ago I had a lumpectomy and nodes removed. I was in a lot of pain and was sick for days; needed pain killers. This time around very little pain and I had a bmx nd no nodes. I think with the bmx nerves get cut and you are numb and fell less pain and I guess the node area causes more pain. hang in there everyone Annie",

It may result in a confirmation of your doctors treatment plan. My onc wouldn't even care about the lymph nodes unless they were the only mets I had.  I think what they are saying about the bone mets is that you could be seeing healing not worsening. As long as I didn't have pain and my blood counts were good and/or there wasn't an obvious large scale worsening of the bone mets, my onc wouldn't pay much attention to that and would focus on the liver/lung mets.   Questions I would ask the doctor:  -After the next scan if a similar level of progression was seen would he change treatment? If yes, then he is toeing the line because he thinks this was always there and just not seen on the prior scan. -Ask what treatment  options he's considering if after the next scan there is progression. That way you can do some research ahead of time.  - In your liver and lungs, is this considered a low volume of disease. 8mm is pretty small but it depends on how many there are.  Good luck. You'll need to gather all your records for the second opinion which can be a pain but I found mine gave me peace of mind that my treatment plan was a good one. Annie",

It is an easy chemo as far as I'm concerned. No hair loss, no appetitie issues (I even had them stop the anti-naseau meds which constipated me). My white counts are sometimes a little low at the second week and I've had neulasta shots once or twice. Some fatigue and when I climb a lot of stairs I can feel it. If I was working the fatigue might be much more of an issue. I had initally very good results - bone mets appear stable, lung under control and liver seemed stable. Last scan saw mixed response in liver - some smaller, some bigger, and a new lesion. Onc keeping me on since bones/lungs doing well and I'm tolerating this very well. That's why we added faslodex. I hope this works for you and that you find it do-able SE-wise. In terms of future chemos, I see you haven't done Halaven. Is that an option for you? I don't believe it is in pill form. ",

I can't believe how well. I haven't had to take 1 painkiller since my bmx with no recon. I threw up a little after drinking water while still at hospital but nothing since Tuesday. Compared to my lumpectomy/axillary dissection 6 yrs ago this is a cake walk! Last time lots of pain and was vomiting for days. I guess it was mostly due to the  anesthesia and pain meds. I told them this time how I reacted. They gave me a motion sickness patch in pre-op and I think that really helped. I did take vicodin at bedtime, not so much for pain but to make me drowsy to help me fall asleep.Believe it or not, I've actually been on work email since Wednesday! Worst problem so far is that I'm itchy. I get a little dizzy occasionally. Will wash up a bit today (sponge bath only) and I'm looking forward to that. Best to everyone else in the group. I hope your recovery goes as well as mine is so far.  Annie",

I read the reviews and there were many that were unhappy saying that the pockets have an opening at the top which means you can see the form. I can't even imagine that. Anyway I didn't order one and I'm doing a search online for a suit. Another option is to have pockets sewn into a regular suit. Nordstroms will do it. if you don't buy the suit from them they charge $12 which is very reasonable. TLC sells the 'pockets' if you can sew or you could bring them to a tailor.  Annie ",

I'm doing well health-wise and have been getting back into shape the last year or so. The only continuing negative side effect is that chemopause killed my libido and made physical relations with DH uncomfortable. I am working on that and have seen some slight improvement. Thanks to the mojo thread for its suggestions.  I still think about cancer almost every day. I rarely post because I'm trying to stop thinking about it everyday. I look at my almost 7 year old and realize I hardly remember the year she was two when I was undergoing treatment. I don't want it to take away any more of my mental energy than necessary.  My bc WAS discovered on a mammogram -my second one. I had a baseline 2 years prior and then missed a year when pregnant. I had 6 micro-calcifications and all the professionals involved in my case were amazed that the radiologist found them. I had the option of wait and see or biopsy  - I was borderline re: the # of calcifications. I wanted them out and thank goodness I did. The cancer was small but had spread to 11/19 lymph nodes.   Since then I had a lumpectomy with re-excision for clean margins, axillary dissection, chemo (TAC), rads, tamoxifen for 3 years, on aromasin now. I had a clear surgical biopsy the year after my treatment (more calcifications) which were likely caused by the initial surgery. My breast is pretty mishapen. Last year I had to have D&C for uterine build-up from tamoxifen. The biopsy cam back negative. So I'm doing well with almost annual reasons to worry. :)  I wish you all the best and look forward to reading your '5 (or more!) year out' posts in the future. :) Best, Annie Stage IV 8/2012 Liver, brain, bone, mets.
