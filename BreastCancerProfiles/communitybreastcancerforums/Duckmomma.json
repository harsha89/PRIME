I just wish all of this would be resolved before I go visit my family in Florida next week. I haven't been since I moved three years ago.i really don't want to be on antibiotics when I go, since I'm planning on going to ladies night with my friends and haven't been out since I moved. By last night it was a lot more swollen and and the nipple is now acting wonky (maybe because of the swelling) They were flat to begin with, and now that one is indented on the bottom. The rash pinkness/redness hasn't changed at all. If they get me the referral early enough today, I can see about getting an appt today or tomorrow so I can go ahead and move forward. Stupid boob. Also super cranky, yesterday morning I was awoken at 4am by a child getting sick in my bathroom, half asleep I ask him if he flushed the toilet and he says \u201coh, you think I puked in the toilet\u201d of course not why would I think that, no it was the floor in front of it. Thought i would catch up last night, wrong again! Cat knocked a glass of water on my head at 4am. Couldn\u2019t go back To sleep. I totally get those old Calgon commercials, calgon take me away",

Curiously I kinda remember having an issue (I think it was a lump that hurt) in the same spot on this breast a couple of years ago before my hysterectomy, mentioned it to the gyn and they felt it and attributed it to hormones, I think they thought it was fibrous or something, so I never thought about it again until now (I had bigger issues to worry about like ovarian cysts and endometriosis on my kidneys and diaghrahm). I haven't been on the estrogen replacement in 9 months, so I\u2019m pretty sure im hormone free, nothing to do but wait and see what\u2019s happens when I finish the medicine",

I normally don\u2019t entirely freak out, I initially thought the rash was a bug bite from working in the garden, when it didn\u2019t go away after a few days I googled insect bites on breast and up comes ibc. After that it had started to swell but I wasn\u2019t worried enough to make an appt (don\u2019t want to be a nervous nelly) so I waited until my physical. After being diagnosed with mastitis, I was dumbfounded, so I googled non lactational mastitis and bam there was ibc again. I freaked out a little because odds are almost never in my favor, I ended up with the rare complications from endometriosis, it\u2019s extrememly rare for it to grow outside of the reproductive system, and I have read studies that endometriosis increases your risk of cancers like breast cancer, but they can\u2019t explain why. I wish google would blast endometriosis like it does ibc, so women wouldn\u2019t spend years with unexplained pain while their fertility is destroyed. Although I suppose if it helps even one woman who has ibc go get her issue checked out early enough, it can\u2019t be all bad. Still no change for me, it seems like it is pinker, and that is covering more area. IT is still swollen, it doesn\u2019t look engorged it just looks perky, while the uneffected breast is its normal gravity driven self. It\u2019s like an 18 yr old breast and almost 40 year old nursed two kids breast mounted on the same chest. (Sorry for the visual). I\u2019m going to finish the medicine, which will be Done on Sunday, but if there is no change by wednesday, I\u2019m going going call the doctor back about the tests. I\u2019m going out of town next week to see my family and would feel better ruling out cancer before I leave.

I can't imagine if I was actually trying to fix some lumpy gravy. Yeah same here with the love hate. I hate paying copays so I usually google to see if it warrants going to the dr and paying a copay. Most of the time I ignore it. I've got enough issues with my body to be looking for more.",

Two nights in a row with little sleep, almost all rationality goes to the wind. The kid threw up all morning yesterdaythen was his normal self the rest of the day, no idea what caused it, no fever. He went to school today.",
