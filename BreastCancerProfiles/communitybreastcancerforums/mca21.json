Last year they found something on my mammo and gave me an ultrasound and they saw someting.  I had it aspirated and it ended up being a cyst. Two years ago I had a stereostatic biopsy because of what they saw and said it was solid.  That ended up being benign. I guess my question is why a diagnostic mammogram this time instead of a screening one.  Should I be worried. Log in to post a reply",
