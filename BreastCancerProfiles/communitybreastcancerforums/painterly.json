I had a terrible rash on the 1st round and I was told that it was acne; they gave me a cortisone to use but warned me to use it sparingly as it would inter-act with the chemo. I was so afraid to have an inter-action that I did only use it sparingly. Consequently, I had this darn acne for over a year before it finally disappeared. Am wondering now if it was shingles. I had a powerful drug interaction from the nupogen injections (to replace white  blood cells) that it felt  as though someone was violently kicking me in the back and I fell off the couch in pain.  So this is the reason why I was afraid to use the cortisone. Then I got another interaction from the nupogen that my body started making white blood cells like crazy and the onc. phoned me to quit using the nupogen. I sure hope we don't have to go through this crap again. The public is so complacent about breast cancer treatment that they think it is no big deal now with really excellent treatments and that it is well and truly under control and no one dies from it blah blah blah. Better end here before I tie my knickers into a huge knot.LOL",

I quickly learned that durex was a \"safe\" or prophelactic for sex whereas durex in Australia was scotch tape...hahaha. I have no idea if Australians still call scotch tape Durex. I left Australia in the late 60's so ideas no doubt have since changed. About the breast feeding.

If you were there as a child, our paths may have crossed:  you as a child and me as a teenager. I fondly look back at this period in my life, those carefree days enjoying the sun and sand and the magnificent colour of ocean and sky.

(Quoted from Beesie). So very true, but it is difficult for us to make such informed decisions when we are given so little time to evaluate the info given. I was given something like 2 weeks to make a decision re: mx or lump. plus rads. Newly diagnosed women are like nocturnal animals that come out of the woods and are caught in the glare of oncoming headlights and are subsequently frozen on the spot. I recognise newly diagnosed women all the time with that same look that I had. Looking back, I would opt out of radiation. I got se's from it and have to deal with sensitive lungs. I have had numerous tests but according to my lung doctor, radiation most probably has created this lung sensitivity. So when I had a new primary in the opposite breast I knew I couldn't do the radiation and just did lump no rads. But later decided prophylactic was the best decision for me. I took no pain killers for the BMX as I am sensitive to drugs. I detested the drains. I have a tightness in my chest that I am slowly getting used to.  I have lost mobility on the radiation side, but according to my PT, I happen to be someone with more flexibility than the average person, and should be thankful for what I have. Doing the BMX was a good decision for me. I no longer have to have scans. I bought  junior bras that I inserted A cup silicone foobs. I really like these bras. My biggest fear was that they would ride up during my golf swing. But no, these little bras just stay in place. My reduction risk has been reduced to something like 1% and with no longer having scans I feel that I have finally been able to move on. I decided against the recon. mainly because it is more surgery but if I were younger, I would go for it. The BMX op.was psychologically, a weight off my shoulders, or should I say chest! But not to promote breast removal, I must add that I am 68 years old and my age makes the whole process different from the younger women who are faced with similar decisions.",

When the node came back from more testing showed an isolated tumour cell.  My onc  said 4 rounds of chemo. He didn't give me an oncotype test. When I asked him on a future visit why I didn't get an oncotype he said that they don't test tiny tumours. I had the 4 rounds of chemo (played competitive golf throughout the ordeal), followed by radiation. When it came to taking the 5 year pill, I had serious problems after 6 months, so looking back it was probably wise for me to have done chemo. Regards, Glenis",
