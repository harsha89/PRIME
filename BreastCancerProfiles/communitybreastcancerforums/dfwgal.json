From the information above, I may need to have Milk of Mag at the house so I don't have issues from the pain meds.  Vis, sorry you received more bad news, but the good news is it is now caught and can be treated appropriately. You may want to cut your hair short now to make adapting a little easier. Maybe start with shoulder length, then in a week or 2 go to a bob. Hugs to all my December sisters.",

Covers midthigh to shoulders. the bra area is comfortable and doesnt press on the noob. Only thing I am adjusting to is seeing the noob standing up perky like a 20 yo and the old boob hanging to the waist..lol ( I was a D before this so imagine the sag). Once the noob heals enough, the nipple will be added then the old boob will get lifted and shaped to match. Abdomen incision still sore but healing well. Belly button looks cute too. Once the swelling is all gone, I am thinking a 2 piece swimsuit will be in my future. After all this, I plan to show the world I have a beautiful body despite BC/MX.  I am new and improved :) Arlene, let me know if your sister is more comfortable with questions off the board and I can send my e-mail too. SK  hoping you lose the drains soon. I will dance for you. It feels so much better. Sending prayers to Jacquline and Paula that their recover is doing welll and hope to see them in the recliner brigade soon. HUGS to all my Dec Sisters!",

I can turn in a coupon for a whole hour of \"poor pitiful me\" and she will empathize and hug me. Once the hour is up, I have to focus on all the positives again. Sounds like today would be a good day for you to use a coupon. :) Talk about feeling silly-I have a bed sore on my butt from living in a jack knife position. It is in a position that is very hard to reach. So after a shower, I have to place a dressing with ointment on a chair, and with the help of a hand held mirror, lower myself onto the dressing to the sore. When you need a laugh, this of that visual.  LOL  All we can do is laugh at the little things that try to throw us off keel. I will send you a few extra prayers today and positive vibes for better days to come.",

Welcome to the world of recliners Paula.  Still waiting to hear from Jacq on how her procedure went.  Missing a breast is a concept to adapt to. I know I have a mound from the DIEP but it still doesn't seem like \"my breast\". I am still on egg shells about it until I know all the chances for it to die are gone. Not sure when the final blessing on it will be but remain hopeful. I made my follow up appointments for the BS and the PS. Will be more comfortable again after those. And I should be getting the final path report anyday on the mx tissue. Hugs to all.",

After a few days of laying in bed I ended up with a small bed sore, also had a bout of breathing issues where I developed asome atelectasisis. ( Lungs would expand completely) Extra oxygen and movedment then on day 3 I was finally able to get up and out of the bed. Getting up got easier each time but walking like I am 100 years old. Left Mast looks good and the DIEP appears to be taking very well. Strong blood flow, nice color and edges are healing well. The abdomen is what hurts the most.  Hip to hip incision, and we had the muscles tightened while we were in there. BUt once healed I know things will be much much better.  Thanks for all the thoughts. Good Luck Jac and Paula. you day is appraoaching soon so warm thoughts in advance.  Hugs to all",

However, the nurse did great and continued on like I was a normal patient. I also promised not to be the worst patient. When all was said and done, they said I was a great patient.
