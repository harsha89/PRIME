I am thin, with no abdominal fat to create one breast. two opinions would have my capsule removed, neither of them talked about the concavity or the obvious sternum/rib look that would appear with out some reconstruction. I am not a candidate for free flap lat dorsi. Now my only option now is looking at a gracilis free flap from the inner thigh. Even there the fat is only enough for an A cup. I am single with no partner to see my inner beauty. How is anyone with a tug procedure faring? Using my own tissue seems the right way to go if they alternative is to look like a skeleton with tissue paper over the chest. blue flower Dx 1994, DCIS, 1cm, Grade 1, ER-/PR- Log in to post a reply",
