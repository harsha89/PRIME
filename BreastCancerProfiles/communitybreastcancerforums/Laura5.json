There are many women on these boards who did everything right, did nothing that supposedly carried a bc risk, but here they are, just the same. I asked my doctors this question as well, and they said the same thing, so please don't ever feel guilty. My oncologist at Mayo Clinic where I had my surgery, as well as my oncologist closer to home where I had chemo,  told me that with the discovery of Herceptin, those of us who are Her2+, have the same if not slightly better odds. Chemo is no fun, but really only 4 yucky feeling days each round for me. They have drugs for nausea, and I used cold caps to keep my hair, which made me feel in control of at least one thing. I finished chemo in Dec. and will have my last Herceptin on Thursday, YAY! Herceptin has been a non-issue for me, and I think for the majority of women as well.

Don't know where you live, but I recommend going to a really good hospital/cancer center for her surgery. If your Mom has to undergo chemo, and is concerned about hair loss, there is a cold cap system (Penguin Cold Caps) that you can use during chemo that will keep you from losing your hair. That is terrible that her boss/work is not being sympathetic. She does not need that added stress at this time. Her health needs to be her only concern right now. I think when you first hear that awful news-is the hardest. They will come up with a treatment plan it will get easier to cope. Your Mom is lucky to have you. Good Luck",

I could not stand the thought of one more procedure, or one more reminder. I wanted to be as much like my \"normal\" self as possible. I also chose to use cold caps to keep my hair. After 6 TC treatments and a year of Herceptin, my veins are fine, and I never lost my hair. I am very happy with my decisions. Good luck to you!",
