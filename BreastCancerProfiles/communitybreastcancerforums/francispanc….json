I had a lumpectomy and 21 radiation treatments and am now taking aramid ex. I had a mammogram and ultrasound ordered by my family physician. The mammogram showed NOTHiNG. The ultrasound one week later picked up the tumour and I will always be grateful to my dr. For ordering an ultrasound along with my mammogram because I had dense breasts. My oncologist tells me now that an ultrasound is not necessary for subsequent tests due to the fact that arimidex considerably lessens the density in the breasts. I hope all goes well with your tests! Take care anne",
