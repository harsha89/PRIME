To have spent 13 days petrified, owned by the fear that I had breast cancer--to have reached out to women in this board and on the hotline for affirmation, kindness, understanding, and assurance that my fears didn't make me weak or hysterial. I am forever changed by the last two weeks of my life. Breast cancer will no doubt haunt me again, and perhaps become a part of my life in the future. And now I'm going to do something, anthing, to support women facing this disease. I an not a a survivor  but I was forced to crawl a bit in the trenches, through the footprints of women who were there before me, and I heard their strong voices of power and strength as I lay paralyzed, unable to imagine myself getting up to fight their fight. Being able to come to this group, in the early part of my potential journey down your path, was a life saver for me. And I'm eternally grateful to the kind, intelligent, amazing woman who responded to me and supported me. I wish each of you continued strength and fortitude as you move forward through your treamtents and your history with bs. You are a part of me now and I look forward to figuring out how I can repay, somehow, the kindness you've shown me. Be well, Sharon in Chicago Oh, and Wendy, I was very struck my your posts because my mother also lives in South Elgin, Illinois. She's on Riverside, with the Fox River literally in the backyard.  Log in to post a reply",
