      "Content": "Julia1987 wrote: Hello everyone. My mum (55) has been diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of days ago. As for everyone here it has been a terrible shock for her. I have tried to be as supportive as possible while she waited for the biopsy results. The doctor said the tumor is 2.1 cm and fortunately so far the lymph nodes are clear. He suggested a breast conserving surgery(only tumor taken out with some healthy tissue) and radiation. Although it's not going to be easy for the next couple of months the doctor has said there is an 85% chance she will not need any other treatment and will live her normal life as before.My worry is that my mum has set her next consultation with the breast surgeon in 2 weekes time and surgery in another week from that appointment. This means surgery almost a month after the biopsy. She is saying she needs time to mentally prepare for the surgery and treatment as well as sort out some minor work issues. I am terrified that by the time she has surgery the cancer might spread to the lymph nodes and she will need more radical treatment. Can you please advise whether it is appropriate for me to try and convince her to have surgery earlier? I understand I can not be selfish and say to another person what they should do with their body but I am so afraid of losing her as my grandma on my dad's side died from breast cancer. Thank you!
