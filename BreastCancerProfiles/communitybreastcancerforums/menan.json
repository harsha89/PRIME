IBC is given a compassion SS Disability plus my part time emplyer was sending me home so I went on disability.  I now also have neuopathy in both feet and fingertips so I don't know what jobs I could do.  Plus I sleep alot.  From my support group, the younger ones have more energy and seem to do better on chemo.  I was 59 when I started treatment after my body had been fighting the disease alone for over a year so I came into treatment worn down.",

OC also said we can use Halaven as long as it is working.  And scheduled a PET Scan in 3 weeks to see if it is still working.  I had my last one on June 1 which had some questionable spots in chest cavity/lung. Lack of appetite is a major one for me and I live alone so I wasn't cooking and frozen meals get old.  I signed up for meals on wheels (I'm 61) so I now get to eat one meal without cooking, and I usually have some left for lunch later.  I'm grazing about 6 times a day to control nausea and/or heartburn, except last night when I was eating constantly thanks to the steroid!  I also haven't slept yet! We had a record high of 100 at airport yesterday but the signs downtown said 103-104 and the annual street fair was this week.  A cold front came through so our expected high today is 90! HOTH - don't those low WBC get you!  The clinic is finally calling me to tell me whether I can get chemo the next day even though I have to come in anyway to get the needle out of my port.  Congratulation on the tumor markers!  Keep on Keeping on!",

And had a GREAT time getting to know my cousins again!  BTW one of my probems is yeast in the mouth so I watch my bread (yeast) and sugar (yeast feeds on it) intake.  A cousin at the reunion told me a friend of hers used coke as a mouth rinse to control thrush. It was so good after 2 and a half years of chemo to feel normal!!  After 6 months of remission while on Xeloda, my lung mets returned so I started Halaven in February 2012.  My PET Scan this month showed 4 spots in my right lung area but were not considered cancer so might just be scar tissue. Now after my Cycle 5 back to feeling tired and appetite problems.  Onc halved my dose this time (he had been reducung it all along so now it is a low as it can be) and remarked I couldn't stay on Halaven forever.  The other thing I did was to get meals on wheels since I am over 60.  It helps to not have to decide what to cook.  SOB is not a problem for me unless I climb the 20 steps to my apartment, but that is hard on my sisters too!   Elizabeth, my PA told me to expect problems breathing in this hot humid weather we are all enjoying.  Praying that is the  reason you are noticing  more sob.   Welcome HOTH and Mari55.  I don't often post but I'm cheering for all of us!  We can LIVE with this!!!",

I am triple negative with Inflammatory Breast cancer which currently is active in my lung lymphs.  My onc says his colleagues say they are having good luck with Halavan and TN but I don't see it on this board.  I am really impressed with the attitude of the people on here, it is so upbeat which makes it a joy to read.  Keep it up! ",
