Okay so about two years ago I first noticed a small (very small, maybe the size of a pea) under my armpit but after doing some research I blew it off as an ingrown hair or a cyst and thought nothing of it. A while back I noticed it was still there and now I am beginning to get a little worried only because I know those lumps usually only last for a few weeks, if that. Do you guys think it's worth to see my doctor about it? I am not showing any symptoms that I feel I should be worried about; my cousin just won her battle with breast cancer about a year ago or so but I am sure that's the only person with breast cancer that I know of in my family. What do you guys think? I'm 21 by the way, if that makes a difference in anything. Log in to post a reply",
