PET scan on June 4th revealed brain mets and a tumor in the spinal column, although the Xeloda/Tykerb chemo made good headway on the lung tumors. Started WBR radiation on June 6th, had a vacation, and finished Thursday. Because I developed an infection in my arm, we are not starting chemo again until that is cleared up. We are adding Herceptin back into the mix, and I did an H. drip on Friday. To finally get to the point , My hair had started to grow back nicely, then fell out on the WBR. Will H. keep it from growing back, or was that the taxol I was on earlier? Dx 12/22/2011, Stage IV, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Large DCIS tumor in left breast with very small micro-invasion at stage 1 grade 2 er- pr-. I had stage 2 Hodgkins in 1986 when I was 16, treated with both MOPP chemo and cobalt radiation. Nine years ago I had thyroid problems and had 3/4 of that removed, so the radiation just keeps bringing up issues. Right now we are weighing the decision about chemo. Had an echocardiogram today to assess heart condition and that will certainly contribute to our ultimate decision. The 10 year prognosis looks very promising, but then when we look at the relapse statistics, I am more concerned. Lifelover, I'm with you in that I can't waste energy being angry that 24 years ago the doctors did the best they could and I have been healthy for that long. Right now I just feel like I'm in Vegas and want to do whatever I can to skew the odds in my favor so my now 10 and 7 year olds don't lose their mom before they graduate from high school.",

I am currently on Xeloda and Tykerb after Taxol, Herceptin, and Carboplatin failed. I haven't had a PET yet on the X/T, but I have been feeling better than I had in months, even without steroids. So, when I told my Onc about the redness, I thought it would just be a side-effect of the X. Nope. She suspects that the bc has moved into the skin, which, she says, could be completely independent of the X/T being effective on my other tumors.  Has anyone else dealt with/heard of this? I'm comepletely thrown by it.  Dx 12/22/2011, Stage IV, 0/3 nodes, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I'm sure she will have looked into this and have more ideas when I have my next PET scan on June 4th.",
