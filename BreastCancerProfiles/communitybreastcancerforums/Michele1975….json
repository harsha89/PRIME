I am terrified.  I know that lymph nodes could be swollen for all kinds of reasons. I don't know what comes next, I don't know what kind of questions to ask.  My mom has been great, just she is the \"wait and see\" kind of lady and doens't want to scare me.  I am just looking for guidance. What scared me the most is the look of the lymph node on the ultra sound and mammogram machines.  It looked like a long finger on the mammo.  And it looked like a blob, with elongated ends, some fuzzy in the middle then a black outline and a bright white line, sort in the shape of a heart.  I can't get the images out of my head.  if anyone out there can make sense of it all I would be so grateful!  TIA!
