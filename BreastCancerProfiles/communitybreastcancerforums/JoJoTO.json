I had to really bug for a referral to the palliative team but when I finally got it, it was the right thing to do. I met with two palliative docs first for more of a history and \"get to know you\" session. FYI, I worked at a high level in Stroke and Brain rehab for a long time so I am well aware and not afraid of the possible consequences that I might face in 2 months or 3 years. My experience has led me to see that just because you have a stroke or Heart attack, how you look right after is definitely not how you might look in 3-4, 6 weeks etc. I have chosen to tell my POAs to really listen to the docs on prognosis and know that I am okay with being \"let go\". But also, if the docs and rehab team say that they need more time o describe what might happen, I want that time. I have Brain mets but a very well controlled systemic cancer. My thoughts on this will be more in keeping with my good function now and knowing that I'm not going to get off Scott free from this disease. The most important thing, for me is coming up... I'm sitting with the palliative docs and discussing or rather, working through what my values are..These values will consider what deficits I will be okay to live with and will also discuss the possibility of Dying with Dignity ( euthanasia) . And then I'll have an appointment again to discuss my wishes with the docs and my POAs. I take this very seriously and when this process is complete, I'll feel more confident about being able to live more freely without putting undue stress on my loved ones. I am certain you should have access to a palliative team and if not your government probably has documents that help you work through the process. Remember, your wishes are your own and should only be influenced by your values and experiences Take good care and good luck! Jojo",
