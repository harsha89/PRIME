Some other side effects that she experienced. 1. She feels like she is walking on the moon 2. Her head feels a bit heavy (like her brain is too big for the skull) 3. Tired not as energetic as before especially as she is no longer on steroids 4. Vision is slightly blurry, however, this is improving Generally she does not quite feel like herself and it makes her a bit frustrated and she is active. I have spoken to other people who went through this ordeal and they all confirmed that they improved over time.",
