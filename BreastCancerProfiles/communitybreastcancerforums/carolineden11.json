During that exam the nurse found a lump in my breast. I always had trouble feeling the lump myself because I'm only 25 and my breasts feel lumpy everywhere but I went for an ultrasound anyway. The lump didn't show up on the ultrasound. Within the same month or so my appendix burst, I defended my M.Sc., got married, and moved to the United States so I kind of forgot about the lump since the ultrasound was negative. However, this month I noticed it again. I went to the doctor's office and my doctor said she felt lumps in both breasts. I can only feel one. It is about pea sizes, movable, smooth and feels circular. I had another ultrasound which again showed nothing. The radiologist said that it was normal breast tissue. My question is, should I leave it at that or do I need to insist on further testing (maybe a biopsy)? Should I still be worried or is it pretty likely that it's nothing? I should also mention that I don't think the lump has grown in the last 8 months.Â  Thank you for you time! Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Log in to post a reply",
