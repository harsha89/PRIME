Since it's the weekend and no doctor is in I thought I would ask here if it's normal or not? I was doing fine till this came up and like I said, it's real tender. Thanks for any advice.

Ended up finding out it may have been caused by a cyst that was just below my nipple. They removed the cyst and it was fine. No cancer. Not saying yours is the same but it should be looked at by a doctor. The lady that does all my mammograms over the years said that any change needs looked out. Good luck, keep us posted.",
