I was just wondering what kind of side effects to expect and when will they start. It seems to have raised my sugar way high (I'm a diabetic) so I don't know if I can even stay on the trial. I was trying to find anyone stage 2 who were on the same meds but no luck.",

I've been on Letrozole since May 2017 and don't have too many side effects some worsening stiffness in hands and feet. I did read the side effects for Afinitor (started Dec2017) but the only thing I seem to have is raised gulcose numbers. Was wondering if any of the side effects build up over time ie (fatigue and mouth sores are the main se) or maybe I got the placebo instead. In which case I better figure out what else could be effecting sugar levels!",
