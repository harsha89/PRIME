It was actually a nice time to just rest. I am a bit worried about how bad my skin will get. The tape they put on my skin today for the simulation made me red. I asked the RO if he would do a blood draw and check my counts because my muscle fatigue (from chemo) has gotten worse this past week. I can't believe how sore they are. It's like the soreness after an intense workout or hike. And the only thing i've done is get out of the bed in the morning! Anyway, he gave me a lab order, i had it done and my counts look ok. So I guess it's just from the chemo. Wow. Insane Evil Poison.",

I think I am also more nervous about rads than I was with chemo or surgery.  I wonder if it's because we're tender, emotionally and physically, and so very gun shy at this point. I have no idea how many rounds I am having which is sort of unusual for me because I am usually on top of things.  The RO may have told me but I didn't hear it. It may be because I am so worried.  I hope the first few weeks are as uneventful as they promise. I could use the weeks to recover mentally and be ready for the discomfort toward the end. Thanks Moderators for the links. Peace, Wendy    ",

During the intial surgery she excised me three times in the area of the intial DCIS until she got clean margins. The pathology showed more DCIS, LCIS, ADH & ALH. I sent all my records to Dr. Michael Lagios in California and he recommended I heal for a few months and then have another Mammogram and MRI.  He said based on the Van Nuys Prognostic Index my recurrence rate at a mean 12 years followup is 6.2% without irradiation therapy and 2.5% with irradiation therapy. I am very pleased with these numbers and will take his recommendations. And finally I just stepped over to join the ranks of those who view DCIS as precancer.   A friend in the field has made the comment \"It's a precancer that is treated like cancer.\"  As a cellular biologist myself (and reading a bit about what is going on in the field) I get the impression that in the future DCIS will not be treated so aggressively and the SOP for DCIS will change. I hope it is closer than it seems.",

I am more of a regular poster on the May chemo board. I had a similar thing with insurance related to chemo. The facility where I got my chemo infusions done is in-network but their pharmacy was not. This made my nuelasta shot co pay around $500. I switched to mail order CVS and copay was $35!  Insurance is crazy sh*t. Anyway, glad you like your new RO. Let us know how it goes. So far you are first up. I have my sim on 8/26.",

My surgeon inserted a sprinkler-like system under the skin that distributed a lidocaine-like drug over a period of 5 days. It was fantastic!
