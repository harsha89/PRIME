I am moving forward with a prophylactic mastectomy (mostly because of all my unknown family history) and my breast surgeon obviously doesn't think it'll be a problem to get it covered or I'm sure she would have said something. But I'm just so scared they are going to deny it. Has anyone had theirs covered with a moderate risk gene (or no gene) and limited family history? I have UHC if anyone has that.

I\u2019m trying to find a surgeon to do a prophylactic mastectomy but am finding they aren\u2019t that willing with this mutation but I see others in support groups I\u2019m in that have managed to find surgeons to do it so I know they are out there. Anyone have any recommendations in Dallas texas area? Log in to post a reply",

I\u2019m in Dallas to and I have a BARD1 mutation as well with a family history (my grandma and great-grandma) and ive seen 2 surgeons who did not want to do a prophylactic mastectomy. You mentioned you saw 2 surgeons who supported a mastectomy if you wanted it. I was wondering if you\u2019d be able to share who those surgeons were?",
