My skin reaction during radiation varied tremendously day to day, sometimes so hot and red, other times not too bad.  I am a very pink-skinned person living in a very sunny place, so my vast experience in dealing with sunburn really paid off through the first couple weeks of rads.  During the third week I started to peel and the red spots would appear for a few hours.  A very cool shower plus aloe and a fan to cool the skin, and the dots would fade.  Now I am done, but the dots are bright red, angry, itchy, and almost look like pits in the skin.  I have very large breasts, and the red stripe where the band of the bra sits under the breast is so red with small blisters and raw patches. Does anyone know what those red dots really are?  Why is it so much worse?  My RO said things would improve as soon as treatment stopped, but that is SO not my situation.  I have been using Aloe and Cetaphil cream throughout treatment and have been using vitamin E cream and recently started using radiagel.    Any help or suggestions?",

I think that there are lots of variations on the positioning, and I know that it can depend on the machine they are using for you.  I was face down but on a different board than what they used for anyone else.  the techs had never used it before.  I think that it was because my breasts are so big.  My RO described the measurement and I didn't quite follow but I think it was from sternum to the ribs on the other side across the surface--whatever it was it allowed them to go higher dose for four weeks instead of lower dose for six and still do it safely.   I know that there were other face down boards and they had most people face up, so like everything in BC--it varies from person to person.    Davida asked how much lotion, and I guess that varies too.  Our climate is so hot and humid, so my clinic Is all about Aloe and I have been using a big tub of Cetaphil cream.  It made me chuckle when Peggy said she didn't finish her one tube of goo.  I finished a bottle and four Tubes of Aloe plus 2 tubes of Radiagel plus I am most of the way through a big Costco sized tub of Cetaphil plus a tube of Cetaphil.    Plus I used some vitamin E cream.   I am going to buy some more aloe tomorrow.  ;-) Working through radiation has been tricky for me.  I teach middle schoolers, so I need to be close to 100%, or I need to not be there, so I planned a few days off along the way.   My admin appreciated that I could plan ahead and arrange a good sub, so it didn't make any hassles for them.  I took Fridays when I could, since that is the hardest day.  There is always some way to make it work.  ",
