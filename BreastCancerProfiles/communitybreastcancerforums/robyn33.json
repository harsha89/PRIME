But I try to push it to the back of my mind.  The fear seems farther and farther away every day.  I just had lat flap surgery at the end of June.  Even my radiated breast looks better than ever (my PS worked a miracle on that one).  I'm so glad I had the surgery because it lifted my spirits and makes me look whole again. Go for it--you deserve it after all you've been through!  :-)  Carpe' diem!!!!!",

I don't want them to feel isolated during this episode of their life just because I (or my husband) want to be \"private.\"  While I am the one that has been diagnosed, my family will be coping with all of the stages of treatment and recovery, also, but in a different capacity. ",
