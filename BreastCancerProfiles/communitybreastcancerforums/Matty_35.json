The ultrasound said that the cyst was clearly defined and fluid filled. The doctor told me that this was likely the cause for the indent. I told him that I couldnt accept this and he referred me to a major hospital for a rapid assessment. Apparently I will have further testing and results the following day. Will keep u posted.",

      "Content": "Matty_35 wrote: hello everyone. This is my first post although I've been lurking for a while. My name is Matty and I am a 35 year old mother of three. Back in august of this year I felt a painful lump in my lower right breast. I went for an ultrasound and a small cyst was discovered. My doctor told me no follow up needed. I became worried again two weeks ago when I noticed a small indentation in the same area. I went to my doctor who did a physical exam and could not see the dent. I think it was the light in his office because it is clearly there. Anyways he sent me for an ultrasound none the less. I am going back to see him on Wednesday but I wanted to know what you ladies think of this. Can the cyst cause the dent or is this something more? Log in to post a reply",

I have not told anyone about this as it's hard for me to be strong when people around me are worried. I just don't know what to push for. My doc said they won't do mammogram on me because of my age. If the second ultrasound shows a cyst in the area of the dent do i just accept that it is the cause of everything? Im so confused :(.",
