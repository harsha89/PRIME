I wonder if I am truly an anomaly, or if anyone else has a similar situation. I had a large tumor (2.5cm) that lay in my breast for years ( either misdiagnosed as b9, or turned cancerous). I am so sick of hearing about early detection. Money and resources need to go toward preventing, or healing recurrence/mets. Anyway, my lymph nodes were negative. I am er/pr strongly positive. Onco 17, Miotic rate of 1, scary ki-67 of 25. grade 2/3. I am thrilled with the negative nodes, but I obsess over how it could sit and not spread, when some women have a tumor for a few months that spreads. Has anyone else had a tumor for a long time?

I expected the worst, but was pleasantly surprised to be at stage 2A. Usually when I read about delaye diagnosis the outcome is terrible. I then get very anxious. I am sorry you went through bc, but appreciate your story",
