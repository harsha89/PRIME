I've had a brownish - purplish discoloration with some red on almost half of my breast. I have had a texture change on a small patch of my breast that feels scaly. My breast have started to become extremely itchy especially around the nipple. I have also been having dark brown spots pop up on my breast that were never there before (they kinda look like freckles but darker) the doctor said 1 looked like it had changed. When I went to the breast oncologist he said he could feel dimpling & thickening of the breast tissue. Also I just haven't been feeling quite like myself. Very fatigued dont feel like doing anything. Then the mammogram said it found a small nodular density in the center of my right breast! So I am freaking!! I go Tuesday for the diagnostic mammogram & back to the breast oncologist on the 19th of this month. The waiting is killing me!! I don't know how I'm gonna make it till then without going insane!!!! Help!!! Plus I have a strong family history of cancer on both sides of my family! Especially in the women!",
