Either way, I think a second opinion from somewhere else, armed with all your notes and info would be a really sensible idea, even if all it does is confirm that your current processes are working.",

I know it won't help you now Nickel, but for anyone else reading this thread please look into the use of Mepitel film. This treatment was developed by the RO who did my breast care during rads so I was in excellent hands. I had slight reddening of the skin and that was all. All women at my hospital are treated with the film, which stays on from the moment you start rads till about 7-10 days afterwards. We also use cold cloth compresses 3-4 times per day. This is the University press release: https://www.southerndhb.govt.nz/news/media-releases/breakthrough-helps-breast-cancer-patients/ This is the PubMed abstract: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24486117 This is the Honours thesis that my RO wrote on the original trial: https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10523/5458/SutherlandAnnieE2014BRT%28Hons%29.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y I am happy to answer any questions about it and if there's anything I'm not sure of, I can ask the RO directly.",

Here are two links to articles about it Mepitel film trial and Radiotherapy & Oncology Journal and if you're really interested, this is the thesis on the trial that my RT did for her Bachelors with Honours in RT Thesis . This truly has been a breakthrough in the treatment of radiation skin side effects. I wish the information would get out there and help many more women!",
