I am considered high risk for reoccurrence, therefore, my breast surgeon, oncologist and the oncologist who provided me a second opinion all highly recommended it. I was diagnosed at stage IIB with positive lymph nodes. As far as randomizing, you will be randomly selected to either receive the drug or will be randomized to not. I was happy I was randomized to receive it. The cycle is 3 weeks of the drug followed by one week off. I hope this sliver of information helps :)",
