The local anesthesia into my nipple for the dye for the SNB was the worst, but it the pain was pretty brief. My recovery from the surgery was fairly fast and uneventful. I had some pain in the recovery room-- I told the nurse and she gave me some more IV pain meds as well as vicodin by mouth. At home I took vicodin for a couple of days, and then switched to plain tylenol. I didn't like the way the vicodin made me feel, so I stopped it as soon as I could, and felt much better afterwards. A couple of days after surgery I was up and taking a walk, wearing a good firm bra so nothing moved much. A superfirm bra is something IÂ  highly recommend after a lumpectomy, especially if you are big breasted. I was kind of tired after the surgery and rested a lot for about a week.",
