I I hope the tumor flare is what yours is as well. I also hope that the pain goes away completely!",

She had a hard time getting comfortable when laying down and also a soreness if she touched the rib/liver area. She asked the nurse who said it was probably the chemo working on the liver (she has liver mets). When she went to the oncologist, she didn't seem too worried about it. She said it could be a pulled muscle. It went away after about a week. She had another round of chemo yesterday so we'll see if it happens again. She will have a scan in the next few weeks so hopefully we'll find out it was the chemo working. Are you currently on chemo?",

I'm not sure how that works since she has only gone through 3 AC treatments and will be doing Taxol after that. They told her that they would probably do a few tests but not sure what kind on Thursday as well. Guess we'll just have to wait and see. Seems like there is a lot of that these days.",

She has had one round of AC and will be doing Taxol starting the 5th cycle. My parents are meeting with the doctor on Monday to find out more about the liver. Once that happens, they will probably get a second opinion from a doctor who has more experience with TNBC. The oncologist they have right now gave them very little hope. They left the appointment wondering how long she actually had to live. :( They live in SC but are willing to travel. A few people have told them doctors to look in to. I know there is one at UNC and NY. Hopefully the first chemo kicks some cancer butt!",

I don't know where you live but maybe a new onc would give you more hope and more options. I have heard there are a lot of different combinations of chemo so maybe there is one you haven't tried. It seems like everyone on these boards get second opinions. Hope you can get some good news! My mom is currently with a local oncologist but I don't think he has a lot of experience with TNBC so they are looking into oncs with TNBC experience. We live in SC so we have heard of Dr. Lisa Carey at UNC. Also, we were given two other names-Dr. Cliff Hudis at Sloan or Dr. Linda Vahdat at Weill Cornell. Those would be a long way away for us so we're not really sure which one to go with. The onc just started her on chemo but I keep seeing that a lot of you are doing trials. Do trials start early on or later on? Do the oncs keep up with this stuff or are we supposed to look for trials? Thanks for the help!",

The breast started out 5x5cm and it got down to 1.5 x1.5cm.  It has been stable since. Her lymph nodes grew by a good bit and now they're 1.9x1.9cm.  As far as side effects, she had mouth sores after each round. She didn't really have a whole lot of hand foot syndrome but she kept lotion on a lot. After the third round, she had a bad skin reaction so they delayed and reduced the dosage. The last round was really easy for her. I guess the delay and reduced dosage worked really well for the side effects.  Hope Doxil is very effective for you! My mom is moving on to a clinical trial. I'm not sure which one but hopefully it works as well. I think one is ENMD-2076. Anyone in a clinical trial? I like the veliparib and carbo trials but I'm not sure what the oncologist will suggest.",

I think she is doing Xeloda with it. It is supposed to be synergistic. There may be other chemo that can be used with it too. Maybe this could be an option for you. ",
