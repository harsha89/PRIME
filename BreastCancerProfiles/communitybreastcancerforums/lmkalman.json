      "Content": "Jan 5, 2010 04:43PM - edited Jan 5, 2010 04:44PM by lmkalman Hey All,   I am a 44 year old woman who had some bleeding from my right breast (two small beads) and went in for a diagnostic mam in November.  Mam did not show anything so they did an ultrasound same day.  It also did not show anything but doc insisted on doing an MRI.  This was done on 12/16.  Results show biopsy suggested possible DCIS or papilloma- BIRADS 4B-intermediate.  My biopsy is scheduled for 1/11.  I am an anxious nervous nellie but also a woman of faith so I know God is in control.  I have been reading the posts for weeks and it has given me so much information.  Thanks ladies for sharing. WAITING AND not knowing is the hard part for me.  Should I be concerned about the BIRADS4B-intermediate?  Does that increase my chances of DCIS?",
