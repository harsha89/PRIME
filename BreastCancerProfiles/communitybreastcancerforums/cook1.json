I really don't even know how radiation works or how they know where to line up the machine. What do the xrays show, I always thought that xrays show like your bones and stuff. How do they know it's working? They told me that they signed me up for 35 treatments and said they they may increase it or lessen it, depending on how well I did. They didn't say anything about boosters, what are those and how do you know if your having one.  Did anyone have pictures taken ( that made me mad) 3 different times they took pictures of my chest and the surgery area when I asked, I was  told they they used them for reference, well reference for what? They told me not to worry they just stayed in my chart. Well there in a digital carmera ( that they took them with) and there on a computer so they could print the picture as well. That's more than in my chart! And they took one of my face as well.   I also get gastrointestinal destress ( I call it) after my treatment has anybody else had that?  One more thing as long as I'm venting ( I really don't have anybody to talk to about this that's gone though it)  After my surgery my tests showed that I had 2 traces of lobular cance insitu, noone seems to worry about that but me. And it does worry me. My mother had breast cancer 2 times had both breasts had to be removed. They did test me for the Brc1and2 and I don't have it But, I'm only 50 they said that I was young and that my chances of getting it back are greater because of my mother and my age and now with the lobular insitu I would think that would be bad. When I asked the oncologist, she said that I didn't need chemo  (  lymph nodes clear) and that when I start taking the Armidx that with help with the lobular cancer. Any thoughts?  The place has a Co-Ed changing room that I really,really hate! Log in to post a reply",
