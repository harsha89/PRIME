Thank God the radiologist decided to biopsy, even though most calcifications are benign. I had three surgical consults last week and finally decided on one. She says I am a good candidate for Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation (age 51 and <3 cm). I've been researching and am not sure about the APBI. I am worried because it is still fairly new, albeit since 2001. There is still data coming in, so I'm inclined to do the full radiation, even though the cancer is in my left breast. I understand with full, your heart and lungs will be protected if you lay face down. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
