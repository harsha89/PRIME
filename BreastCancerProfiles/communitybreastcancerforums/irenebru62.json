I ask because this has been a long road for me, started out in a local breast center and lests just say it was not a pleseant experience. Decided to go to a breast surgeon and he just wanted me to wait 6 months to see if the area grew larger, I opted for a biopsy. As I stated earlier I also had Breast Specific Gamma Imaging which was negative and the surgeon felt the biopsy would be negative which it was. I guess the discomfort I have is intermittent and probably would ot even notice it if I wasnt scheduled for this post mamogram. I am quite certain anxiety plays a role in all of this but curious to see if anyone has experienced any discomfort or gone on to have a different diagnosis...Thanks",

I am scheduled for my 6 month mamogram next Tuesday and a little nervous. once you get that b9 result you think wow its over and then they say, see you in 6 months, yuck. I have had some soreness in the affected breast and that concerns me. I had a stereotactic biopsy which was benign and a BSGI which was negative so you think I could just relax. My surgeon does not usually excise pash but said if it is bothering me he will. Has anyone one else had tenderness with pash.Can it grow during the 6 month wait for the follow up mamo. I certainly hope the biopsy was read correctly, had it done at a very well known breast center, I guess the worry never ends. Trying to be positive...",
