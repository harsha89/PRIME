      "Content": "melevebos wrote: I had my follow up with the surgeon today. To catch you up to speed here is what I posted before: I have had a lump in my breast for the past year. I am 31 years old and have 3 children. I was sent by family doctor to see a surgeon and he ordered a mammo and ultrasound last year. Both came back totally negative. This surprised him as he felt that the lump may be a fibroadenoma. But he said that even that would show up on U/S. The lump is still there and very distinct, about 1.5 -2 cm. Since that time I have developed an area just below that is not a \"lump\" but a hardened thickened area. About 3 cm wide. I have significant pain in that breast on a regular basis (not-cyclical) and sometimes so severe it almost puts me in tears. Can anyone help? I already have carcinoid cancer (neuro-endocrine cancer). So now that the history is out of the way, here is what happened today. Doc totally shocked me when he didn't just dismiss the changes as fibrocystic. I didn't want to be dismissed, but I guess a big part of me wanted some reassurance that the stuff I'm feeling is normal. Anyhow, he did say that it is possible that the lump is a fibroadenoma (despite the fact that it didn't show up on ultrasound last year) and that the other changes surrounding it are just irritation, reaction or inflammation in the surrounding tissue. Has anyone heard of breast tissue reacting to a fibroadenoma this way? He told me if he was confident that this was the case he would just schedule me tomorrow to remove the distinct lump and send it for biopsy, but he is not. I went into this visit wanting to walk out with an MRI order. Instead he refused and said he wants another ultrasound that maybe we just got a crappy radiologist the first time that didn't know how to read the scan. But that didn't make sense either as i had it done at an actual breast clinic and that is all these radiologists deal with, and the fact that the tech didnt' see anything there either to measure. SO... I guess I will go for the US and if it still doesn't show these distinct palpable changes, then we know somethign is wrong and this is not a fibroadenoma or cyst. If he will not order MRI or core biopsy at that point then I will seek out another surgeon, and this one will be a breast surgeon not just a general surgeon. Thank you all for the input and information you gave me to help me determine the appropriate action to take to get answers. I should find out tomorrow morning when they are scheduling the US. They said the doc wanted the first available appt and the doc promised me that he would have some answers for me within in a week and we would go from there. Melissa Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "melevebos wrote: I had mammo and ultrasound today finally. Well as suspected it was a waste of time, well sort of. The lump and thickening in the left breast still were not seen on mammo OR U/S. Ruling out cyst or fibroadenoma. However they did find a solid mass a little bigger than 1cm in the right breast (the good breast), that I just felt for the first time this week. Again with my age they said it is most likely a fibroadenoma. They said on US it is definitely not a cyst, but at first glance didn't appear to be anything malignant. I saw it when they were doing the US and it was distinct but with fuzzy edges. But I should get full report by Tuesday. They said the reason they did not put the 2 cm lymph node in the prior report was because it didn't appear cancerous because it was white on US and not black???? I don't get it. Either way it was enlarged so isn't that enough to raise an eyebrow with a corresponding breast lump, even if the lymph node is not cancerous? So now I have to wait for surgeon to get report before he will decide whether or not to order MRI. The tech also mentioned several small palpable lymph nodes around axillary region of left side. I really want to believe this is not cancer, but it's getting harder and harder with each new test or finding. I wanted to cry when I left there today because I was really hoping to have some more definite info and instead i just left with more questions. And the radiologist who was there today is the one who mis-read a prior scan. So I requested the other radiologist do the report when they come in tomorrow. I don't know how I'm going to get through more waiting. I called the surgeon and asked if he would order MRI now and they said he won't do anything until he gets the official report. How do you deal with the waiting and not knowing. I thought this past week was bad, but now, God knows how long it is going be until I have MRI and biopsy at this point. By the time I get there, I'm probably just going to tell them to cut them both off, I don't want or need them, or the hassle and worry that comes with having boobs. I know that sounds extreme, but that is my mindset at the moment. I don't know whether to scream or cry. All the ladies on this board have been very helpful, but I have to function in the real world too, not just online. Right now I'm finding that very hard to do because I am so pre-occupied with whatever is lurking in my boobs. Sorry for the rant. Just trying to maintain what little sanity I have at the moment.

      "Content": "melevebos wrote: OK, so I saw the surgeon yesterday. He refused MRI. He said he wants another US. I asked him why since the other US was negative. I thought I had mammo and US last year, but when I pulled out the films, turns out it was 2 years ago He said that since new developments and changes in my breast have happened and since the US was 2 years ago that it is possible something would show now. He also said there are good and bad radiologists and maybe we got a bad one last time. He said he can't possibly believe that he could feel what he was feeling and that it wouldn't show on US. I know there are good and bad radiologists, but totally dismissed this possibility and was disappointed and frustrated when I left that he wouldn't order MRI. So this morning I got curious and pulled out my old US and mammo films and report and looked at them. On the US films I saw one shot that had a distinct oval area with an arrow pointing to it and another shot that they drew a square around it that appeared to be the same area but through a different setting on US. Now considering that the US report was stated as completely negative with no further detials, imagine my shock when I called in today, had them pull up my films and was told that what was highlighted was an enlarged axillary lymph node (almost 2 cm) and calcifications!!! Had I known this 2 years ago, I certainly would NOT still be sitting here 2 years later with this crap in my boob. So now I'm just hoping like hell that this is not cancer that has had 2 years to grow and spread through my body. I am freaking out completely, whereas before I was more just \"concerned\". The good news is that I am going to an actual breast evaluation center. They told me that even though my doc didn't order it they will do a mammo as well since the last one was read as negative, but noted an increased density in the upper outer quadrant of left breast compared to right breast and prior mammo. They also said that the radiologist will sit down with me at that appt and discuss my results and if need be THEY can order and MRI. Also, being uninsured I qualify for the WALK program and will get my scans for free!!!! So while all of this is good news and heading in the right direction, now I have a week to sit here and totally go insane. How does everyone deal with the waiting? I keep telling myself that I am going to watch TV or play with the kids or do something to distract myself and I keep ending up back here reading to get more information. Distracting myself is not working. Sorry this post is so long, I have alot on my mind apparently. Log in to post a reply",
