Yesterday I noticed a quarter sized rash or discoloration and have also experienced some pain along with the itching. I went to my PCP today and they have me scheduled for a mammogram on Thursday (which may not be helpful if it is IBC) and an appointment scheduled with a surgeon on Oct 15. I am extremely worried after doing my own research and am going to push to get the appointment with the surgeon pushed forward so I can have a biopsy done sooner. I am a 36 year older mother of 4",

The discoloration seems more bruise like and almost the same color as my areola. I have noticed another small spot at the top of my areola. Still itchy and painful. Hoping to rule out the worst and get to treating whatever it is. Thank you for your comments. I am trying my best to avoid searching, even within this community, as it just worries me more.",
