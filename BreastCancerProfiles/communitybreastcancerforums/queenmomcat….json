And he's right. Doesn't matter whether you're waiting for that biopsy result in the beginning, or for the results of the PET scan to see if immunotherapy is working. 2) the radiologist who read that first mammogram of mine, and ordered a followup ultrasound, said \"I'm not going to tell you NOT to rush out in a panic and read everything you can find, because that's what everybody does. But keep in mind that even if you HAVE got cancer, most of what you read isn't going to apply to you.\" I've known since mammogram one that there was something of concern to oncologists in one of my breasts. And yet I still sweated miserably through the wait for my biopsy result. But don't be shy about coming here to ask questions, even if you aren't sure what your diagnosis is! I wasn't sure after lumpectomy whether I'd need to come back for a mastectomy (I didn't!) so read the mastectomy boards then asked the lovely helpful ladies on the mastectomy boards all sorts of questions, which basically boiled down to \"Why did you decide what you did? Are you happy with your decision?\"",

Demystifying what lies ahead might help too: see if you can figure out what's bothering you specifically, other than the obvious \"I have just been diagnosed with cancer.\" and ask people ahead of you \"How did you handle [insert what's worrying you most]?\" (I'm not even going to hazard a guess what that might be. I don't know what your background is, ,much less your prognosis.) That said, all this is an emotional rollercoaster--you're going to have good days and bad days even without any changes in either diagnosis or treatment.

Mine didn't. As I understood it: The initial biopsy takes a small sample of the total area of concern--the one that the radiologist finds most worrisome based on the images they have available to them. I think the 'sample' taken after the official surgery is intended to be the entire area of concern (how's that for a euphemism) so the pathologist has a far more accurate idea of what's wrong.

And I think that's pretty much what's happening. Well, that and I'm of the sardonic impression that the medical professionals with whom we're dealing tend to minimize side effects. That could be a lot of things: wanting to reassure us, not having been through the process themselves, having seen too many truly horrendous effects to be overly concerned with, say, stickiness under our armpits or not being able to shave. Fourth treatment today, and I'm starting to get prickling inside my breast. Not unbearable, but it feels kind of like a baby hedgehog turning over in its sleep rather than a full-on porcupine on the loose. And crackly neckbones and stiffness in my pectoral muscle on the side which received surgical intervention.from lying on my back with my arms over my head and my head turned to the side. But I expected that! I'd already noticed twinges in my left arm after the surgery, especially after swimming/doing the Nautilus circuit. Three-day weekend for me.

I'll add you to the list, and update with a start day when you settle that with your RO. NM: don't worry, you did just fine for your first post. I'm not sure there's really a wrong way to post, save perhaps for using inflammatory language. Now for your actual question. I can't imagine that mixing creams/lotions/ointments is a problem--my RO has me using something called AVO cream topical emulsion\" right after rads, as it's absorbed quickly (faster than plain-vanilla drugstore moisturizer) so I don't feel like I'm sliding out of my bra on the way home, and Aquaphor morning and night. But I think that Aquaphor is as much a barrier as a moisturizer, so using that after the Miaderm makes sense. I don't know how much 'redhead skin' matters--i'm only a few shades darker than my \"Cullen clan\" husband--but Kbeee mentioned an \"early days\" reaction. Skysquirrel and I both pinkened up within forty-eight hours, but I settled down for the rest of that week. (Sky: did you have a period of calm, or did you stay pink?) Keep us posted on that though. It's no joke or stock line that we all do react differently.",

Thank you for mentioning it, for anyone coming up behind who may be in the prone position. And fans are a good idea. (squinting to envision the table and equipment) Not much space under the table for airflow around your face, I imagine, between the table hoist and the mechanism for the irradiation head and imaging equipment. Georgie: that does make sense about finishing the fills before starting radiation. I gathered from my RO that there's a window of several weeks in which we may start rads, so needing an extra week or five to finish fills isn't a cause for panic. Kbee: baby oil (shudders) I'm never going to look at Aquaphor in the same way again. I've surreptitiously been snipping arms off my aloe plant--no skin breaks yet. My general note du jour: I've noticed that I've feeling hot and sweaty generally after my rads, not just on the treated area. It's a bit warm, for mid-September in Michigan, but not enough to leave me feeling this sticky. Otherwise I'm doing well enough, except for that square of \"baby oil\" patch. i'm a bit red and abraded in a couple of spots, but I think that's my bra rubbing--one where the strap buts against my shoulder when I reach across and another where the side seam of my bra cup ends.",

Now you've got me contemplating vegetables. Roasting a chicken on a bed of root vegetables got my husband into eating veggies too, and even made a hit with my sister's kids (11 and 10) The chicken juices and whatever you've rubbed on it drip down and flavor the vegetables underneath. But that's a trifle starchy, for them as are concerned about such things. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of swiss chard flavored with balsamic vinegar, another fall-ish dish for anyone looking for greens. Anything else floating around out there in cyberland? especially since it sounds like rads can have an effect on our appetite, even if we're not technically having any appetite centers zapped.",

I've been working out, but that's pretty much all I've managed to do other than go to rads and pet the cats in a desultory way....and that only because they insert themselves under my hands when they feel the need for attention. Dishes pile up on the counter, laundry remains not only unfolded but wilting in the drier, flowerbeds unweeded. This week, my husband has been strictly abjured to not even bother asking me what I want for dinner, but just put food in front of me. Not so much nausea for me--I'm in the supine position--but an extreme disinterest in food/loss of appetite. Maybe stress for me, but as someone with mild GERD, I can well imagine that just the pressure of lying on your stomach on a hard surface would trigger reflux, and with it nausea. But my skin's doing well enough, with only a couple of sore spots where my bra rubs. No skin breaks, though. At my exit interview yesterday, the nurse mentioned that fatigue may continue for \"ten days to two weeks\" before starting to abate, as I didn't have chemo.",

My two cents on the metal-free deodorant is \"Check with your facility, and be very specific in how you phrase the question.\" I asked something to the effect of \"Am I to NOT wear deodorant which includes metal at any point during the month of September, or only during the actual treatment, as with mammograms?\" The staff at my facility made clear that I could wear whatever I wanted during treatment....as long as it didn't have metals in it. My RO's general take was \"as long as you haven't got skin breaks, you're good to go\". But I gather he was unusual. And, I suspect, so was I: I swam for three of the four weeks )the Y was closed for renovations during the first week of my rads), used alcohol-based gel antiperspirant when not actually on the table, wore my regular bras...and ended up with only two reddened areas, about six square inches total.",

Edit: just to put this in perspective, I swam in a chlorinated public pool throughout rads, and didn't have a problem with skin irritation over and above the usual chit resulting from the rads themselves--pinkness and heat, but no skin breaks.

That lotion's going in my \"rads\" bag, along with the Antiperspirant Whose Name Must Not Be Spoken to apply after the treatment's over.

Unless the machine breaks down, but even then they let you get up and stretch while they fix the thing. And i can barely find the tattoos either. What to tell co-workers if they ask why you've been off so long? \"I've had medical issues. How's the season gone?\" is my best guess as to a neutral response that will probably divert the conversation to something less fraught, though i confess I like the idea of being abducted by alien penguins.",

Just enough to bother me. Discombobulatingly, I've noticed lumps in my treated breast over the past few days, but I think it's just a combination of surgical scars and tissue reaction to radiation. The RO commented on the pinkening in my armpit so I checked in the mirror this evening: apparently my field is a bit larger than I'd thought! Alas. So the upper edge--armpit to sternum--is considerably pinker than my breast itself. Not quite as pink as where my bra band runs, not surprisingly, but I'll have to put on more smutz at night, and more of the InvisiLotion after treatments.",

It may be worth asking your dentist/RO if you were planning something involved (implants, root canal, crown) before you've fully recovered from rads, but given all the other things we have to worry about right now....this isn't one of them. (This came up for me because I was scheduled for a routine cleaning during my Month 'O' Rads, but since no dental X-rays over there or rads above my clavicle over here involved, neither faction was worried) SweetMamaJ: rads fields really are that much more focused (I hope!)--my techs weren't fussed about my watch (serious metal twist-o-flex band), my glasses (metal frames) or my wedding band (metal...duh). But I'm still seriously into holding my breath when I'm getting zapped.",

I have had a mild one, though I'm not ure if it's a direct effect of the rads or a byblow--my immune system on overdrive because it recognizes a threat. (nothing compared to chemotherapy or immunotherapy. A more nebulous one.) SweetmamaJ: a VW diesel? oof.

If your oncologists haven't mentioned it, or if you're not having problems doing whatever you're doing now, then don't worry about it. Really. The length of treatment is a prime example--the standard length in the U.S. has been at the upper end of the range you see here but there's a Canadian protocol (approximately the same amount of grays, divided over a smaller number of zaps) which is finally catching on here. Which deodorant or ointment is another: nothing which interferes with radiation treatment (so no metal in the whatever you apply to your pits) and minimize irritants (so nothing in an alcohol gel base). As for Aquaphor, it may be the gold standard for ointments....but you're right. It's gooey as bleep. Ask your RO if there's something less sticky. TinyDancer: let's start with \"Take a deep breath. You'll get through this.\" When in doubt, ask your oncologist, but don't plotz about possible problems until they develop. And I've added you to the list.",

Molly: my sympathies about the field that includes your neck--did the RO say anything about getting dental work out of the way first? (My dentist expressed concern about my treatment, but my field stopped a hands breadth from my clavicle.) Djmclelland: got you down for a tentative start date of Sunday (not surprised about different schedules in different countries--large Seventh Day Adventist population around where I live, and the affiliated university shuts down on Saturday.) Steflove/Kbee: good luck with your marathons! I'll be cheering at the finish line for both of you.",

It's not so much that we have different definitions for the terms, but rather that the threshold of intensity at which we start using fatigue or irritation is significantly lower than that at which the oncologists begin. For example: Fatigue, for me, did start becoming noticeable by week 2, but I think my RO used the term for what I'd consider poleaxed. Nausea? not uncommon.

I was reminded by someone starting an 'August rads' thread that there may be others out there undergoing radiation this fall, and thought to start a thread for that/us/anyone who's interested. My sim/official intake's on August 26th, and I'll start rads on August 31st. At the moment, my RO and I are planning on the Canadian protocol for me--approximately the same amount of grays but over a smaller number of treatments--but I'd like to throw this open for anyone who is or might be undergoing radiation treatment this fall, or just faced with the possibility in the near future.

(Seeing the plastic surgeon in a couple of weeks. Gonna sit firmly on his head about reducing the OTHER side, if only to make bra shopping easier.) Capippy: hoping others will chime in as well, but I (admittedly on the 'got off easy' end of the spectrum) did just the Aquaphor regime, in a somewhat desultory fashion, prior to rads. A handful of us did feel an initial uptick in SEs in the first 2-3 days, but the fatigue didn't land until week three for me. I'd suggest doing something nice/engrossing for yourself this weekend.though a wide range of things that could be--anything from a massage or facial to setting in (spring) bulbs in your garden to 'borrowing' grandchildren for the weekend to re-seating a toilet.",

Or rather, WAS! Mine were at the end--I think that's common but not an absolute given. Just ask your RO, if the thought occurs to you.",

I'd hesitate to give specific advice, even having been a list doyenne. So much of this does come down to \"It depends on how YOU react.\" Crazymaking, isn't it? What I wish I'd been told ahead of time: be clear but concise with your RO about what your concerns are that HE/SHE can address. The staff may not have the time to discuss, say, the finer points of sports bras vs. camisole tops. but if there's something important to you, mention it! (In my case, it was swimming at the Y--chlorine's a common irritant, and many ROs fuss about it. Mine said simply \"You're good to go unless you get skin breaks. Then we'll renegotiate.\" (I didn't.)) What I didn't know: chemo is physically much more difficult, but rads is psychologically stressful. (I didn't have chemo.) You have to go in every single day, and lie alone on that cold table. But that said, we will get through this. And the lovely board participants will be here for you, with support, and food porn and tissues. Lists of what to get and when are a grand idea....but we don't have to rush out to buy everything ahead of time. (How convenient is a big-box store to you? Do you have the time to run out to Target/Walmart when/if you do find you need scooshy bras?) ",

In the Fall Rads list, Keys-Plez made a video of how the machine twisted about during a treatment; that helped others on the list, IIRC. 2) Avoid alcohol in products, definitely, and make a point of reading ingredient lists since the stuff is used in the most surprising places. But don't plotz if you see 'alcohol' in something that's been recommended by your oncologists or on these boards (e.g. Aquaphor has 'lanolin alcohol' on its ingredient list). Checked with chemist F-I-L, who said that the irritant alcohol we're supposed to avoid is ONE of a much larger group of chemicals/ingredients which chemists refer to as alcohols. That said, the lanolin itself can be a potential allergen!",

I predict a very sleepy and queasy weekend for me; I'd noticed the fatigue starting last week, and not terribly surprised: I'd assumed that oncologists tend to downplay symptoms as they tend not to see the need for treating side effects before they reach the clinical stage (unable to get out of bed for 24 hours? honestly!) Flu shots tend to make me feel slightly under the weather; I get them every year anyway, even those couple of years when the U.S. supply got borked, because my husband's got asthma; our PCP doesn't want HIM getting the flu because he gets horrid bronchitis and occasionally pneumonia, and doesn't want ME getting it because I'll just run straight home and share germs with HIM. I just happened to be in today for a med check as the shipment arrived. Also pestering my techs with questions: what's that paddle? what's that octagonal cylinder? why has it got a glass plate like the lamprey head? why did you have me hold my breath longer today than yesterday? (Answers: a) that's the X-ray beam and the [some term I didn't quite catch] plate--basically it's the background/backstop for the X-ray b) because today we were piggy-backing images on the radiation zap. We're going to be doing it tomorrow too, so don't plotz.) I did warn them about being on the breast cancer boards, and wanting to answer questions others might have, in addition to my own.",

I'm more than a little vague on the details of chemo--all I know for sure is that I didn't need it because a) my cancer hadn't spread and b) mine was hormone-positive, so tamoxifen would affect whatever remained after radiation. But there are other factors, IIRC: how old is the woman? how aggressive is her cancer? any other health issues that might preclude systemic treatment? and so on.",

In regards the relative SEs of short-form rads (hypofractionated?) vs. long-form rads, IDK. Those of us with the short form may tend to get off easy, if only because our skin isn't shocked for so long. In my case, I was more than slightly cheezed off by my aftercare sheet from Dr. RO's office, which says that side effects of radiation will continue for 7-10 days, but fatigue may continue for several weeks, up to three months after treatment. Bleeping Pete! To quote Marge Piercy from Woman on the Edge of Time, from a discussion of psychiatric medications of (perforce, given the book's publication date) the 1970s: \"....Like when I take Thorazine, the effects are controlling me, making me half dead. But I get lots of side effects, trust me...like sore throat, and constipation, dizziness and funny speech.\" \"But Connie blossom, all are effects! Your drug companies labeled as side effects things they didn't want as selling points. It's a funny way of looking at things, like a horse in blinkers.\"",

Not for me (this time around) but for anyone who's wondering about rads after chemo this time. I'd just chalk it up to the perplexing variants in ROs' treatment criteria. My take on swimming (and gyms) is \"Chances are good that I have microscopic skin breaks for a significant percentage of the times I go to the Y.\" Gardening does that to you. GirlonFire: congratulations! Sewbutton: my sympathies! I too lost my temper with my husband--asked him to cut a 'sprig' of aloe and he asked in a panic if I'd been burned--so I can well understand getting up in his face about stuffing various parts of your husband's anatomy into the microwave.",

(I don't know--I'm self-employed so don't have a 'normal' work schedule, but I've returned to a normal workout schedule. Does that help?) Would you like to see the local lymphedema clinic? (Yes--I don't expect there to be a problem given the minimal intervention so far, in the spectrum of breast cancer treatment, but I'd like to make sure there ISN\"T a problem. For which see normal workout schedule.)",

This is not to say that treatment is a doddle in the park. But now, when you know you've got cancer but not what (exact) stage or what the oncologists propose to do about it, is a pervasive nightmare. Online research: there are a number of valuable web sites, such as Mayo, or Johns Hopkins, or Sloan Kettering, or MD Anderson or Medline or the NIH. But don't get sucked into the morass that's out there. You have time, as Lisa said. Time to find out more about what your treatment options are. Time to deal with the psychological shock. How fast did it grow? We don't know....but did your previous mammograms mention anything about calcifications? atypical ductal hyperplasia? Those can be precursors to DCIS. But, and this is important, you have time. Have you had a biopsy? Chances are still pretty good that it's DCIS, as etnasgirl says. (I hesitate to say \"just\" DCIS.) The surgeon and pathology lab may (and I repeat may) find a small invasive component. But, as etnasgirl mentions, that's still easily dealt with. Trust her. Do you have somebody with you now? family member or spouse or friend? Is there someone you can take with you to your appointments? (The hospital will require this if you need surgery with general anesthesia.) But for the moment: someone to talk to and to hug and to arrange frivolous distractions until you get a treatment plan in place. Please do come back and let us know what comes of all this! ",

      "Content": "Jan 18, 2016 01:41PM - edited Jan 18, 2016 01:47PM by queenmomcat The doctor (M.D.) who's reading the ultrasound results may (and I repeat may) order more tests, such as a biopsy, if they see something which doesn't resolve well on ultrasound. (Not everything does, but it's a quick test, and among the least harmful; that's why it's so often used during pregnancy to check the baby) Don't panic (much) if they do ask for something more after the ultrasound; it may mean simply that they couldn't tell what it was. (edited for clarity: the clinic physician ordering more tests is not reason to panic. The tests work differently, and so therefore produce different results. ....but that's what we do anyway.) IIRC, the ultrasound technician only does the test, but does not interpret it--that's for the M.D. to decide. They almost certainly will not tell you the results, but forward them to your primary care physician.",
