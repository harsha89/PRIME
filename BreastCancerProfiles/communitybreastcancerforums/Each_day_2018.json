      "Content": "Each_day_2018 wrote: I finished 4 AC and 12 Taxol almost 3 weeks ago. My family and I (3 kids and Husband) went camping this past weekend and on Sunday morning, I decided to drive to the restroom which was about half a mile away. I only made it to the vehicle. About an hour later my husband, who had been cooking, realized I never came back to the cabin. He came to the vehicle where I was passed out. When he woke me up, I didn't know where I was or what I was doing. It took me nearly 15 minutes to figure out that we were still camping and still at the campground. I must have clenched my jaw/bit down really hard because even today, my jaw is still tender, one of my front teeth is really sore, and I bit the entire length of the right side of my tongue, enough to draw quite a bit of blood (I woke up with blood on my shirt). We think I may have had a seizure. I had a headache through yesterday, but today I feel fine. We did have a few drinks the night before (I had about 2-3 glasses of wine and we were in bed by 11pm), but I had woken up around 5am to use the restroom and felt fine, and I woke up again around 7:30am when the kids got up and felt fine. I was up and moving around for at least a 1/2 hour before all this happened. We were leaving that day, so I had started cleaning and packing up. I didn't feel hungover or ill at all before this happened. Then afterwards, I vomited and was very dizzy for much of the day. I plan to mention this to my doctor when I go again, but was curious if anyone else has experienced something similar after finishing treatment?

I am currently halfway done with my 4 treatments of AC and I don't know if I can do anymore. I am supposed to do 12 weekly taxol treatments after the AC which I am willing to give a shot. But my side effects with the AC have been absolutely brutal.
