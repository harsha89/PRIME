    "Content": "rahimaw wrote: Dear Sisters, I have just been diagnosed with TNBC mets (brain lining, lungs, spine, pelvis, ribs, liver).  My research has so far revealed that life can be lengthened with chemo (though not a cure).  I had a horrible experience with chemo the first time around (original diagnosis, 26 months ago, Stage 3, A with 4 lymph nodes).  At that point, I did everything the mainstream docs wanted me to (surgery, lumpectomy, chemo, radiation). If there is even ONE person out there who has survived a few years with TNBC mets and has not had chemo to do so, I would love to hear about her.  (My doctor says I have one month to one year). I am considering doing lots of alternative therapies (raw foods, H2O2, Budwig-Cellect diet, etc.) and wondering if its worth it.  Could some of these at least lengthen my life a bit?
