I am not aware of that type of use but I do know how the herbal balm (not burn cream) worked for my mom. She as about 82 when she had to have a large spot on her forehead removed right down to the scull due to skin cancer. The wound was approxamently 4\" wide x 2 1/2\" high. This left her scull exposed with raw edges to heal. They told use it would probably never regrow tissue and we'd have to keep treated with ointment and covered. About a month in the hospice helper came in with this ointment and we confirmed we could use it. I don't remember how long it took but the wound completely filled back in with new tissue growth and left a light scare from where this was. The Doctor was in amazement and could not believe how well it healed. He wanted to take pictures and know what we did. So that's my story. I would use this on any type of skin injury",
