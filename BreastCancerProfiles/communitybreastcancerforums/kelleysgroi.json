I found it to be exhausting the first week as I had been out for 3 months.  I finish chemo next week and I think working has helped pass some of the time which is the only reason I went back.  Some days it is difficult to get out of bed..chemo sucks!",

I do not want to go through this again!  It has been 7 weeks since my surgery and although it has not been a bed of roses i do not regret my decision to have the surgery. i have spoken to  women who have chosen lumpectomy and have been perfectly content with that choice and some women who regret not chosing mastectomy.  You will need to dig down deep to find the best choice for yourself..no matter what you choose..my thoughts and prayers are with you.
