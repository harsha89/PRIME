It took the radiologist (my hero) to give me an all clear, the doc was just 'cancer doesn't cause pain...' sort of person. One thing I have noticed is that carbs, meat, sugar and fat stem inflammation in my body and particularly in my left side (breast) and right side (tummy).

Meanwhile, doc has given me diurectics and swelling has disappeared but pain is still there. One step at a time, it's been going on for a week, so let's see. Worried but I'm a fighter.

If you want to be sure, contact the London Breast Institute, London, ask for professor Mokbel, he definitely knows what IBC is, although I agree with Kicks, there can  be many possibilities. It's private, you'll end up paying about 500 pounds but they will do the biopsy too (another 500 pounds). THinking I had IBC drove me to the point of sheer madness, it ruined my health for 18 months, I lost 20 kilos, had multiple headaches (which I convinced myself were brain mets!) and drove myself MAD.  Health anxiety can ruin your life and in fact I think anxiety can do more damage than the cancer itself. So from one person suffering from health anxiety to another, be very careful not to convince yourself you have IBC before getting an answer. Dermatologist sounds like a good idea! Take care, Alicki   PS: Kicks if you are reading this, the headaches went away, thanks for your support, I really appreciated it.",

In the middle of that, i had white spots lighting up in my brain with terrible headaches and lost 20 kilos. Without a clear diagnosis for 17 months, my anxiety was continually focusing on my breast and fear of metastasis So despite what any body can say, i have Felt really insecure. I wansnt before. I am praying that the docs are right and Nothing got missed. 17 months of left handing does quite a lot of damage Even to the strong est person. Wren and kicks; thanks for ur kind words. I know that i need to get my anxiety sorted out. I guess my strength and confidence will grow back as the days go by I hope you understand and sincerely thank to you both incredibly strong women. Kicks: PSTD is what the docs are calling my situation. It has taken 17 months to get a good team and a particular doc who trusts women's instincts Three years ago I had a hysterectomy that took 2 years to find root cause (internal endometriosis) and never did I go through such anguish. The care was great from the start. It goes to show what happens when the care is not so good. Someone said to me that its easy to get scans here, yes it is but it's more difficult to get competent breast surgeons because we only have ob/gyn and few breast surgeons in the French speaking part of Switzerland . Hope this clarifies that standard of care can be very different from one country to another Alicki",

Knowing your breasts and advocating for yourself until you get the answers you deserve I know ladies who have gone the mascetomy route with ALH /ADH on these boards but as I don't have the condition, at least I hope, I can't comment. I have made up my find that if they did find any ADH in the future or ALH or DCIS or anything nastier, I would go the mascetomy route but that's just me. At the moment, I feel that Mx would be an overkill. Best to you, Alicki",

Monday and Thursday.  So found out that dermatologist from hospital was trained in the US in Boston and might explain why he's so open to patient communication and care. He's identified one suspicious area to biopsy and has agreed to biopsy two others I find suspicious. So scheduled for Thursday morning. After that, he will refuse to biopsy anything else UNLESS HE finds it suspicious. The slides (biopsies) will be analysed in Switzerland and I am making arrangements to send them to the US (MD Anderson, IBC center there) for a second reading. Dermatologist told me they do that quite often and I noticed MD Anderson offer this service. I know, I'm a bit of a maniac. Or I might send them to London, depending what works.  I'm glad I didn't get the biopsies done in England weirdly because of the cost and also because I can get bigger biopsies than punch ones in Switzerland.  My lymph nodes went back up yesterday after inflammation. I could feel the lymphatic system all over being inflammed, even on the right breast.  We have weird things going on. Maybe our immune systems are crashing? The rash thing is weird and it's probably thick because of the swelling. I would think if it it were IBC, it would have progressed more.  My main concern is thickening skin under areola and a slightly enlarged breast which wasn't there before. Top notch thinks it's the consequence of the mastis episode I had back in July and August. Thinking of you too.  Take care,  Alicki",

Quick question: have you been checked for lymphoma or for immune conditions? Is there a way you could get checked for that too in November?

Any good doc will make the move to refer you very fast. You have a cough, rash, lymph nodes up, drenching, any fever?. I could be wrong, I am not saying you have lymphoma, I would never say that, I am saying that you might wish to get it checked out. It could also be an immune condition too.. Again, I am not a doc, but yes, a blood test can easily miss an infection. I would nt wait for the dermatologist because there's more here than a rash by the sounds of it. Again, I'm not a doc, but here in Switzerland, they would get you in within two days. So, I know it's hard, but go the ER room and explain what is going on and insist on a referral.

I had tremendous pain for five weeks and a little redness but that went away. The edema has gone too dramatically but the skin feels to me a little more like chicken skin but its soft. There are little pin holes but I have a few on the other breast. I ve had a lot of testing and follow up and aside inflammation in first biopsy (no lymphatic invasion), the rest came back clear. And I also had three MRIs but no needle or core biopsy (they wouldn't do it) because no redness nor anything lighting up on MRI. The 2nd radiologist went to the extent of getting his boss to sign the report saying 'we hereby confirm that there is no evidence of IBC and tgerefore totally exclude it'. Not sure they would do that your side of the pond!!! (I'm in Switzerland) I'm monitoired every month. Only fatty lymph nodes (confirmed by three vg radiologists)and apparently getting better, no lymph nodes lit up never on MRIs, so I don't see what I can do more but pray that this isn't IBC . I think 2 incisional skin biopsies and 2 other punch have probably upset my breast quite a bit !!! And it needs time to get back to normal. Meanwhile, have lost 14 kilos Regarding the lymphatic drainage, I was told today that I don't have odema but my lymphatic channels are a little clogged. I went to the hospital (sessions paid by insurance) but the lady there really hurt me. So I went back immediately to another therapist who in just 30 min made me feel tremendously better. I have to pay for these sessions but so what. Health is priceless. I could ask her to teach me, she's taught me one it two things but she has a real gift for LE and I'm clumsy so I would never get the same effect. Thanks for your support and finding us again!!

Otherwise, the swelling is really down, the biopsy area is healing nicely and yesterday I went to see a Western doc versed in knowing how to balance energies (chinese medicine). She said she doesn't think there's anything there but pointed out correctly that my weak points are all gynecological which is right!. She balanced me out a bit and told me never to tell a part of my body that it can get lost (I had told my left breast that I was going to ignore it since I  had a false alert in June), because that's when the trouble starts! I don't seem to have any particular redness anymore, not more than the other side, but then I have always had reddish breasts, the oncologist asked me if I shaved my breast, der, no!  As for the waiting, I have stocked up on sleeping pills and am determined to sleep through the whole weekend. I won't do anything crazy but will sleep. Yes, I could phone to get the results, but I don't see the oncologist until next Tuesday after the Monday appointment, so if I find out something bad this wkd, I will really freak out, I therefore prefer the sleeping option.  I have managed more or less up to now this week, but the last days are going to be the hardest. Moreover, I have freaked out one of my employers, which had the stitches not bled in the middle of an important meeting, I wouldn't have done.  The last days are the hardest....

Will give the report to my dermatologist on 17 and then on 23rd, its England for me to see specialist. I will ask for other biopsies on 17 to have comparative. Blood tests are negative for auto immune which is freaking me about because that a limiting options. Biopsy results in the UK are 48h on private system.

My left breast is watery, much more than usual so it's even bigger. The sed rate was back down but I had taken inflammatories the night before. I have more results coming in tomorrow. Let's see what the MRI says. One thing is nearly sure, is that I do think I had a weird episode of mastitis in July (because the pain completely stopped and the redness went away and the biopsy results showed inflammation, which would have not been the case for cancer). What I can't make out is the lymph nodes, the left breast more watery. The inflammation seems to trigger swelling in both breasts but stays more watery in left. I have decided to ask for PET/CT scan. How easy or difficult is it to get a referral in UK for that? Here it's virtually impossible. Anyways. I have some results coming in tomorrow, I'll let you know. Best, Alicki",

Lots of fat lymph nodes have appeared and as I said, radiologists say they are ok. I'm now wondering how LONG the pinholes have been there. Nothing is showing up in the blood tests.

The results are weird.  There are NO cancer cells (IBC or other) in the huge chunk of biopsy they took, but there are too  many  lymphocytes which could indicate an infection, inflammation or God knows what. Docs are running more tests, especially that I have a tendency to 'inflame' in other parts of the body. Apparently the head of pathologist is going to check this out and there's a battle on experts on this case. Auto-immune illness has been mentioned, and even lymphoma (but I was throughly checked for lymphoma earlier this year with negative results). In short, they don't know either but are prepared to fully investigate. I want a mammo, echo and MRI to be done again- I'm not ruling IBC completely out, but the fact that the pain has completely gone, the redness is down and I am not feeling the inflammation gives me some hope.  I have been asked to enjoy my weekend, and we'll keep looking at this next week, (who knows, I might even become a case for a medical publication). Had the biopsy come back completely negative, i would have been concerned. But now they know something is going on, but they have no idea what, apart from it doesn't seem to be BC or IBC.  Let's keep going...

I can't believe (I can in fact), they will leave you like that. So sorry about your aunt. At least its caught early. Had 3 MRI, which showed nothing except skin thickening where the biopsies were done and inflammation on biopsy sites. I can see that without MRIs. Doing biopsies is really not good. Because it impairs the MRIs but they didn't see anything intra mammary nor enlarged lymph nodes in the breast. The US showed that fatty lymph nodes are there and have grown Here they are not worried about them, they say as long as they are fatty, they are not cancerous but you know me by now, I want a second opinion on this and am off to the UK again tomorrow. My left breast is still bigger and feels watery. Aside testing the lymph nodes, I really can't see what they can do. We can't biopsy anymore the breast, MRIs are clear but Something is still going on. Hopefully its begnin but nonetheless I still want to know what's up. MD Anderson wrote back saying on the Basis on the reports I gave them, there s evidence that there s no malignancy but have offered (against a fee of course) to check my biopsy materials but getting them sent them will be impossible (due to my hospital). I think I will see what top notch says tomorrow and then take it from there I have been really careful and cautious. I hope you re ok. I would suggest you go and see a doc before the end of nov but up to you :-) Right. I am going to relax before going to bed. Tomorrow I fly to England :-) Take care Alicki",

THe Top notch really didn't have a lot of time and didn't examine me properly , is just persuaded that there's nothing, that is to say mastitis with lymphengitis episode (and given that I have no pain or redness anymore, he could be well right). He's great but victim of having too many patients. I spent 10 min with him and paid 200 Pounds. Too much even by Swiss standards. So, I think he was good for the initial diagnosis (then he examined me) but after that,it was all rush rush rush. Not going back, still on the hunt for a good and caring Swiss breast surgeon... The radiologist on the other hand was 1000 times more helpful, he explained that the size of lymph nodes isn't important, big ones can be innocent, small ones deadly sometimes. It's all about the cortex of the lymph node and checking that it's ok. If something is wrong with the cortex, then they biospy it immediately. THis radiologist writes the European guidelines for breast care, so I think he does know what he is talking about. I have now had three top Breast surgeons and radiologists tell me that my lymph nodes are ok, the one in Switzerland who authorised the MRI said that sometimes, they do take a while to go back down after an inflammatory process. And to stop touching them!!!!! Regarding the breast, he says that sometimes it doesn't go back to normality (because some lymphatic channels are blocked) and now that the checks have been done, he can say that sometimes, one breast does grow bigger than the other, it's apparently a genetic thing (need to ask my mum about that----). The nurse that was there says yes there is a difference but was slight. I have three sessions of lymphatic draining next week and I will take it from there. MRI report does not indicate any diffuse thickening, only at points of biopsy which is normal. Where to go from here? A lot of testing has been done. The next check-up îs 20th November (Clinical with a doctor that missed the mastits and want to see me and learn about what happended so he doesn't miss another patient) and then one again on 30th December (with US) and again with the breast surgeon I find competent but a little direct (14th January). Even if we were to biopsy, we would not know WHERE! So I think I just have to monitor very carefully and in parallel do my sed rate blood test very two weeks or once a month because if that goes up (it's a good health indicator for me but not for everyone), then I know I'm in trouble. It's been 17 weeks now, and you I know much longer. Anyways, how are you doing, have you gone to the ER? What's your aunt's name? I will pray for her. take care, Alicki PS: Found out that drinking lots of water stops inflammation in my body. My lymphatic drainage therapist told me to do this and worked and my doc suggested I add Bach flower remeddies to this and it seems to be working. I am calmer and more focused. http://www.bachflower.com/",

So went back to the private clinic and met with a radiologist (mine was out of town), who re-read them for me and explained how they should be read. I still have one question, a tiny area that doesn't seem to correspond to what I have on my breast, but maybe I'm splitting hairs. My radiologist is a great one and they have some experience in IBC. It's been 17 weeks now and despite all the testing, I just can't kick the feeling that something is wrong. Anyways, let's see how next week plays out. If I hear Kicks correctly, a diagnosis at 17 weeks is a death sentence, so I really hope it's not that... Sorry, I'm sad this evening.",

The specialist is charging me 750 pounds for consultation and biopsy (I might ask him to take several areas just to be sure hoping that it won't cost much more). Expensive? yes, but the results are in within 48- hours or a bit more and I am fed up with all this waiting. Sometimes you just have to pay for peace of mind. OB/GYN won't do biopsy because he fears that it might create an infection, but did give me a super powerful anesthetic gel to stop the pain (treating the symptomes but not the cause....). Anyways, now I can look forward to the 20th August in less pain. As a friend of mine says, it's a good temporary measure.... I'm surprised that you have to wait so long for the results. Let me check this specialist out and if he's really that good, (sounds good), then I'll recommend him to you if you still wish to get a punch biopsy done. One step at a time...do keep in touch, it's nice to have someone to talk to about this sort of thing Best, Alicki",

I have asked if the specialist can take several biopsies and am waiting for a reply. It will cost me but I need to know. This is driving me crazy and insane. Weekends are worst because I'm on my own and don't feel like having anyone around me. My daughter is 21 and has left home. I'm trying to conceal the truth from her and because I don't see her every day, so far so good. She knows that MRI came back clear but doesn't know I'm really concerned about swelling under areola and the pain. The skin pitting is there too but that's just the result of the swelling. The US shows skin thickening but I don't need a US to show that, I can see it myself! There s no peau d orange in the clinical meaning, that is to say hard skin just thick due to the edema. I am going to another Swiss clinic on Monday and will make my case again. It would be great if the biopsies could be done here without needing to travel nor spend so much money. But If they don't do it, I will be clear that I will come back to get the English stitches taken out!!!! Talk about advocating for your health! Would you happen to know who is the IBC specialist in the UK? Hold on there and we ll get our results! I will let you know about the specialist I'm meeting with. Lets say in touch! Alicki",

I found out that I can get blood tests done in France just across the boarder and they send the results within 24h on line with password. Unfortunately, they won't do biopsies!! If I stand in the middle I can say that I had extreme pain for 5 weeks which went away, then the swelling went down (apart from inflammation episodes). One breast is 1cm bigger than the other but only if I stand up. 2 negative MRIs and the radiologists writing on paper that I don't have IBC! But the biopsy, even if checked by 4 pathologists, still doesn't explain what sort of inflammation I had and my lymph nodes are up and skin on left breast is funny. Blood count is normal and so is sedimentation rate which usually flares. So this is a mystery. A friend of mine thinks I have a problem with my lymphatic system but before I go there, lets get IBC investigated. No lymph nodes in breast have lit up. Skin thickening hasn't moved in a month, its still 0.25. MYSTERY! I will ask for 2 biopsies and ultrasound. I ll bring a box of Swiss chocolates with me :-) this is going to cost me loads but never mind health comes first. My Swiss dermatologist exasperated with my idea of going to GB was going to give in to give me another biopsy but I said to hold off until 30.06. In case an additional one is needed My poor breast. It's been 10 weeks, whatever it is it isn't growing fast, and the pain is GONE which makes me wonder about IBC because pain just would not go away.

I have booked an appointment with a Rhumi (thanks Bon for this advice) for the end of the month. As for trying to say 'my left breast is BIGGER now'; I got the normal answer that no woman is symmetrical. GRRRRRHHH! He did give in to my insistence (while the Breast surgeon had refused) for a 3 MRI to check everything is ok (different MRI doc this time!!!). And on this occasion, I'll ask the person to check lymph nodes. So scheduled for 4th November (to leave some time for the infection to heal). 5th November London if necessary and am still waiting for MD Anderson to get back to me. But I might be taking this a little too far. If only my breast could get back to its 'normal' size! My question is 'where do you stop'?, when do you decide to take it easy and relax? The last time something like this happened to me, I took out my uterus, so you can imagine that I am thinking of reducing my E cup breasts to A cup!!!! But I guess they will never let me!! Let me know how you are getting on! One thing is for sure, no more biopsing!!! As for a PET/SCAN, might ask for that if I go to London and Anderson definitely gives one. Ok, I really think I am mad now. All the best, Alicki",

From what you say, it sounds like you have inflammation somewhere. I asked for the MRI because I just couldn't deal with my breast surgeon answer 'oh, sometimes we discover it months later', that REALLY drove me crazy. It's hard, sometimes I want to give up but who can fight for yourself, if not yourself??? My other doc said, 'I'll do this for you but you'll never be satisfied with the answers you get', and perhaps I am at the other end of the spectrum and don't know where to stop.. I wish I were nearer to you, I would accompany you to the appointments but I'm a bit far away. However, if the dermatologist is a failure (which I hope not), and you want to meet me in London to go to the clinic I went to, or the skin clinic, I'll accompany you. Meanwhile, take one step at a time, go to the dermatologist and then see. I don't know how much it would cost you but I have the best dermatologist in the world in Switzerland (and the most understanding) so even if I have never seen you, if you fancy coming here for a few days for an appointment, be my guest. He's a specialist in auto-immune diseases too. It would make him laugh that I went to GB and you would be coming to Switzerland. However, he would definitely get to the bottom of your problem, and you would be welcome to stay with me. America isn't an option. I'll never get past the medical criteria for the visa and there's no way I am going to try and get in and say I'm a tourist, I don't want any trouble with uncle sam! It a way, it's good, because it slows me down. I have nonetheless make an appointment for 7th Nov in London to see top notch again. I was thinking of a breast reduction but I'm not quite sure one of my work contracts will be renewed so I think I need to start being careful about money. But if my lymph nodes don't go down, I want them biopsied and checked, especially the 2cm one, but there was so much inflammation going on in my body yesterday, that even the right side blew up to 1.53cm. And I am thinking seriously of seeing a specialist to deal with trauma if the MRI and lymph nodes are clear because I need to stop somewhere. Rhumi appointment is for the end of November. I want to get to the bottom of this inflammation. Did you know that our post has the most views at the moment? I'm not sure who is reading us, but there you go. take care, and give a think to my Swiss idea. Cheers, Alicki",

Apparently, my energy was all over the place (which I could feel myself). I managed to sleep last night without sleeping pills, first time in. Months. Not sure how much I need to read into it but I feel better. They also showed me how to keep connected with my inner self by thinking of a special time in my childhood. They always work together to validate what the other is feeling. They didn't feel any tension around my breasts, which what usually happens when someone has an illness there. They did feel my liver but I sometimes get pains there (stress) and it has been checked and all is fine. Chinese doc pointed out liver area too. Meanwhile, I had asked the radiologist to recheck my latest MRI scan because he noted a biopsy location I could not see on scan. He s was ADORABLE, he rechecked everything to make sure there was nothing funny there and then phoned and wrote me back a note when I thanked him. So docs are human after all! From my experience, they are more human in private clinic and facilities than hospitals (aside my nice dermatologist). I still have my pinholes to get seen to this week but honestly with assurances coming both from alternative and western medecin, I'm feeling much better. It's all a question of monitoring. I wouldn't go back to the UK though, because as helpful as he was the first time, I really reall didn't like the rush attitude the second time. Moreover, I received a letter telling me that he had explained to me the risks of breast reduction and I really feel he didn't. I still think he's very good but just trying to do too many things at the same time. By the way, I also had a Hsysterectomy. Mine was at 37 due to inflammation of the uterus lining. I kinda miss my periods . Sometimes people who have had hysterectomies get B9 breast problems later, I think its just that we ve messed up our systems a bit . If you don't get answers then this time go private. There are plenty of walk in clinics both for dermatologist problems and breast. You can't keep waiting.... hope the stabbing pains have gone??

Shortly followed by an outburst of fatty lymph nodes (which I still have), redness, thickened skin and one breast growing a bit bigger than the other. The local hospital put me under surveillance for IBC, not quite sure if I had cancer or an episode of mastitis (not lactating). They never gave me a diagnosis and left me lingering, with comments such as 'well if it's IBC, it will show up sooner or later'.  I was alone. So I went to see various specialists (abroad and the very few here) and all excluded IBC (inflammatory breast cancer) without telling me what had happened to me. In this process, I lost 18 kilos, why I don't know. I finally decided to get a breast reduction as a way to get some answers because even MRIs were not giving answers. The biopsies was just saying  that I had inflammation That's when I found out that I had Fibrocystic breasts and hyperplasia of the skin. The pathologist who I know and trust 100%, told me that I would need to be checked twice a year.  I  hope this explains why I am anxious. I am working on being less anxious, but all this fibrocystic breast issue is totally new to me. The only thing that I'm happy about is that I know now what explained the happenings of my left breast. I had a hysterectomy in 2010 (internal endometriosis) and at that time, I did not have fibrocystic breasts (exams done). I don't have dense tissue but fatty tissue so at least I don't have that issue. THank you for replying to my query and I apologize if I come across as a little mad. Switzerland is a small country and there are very few Breast surgeons. Here OB/GNY usually do breast operations, because there's no specific breast surgeon training, OB/GNY train for 'top' and 'bottom' and then some of them specialize in 'top' or 'bottom', mostly 'bottom' if I am making any sense, lol! There are a good few, but few, and even fewer in the French speaking part of Switzerland where I live So, I guess that's why I'm a little cranky (and I avoid Dr google because I would go mad). That's for the information you have provided me with. alicki",

I think one needs to find the right balance between one's anxiety and concern about their breast health. I just found out that I have a massive area of fat necrosis (after breast reduction), and am trying not to get anxious over it, (it's a b9 condition). However, for my peace of mind, am asking a 2nd radiologist to check the MRI images and am going to talk to my PS. Funny, it's the other breast (right one this time!) Melissa: I would say that you are right. Anxiety stemmed from not feeling that I could trust the doctors I was seeing. And it drove me to a breast reduction to get the answers I needed, (they wouldn't do a core biospy at the time). As you know that showed FB and ductal hyperplasia without atypia, and at last I got an indication as to WHY I was having inflammation and so on. In the process, I lost 20 kilos in six months which made the anxiety shoot through the roof and all of a sudden, I started growing cysts in weird areas. I then started seeking help and my doc put me on medical leave the time to deal with the anxiety (back to work in June). Meantime, more inflammation on right breast, and MRI was ordered and it happens I have an area of 9cm *3cm of fat necrosis and lots of scar tissue that is still inflammed. (GRRH). So it's not all an anxiety problem but anxiety I would say caused breast problems. And what was really bad for me was that I had endless waiting between biopsies and was thrown to the ground by one doc who said to me: 'you know, in some cases, we've only found out it was IBC, after a few months'. That really made me freak out! I rarely come here now and try and stay off any BC related pages (apart of my therapy). Today, I just happened to come. I feel vulnerable whilst I am usually quite a strong and determined person.  Anxiety can destroy a life and I'm lucky because as far as I know, I don't have BC. I have learnt one thing: you can't diagnose yourself. Find docs you can trust and then trust them. No, they are not Gods, but nothing is 100%.  I now have the surveillance that I wished for and the reassurance of knowing that if ever anything nasty comes up one day, it (hopefully) will be caught early. That's all I am asking for. Thanks for reading my thoughts  Alicki",

Stay away from what triggers the anxiety. This site doesn't in a strange way, it shows me that there is a community of strong women facing bravely all sorts of breast related problems, and as weird as it sounds, that thought comforts me.

So that is one less thing to be anxious about. Sarajane: yes, you've put your finger right on it 'loss of control' which has driven me to anxiety free classes and in my case, I still have those 'ghastly' fatty lymph nodes (2cm), although now one is growing on the right side (1.67cm) due to inflammatory fat necrosis and scar tissue which means that it's probably due to inflammation. In your case, you found a doc compassionate enough to do a dissection, for me here it's impossible. Fatty = B9 in 5 radiologists (very good ones, one is the best in Europe) that I have seen. For my peace of mind, could you remind me what they found in your 'fatty lymph nodes' and if you had fibrocystic breasts? I'm going to see my British surgeon and Plastic surgeon (he does both) and am going to discuss mascetomy. I know it's a big decision but I would like to look into it. He has agreed to do it. My breasts inflame all the time, and I really don't want to deal with this forever. I'm not saying that I will do, but might....could you tell me a bit about recovery (no reconstruction for me).

This fibrocystic breast thing only came out after I removed my womb and had a breast reduction which told me what had been going on. Here in Europe, they say it's unsafe to get two mammos a year and we usually do one every two years because of the radiation.  Your advice is straightforward and very sensible. My breasts had behaved themselves until I was 40 and then had  dreadful pain, redness, (read above for the rest) and suddenly fatty lymph nodes, still there.  I go to the local breast surgeon here (one of the best in Switzerland) and am also seen once a year by a Breast specialist and Breast radiologist (among the best) in England. If I have learnt something from these boards, is not to see always the same doc or radiologist, because four eyes are always better than two. Moreover, I will try and get a MRI to follow up the 3d mammo done here by Swiss specialist. Meantime, I need to learn to relax. Weirdly, I also have a cyst on my kidney 0.5cm (Bosniak 1) and 12mm cyst on abdominal wall. We watching them every six months with MRI, but they are causing me ANY anxiety. I even refused to have a laproscopy to have the 12mm cyst removed. I will re-evalate in 6 months if necessary So being pro-active? definitely.  Best Alicki",

I agree 'better living with chemistry' instead of hiding under the covers. Fear, with or without cancer, can eat you alive. I'm attending groups twice a week now and have got medicine, I tried a day without it and was shaking. I don't know if Buspar exists out of the US but will check. I don't feel depressed, just very anxious.  I still have the impression that something is 'off' but just can't pin if it's my anxiety of 9 months of going through procedures or just my gut feeling. I've seen one of the best specialists in the UK so said that it was not IBC, and nothing has indicated that in the breast reduction material (got 500g taken out each side). BUT what still gets me, is that I have soft fat replaced lymph nodes since all this started, and I can't get ANYONE to biopsy them, they just monitor them with US. There's nothing in the breasts, (at least as for as the 'O' mammogram, I'm just scared something is lurking in the lymph nodes.... In the middle of this, two 'cysts' appeared in my body, we checked them yesterday and they have grown 1mm so yes, they are cysts, just bad timing for them to appear and even worse timing for my anxiety.

There's a whole grey area between B9 and cancer- And sometimes, even if it's not cancer, we would like to KNOW what is going on with our breast, hence we share. Thanks to Sarajane, who doesn't have cancer, and at least understands! alicki",

Now I have histological proof.  So maybe the weight loss is just me freaking out I know the FNA is also B9 but I wanted to be sure that the surgeon got the Fat necrosis in right breast which is now growing bigger than left breast - will this ever end. I have asked him why and he will get back to me tomorrow. For tonight, I'm happy about the results. He took out the biggest lymph node. Am feeling more secure.  Will go to London in October for re-evaluation-  Best for now, Alicki",

Breast reductions and scarring complicate readings of MRI but if we have previous scans (baseline), comparaison, can give the breast radiologist an idea what's going on, correct? I was led to believe if it doesn't enhance it's not cancer but are things so simple? Sorry to bug, I have b9 conditions and am glad but sometimes even these conditions need monitoring and I don't like the indent but with a surgeryreduced breast, it could be anything!! I ll update tomorrow after seeing my breast radiologist. It's different where I live, radiologists do most exams and read straight away. Thanks djammo! Alicki",

      "Content": "alicki wrote: hello, I had a breast reduction and was initially told that it doesn't modify the risk of getting cancer. Yesterday I met with a plastic breast oncologist surgeon (he does both: oncology and breast plastics).  He said that yes, in case of FB, even without atypia you do reduce your risks because you re taking off some of the tissue that could become cancerous. I noticed a few years ago that someone on this site had mentioned the same thing. I wonder if any research has been done in the US on this. I went from cup E to C.  And no (I hope Melissa is reading me), you don't need a BMX for your breasts if they are without atypia. Right there gal :-) FB is no longer known as a disease but a condition and lymphatic massage greatly helps the circulation in the breasts to get better.  Anyways, I have at last found two docs and a radiologist I can trust. I wanted to get a mammo done but as I had to have an emergency procedure here in Switzerland they said 'no' and the radiologist wasn't too happy about the low quality resolution of the mammography. I have now learnt that in addition to all our other concerns, we need to make sure that the digital mammograms being used by our radiologists are of high resolution. Seriously?  European docs are allergic to the idea of mammographies more than one a year which explains why we are being sent for ultrasounds and MRIs all the time. They fear that radiation will induce cancers  Lastly, from another doc here, I found out that the 3D can be used with only one dose of radiation. In case of doubt, they will do an MRI. They are MRI mad here I think.  Don't know if any of this info can be helpful but wanted to post anyway Best, Alicki Log in to post a reply",

The hospital in my countrY were refusing to clear me and had put me on a grueling. Wait and see 12 month approach but I travelled to the UK. The only thing is at the time all the stress and anxiety set off sleep apnea causing terrible non stop 24 h headache and white matter showing up in the brain. Sleep apnea causes brain damage by lack of oxygen at night when you stop breathing I was so anxious that I believed that I had mets to brain when in fact once the sleep apnea was discovered and found and treated, things went back to normal . But I was completely off the charts and because of my huge breasts, got a breast reduction that led to post op complications which told another year and a half to solve. Meanwhile I was a walking zombie.... So my only comment or piece of advice would be to make sure you get piece of mind and get checked out as you wish.  I can't tell u if its cancer or not but just make sure you have peace of mind. I nearly ruined my life over this, I lost my job, friends, home and nearly my mind Now I get things checked and make sure I have docs I can trust. I still have a little fat necrosis and fatty weird lymph nodes which we are keeping an eye on and my birad scores are usually '3' hence the six month checks All the best Alicki",

I went to the extreme of reducing my breasts to get answers which created a whole lot of other problems. I was convinced I would be dead by Dec 2015. Finally I had lymphatic congestion and sleep apnea but the while uncertainty gave me panic attacks I didn't even know existed - I beg of you don't go there. I went crazy because the medical follow up was so bad where I live to the point that my GP wrote a letter of complaint and I ve now got a specialist I need to have Anxiety gets me too, but I have learnt that knowledge is power and learnt to advocate and to get good docs I can trust. When it gets too bad, I do some meditation and breathing techniques and if it gets too bad I grab an Ativan. My experience is this and from what I'm reading so is yours. It may quack like a duck, look like a duck but that doesn't mean it's a duck!!

Secondly, FYI I am monitored every six months for BC because ovarian cancer and uterine cancer runs in the family and load of b9 issues. I myself have just had to remove an ovary and hysterectomy... I am grateful not to be have been diagnosed but I do watch my breasts and report changes de breast surgeon and radiologist. I have extensive scarring and fat necrosis in breast. If my radiologist didn't take me seriously, then no way could I get an appointment in 24h which I have. Do I worry about my breasts? Of course I do but not over anxiously. I did in the past and have now dealt with that. But when you have hard masses in the breast, a little worry and reporting changes is normal especially if they are new. If someone gave me the green light years ago and said \"don't ever worry about your breasts in your life\", that would have been great! But of course, as you know it's never like that. So I monitor and report changes and do a bi-annual check-up. But in between, I rarely come here anymore I think that before providing information on whom I am, you may wish to get the opportunity to know me. And as the mods have informed me, I have every right to post on the undiagnosed section of forum. So before saying \"I am one of those, you may wish to ask me directly\". I WAS crippled by anxiety in the past but just like you, have learnt how to deal with it. I hope that this has set things straight, once and for all  Best wishes, Alicki",

      "Content": "Mar 5, 2014 01:24PM - edited Mar 5, 2014 01:26PM by alicki Hello,  I'm going to reply because my situation is quite like yours. Partial Hysterectomy in 2010 (still have ovaries), Breast reduction in 2013, further to inflammation and pain (reduction material showed fibrocystic breasts, left is worse than right too :-). There was a cancer scare because I thought it could have been IBC and docs were watching it for that but no cancer was found.  I'm having my breasts checked twice a year, once with 3D mammogram  (apparently 20-25% better) + ultrasound and once with MRI + ultrasound, six months apart. I live in Switzerland and here MRIs are quite easily given. I try and stay away from fatty food and sugar, the only difference with you is that my breasts are fatty and not dense. That having been said, the breast reduction caused scar tissue and fat necrosis so I suppose that equals dense breasts. I know I have 2x chance of getting BC, I'm not so worried about it, but I'm doing everything I can in case I do get it, to get it caught early.  I also get 2* week lymphatic massages (30 min per time) done by specialized therapist (a fantastic American lady). It activates the circulation and it feels good. Apparently, it's good for FB, but that's just my internet research that has said that. Nipple discharge is normal (if bilateral) and common with fibrocystic breasts. What I am wondering, if there's a link between hysterectomy and FB. If you want to PM me, do not hesitate. Best regards, alicki",

The onc also checked me out and I am to return in six months if I want to. Meanwhile, I have a mammogram scheduled here in Switzerland in 2 months time (this place doesn't know I have done one, here they dont like to irradiate you more than necessary) and in case of doubt, I will get a MRI done. Basically, I have two breast surgeons/onc, one here and one in England. Always good to get second opinions. Had 3 MRIs last year, all were fine. They might do a US on top of the MRI et MRI does not show clear results. I am a rare case, I have fatty fibrocystic breasts so easy to see, no density. this might be because I had a child quite young (19). No idea.  Try and get the MRI done at a BREAST centre by a specialist in breast care, not any radiologist. that would be my advice anyway.  Now, in terms of the procedure, it's uncomfortable but doable. You can have a look on youtube. Let me know how you get on Take care, Alicki",

For your peace of mind, you could seek a second opinion by seeing another breast surgeon.  I just make sure I do regular check-ups, once a year. From what I've heard, if it's both breasts, it's less a matter for concern. If you do find out why you are leaking from both breasts, I would like to know. This is puzzling me too.  I'm overweight, could it be due to that? Will seek a second opinion to find out. If your mammo and ultrasound are ok, I wouldn't worry too much but caution is always good.

Mine was done by a plastic surgeon but an onc was in the background and due to my insistence, EVERYRHING removed was sent to pathology and ANALYSED. All came back fibrocystic which explained what was going on.  Let's take this from a logical point of view, if you cut stuff off, cancer can't grow there although it can grow elsewhere. Moreover, screening becomes easier. I'm monitored both here and in the UK. UK onc is one of the top five in the country and I trust him. There are also cultural differences between Europe and US. Here mascetomy for DCIS is uncommon and my onc here keeps saying that studies shows that life expentency is no different between lumpectomy and mascetomy. I don't know personnally. To my horror, I read that someone on the boards had a tumor come back after mascetomy on surgical scar.  IN the US, and correct me if I'm mistaken, you can get a mammography done twice a year or have many views done Here it's considered as a health risk and no way they will do it, they prefer to do an MRI instead or ultrasound. So BC care is also determined by culture practices.  Anyways, our experience is interesting. I think in addition exercise and healthy food can make a difference. I don't have atypical cells ...yet at least.  Monitoring provides reassurance and after that you just get on with life and hope for the best. Best Alicki",

If I see that the breast reduction has made it impossible to read the mammograms, I will go the same way. Did you need to insist or did the surgeon just go ahead with it?  I'm the same age as you.
