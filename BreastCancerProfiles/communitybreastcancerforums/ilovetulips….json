The itching has happened off and on since the first surgery but this week it has been driving me crazy! I'm wondering if there isn't something to the stress connection. I had to go babysit my three grand daughters last week and even though they are great it's still stressful. I have to be mindful of rubbing, scratching etc. because I'm so itchy I'm don't think about it even in public!! Probably not what people want to see!! The back scratching sounds plausible so I'm going to give that a try. Thanks so much for sharing ladies",
