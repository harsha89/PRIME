I found that by squeezing that \"ooze\" out of my toes after bathing in a hot bath with epsom salts, the problem seemed to subside.  The clincher, though, was buying Earth shoes.  I'm still wearing them, because I've got that nail over nail thing still going on.   Anyway, the Earth shoes take the weight of your body OFF OF YOUR TOES!  I found this to be key in my own foot recovery.  The shoes have an inverted heel.  Your heel is lower than the ball of your foot and your toes.  Give them a try!  I really thought I'd never be able to walk without pain again until I found them!
