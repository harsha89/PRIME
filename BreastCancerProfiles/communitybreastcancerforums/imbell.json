A breakthrough therapy to modify patients' T-cells into potent tumor-killing agents has helped three leukemia sufferers stay cancer-free for a year, US researchers said Wednesday. The findings are the first to show how gene transfer therapy can create specialized T-cells, which guard the body from infection, that attack cancerous tumors in advanced cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The technique helped patients who had little hope of survival fend off their cancer and stay in remission, said the research published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine and Science Translational Medicine. Further studies are needed, but the advances offer hope to people who suffer from similar cancer types such as ovarian, lung, myeloma and melanoma Those further studies are in progress.

In addition, the Medicaid and  Medicare benefits that accrue to Social Security beneficiaries  can reduce the health insurance costs to a LTD carrier.    In a best case situation, your LTD carrier can help your Social Security lawyer work your Social Security case as the LTD adjustor may have a complete medical file.  Other times LTD carriers offer no assistance.    You need to find out what your LTD policy says about Social Security.  If you are receiving LTD benefits while you are waiting for a Social Security decision, and you eventually win your Social Security claim, your LTD provider may require you to pay back all of your lump sum to the LTD carrier as part of a reimbursement clause.    Some LTD carriers will pick up the cost of your Social Security legal fees, while others will not.  Here, too, you need to find out your carrier's policies as early as you can so you can make an informed decision regarding legal counsel.    If you are receiving or applying for long term disability, make sure to advise your Social Security lawyer WHO ARE THE FORUM POLICE. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE OUTED",

There are positive stories on some of the other forums though and even on the Stage IV. I lost my belief in prayer back in 1976. The church had regular prayers for my mother-in-law for months to no avail.  There is hope. There are a number of research facilities both in the U.S. and all over the world working on a vaccine. Some will begin testing next year. Hugs to all.",

Last July felt a twinge and sure enough the cancer had returned or never went away. I had one test after the other and finally in November the onc put me on Xeloda. Took me off of Arimidex. Have been getting Pamidronate shots since last December. Took Xeloda for 4 courses but there was progression on the pet scan done two weeks ago, so onc took me off.  I am only on the Pamidronate. Have more tests coming up.  Saw the radiation doc last week. He questioned why I wasn't on hormonal therapy even if the Arimidex did not work. I feel that my treatment has been iffy. Decisions are only made when I go to the office. Am I panicking unnecessarily. What is the treatment for a triple positive. Should I pursue the radiation route. Won't cure it but would cut back on the pain and discomfort or am I taking a chance by not going on Abraxane immediately. P.S. I had a local recurrence in the same spot and various nodes in the mammary chain.  One of my online buddies died last year. Her cancer went into her lungs and then her heart.

Oncs in Canada count pills and measure medication. The mess they create is someone else's problem. For anyone else with the same problem I should have started the zinc ointment sooner ie the day of my chemo. The other strange side effect of Abraxane this time is extreme itching - the tops of my hands, my stomach and my thighs. Have Betamethasome but it is not doiing much.

This is what I have since learned. Most chemos are taxanes. The difference is the suspension that is used to deliver the chemo. Taxtols can cause allergic reactions, Taxanes not so much. Weekly taxol was suggested as an option. I would have accepted but I have been okayed for Abraxane and am hoping for lesser SEs.",

Have you taken advantage of disability tax credits. I am retired but I have a disability certificate at Revenue Canada that saves me about $900 in taxes and is transferable to spouse. Some doctors can't figure it out but my family doc had cancer and one of the criteria is that you take daily medicine to stay alive. My drug was Arimidex. Taxes can be reassessed for up to 4 years. Coupons are a waste around here but store brands are a better deal. Safeway, Superstore and Sobeys all have them. Check out the flyers on Flyerland.ca but you have to know your prices. We are retired. I couldn't pry any money out of my life insurance company but our house appreciated in value considerably. We have a credit line based on the house mortgage.  Doubt either one of us will make it five years and we both have life insurance. Our heat and electricity are on a monthly budget. We couldn't pay our winter bill if we weren't. Manitoba has a life saving drug program which is a good thing because as retirees our Blue Cross drug benefit is $450 per year. If anyone needs to keep warm, check out electric mattress pads. Better than a blanket because they don't get as hot and it doesn't fry your shoulders while your feet freeze over. When I am on chemo I get cold chills plus achy joints from the side effects. It has been a life saver One more thing we had a new toilet put in and new showerhead (the new kind that save water). Can't believe our water bill was halved and we haven't noticed any difference. The toilet is only a 6 litre but flushes very hard (from Rona) and the shower head has an aerator so you feel like you are getting the same amount of water as the old one. I forgot Dollarama for kitchen iutensils, towels, tools, birthday decorations, kids and adult gloves, food items, etc. Most of their stuff is now $1.25 but that is still less than most stores.",

Have to be driven everywhere cause I am still mobile but not that mobile. Hubby likes to be at Wal Mart at 8 A. M. I don't want to get up that early. Miss work even though I am 66. Wanted to work at least part time. Spend all my time at one hospital or another getting to know everybody. I've worked at 2. Hate when people get all twitchy cause they don't know what to say. I still have hair so I tell them I am fine just getting a check up. I am going to the beach dressed as a Middle Eastern Person; the nurse laughed. Yes. there are 3 sided cabana type tents used for babies and kids but plenty big enough for an adult to sleep in. Made of the same parachute type material as umbrellas; a recliner, bottles of water and a battery operated fan. Sounds fine to me. I too am sick of being tired all the time mostly due to side effects rathern than the cancer itself. I do notice that I am slightly better when my grandchild comes over. P.S. Diarrhea can make you exhausted. Lomotil works great. It is a prescription drug.",

She may even be able to do an implant if she doesn't have radiation.  There is a website called Guidelines in Oncology. Once she gets her pathology report and it does take a while, you can follow her treatment and see if she is getting the care she requires. Depending on her report it could be chemo and radiation followed by hormone therapy. Every test and scan takes time burt have patience because this cancer did not come up overnight.

Am trying Femara but would prefer Faslodex as onc says Femara is too much like Arimidex but don't want to do chemo. All the above are hormonals and easier to take than chemo. I am past menopause. Femara and Herceptin have worked for quite a few women. Herceptin is a targeted therapy for women who are HER2-. Good luck to your mother and hugs to you.",

Our health care is free everywhere but it is the 4 large provinces that seem to have the cancer centres, try innovative techniques and the clinical trials. Here in Manitoba they tell you to go out and have fun, have a drink when you are past eating. That is another whole story, the Tale of the Evil Oncologist . Switching is difficult also as there are limited number of oncologists and they work together. I digress sorry.  Xeloda is easy if the dosage is right 4,000 x a day was too much for me but 3,000x2 was tolerable. There are other drugs besides immodium.",
