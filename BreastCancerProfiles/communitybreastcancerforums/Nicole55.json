I am beginning to be so anxious, I can wait that all of those horrible things to be in the past.  The week will be long, alone at home.  My husband is working, I have two daughters, one who is 32 and working full time + she have 4 kids,  and one who is 23 and live in another province.  I am planning to go back with my younger daughter and son in law to New Brunswick after Christmas hollidays but I don't know my appointments for january.  If it is possible I could go with them and come back home by train 3 or 4 days after.  I would like to have something to change my mind.

I guess that it is not the same thing from a family to another family.  Our family care very much for each of us.  I have my syster left and she was at hom when I arrived from the hospital and I was so glad.  Maybe in your partner's family they were not close as you are with your parents and that is why I think that your partner don't understand the \"family power\".  Try to think about his life as a child and maybe that will give you some clues about how he feels about family now.  Some people leave their parents for universtity or work and never or almost never see them afterwards. You are so lucky to hame your mom and dad with you and all they want is your recovery.  My husband is a family man, he is very close with his brother and sisters, sometimes I find it too much but I can understand that he needs to be with them and share with them. Try to talk with your boyfriend and I am pretty sure that he will understand.  For now, all of this is so unusual for us and gave us a lot of stress and anxiety.   Probably it is because he loves you very much and needs to be the only one for you.  Sometimes man don't talk very much and we have difficulties to deal with their mind because they don't talk enough about what is scaring them. Best wishes to you and your family xxxx Nicole",

I hope that I will start rads in January and get back to work asap and forget about all this bad experience. hugs Nicole xx",
