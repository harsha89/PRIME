Thanks so much for your lovely replies, they were appreciated so much in my hour of need...big {{hugs}} all round! And good luck for your future results rcl4145, I will keep all crossed for you and hope you too get happy news! Well after a sleepless night I got the best news I could have expected really. I was told today that they have removed all the ADH with clear margins, only DH in the margins, and was told they have no idea why the ADH/microcalcs cluster were there in the first place, but all is gone now, and no malignancy was found. So I will get checked again in 12 months to be sure there is no recurrence. The floodgates opened when I left as 4 weeks' tension had to go somewhere but I am so relieved, I feel slightly silly for over-worrying now... There's just one concern left for me to address and ask about right now if I may: can ADH or microcalcs just randomly pop up again around or near to the excision site or even in the other breast? If so (similar to if ER+ DCIS had been found and Tamoxifen would be advised) is there any way to temper that possibility? Does anyone know? I just want to be as vigilant and proactive as possible. Thanks again for all the hugs and kind words, you ladies are all wonderful! xxxxx",

I wish you both the very best of luck and I'm sending you hugs for now and the future with this message. I know I'll be fine and will handle whatever comes my way next week, because I'll have to, it's as simple as that. It's the not knowing that's so petrifying. So you were both in a similar situation with very different outcomes? It kind of confirms what I suspected. This really could go either way right? Either ADH only and I'll get closely monitored or it could be something like DCIS, hopefully early stage (I've guessed that's what they're checking for). I've also read somewhere that ADH can be the tip of the iceberg so to speak and that's why they did the excision biopsy. Not wanting to worry Julie of course, but can ADH ever stay just that? Or do you think, as I've read in many forum messages that this is the inevitable pattern: DH>ADH>DCIS>IDC? I absolutely believe my surgeon will not want to worry me and will withold info if I even ask her that, but honestly, I'd much rather know the score and your thoughts. I was previously so naive about BC; there's so many variables at all stages it makes your head spin. Julie yes, I was numbed both times, for the stereotactic and the wire insertion, I was just crushed in lots of different angles in a few different machines, I think I had about 6 mammos for the initial stereo and ended up having about 12 for the wire that also had to be adjusted twice as they didn't quite get the spot and it coiled in on itself. I didn't feel the wire insertion or adjustments at all due to the numbing, but the initial numbing job was badly done; he jammed the needle in and wriggled hard which was very painful and made me cry. He apologised complaining I was so dense there! So all that even before the excision op under a general anaesthetic - so I was sore as hell the next day and now, 1.5 weeks later, it's only just settling down, no pain meds as of yesterday. I know it's a breeze for some people so maybe density does make it all more difficult? Anyway, big {{{hugs}}} to you both, I'll have to just suck it up and see, I'll keep you updated. ",

I hope it's nothing to worry about. I'm still in pain from my excision biopsy after nearly 2 weeks, is that normal, does anyone know? I have a weird swollen lump with sharp shooting pains, plus a faint pink-red patch on my skin above this lump (all this is about 2 cm down from the excised lumpectomy area)...oddly the pink patch also appeared after my first needle biopsies which was higher up still, and I was concerned it was an infection and saw my GP who prescribed penicillin. I hate to take drugs so I held off to see if it would worsen, but it faded. I assumed naively that it may have been a mammo burn or friction burn or bruising from being clamped so much but here it is again but worse! I will mention it on Tuesday but if anyone can relate please post. Thanks. I woke crying this morning, the most I've done in these last 4 weeks which wasn't much at all as I've been trying to be stoic. I'm struggling to be that today and feel so scared. My violent sporadic stomach lurches have turned into a constant hum of sickening dread that won't go away now until Tuesday no doubt. I wish Tuesday would hurry up but then again I don't because if it is bad news then at 41 I simply don't feel ready to have cancer :( x",

      "Content": "bigwig wrote: Hi girls I'm new here, 41, and a little scared. I'm from the UK but have little to no responses on the UK site I joined so I'm hoping someone can shed light on my situation on this one. I found a single prominent lump mid July in my left breast that felt quite sore, so I had it checked out by the GP the next day. She did a physical examination of both breasts and referred me to the breast clinic for a thorough checkup.  I had the usual mammogram and ultrasound and the left breast showed up as having not one but three (benign) cysts in the end, much to my relief as you can imagine. I then had a brief physical examination followed by my oncologist leaving the room to check the mammogram results again and calling me through for a quick chat. She had a magnifying glass against the x-ray and pointed out a cluster of about 15-20 microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of my right UNaffected breast; I had no idea what this was, and non-plussed, took her up on her offer to immediately do a wide-bore needle biopsy - I figured it was better than making another appointment and waiting. The biopsy was horrendous. I only have small breasts and the cluster was on the upper outer edge of the breast tissue, close to the chest wall, so it was tricky trying to get samples whilst being clamped lying down on my left side (it was impossible for them to do it with me sitting). My oncologist checked all 8 or so samples via x-ray and was satisfied she'd got enough microcalcs to get checked out. 4 hours later, on my way out and feeling a bit worried, I asked to be copied in on all letters of communication between my oncologist to my GP then went home, sore but not too bruised. The week wait was the worst thing ever. 2 days in I received the oncologist's copy letter to my GP's surgery informing them that 'physical examination confirmed dense breast tissue in the upper, outer quadrant with a slightly denser area more inferolaterally. Mammography showed a dense parenchymal pattern with low density rounded opacities in the inner left breast which were found to be cysts on ultrasound and a small cluster of very fine microcalcification in the upper, outer quadrant of the right breast which was indeterminate in nature and was biopsied'. I did a lot of research on the Internet after that. Results day finally came round and I was seen by a surgeon. She informed me that they had found 'evidence of abnormal cell activity but needed to do a wire-localisation surgery in 2 weeks' time and I'd get the results in 4!'. She assured me I do not have cancer but that it may be pre-invasive cancer. On the usual copy letter I discovered that the abnormality had a name: ADH, and after more research began to understand more why I was scheduled in to have a 6mm area plus margins removed under general anaesthetic, which went ahead a week last Tuesday. The wire localization was horrendous, the worst part - again tricky to do and took an hour, so painful and I'm sure it contributed to most of the post-op pain! It was bliss to get put out for the actual op!  So, whilst I near the end of my agonisingly slow second week of waiting for the final pathology results, can anyone tell me if their experience was similar and what the outcome was. I know what could possible be in store as I've read up on all the potential outcomes, I'd just like to make sense of all this and prepare myself a bit better, mentally speaking for next Tuesday - results day. I'm feeling quite petrified and wish I'd had a definitive yes or no result a few weeks ago and the wait is quite tortuous...so frustrating. Please help, I can handle the bad as well as the good, no worries, I'm ready, I just don't care for the wait any more :( Log in to post a reply",
