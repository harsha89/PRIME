However,  in October, tumor markers continued to go up and she said she would try one more chemo, Ixempra (YUK).  she tried it didn't do well and said enough is enough.  Hospice came in in November and they are a blessing.  She had a pulmonary embolism in September which was another set back and doc did not think she would make it to Christmas. Guess what _ SHE DID!!!!! as we sit her tonight and watch TV and I hear her laugh.  It all has not been pretty but she keeps on diggin.  NO one knows ho long we have, cancer or no cancer.  The only thing any of us are guaranteed is yesterday and we can only pray for the next day.  I give her IV fluids and she stays nauseated a great deal but give her IV Zofran which helps most of the time.  She too has made all  her plans.  This disease made her retire early as a state trooper after 25 years of service, but it has never taken her dignity.  She did not want me to have to worry about things so she plannerdher own service and let me know what she wants.  Stay strong, keep your spirits up and be thankful for every day you have.  God is the only one who knows how much time we have.  You along with so many others on this site have endured so much and are very strong women.  Don't dwell on how much time - no one earth knows that answer.  LIve each day to the fullest!  God bless you and you will be in our thoughts and prayers.",

My wife is 47 and I pray that she will make it to her 48th in July but that is becoming more questionable by the day.  She was diagnosed in 2006, came back in 2009 with metz to liver, brain - multiple chemos, stereotactic radiation and WBR.  Again I am sorry for your loss and may you and your family find comfort knowing that she is cancer free now.  Gary ",

      "Content": "spouse1 wrote: A new chapter for my wife and I.  My wife who is stage IV with metz to the liver and brain now has a new twist.  In our monthly visit to the Dr. she confirmed my thoughts that my wife now is a diabetic.  Have been noticing an increase in thirst and more frequent urination in the past couple weeks.  Her blood glucose level last month was 250 and yesterday was 350.  Her doc prescribed Glyburide to lower her glucose level. It appears that the diabetes is being caused by her steroid, dexamethasone which is used  to decrease swelling from the brain tumor.  We recently had to increase dex to decrease the swelling in the brain causing severe headaches.  She is taking 12mg per day of dex - up 4mg from two months ago.  This on-top of increasing weakness - walking with a walker now and she has what I call - the \"Grandma Shuffle\", the little short quick steps. Days consist of sitting in a chair, sleeping and generally feeling like crap.  I am thankful that she is not in  much pain for the most part.  All this at the age of 47 and hoping to get to her 48th at the end of July. I know we keep growing closer to the \"day\", but the doc sort of confirmed this yesterday as well.  She stated that my dear wife \"did great as long as she did\" ...  the key words were \"did\".  Doc went on to say that her strength would not return and that we would continue this progression.  And yes - more tears, long trip for me back to work after that. Anyway, to my question - have any of you taking dexamethasone experienced diabetes.  If so, what type treatments did you have? Thanks   Log in to post a reply",

You r so right.  I am so grateful that my wife is still with me although her activity level is low, most of her days are ok.  We have gotten her pain and nausea under control.  She has been in hospice since November and they are a wonderful help. Our doc told us the same thing that my wife would know when it is time to call it which was last October and I feel that if she would have continued with the chemo, she would not be with me today.  Although her activity level is no where near what it once was, I am so thankful that she is with me and we are able to enjoy the quiet evenings at home watching tv and just being together.  If there is one positive thing about this crappy disease, it makes you stop and truly take notice of the things and the people that are important in your life.  AT this point, bad days are good to me even although they are tough on her.   I am wishing you many wonderful days ahead of you.  Stay strong!",

We see Dr. Paul over at the Cancer center in Lynchburg as we are right across the river in Madison Heights.  Wishing you the best Gary ",
