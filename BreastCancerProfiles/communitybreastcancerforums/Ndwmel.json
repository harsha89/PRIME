I am having reconstruction surgery and could within the next week, but for me, I can't get pass the pain I'm having, why would I subject myself for another surgery so soon, while my body is already feeling so bad, I'm thinking I should wait, but some say, just get it over with, continue with the pain?  I am also emotionally drained, I had been in a car accident 8/13, suffered a concusion, then this a few weeks later.  To me my feelings are normal, my friends and family despite how much support they are not going thru what I am, I am a single mom, two kids and trying my best to be normal, but it's just not in me yet. Thank you for letting me share, I found this site by searching: the recovery time from a expander surgery - just happy I can read what others are going thru, make me feel a bit saner.
