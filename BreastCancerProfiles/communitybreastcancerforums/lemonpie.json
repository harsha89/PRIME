I took 5 rounds of paciltaxol(weekly) with no effect and my onc just switched me to gemzar/carboplatin for which I have had one treatment.  My question is I can feel some sort of dull pain under my arm where the lymph node is and was wondering what that means.  I never felt anything with my first cancer and I had a very large tumor (8.5cm) with at least 3 positive lymph nodes.  This new cancer is triple positive (old one was trip neg.)

She was upset because it was lunch time and she said she would like to eat like everybody else instead of being stuck there doing port flushes.  I told her that if I had my choice I would rather be the one GIVING the port flush than RECEIVING it but to have a nice day in spite of it all!!  She shut up and did her job!!   I hope you report her, people with that attitiude shoud find another profession.....",
