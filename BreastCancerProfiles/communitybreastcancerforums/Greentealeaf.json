After deciding between the core needle and fine needle, I decided to have a fine needle as it seemed the least invasive and I was so anxious. When my results came back the doctor said it was a cyst which confused me at the time as I thought cysts could always been seen on imaging and she never said it felt like a cyst. I asked to go back for a follow up a few months later, and when I went back and mentioned my concern she said 'Oh yes, it turns out it's NOT a cyst, the cytologist confused ALCOHOL solution (which the cells come in when they send it to the lab), with Cyst fluid???? I couldn't believe it. How could they make such a stupid mistake?? So now I'm feeling so anxious. The doctors think I'm being silly to worry, and think I should be reassured as they didn't see anything in the cells .. however how can I trust that the person looking at my cells can be sure it's nothing nasty there if they are incapable of telling the difference between alcohol solution and cyst fluid?? Should I have another biopsy - perhaps the core needle this time? I really don't want to if I don't need to, but I don't know what to do at this point. I have a lump, it's not going away, I've had it for a year, it's sore, the doctors aren't listening to me and now they've made a mistake with the results, but aren't taking it seriously. The ultrasounds are showing nothing. Perhaps I'm being overly anxious? Please help - has anyone else experienced this before? Thank you for reading, GT x Log in to post a reply",

I've had 3 ultrasounds - all of which have come back saying the can't see anything at all on the ultrasound and is probably just dense glandular tissue. It started hurting recently (though hasn't changed in size) so I went back to the breast clinic and they have offered to do a biopsy if I want one. I'm really not sure what to do, as I don't want an invasive procedure if it's just glandular tissue. However it worries me slightly that they can't see what it is, but can feel there is a lump. Please can anyone offer advice about what I should do .. Is it usual to biopsy on a lump which cannot been seen on the ultrasound and also on a lump which hasn't changed in size at all? Has anyone else had a lump which just hasn't gone away after a year and had no explanation for? They have also given me the choice between a fine needle and a core biopsy. I have absolutely no clue what to do! A core needle sounds like it is only used if something suspicious is seen ... Thanks in advance for your help and advice, I'm feeling so anxious about having to make this decision. x Log in to post a reply",
