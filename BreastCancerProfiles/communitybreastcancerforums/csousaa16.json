The doctor said he will need to make an incision right on the edge of my nipple so once it heals it won't be as noticeable. They still haven't discussed with me if I would be awake or not which is something I will need to ask them when they call me for my Pre- Op questions. I'm just an over thinker and I am worried that because they never biopsied that it will turn out to be something else. This will also be my first sugery of any kind!",

      "Content": "csousaa16 wrote: Hello Everyone, I'm going to apologize in advance for my long story. My name is Cindy and I am 21 years old. When I was around 15 years old I found a lump in my left breast. Out of curiosity the first thing I did was Google \"lump in breast\" and of course breast cancer came up. All worried, I told my mom and had a doctor check me out and It was diagnosed as a Fibroadenoma and was told that it was Benign. Because I was so young and it did not bother me at the time, I chose not to have it removed and just keep an eye on it every 6 months. I never had it biopsied; they would just follow up with ultrasounds. So like I said I am now 21... About a few months ago, I started to have sharp pains in my left breast. It was almost as if I had to hunch over to have some relief. It got to the point where it would bother me at work, and with simple movements, I would feel pain. I decided to go back to my doctor to have it checked out. My doctor suggested that I lay off the caffeine (I do drink coffee everyday) as caffeine can make breast tissue more sensitive. She also scheduled me for an Ultra sound. I did lay off the caffeine and it did help a little but I still felt pain. After I got my Ultra sound results, it was determined that my Fibroadenoma had grown (it's about 3cm) and they had also found another one. I cannot feel the second one they found- I can only feel the one that had grown, which is more obvious. My doctor decided to send me to a general surgery specialist but I honestly did not find him to be any help. He did a breast exam and checked my lumps and basically said what I already knew. He said, \"Well, you can either have it removed or chose to leave it and we can watch it\u2026\" I guess I was kind of hoping he would give me a better answer or his opinion on what I should do, but he just left it up to me. Of course, I chose to have it removed. Especially considering that I have never biopsied it, and I just feel like it does not belong. I could be over thinking it but I rather be safe than sorry. My surgery is going to be on Tue. Jan. 27th and I was hoping to get some feedback on anyone who has had this surgery done. I'm a little nervous but some questions I have are: How long was the surgery itself? How is the pain after the Surgery and how long does it last? How long until you can wear a Bra again? How many days do you need to recover and (if any) how many days should you expect to be home from work? Any complications with breast-feeding? Did you feel a difference in your breast shape? like an emptiness? These are just some questions that come to my head but any feedback on your experiences is appreciated. Thanks Log in to post a reply",
