I hope my post makes sense.  The pain patch makes me feel a bit fuzzy :) Dx 3/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Have been very depressed for the past few weeks.  Got a prescription for Effexor.  Hopefully that will make me feel better. I have been reading all of the posts from you wonderful ladies and am thankful that you are here to guide me and to support me.  I want to be here to support all of you as well.
