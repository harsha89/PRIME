Mainly hips, knees, elbows and tops of my legs! Every day when I get up, when I rise from a chair or the car or whatever, I'm stiff and it bloody well hurts. I never had anything like it before, but I did experience pain during the taxotere. I've often wondered if they are related. I have no idea when this might subside or if it ever will. The Onc doesn't seem very interested in the problem. Wants to write it off on menopause (which only came on as a result of the chemo).In any case, it is ongoing with no relief in sight. I fear this may be par for the course from now on. I am fit, exercise every day, cook all my own food, take vitamins, don't drink and smoke anymore. I'm frankly extremely disappointed at the attitudes of the Oncologists, who seem to dismiss any concerns beyond those that are most common. By the way, I now have, 4 months later, a pretty full head of hair, eyebrows (thinner) and eyelashes (not as long or as many as before). All the best, Sweetlander",
