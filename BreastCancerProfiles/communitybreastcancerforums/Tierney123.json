      "Content": "Jan 5, 2010 11:04AM - edited Jan 5, 2010 11:12AM by Tierney123 Wow - talk about timely.  I was just going to put a question out there about this myself.  My situation is this.  I am completely asymptomatic but was required to have an echocardiogram prior to my TE exchange surgery in a few weeks.  The requirement stems from a new protocol at my hospital for anyone who has had Adria in the past, prior to a surgery.  I figured it was just a routine thing to get out of the way, until the cardiologist called with the results and informed me that I have a lower than normal LVF (mine is between 40-45 and normal is 55-60).  The net is she wants me to go on an ACE inhibitor, which I'll be on for the rest of my life.  This will keep it from getting worse, and she said this kind of drop in efficiency is what they've seen as a side effect from Adria.  I did know that there was a side effect of heart damage, but didn't really worry about it since I'm young and otherwise in good health, with no history of heart issues (which is why I didn't have an echo prior to starting chemo).   I just saw my onc this morning and he agreed with my inclination to get a second opinion, which I've scheduled for this week.  Since I've never had an echo before, I don't know if I've always been between 40-45 (if that's possible), if medication is really needed before I have symptoms, etc.  My onc has been doing this for 30 years, is involved with a lot of research, and doesn't routinely see this as a side effect (even though they warn about it) so I'm having a hard time getting my head around it.   The other thing we're unsure of is if the fact that I'm BRCA1 positive could play a role.   I have loads of questions for the cardiologist and will post what I learn.      (Navygirl - can I ask where you learned about points #2 and 3 in your initial post, re: Cytoxan and method of delivery for Adria?  I have both of these counts against me, plus radiation to boot.  This was from my treatment in 2004.)   ",

I have a follow-up question to you fabulous ladies.  One of my frustrations is that I don't know what my heart function was like prior to receiving the chemo because I didn't have an echo pre-Adria.  Per my oncologist, it's not standard care unless you are older and/or have a history of heart issues, and I was young and in good health.  But, per my breast surgeon (at Georgetown) it's standard protocol there to be tested before and after. I'm trying to get a sense of how common it is to get an echo ahead of time.  Can folks weigh in as to whether or not you had the test, and if you did, were there any other factors (like family history or other health issues) or was it just part of the routine?  Thanks!    ",
