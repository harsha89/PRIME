That stinks that you have to now watch so carefully knowing that you may need further biopsies. Are you er/pr positive? Maybe you would be a candidate for tamoxifen hormone therapy. I will never feel truely cancer free only because my cancer did not show up in the biopsy. I will learn to accept that and every year I have clears mammal will be encouraging I am sure... On a good note, if more ADH shows up we could do excisional to know for sure. My friends are real supportive but I am sure they to not want to talk about it like all of us here do...

When I got there a nice lady gave me a pill and then proceeded to apply gentle compression with mamm machine while placing the wire in my left breast. They numb the area first. Then they put a coffee cup taped over it while you head up to surgery. As far as telling your younger kids. I told my older thee 19, 17, 15 and waited to tell my 9y/o daughter until after path report came back from lumpectomy. I sat down next to her on the couch while she was watching Tv. I started saying things like: youve heard of cancer right, you know how some cancers can make you real sick and some not so much, sometimes people loose there hair and sometimes not. She looked at me and said \"why are you telling me all this? Pause \"do you have cancer?\" I looked at her, silent cause the words were stuck in my throat. Tears welled up in my eyes and I said \"yes\"..... I hugged her and I said I am fine these are not sad tears, it is just hard to tell you because I do not want you to worry. I told her it is very fixable and. I will be fine. I didn't want her yo overhear conversations and really be scared. >",

Just don't like pain while they are doing stuff to me. The drain may be to prevent a hematoma. I wish I would have had a drain then I wouldn't have this large painful hematoma. Good luck tomorrow.

No magic pill or anything for that.............I found the lumpectomy to be ok. Good luck. After my first lumpectomy the doc scheduled me for an MRI to look at both Breast carefully. My right was good. Left side they found an area of concern from recent lumpectomy site to nipple area. May be from surgery but need an MRI biopsy to make sure.

I asked for double. Worse part was when they had to apply pressure to stop the bleeding. She was pushing right on the hematoma. She said it can take MONTHS for the hrmatoma to be absorbed, ughhhhhh! They ace wrapped me and sent me on me way. Results by Monday. If no more cancer I will have a lumpectomy. If cancer, bilateral mast... I took one xanax before. Only. 25 Mg. Told doc I will need stronger dose for the waiting game ahead of me. Whet did they do for you per op today?",

Never really saw that much color on any of my bruises. It is good that they put a drain in for you. Wish I knew more about hematomas beforehand. Do you have mch discomfort today? You did get a lot of good meds cause you sure slept a long time. That is funny cause I remember the face of my nice man too..., when I woke up I was very alert, went out for lunch and went to a football game to watch the band cause my son is a percussionist. I never felt sleepy. I too had a lot of swelling and still have half of it due to the hematoma :(. I just got done icing lefty.... I am scheduled for re excision on Oct 3rd with a cavity evaluation device. Hope you are feeling better soon.",

I have to say I think I wouldhave freaked out if blood came out of my nipples. I got a call Friday from the radiology nurse and all she said was to call her back and that she has good news for me. They were closed by the time I got home. Phone tag yesterday so I will try today. My only concern is that they did not find the dcis last time from the needle biopsy. It showed op only after lumpectomy sample wad biopsied. I feel good about it to a point. Re excision Oct 3or10. I am glad you are healing well. You will soon have this journey behind you. Keep in touch! Karen",

No. I was not out being the \"nice lady\", unfortunately. Haha. Running Here and there with the kids. Evenings are usually busy. Let me know when you have your appoint. so you can fill us in. I never had any discharge and my tata was so bruised you couldn't see and normal skin Color It was yellow, black, red and blue. Pretty color mixture, right? I also have bad bruising from the last MRI biopsy. The nurse left a message and said there is no cancer in the new area. But you know how my body likes to hide the cancer from the biopsies and rear its ugly head after a lumpectomy... I feel there is sn amazing sisterhood going on here in these chatrooms. This is a place we can share everything without sugar coating it. Karen",

I always wanted implants but was waiting til I got a little older in case they caused problems. I didn't really want yo go THIS far.. That stinks that you have to now watch so carefully knowing that you may need further biopsies. Are you er/pr positive? Maybe you would be a candidate for tamoxifen hormone therapy. I will never feel truely cancer free only because my cancer did not show up in the biopsy. I will learn to accept that and every year I have clears mammal will be encouraging I am sure... On a good note, if more ADH shows up we could do excisional to know for sure. My friends are real supportive but I am sure they to not want to talk about it like all of us here do... This is truely where I get my strength.",
