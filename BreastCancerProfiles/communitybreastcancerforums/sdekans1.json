Since before even taking the test I knew that if I tested positive for the mutation that I would have a prophylactic mastectomy. And I'm not going to lie, since I tested positive that step has become very hard and emotional but I know that this is definitely the right decision for me. Since I haven't even met with my doctors yet I don't know much about what happens next. I've been doing research and trying to educate myself so that I don't walk into my appointment completely in the blue. Most of what I've been reading on here has been super helpful. But I still have some questions... most of which I know will be answered on the 18th butttt I'm a little impatient and am curious to find this stuff out asap. For instance, now that I know Ive tested positive and I want to have the prophylactic mastectomy, how long will it take before I can actually have the surgery? I know I will have to meet with my doctors and everything but I'm just curious to know if I'm looking at something that is going to happen relatively soon like within the next couple of months? Or does this process take a while? I suppose I'm just a little eager to get this part over and done. I've also been looking into the reconstruction side of things and I think I may have an idea of the procedure Id like. Originally I thought I'd get the implants. I know that it's a bit of a quicker recovery but I don't like the idea that I'd have to have them replaced in the future. Also how real do the implants look? I've also been looking at DIEP, which actually sounds like a good option. But between DIEP and Implants, I'm just not sure yet what to do. Any advice, tips, suggestions? I read that with DIEP there's more of a recovery time but that it is only one surgery. How do they feel/look? As far as recovery times go with either surgery, when can you move around and drive and slowly start to get back to normal day life? I hope none of this seems silly, the reason why I ask is because I'm in a long distance relationship which involves a lot of traveling. We plan to get married within the next year as well and I will be moving up north where he lives. We are both prepared to handle the surgery and everything that comes with it while planning a wedding. He has been super supportive and amazing actually through this whole process and I know it may be a bit rough but I need my life to continue on as planned. I don't want to put things on hold or stop living my life because of this. So I'm just curious as to after the initial surgery when will I feel or start to feel like myself again? And if it's something that takes several months to plan out then maybe it's best if I wait until after we get married. Although I would much rather get this done sooner rather than later! Any other advice or information would be wonderful! I appreciate all of your input! Thanks so much! Stephanie Log in to post a reply",
