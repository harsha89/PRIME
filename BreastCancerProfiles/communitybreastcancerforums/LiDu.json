I sweat terribly, especially around my hairline and runs down my forehead. My family doctor and oncologist were slightly sympathetic and acknowledged the hormone imbalance, but they gave me nothing that helped. I discussed the problem (and others) with my gynecologist. She prescribed a very low dose of Effexor a few months ago and it worked like a charm, also helped with anxiety and insomnia, but the effectiveness has worn off somewhat. I saw a psychiatrist today who increased the dosage and made the prescription a time-release tablet. I'm hoping that takes care of the hot flashes and heat intolerance. Unfortunately, Effexor isn't for everyone, but it may work for some others here.",

Nine months since the end of herceptin treatment (and previous chemo, bilateral mastectomy and radiation), and everyone tells me how great I look. I wish I felt that great. Like so many others have mentioned, I have cognitive problems, anxiety, and depression as well as insomnia and fatigue. The only physical side effects that are obvious include continued low white blood cell count, weakness, and severe hot flashes. I've been on Effexor for three months and it was wonderful at first, but has become less effective and I'm bruising easily. Next step: Psych eval. Thanks for sharing everyone! If you have any advice, please share.",

I've been using coconut oil on my mastectomy scars and continue to use it on this new pink area. Up to this point, the most discomfort I've had is while on the treatment table. Lying with my arms extended over my head, holding onto a grab bar makes my hands and forearms fall asleep and become cold and stiff within minutes. I was also getting a lot of stiffness and pain in my right shoulder, but PT seems to be helping relieve that. I'm concerned that the radiation will worsen the mastectomy scar on my right side. It seems to be tightening and distorting more than on the left since I started radiation.",

My RO prescribed silvadene cream yesterday. I'm working full-time again, and I don't have much wiggle room with taking time off. I'm also getting herceptin treatments and PT twice a week (in addition to PT at home daily). So far, my energy has been pretty good as long as I take it easy in the evening and get plenty of rest. Still, I'm concerned that my skin is so red after just 12 treatments. My OR says I should have 25-31 treatments.",

I'll ask my RO about it. So far he's just given me an Rx for Silvadene, which is helping only minimally. I'm also using coconut oil, which my previous RO recommended. I noticed this morning that I have a raised solid feeling area of skin near the crease of my underarm. The tech seemed to think that was normal. Many have mentioned skin tightness, but mine feels more like tightness in the underlying muscle. I've been trying to keep up on my physical therapy, but it's becoming a challenge. 15 down, 10 to go!",

Those exercises consist of a combination of light weights, resistance with exercise bands, and arm bike. I have been seeing her twice a week and also have a regimen of stretching exercises that I do at home daily. Starting Jan. 1, I will go to once a week because I'm having trouble making it to PT twice a week while working full time and getting radiation as well as herceptin treatments. I'll also have to start paying co-pays and deductibles again.",
