I work in an ophthalmology office and have seen numerous women come in completely miserable with burning, pain, tearing, blurred vision, etc. They all regretted ever having LASIK done. Also, if your vision is fluctuating, as you seem to have indicated, that's also a contraindication to having the surgery. Your prescription needs to be more or less stable.",
