My surgery is the 18th. Will be thinking of you. My cosmetic surgeon was so nonchalant today. At first I thought - wow this is going to be a breeze. Then the feeling in the put of my stomach took over. I'm having serious short term memory problems. Making getting through this last week of work tough. Debmisto - oh no! So this means you are to continue with more chemo? My brother in law was telling me that next week \"should be his last week of chemo\" (stage IV esophageal cancer) I had a hard time understanding. So I'm wondering if that's how it goes. They have so many resources debmisto. Hope those docs offer up support and encouragement along with a big dose of optimism Greetings local librarian.

I had a serious health issue about 8 years ago. I kept everything to myself. Did not include my family. And it hurt them. This time I am trying a different approach. So I share more. My daughter did cry. My husband I'm sure cries alone. And my son -- not sure.. hard to tell. He seems ok. I do give them regular updates, including upcoming appointments and outcomes from the appointments. It appears to make them feel better. I hope your sharing time with family members is helpful for you.",

I am all too familiar with having difficulties with doctors. I actually switched my gynecologist and primary care provider just after my diagnosis -- just didn't suit me and I figured I'd better take care of it. But it is tough to find a doctor well suited to our particular style. One thing I do is google the doctor's name and look at reviews and comments. I've done pretty well with that. Do find someone ... is there a support group offered through the hospital? Anyway... I feel your distress and hope you find a way out. In the meantime we're all here with you.",
