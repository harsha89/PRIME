Thank you everyone for your prayers and wonderful advice.  Oh yes, she did take me off the premarin permanently.  I can live with the night sweats! Thanks again",

Thank you all for your words of comfort, wisdom and advice.  While I hope I don't have to come back here to seek advice or comfort again, I will definately return to see how everyone else is doing!  I wish you all the best!  You are a wonderful group of women!
