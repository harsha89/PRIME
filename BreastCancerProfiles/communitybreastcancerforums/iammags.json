But don't go off the deep end yet. I have had a couple of those that turned out just to be benign cysts or tumors. You can look up articles on wire guided biopsies and about micro calcifications. There's a lot of great women here with a lot of good info. Good luck!",

And, I'm getting my energy back, which is amazing! I'd like to tell everyone to hang in there. This part of life will soon be over. You know, this crazy BC ride was like speeding in a very fast car. Crazy turns right when I least expected it. Thought I was going right when, BAM, life turned to the left. And, now, after all of it, the brakes have been slammed, the ride is over (except for the Tamoxifen, which will go on for years). It's really pretty much over now. I saw my BS the other day and she says things look great. My next mammo is in one year (!!). I'll see my RO in July to check in and that's it. I do have other health issues that still need to be checked on but I am coming to terms with the BC chapter coming to a close.And it's weird to say, but I'm kind of numb. I was just diagnosed in February and it's been go, go, go since then. With research, and tx, and everything. I'm beginning to realize how PTSD can happen to BC suvivors. And, for all of you newbies, you've come to the right place. This site, and all of you lovely ladies, helped me so much along the way. I'm moving on, and so many are just starting this. Good luck to everyone. #RadiateThis!!! #CancerSucks #ThereIsAnEndInSight #YouAreStrongerThanYouThink!!!",

The stress and anxiety that you feel is real and it can take a serious toll on your body. Please consider accepting help. Plus, you don't have to be on the meds forever.

Guess where I'm dreaming of going? I'm Akumal bound! I'm so looking forward to doing nothing for 10 days! We leave the day the kids get out for summer break. Tomorrow is the big day for me. I've done the SIMs and start rads for real tomorrow afternoon. I wonder if I'll have some of the SE's that you all have had. It's going to be interesting. Have a good week everyone",

They are Bali brand, no underwire (which, after bilateral reductions I will NEVER have to wear again. Yippee!). They are about $15 and I've worn them since I've had my surgeries. They are not quite sports bras but they are just as comfy. Not so sexy, but, hey.. Loving, you were told not to wear a v neck shirt for a year? Wow. Really? What about a bathing suit? I\"m sure that you can get some super duper sun block if you wanted to expose your skin a bit. Like in a t shirt. I\"m so glad that you are half way through. My RO just added one more week on to mine. Newgirl- My skin is sensitive, too. I'm allergic to bandage glue. And, I'm always the one to get sunburnt. My skin is red after day 4 of rads. All the way from under my arm to my sternum. It feels a bit hot, but doesn't look that bad. I use Aquaphor at night but it's too sticky to wear in the daytime so I'm going to buy some Calendula cream today. Don't know what brand. I don't wear front closing bras so I can't tell you whether they would be more irritating than a back closing one. I don't like rads but I hate BC. I posted above that I am tired after day 4. But I am also sore. My BC breast is so tender and it's super tight when I raise my arm or reach in a certain way. This wasn't the case before rads. Anyone else with the same symptoms? Have a great weekend everyone. Rads are bad but Cancer SUCKS!  ",

I was so afraid they would think that I'm dying. I told them in a matter of fact way and tried not to make it a big deal. I'm glad that I finally said something because it's hard to keep a secret like that. Take deep breaths :)",

I have a lot of calcifications in both breast so I'm used to getting a closer look every time I have a mammogram. 6 months ago the radiologist found something in my right breast that he wanted to follow up on. After 6 months I went back to have it rechecked and it was fine. But (and big But here!) the radiologist found two lesions in another part of my breast. She biopsied the lesions right then and after 4 days of waiting for the results the pathology came back. Both lesions are cancer. One is DCIS grade 3 and the other is IDC grade 2. Shit. The BS says that it is very early and that she can remove it all. I'm having a lumpectomy on March 2nd and then the cancer will be staged and I'll see an oncologist. Then it's radiation. After that I don't have a clue. I am also very nervous about all of the details. I find that researching the cancer and the treatments helps me to be less scared. Knowledge is power. Because breast cancer is so common I have know several women who have had it and who've gone through various kinds of treatment. I am now part of a group that I never wanted to belong to but it comforts me to know that I'm not the only one. Good luck to you!",
