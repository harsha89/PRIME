It's called Main and Tail and can even be found at Walgreens. It's supposed to make your hair grow. We bought some and for the price and small amount you use...it's great! I initially had curly hair and it came back real frizzy and extra curly. This shampoo is making a big difference on both ends. Here's some reviews on the product:: http://www.makeupalley.com/product/showreview.asp/ItemId=70234/Mane_n_Tail_Shampoo/0/Shampoo",

I've got another week to find out the results. It can take up to two weeks. My onc believes the skin mets happened because the Tamoxifen failed. Thats why I'm on Arimidex now. No other cancer as far as the CTscan goes. I am going to have a PET scan soon. Maybe that will give a more definitive picture. Hopefully you just have a spider bite!",

I'm still waiting for the complete biopsy reports to see if the Her neu has changed. There is a 30% chance that it can and if it did I think from my understanding chemo will be involved. Even though the bone scans have been fine, these new lumps have changed my protocol. No more Tamoxifen. I now get a shot to shut my ovaries down and take Arimidex. I had to have a hormone test first to establish if I'm still premenopausal. I'm perimenopausal.  When I saw the breast surgeon she did an ultra sound and a biopsy. I thought to myself...why an ultra sound? Then my onc asked why an ultra sound. From now on, I'm opening my mouth about these tests as I don't think the ultra sound was necessary. Not only that but I think an occasional CT or MRI or PET should be done on the body instead of JUST bone scans as a means to see if hormonals are working. It is my opinion that these are more in depth tests that would of diagnosed the situation sooner....rather than later.",

You're correct that I was on hormonals and the bone scans were coming back on a positive note. A CT scan was ordered . The craziest thing showed up on the CT scan.....one of my lymph nodes markedly shrunk. I already know the ER, PR is still positive, it's the HER part that hasn't come in yet. Pretty sure if that changes to HER positive, it will be chemo . If they want to do an ultra sound on you, ask them why as I don't see the necessity in that one. I'm not saying I'm right about that one so make sure you ask and decide for your self. A penny saved is a penny earned.",
