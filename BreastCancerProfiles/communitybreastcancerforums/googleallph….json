There are pharmeceutical sites that will give you more info than you want with their use of unintepreted medical terms.  But much of it is easy enough to understand and the rashes, blisters and burning were possible side effects, from my reading between the lines, due to an allergic reaction.  Some sites suggested contacting doctor as soon as possible to get something different, maybe non-sulfa, and stopping use if reaction very bad (I think skin starting to blister and fall off might qualify.)  Long term use of Silvadene or the other sulfa ointment was not recommended, reactions occured more often (though not usual) when large areas of skin were covered. Google it.  If medicaid does not cover it, try A&D ointment after saline wash as suggested by others.  Smaller breaks in skin are usually like breaks in a baby's bottom with bad diaper wash.  Wash very gently and well with cool water and apply ointment gently.  If very bad, use zinc ointment which is cheap and found in any drugstore and is anti-bacterial. Blessings on all of you who share.  It is uplifting and helpful to anyone who follow the chain of emails.",
