I had been looking for pictures to see how other women's hair grew back in. I haven't found many so I am very happy to have found yours.",

I have looked for photos of others hair regrowth but couldn't find any so thought it would be nice to do it. I can't be the only one wanting to see what progress to expect. I am about 12 weeks out from my last treatment and am still very thin on top but the sides are beginning to thicken. The thickening is working from above my ears and going up. My eye brows are coming back in for the 3rd time and my lashes are coming in SLOWLY too.",
