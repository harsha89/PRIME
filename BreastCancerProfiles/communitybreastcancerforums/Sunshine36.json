Ended up having sinus infection (thankfully nothing more serious after endless amounts of blood draws, urines, chest xray, etc). And I developed the most aweful mouth sores. In my mouth and throat and it super  sucks :( got a script for \"magic mouthwash\" that is a lidocaine mixed rinse I can do 4x a day. It completley number mouth and throat but only lasts a short time. Other than that just salt water rinsed throughout the day and waiting for them to heal.  antibiotic for the sinuses and tylenol has been taking the edge off for sure. I had a super sad cry fest today - the emotions got the best of me and I just couldn't stop. In the end, it felt good to just have a good cry.  Next round is may1st - just gotta get myself better and the wbc counts good.  Happy easter everyone :-) (sorry for the vent - its been a long weekend)",

A few months ago I was so excited at all the things id be feeling approaching my last round, but now, knowing only 2 rounds left (then my bilateral m 8/20) has me scared sh*tless.  Did I do enough? Wil it really be all gone ? Will I ever feel normal? What if it comes back ? How do i stay positive and enjoy life if im worrying every moment of reoccurrurance :( I know the first few years are scariest and most worrisome, im trying to find the balance of being realistic and being optimistic.  A cancer diagnosis pulls the rug from underneath us, and I fear ill never get my \"innocence/ignorance is bliss\" back. Anyone have any advice on getting that aweful little voice out of your head? I really want to celebrate when my chemo is and my surgery is done - true celebration, not a smile hiding fear!!!!!  I've decided to start working out again too, in hopes to shake this funk a bit.  Ive alwayd been a runner and very active person, cancer and chemo really took my mojo away, but I think some summer sweat endorphins should help! My MO said I could completley start running again as long as im sensible and safe, but I may just try some good ole' power walks in the evenings and wknd mornings while the hubs and kids are snoozing :-) Ps sorry for the mini vent. This last round really put me down in the dumps!!!!! Ps - hoping everyone an easy se-free enjoyable day!  Xoxo jen ",

Alittle bit of jaw pain too. Which completley scares the hell out of me. No fever at all (thankfully) and its not my teeth at all. Its my inner cheeks and gums were the sores and redness were ; ( Called the mo this mornjng and just waiting to hear back. Im just freaked out by the swelling and alittle emotionally beaten down as I thought I was in the clear after round 4, but this is by far the worst bout of mouth sores ive experienced  ; ( I did ice my mouth during infusion, but not as well as I should have I guess ; ( I won't complain any more as I know there are some experiencing far worse than me.  Hugs to all Jen ",

I've had 4 fills already I'm each te  (I have 325cc in each te!) And am pleasantly  surprised how nice the girls are looking?  Maybe I'm just so used to seeing  the scars that they don't look scary anymore?  Still having herceptin every 3 weeks, and even though it's not really chemo again, it's still very odd when I'm back at the infusion center in the chair! But 30 mins and no more benadryl so it's quick!  My port is still annoying as ever,  always uncomfortable and the skin around it and my port scar is always red and irritated. Has been for months - no matter what lotion or cream I try.  My hair is really coming in - just about a GI Jane, but a few spots where it's still scalp but I think will be more even soon. I'm 11 weeks post final chemo so I feel like the growth is finally gaining some momentum! My brows are actually great, they began growing back the quickest,  but lashes are taking their sweet Ole time growing back. So strange!!  Hope you are all doing and feeling great!!!! Amazing we've all been connected since this thread started in April - it's been one heck of a year ladies.  Ever forward - hope you get those drains out!!!!!

Ive managed the big \"C\" better than last round,  but now im heading into the big \"D\", which frankly I don't know which is worse. And just like last round, tons of sinus drainage and pressure,  which sucks big time. So far, no signs of mouth sores yet (been using my biotene products religiously!!), but last time the sores didn't present until day 6/7.  I just feel beaten down and alittle sad (ok, alot sad) . I'm sad my buzz cut didn't hold up, bald patches everywhere. I do enjoy my hats (havent even tried my wig on yet, I want to be in a good emotionAl place when I try it on), but its hard sometimes to see my baldness.  I know im just having a rough go, and better days are coming (those days before last treatment,  when I was se free- those days were so bright and amazing! !). I just have to remind myself that this too shall pass.  I did play a few rounds of Crazy 8's with my hubby and kids last night, all I wanted to do was sleep but if felt good to rejoin the living for a bit. Im having tons of mommy-guilt these last few days.  Ugh!! Sorry for the rant - im just feeling the chemo blues :-(  Hugs to all ",

It's called My Sweet Survivor Sisters . Just an easy way for us to update our journey and keep in touch!

Not cool!! But happy its over and maybe now it'll cease?! Sharon - good luck girl!! Jaimieh - ugh the metal taste is aweful :( I got it after both round 1 & 2 so I guess I can count on it for all 6 rounds :( the only silver lining for me was that it lasted only about 2 or 3 days. Hope it goes away soon for you!  ps - love the pic!!!!! Football - your commitment to working out is awesome!  I have to get on board with you girl! I feel accomplished when I emoty the dishwasher lol!! Clarrn - so happy you had a great experience at LGFB!!! Im still on the fence?!?! ",

I am absolutely terrified, but honeslty so ready to finally just start. Each day that goes by makes me so much more anxious. My husband had been incredible and I am thankful  my two children are too young to really understand what's going on.

I had round 2 yesterday,  feeljng ok, just tired but started my senna and colace last night to try to be proactive for the aweful constipation I had last round! Hoping it helps!

Painful to talk or eat, evem drinking tiny sips caused me to wince.  The magic mouthwash is great, but only lasts about 15 mins or so for releif. In between,  I used orajel on the sores and it foes help, but now today, as the sores are healing, the inside of my mouth (gums and cheeks) feel like they just went 10 rounds with mike tyson, and my cheek is actually swollen on the right side (visibly swollen on the outside). Alittle bit of jaw pain too. Which completley scares the hell out of me. No fever at all (thankfully) and its not my teeth at all. Its my inner cheeks and gums were the sores and redness were ; ( Called the mo this mornjng and just waiting to hear back. Im just freaked out by the swelling and alittle emotionally beaten down as I thought I was in the clear after round 4, but this is by far the worst bout of mouth sores ive experienced  ; ( I did ice my mouth during infusion, but not as well as I should have I guess ; ( I won't complain any more as I know there are some experiencing far worse than me.  Hugs to all Jen ",

Booo.  Thankfully my excessive eye tearing has stopped!!!!! That was such a pain these last few months!!!!! The twitching seems to have subsided a lot too!!! My energy is coming back (been walking 3 miles a day with my friends in the neighborhood!).  So my chemo is over, my BMX is over and I'm healing and feeling better than I imagined I would just 3 wks out from surgery, but tomorrow I have a consult with radiation oncology.  Although my MO and SO both feel I will not need rads, they leave the final decision to the rad onc. So I should find out tomorrow if I'll need more treatments.  I'm pretty nervous.  As of now I'm scheduled to return to work mon!!!  Eeeek.  Although I continued to work ft throughout chemo, I've been off for nearly 4 weeks since my BMX so it feels super nerve wracking to head back feeling this \"altered\"!!!!
