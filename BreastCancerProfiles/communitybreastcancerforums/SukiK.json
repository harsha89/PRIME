I'm going to the Mayo Clinic to meet with a surgeon. I'm scared to death. I'm scared of the biopsy, scared of the diagnosis, and scared of the treatment! Have you had linear microcalifications? What did it turn out to be? Was the biopsy painful? Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

I just found out my 2014 mammogram showed the same calcifications and I was not called back for any diagnostic ones. I think I fell through the cracks. So I've had these tiny linear microcalcifications for two years.",
