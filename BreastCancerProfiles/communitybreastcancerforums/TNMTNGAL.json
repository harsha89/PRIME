I have an appointment with my GP today and im going to ask her to order a nuclear bone scan. This will only be the second time I've seen her because I recently changed drs because my old one didn't seem to be interested in finding out what's going on. My new general practitioner is a lady, who's had a similar situation as mine and actually understands my concerns and is willing to order tests needed to get a specific dx. She just has to do tests in the correct order because of my insurance, but she is very concerned. I will update you on what I find out at my appointment today. My oncologist was the one who ordered the MRI on my breast yesterday but I asked for results to be sent to my new GP today so she can go ahead and give me results because my next appointment with my onco isn't until March. Thank you ladies so very much for your concern, replies, and advice. I truly appreciate it! I'll talk with you later today to let you know what I find out. Prayers much appreciated for what I'm facing",

I've had hard burning pain in my right hip for over a year, and on my iliac crest about 3 months coming and going. I've broken my right arm 4 times and had 5 surgeries on it in 2 years. My surgeon said there's no reason my bones should be that soft even after chemo. They've done MRI's on my spine, my hips and arms. They say they're clear all for degenerative changes. I've had disc removed from my neck. PET scan last year my hip, base of my tongue and pelvis lit up like a Christmas tree. They said it was indicative of a torn psoas muscle. Now my left (side bc was on) upper arm is starting to have bone pain. I go for a bone scan the day after Christmas, on my grandsons birthday. Anyone have bone mets to the hips/pelvis? If so, what did it feel and act like? Was it constant pain, burning, sharp, etc.? *the more I walk the worse it hurts and PT only aggravated it Thank you for your responses! ...WORRIED IN TN",
