Changed hospitals and now going to Dana Farber in Boston. Breast MRI shows another lump in left 1cm. Going for MRI biopsy this week and ultra sound and maybe biopsy of lymph nodes in right armpit.",

I have two tumors in the right breast biggest one being 6cm+ (that's what i was told but on mri shows up at 8.5cm). I get the infusion every three week's and i just had my second one on Friday. Doctor thinks it has halved in size, it does feel a lot smaller and part of it is missing. Hoping it carries on blasting these bc cells away. I just cant believe how effective this treatment is. So i've got two treatments down and four more to go before surgery.",
