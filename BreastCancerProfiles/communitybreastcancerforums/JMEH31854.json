And my onc made it clear at my fist visit in 2009 that the two tumors wouldn't be BC if the pathology report from '98 was accurate. But BC was a good diagnosis as recurrences for bone and lung (my mets sites) are usually around 18-24 months. Alas, my bone scan last Friday showed a new mets on my other femur and I'll be getting rads for the 3rd time. I'm coming to terms that my life will have other \"bumps in the road\" or as my college son called it, \"disconcerting\" events. But God has blessed me over and over and over again, so I know that this recent event will lead to more opportunities to get to know Him better, or that amazing moment when I will see Him face to face. I expect the face-to-face is down the road a ways. I'm also on Zometa and Arimedix. Never took Tamoxifen. Hard to believe I'm at the 13-year mark hand have never lost my hair! Thanks to you both for letting me know I'm not alone.",

      "Content": "Feb 25, 2011 01:43AM - edited Feb 25, 2011 01:45AM by JMEH31854 Thanks for all the comments on this topic. I don't feel alone anymore. My rad onc said that, yes, DCIS to mets may be from a microinvasion that was not caught; but it also may be a new case, that isn't caught when it's still in the chest wall. He stressed that knowing exactly what happened is less important than making good treatment decisions with what we do know to improve my quality of life and length of life. In 1998, there wasn't a protocol for radiation treatment for DCIS with dirty margins. My rad onc called two doctors out East. One didn't irradiate and had seen DCIS come back in the chest wall. The other did irradiate and hadn't seen it come back. Because of these reports, I did get radiation. I'm glad there are now protocols in place to treat dirty margins. I was fighting for radiation when I had no health insurance. Knowing that <10% of those of us who are diagnosed with DCIS will go directly to Stage IV is comforting, especially considering 1 in 8 women get BC. Let's face it, fixing a car is a more exacting science than medicine! While I took the fast train to Stage IV, I also skipped the treatments for Stages I-III. Each recurrence is a reminder that my life is not my own and an opportunity to recheck that I'm living my life to glorify the One who created me. Life is very good!",

I had 11 uneventful years. And I think of my friend's mom who was diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer and died exactly one month later. It seems like BC is not the worst news in the world considering the many treatment options and length of survival for many of us. Not to say it doesn't have it's hard moments or that some are not as fortunate, but many cancers indicate a much shorter length of life (on average). Every day is a day to rejoice and celebrate life!",
