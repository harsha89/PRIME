DawnEllen1, Nico1012, and JulieH: Thanks for being concerned about my heartburn, I have been taking Pepcid, which seemed to work at first, but not anymore.  I will look into Prilosec and/or Prevacid. Thanks. ScienceGirl: I am rinsing my mouth with just a baking soda and water mix, faithfully four times a day and haven't gotten any sores in my mouth.  I am really worried about those for some reason. I feel them start to come on, just as others have said, but they never break the skin and then they go away. Now I'm just getting anxious about losing my hair, I have hats, scarves and a wig ready, just almost to the point of, okay, if your going to fall out, lets get on with it. I have an appointment next week to get my hair cut short, it's kind of long now, I'm going to tell my hair dresser to do what ever she wants.  I figure if I don't like it, I start wearing the hats sooner. Hope everyone has a nice evening, Sue",

I'm a bit nervous about starting the FAC, since Taxol is supposed to be easier (if you can ever call chemo easy.) I thought I would share my experience on Taxol for those of you about to start it, keep in mind, mine is weekly, which might make a difference.  I lost my hair at two weeks, but I have kept my eye lashes and eye brows, although, I can tell that they have thinned.  I had problems immediately with acid reflux, but a daily Prilosec has completely solved that problem. I get bone pain, but usually not so bad that I have to take anything for it.  Absolutely no nausea on Taxol for me. I don't even take anything to prevent it. My toe nails have been a big issue for me, they hurt and I can't wear anything that touches them so I have had to give up my running routine, which has been really hard for me, and since I don't have nausea and can't run, I am putting on weight.  I keep telling myself that I can get it off later.  I do walk almost everyday at the high school track, in flip flops, thank God for the warmer weather. My fingernails have started giving me problems, they throb and are turning dark underneath.  I've had to take some pain meds for that a few times to get to sleep.  I'm also in the 10% that get Taxol rash, which looks like a really bad sunburn on the back of my hands, and it is moving up my arms, it is about to my elbows now.  Nothing the onc has told me to do has helped with that. So, nothing too bad, like I said, getting anxious about the FAC, but ready to get it over with. Take care everyone, Sue",

When I think of it that way, I feel better. I am the primary care giver to our 13 daughter who is paraplegic, and I need to be as healthy as possible, so by being \"selfish\" and taking care of my self, I am actually being selfless. Anyway, that's how I think of it.

I had my second infusion (Taxol) yesterday, also had a power port put in yesterday too.  I'm tolerating things well so far, mainly dealing with a lot of heartburn, which explains why I am up at 12:30am.  I feel I guess as prepared as a person can be for this because I have read so much on this message board over the last couple of months, everyone is so willing to share and help each other, so I thought I should join in.  Sue",
