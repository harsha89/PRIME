Everything I am reading, breastcancer.org, mayoclinic.com, etc are all saying, most common in younger women. I am 59 yrs of age. They want me to wait 6 months for another ultrasound to see if there is growth. Should I be worried since I am not young, do not have my periods any longer, not child bearing age, etc. Should I go for a second opinion?",

I know there are certain words I need to be aware of, asymmetry or mass with measurable dimensions. I believe the radiologist said it was 8cm. right now. Thank you for responding.",
