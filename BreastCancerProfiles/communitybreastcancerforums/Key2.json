With my IBC my breast was red warm to the touch on top and had the orange peel under the breast...just breath don't think the worst and get the memo or MRI and take it from there as I did! I am telling you this because I thought that I had IBC on my other breast because I had a redness and pain that would not go away so I went to see the breast surgeon he looked at it and thought it was not IBC however did a biopsy and confirmed it was dermatitis!!! It itched it hurt and since I had IBC on my other breast I thought it had to be the same it was NOT!! So wait for your appointment think positive (which I know is hard to do) but until you know you don't know! Big Hug to you and keep us posted. Ki",

We have a tread going on Afinitor/Aromasin 2013 if you ever have questions.. Here are some pointers others have found on Afinitor MOUTH SORES - Hoping your doctor prescribed a mouth wash for you use 3 times a day to keep the mouth sores away. Plus use whipping cream when you take the Afinitor pill followed by water. It really will help not getting any mouth sores. Stay positive and fight on! Kim",

I notice my joints hurting taking LETROZOLE by itself (which is a noted side effect) Started my 2nd round of both drugs again a week ago and my symptoms of joints hurting have gone away about 75% again, so I feel that the IBANCE definitely effects something with the joints and the pain going away when I'm on both drugs together..Not sure why but for me it does.
