I've not met with my surgeon yet so I'm just guessing I won't have a masectomy from the little information I have now. I also assume that I'll have some lymph nodes removed and checked. I'm just full of questions, most can't be answered yet. Dx 12/28/2009, IDC, 3cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 2, 4/10 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
