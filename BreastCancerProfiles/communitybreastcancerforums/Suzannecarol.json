At first I thought it was because of the tube they put down your throat but it has gotten worse each day. Today it is bad enough that I am going to call my regular doctor tomorrow morning if not better. This morning it woke me up at 5 and I could not go back to sleep. I took a Hydrocodone tablet 3 hours ago and it has not helped any more than Tylenol. I usually tolerate pain fairly well. The lumpectomy did not bother me this much at all. Has anyone else had this pain? Thanks for your time. Surgery was March 18th Dx 2/13/2015, DCIS, <1cm, Stage 0, 0/0 nodes, ER+, HER2- Surgery 3/18/2015 Lumpectomy: Left, Right Log in to post a reply",
