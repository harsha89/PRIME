For every decent human being alive to wish this man ALL the pain shame and humiliation he puts me through for loving my husband and children and begging every day just to hear them say that to me too instead of calling me a liar and denying I love them every time I get to say it. Even my therapist is at a loss for words on this one because he knows it's just not in me to give up on them. I'm hoping a little karmic justice and social outrage will be enough to restore my faith in life enough to continue to fight for it. I know that's mean and selfish of me but I can't help how powerful the feeling is, even if I know I am a better person than that. My husband used to be, until he was convinced he could get away with this, and so far he HAS. I'm terrified of the holidays so I am just taking it one day at a time for now. Shenanigans I am really glad you are doing so well after surgery I am so happy for you! You hug your loving man and tell him it's nice to know they still exist and knowing he takes care of you better than mine ever will makes me so happy for you both and helps me remember what it was like to feel loved by my husband too before he became a monster when I had to leave to get treatment. How vile of a man can convince his own children that their mother does not love them and abandoned them so how they treat me is totally fine because I deserve bullying instead of mercy or emotional support. I'm the one who is sick and still don't deserve any apology or to EVER come first to them. I am ashamed of them claiming to be better off without me, and can't wait to show up as soon as I am healthy enough to surprise them all someday.",

I am now a teaching case for the procedure and it looks like we got almost total response to chemotherapy but still awaiting reports from pathology and genetics as requests are pouring in for data or even a quick peek but I'm wrapped very well and that stays put until next week when surgeon shows me where we went with placement of scars and drains. My pain was managed very well and we had the best response to the whole skin saving process also and that makes me happier than I have been since I was first diagnosed! My mom and brother took me in and saw to every detail for me so I could heal and not stress anymore after my husband was being a total selfish jerk for the holidays I wasted down to 115 because I was made to cry so hard I threw up one time too many! I had my hopes raised and crushed between weeks of silence and demanding texts but not a single pic of our kids Christmas, New Years or sons birthday. I'm getting more emails from teachers saying my freshmans grades are falling and she's skipping school with her driving sister now too! No wonder nobody wants to talk to me these days now that the cat is out of the bag! I am so well loved from the rest of my family and friends surrounding me with prayers and best wishes for a speedy recovery it keeps me hopeful for my future one day at a time!",

I am using a lydocane 5% adhesive patch for bruised ribs good for 12 hrs per patch and it really helps unlock the muscles and nerves to speed healing and avoid breakthrough pain. I've also heard from Fox News that there is a new post reconstruction bra in the testing phase with a heat feature like an electric blanket instead of traditional cold therapy like gel packs that is not working as well as projected in recovery results. I know they had a link for the survey to qualify for it under health news. They are looking for 45 and up recently reconstructed double mastectomy. I'm a tad below the age line on that but am a size d to start with so I'm waiting to hear back if I can join the study or not. Meanwhile I highly recommend using palmers skin therapy oil. It's argon oil so it will make you sun sensitive but utterly remarkable results over plain baby oil! I have used this for years on stretch marks for pregnancy and weight loss and it is the best way for me to feel comfortable in my own skin as my body goes nuts temporarily! I've always gone for gradual heat therapy for surgery recovery and found that I heal much faster and scar less keeping oil on with loose gauze for bed. Hope that helps you, and best of luck with surgery",

I have been facing this issue since I was diagnosed in June and I came to stay with my mom and use the same team of doctors that cured her several years earlier. She is a 3 time survivor or colon breast and skin cancer so I can't imagine anyone better to teach me how to survive this! My husband and 3 teenagers were not at all supportive because they viewed me choosing to use her doctors and not stay at home as complete abandonment and refuse to speak to me now. I struggled so hard to attain my diagnosis because I always put myself last and kept up the insanity of a part time job, schools their schedules doctor visits for 4 an absentee husband emotionally and me getting weaker by the day as I am called lazy, crazy, selfish drama queen for not being as strong as they wish me to be. We all knew I was sick, and ptsd aside it was my biggest shock after I found out and told them I had breast cancer and my kids called me a liar! They could not believe that it was true and refused to see me or hug me goodbye because they said I did not deserve that for abandoning them during diagnostics I kept away from my phone for a few weeks because I had bit of a setback and had to focus on myself only and I have never done that before so I understand they are upset and looking to control their circumstances but I have raised them better than that! It was my worst nightmare to watch this all unfold in may because I was completely unable to acquire the level of professional qualified care needed to cure me at home! I live in the worst state on the planet for needing state services of ANY kind and one of the most crowded expensive states in the country just raised gas tax 23c a gallon this year instead of raising minimum wage as promised! Instead they took the tax increase fund from children education program and turned it into a universal slush fund for fixing our state road and bridges! Nj is the ONLY state you are grateful to pay 5 bucks to get out the only bridges left standing! Financially there was no way for our family to withstand the impact of me and my husband out of work only he gets disability on top of extra travel and copay fees we could never afford to get to treatment that I cannot afford to miss and not die! There are no quality mental health programs in place that take any insurance at all, and the few that do are overcrowded and booking over 6 months out for first appointment because the state wants to shove everyone through a battered emergency room straight to a minimum 30 day lockdown facility focused on addiction treatment instead of mental health treatment for ptsd. It's one big body farm with a revolving door and I've been misdiagnosed and lied to for profit enough thanks! So I did the only thing I could and came out to stay with mom and my brother who takes care of her since we lost dad to colon cancer. I can't tell you how many members of our family have or have had cancer recently in our genetics report as we all add to it that has blessed us with greater understanding and love to heal better together through the same cancer center with that we are learning about each other. I do not look forward to the day I hand this down to my kids but it is worth so much more than every tear I cried to accomplish that. One day they will understand and until that day comes I already forgive them. I am unable to not try to talk to them because of my separation anxiety but I just text once in a while and don't expect to hear anything back. It is entirely possible to love someone and not like them or what they choose to do. I sent a picture of myself doing treatment all bald to prove I'm not out partying and telling the truth about my time away and my son told me to Rest In Peace. Not a chance little man! Of all the family who has had cancer, it's not what most of them died from! It's treatable only if you face it! My biggest mistake was thinking that once the image made it real for them that this is true and I cannot control it that they would have mercy on me and all would be forgiven in time for us to make things right for all of us finally. That is what I will keep praying for anyway. I really counted on my husband to have my back on this and let's just say he doesn't! It's unite against the common enemy so I get to be cool instead of a responsible parent trick. See I'm NOT their friend, I'm their MOM! I look forward to the day we get to be friends as adults but that is decades away from now!! He had to step up and fill my shoes on the front lines and that was me abandoning him. Funny how it wasn't him abandoning me when I had no help at all when he was at work or \"out\" when we were up to 3 kids and down to one car. He still got off light in my opinion because teenagers can be bribed to do chores instead of trying to change diapers for 3 kids getting in to everything constantly! I'd give my life for any one of them to this day because my love for them is unconditional. That does NOT mean I should have to in order to be deemed worthy of their love and support! The shame of knowing that is what fuels their silent rage, and while I do forgive them for what they are feeling but I will not be made to believe it is acceptable or tolerate any abuse of my condition from them. I dread the holidays more than you can imagine, filled with birthdays to boot so I am hanging in and laying low for my last 5 treatments then double mastectomy and reconstruction about 7 weeks out of all goes well scheduling teams to work together. Thank you all for letting me share with you, it helps me so much I hope you can find a ray or two of hope in there also! Good luck to us all",

I am having 16 treatments then a double mastectomy and reconstruction around January so that is not a lot of time to vet a plastic surgeon and add to my team. I just found out I am estrogen positive braca 2 her negative. I had my suspicions but now it's fact so I can plan ahead for future risks to additional organs. Wasn't prepared to talk about giving up more organs at a genetics meeting so I gave the indignant woman what for and walked out! My ovaries and uturous are healthy and cancer free according to my pet scan so it's important to stay on top of your charts I have found. Blaming my mother for not getting tested after her cancer was one step too far for all of us. I have posted a few things on combined diagnosis threads because I have had ptsd for over a decade and was medication and alcohol free for 10 months before diagnosis and am currently working with a ptsd specialist in therapy. I found this critical to me to process my emotions and respond appropriately in even the worst situations. I have learned that there are a lot of doctors that don't take the time to explain their decisions... and you have every right to force the issue by asking questions and expecting a response you understand. Don't be shy! I hope that helps I keep notes on my treatment papers of who explained which subject so I can check another source if information is questionable. You all inspire me to stay strong and keep fighting this! Doctors are people too, and people make mistakes so there is no harm in asking how you can help keep track of things too",

I had visible confirmation from all treating me that my condition was in weekly decline despite clearing 3 chest X-rays for treatments and basically told to suck it up it wasn't that bad! I decided to give them all a dose of their own medicine on patient pain shaming from the proper perspective! If me asking to be relieved of the pain the treatments have clearly placed me in makes me a drug seeking junkie then what do you call the people you pay to treat you that caused the pain then refuse to part with the medication that treats it properly? Disgraceful! My entire team now is keenly aware that I don't take to character assasination lightly and have as much fight as nessicary to employ their same tactics with much worse implications on their character than mine on the issue! I have an addiction specialist on my therapy team that finds this all hilarious! The fact that I did not leave a trail of bodies behind that day is true testimony to his level of professional skill! I got to be the karmic kick in the pants that keeps the illusion of superiority in check for everyone working FOR me to cure my cancer. I don't care what you think of me personally as long as you do your job properly, I'm not here to be judged by anyone aside from the Lord that made me! Stay strong and rock on",

I was diagnosed in June with the same very nasty estrogen positive her2 negative braca 2 invasive ductal carcinoma that has plagued my mothers family for generations. I was the one that made the diagnosis official for my mother (who had identical type cancer stage 2b 3 years ago!!) and I was a stage 3c when my general physician found cancer!! so NOW insurance company will pay for the rest of our relatives to get their tests as soon as possible to track our unidentified mutation of braca 2. They can't tell us what it is let alone what it does so no clue what it means to the bigger picture of genetics in general or our specific family. I had full palatable mass reduction on all 4 tumors but a 4.5 cm tumor in my armpit that started out the size of a golf ball, only the tiny flat pin can be felt now where it was. Lymphs are a little harder to tell but I was supposed to loose 5 and it may be less now but won't know until after surgery and reconstruction january 9. I had a phenomenal response to the first set of 4 more aggressive chemo with the nuclear push every 2 weeks. My numbers all looked like I was not on treatment at all until The weekly treatments of taxol really wiped the floor with me by about the 5th treatment on, and side effects were SO much worse than first kind that I begged them to switch back! That was most surprising to my oncology team that all my numbers looked so great but I was feeling so awful I was ready to quit treatments to run away and hide! I also have had ptsd for over a decade so I'm a little harder to treat when I am very hurt or sick so we had a therapist ready to see me before and during chemo to help everyone on my teams understand my special needs during treatments. I could never have made it through that without my mom by my side with the same team of doctors that cured her! The one thing that surprised us all the most was the fact that the same cancer that hit my mom in her late 60s struck me at 41! The part that started turning heads is that 2 other cousin branches of moms side had 3 similar active cases NOW ages 40-51! People are starting to ask where we went to the beach most often as a family and the implications of that in my state are too disturbing to deal with right now but nice to see that it is under investigation finally! I was so blessed to find one of the top centers in the country for the type of cancer we have, and they got me through diagnostics and started treatments in record time which kept me from becoming a stage 4 in a matter of weeks! My doctor was on the phone with me in less than an hour after my test to tell me it was all still encapsulated and not in any bones so we were both sincerely happy at the words it's ONLY stage 3 breast cancer! I hope getting tested early will spare my teenage daughters that experience. Since I am a boba fide mutant I don't get to do any kind of trials for chemo but I am doing skin saving nipple saving double mastectomy... they've got an option to bank nipples by my c-section under belly fat for second surgery if tissue is viable! If not they can make replacements from other skin anywhere I can spare it! Wish me luck everyone and I will be back to let you know how it went! Happy holidays and best wishes and comfort to all of you for helping me to be brave enough to talk about my journey",
