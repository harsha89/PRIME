These 3comments months have been the longest/shortest months ever... feels like it took forever for her to get fully diagnosed... but on the other hand I feel like our lives changed so fast. I'm hoping and praying that the radiation and hormone therapy works because I can't imagine life without my mom. I live 3 hours from herand I have become the 1 in charge of everything. I hate this disease and feel helpless....i wish i could do something to make her better. I am angry and sad and depressed and scared ...... scared that her body will give out and I will lose her.",
