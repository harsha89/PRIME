It does help to read how others have made their decision. I didn't have choice of lumpectomy or mx on the diseased breast. I didn't have a lump and the area of dcis was too extensive, there wouldn't have been anything left. The choice I did have was whether or not to lose the 'healthy' one also. I chose a bmx with tissues expanders for several reasons. I had an MRI after the biopsy revealed that I did indeed have ca.That showed some suspicous areas in the other breast and another biopsy was recommended. They also did an ultrasound and would have done the biopsy right then but I said no. As I was lying there crying it was then that I decided to have the bmx. I spoke to my bs and she understood. I couldn't live the rest of my life never knowing when I was going to go through this again. I was now at greater risk and no matter what the statisics showed,, any risk was too much for me. I also knew that reconstuction would be easier as it's hard to match a foob to a natural. That wasn't the reason but bebing only 40 I want to try and be as normal as possible. I don't regret my decision at all. The final pathology report showed alot of activity in the healthy breast. I most likely would have issues in the future. My bs considers me cancer free and cured. It is a very personal decisions. Weigh all of your options. No choice is easy but if you are well informed it will come to you.Best wishes.",

I don't start fills for 3 weeks. My ps has cleared me to return. I'm on my last few days of a 10lb lifting restriction. Everyone heals differently and every ps/bs is different and has different protocols they follow so it's hard to say when you'll be ready to return. Your body will tell you too. As someone mentioned, the whole process takes a lot out of you. I was exhausted very easily for the first 2 weeks. My drains came out then and I gradually started doing a little more each day. My ps even said I could get on the treadmill as long as I didn't go over 2.5mph. As far as what to wear, my ps was very specific. My insicions were covered with gauze for the first 2 weeks and I wore a compression/bra/girdle type thing that they put me in after surgery. I wore that for 2 weeks, day and night. The only part I found uncomfortable was that it was long and kind of squeezed me in. I didn't and don't have any feeling where my breasts used to be. When my ps said I could stop wearing the girdle thing he said anything else was fine just not tight and no underwire. I bought a few sports bras that are bigger than what I would normally wear that hook in the front. They have been very comfortable. Would it be awkward for you, your co-workers looking at your chest? If so, wear something loose or even layers. When I have a shirt on and a hoodie or sweater over, you really can't tell there isn't much on the chest. I have what I call boobumps, not really boobs but more that bumps. For me though, I don't give a hoot what others think when they look at me. I am not defined by my breast size and no one should criticize that which they've never experienced. Good luck to you and best wishes.",

My cording issues were back in Jan/Feb and I did a few weeks of physical therapy that took care of it. I was also fitted for a sleeve that I never wore, until now. I'm not quite sure what's going on but my snb arm just doesn't feel right. I don't feel any pain but it feels heavy and even a bit swollen. Visually I don't see a difference. So, I started wearing my sleeve when I workout and hope it passes. I have an appointment with my bs in Jan but if it gets worse I will definitely be calling sooner. I'd be concerned about the redness too. Definitely get it checked out. Interesting how so many are told they are low risk for LE yet still get it. Maybe they need to rethink that.",

The number of nodes in each level varies from person to person\". Levels are low axillary which is right in the armpit and down the lateral side of the breast/chest, mid axillary which starts to move towards the shoulder joint and high axillary which is kind of under the clavicle. The sentinel node is the first node or nodes that receive lymphatic fluid from the tumor, identifying the drainage pattern and the node most likely to be cancerous. Sentinel nodes are like the gatekeepers to the rest of the lymph nodes. Good luck with the healing and try not to stress too much about LE.

To be honest, I don't remember exactly. Wow, could it mean that all of this bs is fading from my memories? I guess so, as much as it can. Good luck to those with exchange dates soon.

I mean just got back, he finished up about and hour or so ago and I'm in my hotel room. Words alone can't say how much appreciation I have for the work he does. We are extremely fortunate to have someone with his talent and compassion. His assistant Richie is great. Everyone at the shop was friendly yet professional. I was completely at ease and from the get go had no doubt that I made the right decision. The result is amazing. While he was working on one side I was facing a mirror and happened to look up at my reflection. I couldn't believe my eyes. I wanted to reach up and tweak my new nipple! Or at least what I though was one. The entire process took a couple of hours, had bilateral done. I did have some discomfort but nothing that was horrible. I asked about that and he said everyone is different and the type of recon you have can affect what you feel. Still worth it in my book. The discomfort was nothing compared to the bmx. I feel done with this process. Complete and whole again. These weren't the tattoos I always talked about getting, but I don't think there is another tattoo that could ever make me feel as whole as these do. Haven't had a chance to read the most recent posts. Hope all are doing well. Be well.",

I don't want to be a nelly but I don't want to ignore something that could more than just a normal ache or pain related to age, exercise, etc. Does this make sense? I don't want to be complacent but don't want to go overboard either. I guess I'm just worried that other than my yearly visits with my pcp and my once a year with my BS I have no other followup.

She said that lyphadema is not common with SNB. The 'sentinel node' is the first node that drains the tumor. In order to find it, they inject a radioactive substance that's carried by the lymph fluid. In surgery they use a gamma-detection probe that detects where the radioactive subs accumulates and this is how they know where to take a sample. Some docs use the blue dye too. My BS nurse said the sample they take out is like a fat pad that can have several nodes. My BS never told me this could happen. Am I mad at her? No. Would it have been nice to know some of the possibilites so that I'm not making trips to the ER when something comes up I'm not expecting? Yes. If my sentinel node had come back positive she would have done a complete axillary dissection. Luckily that wasn't needed.",

Secondly, in my opinion, there really was no point, no pun intended, because I wouldn't feel it anyway. I don't have any sensation around my scars and wouldn't feel a nipple.I like that I don't ever have to wear a bra if I don't want and I'm not trying to cover up the headlights.

According to the mammo, the right breast was 'normal'. My BS wanted an MRI to make sure the right was really ok and to assess the left better. I don't have any family hx of  breast ca and there was concern because of the extensive area in the left. Well, the MRI showed some abnormal uptake in the right. I had an ultrasound of the right and there were a couple areas of suspicion. The radiologist would have done a bx right then but the areas were too small and she didn't want to poke around. Very happy for that! She did recommend a bx under MRI. After talking with my BS, I decided I didn't want another bx, that I would have a bmx. I just had my genetic testing done today and won't know the reults until after surgery. Personally, I couldn't live with the black cloud hanging over my head forever. Never knowing and always wondering if it's coming back.My BS said that provided the lymph nodes come back neg, I won't need chemo, just hormone therapy. Everybody's dx is different and their treatment is different. research, get all the info you can and then go with your gut. As far as getting answers until it's done, I think that is partially true. In my case, I won't know if there is lymph node involvement until surgery but from the MRI my doc doesn't believe there is. She hasn't ordered a PET scan and wouldn't until the final pathology report is available. Talk with your doc. Make a list of all your questions. I did. Like I said, your gut will tell you what the best thing is for you. Positive thoughts and prayers to you!",

His feelings are causing friction I told everyone beforehand that right now everything is about me and that I'm the most important right now. I've said the my parents as well as my partner that they need to put their feelings aside because I need to focus on healing. Just seems that he isn't able to do that. He has always been loving and kind and has been with me every step of the way so far. But now it seems like I need to make a choice between my parents and him. It's a choice I can't and shouldn't have to make and I just don't know what to do. Help....",

I had my first follow-up with my ps today. He said everything looks great. He's pleased at how I'm doing and even happier that the only time I take a pain pill is to sleep at night. My next appointment is Monday and I hope the drains come out then. No shower until the drains come out, wicked bummer. But I consider myself lucky to be doing so well. I find that I get tired pretty easily but seeing that I'm only 5 days post-op that seems normal to me. The only thing I wish was better is getting out of bed. I just can't do it on my own no matter how elevated I keep my chest. Anyone else have this problem? Sometimes I feel like the expanders are going to come out of my eye sockets. I'm just afraid that's the way it is until they come out. Goldlining... I didn't get any instructions like that. Sounds strange but I guess every place is different. My ps had me shower twice a day, starting 3 days prior to surgery, from neck to toe with Hibiclens. No mention was made of my hair only that I could use my regular shampoo, but shampooing wasn't a must as far as I know. I did have to shower the morning of surgery. And I did have a bonnet. Good luck and best wishes to all the upcoming surgeries.",

I was dx about 2 weeks ago with DCIS and an area of invasion in my left breast. I had 2 areas in the one breast bx, both positive for, ER+/PR+, her2-. My surgeon wanted me to have an MRI just to be sure only the left breast was involved. The mammo didn't show anything on the right. Well, there area couple of suspicious areas in the right as well. The radiologist recommended a bx under MR (the suspected area was too small to bx under ultrasound which I also had on Fri.) I spoke with my breast surgeon and have opted for a bilateral mx. I'm only 40 years old and don't want to live the rest of my life with the thought of recurrence hanging over my head. I can understand being concerned about the wait and see. I could opt to do nothing to the right breast as it could potentially be healthy but I'm not personally willing to take the chance that it isn't. A lumpectomy wasn't an option for me as the area involved in the left breast is too large. I would try and get all your ducks in a row before having surgery. Research, get a second opinion and talk with your docs about options. My doc told me that in my case, and because of the extent of involvement, the cancer has been there for years. So, taking some time to research and decide what you want to do shouldn't pose a problem. Doesn't make sense to me to leave an area that is suspicious. What's the doctor's rush? Good luck to you.",

I hated that I couldn't shower and it took me forever to do anything like get dressed. Are you still draining alot? My ps took them out when they got to less than 50cc a day for a couple of days. I haven't had any issues with fluid buildup since they came out. I still move slow for some things. I'm still afraid of screwing something up with the te. I still have discomfort in the armpit that had the snb but each day it gets a little better. Keep the faith. Each day will get better. Do you think you should call your doc? How often since surgery do you see him/her? I saw mine twice a week for the first 2 weeks and he was always available if I had questions. Not sure if this helps.

He really is a great guy and for not being a doctor really knows a lot about breast reconstruction. I had all the confidence in the world with his abilities.

I do, however, think of you all often and with positives thoughts and hopes that you are all doing well. You've all been such a source of support during a time and with an issue that no matter how hard they try, others just don't understand. I am doing well and have to say, with some reservation, or maybe it's fear, that I am healthier now than I have been in a long time. I got my head on straight and addressed my weight problem... 46 pounds later I'm almost there. Started running in May, never have before and have run four 5ks so far. I'm looking to train for a half marathon next year, maybe. We'll see if my knees hold up. I do have spme shoulder issuese that Ii never had before bmx but I work through it. Other then that, I'm just thankful for every day. My mind still wanders. With my job, I'm a CT tech,I see things that make me uneasy. But I redirect and move on. Hope all are well and continue to stay that way. Thanks again for being there. Remember, I may not visit hear too often, but you all are in my thoughts and prayers.",

My instructions were that I should wear something for support, no underwire and nothing tight and don't need to at night. Do you find that when you get out of bed the te's are really uncomfortable? I keep my chest and head elevated, not ready to lay flat, and still when I get up I feel this tremendous pressure. It's almost like they have shifted and are moving back to where they belong.

I've read a little on here about cording and aws and the description sounds just like how it feels. It's not a constant pain though and seems to be worse after I get off the treadmill. Weird.

I still worry that I'm not doing enough. I even mentioned having my ovaries removed and she thought that was a bad idea. She feels that it's important to have the body function as normally as possible. That early menopause wouldn't help me. I have contemplatef a second opinion.

I figure if I can go back to work without restrictions I can work on losing weight. I've always thought of Weight Watchers but have found a program very similar that is free. It's called my fitness pal.com. They have apps for IPads and I Phones and I think yo can do it online. It's great. You plug in your info, log your food intake and exercise.

My originals were always small for the rest of my body and I figured I deserved something out of all this ugliness. He took in 3 different sizes at surgery and I was very clear that the bigger, the better. I could only go so big because I didn't have enoug skin to go huge. 700's sounds gigantic but they aren't. I don't see a huge difference from my originals, just sitting up a bit higher really. I'm a C/D cup depending on brand.

Everyone heals differently and I don't think we can ever be truly prepared for what we go through, Informed yes but knowing exactly how it's all going to go, no. I'm lucky in that i didn't really need pain meds after the first week. Drains came out after 2 weeks and wer putting out less than 50cc in a 24 hour period for 2 days. Every ps and bs has different protocols and expectations and I think that may be why some seem to be further along than others. My bs said I'd be out 4-6 weeks. The ps said 2-4 depending on my course and how I was doing. He was very specific as to what I could and couldn't do. The first time I saw him after surgery I asked him what I should do as far as moving my arms etc, because I didn't want to screw up the work he had just done. He said the more I moved the better I'd be. I wasn't to lift my arms higher than shoulder level for the first week. Then he turned to my loved ones and said they would feel the need to baby me and do everything for me. He told them not to. The best thing was for me to start doing things for myself. He is all about attitude and independence and I think it helped. Of course I didn't overdo, although my family thought I did. I just had the mindset that I need to do certain things at some point and the sooner I'm healed the better of I'll be. It will get better. We'll all heal physically and emotionally. It just may be at different times. It's important to remember that not every person and their surgeries are the same. I still get tired easily. I really don't like these tissue expanders and don't think I'll ever get used to them. I have shooting pains that course through where my breasts used to be. But, what am I gonna do?

I have no regrets whatsoever with my decision to have a bmx. eve...good to hear things re turning around for you. Hope all are doing well. I had my first fill yesterday.It really was ok. My ps is funny, I asked him how much we were doing, he said it depended on how much I could handle. He was very good about asking if I was feeling pain or any discomfort. Ended up with about 470cc's in each! The expanders actually feel better now that they are inflated. He also said I'm at about my pre-surgery volume. I was suprised at that. Sometimes when I look they look huge, other times not so sure. I think it's that they are just sitting up higher. So, it's up to me as to whether I want to go bigger. We'll see. happy healing to all.",

You have more important things to think about, getting well. I'm pretty lucky so far, my workplace has been very supportive. I'm wondering though how long it will last. I work in healthcare, 3rd shift, by myself. For my supervisor to cover my shift when I'm gone is sometimes like moving mountains. But, you know what, that's his issue to deal with, I have my own. And of course I was scheduled to work Christmas and New Year's which makes it even harder. Everyone has chipped in and my shifts are covered, not that it would have mattered to me if they weren't. My colleagues are being great and I hope it continues on this crazy journey. Good wishes to you and try not to worry about work!",

It's so strange because when I'm washing the incisions I feel pressure but a numbness too. Does that make sense? I think if you are concerned you should give your ps a call. They are here to help us through this. Very strange as I was told,at least I think I was that I wouldn't have any sensation in my breasts. Maybe it's phantom sensations.",
