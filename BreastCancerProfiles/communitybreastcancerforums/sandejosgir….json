I am almost done with my Chemo, started May 24th, 4xAC, and weekly Taxolx6, just 2 left.  Taylor, unfortunately kids do get used to chemo! I have a 7, turning 6 in Sept, 3.5 and 10 month old.  It sucks, but we are surviving. I think once we \"settled\" in to Chemo and got a routine, however sucky, it helped my kids feel \"normal\".  A new cancer normal. ~Stephanie",

I kinda felt like I didn't belong 'cause I started Chemo in May and just had my last today. Wanted to post for Michaela: I did dose dense ACx4 and weekly Taxol x8.  When I was on the AC I felt AWFUL and had a really hard time sleeping. You'd think with feeling so bad that I would be able to sleep at night, but I had a hard time going to sleep and if I woke in the middle of the night, had a hard time getting back to sleep.  Just wanted to let you know that it passed about two weeks after I moved on to just Taxol.  I dont' know if it was just getting \"used\" to my dx or treatment or if it was not being on the AC, but I do sleep much better now. I would take Ativan and melatonin. Helped a lot. Peace, Stephanie",
