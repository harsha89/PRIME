I'm 34 years old, married for 9 years, and have 3 children - two boys that are 7 and 5 yrs old and our daughter who is 8 months. I don't have many details yet, except I have DCIS. Because of the size (8.cm) it will most likely require I have a mastectomy. My head is definitely spinning and I'm trying to figure out where to start. I stay at home with the kiddos and the past week has been hard to handle... just the stress of not knowing. I'm not sure how the next 6+ months are going to play out and I'm terrified.... terrified for myself, but mostly for my husband and kids. Would love to hear any advice or suggestions on how others got through the tough months. I'm so happy that I found this forum and look forward to meeting everyone. Mel",
