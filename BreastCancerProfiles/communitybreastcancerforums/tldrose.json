I have been given alot of anti-nausea pre meds and haven't had any problems with that. I did react badly to the Neulasta and told my Onc that I wanted a round without it to see what my body does and I feel much better this time. I do have to go get my CBC done tomorrow and am praying they are good so I don't need the Neulastat on the the next round! After AC next week, I will start 4 rounds of Taxol and not sure how that will be!",
