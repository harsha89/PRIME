Not an easy decision..but the MO called it somewhat of an insurance plan. According to her it was on the move. Sometimes I have second thoughts about the decision..but overall, I think I have more piece of mind having done everything.",

Both of those in the beginning stages can turn your hair orange. Look for color with an A For ash..it's fine if its an AR also. Ash cuts the red and doesn't let it surface. Permanent colors strip...then put color in. This is not the best on newer hair. Temp colors deposit pigment only and are safer and actually more effective on anything still white or gray. Temp will let you pick your future color and can be done freely since there is nothing harsh in it. I started with Loreal Paris Healthy Look creme gloss - I started with 4AR and it gave it a look like I had cut it that short on purpose because of the color - they have some nice darker colors with the burgundy and violet tones. I gradually stepped down in color as my hair came in and I didn't need it as dark. I still use it after trying a million brands and occasionally will have the hairdresser throw highlites in. The highlites areas always stay lighter so I can use the temp color whenever it needs a touch up. Eventually when your hair is in for a while the reds and golds will end up as they should but in the beginning be careful..more so if its a permanent color.",

That was different from the last 2 times when they fell out and the new ones were just starting to appear - which made it soooo noticeable.

My 2nd TC is tomorrow morning.  I'm concerned about the neulasta shot just being given indescriminatly. Ok, my understanding is the count needs to stay with 4000 - 10000.   Before Chemo, my count was 11000+  I've always run on the high side all of my life...so this was nothing unusual.  Had the first treatment, neulasta the next day and at day 7 which is supposed to be the low time (correct me if I;m wrong) the count had only dropped to 10.23.  On the 14th day it went to a whopping OVER 30,000.  My red count stayed relatively the same thru-out going from 45 to 42, but my platelets took a nose dive going down about 150 pts.  Does anyone have their actual numbers?  I am alittle disturbed that the white count would be booted to that extreme.  I'm wondering if I even need it and certainly don't want a bunch of possible immature/malformed white cells floating around unnecessarily.  I also believe that I read somewhere that the white count can actually kill off platelets if the white is high.  Does anyone have any information on there own counts. Or any experience with this?  I would rather forego the shot after seeing that ridiculous count.???  Thoughts anyone ?
