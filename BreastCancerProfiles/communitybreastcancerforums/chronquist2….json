Have any of you had a chemo that\u2019s worked then taken off it to start a trial and then went back on it and had the same results?",

      "Content": "Apr 2, 2018 05:44PM chronquist22 wrote: Hello all! My mom was diagnosed with Stage IV Triple Negative Breast Cancer in October 2017. Here is her journey so far... She was diagnosed with Stage 2A breast cancer in September 2017. She was to have 8 rounds of chemo and then surgery. The day before going in for chemo, they did a scan to measure the size of the breast tumor. During that scan, they noticed a spot on her liver so they cancelled chemo for the next day to discuss the treatment. One week after learning of the spot on her liver, they did a biopsy of it and confirmed it was cancerous so she was now Stage 2B Breast Cancer. That same week, they did a complete body scan to make sure it hadn't spread anywhere else. They confirmed it hadn't and was just in her breast and liver. They scheduled chemo to target both the breast and liver for the following week. That following week, they did another scan the day before she was to start chemo, to get the exact size of the tumor and spot so they could compare after the 8 rounds of chemo to make sure they had shrunk. That was a Thursday and she was to start chemo the next day, Friday. Friday, they called her and said to come up a few hours early for another scan as they think she has spots on her lungs. Keep in mind, the week before, they did the body scan and said she was clear besides her liver and breast. They did the scan around 11 on that Friday and was to start chemo at 1. The dr brought my mom and dad into his office around noon and said 'Patti, everything has changed. You're lungs are filled with cancer and you are now Stage 4. There's nothing we can do for you and you have less than a year to live. We can try the chemo but it's not going to do anything.\" The doctor got up, shook my dad's hand, and said \"I'm sorry, Rich.\" and walked out of the room. Within two minutes, two clinical researchers walked into my mom's room, where she was just told she was going to die in less than a year, and wanted her to sign off on them using her body for research and whatnot. Legit, two minutes after getting a death sentence, they wanted her to read these papers and repeat them to the researchers and sign off on her body. Can you imagine that\u2026.like are you f'ing kidding me!?!?!?!?!?!? My sister and I called UW Carbone Cancer Center in Madison, WI and got her in for a second opinion. I happen to know a doctor there so they were able to expedite her appointment. My whole family went to her initial appointment for the second opinion and this was with Dr. Burkard. HE IS INCREDIBLE!!!! He sat down with us for an hour and half and went over everything about breast cancer and how it works, the different types of treatments, the side effects, the successes and fails, everything! He seemed to be focusing on the treatment of the breast tumor and the liver but didn't really mention the lungs. We were kind of confused so we asked about her lungs and how he was going to treat that. He began to say that he wasn't concerned about her lungs and wasn't quite sure what the clinic that initially diagnosed her was seeing. He pulled up her scans from the clinic that initially diagnosed my mother and showed us her the two small spots on her lungs, that he couldn't be 100% sure were cancerous, and wondered why they told her that her lungs were filled with it. He said that humans are born with spots on their lungs so that's what this could be or it could be scar tissue which humans tend to have. He said he'd never say it spread to her lungs without extensive and invasive testing. He said though, that since it spread to her liver, the spots on her lungs are most likely cancerous but the absolute least of his concerns with her cancer. She went on to have four rounds of chemo, I can't remember what they were but I will find out. Chemo did what it was supposed to do and 'cleared the lungs, shrunk the spot on the liver, and shrunk the tumor in the breast.' Since she was doing so well, she participated in a clinical trial where she was taking two forms of chemo in pills; ribociclib and bicalutamid. She was on those for one month, which she started at the end of January 2018. She had a scan just this last week and the trial pills didn't work at all. The spots on her lungs and liver have grown as well as the breast tumor and has spread to her other breast. Her main onc was out of the country last week when her results came back but she saw another one in the department. The plan is to go back for more chemo but wanted to make sure she saw her main onc which she sees in 2 days to make sure he agrees with that plan. We are terrified for what he will say but very hopefully. We know this is not how it's going to end...this is not her time to go! It's been one hell of a roller coaster ride but no one is giving up. UGH! I can't even explain what the last 6 months have been like but I'm sure you all have an idea. Peace, love, strength, healing, and happiness to those fighting cancer and to their family members, their loved ones, their caregivers, and their support groups!",

I just lost my father to ALS in December and now today, my mom's oncologist just told us that if this last go at a chemo does't work, she has about three months. He then told us that if the chemo does work, she'll still only have about eight months since the cancer will become resistant to the chemo. MY. HEART. IS. BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Please hug all your loved ones soooo incredibly tight tonight and every single day! Here's to love, peace, healing, and finding a damn cure!!!!!!!!!",
