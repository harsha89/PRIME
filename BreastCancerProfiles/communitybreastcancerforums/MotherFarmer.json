I'm currently breastfeeding her and a few weeks ago found a painless pea sized hard lump in my left breast. I don't feel like it moves but couldn't say for sure. I found it accidentally, I leant on the bassinet on my right armpit and it really hurt and felt like something was there (possibly tender lymph nodes?) so I then proceeded to check my breasts and found it. It's quite deep in the flesh and not always easy to find but it's there with full, empty or half empty breasts. My breasts are quite lumpy as it is but this feels completely different to the rest of them. I had a lump when I was a teenager that was a benign cyst, I can't remember if it was soft or hard though. There is breast cancer in my family. My great grandmother had a double mastectomy and died of bowel cancer. I only found this out the other day. Of course now I've freaked myself out that it's cancer and has spread because I've had an ongoing cough since February. Which turned mucousy for which I went on 2 courses of antibiotics for, have also taken asthma preventatives that haven't worked. It has not gone away and I'm now getting a lot of dull chest pain deep in my chest and back and today it seems to be in my ribs too (unsure if back pain is related to baby holding etc) and fatigue. No energy or motivation to do anything although again that could be attributed to mum life, however ive only recently been feeling this way. I know no one can answer this for me and I'm seeing my doctor next week (seems so far away). But just interested in others opinions stories. I wish everyone diagnosed all the best on your journeys and hope you kick cancers butt xx Log in to post a reply",
