I am going for my 18th radiation treatment today (18 of 35) so I have passed my halfway point! Have a great day all!",

You can do this.  I spent my Mother's Day walking in the Race for the Cure in Philadelphia....what an experience if any of you get a chance to do it I would highly recommend it!  Stay strong all!",
