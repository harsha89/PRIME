The worst experience I had when getting the MRI Core Biopsy was getting a wide needle in my right breast.  I felt that as though, I was ready to pass out on the table, starting to sweat and could not wait until I drink some cold like \"orange juice or water\".   It is very nerve wracking whenever you go for mammography or follow-up procedure to find out a certain calcification was found in your breast.  When I listen to your stories, I know when the time comes, I will be strong enough to handle anything.   God bless to you all.  Your stories are very inspiring!",

After a return call to the office, I was advised that I needed a MRI Core Biopsy on my right side.  I had finally received a call from my doctor on Friday, September 4 that the MRI indicated two spots  were found near my arms.  Needless to say, I am still waiting to hear from Imaging center to schedule this MRI Core Biopsy.  I am definitely very concerned.  Please tell me how your results went.",
