Now I need a less expensive traditional form, to help extend the lives of the more expensive ones.  I have only had the Tria(normal weight Size 2), but am wondering if I would like the \"Light\" forms and if they would give less wear to the bra straps? Or would the weight difference really not be that noticeable in my small size?  Or would a light form in a small size, \"ride up\"? ddd Log in to post a reply",

Thank you for your help.  I am leaning toward cheaper, pending more feedback from others. :) ddd",

The clothes don't fit or look the same!  Duh!! There are plenty of attractive women with mastectomies that could model for these companies.  Makes me realize that it it is more about money than about helping people.",
