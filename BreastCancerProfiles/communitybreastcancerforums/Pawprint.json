Usually you hear this information from your doctor, after your doctor has all the information from the biopsy. I know you are scared. Really the not knowing and waiting is the hardest part. Once you know for sure and have a treatment plan the fear lessens. I truly hope it's not cancer, but if it is you will find lots of excellent information here at breastcancer.org, try not to research too much. I know that's hard. Sending a hug to you. Keep us posted when you talk to your doctor next Tuesday and you get biopsy results.",

I have tissue expanders in and they filled them half way during the surgery. The incisions were around my nipples and I am numb there. I think you will be pleased with your decision. I am heading out the door to go back to work, day one since surgery. Check out my posts and the other girls in the 2010 August Mastectomy group.Â  Good luck to you.",

When you get all the tests done the doctors will have a clearer picture and treatment plan. Sending hugs your way.",
