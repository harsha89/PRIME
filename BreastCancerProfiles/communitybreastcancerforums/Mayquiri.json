For a while now, I've had soem dimpling underneath my left breast.  It only shows up when I raise my arm, and is in a somewhat straighish line from my chest to my nipple, though it doesn't go all of the way to the chest.  I have no pain or discomfort, or any other symptoms despite regular breast checks.  I am 21 years, and the only history of breast cancer in my family that I know of would be my great grandmother on my moms side of the family.  I have a sneaking suspicion that I'm just being overly paranoid about my body, but this seems to be the best way to get a bit of an answer before I comit to going to the doctor for an exam(I have no health insurance).
