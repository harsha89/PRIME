I see rad office recommends eucerin and aquafor but hear clear aloe successes and calendula too. I am on #13 rad with 12 to go + 8-11 boosts. Help!",

I started to peel but one area stuck to sports bra and a layer came off. Now using silvadene but every time I wear clothing or use a pad, it peels off again and is bleeding.
