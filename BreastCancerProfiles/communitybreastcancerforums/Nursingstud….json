The radiologist reviewed my old MRI images and thinks it's best to get a new MRI to see if the spot they saw grew or changed at all/if there are any new spots. They don't do it at the base I'm at so I'm waiting for the civilian radiology center to call me and get scheduled. Is it possible to miss on ultrasound? I didn't have a mammogram so I don't know if anything would show there are not. Thanks",

He asked me if I had the report and I said it should be scanned in the system. He came back out and said the report, \"eased his mind a little bit.\" What the heck does that mean?! Before having the report his attitude seemed super concerned. Apparently because it didn't have characteristics of a benign mass (he listed multiple things that HAVE to be there to qualify) he thought that the Birads category should have been a 3 or 4, versus a 2. My mass was completely enhanced, it didn't have internal non enhancing pieces (fibro something) and it grabbed the contrast and enhanced(compared to not enhancing at all) He didn't blow me off and said that ultrasound and MRI compliment each other and that he is strongly reccomending a second MRI. The doctor that felt my breasts/saw the indent didn't he hesitate to order the MRI. Apparently the first radiologist shouldn't have used the words, \"for this age group\" at all. It makes me feel like if I were older the same mri would be super concerning. Now I'm waiting for insurances approval.  I just want to say thank you to all you wonderful ladies. It really does help to vent my worries while I play the waiting game. I appreciate you all more than you know. <3",

So I guess I will see what it shows!  I am a little worried because I went to the ER with trouble swallowing and the neck cut showednow I have multiple small bilateral cervical lymph nodes in the anterior and posterior triangles. I'm on antibiotics to see if that helps, but if they don't go away I have to have them biopsied. Can breast cancer cause both armpit and neck lymph nodes to swell?",
