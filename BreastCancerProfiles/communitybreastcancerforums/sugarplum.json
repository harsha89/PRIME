I haven't slept through the night since starting chemo in July of 2006 - that's when the hot flashes started happening every couple of hours, all night long, and haven't stopped since. I have bags under my eyes, have trouble concentrating/remembering, and am tired all the time. I let myself take an Ambien CR every Sunday night to start off the work week - it takes me down hard but only keeps me asleep for 4-5 hours, then the flashes start waking me up again. Halfway through the week I allow myself one Simply Sleep tablet (or a Tylenol PM if I have a headache) - it takes me down more slowly and I still don't sleep through, but it's easier to drift off again after the hot flashes - also I'm more relaxed and groggy the next morning than with Ambien CR. I'd love to take a half mg. of Ativan every day, but it's addictive so I save that for my occasional anxiety attacks!  At least I can think about all of you as I lie there & not feel so alone....

I had a MUGA scan before I started chemo back in 2006, but they've done no heart tests since except a routine EKG prior to my right hip replacement in 2014. Last year I began noticing missed beats which a Holter monitor identified as PVCs. There were also occasional little flashes of heart pain which were never really explained. This year a routine EKG turned up a left bundle branch block which led to a nuclear stress test, revealing my EF is at 44%. I visited a cardiologist yesterday who wants to do a CT angiogram to make sure he can clear me for left hip replacement (which is already scheduled for October 11th). If that shows problems, the next step is an invasive angiogram. I'm really trying hard not to freak out as this is all so new to me - I've NEVER had any heart problems in my 61 years so it's a whole different language to learn. I'm also wondering if the Arimidex I've been taking for 10+ years could be contributing to all this... Will continue to watch this thread with interest - Julie",

Wow, I'd never heard of a life vest before - I guess they skipped that with me & went straight to the defibrillator. Glad to hear you've come through that process OK. Since mine was implanted last August, it's recorded 3 times when my pulse went to 185 or so for a few seconds. None of them was I aware of however. It's set to shock me at 220 so I hope I never get there! For the past few weeks I've been noticing on & off flickers of discomfort, but since they haven't shown up on the readout I'm going to wait until my next appointment with the surgeon on 5/31 to address it (unless things get worse, of course). I'm currently on 12.5 mg of Coreg twice a day and 5 mg of Lisinopril once daily. Blood pressure too low to increase my dosage so that's why I had to have the defib put in.

Would be curious to know what meds you are on now and what the negative effects are...? I had my routine followup with the surgeon yesterday along with a device check (thankfully no other incidents of abnormally high pulse since March 5th). He wants to start ramping up my meds & doubled my daily lisinopril to 10mg (will be having blood drawn in a week to check liver function). I've been assigned a personal \"coach\" who is actually a PA specifically trained to fine-tune medications for his heart patients. Don't like the sound of the word \"tolerance level\" - to me that implies I'll have to suffer side effects until they get my dosages balanced (so far I haven't noticed anything from the Coreg or the lisinopril, for which I feel lucky).

I do have osteopenia (which I had before diagnosis - it's worsened but has been stable the past couple of years) and he also says there could be heart issues. The 2nd opinion onc said he would renew my Arimidex if I took a 3-6 month drug holiday. I have an appointment to see yet another onc in July, so I guess I'll just have to try & hold out until then!",

My question is - would it make more sense to check that out AFTER the Arimidex is no longer in my system? To see what level I'm left with, medication-free? I will definitely bring that up to my (3rd opinion) oncologist whom I am scheduled to meet in July. I'm going to space out my bootlegged stash of pills to every other day - that way I'll only have to be completely off for 4 weeks before seeing the new guy. Mental gymnastics? Maybe :) Good exercise?

Of course I ended up doing everything they suggested, including the ooph.). Her estimate sounds backwards to what you were told, Naomi - was she just trying to keep me from jumping in front of a car?! And even at that, it has freaked me out every day since then.

The day that saved my life actually happened a couple of months before my 4/28/06 diagnosis: I had randomly grabbed a paperback in a store & read that scar tissue in the breast could hide a malignancy. Four years earlier I'd had a surgical biopsy for calcifications...it turned out to be benign, but every year my breast got lumpier even though my mammograms were normal. The doctors kept telling me it was just scar tissue, but after I read that paragraph I pushed for another biopsy which came up - ooops - positive. Had I not followed my gut and become my own advocate, I most certainly wouldn't be here celebrating today. I wish nothing but the best for all of us - we're all stronger than we could've ever imagined! Julie",

When I finished treatment in 2007, my first scare was dizziness/spaciness which I was sure I could attribute to brain mets. The following year I had aching in my tailbone, so persistent that they ordered a nuclear bone scan (which revealed nothing - I ended up just buying a pillow to sit on). Hip pain in 2011 prompted another bone scan - turned out to be arthritis, got a new hip out of the deal. Dry coughing on & off for a couple of years - lung mets? Nope. Now I have an ache in my left groin (on & off since last October) for which I'm having an ultrasound tomorrow - I'm suspecting an inguinal hernia, but who knows? Just another one of the gifts BC gives - always waiting for the other shoe to drop... Best to all - Julie ",

I've been having flashbacks to when I was off work during my 9-month BC treatment in 2006 - but my dear husband points out that this time, instead of feeling worse & worse I will be feeling better & better. We're going back to see my surgeon for post-op this Thursday, so maybe he will open my world up a bit after seeing me walking without a limp! Alloway, how did your appointment go on the 10th?
