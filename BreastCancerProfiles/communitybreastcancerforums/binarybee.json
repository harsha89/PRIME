The part that piqued my wonder was that I was very non-reactive and all of the staff indicated that I was more calm than they were expecting, which made me in turn wonder if I actually had something to worry about. :)",

I am waiting (hi!) but I weirdly was wondering what the worst my results could be, in part so my very pragmatic self could be best prepared. My screening results said I was BIRADS 4B with \"grouped, slightly pleomorphic calcifications\". I keep telling myself that the biopsy results will be the only certain way to diagnose but... is there a place to see what the worst COULD be? I just figure that maybe I could stop having the awful serial dreams I'm having every night while wondering. :( ETA a bit about me: 38yo w/2 kids. I had my second, high-res screening the day of the funeral for my friend who lost a 4y battle with b/c. :( Log in to post a reply",

I am an extremely accomplished compartmentalizer so I've been essentially doing my best not to think about anything past the fact that it's ... maybe a good thing that they scheduled my biopsy out 2 weeks after my compression mammogram? I guess? I made the mistake of reading up a lot on BIRADS and what they mean and comparing them to the text of my lab results when I realized I just would be better off not thinking about this at all until I had something concrete to think about.  So, the part of me that is the compartmentalizer also feels like an idiot freaking out to my friends/family (who would be supportive, should I give them the opportunity) when there is nothing concrete to freak out about.  Sigh. Mind if I hang with you all for a bit? :)",
