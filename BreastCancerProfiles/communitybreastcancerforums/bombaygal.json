I had my Lumpectomy in April, 1.5 cm since a couple of months I have developed intense ache and pain in my shoulder and neck on the side of my good breast. After, physical therapy and pain killer, muscle relaxants and the rest, nothing really helps for long.  I started thinking if it could be related to the uneven proportion of the breasts after surgery. Has anybody else had similar issues?",

My Onc was not happy, but since she said its my decision, I chose to excercise it, not a lot we have control over in this fight, lets use what we have. I am in San diego CA. who is your Onc? On a different note, I had my first consult with Radiation and they were such a nice bunch of people, makes me want to go back...sweet, gentle and patient...made such a difference! maybe we could use this thread to recommend facilities, I know, the last thing on our minds is research places, but they make a such a difference in our treatments and our attitudes to it.",

SherryC, I had an Oncotype DX test too, my score was 16. My Onc, mentioned the cap on the test was 18 last year,it changed to 11 this year, and since I fall in the grey area, she feels I should do the chemo. But, she also agrees that they might change the stats next year and I might fall in the safe zone ;) so much for test results...I do realize they have to cover themselves, so they go for overkill....but my body is the warzone...I feel so overwhelmed, as I dont want to take any chances.. I do plan on getting a second opinion. K167 - that is a new one, I should ask her about it.",

BTW, Mostlymom,I took a week off, after my Lumpectomy, but went back in 3 days, as was feeling fine and getting restless, was hiking a week later...just listen to your body, rest when it wants and eat well...  ",
