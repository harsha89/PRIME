LOL  Anyway I insisted on scans and they told me the same...not unless I have symptoms... so I said  \"yeah I have lots of bone pain\", probably just arthritis, but i want to know.  So my onc did not argue any further and ordered  chest, abd, and bone scans.  They just dont get what its like to find out you have cancer and the constant wondering if its somewheres else.  It doesnt come out of their pocket,so just indulge us a little.",

While checking the uakron.edu site to see if my son got us grad tickets I came across an article about what the university is doing with polymer in making implants for breast cancer patients. Apparantly, polymer is stronger and will not break or leak and they can implant a drug that will detect any stray cells and attack them. Pretty impressive stuff...not sure what stage of development they are in, I think they just got funding to continue the research. So all you ohio gals should be so proud of what your state is accomplishing! Prayers to all of you going through chemo...I understand the crawling in bed till its over...It is OK to do what your body is telling you and do whatever it takes to get through this. Thank You Ohio!!",

We stayed in Cuyahoga Falls, visited Solon (son is looking a buying a home) went to a Marina in Cleveland ( to view a boat).  Daughter flew in to Columbus to visit a client for work then took a bus up to Akron for the graduation....so in 3 days we pretty much covered a lot of Ohio.  My daughters comment was that she noticed how clean and beautiful they keep their cities...I agree. BTW  your weather is just slightly better than upstate NY...we have 2 seasons  winter and the 4th of July. I did chemo first then surgery then rads,  it seems like there was a month window inbetween each session.  They always wanted me to rest and heal before moving on.  Needed some revision done last with the nipple surgery and the PS wanted me 6 months out from rads to do this, so it has been a long journey and I was very impatient.  Now cant get my tattoo until July because she is booked.  I have thought about doing something crazy on there but not sure I have the guts....WTH? Me and my husband are the only ones that will see it....till I get to the nursing home   ha ha",
