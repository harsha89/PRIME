At the time she was treated with surgery and radiation. In april 2007 a CT guided FNAC from chest wall region was done and reported as recurrence of Duct Carcinoma. This was treated with surgery (OOPHERECTOMY) and hormonal treatment (Femmera). Now, in Feb 2011, she has been diagnosed with metastasis to the bone (femur, lower spine and ribs) and liver (extensive in the liver). By Feb she had developed grade 2 ascites and was admitted and started on Taxol and Carboplatin (very small dose). However, within 24 hours of the 1st dose she developed Hepatic Encaphalopathy. She managed to come out of that and has turned the corner in the last 2 months. Shes been on a 4 week dose of Cisplatin which has brought down her LFT abnormality a little. However her bilirubin still fluctuates between 3.5 and 5. Doctor has started he on Xeloda and says he can't give her the nanoparticle treatment planned till her bilirubin is 2. Any options to bring the bilirubin down? Has anyone here experienced a similar situation and responded well to different treatments? Â I am desperately looking for hope!! Log in to post a reply",
