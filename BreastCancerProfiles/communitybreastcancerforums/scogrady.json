My mom was just diagnosed after 6 years of living with metastatic breast cancer. Would you mind telling me your treatment? I asked for her to be put back on xeloda from reading blogs. I wanted to start with a treatment less harsh first. It worked great for her 6 years ago when she was first diagnosed, but then stopped working about 9 months after, so I wonder if it can be successful the second time around. I would love to know how you have been since your diagnosis and any pointers you may have. My mom is being treated at Sloan Kettering supposedly one of the best cancer centers n the US. But they just seem out of thier depth like they are ready to give up on her. It makes me happy to see people like yourself doing well after diagnosis. Any info would be greatly appreciated.",
