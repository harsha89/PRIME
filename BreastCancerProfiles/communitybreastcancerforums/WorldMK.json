So inspite of what sounded like alarmist and serious report, there was no cancer. I wanted to write this for everyone who may read reports and spend hours Googling medical terminology and diagnosing themselves. My husband said to me ' no one ever goes on forums to tell the good news so when you google posterior acoustic shadowing, only the serious stuff Come up.' So I wanted to say that I am one of those who had PAS and biopsy came clear. Wish you all the best. X",
