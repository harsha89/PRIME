My case is a bit complicated because I have a very active case of Lupus. Rad Onc said radiation will be very dangerous...connective tissue problems as well as risk of lymph edema, even though only 4 lymph nodes removed and all 4 were negative. She is willing to do it, just made me sign extra waivers and wanted me to know it's extra risky. My problem is they have scared the ever living hell out of me and now I don't know what to do. I'm on hormone therapy, (just started yesterday) and was actually hoping for chemo,because I felt that would be less dangerous than the radiation, and I was told by my rheumatologist that it would also help my Lupus. The Oncologist made the decision without me, and pretty much said sorry about your luck, it's not an option......however, 2 weeks ago she was all about chemo (before she had the oncotype). I have been reading a lot on the discussion boards and there are many cases where chemo was done with a 20 oncotype, so I'm just wondering why the change of heart all of a sudden? I was told by the radiation doc to go back to the surgeon and have a mastectomy (after already having lumpectomy) and then the Oncologist also hinted at this as well. I didn't have one because the surgeon assured me it wasn't necessary. Why, now, after the fact, would I go back and do it??? So now they are taking the let's just watch it approach...and I am absolutely not comfortable with that. What would you do??",

She also needs stability, and needs to know I'm going to be ok, so I have reassured her that although I'm going to be bald, and maybe throw up a little, I'm going to be just fine. She will be ok I think. As long as she has food, she's golden lol. I'm wig shopping, and I'm including her in that process, I'm even going to let her help shave my head--she thinks that is hilarious! So, she is not traumatized at all with all of this, in fact, she gets to have sleepovers with her sister and her cousins, so she's kind of liking it. She's 4, cancer is just another word to her.",

Sounds like you've had your fair share, I'm sorry for your losses. I'm glad your kids and husband have Nana close by. Even though they're aware, and included in the process, it can still be scary. Also with losing Grandpa, that has to be in the back of their minds, so they definitely need somewhere to \"escape\". Mine are 32, 29, and 26, and they can't even talk about it. The 4 year old is stuck here, so she really has no choice, but the other ones don't even come around. (unless, of course, they need something). It's almost like outa sight, outa mind. I'm sure they're afraid, and they can't bear the thought of me dying. (even though I'm not going to. when people hear cancer, that's immediately what they think sometimes.) It's sad though, because although I understand, I sometimes feel they don't care. I don't know how many of you have experienced this---Other people don't know how to react to us. they don't know what to say, they don't know how to feel. Sooooo, they just avoid us. Which is really sad, because I don't know about you ladies, but I have never felt more alone in my life. I feel so stressed and overwhelmed by life's circumstances that I could just scream and cry and throw a big ol hissy fit! But what would that get me? A few nights stay in the loony bin perhaps, and that's not the kind of vacation I need! I guess I just need some support and to know that my friends and family are here and they care...but I am oh so grateful I found this site, and you ladies! Thank you all for being so welcoming and supportive---and for the wealth of information. I have learned so much in my short time on here, things I never would have known. WenchLori Thanks for the warm welcome! djm71 Sounds like you got a great deal on the wigs! I've been looking into synthetic, and some can actually be curled and straightened, and washed, so I'm exploring that option. My MO told me (I haven't started yet) you'll feel real bad, start to feel good, just in time for another treatment. So sounds just about right. Hope your next one's not so brutal on you. Hopefloats Twins--God bless you!",

What in the world was I thinking? Holy Moly The sickest I've ever been doesn't begin to compare to this....how come no one told me that? You all say it's \"doable\" I'm not sure I agree. Yesterday was the worst day of my life as far as pain and sickness. (and it's a weird sickness, one I couldn't hardly describe.) Wanted to barf, but couldn't, the muscle and bone pain was unbearable. I also had no pain meds...Insurance loophole, too many scripts this month... Just wondering who else has experienced this and does it get better or worse? Not sure I can hang!",
