My primary doc said its a breast cyst, but now its getting harder and its right below my collar bone on the right side. I think its a lymph node, but am not a doctor obviously and will show it to my breast surgeon next week too for futher investigation. Just confused and will keep you posted erinm. Thank you both for replying. Any other insight into this would be greatly appreciated by anybody else. Thanks.",

However, now that same left breast is bothering me again. I had a clear discharge out of my left nipple when I was sitting and working from home. I did a self exam I noticed an indentation on the lower side of my left Breast when I raise my arm. I made an appt with by obgyn for Monday. I don\u2019t want to tell anyone this time becuase I had everyone worried last time I had a scare. I had my first scare with the same Breast 6 years ago. I am 38 now! Ugh I just want to know if anyone else had these symptoms and what their prognosis is/was? Log in to post a reply",

The OBGYN can also see you and yes that would get you in faster. After the docot does a breast exam they will send you to get a mammo and Ultrasound. I have a lump on my left breast and when I went to see my primary doc she felt it too and she felt swollen lymph nodes under my armpit; she sent me for both q mammo and ultrasound and they couldn't see anything and my doc said it's fibrocystic. I changed doc and my second doc said the same, but with my persistence referred me to a breast surgeon, which I will see on the 24th. These forums help and your not alone! My advice is see an OBGYN and get the necessary tests done so when it's time to see the specialist the test results are in and they don't make you wait for another appt with a specialist few more months down. I hope this helps, but I am in the same boat and still will not settle until a biopsy confirms fibrocystic. Good luck and just be prepared for the specialist with your test results, it's one step at a time.",
