I couldn't ask a lot of questions as I was standing in the middle of a convenience store with my 8 year old..... but what the heck?  I am supposed to wait four months for what?  Is he going to see if it grows?  Why can't they just do a biopsy now?  Just wondering if anyone here has experienced this..... I am 45, my paternal aunt was diagnosed at 65, other than that, no family history of breast cancer at all. Thank you in advance to anyone who replies! Log in to post a reply",

I'm going to call back tomorrow and ask more questions.  I was just caught off guard, and of course, being in the middle of 7-11 isn't exactly the best place to have a medical conversation! I really appreciate your responses.  I don't want to tell anyone IRL because I don't want anyone to worry about something that is probably nothing.  So thank you very much!!!",
