I just finished chemo and am starting Tamoxifen this week. My MO said she may let me stop it after 2 years to try to do an embryo transfer and have a baby (I did IVF right before I found out the BC). After that she wants me to go back on Tamoxifen. Just wondering if anyone knows of women who have taken a break from Tamox to have a baby and are OK now? Thank you and hope everyone is having a nice weekend.",

Have a question - how long do people normally wait to start tamox after finishing chemo? My MO said I can start whenever I want. Anyone know when a good time is to start? Thanks ladies!",
