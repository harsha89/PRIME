Both ALH and LCIS are sometimes/often classified together as 'lobular neoplasm'. But, just about everything concerning LCIS, thus probably ALH, is controversial. So don't be shocked if you get different opinions from different doctors. I am not sure whether or not you have had the spot surgically excised. If you haven't you may want to strongly consider that. (Up to Date, a reference, said its a 'standard of care' for ALH found on a biopsy to have it excised.) But, this too is probably controversial. The reason why they often like to excise is not to remove the ALH, or 'all the ALH', because its likely there are multiple spots of ALH in your breast or breasts, but to make sure there isn't something more concerning going on, like DCIS or invasive breast cancer, which is treated differently. Roughly 10-20% of the time these things are upgraded on surgical excision. If you don't want to take tamoxifen, there are other anti-estrogen medications that can be used if you are postmenopausal. They have a somewhat different adverse effect profile. Also, I wouldn't take the number of posts in a forum as indicating how frequently a particular adverse effect happens. It is well known that people who have an adverse effect post MUCH more than people who don't have an adverse effect. Studies are a much more reliable source for suggesting how often a particular adverse effect happens. There is also the option of simply watchful waiting. If you are at higher risk, then some women opt for prophylactic bilateral mastectomies. You may want to consider getting genetically evaluated - to see if you/your insurance will pay for genetic testing, if you're interested in that. If you have a significant genetic defect, this may affect your treatment decisions. 'High' risk is relative. I have seen papers that claim that LCIS women are not at high risk, and LCIS is more advanced than ALH. Probably LCIS women (and nothing else) have less than a 50% chance of getting breast cancer in their lifetime. It is normally thought that ALH women have a lower breast cancer risk than LCIS women. If you have more risk factors that does NOT NECESSARILY mean that you are at higher risk. (BRCA mutations may be an exception.) Lots is unknown regarding lobular neoplasia. Breast risk calculators are not necessarily accurate for an individual; all of the ones I know of say that they 'should not be used to make clinical decisions' because, while they may be accurate for a population (for example, they might be able to accurately say that, say, about 300 women in a population of 100,000 (I'm making these numbers up - so they're probably drastically wrong) will get breast cancer, they do NOT say which individual particular women will get breast cancer - that Janine, Nina, Abigail, Tamika, Emma and 295 other women will get breast cancer in their lifetime (making up women's names.)

It took something like 6 months to go away, and turned all sorts of beautiful autumnal colors (black, purple, green, yellow.) It takes time for the body to re-absorb heme and iron. But it only looked horrible; it wasn't painful. Since the hematoma is coagulated blood, thus contains iron, a heavy metal, it shows up on mammograms. They may not be able to clearly see your 2nd cluster of microcalcs in mammograms if your hematoma covers that area. It sure would be nice if they explained their reasoning or plan to you. Yes, I have a 2nd breast excision scheduled for mid-Jan. 2018. I doubt they would put me back on an antihormonal, unless they find something worse like DCIS or invasive breast cancer. (I had 5 years of tamoxifen.) I did have benign cervical polyps every 18 months or so when on tamoxifen. LCIS is almost always multifocal, so there are probably other spots of ALH and LCIS in my breasts. Strange that they should want an oncologists' opinion. They (the oncologist) aren't the ones that would be doing the surgery. Maybe it was reviewed by a person who didn't know much about breast cancer. (I have heard that sometimes/often they have RNs reviewing claims.) Once I went to a conference about infectious diseases, and the infectious disease head (of course an MD) wanted to use very expensive antibiotic X. The insurance company wrote back and wanted him to use cheap, inexpensive antibiotic Y. The MD wrote back to the insurance company that the cultured bacteria was resistant to antibiotic Y, which was why he wanted to use antibiotic X because it was the only antibiotic that the bacteria was sensitive to.

Many women have never had a breast biopsy. Many studies have less than 100 patients, and they often combine ALH with ADH with LCIS to get groups large enough to study. As far as alternatives, for example, in this study of about 1000 women, exemestane in this study did NOT have an increased incidence of thromboembolism but did have an increased risk of joint stiffness, arthralgia and osteoporosis. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855103 (There are other antihormonals too.)

Your mammogram report is very factually stating what they say on your mammogram.  So if it was a photo of your face, they would be describing your skeletal structure, the shape and color of your eyes, nose, mouth, your complexion, the presence of any moles or freckles, etc.  The more 'negative' imaging you have, the better.  Looking at a mammogram is like looking at a clear balloon that has writing on it, from the opposite side of the balloon.  If the writing is on the edge of the balloon, it can be hard to read. They are asking for the MRI because they don't feel the mammogram and ultrasound were conclusive. MRIs are usually quite sensitive.  That means they usually pick up cancer, but they can also pick up a lot of benign stuff, like inflammation. It takes skill to interpret MRIs. Many women feel distraction helps.  I couldn't do things I enjoyed,but I could do things I hated.  Some people feel going out with friends, or seeing a light comedy helps.   If things are really awful, some people go to their doctor (typically their General Practitioner) to get a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication.

The radiology report just is plainly stating what they see on the imaging.  For example, if they had a photo of your face, they'd be describing the shape of your face, and the color and texture of your hair, and eye color, etc.  They are describing in very precise terms (though we can't understand them :-)) what your imaging looks like: where there are dark spots and where there are light spots. The words that have 'echoic' in them are describing whether or not sound waves (from the ultrasound) were bouncing off of the lesion.  They are NOT saying that you have breast cancer in Greek or Latin. Cysts are almost always benign. BIRADS is a system that rates breast imaging.  Here's a link to BIRADS scores.  A chart is in yellow about half way down the website on the left.  Its probably more than you ever wanted to know. http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4349108442109#a43db92b2e8101 If you want to go to a 2nd opinion, you certainly can.  I think 2nd opinions are always helpful: even if you disagree with them,you are always getting more information. But I don't think there is any rush in doing so, especially if this will cost you several hundred dollars extra.  (When I had a 2nd opinion, it took about 2 months and they still messed up co-ordinating things.  But you are in a different situation.) If you were NOT anxious, then I'd be wondering if you were in DeNile.  Of course you are anxious. Anybody in their right mind would be anxious. Unfortunately, there is little in breast cancer (or for that matter, cancer in general) that is 100% sure.   But your radiologist did rate your imaging as 'probably benign'.  That is good. If you are going to get a 2nd opinion, though, I think it would be best to go to a breast surgeon, who is the expert at diagnosing things, or a radiologist who specializes in breast conditions.  A general surgeon is an expert at doing surgery all over one's body, so usually won't be an expert on breasts.  Even ****IF**** your radiologist is completely wrong, and you do have breast cancer, know that most breast cancers are fairly slow growing.  Most breast cancers have been growing for some 4-10 years (not a typo) before its big enough to be detected by ANY means (including feel, mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI.)   So while you may be a psych patient by the time you feel you get confident of your diagnosis, it probably won't matter as far as your medical condition goes. Some people feel distraction helps with the anxiety.  (There are a variety of distractions that help different people, including exercise, housework, retail therapy, meditation, religion - if you are into that, a favority hobby, etc.) If that isn't sufficient, then some people choose to go to their GP and get some anti-anxiety meds. We're here for you!  Feel free to vent or ask questions.",

The main gist of the thread was that I found out how poorly we can predict breast cancer - we really do not know what causes it.   We can fairly accurately predict how many women in a town in the United States or Florence, Italy may get breast cancer, but we have very little idea WHICH of these women will get breast cancer.    In the meantime, bc.org updated their estimates of risk for LCIS - to about  30-40% lifetime risk by one estimate, or, in another estimate, increases the breast cancer risk to 21% over the next 15 years. www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/...  .  (Most LCIS is diagnosed in the 40-50 year old age group.) They also updated the LCIS  treatment options. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/lcis/treatment.jsp Has anyone participated in clinical trials for LCIS and nothing worse? The ones I can find are: Soy Protein Supplement In Treating Hot Flashes in Postmenopausal Women Receiving Tamoxifen for Breast Disease Exemestane in Treating Postmenopausal Women at High Risk for Invasive Breast Cancer Letrozole in Preventing Breast Cancer in Postmenopausal Women Possibly for LCIS women who have had surgery  Infliximab in Treating Cancer-Related Fatigue in Postmenopausal Women Who Have Undergone Treatment for Stage 0, Stage I, or Stage II Breast Cancer Atorvastatin in Preventing Breast Cancer in Women at Increased Risk for Breast Cancer",

These sites may be helpful:http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf05/brcagen/brcagenrs.htm#clinical http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4793bfde0ed53 If you do ask for an MRI, I would check to see if it will be covered by insurance.  There are women with LCIS (which definitely puts them at higher risk), and dense breasts, and their insurance would not cover.  It can cost over $1K.  Since it was not covered, they have to pay out of pocket.  I just don't want you to have unexpected expenses. I get the impression that breast density means what your breast looks like under a mammogram, and not how it feels.  I have very soft breasts, I have never had a lump, and I was told by the radiologist I have 'dense, but not extremely dense' breasts. Of course, having lumpy, ropey breasts makes them a lot harder to examine.",

(My breast history in a nutshell : LCIS with nothing worse since 12-05 core biopsy, excision confirming 1-06, with weak family history of breast cancer, on tamoxifen since 7-06, 2 benign biopsies (consistent with scar tissue) 2-07. The radiologist stated my breasts mammos are 'dense', but not 'very dense'.) I was first seen by a nurse practitioner (I think I knew more about LCIS than she did. She said she was formerly a nurse practitioner with my current GP!!), then by a breast surgeon. 1) They did NOT reread my slides; that may occur in the next several weeks. 2) They said they use the Gail model for LCIS patients. (Of course the Gail model on the NCI website specifically says this model is NOT valid with LCIS. http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ ) So apparently they treat LCIS as ALH. They said my lifetime risk for breast cancer was between 8-60% (8% being that for an average American woman.) If they had to quote a number, they said between 10-20%. (If you stick my numbers in the NCI website calculator, and consider LCIS as ALH, you get 22%.) If they got any more accurate, they'd have to pull out papers. (Of course some of the more current papers say about 1%/yr. Since I am 54, if I lived until 75, this would be about 20%. This does not include factors such as dense, but not very dense breasts. 3) For LCIS women, they do yearly mammos, and twice yearly clinical exams, and that's it. MRIs are discussed, tamoxifen is discussed. The surgeon did NOT recommend MRIs for me because I had so much scar tissue it would just yield false positives. (Currently, with my local care, I seem to be having mammos and ultrasounds every 6 months.) 4) The surgeon did NOT recommend PBMs for me, however, both the NP and surgeon said it was not unreasonable (ie out of the question). The surgeon would NOT bar the way to OR for me, as it seemed my current breast surgeon (who said 'she was not interested in any further surgery for me.') 5) For LCIS women that opt for tamoxifen, they have a breast surgeon recommend this, not a medical oncologist. No, I did not get the names of experts. By that time I had been up for 20 hrs straight. At least the surgeon was open to BPMs. I am very confused about their breast cancer risk numbers. (I had printed out Dr. Hall's calculator.) In 3-06, with my genetics counseling (I was NOT tested), the genetics counselor, without breast density info, gave me a number of 40%.) Monitoring make me crazy, and so does not monitoring. If you have LCIS and nothing worse, and have a weak family history, what kind of numbers were you quoted for your lifetime risk (without SERMs)?

(We don't know if the lobules intersect.) These epithelial cells are like cars that line the street.  The sidewalks are like the basement membrane that separate the epithelial cells from the rest of the breast tissue.  When you have totally normal ducts and lobules, there is only one single layer of cars that line the streets.  There is no double parking.  If you have lots of double parking, then this is like hyperplasia.  If the cars look beat up, then that makes them 'atypical'.  None of the cars (atypical cells) are crossing the sidewalk (the basement membrane) to get into the driveways or garages.  If the cars drove through the sidewalks, then that would be 'invasive breast cancer'.   But in ALH and ADH, you have several layers of beat up cars that line the streets.  In LCIS - lobular carcinoma in situ-  (which is thought to be a more advanced case of ALH) the beat up cars fill up the dead-end streets, but they don't cross the sidewalk.  In DCIS  - ductal carcinoma in situ - (which is thought to be a more advanced case of ADH), these atypical cells also fill up the ducts.  There are many more types of DCIS  than LCIS.   (These 'subtypes' of DCIS and LCIS are thought to have different 'personalities' - some are fairly mild and would never progress to anything worse, and others more aggressive.) They are doing an excision of the area to help make sure there isn't anything worse in the area.   For ALH, ADH, and LCIS, if you have atypical cells at the margin of where the surgeon cuts, they usually don't re-excise and try to get it all out.  If you have DCIS or anything worse (in other words invasive breast cancer), they usually re-excise to remove most/all of the abnormal cells.  They don't try to excise all the LCIS because there are normally many spots of LCIS in a breast, and they would have no way of knowing where they are in a breast without doing a mastectomy.  If you are BRCA positive, then that would be much more of a risk factor than would the condition of ALH, ADH, LCIS, or at least most if not all cases of DCIS would confer.  (I don't know that much about DCIS since I don't have it.)  These are the guidelines that the US preventative task force have come out with for BRCA testing. www.uspreventiveservicestaskfo...   If you have an unusual family pattern, such as one of your parents were an only child, or your father's mother had breast cancer but she only had sons, then you may need evaluation by a geneticist.  Only about 2% of the general population meet the USPTF guidelines.  Those that do not have a low probability of having a deleterious BRCA mutation. To give you some idea, I have classic LCIS, the most benign type, with a low risk family history.  (I have 1 paternal grandmother who had breast cancer, 2 maternal aunts who had breast cancer, all these were post-menopausal - after the age of 50.  No ovarian cancer.)  My lifetime risk of breast cancer (which would include an additional diagnosis of DCIS or invasive breast cancer) is about 30%.  There is a lot of uncertainty about this number - one 2nd opinion said my risk was somewhere between 10% and 60% but it was probably much closer to 10% than 60%.  Every paper I've read says that ALH and/or ADH confer less risk for breast cancer than LCIS.   Remember that about 12% of the general population of women in the USA are predicted to get breast cancer sometime in their lifetime.  Women with a deleterious BRCA gene are thought to have a 35-84% lifetime chance of getting breast cancer.  Note these numbers are not the women that *die* of breast cancer; its the number that get breast cancer.  Overall, most (the majority) of women who do get breast cancer end up dying of something OTHER THAN breast cancer.",

If I were you, I'd ask for a copy of your pathology report.  I know you are scared because your mom died of breast cancer, but since she was postmenopausal at diagnosis, that makes it less likely any breast condition you *might* have would be due to a single inherited gene  (most commonly BRCA1 or BRCA2).  Depending on your family history, you may not even qualify for BRCA testing. Remember, only about 15% of breast cancers are thought to be due to single gene inheritable conditions. If you have 'slightly atypical cells', then to me that suggests you do not even have ADH or ALH (which would normally be at least described as atypical, not slightly atypical.)  They won't be able to tell you *your* risk of breast cancer, but they may be able to describe the risk of breast cancer for many people who are like you.  If they will commit to a number like this, it will be a very inexact number, because its very hard to predict the risk of breast cancer for one particular person. They are doing the surgical biopsy to see if there is anything worse in the area.  Different studies differ, but for example, if you have FEA, then this study found about a 10% chance of it being upgraded to something worse.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22...  That means that 90% of these patients did NOT have anything worse.  Those aren't bad odds. I know this won't stop you from worrying, but your odds are good that there will be nothing worse going on.  Let us know how it goes, OK?",

That said, breast pain is quite common.  This is a blurb from Mayo Clinic. www.mayoclinic.com/health/brea... It sounds like often they can't find a cause of breast pain, but its usually not serious. You do have a considerable family history with your mother having breast cancer before the age of 50.  Its important that you report any breast *changes*. I'm not sure what you mean about breast density.  If there are new spots of breast lumps or hardness, then that's good to get  checked out. Any breast changes should be investigated, and you should emphasize your mother's breast cancer. They normally try to avoid mammograms for women at younger ages due to radiation concerns.  Women who get large doses of chest radiation near the time of puberty have an increased risk of breast cancer later in their age: particularly women who have had radiation *treatment* (in other words, radiation for conditions such as lymphoma.)  Ultrasounds or MRIs do not work by radiation and are normally considered safe. If you have a new breast lump, it is common for young women your age to get benign breast lumps called fibroadenomas.  But if these breast densities are new, then get them checked out. There are few 20 year olds who are diagnosed with breast cancer.  I won't tell you 100% what you should do, but these would be some of the things I would consider in your situation.",

Different facilities differ, but I was told I could not have a mammo for 6 months after my biopsy (I think because it is hard to tell healing tissue from abnormalities.)  I was also told I couldn't have an MRI as screening because I have too much scar tissue.

State regulations tend to vary widely, and often depend on how the provider is licensed. Physicians are less likely to be subject to state regulations regarding retention of medical records than hospitals and other institutional providers which usually are governed by specific state licensure requirements. State licensing agencies may impose longer retention periods for X-rays and similar documents than for other types of medical records. Under Medicare, the retention periods range from five to seven years, depending on the particular coverage program or type of document. Other third-party payors generally impose similar requirements, although the contractual terms of the agreement may need to be reviewed. The American Hospital Association and American Health Information Management Association both recommend retaining medical records for at least 10 years after a patient's most recent treatment. Longer periods are recommended if the patient received experimental treatment since the records could be needed for future medical research. http://library.findlaw.com/1998/Jan/1/127216.html",

They could always do an excisional biopsy, if needed.   I don't think a breast MRI is *definitely* out-of-the-question.  Probably different opinions differ, but, if you had your fallopian tubes clamped a while ago, I would guess they *may* be able to do an MRI.  They don't list fallopian tubes as an 'absolute contraindication' to MRI on this NIH website. www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/en...

How greatly does having LCIS increase breast cancer risk? One estimate is that the lifetime risk of developing an invasive breast cancer is 30-40% for women with LCIS, versus a lifetime risk of 12.5% for the average woman. Another estimate suggests that an LCIS diagnosis increases breast cancer risk to 21% over the next 15 years.http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/lcis/cancer_risk.jsp RE: radiation and LCIS: Maybe your onc liked the 2 papers I cited in your other thread. The 'self exam' statement is probably from these findings: Breast self-exam (BSE), or regularly examining your breasts on your own, can be an important way to find a breast cancer early, when it's more likely to be treated successfully. Not every cancer can be found this way, but it is a critical step you can and should take for yourself. Over the years, there has been some debate over just how valuable BSE is in detecting breast cancer early and increasing the likelihood of survival. For example, in summer 2008, one study of nearly 400,000 women in Russia and China reported that breast self-examination does not reduce breast cancer mortality and may even cause harm by prompting unnecessary biopsies (removal and examination of suspicious tissue). Because of the ongoing uncertainty raised by this and other studies, the American Cancer Society has chosen to advise women that BSE is an \u201coptional\u201d screening tool. Breastcancer.org still believes that BSE is a useful and essential screening strategy, especially when used in combination with regular physical exams by a doctor and mammography. About 20% of the time, breast cancers are found by physical examination rather than by mammography. We recommend that all women routinely perform breast self-exams as part of their overall breast cancer screening strategy. Read what Marisa Weiss, M.D., president and founder of Breastcancer.org, has to say about the July 2008 study of breast self-exam.http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/self_exam/index.jsp You are undergoing a lot of stress about many issues in your life.  That's very understandable.  You're also getting widely varying recommendations.  It must be very hard to choose what to do.",

I totally agree with what the others have said: try not to read too much into what they are choosing for you.  Its quite unlikely they are hiding any information from you.  Its like looking at a friend from the back:  a person might have the same hair color and style of your friend, wear the same style of clothes and be the same height and physical structure (this would be analogous to what they see in mammograms and/or ultrasounds/imaging), but they won't know for sure until your friend turns around and you see your friend's face (you have your biopsy).  Almost all breast cancer is diagnosed by looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope (the only possible exception being the unusual inflammatory breast cancer, which is sometimes a clinical diagnosis, and you almost certainly don't have any symptoms for inflammatory breast cancer).  Imaging/symptoms aside, I think the only people that almost everyone would consider a high risk person (who hasn't personally had breast cancer) are women who have a significant family history (which in general means a greater breast cancer incidence than solely having 1 first degree relative - mother, father, sibling, offspring- with breast or ovarian cancer), have a known deleterious BRCA mutation, and/or radiation treatment to the chest (such as after having some types of lymphoma), or being a nuclear blast/accident survivor.  (Chest Xrays for diagnosis don't count.)

Remember that 'about twice the risk of breast cancer' does NOT mean 2x 13%=26% lifetime risk for breast cancer.  Twice the risk means twice the risk of a woman WITHOUT any risk factors, which is something like 3-5%, so because of the radial scar one's lifetime risk for breast cancer might be 6-10%. (We don't know if you have additional risk factors if they would add to this risk.) The 'average' woman in the US has a lifetime risk of breast cancer of about 13%.",

There are several kinds of calcifications that show up in mammos. Calcifications are VERY common. Big calcifications are associated with being benign, and are often associated with age or trauma. Tiny spots (that look like speckles of salt) or branched type calcifications can be a sign of concern. But even these types - ones that look like salt or look like branching - are usually benign. 80% of biopsies, even of calcifications, turn out to be benign. The radiologist is trained to see what patterns are worrisome, and what patterns are not.

Its natural to be worried.  For women in your age group, even if it is suspicious enough to go to biopsy, at least 80%of biopsies turn out to be benign.   You are being referred to a breast surgeon NOT because they are planning to recommend a mastectomy, but because breast surgeons are the experts on breast diagnosis.  They are in the specialty that most often sees the correlation between what the symptoms (and/or imaging) is and what the results of biopsy. Biopsy is the 'gold standard' of diagnosis, but an MRI is less invasive.  On the other hand, MRI can have many false positive (show something worrisome when your breast really is fine) results.  They normally can't diagnose you with breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. Anyone in your shoes would be 'in the dark'.  There is little in breast cancer that is 100% accurate.  Your chances are very high that it IS benign.  But, as one author said, if you do feel there is something wrong with your breast, then insist on a biopsy, no matter what the doc says. While there are women here with a lump who have had negative mammograms, ultrasounds, AND MRIs and still ended up having cancer, but this is quite unusual. 2nd opinions are always good.  You can get other opinions.  You may or may not agree with your 2nd opinion.  You can go with the opinion you think is best.  That may be the 1st or 2nd or 3rd, etc. opinion.  I really appreciated getting a 2nd opinion even though I completely disagreed with it.  It spurred me to learn more, and I did. The mean age to get breast cancer is in one's mid-60s.  Of course, women in their 20s CAN get breast cancer, so its good you are getting this checked out.  But your chances are very high this will be nothing.  ",

(Bessie is our resident expert here.) When you look at cells under the microscope, there are some cells that plainly look normal, and other cells that can look plainly cancerous.  But there can also be cells that look somewhere inbetween, and their classification can be controversial. You can certainly skip this paragraph, but it is just written to give you a 'bigger picture': In the case of LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) with nothing worse, its still 'stage 0', but most oncologists do not consider LCIS as breast cancer (in spite of its name.) LCIS was named before they knew its natural history.  In this one study, LCIS women actually had more subsequent invasive breast cancers than DCIS women did.  The study was up to 2001, and there are some big gaps in our knowledge about the treatments and risks that each group had. onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10...     Pleomorphic LCIS, a more recently discovered type of LCIS, has some features of both LCIS and DCIS, and is usually considered a more aggressive type than classic LCIS.  So whether something is considered 'cancer' or not may not correlate with their invasive breast cancer risk. (Women who have a known deleterious BRCA mutation usually have a greater lifetime risk of invasive breast cancer than any benign finding under the microscope.)",

Yes, IDC is the most common type of invasive breast cancer (about 70% of invasive  breast cancers).   The 'runners up' for invasive breast cancer are ILC (invasive lobular carcinoma) at about 15%, IBC (inflammatory breast cancer) at about 5%, and others make up the rest. The most commonly diagnosed noninvasive cancer is DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) at about 85% of noninvasive breast cancers, with LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) roughly 15%.  (Most oncologists do NOT consider LCIS as a true breast cancer, that LCIS was misnamed, and is mainly a risk factor for future DCIS or invasive breast cancer.) This 2005 paper claims Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is mostly diagnosed by mammography. The incidence is between 1% and 5% in countries without widespread use of mammography, but the incidence in mammography screening programs is between 8% and 25%. http://www.springerlink.com/content/q5174604678311n0/ Some doctors define stage 0 breast cancers (DCIS and, to a much lesser extent, LCIS) as cancer, and others do not. (Some define 'cancer' differently.  That's because cancer is 'uncontrolled growth', and you can't see cells growing directly over time on a microscope slide, because the cells you see on a slide are dead cells.  Most breast cancers grow relatively slowly, so even if you could see live cells, it would usually take months to years to see their rate of growth.)  It is usually easy to tell if a breast cancer is invasive or not (if the sample is good), but there can be disagreement in the classification and definition of the noninvasive types and benign breast conditions that put you at higher risk for breast cancer.",

In this study, they took a random woman with breast cancer and a random woman withOUT breast cancer, and compared their modified Gail model score. In other words, for 59% of the randomly se- lected pairs of women, the risk estimated for the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer was higher than the risk estimated for the woman who was not. Unfortunately, for 41% of the pairs of women, the woman with breast cancer received a lower risk estimate than her cancer-free counterpart. Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much......Current breast cancer risk prediction models perform well for populations but poorly for individuals. jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re...  (emphasis mine) An additional comment - some people with ADH opt to have their slides re-read elsewhere to get a 2nd opinion on the pathology.  Not everyone does this, of course.  If you didn't have it read at a major institution, some choose to do this because under some circumstances it can be hard to tell the difference between ADH and DCIS, and they are treated differently.  This is completely optional, but some do choose to do it.",

I had microcalcifications, and was diagnosed with the unusual LCIS and nothing worse.  LCIS is usually considered benign (in spite of the name, no I'm not in denial.) I don't have any personal experience with DCIS.  From what I understand, there are sometimes some situations where mastectomy is recommended for DCIS, such as if you have microcalcifications throughout the breast, or if you have a BRCA or other mutation, or if you have a strong family history with several first degree relatives with breast cancer/ovarian cancer. There may be other situations too, but I'm no expert on DCIS. However, from what I understand, the vast majority of women with DCIS opt for a lumpectomy plus radiation.  In this group of women who had a choice about mastectomy or lumpectomy+rads, about 20% of the group opted for mastectomy.  That means 80% did not.  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18...  In every situation, the choice is up to you. Some women have had multiple biopsies and want to  get off the 'roller coaster' of biopsy. No treatment should be forced upon you. From what I understand, there are enough unknowns about DCIS that often the choice is yours. Someone may strongly advise a certain course, but ultimately the choice is yours. To take an extreme example, there are persons with completely treatable invasive breast cancer with multiple node involvement, for which chemotherapy is strongly advised, who refuse chemotherapy. It is their body and their choice. If you are in a certain situation, we would only hope that you make an informed choice.  For some, that means getting involved in every statistic available, and for others it means asking their closest, most trusted doctor, significant other, and/or friend.  Others choose to explore both ways, or a combination of ways, or some other way.  A big unknown, that no one can tell you, is how much your breasts mean to you/significant others, versus a mastectomy that may, in the long term, save your life in some cases.  Only you can know how you feel, and what each choice would mean to you. We all want to be ready on the path ahead of us so we will be prepared.  Because you do not know what you are dealing with, some prefer not to go there until they know more information about their 'suspicious lesion'. Waiting with the unknowns, from what I understand, is one of the hardest things in this journey.  Hang in there. ",

For me, they injected a local anesthetic into my breast. I think they used a very fine needle, like a TB syringe. The warned me beforehand that if I had any pain, I was supposed to tell them. I had almost no pain on my first core. There are some strange movements of the table, and most of the time you are supposed to lie still. I had a bad time with a wire insertion before my 2nd biopsy, so when they tried to do the initial injection on my 2nd go around, I pulled out of the mammo machine. It was much more from fear than from pain. But some women get wire insertions with no pain whatsoever. It must depend on the person, and if they get near a nerve. Some people, if they have complaints, complain about not being able to move their head or neck or shoulders through the procedure - particularly if they have neck or back issues beforehand. I never had this problem. I would suggest if you are worried, that you have a conversation with the radiologist before the procedure starts on what (s)he wants you to do IF you have pain, and what they will do about it. For me, sometimes there were loud noises, so it was hard to tell when the doc was saying 'breathe' or 'don't breathe' because I was concerned sometimes the 'don't' would get drowned out.

There are several reasons for this, including:  The risk of breast cancer is lower for younger women (as you already know.) Younger women often have denser breasts, so its often difficult to see breast lesions in younger breasts. This is not an 'all or none' statement: some younger women do not have dense breasts, and some older women continue to have dense breasts. From animal studies, there is no 'zero risk' dose of radiation - meaning that even the smallest dose of radiation does have some risk of chromosome damage. However, we all have radiation exposure from our environment.     They do sometimes do  _diagnostic_ mammograms (when there is a known breast sign/symptom) when younger women have breast problems: its a risk -vs - benefit situation.",

I had at least 2 more visits after the excision with her, and she never talked about where she went during surgery. I had 3 more ultrasounds and 2 more mammos before it was determined that the area under the nipple 'may have been mislabeled as scar tissue' and needed biopsy (besides another one for calcs). At that time, the radiologist said he'd talk to the surgeon to find out where she went during surgery. Since the path results were benign, I didn't rate an appointment with the surgeon. I did ask by phone what she thought the lesions were due to, and she said she didn't remember what she did ( understandable -the surgery by then was more than a year previous - but the radiologist said he'd ask her, and that was about 2 weeks before this phone call.) The surgeon said that 'if she saw pulling she would have followed the pulling.\" (I have LCIS, and LCIS women are more at risk for the sneaky ILC than the average woman.) I'm sure she's technically an excellent surgeon, she just doesn't want to share information with patients. This drives me up the wall. I want transparency from my docs. Some people don't want to know, so her style would fit them well. We're all different.",

I do not have this cancer, but this is what I found when I tried to look things up. It sounds like mucinous adenocarcinoma describes only some external features of the cancer.  Adenocarcinoma only means that it starts in glandular tissue - so you can have adenocarcinoma starting in many different organs in your body - that is quite common., Since you are posting on the bc.org site, I assume they found this in your breast. I think that mucinous carcinoma in the breast means that the cancer produces stuff that looks like mucus.  It sounds like its an unusual cancer type, but according to this study, in long-term followup, people didn't do any worse with mucinous cancer than they did with the average type of breast cancer.Your receptors sound good: your cancer is estrogen and progesterone positive.  That means that if you choose, you would be a candidate for anti-hormonal therapy.  This is an addition in your weapons against this disease.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17826073 Her2 zero is also good.  Her2 is associated with a more aggressive type of cancer. I think that ki67 is associated with the number of cell divisions they see, thus associating with how quickly the cancer is growing.  It says fav so I assume this means favorable. p53 is a tumor suppressor.   I don't know about the numbers (possibly each lab has different standards for what the number mean ?) but since it says fav after each of the immunochemistry items, I think that is good news. It is good that your cancer is well differentiated.  That means it is your cancer is closer to 'normal' than some other cancers.  Cancer is a continuum, like temperature.  We can heat up water, but at what point do we call water hot?  So the definition of cancer is not a 'line in the sand'.  But your cancer is closer to a 'normal' cell than a cancer that is 'poorly differentiated'. You are in good company here.  About 70% of the women here who have breast cancer have *NO* obvious risk factors, besides being a woman.  Only about 10-20% of all breast cancers are associated with a single, inheritable gene defect, such as being BRCA positive.  The women here are so supportive.  Feel free to ask questions or vent. I hope someone will be along shortly to add or correct anything I wrote. (I do not have invasive breast cancer.) ",

The estimated lifetime risk has generally been rising gradually since then; this year, the estimated risk decreased slightly. The last five annual SEER reports show these estimates of lifetime risk: 13.4 percent for 1997 through 1999 (\"1 in 7.45,\" often expressed as \"1 in 7\") 13.5 percent for 1998 through 2000 (\"1 in 7.40,\" often expressed as \"1 in 7\") 13.4 percent for 1999 through 2001 (\"1 in 7.47,\" often expressed as \"1 in 7\") 13.2 percent for 2000 through 2002 (\"1 in 7.56,\" often expressed as \"1 in 8\") 12.7 percent for 2001 through 2003 (\"1 in 7.87,\" often expressed as \"1 in 8\") SEER statisticians expect some variability from year to year. Slight changes, such as the one reported this year, may be explained by a variety of factors, including minor changes in risk factor levels in the population, slight changes in screening rates, or just random variability inherent in the data. The estimated probability of being diagnosed with breast cancer for specific age groups and for specific time periods is generally more informative than lifetime probabilities. Estimates by decade of life are less influenced by changes in life expectancy and incidence rates. The SEER report estimates the risk of developing breast cancer in 10-year age intervals (1). These calculations factor in the proportion of women who live to each age. In other words, they take into account that not all women live to older ages, when breast cancer risk becomes the greatest. A woman's chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer is: from age 30 through age 39 . . . . . . 0.43 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 233\") from age 40 through age 49 . . . . . . 1.44 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 69\") from age 50 through age 59 . . . . . . 2.63 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 38\") from age 60 through age 69 . . . . . . 3.65 percent (often expressed as \"1 in 27\") These probabilities are averages for the whole population. An individual woman's breast cancer risk may be higher or lower, depending on a number of factors, including her family history, reproductive history, race/ethnicity, and other factors that are not yet fully understood. To calculate an individual's estimated risk, see the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool at www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ on the Internet. www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/fa... But an article written said the chances of the Gail model, and a model that included other factors such as breast density, predicting one's breast cancer risk **FOR AN INDIVIDUAL** was \"better than a coin toss-but not by much.\" jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re... . They compared one woman with breast cancer to another woman without breast cancer. 41% of the time, the woman without breast cancer had a higher (more risky) value than did the woman with breast cancer.",

I work at the hospital where I had my excision done, and I felt pretty obligated to tell fellow workers what was going on because I was crying every time someone was admitted who had breast cancer. When I cry, my eyes are red and swollen for hours afterwards.   I felt I had to tell them so they would know I was not crying because of something they did. I had my core biopsy that showed nothing worse than classic LCIS.  I had to wait another 1.5 months for a breast excision to confirm there was nothing worse. Little did I know that the night before my excision, a coworker (who I had not told at all), said that the Xray tech (a male, who I had not known at all, but who was friends with a coworker in my department), said, because he had another co-worker who had had LCIS that had bilateral mastectomies, that I should have BPMs too.  That is not what I needed the night before my excision, by essentially a male  stranger I did not know, who was not my doctor.  (BPM was the routine treatment before roughly the 1990s, but is not the routine treatment now unless one has a significant family history or other huge risk factors.)  I also had a very psychologically traumatic wire insertion before my breast excision, which triggered an anxiety disorder. Similar to proudtospin, I did not tell my family until years later, because my sister had an ultimately fatal cancer, and my diagnoses were minor compared to that.  Probably many in my extended family still don't know, but  classic LCIS is quite a minor situation.",

It says that left is about 5% more common than right, except maybe in the upper-outer quadrant, where it was more equal. 1: Cancer Causes Control. 2004 Sep;15(7):637-45. Links Association between breast cancer laterality and tumor location, United States, 1994-1998. Perkins CI, Hotes J, Kohler BA, Howe HL. Minnesota Department of Health, Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System, 717 Delaware Ave., SE, Minneapolis 55414, USA. carin.perkins@state.mn.us OBJECTIVE: Cancer is more likely to be diagnosed in the left breast than the right, but the reasons are undetermined. Left-sided predominance has not been evaluated for some demographic groups or by tumor location. METHODS: Laterality was analyzed among 419,935 incident unilateral breast cancers from 26 population-based cancer registries covering 40% of the US population. Logistic regression assessed the independent contribution of race, ethnicity, age, histology, stage, and location to laterality. RESULTS: Breast cancer was about 5% more likely to be diagnosed in the left breast than the right, a finding that was generally consistent across demographic groups and tumor types. Left-sided predominance was evident among both younger (less than 45 years) and older women, and among men with either in situ or invasive disease. Among women, tumors in the upper-outer quadrant, where one-third of cancers are located, occurred with equal frequency in the left and right breast, while those in the lower quadrants were about 10% more likely to occur in the left breast. CONCLUSION: The observation that the left breast is at greater risk of cancer than the right may not apply to tumors arising in the upper-outer quadrant. The identification of physiologic, pathologic, or immunologic differences between the lower, but not upper, left and right breasts may assist in explaining breast cancer laterality.

Of course, we can't diagnose your sister.   Because she is BRCA 1+, she, of course, is at higher risk.  It may be something to worry about, but it may not.  Women with BRCA mutations usually have breast cancer at an earlier age.  If she feels there is something wrong, then I think she should push for a biopsy for peace of mind.",

There are women here who have had lumps that were not detected by mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI, but ended up being cancer.  This is VERY unusual, but can happen.  The more negative imaging you have the more likely it is to be benign.  For some women, the size that they see on imaging does NOT match what they see when they go in and actually surgically remove the lesion. We have to deal with the imaging we have at the moment.  Hopefully better imaging will be developed in the future, but its not here yet.",

Oh yes, it is very common to get benign results from calcification clusters.  For the overall population, about 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign.  That's a very big number. I had 'suspicious calcifications', and I got LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ, which in spite of the name is usually considered benign.  It is a marker for a higher risk for breast cancer.) Its uncommon, so don't expect that outcome. I know you do not have a common situation because you have had leukemia and a stem cell transplant.  There are several papers about the risk of leukemia AFTER breast cancer, but its hard to find papers about breast cancer AFTER leukemia.  Even so, most of the studies were from leukemia in CHILDHOOD, so these may or may not be relevant. This one says for people who had CHILDHOOD leukemia, the  30-year risk for non-hematological cancers was <3%, and breast cancer was NOT listed in the top 3 cancers. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17505074 So I can't find any Pubmed papers for your SPECIFIC situation. But there is this article on the bc.org site , which says that the 25 year risk of getting breast cancer after hemotogical stem cell transplant is about 17% with radiation, and about 3% without  These are NOT horrible odds.  I know its only one citation. http://www.breastcancer.org/risk/new_research/20080228.jsp The 'lifetime' risk of breast cancer for the average US woman is about 12%.  Now breast cancer prediction is a can of worms.  At this point, this may be too much detail to worry about.  But we don't know whether your risk because of your leukemia is in *addition* to you other known or unknown risk factors.  This means that if you have a risk of 3% from leukemia, and you have a (just making something up here) 10% risk from something else, then your total risk from these two factors may be 3% or 10% or 13% or8%, or even 1% or 25% *for you as an individual*. We don't know because they haven't studied people in your risk group enough, plus statistically there is not enough risk difference between your risk factors and the average risk factors.  If you don't get this, that's OK. The bottom line is that there are a lot of uncertainties in breast cancer prediction.  Hang in there.  I know this is a very scary time for you.  I don't know of 1 person who wasn't scared during this process of diagnosis. Feel free to ask questions or vent.   If you're going through hell, keep going-Winston Churchill",

This Mayo clinic blurb says Most fibroadenomas don't affect your risk of breast cancer. However, your breast cancer risk might increase slightly if you have a complex fibroadenoma \u2014 which may contain abnormal cysts or dense, opaque tissue called calcifications. A pathologist makes the diagnosis of a complex fibroadenoma after reviewing the tissue from a biopsy of the lump. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibr...

You and your daughter are probably NOT describing fungating breast lesions.  While some locally advanced breast cancers present this way in developed countries, it more commonly happens in less developed countries. A fungating (malignant) wound is when cancer that is growing under the skin breaks through the skin to create a wound. As the cancer grows, it blocks and damages tiny blood vessels, which can starve the area of oxygen. This causes the skin and underlying tissue to die (necrosis). There may also be infection. The wounds will often look like a fungus or cauliflower. Other areas of the wound may become ulcerated. Fungating wounds are rare, and most people who have cancer will never develop a fungating wound. They can develop in the area where the cancer started (the primary), or when the cancer has spread to another part of the body (the secondary or metastasis).

The surgeon, with the 'scary things are usually painless' remark, was probably referring to the fact that the most common symptom of a breast cancer is a painless lump.  But breast cancer can present in many different ways: a painful lump, a thickening, pulling of the nipple, no symptoms at all, etc, as you probably know. I don't really understand his 'He also stated the original diagnosis of \"probably\" benign shows the facility is not confident with their diagnosis, and I should keep the 6 month follow up?'.  Perhaps he is convinced it is benign, but knows you are worried so wanted you to get it re-checked in 6 months?  If you are pre-menopausal, then you may want to measure (with a ruler) your lump, and see if the size changes with your monthly cycle. Some doctors, notoriously surgeons, do not have good bedside manners.  (Though I have had several non-breast surgeons who had excellent bedside manners.)  Would you feel better if you got a 2nd opinion?",

IBC tends to occur at a younger age than other types of breast cancer, however, prompting interest in the role of genetic predisposition and early-life exposures.[3]  Rates of IBC increase rapidly up to age 50 and then stabilize. IBC is also more common in African-American women than in White women. http://www.ufscc.ufl.edu/patient/content.aspx?section=ufscc&id=663 Most women who get breast cancer do not have any obvious risk factors (besides being a woman.) IBC is probably one of the 'zebras' of breast cancer.  In other words, its unusual.  If you have a wild animal running around, its more likely a horse than a zebra.   When you have breast symptoms, its easy to go to the 'worst case scenario'.  I am not trying to discount your worry, but its much more likely to be a more common, less aggressive diagnosis.

There can be controversy whether 'uncontrolled' means penetration of the basement membrane (that is beneath the lobules and ducts). There are clearly benign cells, and there are other cells that are clearly cancerous. But there can be controversy over cells that are 'in between'  or  'part of the way there'.  For example, atypical (meaning they are oddly shaped) hyperplastic (meaning there are a lot of cells growing there) cells are thought to be in the middle.  For example, most oncologists consider LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) is benign (in spite of the name). There can be controversy whether DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) and LCIS are considered cancer.  Some people feel 'cancer' should be restricted to invasive types.  (Invasive meaning the cancer has extended beyond the basement membranes.) Some people consider DCIS and LCIS 'pre-cancer'.  Other people consider DCIS (in particular) cancer. (I'm not certain how many experts feel that DCIS is cancer or benign.) DCIS definitely needs to be treated. From what I've heard, its usually easy  for the pathologist to tell if cancerous cells have penetrated the basement membrane. So, normally you can't be diagnosed with cancer before they take a biopsy of a piece of tissue and look at it under the microscope.",

ADH is atypical ductal hyperplasia, a mouthful, but a condition that puts you at higher risk for breast cancer, but is considered benign. Wire guided biopsies are biopsies where they insert 1 (or more) wires to locate a spot. This is so a surgeon can go in and remove the suspicious spot. These are done for mammos and MRIs because they can't have your breast in a mammo or MRI machine while they are doing an excision on your breast. I have had only 1 wire guided excision, and they used 2 wires for this excision. I am so glad you were able to deliver a wonderful eulogy for you mother.

If there isn't enough protein being produced by the liver, then the water in the circulatory system can get 'sucked' into the peripheral tissues (which would include the lungs, often feet/legs/abdomen/etc.) There are probably other ways this can occur too, but this is one way. If it has metastasized into the lung or liver, they may not be able to remove it surgically. I don't know if these cancer metastasize in spots, or if it can be a general spread. If her IBC has spread to the lungs or pleura (the lining of the lungs), then its still called metastasized IBC, and not lung cancer. If she's not tolerating the chemo because her blood counts are too low, then she's probably not strong enough to tolerate major surgery either.   I hope you can talk to the doc soon and get some firm answers so you know what you are up against, and can make some plans.  My best wishes to you in this time.  I know you care a lot about your mother.

Chances this is cancer? That's hard to say. Normally they rate mammograms and MRIs with what is called a BIRADS score. You'd have to see your radiology report to see how they rated it. A BIRADS 4 report has about a 5-95% (yes, that's a big range) of it being cancer; a BIRADS 5 report has about a 95% or more chance of being cancer. You should be able to request a copy of your breast MRI report. The other BIRADS numbers (1,2,3) are for other findings. They normally biopsy BIRADS 4 and 5 reports. (Sometimes they split BIRADS 4 into 4A, 4B and 4C, giving you an idea of which end of the spectrum you are in the 5-95% chance of it being cancer. 4C looks more suspicious for cancer than 4A.) Depending on your age, fibroadenomas (which are benign) are the most common breast masses. (Fibroadenomas are quite common in pre-menopausal women, they are more unusual in postmenopausal women.) Fibroadenomas can grow and shrink (degenerate) over time (commonly over years). Since a biopsy is recommended, I would strongly consider following up on this. Hope you get normal results.",

I am more concerned about MY risk of breast cancer, not the risk of breast cancer of a large group, such as the risk of breast cancer in all women in the USA. In this paper, it points out these are quite different. Most risk factors for breast cancer are quite small. This makes it hard to tell the difference between women with breast cancer and women without breast cancer. With the possible exception of large risk factors, such as being a woman, or a deleterious BRCA mutation, or maybe age or large radiation doses (such as radiation treatment in the chest for people with a cancer like lymphoma), most risk factors are too small to tell the difference between a woman with breast cancer and a woman without breast cancer.

Also you have the experience of seeing what happened to your late husband. No one wants to have concerning lesions, or potentially concerning lesions in their breast, but there can be drawbacks to having everything suspicious excised. Excisions can leave scar tissue, which makes it harder for radiologists to read future mammograms. That means they can miss suspicious lesions in future mammograms. You also cannot always excise all suspicious lesions. I have a rather unusual condition called LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ, which is not normally considered cancer in spite of its name), which does not normally show up on imaging. Normally there are many spots of it in a breast, and its often in both breasts. So, since they have no way of knowing where the LCIS spots are without biopsying them, they often don't (which would be a mastectomy), unless you have other stronger risk factors. When LCIS women go on to get breast cancer in the future, it is often in an area that looks normal previously. They don't know how LCIS confers risk, but some of the breast cancers that LCIS women go on to get are not clonally related to their LCIS. So, if they find something suspicious, you may want to talk with your doctor what they find. You may or may not agree with your doctor, and if you are concerned you can certainly get 2nd opinions. But you also may want to wait to find out what the suspicious areas are, and whether or not they have changed. Many things need to be individualized in breast cancer diagnosis, and one approach does not fit all circumstances.  ",

Its so easy to go to the worst case scenario. But humans are notoriously bad about estimating their risk. Its totally impossible for us to tell you what your results will be. Waiting is awful. But whether your results end up being benign, DCIS, or invasive, there will be people here who have been in a similar position.

Yes, do ask your onc if you should continue to take the bcp.  Note that tamoxifen has different effects on the breast than on the uterus.  Initially, tamoxifen acts like an anti-estrogen on the breast, but acts like an estrogen on the uterus. jjco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re...  When people take tamoxifen chronically until it becomes ineffective, for example in the setting of metastatic breast cancer (not what you have, of course), *sometimes* after a while tamoxifen can start to act as an estrogen on the breast. So it is possible for it to 'switch'. You have a more complex case, though, so I would check with your doc about your bcp use.  I had endometritis (maybe a milder case though) and dysfunctional bleeding.  I stopped about a year before my LCIS diagnosis because the bcp wasn't working.  I've been taking tamoxifen the last 4 years. Some places have tried tamoxifen + (estrogen +/- progesterone) in treatment protocols (for established cancer, not for prophylactic use like you are doing) such as this study. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...  I don't know of any studies doing this for*prophylaxis* only (i.e. for ALH/ADH/LCIS and nothing worse.) Ask your doc about your risk of bc - whether he/she sees a red flag we don't see.  You will get estimates again.  (I have classic LCIS, ALH, AH, radial scar, and nothing worse, with a weak family history.) I have gotten estimates from \"somewhere between 10 and 60% but probably closer to 10%\" to 'about 30%' to 'about 40%', to (from a breast cancer calculator that has NOT been compared to populations, without tamoxifen 85%.  This latter figure, 85%, is undoubtedly wrong.  That's why its important to check the predictions with the specific population that has your conditions.) Note: your pattern of screening may change over time.  I started out with checks every 4 months, and now I'm down to clinical exams every 6 months and yearly mammos. Your screening pattern may depend on your doc or local practice - places do differ. Its good to try to write down all your questions so you won't forget - you'll probably be pretty nervous.  Some people take along a friend/relative/significant other to be another pair of 'ears' in case the doc says something that you don't catch.  Some people ask if they can record the session.  If you  do this, make sure you ask your doc first, and practice with the recorder beforehand.  (Guess how I know?) Let us know how it goes, OK?",

Even if somehow they could magically detect all the ALH and remove it, leaving the 'healthy' portions behind, this would not reduce your breast cancer risk, or at least not by much.  (Since they can't do this experiment, they haven't done it.)  What they have done, is : they have looked at women who started out with a diagnosis of ALH or LCIS , then later got breast cancer.  The places they find breast cancer is often in the places that looked healthy when they did the excision.   Lobular neoplasia is a weird disease. If you are worried about seeding other areas of your breast with surgery, you don't have to worry.  Unlike some other types of cancer, it is thought that breast cancer probably does not seed.  If it does seed, it is quite rare - if you have standard therapy for whatever cancer you have.  Biopsy can dislodge breast cancer cells - but usually the dislodged cancer cells die outside of their 'normal' environment.  Even when they don't, it is thought the stray cells are cleaned up by radiation or chemo or surgery.  So, with standard treatment, seeding in breast cancer is thought to be quite rare. Surgery does have the disadavantage of causing scar tissue,which makes it harder to read mammograms and other imaging in the future.  But roughly 20-30%of the women that have LCIS in a core biopsy have 'something worse'   when they excise the area.  So I think most surgeons do want to excise the area so you can be sure you don't have something else going on in that area. I had LCIS on my core biopsy, and I wanted the area to be excised.  I'm glad I did.",

There is a medical journal editorial here (from 2006) that gives you some clue as to how well the Gail model works for predicting YOUR individual risk of breast cancer. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/98/23/1673.pdf It shows that the Gail model (and an Italian model) worked quite well to predict how many women in a population (of Florence, Italy) got breast cancer.   The models predicted that 180 or 184 women would get breast cancer, and they observed  194.  Very good.  They know how many oncologists they need for breast cancer. But there is another way, also, that cancer prediction models are assessed.  They take one randomly selected person from the group with breast cancer and compare her to one randomly selected person from the group withOUT breast cancer.  So you have 'pairs' of women, and you compare the scores they got from the model. If the model worked perfectly, then in each pair of women, the woman with breast cancer would get a higher score than the woman withOUT breast cancer, and the concordance statistic would be 1.  If the model didn't work at all - half the time the person with breast cancer got a higher score than the person withOUT breast cancer, but half the time the person with breast cancer got a LOWER score than the person withOUT breast cancer, the concordance statistic would be 0.5.   If the model had a concordance statistic of 0, then it would be an excellent model, because it would still predict the outcomes perfectly.  For the Gail and Italian models, the score was about 0.59.  This means that for 59% of the pairs, the woman with breast cancer got a higher score, but in 41% of the pairs, the woman with breast cancer got a LOWER score than the woman withOUT breast cancer.  They described the models as \"Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much.\" Yes, you are at higher risk than the average person to get breast cancer.  You shouldn't miss any screening.  That doesn't mean you are at high risk.  For example, the ACS puts ALH in the category of 'moderate risk'.  www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/con... Before you get too afraid of numbers you see thrown around, you may see numbers like 'ALH carries a 4-5 x normal chance of breast cancer.' (A relative risk of 4-5.)    That is 4-5 x the risk of a woman WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR RISK FACTORS (besides being a woman).   So the 4-5 x is NOT NOT NOT 4-5x 12% the risk of the average woman = some 50-60%. It is 4-5x the risk of a woman without any particular risk factors which is something like 3-5%.  So 4-5 x 3-5 = about 15-25% lifetime risk of breast cancer.   That's using our Gail model predictors -  which are accurate for a particular woman about 60% of the time.   If you had a severe family history of breast/ovarian cancer, then they might be able to predict more accurately because you'd be more likely to have a known BRCA mutation.  Women with a known deleterious BRCA mutation have about a 55-90% lifetime chance of having breast cancer.  There are probably breast cancer genes out there that have not been identified.  But since you have no family history, that's probably not very relevant. **** One thing you may consider doing, if you have not already had this done, is consider if you want to excise the area.   There is some controversy in that decision.  For example http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/breastalh.html I agree with Ginger - its good to get the onc's take on what you should do.  You have a more complex situation since you've been told to continue to take estrogenic hormones for your endometriosis.",

There are lots of cells that look in-between - they have some characteristics of normal cells and some of cancer cells. At your surgical consultation, they will probably evaluate you to see if you need an excision (which means removing the area around the core biopsy - unless you have already had a surgical excision.) They are doing that so they can make sure there isn't anything worse (especially DCIS or invasive cancer) which might be handled differently. Different studies will give different results. There are lots of unknowns, but, for example, in this paper they found that 7% of their group with Flat Epithelial Atypia found either DCIS or invasive cancer. http://www.nature.com/modpathol/journal/v28/n5/ful... . That means that some 93% of their patients did NOT find DCIS or invasive breast cancer. Those are pretty good odds in my book. I had a breast excision after my core biopsy showed LCIS, and they took out about 2 tablespoonfulls of breast tissue. I did have a 'dent', but it filled in over time.",

So you can imagine how much Grandma's sons knew about her breast cancer.   Grandma's sons were not in the least interested in knowing whether or not Grandma was postmenopausal when she got breast cancer.  Grandma died in the 1970s  of an unrelated illness. It ended up that Grandma was in her early 60s when she got breast cancer, so almost certainly postmenopausal. Of course, I can't be sure, but in reading about breast cancer treatment at the time, I think in the 1950s there weren't routine mammograms, so breast cancer tended to be diagnosed at a later stage.  I think it was pretty much thought to be a death sentence.  While there may have been some chemos in research,- though I don't think there were any for breast cancer -  I think its very unlikely she had  any chemos.  I think they routinely did bilateral radical mastectomies at that time even if they found breast cancer in one breast.  I'm not sure of this of course.  I don't think they did much if any radiation, though I may be wrong about that.  I think the main treatment  in the late 1940s/early 1950s were radical mastectomies.   So I think its pretty unlikely that my Grandma had bilateral breast cancer.   The genetics counselor I saw said my risk for having a BRCA mutation was about the same as an AVERAGE  Ashkenazi Jewish woman - roughly 2%.  She said I could have BRCA testing if I wanted to, but my insurance said it wasn't medically necessary. I chose not to be tested - it would be an out-of-pocket expense for me.",

Perhaps the reason why your doc said 2 pathologists have to agree is this:     Usually it is fairly easy to tell invasive cancer apart from non-invasive cancer (i.e. in situ cancer.)  It can be harder to diagnose in situ cancer, and to tell that apart from higher risk benign conditions (such as atypical hyperplasia).   On both my pathology reports, they state that the pathologist double checked with another pathologist.  Almost all breast cancer is diagnosed by a pathologist.  (The type that sometimes isn't is inflammatory breast cancer, and you don't have the symptoms for that.)  No one on this big green earth can tell you your diagnosis for sure before someone looks at your slides.  I know its easy to think that they are 'hiding things from me'. Sometimes they tell you your BIRADS score.  They normally do biopsies on BIRADS 4 or 5 conditions.  www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/... But even if you had a BIRADS score of 5, they still wouldn't know for sure whether or not you have cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. I hope you don't beat yourself up about not having a mammogram for some time.   Most breast cancers have been in the breast for some 6-10 years (not a typo) before they are large enough to be detected by any means.  So most breast cancers are relatively slow growing.

I'm not her, of course, but I would have liked to hear just what you said :-).  So I just let her know that if she ever changed her mind and wanted to talk to me, I'd be here for her. Most people take some time to figure out how they feel.  Most people want a non-judgemental listener. But I would guess that she will only open up to you when/if she feels safe. It can take some time to develop trust. During my diagnosis process, I really regretted telling anyone at my place of work.(I work at the hospital where I get care.)  I initially told people at work ONLY because I was crying at work whenever anyone got admitted with breast cancer, and I wanted my co-workers to know that they had not done anything to cause my red, swollen eyes.  I got unwanted advice (from essentially a male stranger) that I should have bilateral mastectomies, and I had people tell me 'If I was in your shoes I would have done X'  when I had already done Y, which is the opposite of X.   I did NOT find that very supportive, so I told them the subject of my breasts is OFF-LIMITS.  Then later, I had a co-worker (who I had never talked about my medical diagnoses) tell me 'I must be the last one to know about your breast condition but I want to wish you well.'  Gee, I appreciated that too.  Maybe I should wear a sign with my diagnosis. I now am in the process of getting an alias for when I get medical care at my place of work because I'm so angry at many of my co-workers who aren't at all aware about confidentiality.  So I would guess I wouldn't bring up the subject unless she brings it up.  Or, at most, tell her that you are thinking of her, but DON'T pose it as a question that she needs to respond to.  In other words, don't ask \"How are you doing?\"  But something like \"Please know I'm thinking of you.\" would be better.  That way she doesn't have to respond if she feels angry or that you wouldn't understand or something. I'm not very good at relationships, so I'm sure others will have better ideas.",

I do see a therapist, and that's the only way I get hints on how to function properly in society :-) Problem is: we're all individuals.  So what one person wants/needs, another person doesn't.  If she does get bc, then I've read a lot of women here that do NOT want pity.  Now, I know I probably have a different psychological makeup, because sometimes I get so infantile that I do want Genuine (not fake) sympathy.   So I don't Really understand what some posters here mean by pity. Another thing that is almost guaranteed: Please don't say, \"Be positive\".  If you got the worst news you ever had in your life, does it make any sense for you to handle a tragedy by being positive?  But that's part of being non-judgemental I think. There is a whole big thread called The Dumbest things that people have said to you/about you. community.breastcancer.org/for...  - its a huge thread, but maybe you can sample some. You're right- I think people vary a lot in whether or not they want other people to know.  There will almost always be people who will say stupid things to you, and that does hurt, especially at first.   But I think its really good, as you perceived: don't push.  Take the cues from her. She needs to feel whatever she is feeling - sadness, anger, elation, good, bad, whatever.  Let her open up in her own time and own way.  I wish some people at my workplace were as concerned about what they do/say as you are :-).",

I was told 'if you start to have any pain, tell me right away, and I'll stop and inject more anesthetic.\" I was completely stressed out. I think the hardest thing was hearing when he said 'Breathe' versus 'Don't breathe', because sometimes the table would jerk or make noise. The second time I had a stereotactic mammo-guided core, it was a little rougher because I had been traumatized by a wire insertion for excision a year previous where they had not given adequate anesthesia. I freaked out even before they made the first injection - I pulled out of the mammo. I was silently sobbing the whole time. This was all emotional. I think it would have been fine had it been my first core biopsy. The third time I had a ultrasound-guided core biopsy, just under the nipple. I was freaked out about this one too, because I heard its more sensitive around the nipple. But it actually was more comfortable and went quicker than the mammo-guided. I wasn't offered and didn't have any anti-anxiety meds for any of these - I think I could have used some. The mammo-guided ones took about 3 hours and the ultrasound about 1 hr. I got the results in about 2-3 days. For me, a jogbra 24/7 except showering and tiny ice packs were great. I just used the pain meds to try to make me sleep. (I didn't have pain issues, but I had insomnia from anxiety issues.) If you have pain - COMPLAIN! All of my biopsy radiologists were actually quite responsive to my pain and injected more anesthetic right away.",

Some people have a horrible time with tamoxifen, and some people have no side effects.  You can't tell what category you will be in, or if you will be something inbetween. Remember, on any board, people are much more likely to post about side effects of a medication if they are having bad problems than if they are not. Most people who take a medication and have no side effects do not post about that experience.  There are very few medications, if any, that 100% of patients have a particular side effect.  I'm a hospital pharmacist, and one time someone called and told me never to dispense Dilaudid (an opiate) again because it made her pain worse.  I don't doubt her experience, but that is not the experience of most people. I'm not trying to equate the two, but it is possible in some people with some situations to die of drinking too much water. Luckily,one option is that you can start tamoxifen, and if you don't like it you can stop.   Some people find listing the risks in one column and benefits in another column, and comparing the two can helps with their decision.  Not everyone who takes tamoxifen will have strokes or get endometrial cancer, and not everyone who has ADH will get breast cancer.  You have the power to decide.  Its up to you.  Only you can determine how the possibility of stroke or endometrial cancer would affect you.  Only you can determine how the possibility of breast cancer risk reduction would affect you.   Not everyone who takes tamoxifen gets a stroke or endometrial cancer; from what I've read, the incidence of stroke or endometrial cancer  is something like 1% or less.  And some people do have other side effects; I'm not trying to belittle them. We each need to decide what is best for us on our own journey.  My choice may not be your choice.  And that is how it should be.",

(page 1379, bottom).jnci.oxfordjournals.org/conten...   So if you simply subtract the two incidences, you get an excess rate of about 3 excess incidences of cataracts per 1000 women for the women who take tamoxifen. That's a pretty low incidence in my book, but it may not be in yours.  We all have different feelings about what kinds of risks we want to take. I don't know how you feel about this; its your body and your choice.  Many people in the US don't go blind from cataracts - many people have cataract surgery if they have significant cataracts.    You may have a different medical situation too.  You may not be like the people in these studies.  But those are the best numbers I can come up with. You would need to compare this risk to the risk of not taking tamoxifen or doing something different.  Its an individual choice.",

      "Content": "Dec 24, 2010 02:19PM - edited Aug 20, 2013 05:28AM by leaf Well, he's just being thorough.  There is no imaging system for breast cancer that is 100% sensitive and 100% accurate.  This means there is no imaging that picks up 100% of cancers, and only detects cancer and not benign lesions. Ultrasounds are good at detecting cysts, which are a fluid filled sac, and are almost always benign.  Cysts can feel like lumps, especially if they are deep.   MRIs are usually quite sensitive (they pick up most breast cancers), but they also pick up 'junk' that is benign.   Its quite unusual, but there are some posters here who have said they had a lump, but had negative mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs.  When they had it biopsied, it was cancer.  That is very unusual, but can happen.    Depending on your ethnicity, and the medical history of other relatives, you *may* be of increased risk of breast cancer.  Only about 5-15% of breast cancers are thought to be from genetically inherited mutations, and about 70% of women who do have breast cancer have no obvious risk factors (besides being a woman.)  Density is a risk factor for breast cancer, but it must be put into perspective.  Breast cancer prediction for an individual is in its infancy.   For example, the Gail model www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ can give you a number that has 3 significant digits.  It is probably quite accurate in predicting how many women *in a population* will get breast cancer.  However, it is LOUSY at predicting exactly who in that population will get breast cancer.  This older (2006) editorial article in a medical journal says that the Gail model, including other models that add more risk factors - including breast density -  are,for the individuals in this study, \"better at prediction than a coin toss, but not by much.\" jnci.oxfordjournals.org/conten...  While breast density is a risk factor, it only improved the concordance score from 0.58 to 0.66.  This means than when they took a random woman who had breast cancer, and compared her test score to a woman who did NOT have breast cancer, the woman with breast cancer had a higher score only 58% of the time (for a regular Gail score model) or 66% of the time (when breast density, and other factors, were added.)  This means that about 35-42% of the time the woman WITHOUT breast cancer had a higher test (Gail, or Gail + breast density and other factors) score. So biopsy is the 'gold standard' of diagnosis (assuming they sample the 'lesion of concern'.) Except perhaps for inflammatory breast cancer, a person is normally diagnosed with breast cancer by a pathologist who looks at your slides.  Imaging can give you an idea, and MRIs can give you a good idea.  But if you are in doubt, go for a biopsy.  An MRI can give them ideas on where they should biopsy.",

It sounds like fat in breasts can cause 'ghosts' in the image, which makes it much harder to tell what is going on.  I don't know if larger breasts in general are more fatty or not.  The breast shape can make it harder to get good images too, because the magnetic beam is supposed to be at 90 degrees from the lesion in order to get better images.  If you have metal clips still in place from a core biopsy, it could make it harder to read the MRI.  If the magnetic strength of the MRI is <1.5 Teslas, then it can be harder to get clear images, especially with fat saturation.  If the magnetic field is uneven, then you can get 'bad' images.   There are at least 2 ways to get the 'fat ghosts' out: one is fat saturation, and another is inversion recovery imaging.  They each have their advantages and disadvantages. http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/19/2/373.full I think there are many, many settings that can be made on an MRI machine, and some machines are more adjustable than others.  Since MRIs don't use radiation, it may be safer than a mammogram in respect to radiation.  I think some people rarely can have trouble with the MRI dye (gadolinium), particularly if they have poor kidney function. breastcancer.about.com/od/brea...",

Of course, you do need to be seen and go through the testing, but there is NO WAY they can know whether or not you have breast cancer. You cannot be diagnosed with breast cancer (except the rare inflammatory breast cancer, and you don't have the symptoms for that) until a pathologist looks at a piece of breast tissue under the microscope. The average age to get breast cancer is in one's mid-60s. The vast majority of breast lumps in women your age are either cysts (fluid filled sacs) which are NOT malignant, or a benign breast adenoma (which is a benign growth). So, of course, do get all the screening they recommend. You're actually lucky they want you to get through the system quickly. Most women take months to get through the diagnosis process.

(This has nothing to do with the black, white, and gray areas in a mammogram or ultrasound.) Some places have computer assisted mammogram reading, and others have radiologist read mammogram reading.  (I don't know whether computer assisted mammogram readings are double checked by radiologists. I assume so, but I don't know for sure.)  Its very common to have call backs. Sometimes the breast skin folds over in the mammogram machine.  Different radiologists can interpret a mammogram differently.  If there are different software companies making different programs to interpret mammograms, they probably interpret things differently.   Sometimes they want you to come back to see a specific area more carefully - such as 'spot compression', so they can see more clearly.  To give you some idea of what the radiologist is up against, here is a website that shows different mammograms (look at the mammograms near the bottom of the page.) http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/p4793bfde0ed5...  I have 1 friend who has had at least 10 call backs, and has never had a breast biopsy, and is totally healthy breast-wise.   We all wish breast imaging was 100% accurate (picked up every case of breast cancer) and 100% specific (only picked up breast cancer and nothing else). Unfortunately, its not.  I've seen figures thrown around that mammograms are about 80% accurate (they pick up about 80% of breast cancers), and something on the order of <20% specific (usually you have callbacks before they decide whether or not you need a biopsy, and about 80% of breast biopsies overall turn out to be benign.)  This figure can be different in different situations, so, to take an extreme example, if you a postmenopausal woman and have ulcers on the outside of your breast, you are much more likely to have breast cancer than if you are a 20 year old with a breast lump.  So, as you see, we have a long way to go to get to 100% accurate and 100% specific, even with the very best imaging we have. I think most people here wish there was more money spent into better breast cancer detection, and less money into 'breast cancer awareness'. If you have a suspicious mammogram, they will sometimes do ultrasound or other imaging to see if they see anything different there.  Each type of imaging sees something different.  The more 'negatives' (i.e. nothing suspicious seen on a particular imaging) you pile up, the less your chance of having breast cancer.  But you haven't gotten to that point, let alone to a breast biopsy. Second opinions are always fine, but its first good to know why they called you back.  It could have been an equipment problem or placement of your breast problem or a place that is too blurry (in which case I wouldn't get a 2nd opinion), or it could be the opinion of the radiologist (in which case it might be reasonable to get a 2nd opinion.) The important thing is that someone is looking at your mammogram again. Once I had a mammogram and they forgot to put film in the machine.   Of course, its natural to be anxious/angry when they interpret things as one way one time, and another way the next.  It makes us wonder how careful things are being done.  But from what you say, you don't know why you are getting the call backs.  Interpretation of mammograms can be very difficult, and one radiologist may disagree with another.  The more 'double checks' help prevent errors. I am glad they are being careful and calling you back.",

Then the breast surgeon recommends a biopsy.  At my place, the radiologist can't order a biopsy.  I suspect they want several docs involved in case of law suits. Whether or not you have an MRI may depend on your situation.  MRIs are not as invasive as a biopsy, but they are costly, and some insurance companies will not cover them.  So sometimes in the process of getting diagnosed, some people have MRIs and some don't.",

Different studies differ, but the incidence of breast cancer in recently inverted nipple without a breast mass in this group of women many years ago was 5%. None of the women who had breast cancer were under the age of 50.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7069669 In this old study of 3 women with acute inverted nipple, the incidence of something suspicious was 33% - but this was one out of a total of 3 people (not a big enough sample to say anything) and it doesn't say that this one woman was diagnosed with breast cancer. In the 14 women that had nipple inversion during adulthood, two women (14%) had an underlying malignancy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9423612 So, if you are like the women in these studies, your liklihood of having breast cancer is quite low. Waiting is awful, but even in the unlikely chance you have breast cancer, most breast cancer is very slow growing.  They estimate that most breast cancers have been in the body for some 5-8 years (not a typo) before they can be detected by ANY means (including mammogram, lump, etc.) Many women take months to get through the diagnosis process. The fastest I have read here is days, and the longest I've read here is over a year, when the person was mis-diagnosed with some other cancer such as lymphoma.  I think most women take at least a month to get through the diagnosis process.  It took me 3.5 months to go from routine mammogram to getting a written report of my diagnosis. Waiting is awful, but many women find distraction helps.  Let us know how it goes, OK?",

By examining 201 patents by currently available radiation (X-ray, ultrasound, and radionuclide) and pathomorphological techniques, the authors consider that benign diseases (nonspecific mastitis, focal fibrosclerosis, pathological secretion appearing as ductal cysts or papillomas, fibroadenomas, gynecomastia, oleogranulomas) and different histological forms of breast cancer (Paget's disease, infiltrating ductal carcinoma, infiltrating and non-infiltrating lobular carcinoma) result in the retracted nipple syndrome http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17633884 This paper states that Nipple retraction is a common symptom but in the abscence of a mass is rarely due to breast cancer. docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=c... This paper states  Nipple inversion may be bilateral or unilateral and usually results from a benign process that takes place gradually, over a long period (eg, a few years). When nipple inversion occurs more rapidly (eg, within a few months), the cause is more likely to be a malignancy. Additional mammographic work-up is needed in cases in which the history of nipple inversion is not known or in which nipple inversion developed over a short period of time. The additional work-up should include spot compression views with the nipple in profile (to determine whether there is a retroareolar mass) as well as craniocaudal and lateral spot magnification views to assess microcalcifications. If the mammographic views are unrevealing, US should be performed. Reported histopathologic findings in cases of acute nipple inversion with a benign cause include mammary duct ectasia, postsurgical changes (Fig 10), fat necrosis, fibrocystic changes, and Mondor disease (13).http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/27/suppl_1/S65.long I don't know the incidence of many of these benign conditions, but fibrocystic changes are extremely common.   Hang in there.  Its good that you are getting  this checked out (I'm not a physician), but I would guess your chances of having breast cancer are low.",

Many people with Raynaud's wear hats, gloves, and socks most of the time (even indoors).  Some people feel a 'loss of control', so for them it can help to consciously and actively select what to do.  Do what makes sense for you.",

      "Content": "Sep 3, 2010 10:29AM - edited Sep 3, 2010 10:33AM by leaf Thanks for letting us know.  Unless you have a signficant family history of breast cancer, you are probably not considered to be at high risk. Proliferative lesions without atypia: These conditions show excessive growth of cells in the ducts or lobules of the breast tissue. They seem to raise a woman's risk of breast cancer slightly (1½ to 2 times normal). They include: Proliferative lesions with atypia: In these conditions, there is excessive growth of cells in the ducts or lobules of the breast tissue, and the cells no longer appear normal. They have a stronger effect on breast cancer risk, raising it 4 to 5 times higher than normal. They include: Women with a family history of breast cancer and either hyperplasia or atypical hyperplasia have an even higher risk of developing a breast cancer. For more information on these conditions, see the separate American Cancer Society document, Non-cancerous Breast Conditions.  http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/DetailedGuide/breast-cancer-risk-factors Women with some of the breast conditions listed above may be at increased risk for breast cancer. But it is important to keep in mind what this increase in risk really means. For example, a recent study compared breast cancer risk between women with benign breast conditions and those without. The study found that about 5 of 100 women without any benign breast conditions developed breast cancer within the next 15 years. Among women with a benign condition that increases risk 1½ to 2 times, this would mean that about 7 to 10 out of 100 might be expected to develop breast cancer in the next 15 years. Among women with atypical hyperplasia (ductal or lobular), whose risk is 4 to 5 times normal, about 20 to 25 women out of 100 would be expected to develop breast cancer within 15 years. The risk for cancer then declines after 15 years. http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/WomensHealth/Non-CancerousBreastConditions/non-cancerous-breast-conditions-women-at-inc-br-cancer-risk Some of these numbers may be somewhat controversial. In contrast, women with a  deleterious BRCA mutation may have a 60-90% lifetime chance of getting breast cancer.   (I have classic LCIS, ALH, DH (not atypical), radial scar, with a weak family history.   Classic LCIS alone is widely thought to have about a 7-10 times normal risk, and I think the ACS doesn't consider me to be at high risk.  Risk factors are NOT necessarily additive - you may not have higher risk if you have 2 risk factors.  As far as I know, they haven't studied the long term risk of women who have a history of ADH with radial scar, so we probably won't know for some time.) Best wishes to you!",

See what I knew.  I'm sure you know that just having a condition that puts you at higher risk for bc is stressful.   Its natural to want to be ready for whatever is ahead for us.  How else would we have found that its helpful to live in caves - as some protection against saber toothed tigers and mastadons?

They may have something to do with age or trauma. **IF** they end up being associated with cancer, I don't know if they understand exactly why they occur. Plain old arteries that have atherosclerosis can have calcifications all over your body (including your breast). The vast majority of calcifications are benign. Big calcifications are almost always benign. The ones that are more concerning are tiny ones that look like speckles of salt, or ones that look branching. Even if they are suspicious enough to biopsy, remember 80% of biopsies are benign, including biopsies of these 'suspicious' calcifications. They are usually looking for changes in the calcification pattern. So DO get it checked out, worry will not let you miss your biopsy appointment, but know that most of the time these biopsies turn out to be benign. Please feel free to vent or ask questions.",

Now, you do need to understand something about breast cancer prediction. Relative risk is different than absolute risk. Two-fold risk is a relative risk. Relative risk can be a tricky concept, because most people tend to focus on the reported percentage \u2014 e.g., 50% higher risk \u2014 which sounds alarming. Yes, a 50% higher risk of developing breast cancer (relative to people who don't drink) is significant, but it doesn't tell a woman what her lifetime risk is if she drinks two or more alcoholic drinks per day for the rest of her life. Since women in this group have 1.5 times the risk of developing breast cancer, it's necessary to multiply the absolute risk of breast cancer (12%) for women in the general population by relative risk (1.5): http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc... Also, these numbers are for a GROUP of women with this characteristic (in this case drinking 2 or more alcoholic drinks per day). Its not for the INDIVIDUAL woman. We are a LOT less certain about the risk of an individual woman than a group of women (with the same risk factor). https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jnci/djj501 ",

It is awful to think that women your age have to be concerned about breast cancer.  It is unusual in your age group, *but it can happen in your age group.* Lobular carcinoma is  casually known as 'the sneaky one' and often does not show up on mammograms or ultrasounds.  It shows up better on MRI.  Lobular often forms a 'thickening' instead of a lump. Breast cancer *usually* does not cause pain, but there are some women here whose first symptom was pain.  That's why this needs to get investigated.  The more negative exams you pile up, the better your chances of it being nothing, but that is NOT a guarantee.   If you REALLY think there is something wrong with your breast, then insist on a biopsy, no matter what the doctor says.  The only way they can diagnose you with breast cancer is by looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.   MRIs *can* give false negatives, but it is unusual.  In this study, 1 out of 21 MRIs  missed the lobular breast cancer. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800196 and in this study MRI missed 1 out of 29 cases.  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15...  Here are 75 different possible causes of breast pain.  I'm not saying you are a candidate for all 75 of them...http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/breast_pain/causes.htm but it does say there are other possible causes of breast pain too. Get this checked out until you are completely satisfied with the answers.  I know all this uncertainty is horrible to go through.  Feel free to vent or ask questions.",

But I did a survey here, 5 years ago. 38 people responded to my survey.  People were able to choose only one of the 4 following responses. 1) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)   19 people, 50% 2) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  7 people, 18% 3) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  3 people , 8% 4) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10.) 9 people, 24%. I was told 'not to move a muscle' during the procedure (which might have lasted 1-2 hours?)  For me, I had significant pain, but I was determined not to 'be a baby', and didn't say anything.  I knew if I said something I would cry, thus move.  (I also have other psych issues that I didn't know about at the time.) For me, if I ever have to do it again, I will bring something nonverbal (like a bell or rattle) that I can shake if I am in significant pain.  I will let the doc and assistant know what that bell or rattle means before they start with the procedure. As I said, most women have a tolerable time with the wire insertion.  Once an anesthesiologist got involved (for the actual excision- I had to wait several hours as my surgeon had a family emergency), I had absolutely no problem with pain. I don't know if places have changed their course of action in the last 5 years.  I was told that previously our place did not give intravenous anesthesia or sedation for colonoscopies, and after many complaints, they changed their protocol.",

Looking at a mammogram can be something like looking at a clear balloon with printing on it.  If the printing is on the side of the balloon, then its very hard to read.  If there are folds in the breast, it can be hard to read.   Sometimes the breast tissue doesn't lie flat so it can be harder to read.  Sometimes the breast has not been compressed enough (there are techniques such as spot compression) if they want to look at a certain area. Mammograms catch things like calcifications much better than ultrasounds do.  Different types of imaging can see different things.  One type is not necessarily 'better' overall than another.  Ultrasounds are good at seeing fluid filled sacs, such as cysts.   I am not a mammographer or mammography assistant.  But that's about the extent of what I know.",

(Painful lump, painful thickening, painless thickening,  painful breast, something seen on a mammogram but not felt, every other possibility, etc.) But the reverse is not necessarily true.  The benign fibroadenoma is a painless lump, and is far more common than breast cancer, especially in the younger age group.  Cysts can feel like lumps especially if they are deep.  (Cysts are almost always benign.).  Just because you have Suspicious Focal Asymetrical Density does NOT mean you are 'doomed' to have breast cancer.  The overall cancer prevalence among women undergoing biopsy was 22.4%. Prevalence in women with mammograms highly suggestive of malignancy (category 5) was 84.6%, with minimal variation in individual cancer probabilities due to age. A total of 24.6% of women with suspicious mammograms (category 4) had cancer, but individual probability estimates ranged from .01 to .86, depending on age, presence of a lump, previous biopsy, menopausal status, and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15968496 Mammograms can be rated by the BIRADS system.  If you had a high BIRADS score ( category 5), then they'd probably be scheduling you for a biopsy, not a diagnostic mammogram. www.cancer.org/docroot/PED/con...

It can be hard to get pure and specific antibodies.  Antibodies are made out of protein, and they can require very delicate handling.  So different labs can have different values, and probably different batches of antibodies can do different things. The ANA test tests to see if you have antibodies against your  cells' nuclear material.  Your cells' nuclear material means things like the DNA and RNA in your cells. Usually 'average' people don't make antibodies against themselves, but in a small number of 'normal' people, they can.  So it can be a 'normal' condition. But with a variety of conditions, you can have a positive ANA. Crossing my fingers for you for a pain-free rest, and a quick resolution.",

Anyone in your shoes would be scared, no matter how small the risk. Everyone wants to be ready for whatever is on their path.   No one on this big, green earth can tell you for sure whether or not you have breast cancer.  Only the pathologist can diagnose the vast majority of breast cancers.    I have seen several instances of women with BIRADS 5 mammograms (about 75-99% chance of cancer) have benign results. BIRADS is a rating system for mammograms and other imaging.   No imaging is 100% correct in detecting or interpreting the chance of having breast cancer. http://imaginis.com/breasthealth/acrbi.asp Here is a diagram of the breast cancer diagnosis decision tree(from 2001.) (I'd reproduce it here, but the formatting turns out wrong on my computer.)  imaginis.com/breasthealth/diag... Breast cancer is unusual, though possible, in younger women.  The mean age to get breast cancer in the US is in one's early 60s. Even if you have breast cancer, it is not an automatic death sentence. I don't know which doc this was that made this comment, but PCPs and Gyns are not known for their expertise at diagnosing breast cancer from mammograms.  Surgeons, as a group, are not renown for their bedside manner.   Some women here feel distraction helps; some get anti-anxiety meds. We're here for you whatever happens.  ",

I have ALH, ductal hyperplasia (not atypical) and LCIS, and a weak family history. Many authors think LCIS confers a risk of breast cancer about twice that of ADH or ALH.  My breast surgeon refused to consider bilateral mastectomies. At the bottom of this page, they list the usual followup for women with ADH (see the chart) http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/screening/understanding-breast-changes/allpages#422252f8-eeaa-4f03-a4d7-d5f6ce4ce39a With mean follow-up of 13.7 years, 66 breast cancers (19.9%) occurred among 331 women with atypia. RR of breast cancer with atypia was 3.88 (95% CI, 3.00 to 4.94). Marked elevations in risk were seen with multifocal atypia (eg, three or more foci with calcifications [RR, 10.35; 95% CI, 6.13 to 16.4]). RR was higher for younger women (< 45; RR, 6.76; 95% CI, 3.24 to 12.4). Risk was similar for atypical ductal and atypical lobular hyperplasia, and family history added no significant risk. Breast cancer risk remained elevated over 20 years, and the cumulative incidence approached 35% at 30 years.  http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/25/19/2671.full Now, different studies give different numbers, and the Gail risk model (a standard breast cancer risk model) predicts breast cancer in populations well, but not individual risk.  Of course you are scared and anxious.  I don't want you to be this scared and anxious.  But you do want to look at all the risks and benefits.  ",

      "Content": "Oct 14, 2011 04:52PM - edited Oct 14, 2011 04:58PM by leaf Well, my answer will be more complicated than I wish. Different doctors classify things differently.  For example, all docs that I know of classify invasive breast cancer as cancer, but some classify DCIS as breast cancer, and some not.  Few oncologists classify LCIS as cancer, though some do.  So there can be controversy over the classification of things. From what I understand you had ALH (and borderline ADH) on your core biopsy.  They are not doing the excisional to remove the ALH; they are doing the excision to see if there is something worse going on  in the area.  (Something worse would be LCIS, DCIS, or invasive breast cancer.) The chances of finding something worse on your excisional is something like 20% (different studies differ, but most are in the range of 10-35% or so.) When someone gets ALH on a needle or core biopsy, its totally usual treatment to get an excision. DCIS (with nothing worse) is about 7 times more common than LCIS (with nothing worse).  ALH is like LCIS except less advanced.  (I have classic LCIS, ALH, sclerosing adenoma, and ductal hyperplasia (not atypical ductal hyperplasia.) ) If you do have DCIS, they normally try to remove all of the DCIS.  That is not the case with LCIS.  That is because if one spot of LCIS is found in a breast, there are often multiple spots of LCIS in that breast, and often more spots of LCIS in the opposite breast.  Almost everything about LCIS is controversial (including the name), partly because its so much less common than LCIS.  In this paper, for the LCIS or DCIS women, if you add the risks of both breasts together, LCIS women had a higher risk of subsequent breast cancer than did DCIS women (both with 'usual treatment'  but not mastectomy.) onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10... I'm not sure what you mean by 'a lot of times I am reading is that most cancers are found before they get to the point I'm at.' After ALH on a needle or core biopsy, its totally common to get an excision so they can double check that you don't have LCIS,DCIS or invasive lurking around.",

ALH and LCIS (also known grouped together as lobular neoplasia) are excised NOT in order to remove the lump or lesion that prompted the needle or core biopsy.  They are NOT excised in order to remove the ALH or LCIS. They are removed because about 20% of the time they find LCIS (which would put you at higher risk of breast cancer in the future), or DCIS (which is usually treated differently than LCIS) or invasive (which, depending on the size, aggressiveness, 'personality'), may be treated differently than LCIS or DCIS.  Again, as in all things concerned with lobular neoplasia, there is controversy. (There is controversy about whether or not to excise ALH/LCIS.)   It was only several years after my excision (I told the breast surgeon to 'get it all out', not knowing the implications at the time), I was told by my 2nd opinion at a NCI certified breast center that I had 'too much scar tissue <from this, my only excision> to get an MRI.'  I have yet to get a breast MRI. Again, I have LCIS, ALH, and ductal hyperplasia (not atypical).  Classic LCIS is usually considered to have about twice the risk of subsequent breast cancer as ALH. Would I choose an excision again under the same circumstances?  Yes, but I may not tell the breast surgeon to 'go all over my breast'.  (I had scar tissue inches away from my incision site, as proved by a subsequent breast biopsy.)  But some people choose NOT to get excised. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21... http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21306860 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19667411 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18...

Here's more about mucin from wikipedia. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucin Mucin is an unusual condition (in this case 0.51% of biopsies.) This is one author's opinion (2002) Lesions of the breast containing extravasated mucin span a continuum from benign mucoceles to invasive mucinous (colloid) carcinoma. <snip>Mucinous lesions were identified in 22 cases (0.51%), and excisional biopsy material was available for 15 of these. At excision, 0 of 8 benign mucinous lesions showed carcinoma, while 7 of 7 mucinous lesions associated with carcinoma at the time of core needle biopsy showed carcinoma at excision. The vast majority of mucinous lesions of the breast can be diagnosed accurately by core needle biopsy. Whether all such lesions require excision is not known at this time.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12109860 Another author agreed that mucin is associated with a variety of conditions, and it is unusual. They constitute a wide spectrum of lesions ranging from extravasated mucin associated with fibrocystic change to mucinous carcinoma.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... Calcifications are very common, and usually associated with benign conditions.  But some patterns of calcifications can be more worrisome.  Here may be more than you ever wanted  to know about calcifications. http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4793bfde0ed53 I can't find any academic papers that actually look at the group of women with ADH AND extravasated mucin AND calcifications.  The ADH, as Anne said, puts you at somewhat higher risk for bc. Since we don't know why some cells produce mucin (as far as I know), we don't know if the mucin signifies anything.  Since it is associated with everything from perfectly benign conditions to cancerous condtions, it is probably NOT a 'red flag' for anything.  Its just unusual.",

(I have so much problem getting on one that you have to pull on over your breasts. My breasts hurt when they jiggled or moved.) b) tiny ice packs. I wrapped mine in a cloth, and for me they were better than pain meds to ease the 'zingy' sensations. c) I couldn't take off my dressings for a few days, so it was convenient to have some large plastic bags to tape on my chest to try to keep them dry when I showered. I went to work 24 hours after I came out of the recovery room. Some people needed several days-week. Different people's experience is different, and people have different amounts of tissue removed in their excisional. I didn't jog for about a week.

Breast thicknesses can be tricky, so your regular doctor is being through in sending you to a surgeon. That doesn't mean that you have breast cancer; that just means you're going to someone who is more specialized in diagnosing breast conditions. In this one study in the UK, women who were <40 years of age with a breast thickening and, (assuming you would count a breast thickening as no lump size), had a score of 2 thus a probability of breast cancer of less than 5-8%. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC308022... This was a relatively small study, of 802 patients, of which 59 (7%) were diagnosed with breast cancer. Overall, about 80% of women who get breast biopsies have benign results, and your surgeon has not decided whether or not your symptoms are suspicious enough for a breast biopsy. Even if you were at higher risk, it still would be a good plan to try to relax, since worrying won't change the outcome, and just makes it harder on you. Let us know how it goes, OK? ",

Its harder with your first mammogram because they don't have anything to compare it to. If this was your 2nd mammo, they could compare it to the first, and they would be looking at changes. I know its maddening, but they tend to interpret breast imaging with very concrete terms. In other words, if there is a density, that means there is a place on the mammo that shows there is more tissue in that place (as opposed to fat) in that place. Younger women (and 41 is considered relatively young in this game) tend to have denser breasts, but some women have dense breasts throughout their lives. Dense breasts means its harder to read mammograms on them - its harder to see through the breast, so its easier to miss things. Ultrasound 'lesions' tend to be described as a 'hypoechoic' place. This means that it looks like the sound waves (the ultrasound waves) didn't bounce back as much in that area. That's all it means. They can't tell, of course, for sure whether or not any of these lesions are any thing to worry about. MRIs tend to give a lot of false positives-they show lots of things including inflammation - things that are NOT cancer. I am sure they do not have the manpower and resources to biopsy every small lesion - even those that seem normal- that is seen on mammogram. Some lesions are more suspicious than others. If it was quite suspicious, then they would be ordering a biopsy right off the bat. My ultrasounds cost on the order of $100-200 each, and my mammo-guided stereotactic biopsy cost my insurance company about $3500. (This was much less than what my insurance company was charged.) My excision (for an excisional biopsy) cost $13.5K (paid by the insurance company, not what the hospital charged the insurance company.) So they aren't cheap.",

Unfortunately, the only way they can tell for sure is to take a piece of tissue and look at it under the microscope. The report just states objectively what they see on MRI.  (The only 'evaluation' was the BIRADS 0 notation, which means that more imaging is needed for evaluation.)   As Anne says, MRIs show a lot of stuff that ends up being benign.  The location (near your chest wall) does NOT mean that lesion is more likely to be cancer;  it would be difficult/impossible to biopsy by MRI.   When I had my wire insertion for my excision, a friend of a colleague had a wire insertion for excision that was right against her chest wall; it ended up being totally benign (not even high or medium or low risk.)   Some of the things that the MRI is seeing may also be inflammation/scar tissue from your previous biopsy. It took me 3 months to get through the diagnosis process- for some people it takes 4 or 6 months.  Some people ask to be called in case there are cancellations and are able to get in earlier. There are people who have negative mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs (but still have a palpable lump or thickening) but still end up having breast cancer.  That is quite unusual but can happen.  So ultrasound can help clarify whether your lesions are worrisome, but no imaging in the breasts is 100% accurate or 100% sensitive.  I wish we had better imaging, but for now we have to go with what we have. Hope you get news soon and can get this resolved.  Its so hard going through this diagnostic process!",

Breast size changes during weight changes.  Breasts commonly get bigger when women take estrogens, or have hormonal changes. I don't know how old you are, but unless you are extremely young, it may be good to get baseline mammos and ultrasounds, so they have something with which to compare. This may be a controversial issue.  Here is one recent study.  www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/ar...  Other studies or doctors may have other opinions.",

Ultrasounds are better at picking up cysts (which are almost always benign), and ultrasounds are not known to be associated with causing cancer.  Ultrasounds  of the pelvis are routinely used in pregnancy to look for problems with the baby or placenta.  Breast cancer is extremely uncommon in teenagers, as the other posters have said, but its good to get it checked out.   As the others have said, telling your mom you are concerned is the first step.",

The most used breast cancer risk model is the Gail model.  http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ Different studies will give you different numbers. Know that when they say 'you have risk 5 times higher',this does NOT mean 5x the risk of an AVERAGE woman (i.e. is NOT NOT NOT 5x13%=65%; 13% is the lifetime risk of breast cancer for the 'average' US woman), but 5 times the risk of a woman WITHOUT any particular breast cancer risk factors (besides being a woman).  There are different figures for this,but they usually range a lifetime risk of about 3-5%.  So 3x5=15% lifetime risk, and 5x5=25% max. This study found ALH gave more of a risk than ADH in premenopausal women. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... In this small study that included ADH women, their risk of breast cancer over 5 years was about 5%. These results support current literature showing the synergistic increase in risk for patients with ADH, LCIS, and a positive family history of breast cancer. Obesity was also a strong predictor of breast cancer risk, which suggests that there may be a potentiating effect of obesity on other risk factors. Obesity may represent a modifiable risk factor, providing women with an opportunity to reduce their risk with lifestyle modification. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or a diagnosis of ADH or LCIS may benefit most from risk-reduction strategies, chemoprevention, and surveillance.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez Our population included 1,412 high-risk women with median follow-up of 4 years. Of 195 women < or =35 years, 3 (1.5%) developed breast cancer. All three had strong FHBC and none had a prior high-risk lesion. Of 82 women > or =70 years, 6 (7.3%) developed breast cancer. Mean Gail score for women > or =70 years was 4.3, as compared with 4.7 in the subset of older women diagnosed with cancer. Fisher's tests demonstrated that ADH (p = 0.15), ALH (p = 1.0), LCIS (p = 1.0), and FHBC (p = 1.0) were not associated with breast cancer development in older women. We conclude that, for women < or =35 years, a significant FHBC may be a stronger predictor for breast cancer development than high-risk lesions. For women > or =70 years, FHBC and history of ADH, ALH, and LCIS were not predictors of breast cancer. This study emphasizes the importance of defining age-appropriate recommendations for breast cancer risk management, including surveillance and chemoprevention.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18... The Gail model is quite good at predicting the breast cancer risk for USA  populations (for example, how many women in a group of women will get breast cancer), but it is quite poor at predicting which PARTICULAR women will get breast cancer. In this 2006 medical journal article, they compared the Gail model  to an Italian model (which included other factors like breast density).  They took one randomly selected woman who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and compared her initial model score with a  randomly selected woman who had NOT been diagnosed with breast cancer.  If a model was 100% accurate, her concordance value would be 1:in each pair, each woman with breast cancer would get a higher score than each woman without breast cancer.  If the model was as good as chance, the concordance value would be 0.5, meaning in 50% of the pairs, the woman with breast cancer would get a higher score than the woman without breast cancer,but in 50% of the pairs, the woman WITHOUT breast cancer would get a higher score.  In other words, if you have a model with a concordance value of 0.5, the model isn't a good predictive model. Decarli et al. also assessed each model\u2019s performance at the level of the individual woman. A model that discriminates well at this level should consistently predict a higher risk of breast can- cer for women who will be diagnosed with the disease than for women who will not. Decarli et al. randomly selected pairs of women, one of whom was diagnosed with breast cancer and one of whom was not, to determine the frequency with which each model calculated a higher risk for the woman who developed breast cancer. The resulting calculation produced a concordance statistic, whose value could range from 0.50 (equivalent to a coin toss) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination). The concordance statistics for the Italian and Gail models were essentially the same, ap- proximately 0.59 (with 95% confidence intervals that ranged from 0.54 to 0.63). In other words, for 59% of the randomly se- lected pairs of women, the risk estimated for the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer was higher than the risk estimated for the woman who was not. Unfortunately, for 41% of the pairs of women, the woman with breast cancer received a lower risk estimate than her cancer-free counterpart. Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much. jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re...  (emphasis mine). If it is this difficult to predict breast cancer risk for an 'average' woman, think how much we know about women with increased risk. This can make it difficult to decide what to do based on numbers. The server went down, so I can't search for more. There is no rush what to do.  Visit both your brain and your heart, (and your insurance) to see what path you want to take.",

Microcalcifications are small calcifications.  These can sometimes be associated  with cancer cells, but often they are not.  As far as I know, we don't understand why these small calcifications are associated with more/faster cell growth.  Calcifications have nothing to do with how much calcium you eat.  Here is an excellent website, probably more than you ever wanted to know about calcifications. http://www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4793bfde0ed53 Columnar cells are just part way between normal cells and your atypical cells.   These cells do not put you at a  reliably measurably higher risk of breast cancer. surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/... The atypical ductal hyperplasia means you have more cells lining your duct (hyperplasia), and the cells have irregular shapes; often the nucleus looks abnormal.  Its the atypia that puts you at somewhat higher risk of breast cancer. surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/...",

As always, there are very few things that are 100% in breast cancer. Ultrasounds are cheaper and less invasive than MRIs. MRIs can show a lot of false positives. The only way they can really diagnose breast cancer is through a biopsy. But they can't biopsy every part of everyone's breast. So they need the imaging (or presence of a lesion.) Even with a birads score of 4, about 80% of biopsies are BENIGN. I know its hard not to go to the worst case scenario. But your chances are excellent that things will turn out fine.",

In more simplistic terms, the answer to your question is probably no - if an aunt with breast cancer is all the breast and ovarian cancer in your family history, then that is considered probably a weak family history, and people like you in a group (ADH) may have a lifetime risk of roughly 15-25%.   Remember, some 13% of women in the USA  will get breast cancer some time in their lifetime.  I had a grandmother with breast cancer and an aunt with breast cancer (on opposite sides of the family, both after the age of 50) and my genetic counselor estimated my risk of having a BRCA mutation was about 2-4%. It is thought that no more than about 10-15% of breast cancers are due to a single inherited mutation (such as BRCA).  The other 85-90% of breast cancers are thought to be 'sporatic', due either to multiple gene effects, or environmental or other effects.  It is thought that about 70% of breast cancers in women have no obvious known cause, besides being a woman. Your family pattern probably does not meet  the recommendations made by the US preventative task force for BRCA testing:  These family history patterns apply to about 2 percent of adult women in the general population. Women who have none of these family history patterns have a low probability of having a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/fa... This does not mean it is impossible for you to have a deleterious BRCA gene mutation; it just means it is highly unlikely. There are families with a strong pattern of breast cancer (for example, multiple people in each generation with breast cancer), and they test negative for BRCA.   But one aunt with breast cancer and no ovarian cancer is NOT a strong family history. There are almost certainly unknown breast cancer risk genes out there.  But there are no genetic tests in the general population out for them yet.",

In it, you see 34% of the biopsies were generated for birads4 score. J Am Coll Surg. 1999 Jul;189(1):34-40. Links Positive predictive value of the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System. Lacquement MA, Mitchell D, Hollingsworth AB. University of Oklahoma Institute for Breast Health, Department of Surgery, Oklahoma City 73104, USA. BACKGROUND: The American College of Radiology has established guidelines for outcomes monitoring known as the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS). These recommendations include calculation of positive predictive values (PPV) and tracking of both benign and malignant histology. We collected this data for 688 radiographically guided biopsies and organized it according to the BIRADS assessment categories. The objective was to evaluate the contribution of the BIRAD System when used to stratify PPV, histology, and biopsy modality data according to the overall assessment rating. STUDY DESIGN: This study included data from 688 image-guided biopsies. Mammographic studies were either assigned a BIRADS rating at the time of examination or, if the image was taken before our use of BIRADS, examined retrospectively and rated. In these retrospective cases, the histologic outcomes of the biopsy remained unknown to the radiologist until ratings were assigned. Positive predictive value was calculated for each BIRADS category. RESULTS: The overall PPV for the sample was 0.23. The PPVs increased with increasing level of suspicion as follows: category 1 (0.0), category 2 (0.04), category 3 (0.03), category 4 (0.23), category 5 (0.92). Category 1 lesions represented 0.1% of the biopsies; category 2, 3.6%; category 3, 46.8%; category 4, 34.0%; and category 5, 15.4%. The most common histologic diagnoses of benign lesions biopsied were fibroadenoma and fibrocystic changes-proliferative and nonproliferative. The most common histologic diagnoses of malignant lesions biopsied were infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ. Utilization rates of the biopsy techniques varied by BIRADS category. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that BIRADS does improve the quality of the risk assessment information by making the PPV more specific to a patient's mammogram rather than simply related to an overall PPV. Our histology analysis showed category 3 and category 4 benign biopsies were predominantly because of fibrocystic changes. Category 5 lesions were predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma. Analysis of biopsy modalities indicated the preferred method for management of radiographically detected lesions evolved from stereotactic core biopsy to directional, vacuum-assisted biopsy over the course of the study.

It would have taken just as much time to say something like \"I'm sorry you are going through this. I'm not allowed to give you the diagnosis, but I'll try to get you the first appointment I can with the doctor so you can discuss it with him/her.\" She must do this hundreds of times, and chose a position with a lot of people contact, so she should be able to get it right.

Some people feel anti-anxiety medications help.   You can promise yourself a big reward after you have your mammogram.  Just for showing up.  Some people would say to themselves something like 'I am giving my body what it needs to be healthy.'  It is your choice what you want to do.  Be healthy, whatever you decide.",

But you see in this poll that over half of the people (58%) had a pain of <=4/10.  I wasn't one of them, but I didn't have injectable anesthesia beforehand either, like Marin. In addition to Marin's wise words, I would add: if I was going to do it over again, I would also clear with the doc how I was supposed to communicate with him if I had pain.  They tell you 'not to move a muscle'.  For me, personally, I knew if I would have said I'm in pain I would have cried, and if I cried I would have moved. (People are different about this, of course.)  I would have preferred a nonverbal cue, such as ringing a bell or dropping something on his foot.

So, depending on your circumstances, you may or may not be able to have chemotherapy or radiation.

I think that in most places they have radiologists do mammo-guided, ultrasound-guided or MRI-guided biopsies.  Surgeons (breast or general) do surgical excisions. Radiologists normally do the biopsy via the imaging where you see the 'lesions' better.  (In other words, where the abnormality is more prominent.  If they see the abnormality better via ultrasound, then you have an ultrasound-guided biopsy. ) I'm not sure what you are having (biopsy vs surgery/excision) since you say you went to pre-surgery testing, and ask about MRI biopsies.  (I've not had a breast MRI so I don't know if they do pre-proceedure testing for the MRI dye to check your kidney function?  Maybe others know the answer to this.)   I have not had an ultrasound-guided surgical excision, but when I had a mammogram-guided surgical excision, they first put wires in (while having the mammogram) to 'bracket' the area, so the surgeon knew what to excise.  If you have a suspicious lump and are getting a surgical excision, and the surgeon can feel the lump, the surgeon doesn't need an MRI or ultrasound  or wires to know what to excise.

She says what distinguishes it from an infection is that it does not get better with antibiotics.   She says that \"Anyone with a breast infection that persists after 10-14 days  of antibiotics should see a breast surgeon, who will probably want to do a biopsy.\" She says IBC is rare, occurring in about 1-4% of breast cancers.   She says what the tip-off is that after being put on antibiotics, it doesn't get better, and it doesn't get worse.    She says if the symptoms continue after treatment, then ask to have a biopsy done of the breast tissue and the skin itself. In inflammatory breast cancer, you have cancer cells in the lymph vessels of the skin, which is what makes the skin red; the cancer is blocking lymph fluid drainage of the skin.  Maybe you should ask the doc to ask whether or not it was adequate to detect IBC?  I do not know enough about IBC to know if it occurs throughout your entire breast, and whether they can 100% rule out IBC from that biopsy.  Was your surgeon a general surgeon or a breast surgeon?",

DCIS is usually thought of as a precursor to breast cancer. Here's a paper that supports what traveler said for BIRADS 4. \"The prospectively classified BI-RADS 3/4/5 findings revealed a malignant histology in 5.9%/17.6%/90.9% of all lesions, respectively\" http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16392601 I had a Birads 4 mammogram too.  I ended up having LCIS and ALH (and nothing worse.)  Don't expect this as it is quite unusual.  I got excised after the biopsy, not in order to remove more LCIS, but to make sure there wasn't anything worse going on. LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ) (in spite of the name) is normally considered a benign condition, that puts you at higher risk for breast cancer.  Even if you have 1 spot in 1 breast, it puts both breasts at risk.  Its a weird condition. Most calcifications, and most microcalcifications end up being benign.  I googled microcalcifications when I was waiting for my biopsy, and was very upset.  I didn't know the 'big picture'.  If you just have microcalcifications, then most of the time, as traveler said, it is usually very early stage, often DCIS.

One is much more life threatening than my LCIS, and has an incidence of some 5-20:1 million. My best friend, who had no (zero,zip- not even weight or high blood pressure) medical problems whatsoever before her pancreatic cancer diagnosis last February, died last month at the age of 59.  Its the first time I've seen death up close and personal.  She did NOT want to talk about how she felt. I'm agnostic, so prayer or religion isn't for me.  (There is a thread about atheists with BC in the Just diagnosed or the Getting through Treatment forums.) Well, I've been in therapy since my LCIS was verified, and that has helped.  (I was told I have 'something like' PTSD.)  I had some biofeedback training, which has helped.  I've had trauma issues from when I was a very small child.  I didn't even know they were traumatic until my LCIS diagnosis, some 50 years later! But we all have different personalities, so our ways of coping will be different. Sometimes you just have to laugh, because if you don't you would cry. (and I do that too.) There are some people who get diagnosed with dreadful conditions  (like really strange cancers) where there have only been a handful of cases in the literature. They don't know how to treat them or what their prognosis might be.  Just think of how they feel.  I mean, somebody has to be that handful.   Health is not distributed equally or fairly.  There is no \"Just World\".  It would be a lot less chaotic if the world worked and 'we got what we deserved'.  Sometimes it works that way, but often it does not. For myself, all I can do is to try to be more kind.  Someone here has the signature that goes something like \"Be kind to everyone because you do not know what trials they are going through.\" I can't be kind to everyone (I have some difficult issues), but I can try to improve myself. I know that I spend a lot more time on this board than the average person - I want to 'save the newbies'.  I mean, I never got my Holiday cards written!",

In other words, I have classic LCIS, but many places do NOT categorize me as being a 'high risk woman'.  There is a lot unknown about LCIS, but most people estimate my lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 25-40%.  This is more than the 'average' woman's lifetime risk of about 13%. Even known breast cancer risk conditions such as having LCIS or dense breasts do not get the risk curves different enough to be able to separate the people who will or won't get breast cancer. (LCIS is thought to be one of the largest non-cancerous breast cancer risk conditions that can be seen under the microscope.  Certain deleterious BRCA mutations are thought to have up to a 95% lifetime incidence of breast cancer, and I don't know what the rate is for Hodgkin's disease survivors, but its probably higher than the numbers that are usually tossed around for LCIS, about 20-40%; my 2nd opinion said 10-60%, but probably closer to the lower end of that than the upper end.) They can link many factors with increased breast cancer risk - but these are *in populations*.  In other words, they might know that more cases of breast cancer are found in a population with risk factor X.  But predicting WHICH of these individuals in this group with risk factor X will get breast cancer is a whole different ball of wax.  For more complex statistical information, you may want to check out this editorial in a peer-reviewed medical journal.  http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.full.pdf",

On a subsequent biopsy, I asked specifically if the pathologist would address the question if any hamartomas were seen (PTEN, or Cowden's syndrome is also known as a hamartoma syndrome.)

I also heard of several people here who got very warm support from their co-workers and community, so I thought it would be OK. I dropped my mammos off at the radiology dept, and the  clerk, Tommy, said 'Ohhh-LCIS', and I just glared at him.  He knew someone in my dept, but I had only met Tommy once before about 20 years ago and exchanged maybe a total of 5 words with him decades ago. The night before my excision (I work the graveyard shift), a co-worker said to me, \"Tommy wishes you the best of luck on your excision, and recommends that you have bilateral mastectomies because he had a co-worker who had LCIS and that's what she did.\"  I replied, \"Well, that takes a lot of audacity.' I did not appreciate essentially having a male stranger tell me I needed to have bilateral mastectomies, in the middle of work, I didn't bring up the subject, and Tommy wasn't a doctor, let alone my doctor. I had a difficult time with needle insertion before my excision, which ended up triggering a previously undiagnosed PTSD-like condition.  I wasn't able to tell the doctor during my needle insertion, because they said I must not move a muscle, and if I had told him I would have cried, and if I cried I would have moved.  It did not help when people in my department told me they would have told the doc.   I even had one co-worker (who I had not told) 'I must be the last person to know, but good luck with your breast problems.\"  I told everyone the subject was off-limits. When I got a more serious diagnosis, I have told some trusted people at work, but swore them to secrecy, as in 'I will personally boil you in oil if you spread this around.' Perhaps I would have felt differently about things if I did not have an underlying PTSD- like condition, if my medical information was held in confidence, if I had gotten respect for my reaction to my situation, etc.   But once people know, they will not forget it.  At least someone will make stupid comments to you.  You may or may not have tough enough skin for that. There has been at least one person here whose boss did not hire her back after her surgery due to some things she said before her mastectomy.  I'm sure its not supposed to happen, but some people do not act kindly when people have problems with their sexual organs. So lots of things come into play - the seriousness of your condition, your work situation, your boss, your career, your family, etc.",

But the genetics counselor gave me a paper that said at that time, there was about a 25% lifetime risk of bc from the Cowden's.  I had already been diagnosed with LCIS. From the little I know of DCIS, I completely agree with Bessie's post.  DCIS needs to get treated.  I highly doubt if we know what the lifetime risk of invasive bc for someone with DCIS (appropriately treated) AND Cowden's really is.  In other words,  you need to get appropriately treated for the DCIS.  Cowden's may or may not give you additional risk (beyond that of appropriately treated DCIS.)  for more DCIS or invasive..  I bet there are no studies.  In other words, to echo Bessie, do make sure you are getting appropriately treated for your DCIS.

Cysts (fluid filled sacs) are normally easily detected by ultrasounds. They didn't describe this as a cyst in the report, so its probably not a cyst. They probably want to wait 2 weeks for another breast exam because if a lump expands *and shrinks* during a woman's menstrual cycle, its almost certainly not cancer - cancer means uncontrolled growth.  If a woman has cancer, its not going to shrink unless its treated. No one on this Earth can tell you 100% whether or not you have breast cancer.  Almost all breast cancer is diagnosed by a pathologist looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.The more negative imaging you have, the more likely it is that you do not have breast cancer. Most breast cancers have been in the breast for some 4-8 years before they can be detected by ANY means. There are some women here who have had negative mammograms, ultrasounds, and MRIs, but ended up having breast cancer.  This is unusual, but can happen. Our imaging is not 100% specific or sensitive. Its the best we have.  But, overall, particularly for younger women like you, about 80% of biopsies are benign.  You may see posts from women who had negative imaging results, but, remember, this is a breast cancer support group.  Most women who get negative results do not continue to post here and go on with their lives. I know its hard to make decisions about your health when you have no expertise in making these decisions.  Unfortunately there is little in breast cancer that is 100% anything.",

(Don't expect LCIS; its unusual.)  Your chances are by FAR - that your results will be benign. Here's a website about breast calcifications, so you can see some pictures of what they might be worried about. www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4... No matter what the outcome of your tests, there will be plenty of people here who have been in a situation similar to yours.  But remember, most of the people who keep posting are people who have breast cancer, usually in active treatment, or are caring for people who have breast cancer.  The people who have benign results usually don't continue to post here.  So if you look at the numbers of people who post, you will get a distorted view.",

Its certainly possible to have lymph node lumps/swellings from different causes.  A friend had an armpit lump removed and it ended up being from a fungal infection she probably got when she was tending her roses.   Regular infections can cause lumps in the armpit and clavicle. Here's more on armpit lumps from the NIH. www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/en... including some of the possible 'next steps'.  There is a USA national program that helps with mammograms, but I think you have to have no insurance.  They can cover breast cancer treatment, too, but you have to be diagnosed under their program also, from what I've heard. http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/",

I thought the only women who got breast cancer were women who ignored their lumps. (I didn't have a lump.) I was wrong about that. I certainly didn't understand the terminology, and the rapid-fire contacts I had made me anxious. That's why I found bc.org so helpful- you can get so much useful information here. I'm not sure what he meant by 'if the biopsy was normal he would continue to look for something else'. There are 4 main kinds of biopsies a) Skin punch - usually for inflammatory breast cancer or other skin related conditions. (You don't have any of the symptoms for this.) b) Fine needle biopsy - can often be done in a doctors office. Can only be done on palpable lesions, and sometimes can miss the desired spot. Can distort the tissue, making the diagnosis more difficult. Easy to do. c) Core needle biopsy - uses a needle with a larger diameter. Done under local anesthesia. Perhaps may be the most common type of breast biopsy?? d) Surgical excision - the 'gold standard' of biopsy - definitely creates internal scarring, making future breast imaging more difficult, but is much less likely to miss the lump or area of concern. Increased risk of infection, and is more expensive than the other biopsy types because its a minor surgical procedure. Maybe be means that if the biopsy you will have next week is normal, then he'll do a little wider excision? (Note: when I had my surgical excision after a core biopsy, my surgical excision removed about 2 tablespoonfuls of tissue. Initially, there was a small dent, but it all filled in, and since about year 2, it healed to a faint pink scar, and I have to really look to see where it was. So 'wider excision', depending of course on your circumstances, does not necessarily mean they will remove a large portion of your breast.) The pathology report is the diagnostic report, so they can't really tell you how they will follow you until you have a diagnosis. Different breast cancer and 'pre-cancers' have different prognoses. Hang in there. We all want to be ready for whatever is ahead. We all hope that you do not have cancer. But no matter what happens, there are people here who can share their experiences and help you on your way.",

They not only look at the number of dots, they look at the size, distribution, and clustering of the dots. They consider things like shadowing in mammograms.  Calcifications typically show up very well in mammograms. Here is an excellent website about calcifications. www.radiologyassistant.nl/en/4...  It includes pictures, so you have some idea what calcifications look like. A BIRADS 5 rating is typical of cancer (about 95%).  However, I have seen several women here with a mammogram BIRADS score of 5 who had benign results. A BIRADS 4 rating is not typical of cancer, but could be cancer. (about 3-95% malignancy).  Yes, that is a big range. Thinking of you as you await your biopsy!  Let us know how it goes, OK?",

      "Content": "Dec 1, 2007 08:28AM - edited Dec 1, 2007 08:46AM by leaf I am so sorry you are going through this. I have LCIS (which is a more advanced form of atypical cells), and ALH (atypical lobular hyperplasia.) I am assuming you have atypical ductal hyperplasia or atypical lobular hyperplasia. Those are by far the two main types (I don't know if there are any others.) Hyperplasia means that you have more than the ordinary number of cells lining the ducts (or lobules). Most people think this, by itself, does not put you at any higher risk of breast cancer. It is thought the next step in the march towards breast cancer, is getting atypical. This means that features of the cell are not normal: such as the cell shape and nuclei are irregular. If you have atypia, this puts you at SLIGHTLY increased risk of breast cancer. This may be slightly controversial, but you may want the area to be excised, to make sure there isn't something worse going on in that area. It is thought the next step along this line is when the cells in the ducts (or lobules) fill up with these atypical cells, in which case it is called Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or if in the lobules Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS.) DCIS is considered cancer. LCIS is usually not considered cancer (in spite of the name. No, I am not crazy (smile.)) LCIS is much more uncommon than DCIS. Going one step further, If the cancer cells break through the duct or lobule to the surrounding tissue on the slide, then you have invasive cancer. To get back to atypia, your case. 1) Make sure you get a copy of your pathology report. They should describe the cells. 2) If you have ADH (atypical ductal hyperplasia), then you MAY want to consider getting your slides reread at a major institution. This is because it is possible to confuse ADH and DCIS. They are treated differently. This can cost on the order of $200-550. Atypia, and nothing worse, puts you at slightly higher risk of breast cancer. If you want to find out HOW MUCH your atypia puts you for breast cancer, well, that is another story. It is CERTAINLY not 100%. If you have a bad family history or personal history of breast cancer, then these ideas below MAY NOT apply. If you have a bad family history of breast cancer, then I would strongly suggest you talk to a board certified genetics counselor to give you the facts to decide whether or not you want to be tested for BRCA. BRCA positive women do have a significant lifetime risk of breast and ovarian cancer. If you have a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, then you may have a known or unknown genetically inherited risk factor. A genetics counselor is the person to get the best answers in this case. Only about 10% of breast cancers are due to genetically inherited causes. There are models that you can use that estimate one's risk of breast cancer. This includes some questions about family history. www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ This is the modified Gail model. There are other models that can be used if you have a strong family history of breast/ovarian cancer. **However**, the number that you get from this modified Gail model has a lot of uncertainty to it for YOU as an individual person. It should not be used for treatment decisions!!! In one study, the Gail model was excellent for predicting how many women in a population would get breast cancer, but it was really terrible at predicting WHICH individual woman would get breast cancer. The accuracy of this model was \"only slightly better than the roll of the dice' in predicting WHICH individual woman will get breast cancer. See my post in the High Risk Section titled Predicting Breast Cancer, dated Sept 17, 2007. I have gotten estimates for my lifetime breast cancer risk that vary from 10% (i.e. no increased risk) to 85% (in a model that has NOT been compared to populations.) (I am at low risk for a BRCA mutation.) If you want numbers in a study, well one of the most recent studies was this one at Sloan Kettering. It looked at women with atypia and women with LCIS. 1: Ann Surg Oncol. 2007 Mar;14(3):1051-7. Epub 2007 Jan 7. Links Results of MRI screening for breast cancer in high-risk patients with LCIS and atypical hyperplasia. Port ER, Park A, Borgen PI, Morris E, Montgomery LL. Breast Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. porte@mskcc.org BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect breast cancer in high-risk patients, but is associated with a significant false-positive rate resulting in unnecessary breast biopsies. More data are needed to define the role of MRI screening for specific high-risk groups. We describe our experience with MRI screening in patients with atypical hyperplasia (AH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data from our high-risk screening program prospective database for the period from April 1999 (when screening MRI was first performed at our institution) to July 2005. Patients with AH or LCIS demonstrated on previous surgical biopsy were identified. All patients underwent yearly mammography and twice yearly clinical breast examination. Additional screening MRI was performed at the discretion of the physician and patient. RESULTS: We identified 378 patients; 126 had AH and 252 had LCIS. Of these, 182 (48%) underwent one or more screening MRIs (mean, 2.6 MRIs; range, 1-8) during this period, whereas 196 (52%) did not. Those who had MRIs were younger (P < 0.001) with stronger family histories of breast cancer (P = 0.02). In MRI-screened patients, 55 biopsies were recommended in 46/182 (25%) patients, with 46/55 (84%) biopsies based on MRI findings alone. Cancer was detected in 6/46 (13%) MRI-generated biopsies. None of the six cancers detected on MRI were seen on recent mammogram. All six cancers were detected in five patients (one with bilateral breast cancer) with LCIS; none were detected by MRI in the AH group. Thus, cancer was detected in 5/135 (4%) of patients with LCIS undergoing MRI. The yield of MRI screening overall was cancer detection in 6/46 (13%) biopsies, 5/182 (3%) MRI-screened patients and 5/478 (1%) total MRIs done. In two additional MRI-screened patients, cancer was detected by a palpable mass in one, and on prophylactic surgery in the other and missed by all recent imaging studies. For 196 non-MRI-screened patients, 21 (11%) underwent 22 biopsies during the same period. Eight of 22 (36%) biopsies yielded cancer in seven patients. All MRI-detected cancers were stage 0-I, whereas all non-MRI cancers were stage I-II. CONCLUSION: Patients with AH and LCIS selected to undergo MRI screening were younger with stronger family histories of breast cancer. MRI screening generated more biopsies for a large proportion of patients, and facilitated detection of cancer in only a small highly selected group of patients with LCIS. PMID: 17206485 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] In it, you can see that there were 126 women with atypical hyperplasia. Over the period of 6 years, 3 of these 126 atypia women got breast cancer. Just taking the raw data, and plugging into a computer, this is about 0.4% per year. All 3 of these women with atypia who got breast cancer during the 6 year study were over the age of 56. (During the same time period 11 women with LCIS and nothing worse out of 252 women got breast cancer.) Age is a significant risk factor for breast cancer. (In this study they include DCIS as a breast cancer.) The average age of diagnosis for these things is about in the 40s or 50s. There probably isn't a lot of data for younger women (in their 20s or 30s), but probably the usual screening that they do for atypia without a bad family history is yearly mammos, plus clinical breast exam every 6-12 months. (As you probably know, the recommended screening for women over 50 is a yearly mammo and clinical breast exam.) It is possible you may be offered an antihormonal (like tamoxifen) but it may be somewhat controversial if the risk is worth the benefit. So, no you are not doomed. The VAST MAJORITY of women with atypia will NEVER get breast cancer. Hope this helps.",

The first thing I would ask for is a copy of your pathology report, so you know with what you are dealing. While people can throw all sorts of figures around, and predict well how many in a POPULATION will get breast cancer, they have a lot harder time in figuring out WHICH individuals in that population will get breast cancer. That is because most of the risk factors for breast cancer have a low risk factor. I am taking these numbers out of the air, but I am guessing that this is different from, say, close exposure but survival to an atom bomb. Most of those people will get cancer/radiation poisoning because this single factor is such a high risk. But most of the risk factors for breast cancer are much lower than that. So its hard to separate out the people with risk for breast cancer from the general population. (BRCA may be an exception.) So I think that breast cancer statistics are hard, but the figures for Atypical Hyperplasia put you at only slightly higher risk. I have LCIS, which is undoubtedly a higher risk than Atypical Hyperplasia (which I have also). Oh, and I was wrong. Another category of atypia is apparently flat epithelial atypia, although they describe ALH with this term also, so as usual I am confused. www.pathologyoutlines.com/brea... A caution about relative risk: do not be unduly concerned when you see figures like: this pathology puts you at 4 or 5 times the usual risk of breast cancer. These are Relative Risk factors. This does NOT NOT NOT mean that you take 10 or 12.5% of cancer times 4 or 5 giving you 60% chance of breast cancer. What you do is this for relative risk: you take the risk of a woman with NO clear risk factors (no previous cancers, no family history, menarche before 11, menopause before 52, first pregnancy before 30), and this is about 1 in 30 or 3.3%, which is MUCH lower than the 'average' risk of 12%. You multiply this 3.3% by the 4 or 5 and get maybe 13-17%, which is not much different than the 'average' risk. (These are approximate figures, and do vary from year to year.) I just don't want to get too upset when you see relative risk factors of 4 or 5 or something. But again these are POPULATION figures, not figures that are applicable to an individual person.",

I will share with you my experience at getting slides reread. I waited over a year to have my slides reread. That's because my slides were read as ALH and LCIS, and there isn't much difference between the treatment of the two. If I had ADH, I would have been more eager to get them reread. I went to the pathology department about a year after I had my excision, and asked them if I could get my slides resent to a major university. They said they throw them away after 6 months! I was very upset!! (Of course I did not tell them my diagnosis.) So I asked my doc (he's the head of oncology at my local hospital.) He said they always keep those wax cubes that generated your cancer diagnosis. They may misplace them, but they are intended to be kept. (LCIS is technically not a cancer, so I don't know what they do, and I don't know if they handle atypia differently.) I am GUESSING in the US the LCIS samples may get to be part of the SEER database. It ended up they DID have my excision slides that showed LCIS and features of ALH. I know on my excision they did at least 16 pieces. So I was concerned after I had my slides reread to find out the pathologist (who selects the slides to be sent) only sent 2 slides from this biopsy to be reread. (At my local major university it ran $550/biopsy.) I later found out from a person who got a PhD in pathology several decades ago (but has NOT used that info in the last several decades) that they usually squish as much tissue into the little blocks as they can. So one slide can contain tissue from SEVERAL different pieces of tissue. So I don't know whether or not they will give you the wax cubes to keep yourself. I don't know whether you have to protect them from melting (if that is a concern.) I don't know if they will let you keep slides (which of course would be much more fragile.) I don't know if the samples or slides will degrade. I keep my own mammos so they won't get misplaced and because they are from more than one facility. In my humble experience, different specialties handle this info differently. I had some non-breast surgery done, and I had to sign a consent that I would submit all disputes into arbitration before the doc would see me at all, but I HAVE in my possession all of the imaging from that specialty-they gave them to me immediately after they took them, before the images were even read. However, my breast surgeon's attitude seems much more secretive. When I was transporting my mammos from one facility to another, they sealed them up so they would be able to tell if I looked at them. (I didn't have to sign a dispute thing though.) So the last time I had mammos, I just kept them. I bring them with me whenever I have another mammo. Some women here have had their mammos conveniently 'misplaced', whether or not that was intentional. I don't know if that is because they expect women to not want to know about their bodies or what. Obviously your experience may differ. But I think it would be a good idea to ASK. And ask if they will keep the wax cubes and slides, or if they will be thrown away or what. If they are going to throw them away, I'd much rather have them in my possession!",

I have anxiety issues too. I don't care if you are frightened by pink and purple polkadots- you are anxious for a reason, and whether or not you find out why or if your panic goes away is irrelevant. Your feelings need to be treated with respect. I have gotten a new diagnosis every 3-6 months since I was diagnosed with LCIS in Jan 2006. I got concerned about whether they were 'all in my head' too. You should be treated with respect. Even if your doctor doesn't treat you with respect, please know that I think you should be. Most women here feel 'the best lump is the lump in the jar'-meaning that lumps should get biopsied to get to the bottom of this. This means lumps in the most well adjusted women, and in those that are as crazy as a fruitcake, and everyone inbetween. What person doesn't have some neuroses? By the way, I heard of a person who had strep throat for 5 years, and ended up having some inborn immunologic condition. There are some infectious diseases that can produce prolonged fevers. I, too, get into stress eating when the going is tough. Its hard to find things that are 'soothing' to yourself when you are going through this. I'm sorry you have to deal with a doctor you don't like. It makes it even harder to go through this testing process. Please feel free to vent or ask questions. We're here for you.",

      "Content": "Oct 6, 2017 01:15PM - edited Oct 6, 2017 01:22PM by leaf When they found classic LCIS on my core biopsy (2005), the first words my breast surgeon said to me was 'If you want prophylactic bilateral mastectomies, I'll fall down in a chair.\" This was before she even said Hello, or asked me about my family history. I don't know if I would have had BPMs if I was given the opportunity, but obviously if your surgeon won't do it, its not going to happen. When I had a 2nd opinion at an NCI-certified breast center (in the USA), they said they did NOT recommend BPMs for me at that point. (If you don't know what type of LCIS you have, try to get a copy of your pathology report.) Almost everything concerning LCIS is controversial. Be prepared to get a variety of recommendations. Even if your breast surgeon recommends BPM, do check with your insurance to make sure it is covered. (I don't know how the medical system works in Australia.) Assuming you have the (most common) classic type of LCIS, and no significant family history or single gene mutation, and have not had chest Xray TREATMENT (such as for lymphoma), probably less than half of women with LCIS (and nothing worse like DCIS or invasive breast cancer) will ever get anything worse. If you have an uncommon type of LCIS, then they are normally considered more serious. For a nice report of different types of LCIS, see from 2012 http://www.ucsfcme.com/2012/slides/MAP1201A/18YiCh...). The uncommon types of LCIS were just 'discovered' or 'established' in the last 20-30 years, and indeed are uncommon, so we have less information about them. Unless you have strict concordance between your imaging and the core biopsy, they will probably recommend at least a breast excision. The excision is NOT to remove the LCIS (because LCIS is almost always multifocal and often bilateral, and they can't reliably tell where you have LCIS unless they look at a tissue sample under the microscope). The excision (which removes the area around the core biopsy) is to help ensure there is not something worse (such as DCIS or invasive breast cancer) in the vicinity, which happens ROUGHLY 20% of the time. (Different studies differ.) When classic LCIS women go on in the future to have breast cancer, the breast cancer is often in an area that looks TOTALLY NORMAL on imaging. For more info and experiences, see the LCIS forum, below. Once you have had an excision, there is NO RUSH to make a choice about your treatment, and you can change your treatment choice in the future (except of course for BPMs.) No matter how many women you see that chose one route vs another, that is no guarantee it will be right for YOU. Only you know how you would feel about BPMs or the anxiety of continued surveillance, or side effects of anti-hormonal prevention. There is no BEST option for all women. As Mamabear said, good for you for doing your research; take as much time as you need. Weigh the risks and benefits of each option. Then make the best decision for YOU, which may or may not be like anyone else's decision.",

They can last some time, but they eventually do go away.  It takes some time for the body to re-absorb the hemoglobin in blood, and hemoglobin is structurally related to chlorophyll in leaves.   Evenually, my breast turned to its normal color and softness.  It just took some time.  Maybe gentle massage would have helped to break up the harder areas.  But, for me, my only memento is a pinkish scar.",

Since its growing and shrinking, then it sounds like its hormone sensitive (hormones from her monthly cycle.)   I don't know if the ultrasound being 'clean' means it was a cyst or not.  Cysts are almost always benign.  If it was a cyst, then they may have wanted her to go to a surgeon to get it drained.  Draining cysts (if big enough) is a very simple, in office proceedure. Draining cysts both relieves pain (if any) and makes the diagnosis at the same time. It also makes it easier to tell if there might be something behind the cyst, say in the future.   If the lump is NOT a cyst, she may want to get this evaluated further.  If she is breast feeding, this may be more complicated. The amount of radiation in a mammogram is MUCH less than it was decades ago.  But, as with anything with radiation, it is good to avoid radiation if its unnecessary. But if imaging is needed, it should be done.  If she was, say, 12 years old, then she may be VERY sensitive to radiation to her breasts at this age (12), and this may be associated with breast cancer sometime during her adult life.  (The mean age to get breast cancer is in one's early 60s.) There is a very common kind of benign lump, called fibroadenoma, that often happens in younger women.  They can grow fairly rapidly.  They often degenerate and shrink over time.  They are often hormone responsive. If the ultrasound did clearly show this was a simple cyst, then it is her decision whether or not to get this followed up and/or drained.   No imaging technique used with breast cancer is 100% accurate. This is true for most things in life too.  They can't diagnose someone with usual breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. Of course, we cannot diagnose you, or make the choice of what your wife should do.  ",

Note when they say that ADH has '3-4 times the risk of breast cancer', this is NOT 3-4 times the ~13% lifetime risk of the average woman in the USA, but 3-4 times the risk of a woman WITHOUT any particular risk factors, which is somewhere in the area of 3-5%.  So ADH confers a risk of about 3-5 X 3-4 = 9-20% lifetime risk of breast cancer. These risk models also assume that risk factors are additive.  That is an assumption: sometimes they are not. For example, they know the risk factor alcohol is NOT additive with some other risk factors. Even if they knew the risk of a person with ADH and nothing worse, that does NOT mean they know *your* risk.  Even the Gail model, which HAS been compared to populations,  for *individuals* is 'better than the toss of a coin, but not by much.' http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.full.pdf As has been said, \"There are 3 kinds of lies: lies, damn lies, and statistics.\" Be careful with statistics.",

That is so very important. No one on this wide green earth can tell you for sure whether or not you have breast cancer at this point, and I don't think they can tell if your axillary lump is related to your 'vague asymmetric density' and dimple are related. (I assume the dimple is new, not pre-existing.) Dr. Love (a breast surgeon) in her book opines that a breast surgeon can only feel your breasts from the outside; you can feel them from both the inside and the outside. She opines that if you really think there is something wrong with your breast, then insist on a biopsy, no matter what the doctor says. If you are wrong, you will have peace of mind. If you are right, you may have saved your life. For me, its important that I and my doctor can 'relate' to each other. (I have anxiety issues too.) Its quite important to me that I can relate especially to my PCP, because they are the ones that make referrals. Just to warn you- it can be hard to find a surgeon who 'relates' to you. You can't expect that a person who takes you apart and puts you together again can also be warm and fuzzy. The decision is ultimately yours. This is a hard thing to decide. I know if my personality was fitted with your body, I know what I would do, but we are all different.",

Here's more from webmd.   http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/prolactin-15129 It says you should not stimulate the nipple, exercise, or eat before the test.  It doesn't say how long to fast beforehand.   Since its probably too late to call your lab, I get the impression that probably 8-12 hour fast is sufficient. I get the idea there is controversy on whether prolactin causes breast cancer.  This 2008 journal article opines that prolactin does not cause breast cancer www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... , as does this 2009 paper. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19632054 Most experts I've read opine that about 5-15% of breast cancer cases are due to single deleterious genes, and about 70% of women  who get breast cancer have no obvious risk factors for breast cancer (besides being a woman.)",

(You can use a ruler or tape measure and write down its size horizontally and vertically.)  Untreated cancer does NOT shrink. The vast majority of premenopausal breast lumps are benign. If you are postmenopausal, then I would make an appointment with your GP.  You may want to make an appointment with your GP now, regardless of how your lump behaves, and if your lump shrinks you can cancel it.  It usually takes me at least a week or 2 to get an appointment with my GP. If in doubt, get it checked out with your doctor.  Typically, postmenopausal breast cancer is associated with sporatic cases of breast cancer.   That doesn't mean its impossible that you have a familial mutation, but its less likely. The mean age to get breast cancer in the USA is in one's early 60s.   About 70% of women who get breast cancer have no obvious risk factors (besides being a woman.)  Let us know how it goes, OK?",

MRIs are notorious for picking up lots of 'junk' as well as seeing cancers that are not seen on other imaging.  They aren't usually used for routine screening, except in special cases (like BRCA women), because they would generate LOTS of needless biopsies and they are too expensive.  But they are the least invasive route especially if you have dense breasts. MRIs can pick up things like inflammation, etc, that are benign but show up on MRI.  In scientific language, this is called a 'high false positive rate.'   No imaging technique is 100% correct. But, yes, MRI can pick up a lot of stuff that is not seen in mammograms or ultrasounds.",

I am so glad you are seeing a surgeon.  Is this a breast surgeon?  That would be even better. Breast cancer is unusual in young women, but it certainly happens.  I totally agree with Bobbie.  Keep searching until you find a cause.  Maybe you have an infection or something, but you need to know that.   They can't diagnose you with breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. ",

      "Content": "Oct 29, 2010 09:03AM - edited Aug 20, 2013 06:03AM by leaf Well, the subject of LCIS, LN, and ALH are full of controversy. LCIS was first described in the 1940s by prominent pathologists, and from the slides (i.e. dead cells) they thought that LCIS looked very much like DCIS (which had been first described in the ?1890s?).  They thought LCIS had the same kind of risk as DCIS.  But they didn't know the natural history of LCIS. (Natural history means following the course of women with LCIS to see how many of them went on to get breast cancer.)  Since LCIS(and nothing worse) is an unusual condition (one paper proposed the incidence in the normal population might be about 1:10,000 - this is a Rough Approximation),there is not a whole lot of information.  But, on the other hand, we don't know how many women are walking around with ALH or LCIS and don't know it because they haven't had a breast biopsy, let alone a breast biopsy at the appropriate spot in the breast. Since the pathologists were so prominent, the name LCIS 'stuck' (for the most part).  There is NOT complete agreement about the LCIS name.  Most oncologists (not all oncologists) think that the name LCIS is a misnomer, and it is something that is usually a marker for increased risk for future breast cancer.  LN is a description about a continuum of cells in the lobules-it includes both ALH and LCIS. A rough analogy is that the breast ducts and lobules in the breast are like a bunch of dead end streets that intertwine but don't intersect (at least in the ductal part).  The dead ends are the lobules.  The streets are all lined with a sidewalk (the basement membrane).  You have cars parked along the sidewalks (which are like the cells that normally line the ducts and lobules.)  If you have hyperplasia, this means there are more cars parked along the sidewalk - like cars parked in the streets but block the driveways to the houses.  Hyperplasia doesn't put you at additional risk for breast cancer (or if it does, its hardly measurable.)  If the cars are beat up, then you have atypical hyperplasia.  Its the atypia that puts one at increased risk.  So you have more than the normal cells lining the lobules, and they look beat up, making ALH. If you have abnormal cells that cross the sidewalk (basement membrane) and to the garages and houses, then you have invasive breast cancer. DCIS, LCIS, LN, ALH, and ADH, by definition, have *not* crossed the basement membrane, and are restricted to the lobules and/or ducts.  It is usually easy to see if a breast lesion is invasive or non-invasive, but it can be more difficult to classify non-invasive conditions.  So, some people do choose to get a 2nd reading of their slides at a major institution, especially if they are diagnosed with DCIS and/or ADH because they are normally treated differently. LCIS means you have not only cells that line the dead ends, you also have cars filling up the entire dead end (like 'marbles in a bag' and expand the lobules, to mix metaphors.)  This is a rough description, and the analogy is not perfect, of course. Unfortunately, different pathologists sometimes define ALH and LCIS (and ADH and DCIS) differently.  Here are the criteria for ALH as defined by a pathologist at Stanford. surgpathcriteria.stanford.edu/... The 'usual' ways of handling LCIS are 1)'watchful waiting' - minimum yearly mammograms and twice-a-year clinical exams (since you are young, they may be more hesitant of doing mammograms, because in general, younger women tend to have denser breasts (making mammograms harder to read), and younger breasts may be more sensitive to radiation).)  But there is controversy about all aspects. 2) Watchful waiting (see #1) plus anti-hormonals.  Before menopause, your current choice if you do desire antihormonals is tamoxifen. 3) Bilateral prophylactic mastectomies, usually for women with higher family history/risk. www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pd... I have a weak family history, LCIS, ALH, and radial scar, and my breast surgeon said she was not interested in doing any more surgery on me (after my excision).  Thus, we couldn't discuss BPMs. I didn't/don't appreciate this, even though I may have chosen to not have PBMs anyway.  (I have other issues too; don't we all.)  Since I've been on this board (since late 2005), most women with LCIS had more intensive screening than I have.  At a 2nd opinion I had in 2007 at an NCI-certified major institution, they said for LCIS women at that institution, they offer yearly mammograms, and twice-a-year clinical exams, and offer tamoxifen. Here's what the ACS says about ALH (and ADH). http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/FindCancerEarly/WomensHealth/Non-CancerousBreastConditions/non-cancerous-breast-conditions-hyperplasia The subject of breast cancer risk prediction is in its infancy.   The models that we have currently are VERY poor at predicting the breast cancer risk of any one particular individual.  At least in the Gail model (the major breast cancer risk model) say it should NOT be used to guide treatment decisions for any particular woman.  (One paper says the Gail model, or another model that includes other breast cancer risk factors such as breast density as 'better than the toss of a coin, but not by much.')  jnci.oxfordjournals.org/conten...    If you do have a deleterious BRCA mutation, then some breast cancer risk models may be better than this.  (That's one of the many issues that would be discussed with you by a genetic counselor.) This is the 2007 paper from ACS that described their recommendations for MRI *screening*, not MRI diagnosis.caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/c... So, except for the facts about the first descriptions about LCIS, everything  about LCIS is controversial. As far as BRCA 'treatment', they include watchful waiting, with or without antihormonals, prophylactic mastectomies, prophylactic oophorectomies (removal of the ovaries).  I'm not an expert on BRCA, so I may not be up to date if there are more options.  Genetic counselors are the 'experts' at keeping up with BRCA.  Different BRCA mutations may put one at different breast cancer and ovarian cancer risks.  Genetic mutation information changes all the time; it is an evolving area of knowledge.   Let us know how it goes, OK?",

(I'm just guessing, of course, but its not practical to do so.) I go to a community cancer center (not a renown first class facility).  My oncologist says they should be keeping the sample that showed your diagnosis indefinitely.  They may misplace it, but the intention should be to keep it.  At my facility, they usually throw away NORMAL samples after, say, 6 months or a year,due to space concerns.  I would guess this would be true for most places, but of course I don't know. Here's a website about handling mastectomy specimens.  (Its just a draft, but just to give you an idea.) www.netautopsy.org/axsop/axsop... WARNING: It is rather graphic. When I had my slides reread at an NCI center, the pathologist selected the slides to be sent.  From what I understand, to make the slide, they normally stuff as much tissue as they can into the little cube, stabilize it (?with parafin or plastic?) and slice it into sections thin enough to see under the microscope.  The NCI lab charged a flat fee for each BIOPSY that was reread.  I had no control over how many slides were read.  It ended up that usually only 1 slide per biopsy was sent and read. (For me, in 2007, the out of pocket  charge was almost $500/biopsy.)  Sometimes insurance will pay for some re-reads.",

No one on this big green earth, not the brightest Nobel Prize winner in Breast cancer, can tell you for sure if you have something to worry about or not. I have LCIS and nothing worse (this is uncommon), had an excision, and on tamoxifen.  Believe me, I know my choices.  I have looked at all 200+ Pubmed abstracts about LCIS and nothing worse. When I went to my last procedure, unrelated to my LCIS. I work at this hospital.  The nurse who took care of me had invasive bc.  When she saw I had LCIS, she asked if I had radiation or a SNB, and when I said no, she looked at me distainly, then finally said, well its only in-situ, judgementally. My treatment (excision + tamoxifen) is completely standard for LCIS.  They don't normally do radiation for LCIS.   If you have bilateral mastectomies, SNBs are not routinely done - they're usually only done if the patient begs for it. Maybe this nurse knew a lot about invasive breast cancer, but she  did NOT know about LCIS and nothing worse.  Some people don't have the humility and ego strength to admit what they don't know, or maybe they feel out of control for you, or maybe want to prepare you in case you don't know.   I essentially had a male employee at my hospital (he was friends with a co-worker) recommend bilateral mastectomies for me 'since a co-worker of his had that and that's what she had.'  He was completely out of date.  Even if that was routine practice, he had no right to make this judgement.   How would you feel if at work, essentially a stranger comes up to you and tells you that you need your sexual organs removed?

Well, first they should be doing a clinical exam of your breast and surrounding areas, such as above your clavicle, your armpits, etc. It sounds like you haven't had a mammogram before?  They tend to be more cautious with mammograms in younger women (in this case below about 40 is a younger woman), because many younger women have 'dense breasts'.  This means that its hard to see through the mammograms - it looks like a 'snowstorm', and they can't see anything through the whiteout.  Also, there may be some concern about radiation to younger breasts.  This would be more of a concern if you are, say 22, rather than if you are, say 39. If they do mammograms, then you do feel pressure, but it is for less than, say, 30 seconds.  Whether or not they do a mammogram, they will probably order an ultrasound of your breast.  I found ultrasounds to be quite relaxing at my place.  At my place they used warmed up ultrasound gel, and roll the instrument over your breast.  If they do order these, they are not ordering them because they are convinced you have breast cancer!  They can use these mammograms and ultrasounds to help diagnose even BENIGN conditions. Remember, the most common symptom of breast cancer is a painLESS lump.  The mean age to get breast cancer is 61, which means that half of the people with breast cancer are younger than 61 and half are over 61. Most lumps in younger women are either a benign thing with a big long name called a fibroadenoma, or else cysts, which are a fluid filled sac, which are almost always benign. But for your own peace of mind, keep pursuing this until you are convinced about the answer. They may even be able to do some of the tests there on the spot.  But I had to make an appointment 2-3 weeks hence for each step of the diagnosis. For many women, it can take several months to get fully diagnosed, but some women are diagnosed in a few days.

Pain is not a very accurate way of diagnosing breast cancer overall. But I would encourage you to get it checked out. I also have had a terrible time going through biopsies. I had a very traumatic wire insertion before my excision (pain-wise). This made me so upset that when I had my next stereotactic biopsy, I completely pulled out of the machine when they were trying to insert the anesthetic. They had to physically hold me in the machine the whole time. So you are not alone in having emotional issues. If you are considering having a biopsy, would it be appropriate to consider requesting a medication for anxiety for the procedure? I have eczema of the hands (not of the breasts) but know how the skin splits can cause real pain (I don't know if this is similar to what you are having.) Paget's disease is NOT the same as inflammatory breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer is very unusual and often difficult to diagnose. The only real way they can diagnose it is by looking at tissue under the microscope, like every other breast cancer.",

Just because she goes to a breast surgeon does NOT mean she will have surgery.   At my place, if a breast surgeon (or radiologist or OBGYN) orders a core biopsy, the radiologist does it.  If a surgical excision is required, then the breast surgeon does it.  If a fine needle biopsy is needed, then I think the breast surgeon does it. Different places do things differently.  At my 2nd opinion place, breast surgeons order antihormonals; at my 1st opinion place, my oncologist does. My breast surgeon refuses to do  more surgery on me. (One of my options should be to have bilateral mastectomies.) Breast surgeons should NOT be enthused to do surgery.  Now, to get a diagnosis of breast cancer, the pathologist has to look at a piece of tissue inder the microscope. That requires some sort of tissue movement on some level. It will be YOUR WIFE's choice if she wants to go along with the breast surgeon's proposed path.  Your wife can say 'NO' at any time.",

We all want to be ready for whatever is ahead for us. We don't want to be caught unprepared.  When I was getting diagnosed, I asked myself if I had advanced breast cancer, would I live to see the tumor board (a gathering of physicians that get together to discuss difficult cases).  I didn't go this far, but some people here have planned their funeral in detail (down to the flowers, songs, etc.)  Many people have said 'don't borrow trouble', the chances are high that this will not be breast cancer.  But I found its almost impossible for me to not go there.   You've probably seen the figure that overall about 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign.  That's a big number. What I didn't know is that  even if you go to the 'worst case scenario', breast cancer is not an automatic death sentence.The number of people who are initially diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer is small.  Here's a decision pathway that was printed in about 2001.  www.imaginis.com/breast-cancer...        There are about 155,000 women in the USA who are living with metastatic breast cancer. About 10% of the people who have metastatic cancer were diagnosed with metastatic cancer from the initial diagnosis.  http://mbcn.org/developing-awareness/category/13-things-everyone-should-know-about-metastatic-breast-cancer/ Its very easy to go to the 'well, what if I'm one of the 0.00000x% of people who die of breast cancer?  I've had strange things happen to me before.'  Well, if you go that route, I'm not saying its easy, but the worry is awful to deal with, and if you get benign results then you will have gone through that worry for nothing.  If you do get a diagnosis of breast cancer, then you will have to go through that worry twice.  The worry won't make any difference in our chances of getting a worse diagnosis. Humans are notoriously bad about estimating the risk of a bad outcome.  Its much easier to worry about things that are beyond our control rather than things that are in our control. For example, on average, people are much more afraid of dying in a plane crash than dying in a car crash, even though its much more likely we will die in a car crash. I found distraction helped.  Of course, its better if the distraction is not self destructive.  Take a big breath.  For some people, this does not work, and they do other things like get anti-anxiety meds, practice meditation or religion or whatever works for them. Its not easy to get through, but you will eventually know your diagnosis.  Hang in there.  You are not alone.",

On one hand, no one on this big green earth, not even the Nobel laureate of breast cancer diagnosis (if there was one) could tell you 100% if a particular person has breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  The only possible exception is with the unusual inflammatory breast cancer, where sometimes the diagnosis is made by clinical symptoms. But, radiologists can make good guesses. They aren't 100%, but they are much better than 50%-50%. The incidence rate of someone indicating 'its probably nothing' or 'its nothing' when it really is something is called the 'false negative' rate. Unfortunately, there is almost nothing in the field of breast cancer that is '100%'.  Overall, mammograms are thought to catch roughly 80% of breast cancers. In mammograms, and other imaging, they often rank findings according to the BIRADS score. www.cancer.org/treatment/under...  .  As you can see, a category 3 BIRADS score has about a 2% chance of being malignant, and a BIRADS 5 score has about <5% chance of being benign.  ",

Most women are petrified about having breast cancer. I know I was crying at home and at work when I was going through the screening process. I have only had 1 callback, and a collegue who has never been diagnosed with any breast cancer has had at least 10 callbacks. So callbacks are common. But do check out your symptom of breast thickening. Show it to the technician and/or radiologist. It is very good that you are getting this checked out and not running away and hiding (some women do that.) They do that because they are so very, very frightened. That said, please know that most women that get call backs for mammograms are fine. You have a thickening which it is important to get checked out. Most women with breast symptoms of one kind or another turn out NOT to have breast cancer. If they are suspicious, they will recommend a biopsy. If you feel at all uncomfortable with what they are saying, then I would insist on a biopsy. A biopsy is the gold-standard way to find out what is going on. If you have a negative mammo and/or negative ultrasound, then make sure this gets investigated until you are comfortable with what they say. It is your body. Biopsies are invasive and can be costly, but if you really think that something is wrong then insist on one.

I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but - if you just consider the breast cancer issue, its actually good that your symptoms are changing.  There is a rare kind of breast cancer that can be mistaken for mastitis.  For this rare cancer, usually after a course of antibiotics things don't get better OR get worse.  Usually for this breast cancer, the symptoms stay the same - they don't get better or worse. Of course you want to get this checked out.  For ordinary, run-of-the-mill breast cancer, they now think it has been in the breast for some 6-10 years before it can be detected by ANY means.  So a delay of a few weeks/months doesn't make any difference clinically.  It SURE makes a difference emotionally though. Sometimes things get delayed for reasons we don't know - maybe the secretary or radiologist is on vacation or had a family emergency come up, maybe it got lost in the shuffle.  Some women here have had their films sent to another facility to get a 2nd opinion.  It sure would be nice if they told you!!",

They will tell you when you need to hold your breath.  For me, on my 2nd biopsy, I asked them to be very clear when they wanted me to breathe vs not breathe, because I wasn't sure I was always following directions on my first stereotactic.  Mine ordered 'Breathe'  then 'Don't breathe' then 'breathe'.  Sometimes the machine jerked and popped so I wasn't sure I was hearing the 'don't' in 'don't breathe'.  The order to 'don't breathe' only lasts something like 5 or 10 seconds.   The table I was on was lifted, so I was about ?4 feet above the floor.  My first stereotactic was just fine.  I was told when I had pain, just tell him, and they would stop and give more anesthetic.  I did, he did, and it was certainly bearable. I had a harder time on my 2nd stereotactic.  This wasn't the radiologist's fault.  Its because I had a traumatic time with a wire insertion, which triggered my PTSD-like syndrome.  So on my 2nd stereotactic, when my breast was in the mammo machine, and they were going to inject the first dose of anesthetic (I'm sure with the smallest gauge needle available), I instinctively pulled out of the mammo machine (which hurt  quite a bit of course). I'm sure I was so sensitized to any potential pain in my breast that it wouldn't have mattered what he did or how skillfully he did it - I was just terrified. He asked why I pulled out of the mammo machine, and I said because the needle hurt.  He puzzled over this, and the technician held me in the machine for the rest of the biopsy, rubbing my back, while I silently cried.  It was because of my past experience in my wire insertion (before an surgical excision).  Your body learns from past experience.  If I hadn't had a traumatic wire insertion, I probably would have been fine. There were towels around my chest and head (to pad the metal table).  They don't want you to move  your breasts, of course. Since you know it is possible you may cry, I would ask them what you should do before the procedure starts.  That way, they are more prepared, and you will know what to do. No, your questions are NOT silly AT ALL.   We all act in accordance to our past experience.  A two year old will pull away from a hot stove after (s)he learns the stove is hot.  We naturally pull away from a traumatic situation, or cry when we are scared or hurt.  That is a completely normal reaction.    We all have different pasts and different personalities.  There is no right or wrong in this.  There is just you and your past and how you feel about things. I don't think anyone should judge how you react.  We are all different and have had different experiences.  I had radically different experiences the two different times I had a stereotactic, at the same facility. Some people have done meditation-like things that help them, or picture a very pleasant, peaceful place.  I think some people *may* have brought in their iPods (but I'm not sure about this - check beforehand if you plan on doing this!!)  Subsequently, I did some biofeedback training, which I'm sure would have helped had I known how to do this. My last stereotactic was in 2007, so others may have more recent experience. Of course we wish you a pain-free procedure and your results are Boringly Benign. You don't have to be brave.  It is in your best interests, though, to show up.",

The radiologist sat below me, so he could handle everything.  (When I got up after the procedure, I could look through the 'boob hole' to see his chair beneath me.) At my place, if you take a sedative before the procedure, and they know about it, they will insist that you have a ride home and not drive yourself. If you tend to get very emotional during the procedure, if possible, it may be good to have a backup driver if you can.   People can get very emotional during biopsies.  Before my 'suspicious mammogram' days, I saw a lady *run* through the mammogram waiting room, crying.  That is the same waiting room they used for biopsies.  I now understand that woman's anxiety, though I didn't then.  (Before my 'suspicious mammogram' I thought the only women who get breast cancer were women who ignore their breast lumps.  See what I knew. And I'm a pharmacist.) You are not alone. We are all holding out our hands to you.  Hang in there.",

I have ALH, LCIS (which is more advanced stage of ALH) and nothing worse.  Different studies give different numbers, but in this study, about 10% of women with ALH got upgraded to something worse on surgical excision. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...  In this study, it was 16% www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16...  (Upgrade would include LCIS or DCIS in your case.) I had my surgical excision about 6 weeks after my core biopsy.   I did my genetic counseling about 6 weeks after my surgical excision.  It ends up I have a weak family history, and a low risk for BRCA, so my situation was different from yours.  They should already know the location and mutation they are looking for from your sister. There is no rush for ALH women to decide what to do.  After my genetic counseling, it took another 3 months to get an appointment with an oncologist (I chose tamoxifen.) Here is more information about BRCA positive options. Its quite detailed, along with studies, which may be too much information right now?? www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pd...     I bet all these options would  be THOROUGHLY discussed with you should you test positive for BRCA during genetic counseling.  At the place I went, they required genetic counseling both before and after testing. Different places do things differently.  That's just what happened for me.  You have a different situation. Let us know how it goes, OK?",

I have classic LCIS, ALH, and a weak family history.  I had checks (ultrasound, mammos, clinical exams) every 3 months or so for a year.  I had a pair of biopsies 1 year post-excision, which gave ALH and DH (not atypical ductal hyperplasia).  For the last 3.5 years, I have had twice-a-year clinical exams and yearly mammograms.  The NCCN guidelines are to have a medical history every 6-12 months, and a yearly mammogram unless bilateral mastectomies have been done.nccn.com/patient-guidelines.html So my monitoring slowed down after my breasts quieted down.  (I also started tamoxifen.)   I think its more critical for people with DCIS and ADH to have their slides re-read.  I didn't get a whole lot of satisfaction with my 2nd opinion at a major institution.

(If you haven't already had it excised.) There certainly are some papers that support excision. 1: Radiology. 2004 Jun;231(3):813-9. Epub 2004 Apr 22. Links Comment in: Radiology. 2004 Jun;231(3):617-21. Lobular carcinoma in situ or atypical lobular hyperplasia at core-needle biopsy: is excisional biopsy necessary? Foster MC, Helvie MA, Gregory NE, Rebner M, Nees AV, Paramagul C. Department of Radiology, TC 2910N, University of Michigan Health System, 1500 E Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0326, USA. PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine frequency of invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) at excisional biopsy in women with atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) at percutaneous core-needle biopsy (CNB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review of results in 6,081 consecutive patients who underwent CNB at two institutions revealed that in 35 (0.58%), LCIS (n = 15) or ALH (n = 20) was the pathologic finding with highest risk. Patient age range was 41-84 years (mean, 59 years). Of 35 patients, 26 (74%) underwent excisional biopsy and nine (26%) underwent mammographic follow-up for longer than 2 years. Lesions with a pathologic upgrade were noted when invasive cancer or DCIS occurred at the CNB site. CNB results in patients with a diagnosis of atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) (75 of 6,081 [1.2%]) were reviewed; these patients underwent subsequent excisional biopsy. Statistical comparison of frequency of upgrading of lesions in patients with a diagnosis of LCIS or ALH at CNB and in those with a diagnosis of ADH at CNB was performed (Pearson chi(2) test). RESULTS: In six (17%) of 35 (95% CI: 4.7%, 29.6%) patients, lesions were upgraded to DCIS (n = 4) or invasive cancer (n = 2). In 15 patients with LCIS diagnosed at CNB, lesions in four (27%) were upgraded to either DCIS or invasive cancer. In 20 patients with ALH diagnosed at CNB, lesions were upgraded to DCIS in two (10%). Lesions in nine patients who underwent mammographic follow-up were stable. No mammographic or technical findings distinguished patients with upgraded lesions from those whose lesions were not upgraded. In 12 (16%) of 75 (95% CI: 7.7%, 24.3%) patients with ADH, lesions were upgraded. Difference between the upgrade rate in patients with LCIS or ALH and that in those with ADH was not significant (P =.88). CONCLUSION: Lesions in 17% of patients with LCIS or ALH at CNB were upgraded to invasive cancer or DCIS; this rate was similar to the upgrade rate in patients with ADH. Excisional biopsy is supported when LCIS, ALH, or ADH is diagnosed at CNB. Copyright RSNA, 2004 PMID: 15105449 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] 2) Should I get my slides reread? (Your insurance may or may not cover.) If you haven't been excised, and choose to get excised, then you may want to hold off on this depending on what the excision says. 3) *IF* you have a bad family history (such as a first degree relative who had breast or ovarian cancer, or multiple second degree relatives), should you see a board certified genetics counselor to get genetics counseling? (This is usually at a major institution or university.) (Board certified genetics counselors should NOT pressure you one way or another to get tested. They can evaluate your family tree to try to estimate your risk of having a BRCA mutation. Some people can't get their family tree evaluated because they are adopted or other reasons. It was like pulling hen's teeth to get some of the family data for me. ) The reason why this may be important is that if they think you have a strong possibility of genetically linked breast cancer running around in your family, this may affect your treatment choices or options. All of these questions can be answered yes or no depending on your particular circumstances and preferences. There is no blantantly right or wrong choices for any of these questions. I personally am pretty proactive, and if you haven't been excised, then if I were in your shoes, I would strongly consider excision. But it is a personal choice.",

Many women find breast lumps by accident.  Almost all of the women on this site have had breast cancer, or are at higher risk for breast cancer, or are going through the diagnostic process.  Most women who have breast lumps end up having BENIGN breast lumps, and not breast cancer.  They usually stop posting here.  So the replies you get here will come from a very skewed population. I've never had any breast lumps, but a big percentage of breast lumps are the almost always benign cysts (which are fluid filled sacs) or benign fibroadenomas. In fact, overall (particularly for women under about 50 years of age) about 80% of breast biopsies end up being benign.  That's a big number.   Anxiety and stress are the norm for women undergoing this diagnostic process. Who wouldn't be worried if they might have a major illness?  Its totally understandable. Can stress cause breast cancer?  Well, that's technically a hard question to answer.  Its hard to objectively measure stress.  For one person, losing members of their family may be no big thing, because they weren't close to them or couldn't form close attachments with them, but for other people, walking across a restaurant to use the restroom is a MAJOR anxiety situation.   About 70% of women who do get breast cancer have no obvious risk factors (besides being a woman.)  We don't know what causes most breast cancers.   Yes, there is controversy about this issue.  For example, these reports claim there is an association between stress and breast cancer: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21875303 This paper suggests stress may alter the immune system. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21600570 However, these authors disagree: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21553982 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19572196 But,  whether or not stress can be a factor in causing breast cancer, that information will NOT be helpful to you.  A person cannot change the past, and it is difficult to change one's coping mechanisms.  Even if you propose, \"I got this lump because I ate that artificially flavored candy 10 years ago\", all that would do is to make you feel guilty.  Not helpful.  Makes you feel even worse. Breast cancer is NOT caused by 'negative thinking'.  It is totally natural to be frightened by the prospect of breast cancer.  It is NOT helpful to people with cancer to be told their feelings caused their cancer.  It is not helpful to tell someone they should have different feelings than whatever they are feeling.   Isn't it normal for anyone to be distressed if someone gives them bad news? I believe we should all, like all normal people, be free to have good days and bad days.",

So another poster thought that \"Women at age 28 are commonly diagnosed with breast cancer\"?  I don't know how that other poster was defining the word 'common', but the government/SEER study (a survey of almost all the people in the US with cancer) says: Breast cancer in adolescents and young adults is rare. From 1975 to 2000, less than 0.1% of all breast cancer occurred in young women under 30 years of age.    http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/aya/ The mean age to get breast cancer is in one's 60s.  That means of course that it is POSSIBLE for a young person to get breast cancer, but, according to these statistics, it is not common. If you have a horrible family history (such as sister, mother, father, and/or brother with breast cancer, especially multiple members in your  IMMEDIATE family), or have a history of chest radiation TREATMENT due to things like Hodgkin's lymphoma - this is NOT a diagnostic chest Xray - , then you are definitely at higher risk, and they may want to be more cautious and thorough about ruling out breast cancer in someone with that history.  The definition of cancer is uncontrolled GROWTH.  There are slow growing cancers where the growth rate may be very slow.  But if your breast lump is shrinking,  then, if your lump is composed of 1 type of tissue, I don't understand how this could be breast cancer.  Many, many breast lumps in young women are hormonally driven (they grow and shrink in response to your menstrual cycle.) These lumps that grow and shrink in response to one's menstrual cycle are benign.  I haven't read here of anyone who had a shrinking breast lump that was diagnosed with breast cancer. I guess it could happen if you had a lump that was shrinking faster than a small cancer was growing.  But that's a real, real long shot. I've not heard about that happening. At your age, it is highly unlikely you would have breast cancer, unless you are in one of the high risk groups such as a rotten family history or history of chest radiation TREATMENT (or were involved in high dose radiation like stuck in Chernobyl or a nuclear bomb or something.) Of course I can't diagnose you, but you could have a swollen lymph node from an infection of some kind, or a cyst, or of course something else I don't know about.  But it sure is not typical to have a cancerous breast lump that shrinks.  **If** it could happen, then I think it would deserve to be an article in a medical journal. This does not mean I am telling you not to be anxious or scared.  Our minds are not rational things all the time.  Some people, including me, can worry about something even if its 0.000X% incidence.  I was diagnosed with a long standing anxiety disorder shortly after my diagnosis. I bet everyone who is mentally healthy here was anxious going through the diagnosis stage, even if their diagnosis ended up being benign.  We all want to be ready for whatever is ahead for us.  Its totally understandable you are anxious. But I think the chance that you have breast cancer is very, very low. Feel free to vent or ask questions, OK?",

But the majority of women consider even this bracketing insertion very do-able.   In a survey I did, most people didn't have a pain score of more than 5/10 during this bracketing needle insertion before a surgical biopsy (this is NOT a core biopsy.)   However,  I have a history of trauma (which I didn't know at the time), so that made my experience different. Everyone is different, so I can't tell you what your pain experience will be.  I would highly encourage you, though, that **IF** you have pain, complain.   I didn't at my bracketing needle insertion because I wanted to be a 'good girl' and not complain.  That was a BIG MISTAKE.   Unlike at a needle insertion to 'bracket the lesion', at the stereotactic biopsy, I was only told to hold still for about 15 seconds at a time, and I could freely express anything I wanted between.   Again, if you have pain, make sure to COMPLAIN.",

(MRIs are expensive, if you are going to have a biopsy anyway.) Most women with breast cancer do not have pain as one of their symptoms, but some do. It is not a reliable symptom of breast cancer. But only you know how your breasts feel from the inside. If you really think there is something wrong, then insist on a biopsy no matter what the doc says.

I'm surprised that the surgeon said digital was no better than conventional. They may be slightly more expensive. I thought they reduced unneccessary radiation because they could manipulate the images by computer and avoid some further mammos. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm confused. Of course, we all want to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure. In Dr. Love's breast book , she says she was told by a radiologist that a current mammo gives you as much radiation as you would get from an airplane trip over Boulder, CO, or if you went nude sunbathing on a beach for 10 minutes, or until caught.

Breast surgeons are the experts at diagnosing *including benign diagnoses*.  They are the ones who most often see the symptoms and get immediate feedback about the diagnosis.   While the majority of women with breast cancer have a painless lump, breast cancer can present itself in different ways, so its good that you are getting it checked out with a specialist.  Only about 15% of women with breast cancer get it from a known genetic link.

On the first one, they followed up with a surgical excision, which increased the width to about 3/4 or 1 inch. I later found they went in inches in both directions in my breast during the surgical excision. Maybe I'm remembering the terminology wrong, or they have used the terms loosely. For me, the scars have improved over time. (My first core was 12-05.) For me, they have been much more attentive to my discomfort during stereotactics than they have during my one wire insertion. Women's experiences vary, but I think most find the breast pain tolerable. Some women with neck or back issues find it difficult as you have to be still for long periods.

Unfortunately, it is rarely possible to tell 100% if something is a breast cancer.  The 'gold standard' of diagnosis for breast cancer is a biopsy - in other words, for almost all breast cancers  (except inflammatory breast cancer - you don't have the symptoms for that) - they can't diagnose you with breast cancer before a pathologist looks at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  Even when you have a biopsy, it can be possible to miss the spot they want to sample, or something like that. Its a judgement call to decide whether or not something is suspicious enough to biopsy.    They normally look for changes in a mammogram.  Mammograms do not detect all breast cancers; they pick up about 80% of them.   If your first mammogram was not overly suspicious, they are probably looking at changes. The more 'negative' imaging you have (the more times they do not find anything suspicious), the more confident you can be that the area is not cancer. Most breast cancers have been in the breast for some 4-10 years before they can be detected by ANY means, including feel, mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI.  So most breast cancers are relatively slow growing. At my place, they have everyone who has a biopsy get a followup mammogram in 6 months to see if anything suspicious has happened, and to get a new 'baseline' for future mammograms. You can look at the BIRADS score.  You probably had a BIRADS 3 score since they are recommending a short followup. http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/types/mammograms/results.jsp My colleague has had at least 10 call backs over the years, and has never had anything suspicious enough to biopsy, let alone have any other breast problems.  Hang in there.  Feel free to ask questions or vent, OK?",

From what I understand, most of the lymphatic vessels around the breast do NOT drain through the bottom of the breast. Most of them drain through the axilla (around the arm/armpit), or maybe the middle of the chest. That's not where I feel most of the pressure in a bra. http://www.breastcancer.org/pictures/types/vascular_lymphatic_invasion.jsp www.springerlink.com/content/e...  I also believe that the upper, outer quadrant has a somewhat higher incidence of breast cancer.  That's not where I feel pressure in my bra.  In this abstract, looking at IDC and ILC only, they found 19% of the tumors in the lower quadrants, and ~80% in the upper quadrants. I'm not sure if the bra theory mandates location of the tumor in the breast, but the upper quadrants are not where most breast constriction occurs (due to gravity). www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18... So I think that's why they think there is NO association between wearing a bra and getting breast cancer - almost all of the lymph node drainage in a breast is to the arms and beneath the middle of the sternum - there is no/very little lymph node drainage at the bottom of one's breast where bras constrict.

Some families have very strong family histories (such as EVERY female in the family has gotten breast cancer), yet when tested, they are negative.  This means there are probably breast cancer gene(s), or combinations of genes, that infer a strong family risk.We don't know what genes these are, or if we do, they have not yet developed a commercial test.

I think its really important to get a 2nd pathology opinion if they were going to treat you differently depending on their results.  (Some breast surgeons/oncologists offer patients with ADH  tamoxifen treatment.)   Your treatment options may change if genetic testing shows you have a deleterious BRCA mutation.   Your genetic counselor should be able to advise you about your potential risk for a deleterious BRCA mutation. Part of your decision may be whether or not your insurance will pay for 2nd pathology opinion and/or genetic counseling/testing.   FYI: I have LCIS and ALH, and I ended up getting a 2nd opinion on the pathology.  I paid for the 2nd opinion out of pocket, but it ended up that my insurance paid for the 2nd opinion.  (My diagnosis only changed from classic LCIS with cells with characteristics of ALH to (on the 2nd opinion) classic LCIS with ALH.)  So my 2nd pathology opinion didn't change my treatment course.",

I'm not that super at statistics, but one way of judging how good a model is for an individual is the concordance value.  'Judging a model for an individual' means answering the question 'What is my risk of breast cancer over my lifetime', as opposed to the modified Gail model that can answer  'How many people in a population of X (say, 100,000) that have risk factors like me will get breast cancer?'  This opinion article said that the modified Gail model, and the modified Gail model that includes other risk factors such as breast density, will quite accurately predict how many women in a population will get breast cancer.  However, both models are 'better than a roll of the dice, but not by much' in predicting how well the model works for an individual.  (To be specific, the best model they tested, the modified Gail model + other risk factors including breast density correctly predicted about 59% of the population, as opposed to 50% of the population if the model was as good as chance.  The best model imaginable would give a value of 0% or 100%.) jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.full.pdf If the modified Gail model works this bad for individuals with 'average' risk factors in the 'general population' , just think how well it works for a much smaller population, such as those with ADH (even if the study had a much larger sample size). The article says that those who have a strong family history, such as a deleterious BRCA mutation, may be in a different category, and some risk models may work better for them as individuals. I do not have ADH; I do have DH, ALH and LCIS.  I've gotten lifetime risk factor estimates from '30 or 40%' to 'somewhere between 10% and 60%, but probably closer to 10% than 60%.  If you want anything more accurate, go to the literature.'  I haven't seen any academic papers that say that women with ALH, ADH, DCIS, or LCIS have a risk lower than that of the general population. So I think that the subject of breast cancer prediction for individuals (even in the general population) is in its infancy.  Its probably in the fetal stages for individuals with higher risk conditions.",

(My breast surgeon refused to consider doing bilateral mastectomies on me with LCIS and ALH.)   Even if, magically, they could remove all your ALH, that wouldn't necessarily remove your risk.  For LCIS (which is usually considered a more advanced case of ALH), when these people go on to get breast cancer in the future, they often get breast cancer not _at_ the site of the previously known ALH or LCIS, but in a different spot in the breast (or in the other breast).  So that's why ALH and LCIS are known as being a risk factor for breast cancer.  In a minority of cases, they think that LCIS can itself become breast cancer, but in a majority of cases LCIS patients never get breast cancer.  Unless you have other significant risk factors (such as 1st or 2nd degree relatives with breast cancer or ovarian cancer), or a history of radiation treatment (such as treatment for lymphoma) you aren't at anywhere in the category of 'high risk' in my opinion.  Some papers classify LCIS as 'moderate risk'. Its totally fine to ask your oncologist 'What is my risk for getting breast cancer?', but don't expect the answer to be an answer they know well.  I was shocked years after my diagnosis to find this academic opinion paper. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.... A synopsis of this paper is that, for the modified Gail model (which you are eligible to take since you don't have DCIS, LCIS or invasive) http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/, even when they add risk factors such as breast density (in the Decarli model), they don't get better than a 59% concordance rate.  I know statistics are awful, but what this means is they compared the group of women who got breast cancer and the group of women who didn't get breast cancer.  They took one random person from each group and compared their scores on the two models.  In other words, for 59% of the randomly selected pairs of women, the risk estimated for the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer was higher than the risk estimated for the woman who was not. Unfortunately, for 41% of the pairs of women, the woman with breast cancer received a lower risk estimate than her cancer-free counterpart. Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much. (A coin toss would be a 50% chance of heads and a 50% chance of tails.) This does NOT mean your risk of breast cancer is 50% or 59%.  This means that the modified Gail model, even when you added risk factors such as breast density, was 'right' 59% of the time, and was 'wrong' 41% of the time. The modified Gail model *is* accurate for groups of women.  If they have this much trouble in predicting which women will get breast cancer in the general population, just imagine what the database is for a woman with ALH or LCIS. Some people get 'Your lifetime risk for breast cancer is 58.3%'.  I got 'your lifetime risk is about 30% without tamoxifen'.  Another place said 'Your lifetime risk is somewhere between 10% and 60% but probably closer to 10% than 60%.' Unless you have a significant family history or had radiation treatment (not routine diagnostic chest Xrays), the state of breast cancer prediction is in its infancy.",

Some people have an excellent support system, and they tell everyone, and all goes well. Usually the woman will eventually encounter some people who can't handle her diagnosis, or her potential diagnosis.  They may or may not be the immediate friends or relatives of the patient. Sometimes there are other circumstances going on, such as a relative currently having a different but more severe crisis, or a person in ill health.  Some don't want to worry others. I do want you to think twice about telling people at work.  There are 2 stories I would like to share about work, one of a poster here, and one about myself. One poster here said when she had a mastectomy, her breast surgeon told her boss that she was suicidal.  (Don't ask me how this happened.  Its obviously against HIPAA regulations for a doctor to share the diagnosis with an employer.)  When she recovered from her surgery, she was not hired back.  She was single and thus lost her health insurance.  She was in the middle of treatment for invasive breast cancer. Yes, I think its illegal to discriminate against people for getting cancer, but I highly suspect that it does happen, with the reason that 'business is bad, we had to let her go.' In my own situation, I was diagnosed with classic LCIS and nothing worse (which is unusual).  In spite of the name (lobular carcinoma in situ) it is NOT normally considered cancer.   I work at the hospital where I had my breast excision.  The radiology clerk saw my diagnosis on my surgery sheet.  I work the graveyard shift, and late on the night before my surgery, interrupted in the middle of a very busy night, I was told by a co-worker that this radiology clerk (who was essentially a male stranger to me) 'recommended that I have bilateral mastectomies because he had a co-worker who had LCIS and that's what she did.'  I did not appreciate being told my private parts needed removal by essentially a male stranger in the middle of work. Some people do not have the capacity to hold information confidentially.  Some people cannot handle the fact that sometimes some friends or relatives have things go wrong with their private parts.  I have certainly said the wrong thing to other people, and have not held information confidentially.  Saying the wrong thing does hurt.   It can be really, really tough to find the right thing to say to a person.  Even if you just reply, \"I'm sorry you are going through this.\" or \"How awful\" or \"Yuck\", maybe you wouldn't feel supported with these words.  You might think 'I'm sorry' was making light of your situation, that 'How awful' or 'Yuck' was presuming how you felt about the situation - maybe you were feeling something else at the moment. To see other examples of things that are said to breast cancer patients, see threads such as 'the Worst thing people have said to you' community.breastcancer.org/for...   or the 'Dumbest thing people have said to you' community.breastcancer.org/for... I'm not saying these things happen to everyone; some people have absolutely excellent support systems.  I think most people don't know how good or bad their support system is until it happens to them.  For me, I have not told some relatives about my LCIS because it is a relatively minor threat and other family members are going through much more turmoil. Some women with a late stage diagnosis have not told their frail elderly parent because of the shock it may cause. So its an individual choice.",

My next stereotactic I had, about a year later, I had a much worse time.  Not surprisingly, I 'learned' from my bad wire insertion.  I did make it through, but they had to hold me in.   I would very much recommend , as the mods said, that you tell the radiologist and tech beforehand that you are very frightened of having pain, and to ask you if you are having pain.  They should try to make you more comfortable. If worse comes to worse, you can warn them that if your pain is not being controlled, then you are going to stop the procedure.  That's what I should have done during my bad wire insertion.  Instead, I didn't say anything  (they didn't ask either), which made me feel very much a victim.

The post-stereotactic mammogram I had immediately after the stereotactic was the most comfortable mammogram I had ever had.  (They did the mammogram to see if they got the 'worrisome calcifications' they were trying to biopsy.)",

It is important to make sure you have ADH and not DCIS.  They are treated differently, and they can be confused. 2) I would think it may be prudent to wait for the results of your 2nd opinion slide reread before trying to conceive.  IF you happen to have DCIS, then the usual treatments are (lumpectomy + radiation) or mastectomy.Radiation is not normally recommended in pregnancy. From what I understand, chemo is more 'doable' in pregnancy than radiation. 3)  I think it is certainly reasonable to get 2nd (or more) opinions.  If you have nothing worse than ADH,  then normally for ADH and nothing worse close monitoring is definitely an option.  (I assume you do not have a significant family history such as breast cancer in a first degree relative like mother, sister, father, brother, or ovarian cancer in a first degree relative.) If you are in Boston, John Hopkins is a renown breast center.    Is your surgeon a breast surgeon?   If your surgeon gives you trouble about wanting a 2nd opinion, then I would seriously consider 'firing' your surgeon.  You may be able to get a referral through your OB since you desire to get pregnant.  (I was able to get a 2nd opinion without a referral.)   If you get a 2nd opinion, they normally want ALL your records, and it can be expensive.  When I had a 2nd opinion at a major university (2007) it cost (out of pocket) about $500 for the 2nd opinion, and $550/biopsy to get the slides reread.  In my case, insurance did pay, the slide reread was $350/biopsy. I know this is very upsetting and confusing.  But I would recommend at LEAST that you get in the hands of someone with whom you feel comfortable.

You normally can't be diagnosed with breast cancer without a report from a pathologist who has looked at a piece of tissue under the microscope. (The unusual inflammatory breast cancer may be an exception, and is sometimes diagnosed on clinical grounds.)  If we could reliably diagnose breast cancer from the color, or other characteristics, then they wouldn't need a pathology report. So, unfortunately, we must wait for an answer from the pathologist.  We don't want the pathologist to be rushed and make a mistake.  But there's no arguing that waiting is awful.",

But there are very good reasons why its not good to remove everything that is questionable. Its all 'risk vs benefit'. Most of these 'thingies' turn out benign. Even if they decide on a biopsy, overall, about 80% of biopsies are benign, and at age ~40 that 80% figure is probably even higher. Some removal can cause scar tissue. Scar tissue makes future imaging harder to read. More extensive surgery generally creates more scar tissue, so a fine needle biopsy would rarely cause scar tissue, core biopsies can sometimes cause scar tissue, whereas surgical removal will almost assuredly cause some scar tissue. Another thing is that for some types of conditions, it doesn't really reduce your risk by removing it, as non-intuitive as it might sound. For example, don't expect to get what I have, which is LCIS, which is unusual. But they don't try to get clean margins for LCIS or atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH). That's because LCIS and ALH are thought to usually give you a higher risk for breast cancer, but are usually incidental findings found on biopsy, are usually multifocal (meaning there are usually multiple spots of it) and bilateral (meaning in both breasts.) LCIS and ALH are relatively unusual, so I wouldn't expect these conditions. They usually don't biopsy things that are rated as BIRADS 3. These lesions have about a 3% chance of being breast cancer. BIRADS 4 lesions are considered for biopsy, and have something like a 3-95% chance of being malignant. Different radiologists can rate imaging differently, but, also, we don't have the resources to biopsy everything that is BIRADS 3,4, or 5. We aren't doctors, and we don't know anything about how to evaluate your imaging. You probably aren't BIRADS 5, because the doc said *if* biopsy is necessary. Your previous imaging showed BIRADS 4. I don't know if the subsequent imaging changed your BIRADS score. But there are risks and benefits to everything. Its good to listen to your doc and see what (s)he says. Hang in there.",

If I moved, it would wreck the entire procedure. I did a survey here, and wrote 2 letters to the doctor (I work at the hospital where I had it done.) The doc left a message on my answering machine that they would try to use anesthesia beforehand. Other women who wrote (about their bad experience) got no reply. It traumatized me so badly, that at my next core (a year later), I was jumping when they were trying to even inject the anesthetic. In fact, I pulled out of the entire mammo machine.

In these cases they are not trying to excise all of the LCIS/ALH/ADH, but to make sure there isn't any DCIS or invasive in the area. In the case of LCIS, they are not aiming to remove all of the LCIS because of several reasons: a) LCIS is usually not detectable except by looking at the tissue under the microscope.  The breast surgeon normally doesn't know where LCIS is growing when they are excising.  So they wouldn't know where to excise.  LCIS is also usually multifocal (which means there are usually several  different spots of LCIS in a breast) and is often bilateral (meaning you have spots of LCIS in both breasts.) To 'get rid of all the LCIS' for sure, they'd have to do bilateral mastectomies, and even then they can't get 100% of the breast cells in a mastectomy. b) Even if your case of LCIS is NOT bilateral or multifocal, that makes little difference clinically, because even if you have one spot of LCIS in one breast, LCIS puts both breasts at risk. In some small (but no one will commit to a number) of cases LCIS may be a nonobligate precursor for cancer.  (DCIS is thought to be a cancer precursor.) http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/new_research/111005.jsp For DCIS, they want you to have clean margins (i.e. no DCIS at the edges of the tissue they remove.)  If they don't have clean margins, then they normally go back and do more surgery until they do, or they recommend mastectomy. They don't normally do chemo for DCIS, though I think with some very aggressive DCIS they can. Hi,Desdemona.  In your reference, I don't see the words 'very small' in reference to LCIS.They do say the majority of women with LCIS won't get breast cancer.  That means it is <50%.  I guess its a judgement call if you call anything <50% 'very small'.    I have been quoted incidences of 30-40%, which is<50%. These numbers are supported by the writing on this site, though another figure is 21% over the next 15 years. www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/...  I have seen estimates for ALH and ADH that their risk may be about half that of LCIS.

Among DCIS patients, incidence rates of ipsilateral and contralateral invasive breast cancer were 5.4/1000 person-years and 4.5/1000 person-years, respectively; and among LCIS patients, incidence rates were 7.3/1000 person-years and 5.2/1000 person-years, respectively. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16...

If you have DCIS, then they usually do (lumpectomy + radiation) or mastectomy.  Sometimes they follow this with tamoxifen.  Tamoxifen is contraindicated in pregnancy.  If you have invasive, then it depends on the characteristics ('personality' of your cancer), but for early stage breast cancer, they usually do (lumpectomy + radiation) or mastectomy, with or without chemo, with or without tamoxifen or other antihormonals. DCIS covers a wide range of 'personalties': from very mild to quite aggressive.  But DCIS alone is not invasive. Tamoxifen is normally taken x 5 years. You should not be pregnant while on tamoxifen.  I'm on tamoxifen (for LCIS.)  The usual  LCIS treatment options are: close monitoring, close monitoring + tamoxifen/antihormonals, or prophylactic bilateral mastectomies.  The latter is usually reserved for women with a horrible family history of breast/ovarian cancer. From what I've been reading, it sounds like mucous type benign lesions are at most low risk. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...  Its hard to put numbers on anything, and even if they did statistics can be really misleading.  For example, with my LCIS (which is considered more advanced than ADH or ALH), I have gotten numbers from various sources that my lifetime  risk of breast cancer is 10-80%.  That's a big range. My oncologist and genetics counselor gave me a lifetime risk of about 30-40% which is probably more accurate. Statistics programs can be really tricky. Statistically, they know fairly well in a population about how many women will get breast cancer.  For example, in a city the size of Florence, Italy, they were able to closely predict how many women in that town would get breast cancer.  However,  they are VERY POOR  at predicting WHICH PARTICULAR INDIVIDUALS  in the town would get breast cancer.  How bad?  If you predict with a coin toss, it should be 50% (which is something like the concordance value)(if the coin is fair.)  If you had a model that predicted correctly 100% of the time the  concordance value would be 100%.  The Gail model, or other models that try to improve on the Gail model including breast density, etc, are used, the concordance value is about 59%.  This is better than 50%, but not by much. If you only have ADH, then the numbers I have seen usually suggest people who only have ADH as a group have a much lower lifetime  risk for breast cancer- maybe about half of people with LCIS. (You can put your numbers into the Gail model.) www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/  But again, note that this is for the population AS A GROUP with your characteristics, not you individually.  But its probably the best we can do. Here's some info about breast cancer and pregnancy.  I know you don't have a personal history of breast cancer, but I can't find articles that specifically address your situation.  In any event, you would want a consult to weigh in on this anyway.

(In other words, the maximum times they can predict an 'average' individual will or will not get breast cancer correctly is <60% versus 50% of the time for a random coin toss.) The point being is that though it would be very helpful to make your decision based on 'numbers' - e.g. 'What is my risk for getting breast cancer?', we really do not know that number for YOU.  We know the risk well for groups of fairly normal women (probably including women with ADH and ALH), but not individual women in those groups. Here's more info about a large study comparing tamoxifen and raloxifene for breast cancer prevention.  As others have said, its about a 50% reduction in risk. This information of course is for groups of women, not individual women. http://www.nsabp.pitt.edu/STAR/Index.asp",

Breast cancer is much more uncommon in males than in females, of course. A BRCA mutation often carries a higher risk of ovarian cancer. The BRCA genes can also pass along a  lower tendency for other, non-gynecological cancers.  Most (not all) BRCA-related breast cancers occur before menopause. The person most qualified to evaluate your daughter about a possible hereditary breast cancer gene would be a genetics counselor, usually found at major institutions. Overall, only about 10-20% of breast cancers are thought to be due to a gene mutation, the most common being BRCA.  About 70% of breast cancers are thought to be from unknown/non-obvious risk factors (besides being a woman), at least in the United States.",

Another consequence- if a person has a bad experience with a procedure, people will stop getting screened, because they know if they 'find something', they are at risk for a repeat of this procedure.When I wrote my 2 letters to the radiologist, he replied that 'He'd have to inject some sodium bicarbonate each time.'  Whatever that means.

Stereotactic just means they use a computer to guide the needle so it will hit the area they want to reach.  They 'triangulate' (use coordinates) to find the area they want to biopsy.  (Its sort of like treasure hunting and using a compass to find the area they want to biopsy, except they don't use magnets.)  I think they normally use stereotactic mammogram-guided core biopsy when your lesion shows up best in a mammogram. For me, tiny ice packs were better than the pain pills they gave me.  I had it done in the morning, drove myself home, and went to work that evening (I work the graveyard shift.)",

I have heard of some women who have had mastectomies on an outpatient basis, and did not stay overnight. I think its common for many lumpectomies to be outpatient (not over night.) I went back to work 24hours after I was discharged from my excisional biopsy, which might be considered like a lumpectomy.

Well, as always, its a risk vs benefit situation if you're pregnant.  For me, the noise was like being right next to a jackhammer.  Some people also have problems with it being enclosed.  I didn't-they put a damp towel over my eyes.  You also have to lie still.  Any Xray is radiation.  Mammograms are Xrays of the breast, but the dose is very small for modern mammograms.  One radiologist said the dose of Xray you get from a mammogram is about that of going nude on a beach for 10 minutes or until caught, or being a passenger in a plane that flies over Denver, Colorado (about 1 mile up).  Chest Xrays have much more radiation than modern mammograms. ",

I know I was petrified and crying at home and at work when I knew they were actually considering I might have breast cancer. We all want to be prepared for what it ahead of us. So its natural to think of the worst case scenario. I bet most of us did that. The worst case scenario is very, very, very unlikely. It is OK to feel whatever you are feeling, but I just want you to be safe mentally and physically. If you are having trouble with this, then there is absolutely no shame in contacting your doctor and asking for a sedative, if that is what would make you feel more comfortable. Its very stressful. Its so easy to worry, and you will worry until you have worried enough. But if you need some help, make sure you get the help you need.

I'm thinking if there is a progression of the cells, I must be closer to the LCIS/DCIS than the \"typical hyperplasia\" end of things. Does that ring true for you or is there a flaw in my logic? I don't know about the 'progression' part, because we don't really know the natural history of ALH/LCIS.  That means we don't know the 'pathway' (if there is one) between ALH, LCIS, and invasive breast cancer.  We don't know if 'everyone' who has invasive breast cancer started with ALH and/or ADH.  This is controversial, as in all  things LCIS. This paper opines there is NOT a low grade pathway between LCIS/DCIS and invasive, but that is only one paper. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21935747 This is a hard subject to study, because we don't know who is out there walking around with ALH, ADH, LCIS and don't know it, because these are all usually incidental findings found on breast biopsy.    But with LCIS, the minority of women who do later go on to get breast cancer usually (not always) get breast cancer in areas that look NORMAL (by mammogram or ultrasound).  This is a very old paper (1993)  Among patients with LCIS, invasive carcinoma happens anywhere in the breast parenchyma.  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/82...  In addition, LCIS is normally multifocal (meaning there are lots of spots of it in a breast) and usually bilateral (in both breasts.) (Classic) LCIS used to be routinely treated with bilateral mastectomy (before, say, the 1990s or so.)  When they found that early stage invasive breast cancer could (usually) be treated with lumpectomy and radiation, many surgeons thought that routine mastectomies for  LCIS was overkill (in the absence of a strong family history.) They think that LCIS can, in a small number of cases, directly become invasive.  As in all things LCIS, there is controversy. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15... LCIS, ALH, and (I'm guessing ADH) are normally found as an incidental finding on a biopsy.  LCIS is often  (not always) found not at the lesion of concern (i.e. what prompted the biopsy), but adjacent to the lesion. You weren't diagnosed with this, but besides the classic LCIS (which I have), there is the much more unusual PLCIS (pleomorphic LCIS) which has some features of both LCIS and DCIS. PLCIS wasn't described until the late 1990s or so, so we don't know much about it.  Classic LCIS was first described in the early 1940s. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15... The genetic couselor said 50% lifetime risk, since my mom was diagnosed at 27, died at 29, and her sister died at 47 (i.e. both premenopausal.) I am very glad you got a 2nd opinion at a prominent medical center (Vanderbilt).  I have heard it is usually simple to tell invasive bc from non-invasive bc, but it can be tricky to tell ADH from DCIS. I would say you definitely have a strong family history, and that your genetics counselor's estimation is on track.  (Your genetics counselor, at least if board certified, is certainly a better expert than I.)  In my own genetics counseling, I was not given an idea how little we know about risk assessment.  You have a strong family history.  I don't know if you have been tested for a BRCA mutation, but if you haven't then you could be at risk for one.  That strong family history risk 'trumps' any risk you might have from ALH/ADH, or if you had DCIS or LCIS.  (Some BRCA mutations confer up to a 84% lifetime risk of breast cancer up to age 70.)www.uspreventiveservicestaskfo... Also the genetics guys said the ALH would not show up on an MRI, but it should at the point it is LCIS. MRI shows a lot of 'junk' (stuff that looks suspicious but is NOT breast cancer, such as inflammation), and MRIs can see LCIS, but I doubt if it always does.  If you do have LCIS, though, that isn't all that important, because they treat ALH about the same was as LCIS.  I think your risk of getting breast cancer due to your strong family history is much more important. I'm not really sure I understand the LE risk with PBMx. In my case I don't think they would need to check the lymph nodes, but can they \"happen\" to damage them thus causing the LE?  I watched a mastectomy operation on utube and it looks like they are really close to the lymph nodes near the pectoral muscles. I've never watched a mastectomy operation.  I had bilateral carpal tunnel surgery, which can mess up the lymph vessels in the hands, as well as other medical issues I'd rather not go into.   I'm no expert on lymphedema.  This article says Published incidence rates for BCRL <breast cancer related lymphedema> vary substantially with a range of 2-65% based on surgical technique, axillary sampling method, radiation therapy fields treated, and the use of chemotherapy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21945108 This abstract doesn't describe the breast surgery and breast cancer treatment well, but found significant problems in returning to recreational activities. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735276 Binney4 is our resident expert on lymphedema  (I know there are others, but Binney has received awards for her work), and this is what she says about lymphedema risk on a prophylactic mastectomy.  It sounds like the risk is low but NOT zero.  http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/64/topic/777425?page=1#post_2690657 I started out with an every 6-12 month check, but after 2 or 3 years, I'm now down to yearly mammograms and twice-a-year clinical exam.  I think that's because I'm now 6 years away from LCIS diagnosis, and if I had any missed invasive cancer at diagnosis, it would have shown up by now. (I.e. I have a VERY low risk now of having an invasive cancer that was not detected when I was diagnosed with LCIS.) Farmerlucydaisy: you are in a different category since you have a strong family history, and I think it certainly makes sense to strongly consider mastectomies when you have a strong family history. But only you can judge what your treatment choice or surveillance should be.  Some women with a known deleterious BRCA mutation choose watchful waiting, and that is a perfectly valid choice for them.  Others choose prophylactic mastectomies for a known  deleterious BRCA mutation, and that, too, is a perfectly valid choice.",

No one can diagnose you with breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope (except perhaps for the unusual inflammatory breast cancer - you don't have the symptoms of inflammatory breast cancer.) So, no, not even the most prominent breast surgeon can tell for sure whether or not you have breast cancer.

NOTE: This claim of being 'more accurate than the Gail model for women with a markedly positive family history' is NOT a  breathtaking feat.  In real life applications, the Gail model (in women who do NOT have a personal history of breast cancer) has a less-than-breathtaking concordance statistic of about 0.6. For those unfamiliar with the concordance statistic, it takes a random person from the group (in this case) who never had breast cancer, and compares the model prediction with a person who DID end up having breast cancer.   If the model worked as well as a coin toss, it would have a concordance statistic of 0.5.  If the model worked perfectly, it would have a concordance statistic of 1.  So, for the Gail model with a concordance value of  about 0.6, about 60% of the time, the person with breast cancer would get a higher score than the person without breast cancer.  However, about 40% of the time the woman withOUT breast cancer would have a higher score than the person who ended up having breast cancer.

Some women are understandably too frightened to get anything checked out.  The mother of one of my friends had a breast lump for years, and waited until it ulcerated to go to the doctor because she was too frightened. By then, of course, it was far advanced. Some women are just too frightened to get anything checked out. In my grandmother's day (1950s) breast cancer was not talked about.  That's because at that time, breast cancer *was* (nearly) an automatic death sentence.  It is *NOT* now. ",

Its perfectly fine to be concerned about how you will look cosmetically.  This is YOUR one and only body, and YOU will be living with the outcome.  It sounds like you'd be glad to get an answer from your surgeon.

I know that ducts as they go back into the breast can be very convoluted, and look like a sagebrush, except the ducts almost never interconnect. Since the ducts are usually convoluted, but the incisions are straight, could part of the blood be from the incisions crossing more than one duct? I think it would be very prudent to call up your breast surgeon so they can share with you what they think is going on. I hemhorraged from my biopsy.

These large fibroadenomas most commonly happen in younger women: sometimes they are called juvenile giant fibroadenomas. But obviously, they can occur in middle aged and older women too. This recent report is of an 84 year old with a breast fibroadenoma, and she did have a history of breast cancer. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27096476 But, as you were told, it is unusual for older women to get fibroadenomas. As far as why, there are lots of things we don't know, but since fibroadenomas are pretty common in younger women, it is thought one factor may be hormonal changes. Presumably you are past menopause, so, unless you are taking estrogen or progesterone, that wouldn't be a big factor for you. Some people just don't fit into strict categories. I have one condition (not breast related) where the doctor said it looked like the pathologist made up the diagnosis because it didn't fit cleanly into any category. There are lots of academic papers that are looking at different tissue factors that may affect breast tissue growth. There is a lot we don't know about breast cancer and why we get what we do. Since it is causing you anxiety, you may want to get a 2nd opinion, or at least talk to the doc who ordered your mammogram and sonogram. If you do have it removed, one down side is that removal will cause scarring, which will make future mammograms/imaging harder to interpret. But some fibroadenomas can 'hide' lesions beneath them.

There are people who smoke that don't get lung cancer.  There are people who are exposed to the HIV virus but don't get HIV disease.   But there is certainly much more of an association between smoking and lung cancer. They know the carcinogens that are in smoke, and they know the presence of HIV virus in the bloodstream is highly associated with HIV disease. For example, as far as I know, in Japan, when women bound their breasts, the incidence of breast cancer wasn't higher than what it is now.  As far as I know, in Victorian England, when women wore corsets, the incidence of breast cancer wasn't higher than it is now.  The death rate was certainly higher, but I don't know of evidence of even an association between breast constriction and breast cancer.  Women who breastfeed (and get their breast chewed, etc. during breastfeeding) don't have a higher association with breast cancer - in fact breastfeeding is associated with a lower incidence of breast cancer.  When women want to stop breastfeeding, sometimes they bind their breasts. So manipulation/constriction of the breast is not associated with breast cancer, as far as I know. Bras don't constrict lymph flow of the breast in any significant way.   You might as well associate breast cancer with wearing something over one's torso. I don't think that cultures where women go topless have a lower incidence of breast cancer.   Many English speaking women  in English speaking countries circle F for their gender when required to do so.  That doesn't mean that  the act of circling F causes breast cancer.  Being a woman IS a strong risk factor for breast cancer. Association is not causation.  But you need to have an association to even propose a causation. Many women wear bras. I don't know of an association between bra-wearing and breast cancer.

      "Content": "Jan 8, 2012 04:57PM - edited Jan 8, 2012 05:07PM by leaf Hi there!  As I usually say about LCIS, there is little about LCIS that is NOT controversial, including the name.  That creates uncertainty, but that also means its hard to choose wrong (providing you are given choices.) I have classic LCIS, ALH, and DH (ductal hyperplasia, not atypical).  The LCIS + 'features of ALH' were found at my first biopsy after a routine mammogram showed 'suspicious calcifications'.  I was 51 at diagnosis, as you. A 2nd opinion upgraded the 'features of ALH' to 'ALH'.  The DH was found at a subsequent biopsy a year later. I have a 'weak' family history, with only 2nd degree female relatives who all had postmenopausal bc. My breast surgeon from the get-go refused to do any further surgery beyond the excision after the LCIS/ALH core biopsy.  There weren't any other breast surgeons in my network.  At the time, I was also having carpal tunnel issues and ended up having bilateral carpal tunnel surgery.  This might put me at higher risk of lymphedema if I had PBMX.  I now have other medical issues that make any decision even more complex if I go on to have something worse than what I have now. Some papers combine LCIS and ALH and put them both in the category of LN (lobular neoplasia).  LCIS is at one end of the spectrum of LN, and ALH is at the other.  They usually think that LCIS has about twice the risk as ALH.  I wanted to do something, so I went on tamoxifen.  I just completed my 5 years of tamoxifen.  I had 4 endometrial polyps (roughly every 1-2 years), one starting before I went on tamoxifen, all were benign.  According to the NCI site regarding LCIS and the choice of tamoxifen:  In women older than 50 years, this benefit was accompanied by an annual incidence of 1 to 2 per 1,000 women of endometrial cancer and thrombotic events. (Refer to the PDQ summary on Breast Cancer Prevention <www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pd... for more information.) Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy is sometimes considered an alternative approach for women at high risk for breast cancer. Many breast surgeons, however, now consider this to be an overly aggressive approach. Axillary lymph node dissection is not necessary in the management of LCIS. http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/treatment/breast/healthprofessional/page5 Obviously, there are many women here with LCIS (classic or pleomorphic), or ALH or ADH who do not agree with this notion and choose PBMX.  Not ALL of these women have a dreadful family history.   Yes, ALH puts both breasts at risk.  I assume you have had a surgical excision?  Some, but not all, docs recommend that in order to help reassure there isn't something worse there (i.e. LCIS, DCIS, or invasive.) www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18... But 'high' is a relative term.  Some academic papers categorize LCIS and ALH as 'high risk' whereas others categorize LCIS as not high risk (at least LCIS/ALH without a strong family history, usually described as a first degree relative, especially if pre-menopausal.) Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), together described as lobular neoplasia, are associated with substantially increased risk of subsequent breast cancer, with lifetime risk estimates ranging from 10% to 20%.45 This equates to a continuous risk of about 0.5% to 1.0% per year. The invasive cancers may be ipsilateral or contralateral, are usually invasive lobular cancers, and more than 50% of these diagnoses occur more than 15 years after the original diagnosis of LCIS. Similar findings have been reported by Fisher et al,46 describing a 12-year update of 180 women with LCIS who were treated with local excision alone and followed by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP), as well as Li et al, who described the risk of invasive breast cancer among 4,490 LCIS patients using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data between 1988 to 2001.47onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10... This '10-20% lifetime risk' is lower than my onc and genetics counselor stated.

The only way someone can diagnose a person with breast cancer is to look at a piece of tissue under the microscope. So I would push for a biopsy. There are 3 major kinds of biopsies. One is a fine needle biopsy, which can be done in the office, one is a core biopsy that takes larger samples (they use plenty of anesthetic), and the last is an excisional biopsy that is a surgical procedure.

These are the US Preventative Services Task Force Recommendations for family histories that warrant consideration of testing for BRCA1 and BRCA 2. (From Annals of Internal Medicine, 2005: 143: 355.) Ashkenazi Jewish Women: a. Any first degree relative with breast or ovarian cancer. b. Two second degree relatives on the same side of the family with breast or ovarian cancer. Non Ashkenazi Women: a. Two first degree relatives with breast cancer (including one diagnosed <=age 50) b. Three or more first or 2nd degree relatives with breast cancer. c. Both breast cancer and ovarian cancer among first and 2nd degree relatives. d. First degree relative with bilateral breast cancer. e. Two or more first or 2nd degree relatives with ovarian cancer. f. A male relative with breast cancer. An article opines that a recent meta-analysis showed women who test positive for the BRCA1 mutation have a 57% of developing breast cancer and a 40% risk of developing ovarian cancer before age 70. Those that test positive for BRCA2 have a 49% risk of developing breast cancer and an 18% risk of developing ovarian cancer. It says that clinically important BRCA mutations have been found in about 2% of Ashkenazi Jewish women, and are estimated to occur in about 1 in 300 to 500 women in the general non-Jewish US population. I have a weak family history with postmenopausal bc in grandmother on one side and aunt on the other side. The genetics counselor said my risk of having a BRCA mutation was probably about 2%, about the same as the average Ashkenazi Jewish woman. I think the reason I was referred was because on one side my grandmother (who had bc) had only sons, so it would be masked if there was bc in that generation. This article opines that *in general* women with no family history of bc or ovarian cancer should not be tested. It also points out that the onset of cancer in BRCA mutation carriers occurs at an earlier age than in the general population. I read on these boards one woman who had NO family history of breast cancer and DID test positive for a BRCA mutation. So it is possible to have a BRCA mutation with no family history. Its just very unlikely. Thinking of you.",

The word is slightly imprecise, as some can, due to mass effect, cause life-threatening complications.\" medical-dictionary.thefreedict... One example of where a benign tumor might be life threatening is in the brain. There isn't much extra room in the skull. If something takes up space, it means something may be in danger of getting squished out. The only sizable hole in the skull is at the bottom, so you can have increased pressure on the brain. The brainstem lies there, which controls essential things like breathing. So 'benign' brain tumors can be deadly because of their location. Some breast conditions can be pretty ambiguous. I have LCIS (lobular carcinoma in situ). Even though it has the word 'carcinoma' in the name, most, but not all, oncologists consider it a benign condition. But there is little about LCIS that is NOT controversial. Does that help?",

Just think of having a 5 pound sack of flour in one breast. Just to play devil's advocate, surgical excision  can cause scarring which can make it more difficult to monitor your breasts in the future.  When I had my breast excision after a core biopsy that showed LCIS, I told my breast surgeon to go 'all over' my breast to make sure there wasn't anything worse in the vicinity.  (LCIS patients are more at risk for ILC, which is also know as 'the sneaky one' - in other words its hard to detect since is often doesn't form a lump.  I, with a weak family history, was given about a 30-40% lifetime risk of invasive breast cancer; but there is a LOT of uncertainty about this figure; my 2nd opinion said it was 10-60%, but probably closer to the 10% side  rather than the 60% side especially since I opted for tamoxifen.) I didn't realize until about 2 years later that the surgery left so much scar tissue that a 2nd NCI certified 2nd opinion said that in my case I should not have an MRI, not even a baseline one, because I had so much scar tissue.  I have 'dense, but not extremely dense' breasts per the radiologist.  I had a 2nd core biopsy 1 year after my excision that was inches away from  my surgical excision and it 'was consistent with scar tissue'.   I'm not saying you should or should not have a surgical excision; I'm just pointing out that there are consequences for each decision you make.  You will make the right decision for you; I just want you to be aware of potential consequences. P.S. You will probably have a LOT LESS scarring than I had on my surgical excision, because they will be able to feel your lump and locate it. In LCIS patients they are probably more on the look out for pulling of different areas, which may be an ILC, which is something they have to see and not feel, so they probably have to disturb more breast tissue. But you probably will have *some* scarring, to some degree, which could make it more difficult to see things in that area in the future.",

I have read figures like mammograms pick up about 70% of breast cancers.   You may not want to read the following (it is scientific):  ********  There are 2 words that might be helpful: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity (in statistics) is (in this case) the number women who do have breast cancer  and their mammogram detects the cancer. If we just consider mammograms:  Specificity (in statistics) is (in this case) the number of women who do NOT have breast cancer and them mammogram does NOT detect the cancer (because there isn't any cancer to detect). If you have a 100% figure in both instances, then you have a perfect (or at least near-perfect) test in this regard. The people that DO have breast cancer and the mammogram (in this instance) says they are normal are 'false negatives.' The people that do NOT have breast cancer and the mammogram (in this instance) says they DO have breast cancer are 'false positives'. In reality, mammograms are rated on a scale called BIRADS.  A BIRADS score of 5 means that the mammogram is typical of cancer (in other words, about 95% of the women whose mammogram looks like this have cancer.)  A BIRADS of 4 means not typical of cancer, but has a reasonable chance of being cancer.   So in reality mammograms don't give you an 'absolute' yes or no answer.  Imaging is NOT perfect.  Different studies differ, but just to post the first ones I could find:  In this study, the sensitivity and specificity of mammograms varied between about 60-95%.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11002452 In this study on ultrasound, you can see the numbers of positive people under various conditions. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18...  ********  The more imaging  that is rated as 'negative' that you get, the higher your chances of having a benign condition.  While there are some women here who were diagnosed with breast cancer after having a negative mammogram, ultrasound, and MRI, that is unusual. There are 4 major ways that breast cancer is detected (before a biopsy): clinical exam (whether or not prompted by symptoms reported by the patient) mammogram ultrasound MRI There are women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer with 3 out of these 4 being negative (in other words, only 1 out of the 4 is positive), but that is  quite unusual.  The person who has the final say in diagnosing breast cancer is the pathologist.  (In other words, you can't be diagnosed with breast cancer before a pathologist says you have breast cancer.) Anyone in your shoes would be scared.  If you weren't scared or anxious or angry or disturbed at some level, then you would be in denial, or have some sort of mental illness, or something. ",

Fibroadenomas don't make it significantly more likely you will get breast cancer. You shouldn't have to ask for more tests.  Likely the surgeon will either do a fine needle biopsy right there in the office or order an MRI or order a core or excisional biopsy.  If the lump is readily accessible, and large enough, then its probable they will do a fine needle biopsy right then and there in the office.  I've never had one, but I've heard that generally they are painless. If the doctor doesn't order a biopsy or MRI, then you can insist on one.  Dr. Love in her breast book says that if you are convinced that something is wrong, then insist on a biopsy. ",

There is a lot we don't understand about the development of breast cancer.  But breast fibrosis is common, and has not been linked to the development of breast cancer. breast-cancer.ca/miscellaneous...

If you have extremely lumpy breasts, then it can be harder to do a breast exam, but besides this, I don't think there's any big correlation between lumpy breasts and breast cancer.  I have never had a breast lump (except scar formation after breast surgery), but have LCIS. However, if you develop a breast lump, make sure to get it checked out, at least if it doesn't change after a menstrual cycle.

It has predictive value only for women over age 35 who have not previously been diagnosed with breast cancer,67 and it does not incorporate specific genetic risk factors. Although it is highly accurate at predicting the aggregate number of women within various age or other risk groups who will develop breast cancer within 5 years, its ability to predict which individual women will develop breast cancer is only slightly better than chance.60 It is, nonetheless, used to assist in determining whether individual women should engage in cancer prevention measures, because there are no better models that have been validated for individual risk prediction. (emphasis mine). http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22312/ Even different breast cancer risk model differ. In this paper, of 3 breast cancer risk models, Our analyses found that of the 5,894 women in this study, 342 (5.8%) were eligible for MRI by at least one of the models. There were large differences in the number of eligible women by each model. Most notably, the Tyrer-Cuzick model identified 330 (5.6%) of the study population to be eligible, whereas the BRCAPRO and Claus models identified many fewer eligible women (25, 0.4% and 54, 0.9%, respectively; Fig. 1). Surprisingly, only 13 women (0.2%) were identified to be eligible by all 3 risk models. When the BRCAPRO model results were adjusted to approximate the additional risk of DCIS, we found that these results changed slightly (Fig. 2). This adjustment identified more than twice as many women (61 women, 1% of the study population). Yet, the overlap between the models changed very little with only 18 individuals (0.3%) identified by all 3 models. (emphasis mine) http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/22/1/146.lo If they have this much trouble predicting the risk of women in the general population, just imagine the trouble they have in ONE woman who have some type/risk factor not included in the model. Even if you define 'high risk' as >X%, they sure don't know the value of X very much at all for any individual person. So if someone gives you figures about your risk of breast cancer, they sure don't know that number very well AT ALL. ",

In Dr. Susan Love's book (p. 320) she describes 'The Unknown Primary'. This is a cancer that has spread to a lymph node in the armpit without an obvious primary tumor. In women, this type of tumor is almost always in the breast. She says this is a rare type of breast cancer, accounting for less than 5% of cases. She says the patient typically shows up with an enlarged lymph node, usually in the armpit. Its biopsied and we find breast cancer cells but there are no breast lumps. Usually the woman is first sent for a mammo and ultrasound. If that doesn't show anything, they try an MRI. In situations where no breast lesion can be found, she says the treatment can be more controversial. She says that contrary to what you might expect, survival rate in cancers that show up in the nodes but not in the breast is actually a bit better than for cancers that show up both as a breast lump and an enlarged node. In this age of antibiotic resistance, it is certainly possible to have an infection that doesn't respond to the antibiotic you are taking. Hang in there. The waiting is horrible.",

Now, probably they didn't know about obesity as a risk factor when the Gail model was formulated. Breast cancer risk was 55% greater in obese women older than 60 compared to younger women. http://www.breastcancer.org/research-news/20111206 Now, in the general population, breast cancer is diagnosed in about 1 out of 8 women during their lifetime (about 12%).  Do all obese women get breast cancer?  No, of course not.  Roughly, roughly, even if you take this 13% and multiply it by 1.55 you get about 20%, or about 1 in 5.  This is an overestimate because about half of breast cancers occur in women younger than 60.  I don't know what the numbers are for women younger than 60, but it sounds like its not 55%. But, about 1/3 of the US population is considered obese. http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html Has the breast cancer incidence gone up? Breast cancer incidence rates in the U.S. began decreasing in the year 2000, after increasing for the previous two decades. They dropped by 7% from 2002 to 2003 alone.   http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/understand_bc... Now, of course, breast cancer incidence might increase in the obese population, and some other factor might decrease the incidence even more.  But you'd think if 1/3 of the population has a risk factor for something that was significantly high, then that might increase, not decrease, the breast cancer incidence. I'm not a statistician, and these numbers are quite rough anyways.  Maybe my logic and methods aren't very good.  But if you are in your 20s, then obesity alone may not be as big a risk factor as you think it is.  Its so easy to go to the 'worst case scenario', and its easy to be angry when you have all this uncertainty.",

The only kind of atypia that I know of that is not ADH is ALH.  Even the Mayo clinic only talks about ADH and ALH as the types of atypical hyperplasia in the breast.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/atypical-hyperplasia/DS01018 If I have the scenario right, then I'm really confused what the doctor is saying.  If its atypia, and its NOT ADH, then why didn't they just say that its ALH? Or is the surgeon disagreeing with the pathologist?",

      "Content": "Dec 23, 2014 10:43PM - edited Dec 23, 2014 10:50PM by leaf I have both LCIS and ALH, which was found on a core biopsy. (LCIS is normally regarded as higher risk than ALH, roughly almost twice the risk. Histologically, LCIS is a more 'extreme' case of ALH; some places group LCIS and ALH together and call the group 'lobular neoplasia'. This is partly because it is sometimes hard to draw the line between ALH and LCIS because its a continuum.) I had a subsequent excision of the area, which removed about 2 tablespoonfuls of tissue, and showed nothing worse than what I already have. I have a weak family history, with several aunts and a grandmother on the other side of the family having postmenopausal breast cancer. My breast surgeon refused to do any further breast surgery on me. I was given a lifetime risk of breast cancer of about 30-40%, though that is a very soft figure (in other words, they don't know that number well at all.) It took a few months for the swelling and bruising to go away. After about year 2, I have to really, really search to find the faint pink scar, which is less than 1 inch long. (I have a B cup.) I had every 3-6 month screenings for the first 2 years or so (because I had 2 additional breast biopsies, and at my place after a biopsy they do more imaging 3-6 months after each biopsy.) I haven't had any more breast biopsies or imaging call backs after year 2. After about year 3, I'm down to twice-a-year clinical exams and yearly mammograms. (That's what the NCCN recommends for LCIS.) I took 5 years of tamoxifen. Last year my oncologist said she doesn't want to see me anymore. Most LCIS is multifocal (meaning it occurs in multiple spots in one breast) and is often bilateral (meaning it occurs in both breasts.) They know this because before about 1990, they used to routinely treat LCIS with prophylactic bilateral mastectomies, and they could look at the mastectomy specimens. So, even though they removed my one spot of LCIS and a spot of ALH, it is highly likely that I have other spots of ALH and LCIS in my breasts. We don't know what causes ALH or LCIS, or how it confers increased breast cancer risk. But just because you had 3 spots of ALH does not necessarily mean you are at higher risk than a person who only had 1 known spot of ALH. I probably have 3 spots of ALH and/or LCIS, but the only way they could tell is if they biopsied all of both breasts, which essentially means a mastectomy. I took tamoxifen for 5 years. It really wasn't bad for me. I had benign endometrial polyps every 18 months while on tamoxifen, but I also had benign endometrial polyps before I took tamoxifen. At first I had some mild 'warm' flashes, but I was peri-menopausal anyway. Tamoxifen experiences differ; some have no adverse effects whatsoever, and some have horrible adverse effects. If you have little to no adverse effects on a medication, you are much less likely to post about them. So you can't take the number of posts on this board and say they represent the population of people who take tamoxifen. So, depending on your particular risk factors, you may not need to be screened with imaging every 6 months for the rest of your life. In the study cited by the moderators above, roughly 16% of the study group (both ALH and ADH) ended up getting invasive breast cancer. Yes, since this study covered women diagnosed from 1967-2001, the 16% is probably an slight underestimation of the risk, since it is likely that many of the women diagnosed in the latter portion of this period are still alive, so they didn't measure their lifetime risk. (The average age to diagnose LCIS is in one's 40s or 50s.) But still, it gives you an idea. Remember, the lifetime risk for 'average, run-of-the-mill' women in the USA to get breast cancer is about 13%. Remember, most women who get invasive breast cancer will not die of breast cancer, but will die of something else. Of course, no one wants to get breast cancer. But depending on your other risk factors (mainly family history of breast/ovarian cancer, particularly pre-menopausal in 1st degree or 2nd degree relatives), you may have a lower risk than you think.",

Both biopsies showed scar tissue, and they were 2 inches from the site of my previous excision. In these biopsies and excisions, they can travel all over your breast, much more widespread than you would ever imagine. I thought I started have nipple direction change starting about 1 month after my excision. I ended up with a us 3 months post-excision, mammo and us at 6mo, and another mammo and us at 12 mo. It was all scar tissue. But I will say, you may want to eventually get it checked out.

I'm not certain what the situation is with ADH, but I'd be surprised if the 'standard of care' for ADH was they needed to remove it all.  But I may be wrong, and will be happy for someone else to correct me.",

Some like other antiemetics that are related to Compazine (for example perphenazine.) (Besides the family of Zofran (ondansetron), Anzemet (dolasetron), and Kytril (granisetron).) Its rather curious about Compazine - it was first developed in hopes of curing intestinal worms (in about the 1950s.) They tried it out on people in mental institutions (since they can be more prone to worms), and found it helped with psychoses. (So the general family is known as anti-psychotics.) Then they found in psychotic patients who also had nausea, it helped with their nausea. By the late 1990s, it was used almost exclusively for nausea and vomiting, and was only rarely used for other uses in the general hospital. Until they stopped making the injectable form, so they couldn't use it in the hospital after operations for several years. Now its back, but usually other drugs are used first in the general hospital. One drug can sometimes have many uses. Ativan can be used for sedation, anxiety, seizures, nausea, muscle spasms (not a complete list I'm sure.)",

When I had brackets placed before my excision, I had pain of at least 9/10, although this is quite uncommon per a survey I did here. No one should have to go through that kind of pain. I think it is much more likely that you are having pain from your biopsy than pain from your breast marker. Obviously, they use a needle that cuts breast tissue when you have a biopsy. It is common to have pain at the site of most surgeries. It is common to have 'electrical shocks' after a breast biopsy/surgery. I had a marker inserted after my core biopsy, and the marker was removed at my excision. I certainly had plenty of 'electrical' sensations after my excision, and there was no marker present. Most people think its because nerves in the breast can be cut when you have a biopsy or excision. The 'electrical' sensations gradually decreased over time (several months-years) for me. If a breast marker can help prevent putting in a bracket (like a pin so the surgeon can locate the 'area of concern'), personally, I'd rather have a breast marker put in. Before my excision, I had 2 brackets (pins) inserted. This was more painful than my previous core biopsy (partly I'm sure because of the attitude of the radiologist). You may want to talk with your radiologist whether they'd need to put brackets in if they end up needing to excise this area. Every person is different, so your situation, choices and preferences may be different than mine. I just want you to have less pain.",

      "Content": "Dec 13, 2011 09:04AM - edited Dec 13, 2011 09:36AM by leaf Yes, I have.  I was completely freaked out, because I had had a difficult wire incision (prior to an excision) the year before.  In addition, the ultrasound-guided biopsy was just under my nipple, which is the most sensitive part.  I was also freaked out because there was evidence of this weird thing some 1.5 years prior.  So I was afraid I had this for many years undiagnosed.  (Note that most people think that most breast cancers have been in the breast for some 4-10 years before they can be detected by ANY means.) My one ultrasound guided biopsy for me was way easier than my two stereotactic mammo-guided biopsies.  On all of my biopsies, I drove myself home, and went to sleep and went to work that night (because I had my appointments in the late morning, and I work the graveyard shift.)  At my place, it was darkened (so they could see the screen better), and they used warm ultrasound gel.  It was actually somewhat relaxing (at least before the needle insertion.) Personally, I found tiny ice packs and a jog bra were more effective for post-biopsy pain than pain meds.  But your experience may be different.  We are all different people. I wore a jog-bra for a few days. At the time, I was still jogging, and I avoided doing that for a week or so.  Your nurse or doc will give you specific instructions at your biopsy how long you need to keep your bandages on, and when to shower.  (They tend to vary from doc to doc.) Nevertheless, you will have your own experience  and your experience will be valid.  Your emotional history, and previous history with breast biopsies (if any) can really play a part in your experience.  (I had a perfectly tolerable stereotactic the first time, but my second time was much worse due to the intervening awful needle insertion.)  Most people have at least a tolerable time after biopsy.  (I have additional emotional issues.) What you might do, before they start the biopsy, is to tell them that you are concerned about possible pain, and that you want a lot of anesthetic.  Hopefully, they will take more concern in this area.  I know you are concerned about spreading by the biopsy.  This is understandable considering what your mom went through. The last time I looked (about a year or so ago), they thought that while in many cases, if a woman does have invasive breast cancer, these cells are often moved along the needle track line,  they think that most of the time that these cancer cells do NOT survive their new location. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21...  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19... This paper claims to have a 0.7% incidence of seeding. **IF** you end up having invasive results, then it may be good to a) at subsequent surgery have the needle track excised - at least if the surgery is close to the time of biopsy or - b) have radiation or mastectomy or other systemic or 'standard' therapy. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20...  If you do end up having cancer, it is a good question to ask your breast surgeon and oncologist. Now, in some unusual conditions, puzzlingly, it probably doesn't matter - such as in my relatively unusual case.  I was diagnosed with LCIS and nothing worse.  LCIS is normally multifocal (meaning it is normally found in several spots in the same breast) and often bilateral (occurring in both breasts).  But also, LCIS is not normally considered cancer (in spite of its name.)  LCIS usually 'just' puts you at higher risk for breast cancer. I also want to play 'devil's advocate' for a moment.  When I had my excision, I also wanted it ALL out!!! I'm not trying to tell you what you should do, or what decision you should make, but  do know that apparently my breast surgeon did go 'all over my breast', including inches away from the incision.  In subsequent biopsies, there was scar tissue.  I was told by one 2nd opinion that I was not a candidate for a breast MRI (to monitor for further breast screening) because I had too much scar tissue.  So there are consequences for every decision you make.  I just want you to know some of both the risks and benefits of your choices.  Its YOUR and YOUR SURGEON'S call, not my call.  Of course you are terrified.  Anyone would be terrified in your shoes.  We're here with you every step of the way!",

Even assuming that you can accurately evaluate your risk (which I don't think you can very well- at least for you as an individual), how high is high? I've quoted this paper many time before. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.... Its about the modified Gail model, which automatically excludes both you and me. Its meant to predict the average breast cancer risk of a group of women (without breast cancer) with certain risk factors. Unfortunately, its a really poor model for predicting the risk of any certain individual. I figure that if they know this little about predicting risk for an 'average' group of women without breast cancer, just think how well they know the risk of a person who has some risk factors? I know they know practically zip about LCIS, but I have seen or gotten lifetime risk predictions for breast cancer that range from 10% to 90% (the 90% in a non-peer reviewed calculator.) That's a pretty wide range. In ONE paper, in different places they described LCIS as a 'high risk' and a 'moderate risk' condition. I would imagine that having a mastectomy greatly reduces your risk, but there are always some breast cells left. Some doctors say things in notes in order to get insurance to pay for them. I have LCIS and sometimes my gyn described me as having breast cancer, even though almost no oncologists would (or should). (I was having a D+C for uterine polyps when I was taking tamoxifen.) Sometimes the people who are reviewing surgeries and treatments do not know all that much. I certainly remember an infectious disease specialist (MD of course), and he was challenged by the insurance company about an antibiotic treatment he recommended. The insurance company suggested a cheaper antibiotic. He pointed out that the antibiotic the insurance company was suggesting did not cover that particular bacteria! All this is very anxiety provoking, especially when you are newly diagnosed. But as you learn more, eventually most people come more to terms with their situation.",

Maybe things are different at your place.   I got the total of the equivalent of 3 seconds with an ice cube for anesthesia (a cold spray on my skin), then the wire was inserted.  When the doc saw my face, he injected the area with lidocaine, which hurt as much as the wire insertion.  He never checked if my pain was reduced, which I'm sure contributed to my pain score.  I always do much better if there is some 'human connection' with the person; they somehow acknowledge that I may have some discomfort. I did a survey here in 2006, and this is what people said: 38 people responded to my survey.  People were able to choose only one of the 4 following responses. 1) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)   19 people, 50% 2) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  7 people, 18% 3) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  3 people , 8% 4) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10.) 9 people, 24%.

We all have different personalities and handle this differently.  For me, if I have to ever have another one, I will make some arrangements with the radiologist before the procedure, and bring something like a bell or a rattle to shake if I am in significant pain. Probably most women are able to tell the radiologist if they are in pain, but I was not.  (Plainly the majority of women in my poll had a pain score of <=4/10.) Of course I wish you a pain-free procedure.    (I have prior trauma issues, so I am probably NOT the norm.) Once a real anesthesiologist got involved, it was totally fine.  I had conscious sedation during the surgical excision.  I used tiny cold packs at home after the excision. I went to work 24 hours after my procedure.  I probably would have felt better if I was out an additional day, but it was 'do-able'.  (I don't usually have to lift anything more than 5 pounds at work.) As Bessie said, Hoping for nice clear definitive benign results this time!",

I am not a pathologist, but I think it is usunual for surgeons to make *guesses* whether a sample looks like cancer or not *looking at the sample with the naked eye*.   This wikipedia article describes the process of preparation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histology After they slice it, the  pathologist has to look at it, and someone has to type up the results. For most people who have posted on this site, it ordinarily takes at least several days before they have the results available.  For one unfortunate woman, they sent the slides to another institution for a 2nd opinion (without telling the patient), and it took about a month.  I had a routine breast biopsy, and it took me 3 full days. Yes, it is possible to have cancer cells in a fibroadenoma, but in this one study in Tunisia, the incidence was quite low. The incidence of a carcinoma within adenofibromas is estimated at 0.1 to 0.3%  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18...  That means that about 1 to 3 people out of 1000 people had an adenocarcinoma in their fibroadenoma.  Another study reported 6 cases.  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10...  I can assure you that if they write a report saying they found 6 cases of something, that means it is quite unusual.

I know high risk precancerous may scare the dickens out of you, but the risk is usually thought to be much LESS than the risk for BRCA women. I have LCIS and ALH, and they have estimated my lifetime risk as between 10 and 60%. My onc estimated my risk without tamoxifen as about 30%, or about 0.5-1%/year. There are studies that support the 0.5-1%/yr figure for LCIS. I think it is usually thought that the risk for ALH and ADH women (with nothing worse and a weak family history) is much less than LCIS, maybe half this or less. I have read papers that LCIS confers the biggest risk of breast cancer of any benign condition that you can see under the microscope, so your risk will almost assuredly be not more than that of LCIS (unless perhaps you have a bad family history of bc.) However, due to statistical stuff which is not easy to understand, these numbers (like 0.5% per year) are for the POPULATION that might be similar to yours, but is NOT valid for the individual. In other words, these risk numbers might be valid for a population that has your risk factors, but in the case of breast cancer, they are VERY POOR for estimating the risk that YOU as an individual will get cancer. In other words, they are NOT of very much value to make clinical decisions about YOU. Make sure you get a copy of your pathology report so you know what you are dealing with.

I thought the only women who get breast cancer were women who ignored their lumps.)   But, the vast majority of these 'thingies' turn out to be benign.  They can't diagnose you with breast cancer without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  And overall, particularly for younger patients (you would be considered young for breast cancer) - the overall number of biopsies that turn out to be benign in the USA is about 80%.  That's a big number. Hard lumps can be deep cysts.  (Cysts are almost always benign.) Most (not all, but most) breast cancers have been in one's breast for some 4-10 years before it can be detected by ANY means.  So they're usually fairly slow growing. Hopefully, you will pass all of your screenings, and quickly go back to living your life. Waiting is hard.  Some women find distraction helps.  Some women have to wait for months to get through the entire diagnostic process. Here's a link to the overall diagnostic process. Some people have some things in a different order than they present here. http://imaginis.com/breasthealth/diagnosis.asp Please feel free to ask questions or vent.  ",

I didn't know I had early childhood abuse (including neonatal) until months later, when I got into therapy. During the wire insertion (immediately before breast excision), I did have a pain score of 9/10 (not 10/10 because I'm sure it would be worse if they were tearing off my arm). My previous biopsies were NOT as bad because the (different) radiologist was much more caring. I realize you didn't have any pain issues. I will have to have another wire insertion in the next few weeks/months. Good for you to tell your providers so they can be prepared. Know that no matter what, you have the option of walking out of there. At least that gives you some sort of sense of control. I was told before the wire insertion that I have to 'promise not to move a muscle'. Of course, I didn't know what was coming. If I would have told them my distress I would have cried, and if I cried I would have moved. At the time I couldn't verbalize anything. A friend of a friend (who I don't know, hence I don't know if she had a history of abuse) called the wire insertion 'barbaric', and I will use that descriptor if I do have to walk out. I don't know if they have better pain control now. Since it was immediately pre-surgical, and they didn't have an RN who could monitor, I couldn't have any oral or IV pain relievers. Since I got to a pretty non-verbal state of withdrawal, next time I will bring a bell or shaker along, and if they hear that, they should know I'm in distress. I will also lather up my breast with a bunch of topical lidocaine. (I know you didn't have any pain issues.) If you are still in therapy, you may also consider asking your therapist how best to handle. It doesn't matter what anyone else's experience is, if you are 1 out of 1 thousand or 1 million people who has this severe of a reaction. (That's the way I felt.) It only matters that your experience is valid! I'm not talking about pain AFTER the procedure (which was handled quite well with ice packs); I'm not talking about addiction. I'm talking about pain/distress DURING the procedure.",

We are not radiologists or physicians (at least I am not), so it is hard to say. But I did do a Pubmed search and found these studies.

Links Accuracy of sonographically guided 14-gauge core-needle biopsy: results of 715 consecutive breast biopsies with at least two-year follow-up of benign lesions. Crystal P, Koretz M, Shcharynsky S, Makarov V, Strano S. Department of Radiology, Soroka University Medical Center, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.B. 151, Beer-Sheva, 84105, Israel. pcrystal@bgumail.ac.il PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to examine the diagnostic accuracy of sonographically guided 14-gauge core-needle biopsy (CNB). METHODS: Sonographically guided 14-gauge CNBs of 715 breast lesions were performed in 652 patients. Histopathologic results were correlated with imaging findings, and repeat biopsy was recommended in the cases of discordance between the radiologic and pathologic results. Long-term follow-up was used for patients with CNB findings of a benign lesion. RESULTS: Sonographically guided CNB revealed malignancy in 311 lesions (43%). Thirty-one lesions with CNB findings indicating benign conditions underwent additional image-guided or excisional biopsy because of indeterminate pathologic features, disagreement between radiologic and pathologic results, surgeon preference, or patient request. Within these 31 cases, 9 malignancies were diagnosed. The duration of follow-up for the remaining 373 benign lesions varied from 27 to 60 months. In 3 of these 373 cases, carcinoma was diagnosed at the site of CNB. The false-negative rate of 14-gauge sonographically guided CNB was 3.7%, and the sensitivity of sonographically guided CNB for the diagnosis of breast cancer was 96.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Sonographically guided 14-gauge CNB is a safe and accurate method for evaluating breast lesions that require tissue sampling. Radiologic-pathologic correlation and follow-up of benign lesions are essential for a successful breast biopsy program. 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

False-negative core needle biopsies of the breast: an analysis of clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings in 27 concecutive cases of missed breast cancer. Shah VI, Raju U, Chitale D, Deshpande V, Gregory N, Strand V. Department of Pathology, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, Michigan 48202, USA. BACKGROUND: A benign diagnosis in a core needle biopsy (CNBx) of the breast performed for a clinically and/or radiologically suspicious abnormality is often due to a nonrepresentative sample. However, the discordance may not be recognized, resulting in a logistic delay in the diagnosis. METHODS: Twenty-seven false-negative CNBxs were identified in 952 consecutive CNBxs of the breast (653 benign, 266 malignant, and 33 atypical) performed during a 1-year period. Biopsies were analyzed with respect to clinical and radiologic findings, biopsy type, type of malignancy, and interval between the original CNBx and final diagnosis. Four hundred thirty-eight (67%) of the patients with a benign CNBx diagnosis either underwent excision or had a minimum of 1-year follow-up (mean, 35.6 months; median, 36 months). RESULTS: The cancers missed on CNBx included 6 ductal carcinomas in situ, 17 invasive ductal carcinomas, 3 invasive lobular carcinomas, and 1 non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The overall false-negative rate was 9.1%. For palpable lesions, ultrasound-guided CNBx had a lower rate of missed cancer (3.6%) compared with CNBx without image guidance (13.3%). The false-negative rate for vacuum assisted CNBx biopsy was 7.6% (3.3% for the 11-gauge needle, 22.2% for the 14-gauge needle; 5.6% for nonpalpable mass lesions, 8.2% for microcalcifications). In all seven false-negative CNBxs performed by radiologists, the discordance between the radiologic and pathologic findings was promptly recognized due to their standard follow-up protocol. The discordance between the degree of clinical suspicion, radiologic impression, and the pathologic findings was not immediately recognized in 5 of 20 false-negative CNBxs performed by surgeons (4 without radiologic guidance and 1 with ultrasound guidance), resulting in a delay in the diagnosis ranging from 112-336 days. CONCLUSIONS: A false-negative diagnosis of breast carcinoma was found to be more common in CNBx performed without image guidance but occurred to a lesser degree in image-guided biopsies. A delay in diagnosis can be avoided by establishing a standard post-CNBx follow-up protocol. Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.

Klinische Abteilung für Radiodiagnostik I, Univ.-Klinik für Radiodiagnostik, Anichstrasse 35, 6020 Innsbruck/Osterreich. PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective analysis was to assess the diagnostic accuracy and complication rate of sonographically guided core needle biopsy in palpable breast masses, mammographically detected nonpalpable lesions, and sonographically detected clinically and mammographically occult lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sonographically guided core needle biopsy was performed in 590 lesions in 572 patients, by using an automated biopsy gun with a 14-gauge large core needle and a coaxial system. Core needle biopsy results were compared with surgical biopsy in 265 cases. 325 lesions with benign histologic diagnoses were followed up for at least 18 months. RESULTS: 234 carcinomas and 356 benign abnormalities were found in the 572 patients. Core needle biopsy reached a sensitivity of 98.7% at a specificity of 99.7%. Underestimation rates for lesions initially diagnosed as DCIS and for lesions initially diagnosed as ADH were 3/10 and 6/14, respectively. Of three false-negative results, two were immediately recognized, and one was identified at follow-up. Serious bleeding occurred in one patient (0.2% complication rate). CONCLUSIONS: This report confirms that sonographically guided large core needle biopsy is a safe, reliable and cost-effective method for the assessment of both palpable and nonpalpable, mammographically and sonographically detected breast abnormalities. PMID: 11930538 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Many women here believe that the best lump is the lump in the jar, and to follow your suspicions. Since you have a new lump, I definitely think every lump needs to get at least evaluated. Did you see a breast surgeon? It is an individual choice, but I would have an uneasy mind too, and want the lump(s) out.

Most young women (and you are a young woman at age 30 for breast cancer purposes) have dense breasts. But the risk of breast cancer for young women is low. The mean age to get breast cancer is in one's early 60s. Dense breasts makes it harder to read mammograms. Besides the visual problem in mammograms, there may in addition be something about dense breast cancer tissue that makes it higher risk. Before you freak out at the next quote, please note that 3-5 fold increased risk does NOT NOT NOT mean 3-5 x 13% lifetime risk = 36-65% lifetime risk; 3-5 fold increased risk means 3-5 times the risk of the average woman *without any particular risk factors besides being a woman*, which is on the order of 3-5%.  So 3-5 x 3-5 = about 9-25% lifetime risk.The 'average' woman in the US has about a 13% lifetime risk of getting breast cancer. Studies have shown that women who have extremely dense breasts have a three- to fivefold increased risk of breast cancer compared with women who have mostly fatty breasts. www.cancer.gov/aboutnci/ncican... (emphasis mine). This website also points out there is some controversy about the exact amount of excess risk.",

Imaging is not 100% sensitive or specific.  That means that when they find something on imaging (such as mammogram, ultrasound, MRI) it can pick up stuff that isn't cancer (specific.)  You can also have negative imaging where there actually is cancer there (sensitive.) That's why some (luckily rare) people can have a negative mammo, ultrasound, and MRI, but still have a breast cancer.   The more 'negative' imaging you have, the more likely you do have a benign condition.   They can't diagnose you with breast cancer without looking at tissue under the microscope.",

The only SURE way of diagnosing a lump is by biopsy, which is why some wise women here say 'The best lump is the lump in the jar'. Dr. Susan Love in her book says that if you really think there is something wrong in your breast, then insist on a biopsy, no matter what the doc says. She says if you are wrong, you will have peace of mind, and if you are right, you may have saved your life. Cancer can have many different textures. Most breast cancers present as a painless lump, but just about any scenario is possible. Most cancers show up on either mammo, ultrasound or MRI. But there are a few women here who have had cancers that did NOT show up on mammo, ultrasound, or MRI. This is VERY unusual, but it can happen. Imaging is NOT perfect, but its the best we have. I was surprised to find out that deep cysts can also feel hard. But usually ultrasounds are pretty good at telling if a lesion is fluid filled or not. I had suspicious calcifications. On my first ultrasound, they recommended biopsy. When I went in for an ultrasound-guided biopsy, they couldn't find it under ultrasound. So they did a mammo-guided biopsy. They found LCIS, with is quite unusual (without anything worse.) Usually LCIS (by itself) does not show up on any imaging, but most people don't consider it cancer, either, in spite of the name.",

So this study may NOT be applicable to you. This is a study of young women who have already had breast cancer, have no known contralateral breast cancer, and choose to have a mastectomy on the other breast.   RESULTS: Most women indicated that desires to decrease their risk for contralateral breast cancer (98%) and improve survival (94%) were extremely or very important factors in their decision to have CPM. However, only 18% indicated that women with breast cancer who undergo CPM live longer than those who do not. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers more accurately perceived their risk for contralateral breast cancer, whereas women without a known mutation substantially overestimated this risk. CONCLUSION: Despite knowing that CPM does not clearly improve survival, women who have the procedure do so, in part, to extend their lives. Many women overestimate their actual risk for cancer in the unaffected breast. Interventions aimed at improving risk communication in an effort to promote evidence-based decision making are warranted. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24042365 We are all different, have different risk factors, and are in different situations.  I totally respect everyone's choice for their treatment.  I just want people who choose prophylactic mastectomies to fully understand why they are making their decision.",

Anyone in your shoes would be scared. We were all scared going through this process. You are NOT alone. But remember, no one on this round earth of ours can diagnose you with breast cancer before they take a piece of tissue and look at it under the microscope. Only about 10% of breast cancers are genetically linked to family genetics. It sounds like they are probably getting you prepared to have a biopsy. In my opinion, that is good, not bad. A biopsy is the gold standard way of really finding out the nature of your mass. Any kind of imaging can be wrong. That's why many ladies here say 'The best lump is the lump in the jar.\" We tend to be proactive here. Make sure you read the next sentence. Remember, 80% of biopsies are BENIGN. That is a BIG number. Lobular is an unusual type of breast cancer. It often grows in sheets, and is usually slow growing. It can be 'sneaky'. So if they suspect lobular, then its even more reason to want a biopsy, to get answers. But no doctor can diagnose you with lobular breast cancer, or any other kind of breast cancer, without looking at the tissue under the microscope.",

I'm just telling you this so you can have the 'worst case scenario' for waiting that I've seen on these boards. We all want to be ready for what goes on.  In my case, the time between my routine 'suspicious' mammogram and my excision was 3 months.  It took them 2-3 weeks to inform me there was something suspicious (BIRADS 4). Many find distraction helps.  I think there's a lot more pleasant way to get house repairs!  Please know we're thinking of you.",

Different studies differ, but this gives you some flavor about the specificity and sensitivity of breast MRIs.   In this case, false positive means that the MRI says you have something suspicious when you really are OK; false negative means you do have breast cancer when the MRI says you don't.  Obviously, false negatives are of more concern. In this study of 216 patients, 62 malignant lesions were found.  There were 3 cases where MRI did not pick up the malignancy. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20707656 In this study, 7 out of 220 patients had MRIs that did not show the cancer.  In a population of 220 sequentially diagnosed breast cancer lesions, we found seven (3.2%) MRI-occult cancers, fewer than seen in other published studies. Small tumor size and diffuse parenchymal enhancement were the principal reasons for these false-negative results. Although the overall sensitivity of cancer detection was high (96.8%), it should be emphasized that a negative MRI should not influence the management of a lesion that appears to be of concern on physical examination or on other imaging techniques. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20489112 As debbie said, biopsy is the 'gold standard' - you can't be diagnosed with breast cancer without a pathologist looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope (except perhaps for the unusual inflammatory breast cancer- you don't have those symptoms.)  But biopsies do have their downsides; fine needle biopsies can miss the lesion of concern and distort the tissue, but excisional biopsies (surgical removal) can cause scar tissue, which makes it harder to read future imaging when you are screening later.",

According to the above website, last reviewed in 2010, has an incidence of about 10%.  This book says in the UK they classified fibroadenomatoid hyperplasia with fibroadenomas.  http://books.google.com/books?id=WfM3romKun8C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=fibroadenomatoid&source=bl&ots=qQx2Ni1XL3&sig=6i2kN7JC66iG6B2DiXxGXlPKqe8&hl=en&ei=1LN3TYv4NIegsQPU05G5BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=fibroadenomatoid&f=false Here, they describe fibroadenomas. www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/disea... Before you freak out about increased risks in breast cancer, the increases they are talking about are NOT NOT NOT times the ~12% ( the '1 in 8' ) lifetime risk of breast cancer in the USA, but increases compared to a woman WITHOUT any obvious risk factors (besides being a woman).  This 'baseline' risk of a woman WITHOUT any obvious risk factors is about 3-5% lifetime risk.  So even *if* you had a 2 times risk factor, that would be 2 x 3-5% = about 6-10% lifetime risk, which is LESS than the ~12% lifetime risk for the 'average' USA woman. Some places refer to fibroadenomatoid changes as being unusual, so I can't find anything specifically about how much risk it imposes.  But since at least one place classifies fibroadenomatoid under fibroadenoma, the risk looks to be small. They often want to have fibroadenomas removed not because they think they are cancerous, but so they won't block any future detection of lumps.  Surgery, however, does create scar tissue which can make  it harder to read future breast imaging.  It sounds like fibroadenomatoids ?often don't have a well-defined border, so they might be harder to locate?, but assuming they can locate it well, the excision would be the same.",

I have LCIS, ALH, and a weak family history, and I have been given quotes from 'closer to 12%' (from a major institution) to about 30% (from my onc) to up to 90% (without tamoxifen) from a breast risk calculator that has NOT been compared to the appropriate populations, and is almost certainly NOT accurate for some groups.  www.halls.md/breast/gailmods.htm  Almost every paper I have read opines that LCIS has a higher risk than ALH, yet probably the 'average' risk that I've seen quoted for LCIS is about 30-40%.  http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/types/lcis/cancer_risk.jsp It is important that risk calculators compare their predicted numbers with the appropriate population.  In other words, if you have ALH and started menstruating at age 15, and had your first child at age 35, then they should compare the figures they get for you with people who have those same risk factors (ALH, menstruating at age 15, first child at age 35.)  Additional risk factors are NOT necessarily additive.  This means that if you have 2 risk factors, that does NOT automatically mean you can add your risks together to get the final result.  In fact, for example, in alcoholism, it is known that alcohol is a risk factor, but when they studied women who drank AND had some other risk factors (I can't remember which ones), their risk did NOT rise. There is also the issue that they can know a risk for a group quite well, but be very uncertain what an individual's risk is.  One medical editorial called the Gail model risk assessment as 'better than the roll of a dice - but not by much.'  http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/98/23/1673 There is also the trick of percentages.  If your risk is decreased by 50%, it makes a lot of difference what your baseline risk is.  For example, if a treatment  X has a 1 in 100 chance of having some unpleasant side effect but cuts your risk of the disease by 50%, and your risk for the disease is  0.5%, then 50% of 0.5% is 0.25%.  That is a small absolute decrease in your risk. However, if your baseline risk for the disease is 40%, then treatment X,which halves your risk, will decrease your risk of the disease to 20%. Depending on what the unpleasant side effect is, you will have to decide if treatment X is for you. I waited 6 months after my LCIS diagnosis to start tamoxifen. Part of this is because it took 3 months to get an initial appointment with my onc.  But, assuming you had excisional biopsies, there is no huge rush to make a decision. Another advantage to antihormonals is : If you decide you don't like them after you start taking them, you can stop.  ",

I've never had an inverted nipple, but this ancient study (from 1982) says in their sample of 63 cases of  recent inverted nipple that 5% turned out to be carcinoma.  That means that 95% were benign.  Those are pretty good odds in my book.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/70... .  If your inverted nipple was long-standing, then there would be even a much lower risk of breast cancer than 5%. Its so easy to go to the worst case scenario.  We don't know where these symptoms will lead.  We aren't doctors, and even if we were we couldn't diagnose you.  You don't  seem to have the typical symptoms of IBC.  Since you are going to have a breast biopsy of your lump, you are, naturally, hyperaware of anything in your breasts.   When you have your visit, you can ask your breast surgeon about your symptoms and ask if they are anything you should be concerned about.  You can ask him/her if they need to investigate it further.  I would imagine that *if* the nipple inversion was of concern they might take a biopsy of it.  Of course, we don't have the expertise to make that judgement. So your chances are high that this will be something 'boringly benign'.  I know this doesn't necessarily reduce your anxiety because you will say, \"But what if I'm in the X% where its not benign?\"  No matter how low your  chances are, there is a chance it could be something significant.  But most of us do not worry about being killed in a car accident on our way home.  This is something new for you, so its natural to be worried. Many people find distraction helps.  Some clean, or meditate, or exercise, or go shopping.  I couldn't do anything I liked, but I could do things I hated.  Some people ask for anti-anxiety meds.

The Hall calculator assumes that risk factors are additive:  that, for example, if you have a strong family history and started mestruating early, then your risk is higher than either factor alone.  This MAY or MAY NOT be true. Dr. Hall does stipulate that while his calculator is based on journal figures, his calculator has NOT been compared to the actual populations.  For example, if you have both LCIS and started menstruating early, he has not compared the risk that the calculator predicts with the actual group of people who both have LCIS and started menstruating early.  Because LCIS is an unusual condition, they don't know the risk very well. In addition, even if you are at average risk, and not using Hall's calculator, but are using the Gail model (which HAS been compared to the respective populatons), the number you come up with is pretty accurate for the group with your features   **BUT** it does a really ROTTEN job in predicting YOUR breast cancer risk. jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re... In brief, the Gail model *is*  better than a coin toss for predicting if you will get breast cancer.  In this test, they compared the Gail model score of one random woman with breast cancer and a random woman  withOUT breast cancer.  If the Gail model was perfect, every women with breast cancer would have a higher score than  the random woman withOUT breast cancer and have a 'concordance' figure of 1.  If the Gail model was rotten, and had no predictive value at all, it would have a 'concordance' figure of 0.5.  The Gail model in this paper had a concordance figure of about 0.58.  So, yes, the Gail model is better than the toss of a coin, but not by much.",

Department of Surgical Oncology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, the Netherlands. BACKGROUND: The value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosis and size assessment of ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS) and DCIS with small (<10 mm) invasive carcinoma was evaluated. METHODS: Fifty-four patients with DCIS and 12 patients with DCIS and small invasive carcinoma were included. Mammographic (N = 64) and MRI (N = 22) images were retrospectively reviewed. Correlation coefficients were calculated to assess differences in size between imaging and histopathologic examination. RESULTS: Mammographic rate of detection for DCIS was 48/52 (92%) and for DCIS with small invasive carcinoma, 10/12 (83%). MRI revealed 1 false negative case and the rate of detection for DCIS was 16/17 (94%). Correlation of mammographic size with histopathologic size was r = .44 (P < .01) and r = 0.49 (P = .03) for MRI. Mammography underestimated lesion size by 5 mm or more in 47%, whereas with MRI size was adequately assessed in 43% and overestimated in 38%. CONCLUSIONS: DCIS can be visualised on MRI with high sensitivity, although tumor size can be overestimated.

Department of Radiology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53792, USA. ea.sadowski@hosp.wisc.edu PURPOSE: To determine the chance of malignancy in lesions classified as \"probably benign\" by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in a heterogeneous population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reports from 473 patients, from March 1994 to March 2002, who underwent breast MRI were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 79 patients (17%) had lesions classified as probably benign after the MRI, which required further imaging follow-up. We evaluated subsequent MRI, mammographic reports, and clinical follow-up in these patients and established the frequency of malignancy in this group. RESULTS: MRI classified probably benign lesion were diagnosed in 79 women because of focal or diffuse mild enhancement and benign dynamic enhancement curves in the area of the mammographic abnormality, or because of the presence of microcalcifications on the mammogram, or because of incidental enhancing lesions. Two-year radiographic and/or clinical follow-up was available in 68 women. On follow-up, four women (6%) were diagnosed with cancer between 14 and 18 months after the initial MRI. CONCLUSION: Patients with a lesion assessed as probably benign by dynamic contrast enhanced MRI have a higher chance of malignancy than patients with probably benign lesions (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 3, BI-RADS 3) seen on mammography. These patients should be informed of the increased risk of cancer and be given the option of biopsy or close follow-up.

Department of Radiology, Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Langenbeckstrasse 1, Germany. teifke@radiologie.klinik.uni-mainz.de PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and characteristics of malignant breast lesions not identified with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast tissue specimens were obtained in 464 of 967 patients who had undergone dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted fast low-angle shot three-dimensional MR imaging of both breasts. A comparison of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of the prospectively recorded findings of mammography, ultrasonography (US), and MR imaging with the histopathologic results was performed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. MR imaging examination findings that caused a false-negative diagnosis were reviewed to identify possible sources of error. RESULTS: Histopathologic analysis revealed 244 benign and 354 malignant lesions. The sensitivity values for mammography, mammography combined with US, MR imaging alone, and the combination of all three modalities were 73.7%, 88.1%, 88.4%, and 95.5%, and the areas under the ROC curves were 0.744, 0.829, 0.850, and 0.876, respectively. Twenty-eight (8.4%) of 334 invasive and 13 (65%) of 20 intraductal carcinomas were missed with MR imaging. In eight cases, motion artifacts (n = 1), tumor location near or beyond the outer boundary of the field of view (n = 3), inadequate infusion of the contrast material (n = 1), and masking of the tumors by intensively enhanced surrounding glandular tissue (n = 3) were identified as adequate explanations for the false-negative results. The remaining missed breast cancers (n = 33) exhibited very diffuse growth patterns or were 5 mm or smaller. CONCLUSION: MR imaging did not depict 41 of 354 malignant tumors for several reasons.

Riedl CC, Ponhold L, Flöry D, Weber M, Kroiss R, Wagner T, Fuchsjäger M, Helbich TH. Department of Diagnostic Radiology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. christopher.riedl@meduniwien.ac.at PURPOSE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of mammography, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast in the surveillance of women at high risk for breast cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this prospective comparison study, women at high risk for breast cancer were offered annual surveillance examinations, consisting of mammography, ultrasound, and MRI, at a single tertiary care breast center. The sensitivity and specificity of each modality was based on the histopathologic evaluation of suspicious findings from all modalities plus the detected interval cancers. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-seven women underwent 672 complete imaging rounds. Of a total of 28 detected cancers, 14 were detected by mammography, 12 by ultrasound, and 24 by MRI, which resulted in sensitivities of 50%, 42.9%, and 85.7%, respectively (P < 0.01). MRI detected not only significantly more invasive but also significantly more preinvasive cancers (ductal carcinoma in situ). Mammography, ultrasound, and MRI led to 25, 26, and 101 false-positive findings, which resulted in specificities of 98%, 98%, and 92%, respectively (P < 0.05). Thirty-five (35%) of these false-positive findings were atypical ductal hyperplasias, lesions considered to be of premalignant character. Nine (26%) of those were detected by mammography, 2 (6%) with ultrasound, and 32 (91%) with MRI (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Our results show that MRI of the breast improves the detection of invasive cancers, preinvasive cancers, and premalignant lesions in a high-risk population and should therefore become an integral part of breast cancer surveillance in these patients.

Department of Surgery, Stanford Cancer Center and Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is highly sensitive for breast cancer. However, adoption of breast MRI is hampered by frequent false positive (FP) findings. Though ultimately proven benign, these suspicious findings require biopsy due to abnormal morphology and/or kinetic enhancement curves that simulate malignancy on MRI. We hypothesized that analysis of a series of FP MRI findings could reveal a pattern of association between certain \"suspicious\" lesions and benign disease that might help avoid unnecessary biopsy of such lesions in the future. METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified women undergoing breast MRI between June 1995 and March 2002 with FP findings identified by MRI alone. Lesions were retrospectively characterized according to an MRI Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System lexicon and matched to pathology. RESULTS: Twenty-two women were identified with 29 FP lesions. Morphology revealed 1 focus (3.5%), 5 masses less than 5 mm (17%), 11 masses greater than 5 mm (38%), 1 (3.5%) linear enhancement, and 11 (38%) non-mass-like enhancement. Kinetic curves were suspicious in 15 (52%). Histology demonstrated 20 (69%) variants of normal tissue and 9 (31%) benign masses. MRI lesions less than 5 mm (n = 6, 20.5%) were small, well-delineated nodules of benign breast tissue. CONCLUSION: Suspicious MRI lesions less than 5 mm often represent benign breast tissue and could potentially undergo surveillance instead of biopsy.

Results of bilateral mammography, US, and contrast-enhanced MR imaging were analyzed from 111 consecutive women with known or suspected invasive breast cancer. Results were correlated with histopathologic findings. RESULTS: Analysis included 177 malignant foci in 121 cancerous breasts, of which 89 (50%) foci were palpable. Median size of 139 invasive foci was 18 mm (range, 2-107 mm). Mammographic sensitivity decreased from 100% in fatty breasts to 45% in extremely dense breasts. Mammographic sensitivity was highest for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in 89 of 110 (81%) cases versus 10 of 29 (34%) cases of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) (P < .001) and 21 of 38 (55%) cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) (P < .01). US showed higher sensitivity than did mammography for IDC, depicting 104 of 110 (94%) cases, and for ILC, depicting 25 of 29 (86%) cases (P < .01 for each). US showed higher sensitivity for invasive cancer than DCIS (18 of 38 [47%], P < .001). MR showed higher sensitivity than did mammography for all tumor types (P < .01) and higher sensitivity than did US for DCIS (P < .001), depicting 105 of 110 (95%) cases of IDC, 28 of 29 (96%) cases of ILC, and 34 of 38 (89%) cases of DCIS. In anticipation of conservation or no surgery after mammography and clinical examination in 96 breasts, additional tumor (which altered surgical approach) was present in 30. Additional tumor was depicted in 17 of 96 (18%) breasts at US and in 29 of 96 (30%) at MR, though extent was now overestimated in 12 of 96 (12%) at US and 20 of 96 (21%) at MR imaging. After combined mammography, clinical examination, and US, MR depicted additional tumor in another 12 of 96 (12%) breasts and led to overestimation of extent in another six (6%); US showed no detection benefit after MR imaging. Bilateral cancer was present in 10 of 111 (9%) patients; contralateral tumor was depicted mammographically in six and with both US and MR in an additional three. One contralateral cancer was demonstrated only clinically. CONCLUSION: In nonfatty breasts, US and MR imaging were more sensitive than mammography for invasive cancer, but both MR imaging and US involved risk of overestimation of tumor extent. Combined mammography, clinical examination, and MR imaging were more sensitive than any other individual test or combination of tests. (c) RSNA, 2004. PMID: 15486214 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",

The NCI website states that for LCIS that it is *NOT* necessary to excise to clean margins. One of the reasons is that LCIS confers risk to the ENTIRE breast, and BOTH breasts. And it is often multifocal and sometimes bilateral. But even if it is a single spot, it confers risk to BOTH breasts. Often times LCIS is not AT the site of the imaging concern that prompts the biopsy, but adjacent to it. There is a lot they don't understand about LCIS.",

      "Content": "Sep 16, 2007 01:20PM - edited Sep 16, 2007 01:25PM by leaf Maybe this will help. How is the procedure performed? MRI examinations are usually done on an outpatient basis. You will be positioned on the moveable examination table. Straps and bolsters may be used to help you stay still and maintain the correct position during imaging. For an MRI of the breast, you will lie face down on your stomach with your breasts hanging freely into cushioned openings, which are surrounded by a breast coil, which is a signal receiver that works with the MRI unit to create the images. If a contrast material will be used in the MRI exam, a nurse or technologist will insert an intravenous (IV) line into a vein in your hand or arm. A saline solution will drip through the IV to prevent blockage of the IV line until the contrast material is injected. You will be moved into the magnet of the MRI unit and the radiologist and technologist will leave the room while the MRI examination is performed. If a contrast material is used during the examination, it will be injected into the intravenous line (IV) after an initial series of scans. Additional series of images will be taken following the injection. When the examination is completed, you may be asked to wait until the technologist checks the images in case additional images are needed. Your intravenous line will be removed. MRI exams generally include multiple runs (sequences), some of which may last several minutes. The imaging session lasts between 30 minutes and one hour and the total examination is usually completed within an hour and a half. MR spectroscopy, which provides additional information on the chemicals present in the body's cells, may also be performed during the MRI exam and will add approximately 15 minutes to the exam time. What will I experience during and after the procedure? Most MRI exams are painless. Some patients, however, find it uncomfortable to remain still during MR imaging. Others experience a sense of being closed-in (claustrophobia). Therefore, sedation can be arranged for those patients who anticipate anxiety, but fewer than one in 20 require it. It is normal for the area of your body being imaged to feel slightly warm, but if it bothers you, notify the radiologist or technologist. It is important that you remain perfectly still while the images are being recorded, which is typically only a few seconds to a few minutes at a time. You will know when images are being recorded because you will hear tapping or thumping sounds when the coils that create the magnetic field are turned on. You will be able to relax between imaging sequences. You will be alone in the exam room during the MR imaging, however, the technologist will be able to see, hear and speak with you at all times using a two-way intercom. Many MRI centers allow a friend or parent to stay in the room. You may request earplugs to reduce the noise of the MRI scanner, which produces loud thumping and humming noises during imaging. MRI scanners are air-conditioned and well-lit. Some scanners have music or a built-in television to help you pass the time. When the contrast material is injected, it is normal to feel coolness and a flushing for a minute or two. The intravenous needle may cause you some discomfort when it is inserted and once it is removed, you may experience some bruising. There is also a very small chance of irritation or infection of your skin at the site of the IV tube insertion. If you have not been sedated, no recovery period is necessary. You may resume your usual activities and normal diet immediately after the exam. A few patients experience side effects from the contrast material, including nausea and local pain. Very rarely, patients are allergic to the contrast material and experience hives and itchy eyes. It is recommended that nursing mothers not breastfeed for 36 to 48 hours after an MRI with a contrast material. www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info....",

Overall, especially for younger women such as yourself, about 80% of biopsies are benign. They often score imaging in a BIRADS system.  BIRADS 5 means highly suspicious of cancer (>=95%), BIRADS 3 is 'normal', and BIRADS 4 is 3-94% incidence of breast cancer.http://breastcancer.about.com/od/diagnosis/a/birads.htm The only way they can diagnose breast cancer is by a pathologist looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  (Inflammatory breast cancer can sometimes be an exception, but you don't have the typical symptoms for that, and inflammatory breast cancer is unusual.)",

I didn't have a breast MRI. An excision is more accurate than an MRI. They can't diagnose LCIS, DCIS, ALH, ADH, or any breast cancer by an MRI. They can only diagnose these things by taking a piece of tissue and looking at it under the microscope. There is some controversy about whether or not they should excise lobular neoplasia on core biopsy. I would certainly find it much more comforting to have a negative excision than a negative MRI. MRI can produce more false positives, but some women have had false negatives (in other words, they had breast cancer that did not show up on MRI.) It is uncommon, but can happen. As Anne said, if they do an excision, they can rule out having anything worse nearby. In this study, 8-19% of core biopsies were upstaged to DCIS or invasive. **Note that almost 3 times more of the upstaged women had an initial core biopsy of LCIS with calcifications than ALH.**www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... and in this study, only 7% were upstaged to something worse, having started with ALH or LCIS. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18348299?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum",

It happens all the time.  Looking at a mammogram is like trying to read print on a clear balloon.  If you are looking at it straight on, its usually no problem.  But if the printing is on the north, and you are looking at it from the south, it can be harder.  If you are looking at it from the south, and the printing is on the east or west, it can be even more difficult. The first part of the printing can overlap the last part of the printing. My friend has had at least 10 callbacks for mammograms.  She has never had an ultrasound, let alone a breast MRI or biopsy, or any other breast issues. She is fine. ",

There are some syndromes that can 'clump' together. For example, if your family carries a BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 deleterious gene mutation, the incidence of certain cancers is increased. A woman\u2019s lifetime risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Such a woman has an increased risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer at an early age (before menopause) and often has multiple, close family members who have been diagnosed with these diseases. Harmful BRCA1 mutations may also increase a woman\u2019s risk of developing cervical, uterine, pancreatic, and colon cancer (1, 2). Harmful BRCA2 mutations may additionally increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, gallbladder and bile duct cancer, and melanoma (3). Men with harmful BRCA1 mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer and, possibly, of pancreatic cancer, testicular cancer, and early-onset prostate cancer. However, male breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer appear to be more strongly associated with BRCA2 gene mutations (2\u20134). http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA However, just because you have had a squamous cell carcinoma does NOT mean you have a BRCA mutation. Squamous cell carcinomas are DIFFERENT FROM melanomas.  BRCA mutations run in families.  Though it is POSSIBLE for a person to have newly mutated gene, that would be EXTREMELY uncommon.  It is also possible, but astronomically unlikely, that all the air in the room you are sitting in will travel to the other side of the room and you would die because there was no air where you are sitting.   The guidelines for BRCA testing by the USPTF are here: www.uspreventiveservicestaskfo...   As this website says, only about 2% of the general population qualify under these guidelines to be tested for BRCA.   Roughly 15% of breast cancers are thought to be due to a BRCA deleterious gene. If you have a history of chest radiation treatment (such as for Hodgkin's disease which is a type of lymphoma; not chest Xrays to find out if you have a certain disease), then that radiation puts you at substantially higher risk for future breast cancer. About 70% of women who get breast cancer have no obvious risk factors besides being a woman. Its totally understandable to be worried; we all worry about the worst case scenario. But the worst case scenario probably won't happen.  If you worry about something and it doesn't happen, then you've wasted that energy.  If you worry and the worst case scenario does happen, then you've had to go through the worry TWICE.  I know that doesn't stop us from worrying.  Some people find distraction (something you love or hate to do, such as exercise, reading a book, window shopping, meditation, religion, cleaning the house, etc) helps. ",

But, even for the 'average' woman in the USA, note the fine printl: Although a woman's risk may be accurately estimated, these predictions do not allow one to say precisely which woman will develop breast cancer. In fact, some women who do not develop breast cancer have higher risk estimates than some women who do develop breast cancer. http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/about-tool.aspx Unfortunately, it does not give the magnitude of the uncertainty. In this academic opinion paper, ...The resulting calculation produced a concordance statistic, whose value could range from 0.50 (equivalent to a coin toss) to 1.0 (perfect discrimination). The concordance statistics for the Italian and Gail models were essentially the same, approximately 0.59 (with 95% confidence intervals that ranged from 0.54 to 0.63). In other words, for 59% of the randomly selected pairs of women, the risk estimated for the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer was higher than the risk estimated for the woman who was not. Unfortunately, for 41% of the pairs of women, the woman with breast cancer received a lower risk estimate than her cancer-free counterpart. Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much... http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.... (emphasis mine) If their model is this poor for the 'average' woman, just think how much they know about the risk for a person with a personal history of DCIS, LCIS, or invasive breast cancer.    I know there are the proverbial 'lies, damn lies and statistics', but these papers point out why I think the science of breast cancer is in its infancy.",

There aren't numbers because we don't know the numbers with any certainty (see my previous post about the modified Gail model)- particularly with ALH or LCIS (without a strong family history). To be valid, they need to look at populations of people _with your risk factors_ to form a model. It is _not_ valid to just add your breast cancer risk factors together.  Why?  If you look at this breast cancer risk model http://www.halls.md/index.php (which for me is currently down, and uses the modified Gail model and adds other risk factors to it) which adds together your risk factors (as does the modified Gail model).  The modified Gail model _has_ been compared to populations; this Hall's breast cancer risk model (that includes LCIS) has not.  Both models flatly say they should NOT be used to make medical decisions.  This Hall's calculator could give me a lifetime risk (without the use of tamoxifen) of 88%, which is higher than any other estimate I've seen in any paper. (The highest I've seen is about 1% per year; since most ALH/LCIS women are diagnosed in their 40s or 50s (including me), this would be about 30 or 40%.  An NCI-certified center gave my lifetime risk as 'anything between 10% and 60%, but probably closer to 10% than 60% - if you want better information you need to look at papers.'  My oncologist said 40% (without tamoxifen) and my genetics counselor 30%.  I also have ALH, so would it make sense to add my risk for classic LCIS to my risk for ALH?  Probably not. This paper, when combining ALH and ADH, found over 12 years that 143/698 'developed breast cancer', which is 20%.   In the abstract, they don't define what they mean, but I wouldn't be surprised if they include LCIS and DCIS in their definition of 'developed breast cancer'.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480577   In this paper, the ALH patients had an 'Estimated 10 year breast cancer risk of ...20.7 % with ALH', http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117858 So the 'breast cancer risk' of someone with ALH may be 'artificially' high if they count DCIS, or especially LCIS in their definition of 'having breast cancer'.  (If they diagnosed me with classic LCIS again, that wouldn't count as another diagnosis because I already have classic LCIS, but they might for you because you don't have known LCIS already.) Note that the 'average' woman in the USA has a lifetime risk of breast cancer of 12.4%  http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/dete... The longest term study I have found for LCIS (which I realize you don't have) is this one. http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/23/24/5534.long which found a minimum of  7.1% risk of breast cancer after 10 years. http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/23/24/5534.long    This 7.1% number is, of course, lower than the 20% numbers in the other papers, plus LCIS is normally considered as higher risk than ALH.  All of this also ignores the uncertainty of breast cancer prediction in an individual (see my previous post.) No one can guess for you.  No other person can decide how much anxiety breast screening has for you, how much your breasts mean to you, and how you view your alternatives.  You also need, of course, to look at the risks involved.  Breast surgery can have complications including chronic pain, infection, and cosmetic issues; antihormonals can have adverse effects such as the risk of clots and uterine cancer; watchful waiting has the risk of increased anxiety.  Its a risk vs benefit situation. After my core biopsy in 2005, I had a breast excision in 2006. I started tamoxifen in 2006 and ended in 2011 (and was on sertraline).   I had 2 more breast biopsies in 2007, both nothing worse than what I had.  I have had no other breast issues since 2007. This does not mean, of course, that you should choose tamoxifen.  The majority of classic LCIS women will never go on to get breast cancer.  The breast cancer risk for ALH is normally considered lower than for LCIS.",

(I have ALH, in addition to LCIS, and ductal hyperplasia (not atypical)). They normally recommend excision to make sure nothing worse is going on in the area. Some women, particularly with ADH, choose to have their slides reread. That's because DCIS is treated VERY DIFFERENTLY than ADH, and it can be difficult to tell ADH from DCIS. Most people think DCIS requires treatment, whereas for ADH, ALH, and LCIS, treatment is an OPTION. I personally am not a big huge fan of what the ACS says in their MRI screening paper because of the inconsistencies they have with regard to LCIS and risk factors. Maybe its because it was written by a committee. caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/c... The entire discussion of risk and models of risk FOR AN INDIVIDUAL is much more problematic than you might imagine. For example, the standard model of breast cancer risk is the Gail model. www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ which is a compilation if different risk factors. The problem is that we don't know HUGE risk factors (like factors with a risk of >100) that separate women with breast cancer from those without breast cancer. The following paper opined that BRCA MAY almost meet this criteria though, but that only accounts for about 10-20% of breast cancers. You might find this opinion paper from an academic journal interesting. jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re... . In essence, what it says that if you take a random group of women in the study, and separate them into 2 groups: the women who ended up having breast cancer and the group that did not. Then take 1 random women from each group and compare their scores for the Gail model. If your model predicted with 100% accuracy, then every woman who got breast cancer would have a higher score than every woman without breast cancer. If the model was only as good as the roll of a dice, then 50% of the time the woman with breast cancer would get a higher score, and 50% of the time the woman WITHOUT breast cancer would have a better score. In this study, the Gail model got a 59% score. This means that 59% of the time the Gail model gave a higher score to the woman with breast cancer, but 41% of the time the woman with NO BREAST CANCER got a higher score. The editorial said this was \"only slightly better than the roll of a dice.\" So as far as counting on any kind of numbers to predict your risk for breast cancer for you AS AN INDIVIDUAL, well, you just might want to think again (maybe except if you have BRCA/a really bad, bad family history.).",

Cancer is a continuum, not a discrete thing. Cells don't one day wake up and say \"Well, I've just become a cancer cell.\" Most people think that the road to breast cancer involves many steps. I won't say much as to DCIS (I don't have DCIS). DCIS should definitely be TREATED. There are many different categories of DCIS, from what I understand. LCIS is much more uncommon, (at least LCIS without anything worse.) (I have LCIS and nothing worse.) There is controversy about just about everything in LCIS - from its name (what it should be called), how it should be classified, its natural history, its risk for invasive bc or DCIS, what are the appropriate treatments, etc. My onc, and most oncs, opine that LCIS is not cancer. When I go in for a consult to a non-cancer specialist, I try to avoid the subject (or call it lobular neoplasia, an alternative category, which some pathologists think includes LCIS and ALH) so I won't be spending 10 minutes explaining how I can have LCIS and not consider it cancer because there is \"carcinoma\" in the name. (To the name of LCIS, it was named in the 1940s by a prominent pair of pathologists, who named it prior to knowing the natural history of LCIS- they thought it had a natural history like DCIS. Not that we know a whole lot about the natural history of LCIS, but we do know more now.) As my onc said, cancer is like being in a dark room. All we have is a flashlight. There are many unknowns. However, that means that you often have many choices. Do your research, and do what is best for YOU.",

They know this because it used to be routine to do bilateral mastectomies for LCIS up until about the 1990s, and this is what the mastectomy specimens showed. The NCI says of LCIS : No evidence is available that re-excision to obtain clear margins is required.www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pd... So this means they often do leave in areas of ALH and/or LCIS. This 2007 ACS paper  about SCREENING states Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), together described as lobular neoplasia, are associated with substantially increased risk of subsequent breast cancer, with lifetime risk estimates ranging from 10% to 20%.45 .... While lifetime risk of breast cancer for women diagnosed with LCIS may exceed 20%, the risk of invasive breast cancer is continuous and only moderate for risk in the 12 years following local excision.46 <I know there is controversy about that statement.> Only one MRI screening study has included a select group of women with LCIS,61 which showed a small benefit over mammography alone in detecting cancer. This benefit was not seen in patients with atypical hyperplasia. MRI use should be decided on a case-by-case basis, based on factors such as age, family history, characteristics of the biopsy sample, breast density, and patient preference.http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/content/full/57/2/75 (Emphasis mine) So there is controversy and uncertainty on the risk that LCIS and/or ALH confers on a patient (besides the regular uncertainty of well established breast cancer risk models such as the Gail model ' better than the toss of a coin, but not by much.' jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re... and there is uncertainty about the risks and benefits of MRI for ALH women.   In this study, MRI did not detect any further cancers in the atypical group. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... But there is controversy, as with most things concerning lobular neoplasia. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... I had a 2nd opinion at a major NCI center, and with LCIS and ALH, they did not recommend that I have an MRI, even as a baseline.  They said I had too much scar tissue.   So not everyone who has had a surgical excision after an ALH or LCIS diagnosis gets advised to have an MRI for screening, even a baseline MRI.  I am not really happy with this recommendation, but I have multiple other  issues. I'm not trying to advise you as to what you should do; I just wanted you to be prepared that you may not get universal support from your docs for getting an MRI under your conditions (assuming you don't have a strong family history of bc or had radiation treatments for Hodgkin's disease.) Your insurance company may have issues too with an MRI: they may want to use the ACS recommendations no matter what your docs say.  MRIs are not cheap, so you may want to check into this before you have one. Best wishes for a Boringly Benign outcome!",

Lymph nodes can be swollen because of infections of different kinds (including viruses, bacteria, etc.) But what Melissa said is totally correct: call backs are very common, especially on first mammograms.

No one gets diagnosed with breast cancer without a pathologist looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope, (except perhaps for the rare inflammatory breast cancer for which you don't have the symptoms.) There are 3 main types of breast biopsies: needle, core and surgical. Needle and core biopsies can be guided by mammograms or ultrasounds or MRI. They normally don't do surgical biopsies unless you've already had a needle or core biopsy that shows something suspicious. Breast MRIs are not perfect. Breast MRIs do not detect everything, and they often pick up things that are not breast cancer. Breast MRIs won't give you a definitive answer like a biopsy can. Some people don't know what they are afraid of, but some people do know what they are afraid of. Are you afraid of the pain, the cost, possible scaring? If its scarring, well, I've had 4 breast biopsies and 2 surgical excisions, and *for me* you can't hardly tell externally where any of these occurred (except the surgical excision I had in January 2018.) If its pain, then ask for plenty of lidocaine (the local anesthetic.) If you have a suspicious breast MRI, then they'd have to do a biopsy to rule out breast cancer anyways.",

Different people and procedures pose different risks for aspiration pneumonia.  So a person with severe brain damage  in certain places in their brain undergoing a procedure with general anesthesia might have a different risk than a young person having a local anesthetic with a stereotactic breast biopsy.   I think most anesthesiologists recommend nothing by mouth after midnight for procedures that are going to use general anesthesia.

The biggest problem I had with the mammo-guided ones-they put you face down on a table with your breasts hanging down and your head to your side - was hearing the directions of the radiologist to 'breathe' or 'don't breathe' because sometimes the machines made noises or slightly jerked, so it was hard for me to hear. If you have pain-complain. They should stop and give you more anesthetic. Get a sports bra-I found the front zip type very helpful, and wore them almost 24/7 for several days after biopsy (except showering). Tiny ice packs were also helpful for me. I know this is a very frightening time. I think everyone is frightened. But many women here think 'the best lump is the lump in the jar' - that means getting biopsied- because that's the sure fire way of telling what is going on. Good for you for getting it checked out! Sending you cyber-hugs as you go through this.",

Is Atypical lobular hyperplasia a higher risk also?....i was just told I have Focal atypical lobular hyperplasia, sclerosing adenosis and ductal calcifications. this came back after the stereo biopsy. I go to see a breast specialist next week. darn these boobs. Yes, atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) is higher risk too.  Most studies I've seen combine both ADH and ALH together in the same risk group.  Even though you see ADH and ALH described as 'high risk', IMHO, there is a BIG difference in people's definition of 'high risk'. Some particular BRCA mutations put women at an 80% lifetime chance of breast cancer.  Yes, I'd call that 'high risk'. Some papers also call ADH and ALH as 'high risk'.  This recent study (different studies differ) A total of 698 women with atypical hyperplasia were followed a mean of 12.5 years; 143 developed breast cancer..http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24480577 143/698 = ~21% over a mean of 12.5 years. (This 21% figure includes DCIS) Remember, the  lifetime overall average for breast cancer in the USA population of women is about 13%.  Most women are diagnosed in their 40s-60s. In another study  ,Estimated 10-year cancer risks were 17.3 % with ADH, 20.7 % with ALH, 23.7 % with LCIS, and 26.0 % with severe ADH   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117858 There is almost no information about the long term (>15 yr) risk of ALH or ADH.  In this study of LCIS (which generally is considered to be more at risk (not less risk) for breast cancer than ALH or ADH), was found to be at least 7% after 10 years. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=LCIS+Chu...   LCIS and DCIS are certainly considered to be closer to invasive cancer than ALH and ADH on a microscopic level. I guess this shows how little we know about probabilities. Your prescriber may give you different numbers; studies are different; women are in different situations, some women have different risk factors such as family history or history of chest radiation treatment (such as for lymphoma).",

If you have an extensive family history of breast/ovarian cancer, you may want to be evaluated for that. I know you don't want to go through this anxiety every year. But there are downsides to having bilateral mastectomies, besides the obvious. Some people do really fine after surgery, but some definitely do not. So it ranges from A-OK (except of course without breasts, at least initially, and drastically reduced sensation) to continual infection, continual ongoing pain, difficult reconstruction (f you want reconstruction), etc. I have classic LCIS (which is thought to confer a higher risk than any of your listed conditions), and my breast surgeon refused to do PBMs. Normally they reserve PBMs to persons who have an extensive family history. You may have problems finding a) a surgeon who would do this and b) get insurance coverage to do this, even if your heart is set on this. Many LCIS women on this website have had PBMs. Of course, you can ask your doctor whether there is anything you can do about your condition. I would be VERY surprised if (s)he recommends PBMs unless you have an extensive family history. But everyone's circumstances are different. There's no harm in asking your doc if there is anything you can do.",

I'm sure different studies differ, but this study showed The aim of this study was to make a thorough inventory of the histologic features of epithelium and stroma within and adjacent to breast fibroadenomas in 396 cases. Breast fibroadenomas seemed to display a wide spectrum of proliferative and nonproliferative histologic changes. Hyperplasia (excluding mild hyperplasia) within the fibroadenoma was found in 32.3% of cases. Carcinoma in situ (CIS; 5 ductal, 3 lobular) was found in 8 fibroadenomas (2.0%) removed from 6 patients, the youngest of whom was 40 years of age. In 3 cases CIS was not confined to the fibroadenoma, but also involved the adjacent parenchyma. No invasive carcinoma was present within this series. Complex histologic features were seen in 40.4% of cases, mostly in relatively older patients (mean age, 35.4 years). Hyperplasia in adjacent tissue was found in 8.8% of cases, usually in older patients (mean age, 45.5 years). Known risk-elevating lesions in and around breast fibroadenomas occur frequently and mostly in patients older than 35 years. These findings may have consequences for the clinical management of a subgroup of patients with fibroadenoma. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11345838 I assume you don't have something very unusual going on, such as a history of radiation TREATMENT (such as for Hodgkin's disease) in the chest, or Cowden's syndrome which has an estimated incidence of 1:200,000 but is probably somewhat higher emedicine.medscape.com/article... or taking cyclosporin (usually used for organ transplants) . This is what the ACS says about fibroadenomas: \"Fibroadenomas can be diagnosed by fine needle aspiration or core needle biopsy. Most fibroadenomas are simple fibroadenomas. They look the same all over (uniform) when seen under a microscope. They do not increase breast cancer risk. But some fibroadenomas contain other components (macrocysts, sclerosing adenosis, calcifications, or apocrine changes). Women with these complex fibroadenomas have a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (about 1½ to 2 times the risk of women with no breast changes).  <snip> Sometimes (especially in middle-aged or elderly women) these tumors stop growing or even shrink on their own, without any treatment. In this case, as long as the doctors are certain the masses are really fibroadenomas and not breast cancer, they may be left in place and watched to be sure they don't grow. This approach is useful for women with many fibroadenomas that are not growing. In such cases, removing them all might mean removing a lot of nearby normal breast tissue, causing scarring that would change the shape and texture of the breast. This could also make future physical exams and mammograms harder to interpret. It is important for women who have fibroadenomas that have not been removed to have breast exams regularly to make sure the mass is not growing. Sometimes one or more new fibroadenomas grow after one is removed. This means that another fibroadenoma has formed -- it does not mean that the old one has come back.\"http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/content/CRI_2_6X_Non_Cancerous_Breast_Conditions_59.asp  Even *IF* you have some of these higher risk lesions, when they say 'increases your breast cancer risk 1.5-2 times', they are NOT NOT NOT saying that risk is 13% x 1.5 or 2 = up to 25%.  The breast cancer risk of a woman with 1.5-2 times average risk is the risk of a woman WITHOUT any particular breast cancer risk factors, which is about  3-5%.  So the lifetime risk of a woman with a lifetime risk of 1.5-2 times is about up to 10%.  The average woman in the USA has a lifetime breast cancer risk of about 12-13%. Of course, you should and are getting your new symptom checked out. Anxiety is awful, isn't it?  Some people find distraction helps.  Some people get a prescription for anti-anxiety meds from their GP. Let us know how it goes, OK?",

I'm sure it would have been worse if they ripped out my arm, so I'm not calling it a 10.  I'm sure part of the problem was because I was informed strictly to 'not move a muscle during the procedure', and I knew if I told them it hurt I would cry and if I cried I would move.  He saw my face, and injected lidocaine, but that hurt as much as the wire insertion, and didn't ease any pain.  This went on for another hour or so (held in a mammo machine.) I was traumatized.  A few months later I was diagnosed with a PTSD-like syndrome.  (I had previous traumas growing up, but I'm sure this breast experience didn't help.) My next biopsy was stereotactic mammo-guided again. I actually pulled out of the mammo when he tried to inject my breast with lidocaine in a tiny TB syringe.  I did that instinctively because last time I had been traumatized. He asked himself what to do.  They had to hold me into the machine as I silently cried. With my next biopsy (ultrasound) I warned the doc I wanted LOTS of lidocaine, and it wasn't painless, but it was better. I wrote 2 letters.  I did a survey here on needle insertion.  Some women  (about half) have a pain score <=5/10. Others do not. As bcincolorado says, some people do pass out.  One poster here had such a bad time with a breast biopsy/needle insertion that she didn't go for a mammo again for 10 years, because she was so afraid of the pain that would be involved if she needed another biopsy. (As you probably know, they commonly have a 6 month followup when you have a benign outcome, and even with the most lenient schedules, she would have a followup mammo much before 10 years.)  When she did go get another mammo in 10 years, she had invasive bc.   Everyone is an individual.  Everyone brings their own past experience with into the biopsy room.  As my recovery room RN friend said, \"There should be no painful procedures.\"  I'm sorry this happened to you.

(See what they have in the 'teething baby' section. Its probably benzocaine.)  Benzocaine, or any of the -caines itself shouldn't cause any problems with clouding  the Xrays. Make sure whatever you use does not contain with talc (magnesium), calcium, aluminum, or iron. These metals probably are not put into baby teething medication. It may be messy (bring wipes or towels) and your bra will get medication on it. Wipe it all off before you have your mammogram. Its easier if you wear a 2 piece outfit (like pants or skirt with top.  They let you wear your skirt or pants while getting the mammogram.)   And let the technician know you have breast pain.  If they have any sense, they will treat you as gently as possible. They can use mammograms to help diagnose BENIGN breast diseases, as well as breast cancer. If this was a routine,normal mammogram, it might take a month or so to get your results.  The technician will not be able to give you your results.  At my place, only the clinician (the doctor that ordered the mammogram) could give you your results.  I'm high risk, so often I can get a verbal from the radiologist (him/herself) or (radiologist via the technician) if everything looks OK.  So if you're lucky, you may get a reading on the spot, but sometimes you will have to wait and get the information from your clinician.  It may depend on the radiologist's workload that day.

This study found an association, but it may be just chance. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20...  This1997 paper opined the association has long been a matter of debate. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/92... This study speculated a possible hypothetical mechanism. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18... Since they don't even know if the association is real, the association, if real, is quite weak. Breast cancer prediction models for individual patients are in their infancy.   When you look at breast cancer risk models, the most popular (for women withOUT a personal history of breast cancer, DCIS, or LCIS) is the Gail model. www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ However, you must look at the caveats about that model.  The Gail model specifically says it should NOT be used for medical decisions.(All other models I have seen, with the possible exception of BRCA  models - are just as rotten as the Gail model for prediction of breast cancer for an individual woman.) For example, this medical journal opines that, even for the 'average' women, the Gail model, and other models that include significant risk factors are, for any individual woman, \"better than the toss of a coin, but not by much\".  jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/re... That's because when they compared any randomly selected woman WITH breast cancer, and compared her score to any randomly selected woman WITHOUT breast cancer, roughly 55-60% of the time, the woman WITH breast cancer got a higher score than the woman WITHOUT breast cancer.  However, this means that about 40-45% of the time, the woman WITHOUT breast cancer got a higher score than the randomly selected woman WITH breast cancer.  This is even when they threw in known, established risk factors such as breast density. So, yes, there may be an association between thyroid disorders and breast cancer. I have both a thyroid disorder and LCIS, which is usually considered a risk factor for breast cancer. I certainly wouldn't worry that your thyroid disease means you are destined you will get breast cancer.  There are many risk factors for breast cancer that are a lot stronger than thyroid disease (in populations), yet they still are not powerful enough to separate out individual women who will get breast cancer from those that won't.",

In researching this, I gather that these two items are just markers that help the pathologist identify that the cells are breast cells, and, perhaps what type they may be.  Sometimes when they see cancerous cells, it can be hard to tell what type of cells they really are.  Cancer cells are named from their organ of origin.  So when breast cancer cells travel, say, to lymph nodes, they still stay breast cancer cells, not lymph node cancer cells.  If you have colon cancer and it travels to the brain, the cells in the brain are still colon cancer cells, not breast cancer cells.  Cytokeratins are a type of protein found in some cells. They are found in epithelial cells.  Epithelial cells are the cells that line the cavities and surfaces of many organs. Skin cells are epithelial cells. Epithelial cells rest on a basement membrane. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithelial_tissue It sounds like cytokeratins are now called keratins. They provide structure to the inside of some cells.  These cytokeratins tend not to change when a cell becomes cancerous.   So they help the pathologist decide what type of cell may be cancerous. Apparently, in one report, cytokeratin 5/6 (which apparently is the same as cytokeratin CK5/6) can distinguish between usual ductal hyperplasia (UDH, which is NOT atypical) from atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)/ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).  The latter 3 conditions (ADH, DCIS, and LCIS) puts one at increased risk of invasive breast cancer, while UDH does NOT put one at higher risk (or by any significant amount.)  ADH, DCIS, and LCIS in this study showed no or low staining with anti-CK 5/6. www.springerlink.com/content/0...  Nothing is absolute though - these stains just help make it more probable the cell is one certain type and not another. I'm not a pathologist or cell biologist, so I'm not sure exactly what all they are testing for or against, but it certainly just seems to be a confirmation that they are breast cells and not another type, or a confirmation of the diagnosis, as CandDsMomsaid.  It will be good to ask your mom's onc when she sees him next. Please know we are thinking of you and your Mom.  ",

I do know that many doctors are wrong about predicting how much time a person has left. I do know that many women with stage IV breast cancer can live many productive years. I am trying to help a friend who has a cancer with a very grim prognosis (Its not breast cancer or ovarian cancer.) Less than 5% of patients live 1 year after diagnosis. There was one website that I think was helpful in dealing with my friend. cancerguide.org/median_not_msg... She knows it will take a miracle for her to survive. She doesn't want to talk about her emotions, but I am hoping eventually to get her to the place where she feels safe enough to accept my care and concern about her. When she was first diagnosed I was going to make her tell me how 'angry, or afraid, or whatever' she was feeling. I didn't know it was OK for people to be in denial. I think most people want people to listen to them. For me, I think its been helpful for my friend to let her know that her treatment decisions are HER choice, because it is HER life. Even if I disagree with the course she is taking - because I am not in her shoes. If she asks for information or help, I try to give her that. There are forums below for metastatic disease, for African Americans with breast cancer, and another for caregivers, below. You may be interested in checking them out. I'm sure others with more experience, support, and information than I will be along shortly. You and your mother are in my thoughts.",

I know everyone is different, and you know your mum better than anybody here. But I will share what has worked better for me. But it probably won't work for anyone. I have a friend that was diagnosed with a very serious cancer ( its not breast cancer or ovarian cancer) Feb 1. She knows what the statistics are - it will, indeed, 'take a miracle' for her to survive this. At first, she was wavering back and forth if she wanted to be treated at all. Some studies showed even if rads and chemo for this cancer don't help with survival, they may help with quality of life. She's having lots of pain, etc. She has simply refused to discuss how she is feeling. At first she shut up even more. But I have spent hours with her, just listening non-judgmentally to her, whatever she wants to talk about. Sometimes she's silent. Sometimes she has been pretty critical of me, like saying I wear watches that are too big, or that I'm going to grow mushrooms under my hats (I often walk around with wet hair.) But now I'm just glad when she can express anger at me or anyone. I have not had a pain score of above 5 continuously for over 2.5 months, nor am I in her shoes dealing with an almost certainly terminal illness. Very gradually, she's gotten closer to telling me about how she feels. I brought up the 'Be Positive....(shuuut up!) thread in the Just Diagnosed forum. She agreed said she just ignores those people. But that's closer to expressing how she feels than what I've gotten before. I know she has issues about 'feeling trapped'. I'm hoping at some time in the future, that she will feel safe enough to talk more about her feelings, so at least at some point, I'm hoping she will be able to listen to me telling her how much her friendship has meant to me. We might never get there. And maybe its bad for me to try to make her go in that direction. Now maybe pushing works for some people, and 'not pushing' works for others. And probably something entirely different works for still others. But maybe its something to think about.",

At the hospital I work out, before they figured out what was going on, several nurses reported to the emergency room.

I can find very little information about the phrase 'fibrotic infiltration'. But I thought that fibrosis, with no other diagnoses, was a benign condition. Fibrosis can happen in many tissues in the body. It can be a reaction of the body against something. I do not know if fibrocystic conditions are the similar to fibrotic infiltration, but I would suspect they are similar. I would guess that fibrotic infiltration would just mean there is a lot of fibrosis going on. While we don't know what causes fibrocystic conditions in the breast, they are very common, and is definitely not cancer. The most common signs of fibrocystic breasts include lumpiness, tenderness, cysts (packets of fluid), areas of thickening, fibrosis (scar-like connective tissue), and breast pain. www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/... Here is a website that describes many conditions of the breast, but does not include 'fibrotic infiltration'. http://www.pathologyoutlines.com/breast.html If that doctor has made you frightened you have cancer without explaining anything to you, then I think (s)he has failed with communication. From what I understand, it is good to get nipple changes checked out, as it sounds like you were doing. But the doc needs to explain to you what he means. From what I understand, fibrosis does *not* mean cancer. If you haven't done this already, you may want to consider seeing a breast specialist.",

At that time (2006) I did a survey about mammogram-guided wire insertion here.  This is what I found. 38 people responded to my survey.  People were able to choose only of the 4 following responses. 1) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)   19 people, 50% 2) I had injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  7 people, 18% 3) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was tolerable (<=4/10 on a scale of 1-10)  3 people , 8% 4) I did NOT have injectable anesthesia before wire insertion and my pain was NOT tolerable (>4/10 on a scale of 1-10.) 9 people, 24%. So we are all different and come to this with a different personality and history.   At my place, IV anesthesia during the wire insertion was out of the realm of possibility because an RN was not in attendence.  The injectable anesthesia (which I got after the first wire insertion) was an injection of a local anesthetic (lidocaine) into the breast. We all have our own, unique experience, which is valid for each of us. Of course, we all hope you have a painless proceedure, and as good an outcome as possible.",

Basically, these are the general recommendations by the US Preventative Task force for genetic screening.  It does depend on your actual family tree: for example if there are no females in one or more generations, then there may be no info about some patterns of inheritance:  Both maternal and paternal family  histories are important. For non\u2013Ashkenazi Jewish women,  these patterns include 2 first-degree relatives with breast  cancer, 1 of whom received the diagnosis at age 50 years or  younger; a combination of 3 or more first- or second-  degree relatives with breast cancer regardless of age at di-  agnosis; a combination of both breast and ovarian cancer  among first- and second- degree relatives; a first-degree rel-  ative with bilateral breast cancer; a combination of 2 or  more first- or second-degree relatives with ovarian cancer  regardless of age at diagnosis; a first- or second-degree rel-  ative with both breast and ovarian cancer at any age; and a  history of breast cancer in a male relative.    For women of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, an in-  creased-risk family history includes any first-degree relative  (or 2 second-degree relatives on the same side of the fam-  ily) with breast or ovarian cancer.  http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf05/brcagen/brcagenrs.pdf   (A first degree relative would be a daughter, mother, or sister.  A second degree relative would include a grandmother or aunt.)  ",

If needles upset you, make sure you tell your doc beforehand. You won't have to look, I'm sure. If you are having apprehension about pain, then I think its best to have a conversation with the radiologist before the procedure starts. Ask him or her what you should do if you have pain, so you know what to do, and (s)he will be alert for that. On some procedures (like stereotactic core biopsies), they don't want you to move. So, for one procedure (this is NOT a fine needle or core biopsy), I wish I would have set up some nonverbal signal to show if I was in pain, even if it was ringing a bell or something. One woman here posted that she thought all biopsies should come with an offer of a sedative. I agree with her. My core biopsies took like 1-2 hours, but a lot of that time was in setting up the mammo machine (I had stereotactic core biopsies). For my core biopsies, you had to be still maybe 30 min to 1 hr. They injected so much lidocaine, I didn't even *feel* the post-procedure mammograms. My ultrasound biopsy was much shorter. It took maybe 15 minutes. A lot of the time involved is in the set up, and afterwards, they want to make sure any possible bleeding has stopped. In all cases, I went to work about 8 hours later. (I work the graveyard shift.) Please know we are thinking of you, and wishing you a normal, healthy outcome. If you have a core biopsy, then I think that a tight fitting bra (like a zip front sports bra) is ideal.",

If a biopsy is positive, they may have to go in again.  It depends on what they find, and what is in the cut edges of the sample they remove. For example, if they found invasive bc or DCIS, and they found invasive or DCIS at the cut edges (called 'at the margins'), then they normally want to go back in and get clean margins.  However, some women, especially those with more extensive invasive disease, get chemotherapy before surgery.  So their surgery can be many months after their biopsy. The chemotherapy can shrink the tumor, and they can preserve more of the breast. If you have LCIS or atypia and nothing worse (an unusual case, to be sure) after excisional/lumpectomy biopsy, they normally don't go in again.  That's because the purpose of the excision (in the case of LCIS and nothing worse) is to make sure there isn't something worse in the area, not to remove the LCIS/atypia.  The reason for this is that you can have multiple lesions of these in one's breast, and they usually can't detect where it is except by looking at a sample in the microscope. They would not know what areas of the breast to remove.  Also, it doesn't matter much because, at least in the case of LCIS and ALH, those conditions put BOTH breasts, even the normal-appearing tissues, at increased risk. If they get clean margins, then they normally don't have to go in again.",

I am NOT NOT a statistics guru, there are a lot of statistics I do NOT understand.  One of these papers describes OR (odds ratio) and I do NOT have an intuitive feel for what that means.",

But many breast lumps, particularly in younger women, are benign. As far a lumps being either cancerous or non-cancerous, well, that can be a little of a gray area. In general, yes, lumps are usually categorized as either cancerous or non-cancerous.  However, cancer is NOT a 'line in the sand'.  Cancer is 'uncontrolled cell growth'.  In the middle of the spectrum, it can be difficult to categorize tissues as cancerous or non-cancerous.  That's one reason why they like to characterize a cancer's 'personality'.  I have an unusual condition that has 'carcinoma' in its name, but most oncologists do not consider it a cancer.  (Lobular carcinoma in situ - don't expect that as its unusual.) For older women, they often like to remove lumps, whether or not benign, because they can mask things underneath it. They cannot diagnose you without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.   Without knowing your symptoms, age, and background, I would really hesitate at labeling you 'sunk'.  If you have an ulcerous lesion that is growing on the surface of your breast, bulging lumps in your armpit that stick out from the surface, then it is likely you have advanced cancer. If you had chest Xray treatment for things like Hodgkin's disease, then that puts you at higher risk. They can, and often do, 'score' mammograms and imaging.  If you have a BIRADS score of 5 (probably (>95% chance cancerous), you have a higher chance of having breast cancer than if you have a BIRADS score of 4 (about 5-95% chance of being cancerous.)  Even so,we have had people with a BIRADS score of 5 come back with benign results.  Even if it is news you don't want to hear,  breast cancer is not an automatic death sentence. You mother had breast cancer at a relatively early age (I assume pre-menopausal.)  That does put you at higher risk.  But it is not inevitable. On the other hand, if you are young (< say 50 years old), and have no symptoms, then it is less likely.  Overall, for the entire population, 80% of breast biopsies in the US turn out to be benign.  This groups together the people who have more suspicious signs and less suspicious signs, but it gives you some idea.",

Most of us who stick around here have breast cancer, or are at increased risk for breast cancer, so we're not the most unbiased group. It can take forever to get through the diagnosis stage. Pregnancy and lactation can make it more difficult to follow what is going on with breast lumps - to tell normal things that are going on with the breast during pregancy and lactation versus something else going on. Most lumps, not all lumps, but most bc lumps have been in the breast some 6-10 years before they can be detected by any means. Most of us are not physicians, so we can't give medical advice. If you are concerned, which it sounds like you are (I would be too because I'm a Nervous Nelly) , then I'd push for a biopsy before IVF.

Wipe it off before you get into the mammography room.  You shouldn't use any antiperspirants or deodarants or powders before the Xray because they can cause artifacts that can look like calcium deposits. You first get into absolutely lovely hospital gowns.  (They let you wear the garments on your lower body. )   You usually sit in a room with other women dressed the same way, looking nervously at each other.  Sometimes a nice comraderie develops. They have you stand in a certain position, support your arms against grips on the machine.  The techinian puts your breast onto a plate, tells you not to move, steps away to take the picture.  You are normally not compressed for more than 10-30 seconds. I heard there was one study where the patients were allowed to control the amount of compression they had during mammograms.  (The flatter your breast, the better the picture.)  The patients selected a pressure that was not significantly different than what the technician would have chosen. The technician is not allowed to give you any results - preliminary or otherwise.",

They gave me 1 spray of ethyl chloride (which is about the equivalent of 3 seconds of the application of an ice cube), then did the insertion. Unfortunately, beforehand, they told me I was not to move a muscle under any circumstances. I knew if they had to do it over again, they would be mashing up the tissue even more. I tried to be brave, but I'm sure my pain score was at least 9/10. (I have a history of trauma, so that's probably why I reacted so badly.) Most people handle this fairly well (I did a survey here, and most people probably had a pain score of around 5/10), but I did not, nor did another friend of a friend who had the same procedure. This was 10 years ago, so maybe things have changed. I was told that they couldn't give me opiods because they didn't have an RN present. (This was done by the radiology staff, so there was a radiology tech present, who of course does not have an RN.) I wrote 2 letters complete with Pubmed references, and got a reply from the radiologist 'then I'd have to add some sodium bicarbonate to the mix'. I have no understanding how adding sodium bicarbonate would have helped with my pain relief. (I'm a pharmacist.) This paper says sodium bicarbonate doesn't even work. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11... They never even asked me if I was in pain - and I'm sure the procedure lasted for at least 30-90 minutes. Agreeing with what aunt paula already said, here's a website about people with different local anesthetic allergies. If you are in the 'worst case scenario' and cannot handle any amide or ester-type anesthetics, they can use opiods, diphenhydramine, or general anesthetics. www.uic.edu/pharmacy/centers/d... I'm sure they'd have to go through extra insurance company loops to get an OK for an anesthesiologist (MD or RN) to get involved to use a general anesthetic, because that would be more costly. But, I don't care if I was 1 in 1 million people. No one should have a pain score of 9/10 during a procedure, even if its 'all in their head' or whatever.",

There is little that is cut and dry in breast cancer, including with conditions that put you at higher risk such as with ALH.   Almost all findings/opinions concerning ALH (and LCIS) are controversial. 'Extensive' may have an ambiguous meaning here.  Extensive may mean 'extensively throughout the field of the microscope - in other words, the TINY (microscopic) sample that the pathologist looked at has ALH all over it', or extensive, as in each sample that was looked at had ALH.   Even so, this may depend on the size of tissue they LOOKED at (not took) during your excision.  LN (lobular neoplasia) is often multifocal (in other words you have multiple spots of it) and bilateral (both breasts-although this is less common.)  They know this because about 20 years ago, they routinely did bilateral mastectomies on LCIS patients. Over 50% of patients diagnosed with LN contain multiple foci in the ipsilateral breast and about 30% of cases will have further LCIS in the contralateral breast [12-14]. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC314428/ Since LN is usually an incidental finding, it is not possible to know exactly how much ALH you have without a mastectomy. A higher risk of progression is attributed to LIN 3 (pleomorphic LN, extensive LN, and signet ring cell LN) compared to LIN 1 or LIN 2 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16... but this is just one paper's opinion. Since you have no family history of BC (and I assume of ovarian cancer), then I would assume you would be at low risk for a BRCA mutation.  It is usually thought that BRCA puts one at higher risk of breast cancer  (about 60-90% lifetime risk) than any of the atypias (including ALH and LCIS). I have LCIS and ALH (and sclerosing adenoma) and a weak family history, and I have read papers that describe LCIS (which is more advanced than ALH) as moderate risk. caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/c... This Stanford site describes ALH risk as 'moderate'",

Studies suggest that the amount of RF energy produced by cellular telephones is too low to produce significant tissue heating or an increase in body temperature. However, more research is needed to determine what effects, if any, low-level non-ionizing RF energy has on the body and whether it poses a health danger (2)<snip> How is a cellular telephone user exposed to RF energy? A cellular telephone's main source of RF energy is produced through its antenna. The antenna of a hand-held cellular telephone is in the handset, which is typically held against the side of the head when the telephone is in use. The closer the antenna is to the head, the greater a person's expected exposure to RF energy. The amount of RF energy absorbed by a person decreases significantly with increasing distance between the antenna and the user. The intensity of RF energy emitted by a cellular telephone depends on the level of the signal sent to or from the nearest base station (1). [To me, this implies that RF is not produced, or at least produced at a much lower level, when the cell phone is off.  However, this is a guess.  I am not a RF expert.] <snip>?What parts of the body may be affected during cellular telephone use?There is concern that RF energy produced by cellular phones may affect the brain and nervous system tissue in the head because hand-held cellular telephones are usually held close to the head. Researchers have focused on whether RF energy can cause malignant (cancerous) brain tumors such as gliomas (cancers of the brain that begin in glial cells, which surround and support the nerve cells), as well as benign (noncancerous) tumors, such as acoustic neuromas (tumors that arise in the cells of the nerve that supplies the ear) and meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, which are the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord) (1). The salivary glands also may be exposed to RF energy from cellular telephones held close to the head.Ihttp://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/cellphones",

(Other anesthesiologists may use different medications.) They can sedate you to one of two endpoints: so that you're completely unconscious, or until you have conscious sedation.  When I had my excision, I had conscious sedation.  I didn't have any pain, but sometimes I could feel some patting sensation on my breast (presumably the surgeon blotting away extra blood.)   I could not open my eyes or see a thing until it was all over and they were transferring me to another table.  Everytime I tried to speak (even just trying to say Ummmmm - I wasn't feeling any pain at all; I was only expressing surprise at being in this state of consciousness) - I got another slug of anesthetic.  I didn't have any masks (that I was aware of) for my excision.  I could not say anything more meaningful than 'ummmm' or 'uhhhh.' Usually IV medication is usually included in the mix, even if they use masks and gases in addition. When they've used masks on me (for other operations), often the masks had a very 'plasticy' smell.  But I wasn't conscious long, and when I woke up I was not wearing a mask. Different anesthesiologists do things differently.  Some people have had a choice whether they want to be totally unconscious or whether they want conscious sedation.  It also probably depends on how large or long the surgery will be, and what other medical conditions you have.  ",

There are a very few women here who have had a negative mammogram, ultrasound, and negative MRI, but still ended up having breast cancer.   This is quite, quite unusual, but it CAN happen. Conversely, there are women who have had a worrisome mammogram, ultrasound, AND worrisome MRI,but a biopsy turned out negative for anything worrisome. There is little that is 100%in breast cancer.",

I have only had 3 breast biopsies, and I had 'zinging' pains after each one, which would occur without any immediate causes (such as poking).  It sounds like you may have had some nerve damage?  The pain for all my biopsies and breast excision gradually went away.  In the case of my breast excision it took many months for them to *totally* go away.  I am probably somewhat of an unusual case, because I have a history of unrelated trauma, and I had an awful wire insertion before my breast excision, which probably made the next breast biopsy much worse than my first.  (Our bodies learn from our experience.)

There is almost nothing in breast cancer that is 100%.  If we could diagnose breast cancer from symptoms only, then they wouldn't need to do imaging or biopsy.   For almost all breast cancer, they can't diagnose you until someone looks at a piece of tissue under the microscope.   Since it sounds like you are very worried (as would be natural), then you may want to push to see the breast surgeon.  If your lump is big enough, and perhaps in the right location (?) then they may be able to do a fine needle biopsy right in the office.  (I've never had a fine needle biopsy.) ",

Some women get a lot of cysts.  If all of these lumps are solid,  I think some women here have had something like 8 - 14 biopsies, and only 1 of them turned out to be cancer. Ultrasound is good at detecting if a lump is sold or if it is fluid-filled (a cyst.)  Cysts are almost always benign. I haven't had any lumps, but I'm sure its physically possible to biopsy lumps in both breasts at the same time.  I had 2 'areas of concern' in the same breast, one seen by mammo and one by ultrasound, and they did the biopsies a week apart. I'm sure they would have done them together if they had been able to detect them with the same imaging. Most breast cancer is *not* genetically linked to a single mutation.  About 70% of women with breast cancer have no obvious risk factors for getting breast cancer (besides being a woman.)   Age is a big risk factor for breast cancer. (You are considered young for breast cancer.  The median age to get breast cancer is 64, per Dr. Love's Breast Book.) *Some* 'red flags' for having a genetic breast cancer (BRCA1 or BRCA2)  from a single gene would be things like having several first degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter)  with breast cancer or ovarian cancer, or several second degree relatives (aunt, grandmother) with breast or ovarian cancer, or male breast cancer. There are other genetic mutations in other genes, but they are much more uncommon.  I went to genetic counseling, and though I have more than the average amount of cancer in my family, I was at low risk for having a BRCA or any other breast cancer-related mutation.  The most common symptom of breast cancer is a painless lump.  But some women do have painful lumps.  Most often, these are benign.  Remember, overall, 80% of biopsies are benign. That's a big number. In the 'worst case scenario', if you have breast cancer, most breast cancer has been in the body for 6-10 years before it can be detected by *ANY* means.  So a delay of several months usually won't make a difference.  It is good you are getting them checked out.  Many women here feel that 'the best lump is the lump in the jar' - in other words, feel best in getting things biopsied (at least if they aren't cysts.)  Cysts can feel hard if they are deep. If your lumps shrink and swell with your menstrual period - well, cancer doesn't shrink like that - cancer is 'uncontrolled growth'.  Feel free to ask questions or vent. We are here for you!",

Cysts can also be painful, and draining them relieves the pressure. No change in the lump sign is probably a bit on the side of good, but it doesn't give you much information.  Its good that it isn't growing at a rate you can detect.",

Some people who have a bad family history choose not to get tested for BRCA,and some who are BRCA positive choose not to have bilateral mastectomies.   Usually if a person has a bad family history of breast/ovarian cancer, they prefer to first test a person who has had the breast cancer - and it may be the first person in the family who got breast cancer (if that is possible - if they are still alive - for some families they have documented breast cancer going back for many, many generations.) Some people with a horrible family history get negative BRCA results.  The purpose of the first genetic counseling meeting is to inform you of the possible consequences of genetic testing, and what they may mean to you emotionally.  They usually indicate that genetic testing may want to be done if it would change treatment decisions. The genetics counselor should not be pressuring you for or against genetic testing.  They usually  recommend to start screening daughters when they are about 10 years younger than their mother got breast cancer. ",

There probably aren't enough trained radiologists to handle all the diagnostic process to have it go faster. But that doesn't make it less stressful. It would be very helpful if they gave the patient some info to put their results into context. That is one of the very nice things about this BB. This website has a lot of information. It is common to have your mind run wild while you are getting things checked out. We all want to be ready for whatever is on the path ahead of us. I'm sure it is common for people to imagine the worst case scenario. I said to myself, \"What is the worst case scenario? That I not live to make it to the tumor board? (The tumor board is the hospital committee that processes that handle cancer diagnoses.) Some women have pictured their funeral in detail. I didn't get the big picture. Overall, for all age groups, 80% of biopsies are benign. They haven't even talked about biopsies for you yet. I will tell you how worried I was. I ended up having a biopsy. I got the call about diagnosis on a Friday night at 6pm (so I'm sure the radiologist stayed late to tell me), and he said \"You have LCIS. Do you know what that means?\" I replied, \"Yippeee! \" I was so happy I didn't have invasive breast cancer. (LCIS (lobular cancer in situ), in spite of the name, just puts you at higher risk for breast cancer. Its quite unusual.) Now, I wouldn't wish this on anyone, but I am grateful I didn't have invasive cancer. After that, even **IF** you have breast cancer, breast cancer is NOT an automatic death sentence. About 65% of those who get breast cancer die of some OTHER condition. My grandmother had breast cancer in the 1950s, before the age of chemos, or probably rads. I think all they had was mastectomies. She lived for another 23 years and died of an unrelated cause. At that time, breast cancer was an unspoken word (because most women died of it), and I was told to never talk to her about it.

Elevated levels are also found in a variety of cancers.  They have investigated MANY 'biomarkers' for endometrial cancer over the last decade (at least).  I have had several endometrial biopsies, and to my knowledge they have not done any of  these biomarker tests on them. I would doubt that your gyn requested this test for a 'routine' endometrial test, unless you are in an endometrial cancer trial or study of some sort.  It sounds like SAA is being tested in endometrial cancer in a RESEARCH setting, and has not reached routine clinical use. In addition, because they wrote:  Final Diagnosis: SAA, even IF you did have high SAA levels, that is NOT a diagnosis- that is a laboratory test.  They didn't even write diagnosis: Elevated SAA. So I highly suspect it means: Same as above. Please let us know what you find out.",

When I had my first appt with the breast surgeon, it took another 3 weeks to get an appointment for an excision. There are 3 main ways they biopsy. 1) Fine needle biopsy. This can be done in the office. It is the least invasive, but it can distort the cells in the sample, making it harder to read. 2) Core biopsy. I think these are usually done by radiologists. They use a slightly larger needle. They use local anesthesia. I've had 3 of these. 3) Excisional biopsy. This is when they remove the 'area of suspicion', and is a surgical procedure, done by a surgeon. This is the most invasive, but the 'gold standard' way of looking what is going on. I have had one of these. Waiting is definitely the hardest. We all want to be prepared for what is ahead. Remember, even for the most high risk woman, 80% of biopsies are BENIGN in the United States.

Swelling is a common sign of infection, as could be changes in the shape of the breast.  If she has a breast infection, the breast lymph often drains into the armpit/underarm.  The lymph nodes act as a 'trap' for infections. They will probably do a breast exam on your mom, and likely order a mammogram.  Mammograms can be used to diagnose other things besides breast cancer.  There is little in breast cancer that is 100%, but the most common first sign of breast cancer is a painless lump, or a mammogram abnormality.  But some women can have other symptoms. It is good to get this checked out.  But do not diagnose her with breast cancer before her doctor does.  She does not have breast cancer until she is diagnosed with it. It is a very frightening time, so your mom is lucky she has such a concerned and resourceful daughter like you! Many women like to have a person who will listen well to them at a time like this.  And many women feel distraction helps. ",

I think a model of breast cancer is that in the usual case, it takes about 6-10 years for a breast cancer to reach the size it can be detected by *any* means. So usually breast cancers have been in the breast for some time. Some people think that some/often times if it metastasizes, it does this at about year 2, still long before it is a size big enough to be detected. When things happen in the time frame like your mother, I think the usual thought is that the cancers that are in her liver, etc. were there before she had chemo. There is a forum below about recurant breast cancer, where there are a lot of women in similar circumstances. Please know I am thinking of you. You must be going through a horrible time.

Diagnosis does take a long time. I've seen some posters here who said it was >6months.  (They sent slides to another institution, and didn't tell the patient.) Before I was diagnosed, I thought the only women who got breast cancer were women who ignored  their lumps.  See what I knew! This site has been sooo helpful. The importance of confidentiality.  (I work at the hospital where I got diagnosed.) I learned NOT (for ME) to tell my colleagues about my potential health problems. (I was crying periodically at work, and I wanted them to know it Wasn't anything they had done.)  It ended up some very inappropriate things happened, such as  (essentially) a male stranger (who was not a doctor, but knew someone with my diagnosis) tell me he recommended bilateral mastectomies, and people recommending how I should have handled my feelings.  That was not helpful. While it is inevitable that some people will say dumb things, I was also probably much more vulnerable around the time of diagnosis and getting a treatment plan in place. That when I tell someone else about my diagnosis, their first gut reaction will likely be something self protective, that involves the feeling \"That's awful and won't happen to me.\" I learned that saying, \"I'm sorry this happened to you\" is generally more helpful than 'You will be OK', or 'Be positive'. I found out about how often mothers with young children are struck with  breast cancer.  That the women who chose tough treatments are not doing this to 'maime' themselves, but to save their lives.",

They can also use the words 'high risk' for people with atypical hyperplasia or LCIS or DCIS with a weak family history.  The science of breast cancer prediction in these women with atypical hyperplasia, LCIS, or DCIS is in its infancy, but some places put the risk of  some of these women as low as 10%.  (I, with  classic LCIS and a weak family history, was told I have a risk somewhere between 10% and 60% but probably closer to 10% than 60%.)

So, its not good to generalize.  There are 'Renaissance doctors' who know multiple areas well.  I read of one surgeon (who did ?trauma surgery) who also did a residency in psychiatry. Some people do have knowledge outside of their specialty.  Once, a hospital pharmacist, after looking at  some imaging of a patient, very very gently led the doctor to a diagnosis of endocarditis (infection of the heart valves).  Pharmacists are normally NOT trained in imaging.  She made the doc  feel like he made the diagnosis, but it was really the pharmacist that caught the missed diagnosis. (Legally, pharmacists cannot diagnose.) However, one nutty relative said 'First I got lung cancer, then breast cancer, then terminal brain cancer diagnosed by a dermatologist', had never had an MRI, seen an oncologist, neurologist, or neurosurgeon.

They are simply describing in very concrete terms what the ultrasound looks like.

No one can diagnose breast cancer from an image (Mammo, MRI, ultrasound.) Remember, Birads 4 is suspicious, but not characteristic of breast cancer.

(I think they usually look like a tiny cookie cutter vs a needle biopsy where they use a needle.) In IBC usually lymphatics in the dermis (that's a skin layer) are involved (but not always).  I guess you can bump this up to a more 'expert expert' (breast surgeon). For another rare medical condition (not bc) I was first referred to the local specialist.  I knew he was umm, shall I say, wasn't well versed in the disease (he said to come back when I had more symptoms) and I ended up going to the nearest Major Institution, to a person who specialized in this medical condition. If you are not happy with the way you have been handled,  you really need to get someone 'on your team' in which you have confidence.  Major Institutions can have excellent people, and some not so excellent people.  (I was not happy with my breast consult at this Major Institution, but I'm very happy with my care for this other rare medical condition - different physician and department.)  You need to have confidence in 'your team'!!",

Ultrasounds do *not* 'trump' mammograms, and mammos do not 'trump' ultrasounds. They all give more information. No breast imaging is 100% accurate or sensitive. This means that there is no breast imaging technique that can detect all breast cancers, and/or exclude all benign lesions. They saw a density on mammogram, and didn't see it on ultrasound. That's all your ultrasound report means. This is not uncommon. They are proceeding to investigate this further with MRI. Lesions often show up in one imaging and not in another. When multiple imaging (for example mammo + ultrasound + MRI) all are taken, then it improves the sensitivity. They aren't saying that your density under mammogram didn't happen, or changing their minds that the density *under mammogram* wasn't seen. Hang in there. Feel free to ask questions or vent.",

This means that at 6 o'clock, you have a solid mass, and next to this you have a cyst. At 2 o'clock, you have an area that shows up 'light' (hypoechoic means in the ultrasound, the ultrasound waves don't bounce back as well as in ordinary tissue) echoes in 2 places, and you also have a cyst. Cysts are almost always benign. Masses may or may not be. Hypoechoic does not mean that you have definite cancer. Smooth margins in a mass suggest benign, but this is not an absolute rule. Unfortunately there are few rules in breast cancer. The only way they can definitely diagnose cancer (or benign-ness) is with a biopsy. Did they recommend biopsy? People are different, but you need to have your doctors keep testing until you are comfortable that this is benign. They may also be able to drain the cysts if they can locate them (I do not have any personal experience with cysts.) Remember, 80% of biopsies in the US are benign. This figure holds even in women with a horrible family history of breast cancer. So statistics are in your favor, even if they did recommend a biopsy.",

One thing you might ask is what is the BIRADS score of your imaging.  Most women have calcifications.  Even most suspicious calcifications end up being benign.  Overall, about 80% of breast biopsies end up being benign.

Ultrasounds can usually see if something is a cyst- a fluid filled sac.  These are almost always benign.  They can feel hard if they are deep. Many people choose to have cysts aspirated, not because they are dangerous, but because in the future they can hide the tissue beneath, and cysts can sometimes cause pain. If they aren't a cyst, then many women here feel 'the best lump is the lump in the jar'.  (This means to err on the side of biopsy.) Remember, overall, 80% of biopsies are benign.

I am a postmenopausal woman with both LCIS and ALH, and a weak family history. In order to make decisions for ourselves, we really want to know 'What is MY risk for breast cancer?' Since my risk for breast cancer may be different than any other group I am thrown in with (e.g. women with LCIS, women with ALH, women who started their menstrual period at age X, women who didn't breastfeed, etc.) Since I can only make decisions about myself, my aim is to estimate risk for ME, not risk for a group I may belong to. I can point you to this article. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.... It points out the vast difference between estimating breast cancer risk in a large group of women, and the risk of an individual woman. It looked at the Gail model, which is probably the most used breast cancer risk model, at least for women without a significant family history of breast/ovarian cancer. The Gail model automatically excludes anyone with LCIS. It found the accuracy of the Gail model, with or without additional risk factors such as breast density, etc, was very poor FOR INDIVIDUAL WOMEN. It separated the population into two groups: a) the women who ended up getting breast cancer, and b) those that ended up not getting breast cancer. They selected one random woman from each group, forming a pair. It looked at the risk of each pair of women. 'In other words, for 59% of the randomly selected pairs of women, the risk estimated for the woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer was higher than the risk estimated for the woman who was not. Unfortunately, for 41% of the pairs of women, the woman with breast cancer received a lower risk estimate than her cancer-free counterpart. Thus, for any given woman, the two models were better at prediction than a coin toss\u2014but not by much.' (emphasis mine). So if they have this much trouble calculating the risk of an average woman in the USA, just think of how many problems they have for calculating the risk of an individual woman with ALH, which a member of a much smaller group of women with ALH, versus the risk of an individual average woman in the USA, a member of a much larger group. My clinicians tossed my lifetime breast cancer risk numbers at me. (I got various figures such as 30%, 40%, and from one clinician, 'somewhere between 10% and 60%, but probably closer to 10% than 60%. If you want a better answer, go to the journals.') Those numbers may or may not be true. But to estimate MY risk, they may throw out numbers, but, I imagine even in the best case scenario, those numbers will be correct for you a MAXIMUM of 60% of the time; since we know so much less about ALH than the average woman, I imagine those numbers will be correct for you closer to 50% of the time, which is pure chance (i.e. the model does not predict any better than by chance.) This last paragraph is pure speculation on my part, again I am not a statistician, but I can't imagine they know numbers for ALH with or without LCIS, even as a group very well. ",

If they don't want to do a fine needle biopsy or MRI, then there are also core needle biopsies, which use a needle of a larger diameter.  But I'd much, much rather face a biopsy with a negative mammogram and negative ultrasound than a biopsy with a positive mammogram and/or positive ultrasound.  That means your chances of it being benign are much larger.

There is less information about atypia at a younger age. In one recent paper, it looked at MRI screening for women with LCIS and atypical hyperplasia. In a 6 year study, of 125 women with atypia (ADH or ALH) and 252 with LCIS, 3 of the atypia patients and 11 of the LCIS patients got DCIS or worse. If you just stick these numbers in a calculator, this ends up being about 0.4% per year for atypia, and about 0.7% per year for LCIS. (Port et all, Ann Surg Oncol 14(3) 1051-1057 (2007) www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... The age of the women in this study was 25-74. The youngest woman with atypia who got 'anything worse' was 56, and the youngest woman with LCIS who got 'anything worse' was 39. If you take these numbers and multiply them by your lifespan, if you expect to live until age 80, then (obviously making a whole lot of assumptions), (80-24) x 0.4 = about a 22% lifetime risk for breast cancer, which is about 1 in 5. (This is making lots of assumptions.) You can also stick your numbers into the Gail model. www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ But do be aware how much uncertainty there is about the Gail model. The Gail model pretty accurately predicts how many women in a population will get breast cancer. But it is really lousy at predicting which INDIVIDUAL women will get breast cancer - to make clinical decisions about any particular patient. If you look in hindsight and compare the Gail model scores of individual women who ended up having breast cancer, and individual women who ended up NOT having breast cancer, their Gail model scores were usually only slightly different- the breast cancer woman had a higher score less than 60% of the time. So it isn't good at predicting if YOU will get breast cancer. ***** Then the question of getting BRCA testing. It will depend on your family history, and what your family tree looks like. If you have fewer people in your family tree, and fewer women, then it may be valuable to get your family tree evaluated by a board certified genetics counselor. Here are some recommendations about genetic testing, from a different thread in this forum. This study says that families with a truncated family tree need to incorporate this uncertainty in the decision. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... These are the guidelines for BRCA testing by the US Preventative Task Force. www.guideline.gov/summary/summ...",

The only thing the nurse practitioner could see was my nipples seemed to be pointing in different directions.  I got a sonogram.  LCIS puts you at higher risk for ILC (sometimes known as the sneaky one).  Eventually, I had a biopsy, which showed scar tissue. If you have not had surgery, its pretty unlikely you have scar tissue.  I had scar tissue inches from my excision - my surgeon must have gone all over my breast. She later said that when she went in for my excision, she would have been looking at any 'pulling' in the tissue. Wrongdiagnosis.com lists 7 potential causes of breast dimpling. www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptom...  (and I'm sure there could be others). I know we all want to be ready for whatever is ahead for us, so we tend to think about the worst case scenario.   I can't tell you what the doctor will recommend, of course.  No imaging is 100% accurate or sensitive; as you probably know, they have to look at a piece of tissue before you get diagnosed with breast cancer.  I'm not certain what you've had done, but if your mammo is negative, they might order an ultrasound (sonogram).   If that is negative, they may order an MRI or biopsy.   Biopsies can be expensive, but can give you the most accurate picture (if they get the right area.)  Pursue this until YOU are satisfied with your answers.",

I think usually when they write reports like this, they say exactly what they see.  For example, in plain English, they might say of a mammo that there are white spots here and a shadow there.  They can't say whether or not it is cancerous or benign, because they don't have that information. The only way they can for sure diagnose breast cancer is by looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. Dr. Susan Love, in her book, describes  breast imaging like this: Its like seeing your friend Mary from the back.  You know that its probably Mary because she is about the same height as Mary, has the same hair color as Mary, is wearing the kind of clothes that Mary usually wears, but you won't really know that its Mary until she turns around and you can see her face. If you see a person that is a foot taller than Mary, then you know its almost certainly not Mary. We can't biopsy everyone because we simply don't have the resources. You won't know for sure what a diagnosis is unless you look at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  Going through all this diagnostic stuff is awful.  We're here for you. ",

This is a direct quote from the NCI website.  They didn't even quote the website THEY were citing correctly. \"According to estimates of lifetime risk, about 13.2 percent (132 out of 1,000 individuals) of women in the general population will develop breast cancer, compared with estimates of 36 to 85 percent (360-850 out of 1,000) of women with an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. \" http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA They should have said UP TO 85%.   Some of the people with BRCA have a 36% lifetime risk of breast cancer.  That's different than 85%. The article you cited said that BRCA women had \"And in women younger than age 40 without the BRCA mutations, but with a very strong family history, the risk is about 15 times higher than the general population, according to the Canadian researchers.\" but we ALREADY know that BRCA women have breast cancer at an earlier age, and the risk of breast cancer in the normal population before the age of 40 is quite low- the AVERAGE age to get breast cancer is in one's early 60s.   You have to beVERY CAREFUL with statistics.  When somebody says they have 15 times the general population- well, you know that CAN'T be right because the NCI says the risk for an average woman is 13%, and 13x15 is MORE THAN 100%, which of course isn't possible.  When they say 15 times, the researcher probably means 13 times 3-5% which might be 45-65%. I can't remember  what your family history is like, but if you have a significant family history, I would really encourage you to talk to a board certified genetics counselor.

When I saw an oncologist, he said my lifetime risk was about 30-40%. That's about what my genetics counselor said (~ 10 years ago.) I was told I have a BRCA risk about the same as an average Ashkenazi Jewish woman. My family history is somewhat better than yours: Postmenopausal (after the age of 50): paternal grandmother, several maternal aunts; post genetic counseling I have also had 1 postmenopausal cousin and one premenopausal cousin diagnosed with dc. I found one paper that described LCIS as 'high risk' and in another part of the same paper 'medium risk'. They still have not decided whether or not LCIS women should get MRI screening, even though of course 30% and 40% are more than 20%. (LCIS is an unusual condition.) I have not had any further breast diagnoses worse than classic LCIS. If the GC determines your risk of a BRCA mutation is relatively low, then do know that the science of breast cancer risk prediction is in its infancy. See this paper for comparing how well the modified Gail model did, which is not very good for individuals. The modified Gail model does really well for seeing how many women in a GROUP will get bc, but it does LOUSY for predicting whether ONE PARTICULAR woman (for example, you) will get bc. http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/98/23/1673.... . (Lousy is my adjective - the modified Gail model is right about 60% of the time and wrong about 40% of the time for the general population. Notice that the toss of an honest coin would be 50% heads and 50% tails.) In the paper they say perhaps an exception may be for women with a single inherited mutation, such as BRCA.  ",

I had hematomas, so my breast turned all sorts of beautiful autumnal colors (black,purple, green, yellow) which faded over time.  I wore 'breast supports' (thin wire breast plates that looked like I was in a Wagnerian opera) for about a week.  I resumed jogging about 1 week later.  Jogbras were very helpful to me. Jiggling hurt. Tiny ice packs were better for me than pain meds.   I found the wire insertion (mammo-guided wire insertion) very difficult, but l have a history of trauma and anxiety issues.  I did a survey here, and more than 1/2 of the people found the wire insertion tolerable (pain score <=4/10).  Since everyone has a different history, personality, and anatomy, I would only advise that *****IF****** you have pain, complain.  I did not, and I'm sure that would have improved my situation immensely.  During the wire insertion, I was told 'I was not to move a muscle during the procedure', and it lasted ?1.5 hours.  At my place, they did not allow IV anesthesia during the procedure since they don't have an RN present. You are right: they are mainly doing the lumpectomy to make sure there isn't 'something worse' going on in the area. I didn't have an MRI before my lumpectomy, but it was almost 6 years ago.  I think it is much more common for women to have an MRI before lumpectomy so they can plan their surgery better if there are things that light up on MRI.  MRIs are not cheap, so if you do decide to ask for one, you may want to inquire if your insurance would pay for them.  Some women pay some $3-7K out of pocket for them when their insurance does not cover, and I want you to at least be prepared if that's the route you want to go.",

At my first biopsy, for suspicious calcifications, I was laughing at the techs and doctors, because I thought it was silly they were suspecting that _I_ had breast cancer.  I thought that the only women who got breast cancer were women who ignore their breast lumps.  Needless to say, that's not true.   I won't give you any advice because most who post here are who were in the unlucky 20% who did get breast cancer at their biopsy.   So, for them, it was important to get biopsied.    Another way of looking at your choice is: if your doctors are giving you the option of whether to biopsy or not, then there's no strict right answer, and whatever you do (whether its an 'informed decision' or not) will be the right choice for you.",

It said Dentist cancer mortality and incidence generally showed a favourable risk pattern for lung cancer and overall cancer occurrence. Nevertheless, several studies reported an increased risk for certain cancers, such as those of the skin and, to a lesser extent, the brain and female breast. These elevated risks may be related to social status or education level, or may alternatively represent the impact of hazards in the workplace. The evidence for an increased mortality or cancer incidence risk among dentists must be interpreted in light of methodological limitations of published studies. Future studies of dentists would benefit from the assessment of specific occupational exposures rather than relying on job title alone. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17... This about occupational exposures: Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18...",

There are plusses and minuses to ANYthing. For needle biopsy: Some of the minuses: a) There will be a charge for this procedure and for the pathologist to prepare and read it. b) There is a VERY SMALL chance it may cause some sort of scarring internally. I think the chances are VERY SMALL, but possible. c) It may not be totally painless, but most women don't feel it is too bad. d) It is possible to miss the lump, or not get a good sample. e) You will have to wait a few days for the results. f) There is a very small risk of infection. Some of the positives: a) You will have a much better chance to know exactly what you are dealing with. You won't have to wait in agony for 3 or 6 or 9 months wondering what this is. Biopsy is much more reliable than breast imaging. There are MANY fewer risks to ultrasound. Minuses: a) It will take about 1 hour of your time, and may cost a few hundred dollars. b) It is not 100% accurate - it is simply ' more info'. Plusses: a) I found it very comfortable-at my place they use warm ultrasound gel, and the slowly press a wand across your breast. b) It is good at detecting fluid-filled things, like cysts, which are usually benign. I have had an ultrasound-guided core biopsy, and a mammogram-guided core biopsy. I bled after my 2nd mammo-guided core biopsy, but it wasn't distressing. They gave me plenty of local anesthetic. My breast looked black and blue after the 2nd one, but it went away after several weeks. It returned to its normal color in a few weeks/months. It is YOUR choice what you want to do. Because your mom has breast cancer, and because it is a lump, I would vear towards getting it ultrasounded and/or biopsied. But I'm a Nervous Nellie, and am at higher risk. It is YOUR choice. If you definitely do NOT want to have these procedures, you don't have to have them. But I'd have to have a REALLY GOOD reason for not doing these.",

The chances of fcc turning into cancer are probably larger than a meteorite landing on your head, but the increased incidence of breast cancer is women with fcc is small- its hard to measure. There is a lot we don't understand about the development of breast cancer.  There is a lot we don't understand about who will get breast cancer. There is a lot we don't know about the statistics of breast cancer. Since about 60% of women have fibrocystic breasts, and in the USA roughly 13% of the general population will get breast cancer sometime in their lives,  many women with fibrocystic breasts will be part of this 13%.  But many people who *don't* have fcc on a biopsy will get breast cancer, and, of course, many women get breast cancer who have never had a breast biopsy so we don't know what is in their breast. If you have atypical cells in a breast biopsy, this is an adjective that will put you at a measurable increase in breast cancer risk. Even *if* you have atypical cells, then numbers get thrown around that your lifetime risk of breast cancer is about 15-20%, which is an increase from the average 13% of the normal population.   Even if a surgeon recommends a biopsy (which hasn't happened yet), overall about 80% of biopsies are benign.  That's a pretty large number.  So the chances of this being breast cancer are quite small.  If you are postmenopausal and have a new lump, then you might have a somewhat higher chance of having breast cancer than if you are premenopausal.  But still, the chances are very large this is nothing to be concerned about. The only connection that I know of between cervical dysplasia and breast cancer is that both can be influenced by hormones, specifically estrogen.  But, of course, all women have some estrogen running around in their bodies.  Having certain viruses (such as HPV) are a risk factor to have cervical cancer, but since women's estrogen levels vary all over the place, and cervical cancer grows very, very slowly, this is very difficult to measure. So, to sum up, from what you have said, *if* you have any increased risk of breast cancer, its probably so small its not measurable. ",

It is usually just found on biopsy. My risk for breast cancer has been estimated at everything between 10% and (with a breast cancer calculator that has NOT been compared to populations) 85%.  But probably a good ballpark figure would be a lifetime risk about 30% or around 0.5-1%/year. Most women with BRCA are estimated to have a lifetime risk between 40-90%.   Most figures I've seen for atypical hyperplasia are roughly half that of LCIS, maybe 15-25%? Its not known if a bad family history increases that risk, as far as I know. Some risk factors are additive, and some are not.  This means, for example, if your risk from factor A was 10% and your risk from factor B was 20%, your overall risk might be 30%, or 20%, or 10%, or some other number.  If your risk factors were additive, they'd be 30%, but that is NOT always the case. The 'average' woman in the US has a lifetime chance of getting breast cancer of about 10-12%.  Risk factor calculators, such as that published by the NCI , are good for calculating the risk in a POPULATION, but are 'only slightly better than the roll of a dice' for calculating *YOUR* risk as an individual. http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/ http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/98/23/1673.pdf Its because we really don't know the characteristics that clearly separate women who have had breast cancer from those that have not.   About 70% of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer have *no* obvious risk factors for getting breast  cancer, other than being a woman. ",

Pain is a really complicated subject. I think a lot is unknown about breast pain.   http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/breast-pain/DS00760/DSECTION=causes If they surgically remove the fibroadenoma, then your surgery will probably not be as extensive as those who undergo breast cancer surgery (certainly they won't look for any lymph nodes), but, for example in this paper of chronic pain after breast *cancer* surgery, a significant number of patients had chronic pain (presumably from surgery and/or breast cancer treatment). www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...  Your chances of breast pain after breast surgery are almost certainly not this high since fibroadenoma removal would not involve any further treatments or lymph node removal.  I don't quickly see if they provided information about how many women had breast pain *before* their breast surgery. Other options for fibroadenoma removal include cryoablation (freezing the adenoma) ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12433600 and vacuum assisted biopsy.www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19...  I can't dig up much information about breast pain after these procedures other  than what the abstract says.  There also may not be anyone in your area doing these procedures. I didn't know this before my breast surgery, but breast scarring does not only include how your breast looks on the outside.  Internal breast scarring makes it harder to see(mammograms, etc)  what is going on (for routine breast cancer surveillance) in the future. So there are *many* factors involved in whether or not to have surgery.  You will make the right decision for you after consultation with your doctor.",

If you look at the breast like the doctor would be looking at yours, with your nipple at the center of a clock, then 12 o'clock would be straight up from your nipple, towards your face.  This is not describing how deep (how far between your skin surface and your chest wall.) Your surgeon should discuss things with you.  (Some surgeons are better at this than others...) You don't talk about lumps, so I assume it may be calcifications.   There are 3 main types of biopsies: a) fine needle biopsy: they take a fine needle and sample the 'area of concern'. b) core biopsy: they take a larger needle, and take samples about the diameter of a cooked spaghetti noodle.  c) excisional biopsy: they usually only do this if there is a big lump to be removed, or you already have some cancer diagnosed. Cosmetically, it will also depend on how big your breast is, and how much they remove.  I have a B cup, and I've had 3 core biopsies and  1 excisional biopsy.  I had a slight dent from my excisional (had about 6 cores the size of a spaghetti noodle removed), but it filled in over time.  I went back to work 24 hours after having my excisional biopsy.  For my core biopsies, I had them done in the late morning, and went to work on the graveyard shift that night. Unless your lesion is on the chest wall, they won't be touching any chest muscles.   If I were you, I'd like to see my lesion on the ultrasound. Remember, overall 80% of biopsies turn out benign.  The mean age to get breast cancer is 64. Its good that you are getting it checked out! ",

They do NOT know if this is cancer. The only sure way they have of diagnosing breast cancer is by looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. I have not read your previous posts, so hopefully they will be contacting you whether they think you should be biopsied, or have an MRI.  The Birads scoring system  (at least for mammos) is Birads3: probably benign (<2% cancer) Birads 4: suspicious abnormality: not characteristic of breast cancer, but a reasonable probability of being malignant. Birads 5: lesion that has a high probability of being malignant (95%).  Remember, even if you get to the biopsy stage, 80% of biopsies are benign.  That's a big number.

So the track was excised. (It ended up that it didn't matter because all they found was LCIS, and they don't need to excise to margins with LCIS, as its usually multifocal and often bilateral. But if I had real bc, then it could have made a difference.) Yes, cancer cells can be found in the washings after core biopsy (see paper below). So, yes, cancer cells can regularly get into the track. ***HOWEVER***** , normally if they find cancer, the track is removed by excision, lumpectomy, mastectomy, and/or radiation. Also, those displaced cancer cells normally do not survive. As Bessie said, the incidence of seeding is quite rare. They have done studies where in tissue culture they took breast cancers and took them to another site and they did not grow. So breast cancer growth is quite dependent on the individual surroundings. I have seen some papers that opined that most invasive breast cancers are thought to micrometastasize at about 2 years, long before they are normally detected. But since obviously not all invasive breast cancers have found to metastasize, often the body is able to kill these cancer cells. There are plusses and minuses to each procedure. Excision can give you an easier time to read the tissue, but excision is usually more invasive, and may affect their ability to do SNB (if you are a candidate for that.) I was also told I am not a candidate for MRI because I have too much scar tissue from excision. They probably don't have the resources to do everyone's lesions by excision, too.

Here are some I found. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/ent... 1: Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2007 Aug 3 [Epub ahead of print] Links Risk of needle tract seeding of breast cancer: cytological results derived from core wash material. Uematsu T, Kasami M. Breast Imaging Section, Shizuoka Cancer Center Hospital, Nagaizumi, Shizuoka, 411-8777, Japan, t.uematsu@scchr.jp. Needle track seeding has been recognized as a possible, albeit rare, complication of breast core needle biopsy. The purpose of this study was to assess the risk of needle tract seeding of breast cancer from cytological results derived from core needle wash material. The study included biopsies of 207 breast cancers performed using ultrasonographically guided 18-gauge core needles. Each core needle without exposed sample notch was washed in saline solution immediately after removing the needles. Cytology derived from core wash material was performed by saline solution lavage of the fragments using a cytocentrifuge. The cytological diagnoses were divided into five categories: benign, atypical/indeterminate, suspicious/probably malignant, malignant and unsatisfactory. Atypical/indeterminate, suspicious/probably malignant and malignant categories were considered to represent positive cases of needle track seeding of breast cancer, whereas benign and unsatisfactory categories were counted as negative cases. Cytological diagnoses of the 207 lesions were as follows: 26 lesions (12%) were benign, 18 lesions (9%) were atypical/indeterminate, 37 lesions (18%) were suspicious/probably malignant, 79 lesions (38%) were malignant, and 47 lesions (23%) were unsatisfactory. The incidence of positive cases of cytology derived from core wash material was 65% (134/207). The 25% frequency of positive cases of invasive lobular carcinoma was significantly lower than the frequencies of DCIS (74%) and invasive ductal carcinoma (69%) (P = 0.001 and P < 0.01). The frequency of positive cases in the multiple passes group was 75%, which was slightly, although not significantly, higher than the 66% frequency in the single pass group (P = 0.3). In conclusion, the incidence of positive cases of cytology derived from ultrasonographically guided breast core needles' wash material was 65%. The clinical significance is debatable; however, there may be a theoretical risk of local recurrence if the tract is not excised or radiotherapy not given.

Knight R, Horiuchi K, Parker SH, Ratzer ER, Fenoglio ME. Saint Joseph Hospital, Denver, Colorado, USA. OBJECTIVE: Image-guided core needle biopsy (IGCNB) is an accepted technique for sampling nonpalpable mammographically detected suspicious breast lesions. However, the concern for needle-track seeding in malignant lesions remains. An alternative to IGCNB is needle-localization breast biopsy (NLBB). No study has been done to compare the local recurrence rate of breast cancer after IGCNB versus NLBB. METHODS: We have retrospectively reviewed the local recurrence of breast cancer in patients diagnosed by either IGCNB or NLBB who underwent breast-preserving treatment for their cancer between May 1990 and June 1995. The length of follow-up averaged 29.7 months. RESULTS: Three hundred ninety-eight patients were diagnosed with breast cancer by IGCNB (297 patients) or NLBB (101 patients). All patients underwent breast-conserving surgery. Fifteen (3.77%) patients had a local recurrence: 11(3.70%) in the IGCNB group and 4 (3.96%) in the NLBB group. These recurrence rates are not statistically different. CONCLUSION: Concerns for seeding of the needle track with cancer cells have made some surgeons wary of IGCNB. However, we did not find an increased rate of recurrence due to needle-track seeding, and IGCNB remains our procedure of choice for diagnosing mammographically detected suspicious breast lesions.

Department of Surgery, General Hospital, University Vienna, Waehringer Guertd 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria. florian.fitzal@meduniwien.ac OBJECTIVE: Several case reports and clinical studies in the literature demonstrate needle track seeding after core needle biopsy in patients with breast cancer in up to 50% of cases. The impact of this observation on local recurrence and overall survival rate is, however, not fully investigated. PATIENTS AND DESIGN: We retrospectively analysed 719 patients after breast conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy for stage I and II breast cancer. We divided this group into patients with (189) and without (530) preoperative core needle biopsy. Demographic data, local recurrence and overall survival rate were compared between these two groups. RESULT: Preoperative core needle biopsy did not significantly influence the local free recurrence rate (median follow-up time of 78 and 71 months, respectively). The prognostic factors and the postoperative therapy did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Preoperative core needle biopsy seems to have no detrimental impact on local recurrence and overall survival after breast conserving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.

Chao C, Torosian MH, Boraas MC, Sigurdson ER, Hoffman JP, Eisenberg BL, Fowble B. Departments of Surgery and Radiation Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA. Early mammographic detection of nonpalpable breast lesions has led to the increasing use of stereotactic core biopsies for tissue diagnosis. Tumor seeding the needle tract is a theorectical concern; the incidence and clinical significance of this potential complication are unknown. We report three cases of subcutaneous breast cancer recurrence at the stereotactic biopsy site after definitive treatment of the primary breast tumor. Two cases were clinically evident and relevant; the third was detected in the preclinical, microscopic state. All three patients underwent multiple passes during stereotactic large-core biopsies (14 gauge needle) followed by modified radical mastectomy. Two patients developed a subcutaneous recurrence at the site of the previous biopsy 12 and 17 months later; one had excision of the skin and dermis at the time of mastectomy revealing tumor cells locally. In summary, clinically relevant recurrence from tumor cells seeding the needle tract is reported in two patients after definitive surgical therapy (without adjuvant radiation therapy). Often, the biopsy site is outside the boundaries of surgical resection. Since the core needle biopsy exit site represents a potential area of malignant seeding and subsequent tumor recurrence, we recommend excising the stereotactic core biopsy tract at the time of definitive surgical resection of the primary tumor. PMID: 11328321 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] If there is a risk of seeding, it is quite rare, as Bessie said. Many women who have breast cancer are diagnosed by needle biopsy. You don't have all of these women being diagnosed with mets. If you are concerned, and do end up with a diagnosis of cancer, then urge the surgeon to excise the track, and/or consider radiation. etc.",

The usual treatments for DCIS are (lumpectomy + radiation) or mastectomy. Depending on the characteristics of the DCIS, they may do other things. (There are several kinds.) The usual treatments for invasive cancer depend on the size, and 'personality' (characteristics) of the cancer,  personal risks and preferences, and whether or not it has spread outside the breast. Treatments include chemotherapy, radiation, lumpectomy or mastectomy, and, for some cancers, anti-hormonal treatment or other anti-cancer treatments.  (I'm sure I've missed some things.)  It all depends on the 'personality' of the cancer. She can't get diagnosed without looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.  The doctor may make some good guesses, but we have had women here who have been told they were sure they had cancer and the biopsy came back benign.   Breast cancer is not an automatic death sentence.  The majority of women who get breast cancer now live long lives and die of some cause other than breast cancer. Most women like to have someone they can talk to - someone who will listen and not judge.  She is probably quite frightened right now - that is very understandable.  It is only natural to be worried if someone suspects she has a serious disease. Most of the women who get breast cancer have no obvious risk factors for getting breast cancer - besides being a woman.  The outlook is so much better than it was when my grandmother had breast cancer in the 1950s. She had bilateral radical mastectomies, and as far as I know, nothing else.   When I was growing up, we were told we were never to say the word 'breast cancer' to her. That was because so many women died of breast cancer.  She lived for another 23 years, and died of an unrelated cause.  Things are light years better than that now.  There is also the  (probably) substantial chance that your mother does NOT have breast cancer or breast pre-cancer.",

This is an NCI certified center too.   I guess they thought this might 'reassure' me. Maybe they didn't know I've read all (at the time) some 200+ Pubmed abstracts (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/ent... that come up when you put in 'LCIS'. They also seem to have misplaced this 2nd opinion - I have requested copies of it at least 5 times, including going there in person.  In addition they said I should not have a screening MRI, even a baseline one, because I have too much scar tissue. There is another point, however.  Multiple risk factors do NOT HAVE to be additive.  In fact, for some risk factors, it looks like they are NOT (such as some risk combinations that involve alcohol consumption).  This means if factor A is 10% and factor B is 15%, your total risk may be 25%,but it may be 10%, 15% or 5% or 30%. What they have to do is look at the population of people with BOTH risk factor A and B, and find out their risk.  (This is called comparing the model to the population.)  It is hard to say what to look for in Lobular cancer.  It is commonly known as 'the sneaky one'.  It is often found when it is larger than IDC.  However, it is often slower growing, and, maybe it may be less agressive???  (I have NOT looked at all the Pubmed abstracts for ILC.) ILC is almost always E-cadherin negative.  E-cadherin is thought to be associated with cell adhesion.  ILC often forms sheets (thickenings), rather than the lumps found more often in IDC.  That's why it often is harder to detect.  Some women have nipple retraction, or their nipple changes direction.  Or their breast changes symmetry slightly.  A few months after my excision, I saw a shadow in my breast when I was in the bathroom with the light above the mirror that was a new phenomenon.  Eventually, it was biopsied and found to be scar tissue.

I had the excision on my larger breast, and its still my larger breast.  It turned all autumnal colors (purple, blue, green, yellow), and parts were hard- but after about 6-9 months it all turned to normal. If I did it over again, I'd start massaging the area to break up scar tissue starting a month or so after surgery. I went back to work (mostly computer work, but some light lifting-I'm a pharmacist) 24 hours after getting out of the recovery room.  (I had twilight anesthesia.) I used a couple of pain pills, but mostly to get me to sleep (from insomnia due to anxiety, not pain.)   I found a jogbra and *tiny* ice packs very helpful-more helpful than pain meds. Maybe my excision was too small to count?  I'm pretty sure my surgeon didn't know how much she'd be taking out before she went in, but you are probably in a different situation.  Doesn't hurt to ask the surgeon. ",

Only about 10% of breast cancers are associated with single gene mutations, such as BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. Some women find distraction helps. Others find helping others, or meditation, or biofeedback, or religious exercises help. I found I could only do things that I hated, I couldn't permit myself to do something I enjoyed. I'm not undergoing a stressful biopsy right now, but I started biofeedback last December 2007 and I think it does help with my anxiety, amazingly. I didn't think anything would be helpful. But we are all different, and our needs and what works for each of us is different. Its not perfect, but its more effective than Benadryl for sleep for me, usually. In biofeedback, often the first thing you learn is to breathe into your abdomen, not into your chest or shoulders. You breathe deeply and slowly, like up to a count of 3 or more, and exhale more slowly than you inhale, like up to a count of 4 or more. (This I think stimulates the baroreceptors near your diaphram, which reduce the amount of stress hormones you produce.) Then you just barely tense different areas of your body (to see what tension feels like), and let go of the tension, working your way through the body. Envisioning relaxing scenes, and/or peaceful music or nature sounds also helps me. I know this is a very difficult time. When I was going through diagnosis, it would be useless for someone to tell me to relax-I just couldn't. I was bound and determined to worry until I was done worrying. But I don't know - maybe I could handle it differently sometimes now. Thinking of you.",

Cancer is not a 'line in the sand'.  There are cells that are clearly normal, and cells that are clearly cancer.  But classification can get 'mushy' in the 'pre-cancerous' group.   If you ask people on the street, probably most people think of cancer as being invasive, and able to kill you.  By definition, DCIS is contained within the ducts, and cannot kill you.  From what I understand, particularly for some more aggressive DCIS, it can be hard to say if some speck of DCIS might have invaded in some section of the microscope slide.  But DCIS is still considered stage 0.  If there is indication it has invaded, then its not stage 0. Hope this helps.   I know we all want to be ready for whatever is ahead for us, and that's why you want to know.  Its hard not to go to the 'worst case scenario'.  But worry and anxiety won't change the outcome, and we want you to be safe both mentally and physically.",

My impression is that ?rarely some solid lumps can have benign portions and cancerous portions.  Almost all cysts (which are fluid-filled sacs, which can feel as hard as a solid lump) are benign.  Normally, ultrasounds are good at telling the difference between a solid lump and a fluid filled sac.",

My breast surgeon has refused to do BPMs for me.(I have a weak family history.)  Treatment recommendations differ from place to place.  It is controversial.

It can be very hard to look at things positively. Goodness knows, I looked at the whole diagnostic process negatively. I'm still working on those kind of issues with my other medical problem (besides LCIS.) I'm convinced my mind works at what is handy. Minds are distractable. Some people find distraction, positive or negative helps. I know this sounds absolutely crazy, but you don't HAVE to look at things positively. You can look at things negatively. It may be tougher for you both emotionally and physically. But you can 'play' some tricks with your mind, like distraction. We will be here and support you here no matter which way you feel. That's what I love at this BB. I can be positive, or negative, or anything inbetween, and I will find support here. At the support group for my 'other condition', they - the patients- only accept being positive, even with people that have a much worse prognosis than I have. I think that is not the way I want to go. You might want to check out the thread 'Be Positive-Shut up', I think its in the 'just diagnosed' forum, but I'm not sure.

Cancer is not a line in the sand.  It is a gradation.  If you heat a pot of water, at what temperature do you call it hot? So, depending on your definition of cancer, this would normally mean ALH, ADH, LCIS, and/or DCIS. They normally like to excise the area.  For ALH, ADH, and LCIS, they want to excise the area to make sure nothing worse is going on.  This means that sometimes they can find DCIS or invasive cancer in the area of the ALH/ADH/LCIS.  I have LCIS, and they called my excision 'verifying the diagnosis'.  None of these  (ALH/ADH/LCIS)require 'definitive treatment' - in other words, diligent screening is all that is required.  Some people opt for, in addition,  antihormonal therapy or, for LCIS, in extreme cases (usually a bad family history) possibly prophylactic bilateral mastectomies.  I have LCIS and my breast surgeon would not offer me PBMs. ( I have a weak family history. Some surgeons think it is extreme.) For DCIS, they want to excise all the DCIS,because DCIS is thought to be a precursor for cancer, so it does require definitive treatment. (The usual definitive treatment is usually lumpectomy+ radiation or mastectomy.) If you have ADH, and if you feel the least bit of discomfort with this diagnosis, you may want to consider a 2nd opinion on reading the slides, because the treatments for ADH and DCIS are different.  ",

For some breast cancers, they really need to remove the nipple, for example, when the breast cancer involves the nipple. If you keep the nipple, then some types of reconstruction are easier (so I understand.) From what I gather, it can be difficult for a plastic surgeon to make a very natural looking nipple.

Can means not only might there ever have been 1 case that has grown this fast, but can there THEORETICALLY be a breast cancer that grows at rate X.  Remember, theoretically, all the air on your side of the room can travel to the other side of the room, leaving you in a vacuum.  This is possible, but HIGHLY unlikely. Fibroadenomas (which are benign) can grow rapidly too.  Growth is not a good measure to find out if something is benign or malignant. But to answer your question, they tried to measure tumors mammographically in this study. Introduction Knowledge of tumor growth is important in the planning and evaluation of screening programs, clinical trials, and epidemiological studies. Studies of tumor growth rates in humans are usually based on small and selected samples. In the present study based on the Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program, tumor growth was estimated from a large population using a new estimating procedure/model. Methods A likelihood-based estimating procedure was used, where both tumor growth and the screen test sensitivity were modeled as continuously increasing functions of tumor size. The method was applied to cancer incidence and tumor measurement data from 395,188 women aged 50 to 69 years. Results Tumor growth varied considerably between subjects, with 5% of tumors taking less than 1.2 months to grow from 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter, and another 5% taking more than 6.3 years. The mean time a tumor needed to grow from 10 mm to 20 mm in diameter was estimated as 1.7 years, increasing with age. The screen test sensitivity was estimated to increase sharply with tumor size, rising from 26% at 5 mm to 91% at 10 mm. Compared with previously used Markov models for tumor progression, the applied model gave considerably higher model fit (85% increased predictive power) and provided estimates directly linked to tumor size. Conclusion Screening data with tumor measurements can provide population-based estimates of tumor growth and screen test sensitivity directly linked to tumor size. There is a large variation in breast cancer tumor growth, with faster growth among younger women.www.medisin.ntnu.no/ism/nofe/Konferanse_2008/arets_artikkel_2008.pdf Fibroadenomas can grow quickly too. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14519878 Imaging is not 100% reliable.  There are people who have had negative mammos, found a lump, and positive mammos within a few weeks.  That does NOT mean that the tumor grew from nothing to a detectable tumor in 1 month.   The usual figures you see about lumps is that most breast cancers (this does not mean ALL breast cancers) are thought to be in the body for some 6-10 years before they can be detected by ANY means.",

Mastalgia and breast cancer: a protective association? Khan SA, Apkarian AV. Department of Surgery, Northwestern Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. skhan@nmff.org Breast pain (mastalgia) is a common complaint, with a potentially important relationship to breast cancer risk. We have examined the association between mastalgia and breast cancer in the patient population of the Breast Care Center of University Hospital, Syracuse, New York. Of 5463 women with complete breast cancer risk factor information, 1532 (28%) reported breast pain as an incidental complaint at their initial visit, and 861 were diagnosed with breast cancer. Forward stepwise logistic regression was used to analyze the association between breast pain and a diagnosis of breast cancer. The age-adjusted OR for breast cancer was 0.60 (95% CI 0.50-0.74). Adjustment for additional risk factors (early menarche, late first birth, late menopause, exogenous hormone use, positive family history) yielded an OR of 0.63, 95% CI 0.49-0.79. Thus, women who experienced breast pain in our patient population were less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women who did not complain of breast pain, regardless of age, and of other breast cancer risk factors. Further investigation of this possible protective association is warranted. PMID: 12269765 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] In this study, it shows breast pain occurs in up to 70% of women. 1: Br J Hosp Med. 1990 May;43(5):330-2.Links Comment in: Br J Hosp Med. 1990 Sep;44(3):160-1.

After exclusion of breast cancer and proper reassurance, only 15% of patients initially presenting will require drug treatment. Using bromocriptine, danazol and evening primrose oil some 77% of patients treated can obtain useful relief of their symptoms. PMID: 2364227 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] In this group of women with breast cancer, 18% had breast pain as the initial symptom, followed, at different intervals, with a lump. 1: Eur J Surg Oncol. 1988 Jun;14(3):213-5.Links Localized mastalgia as presenting symptom in breast cancer. Fariselli G, Lepera P, Viganotti G, Martelli G, Bandieramonte G, Di Pietro S. Department of Diagnostic Oncology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milano, Italy. The importance of breast pain as a presenting symptom of breast cancer was assessed in 200 women with localized mastalgia but negative physical examination and in 478 women with operable breast cancer. In the first group, mammography detected five cases of subclinical breast cancer at the site of pain. In the second group, 86 patients (18%) reported localized pain as presenting symptom, followed, at different intervals, by the detection of a breast lump. Localized pain can be considered a presenting symptom of breast cancer thus requiring a careful physical and mammographic examination, especially when risk factors are associated. PMID: 3371473 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] So, of course, some women with breast pain do have cancer, but most women with breast cancer do NOT have pain as one of their first symptoms. Of course, I am urging you to get it thoroughly checked out, but most women with breast cancer do NOT have any pain as part of their initial symptoms. Hope this helps to reassure you.",

I started having carpal tunnel symptoms in 7-05, along with some numbness going up my arms. I had a spinal MRI which showed some disc bulging, bone spurs into my spine.  Was referred to a neurosurgeon who recommended C5-7 ACDF (anterior cervical discectomy with allograft and instrumentation) prophylactic.  He said he was concerned if I fell on my chin I'd have a spinal cord injury. (He worked at a trauma center, so I figured he knew.  He said his group had a 0% rate of osteomylelitis.) He did a 'roto-rooter' job on the nerves going out to my arms.  It was only *after* the surgery that I found he had drilled right next to my spinal cord. I was totally freaked out by the surgery. I don't know how long I was in the recovery room (at least 1-2 hours - I didn't have any bladder control in the recovery room.)  But not more than 1.5 hours out of the recovery room, I was walking up and down a flight of stairs (leashed by a PT).  I was under a 1 quart liquid or 2 pound lifting weight limit x 6-8 weeks (can't remember). No driving. Try that when you live alone and get groceries home or take the garbage out!  (After 5 trips to the grocery store/day, I was hanging grocery bags on my waist. Or I used my carryon with wheels.  I got a rubber band thing from PT to open heavy doors.)  When the store was out of quarts of milk, I tipped half-gallons into my grocery cart, and poured them into smaller containers on the ground.  You get creative. On one support group, I read a story about a guy who had an  ACDF and forgot his lifting limit and opened his car hood.  He had permanent damage.  So I was very careful not to exceed my lift restrictions. I was back to work 6-8 weeks after surgery.  I had a nurse consult (I can't remember the right term) to try to get you back to work faster.  She said mine was listed at 3-6 months so was shocked my doc had recommended shorter. At first, at work it was hard to even carry 2-1 liter IV bags or to pull the plug on the IV bags.  But gradually things got better.  (I worked alone in the pharmacy at night.)  I probably have some arthritis in my neck and arms, but I figure that's better than a spinal cord injury. Overall, I'm glad I had it done. Wishing you expert hands, and a very speedy recovery!",

Stereotactic is less invasive and produces less scar tissue.  Scar tissue can make reading later mammograms or other imaging very difficult to read.  However, since it takes less tissue, it can be harder to read, and can miss the 'area of concern'.  They often use local anesthetics alone. Excisional normally involves either conscious sedation or complete anesthesia, which can be more complex.  It is a surgical operation, so is more complex, takes longer, and is more expensive.  I am guessing that often now-a-days they often first do an MRI to plan surgery so they can try to get out the suspicious areas. Stereotactic means they use triangulation to locate the area of concern. I've had 2 stereotactic mammographic biopsies and one ultrasound biopsy.  (I also had an excisional with wires place before my excisional.) I don't know for sure, but I don't think there are stereotactic ultrasound biopsies  - maybe I'm wrong about this. There is also a fine needle biopsy that can usually be done in a doctor's office.  It is the least invasive, but there can be distortion of the sample (if the sample is a piece of tissue).  I don't know how they decide between the types of biopsy.  If it looks probable that a person might have invasive lobular carcinoma, I am guessing its likely they might do an excisional because that is a more 'sneaky' cancer and often forms sheets, not lumps, so its harder to detect.",

All good quality genetics testing programs that I have heard of require genetics counseling before genetics testing.  When genetics information is addressed by state law, I think different states can have different rules.  When the federal law goes into effect, that should, of course, apply to the whole country.  I would definitely ask about this when you go to your initial genetics counseling meeting. I got genetics counseling, and opted to not get testing (because my risk was low.)  I found it very helpful.   I think on the FORCE website, they often recommend getting a board-certified genetics counselor.  I think there are some genetics programs where the patient gets tested without counseling, but I would avoid them.  You need to know all the ramifications of testing before you get tested.  Then make your decision that is best for you.

Some of them have been fairly trivial. But some have been very frightening, particularly for the ones that are potentially life threatening. (So far, luckily, I have not been definitely diagnosed with really awful things, they've just wanted to prevent really awful things, but some may take years (due to slow disease onset, etc.) We all want to be ready for whatever is ahead of us on our path. People have a variety of different ways they deal with this situation. Some people consider biofeedback. Some people find therapy helps, or 'better living through chemistry' (such as antianxiety or antidepressants) , or some people find meditation helps. Some people find alternative therapies or religion helps. Some find distraction helps. Sometimes nothing helps. I think most people really find it valuable to have people (whether mental health professionals or just friends) listen to them in a non-judgemental way (which is a component of most psychotherapy.)

We often spent 8 hours there between the blood draws, chemo and radiaton.  I'm a hospital pharmacist, and though I've never worked in the cancer center, know a bit what goes on with preparing chemos.  They do have to check your blood work to make sure its OK, and often check with the doc if there are questions.  This can especially happen if there are questions about the lab values. It can be hard to get ahold of the onc if (s)he's busy seeing someone else. There are big ugly equations which have to be double checked.  Someone has to get all gowned up with chemo gloves to make the chemo (you feel like the Michelin man).  I don't know why they couldn't just use the last value if your height and weight and lab values aren't significantly different from the previous chemo. Sometimes they haven't ordered enough chemo. But that said, I don't see why there is any reason why you couldn't take a walk in the park while this was being done, and get called on your cell phone.

I don't know if this is your complete diagnosis, because apparently there are several types of nonpueperal mastitis.  Some papers I found referred to 'granulomatous', sometimes 'idiopathic'  and I don't know if that's what you have. I don't know if this paper's opinion is controversial or not, but this paper talked about diagnosing nonpuerperal mastitis by imaging. The incidence of non-puerperal mastitis, which is clinically reported as currently increasing but <10%, is lower than that of puerperal mastitis [ 1,2]. Non-puerperal mastitis is not a single specific histopathological entity but includes a wide spectrum of different disorders [2\u20136]. The most frequently used classification subtypes are subareolar abscess of the breast, mastitis complicating fibrocystic disease, inflammation of a cyst and plasma cell mastitis [10,20]. Non-puerperal mastitis usually affects females under 40 years old [5,10,11,13], which was reflected in our study (the mean age of our patients was 37.5years). Females with non-puerperal mastitis typically present with a breast mass that may be associated with pain, skin thickening or axillary adenopathy... Antibiotic treatment is the primary clinical option for non-puerperal mastitis; therefore, a correct diagnosis of non-puerperal mastitis should not require surgery.  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/artic...  I imagine you'll be seeing your doctor for followup, so it would be good to ask your doc.  You should be able to get a paper copy of your pathology report.

I don't think we have any evidence to support the idea that stress causes breast cancer.   Another example: if stress was a major cause of bc, wouldn't women with pre-existing PTSD have a higher incidence of bc?  I can't find any studies that support an association between the two. Breast cancer has been with us for a long time. According to this author, it has been seen in prehistoric times in ancient mummies. It first written documentation was probably in an Egyptian papyrus in 3000 BC.  Cancer was not a prevalent disease in antiquity, because most people did not live to old age.  But according to this author, breast cancer is mentioned a lot more in antiquity than other cancers.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/cncr.20198/asse/20198_ftp.pdf?v=1&t=gexgpke8&s=2cffbc008efedabb054e33e09ba72dfc0f3a8099 But, no matter what the data, since breast cancer tends to affect older women, and most women didn't live past roughly the age of 30 in prehistoric times,  I don't see how this supports one view or another. But nancyh is also right: no matter what causes bc, we can't go back in time.  Many people have unexpected bad things that happen to them.  We have to cope with the hand that life has given us.  I certainly don't want to tell anyone how to handle their situation.  I think its usually useful, in some degree at least, to look at how we feel about a situation.  I think its crazy to expect someone to react positively to a sad or negative situation, at least initially.  I think it can be damaging to tell *someone else* to act positively, no matter how you may choose to handle a bad situation.  Personally, I'm 'allergic' to crazy situations - for example, if someone's house burns down, you don't normally expect the residents to react with joy that they've lost their shelter and probably much of their earthly belongings.

If you have concerns about the wire insertion, I would definitely have a conversation with the radiologist BEFORE the procedure starts, and get straight what they are going to do IF you have pain and how you are to communicate with them. I was told not to move a muscle throughout the wire insertion. I have had general several times for other operations.

This is so they can try to find the mutation in the family. Once they find the mutation, then it is much easier (and cheaper) to JUST look for that particular mutation at that specific place in the mother and daughter.  If they wanted to look at someone's chance they had this mutation and they didn't have breast cancer, then they would just look at that particular place in the BRCA gene to see if they found the exact same mutation.  So in this case, if the daughter had a sister  (whether or not she had breast cancer)  they would still look for this one mutation. Its a lot easier and cheaper to test if you know what you are looking for. If your sister has the only breast and/or ovarian cancer in the family,  then (assuming you and your sister have the same parents - i.e. you aren't half sisters, and none were adopted) then you didn't get her mutation - because she didn't have one. It is theoretically possible, though the chances of this happening are like 1 in a zillion, that a cosmic ray could have struck your mother's ovaries and hit exactly the right gene to cause a mutation which you might pass on to your children, so theoretically you could have a BRCA mutation that you could pass on to your children.  But, again, the chances of this are astronomically small.   Only about 10% of breast cancers are associated with known genetic mutations. They will probably discover other mutations in the BRCA gene  , and other gene mutations that are associated with hereditary breast cancer in the future.  There is one, for example, the PTEN group, that is associated with an increased chance of breast cancer.  But there have only been about 300 people worldwide - ever to have been diagnosed with this- so these other gene mutations in other genes are very rare.  (PTEN 'only' puts you at about 25% breast cancer risk anyway, which is about the risk of a person with atypical hyperplasia.) So, we may find more information in the future, but that's all the  genetic testing we can do for now for BRCA genes.  That's what I understand, anyways.  It is good that you are being followed closely.   Your sister is so lucky to have a sister like you who cares about her, and a sister who is trying to take care of herself!",

They are describing the shape of something in the mammogram, and the shadows on ultrasound. Mammograms pick up maybe 80% of cancers.  With any imaging, there are false positives and false negatives. (False positive means the imaging sometimes picks up things that are NOT cancer, and false negative means the imaging does NOT pick up some cases of cancer.)  There is little in breast cancer that is 100%. Normally breast cancer is diagnosed by a pathologist by looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope.   Even if the breast surgeon decides to have the lesion biopsied, overall, about 80% of biopsies turn out to be benign.  If she is in a higher risk group, such as a postmenopausal woman with a lump, previous personal history of breast cancer, etc, then the statistics may not be quite so favorable.  About 70% of women with breast cancer have no obvious risk factors (besides being a woman.)  Here's a link to an overview of diagnosis. imaginis.com/breasthealth/diag...

Many women around here feel 'the best lump is in the jar' - in other words getting anything suspicious biopsied, particularly if it is recommended. The choice is clearly up to you, and the bottom line is that you need to pursue this until you feel comfortable with the results. I can find very few scientific papers that think they may have found cases of breast cancer where the cancer was spread in the breast through the needle track. Its a very small number. I think in most of these cases, the patient was not properly treated for her cancer. Breast cancer is different than many other cancers. **** If****** they find breast cancer, and you are concerned about seeding along the needle track, ask them to excise the cancer along the needle track. Treatment will almost certainly take care of any straggling cells. Presently, there really is no way to diagnose breast cancer besides looking at a piece of tissue under the microscope. It is clearly your call, but if I were in your shoes, I'd go for biopsy.",

There is no one path that is right for everyone.  We are all individuals.   Some women with ADH do like to get their slides re-read (if they weren't read at a Major Institution) because ADH can be confused with DCIS, and they are treated differently. Have you been excised?  I think they normally like to do that.  (It is optional for ALH and LCIS in some circumstances.)  They often like to excise becase sometimes they find something worse in the area. Yes, tamoxifen can have side effects.  But do realize there are VERY FEW medications where EVERYONE has a certain side effect. (I'm a pharmacist.)  I am not saying that tamoxifen is for everyone. Different studies will have different numbers. I am not sure if you are worried about the most severe side effects,the possible stroke and endometrial carcinoma issues. Here's what the Mayo clinic says about tamoxifen http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR601293 It is an individual choice.  Part of it is emotional.  We do not know what the possibility of breast cancer means to you emotionally, and what the possibility of blood clots or endometrial cancer mean to you.  We don't know your family history, or your other personal risk factors for each condition.  They may influence your decision. My oncologist says that cancer is like looking for something with a flashlight in a room with no light.  You can see part of the picture, but not the whole picture.  You are often given choices because there are unknowns.   You do have the option of taking tamoxifen for a while, and if you don't like it, you can stop. Some people like that.  But others choose not to go on tamoxifen, or choose tamoxifen no matter what.  There is NO CORRECT choice - there is only the choice that is right for YOU - that only you can decide. If you look at the antihormonal forum, you may get a distorted view - many people post when they do have problems with a medication, but are much less motivated to post when they have no problems with a medication. I'm sure this chart won't come out properly,but it is from the Nolvadex package insert p 14 It is comparing the women who took tamoxifen in high risk situations vs the women who took placebo.  There's more to this, but its really hard to post.  http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:_ctvFTRTavMJ:mesomorphosis.com/downloads/uspi-nolvadex.pdf+Nolvadex+%2B+package+insert&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a",

About maybe 20-30% of people with LCIS get something worse upon excision. Almost everything about LCIS is controversial.  Yes, some places use the term lobular neoplasia (for both LCIS and ALH), but I see probably more academic papers refer to LCIS than lobular neoplasia. Yes, LCIS is thought to be MOSTLY only a risk factor for breast cancer.  However, they now think in a SMALL number of cases LCIS may be a nonobligate precursor for cancer.  I think many places do use the term LCIS because that's the term that the pathologists that invented the category called it - they were very prominent pathologists.  Of course, they didn't know the natural history  of LCIS at the time and thought it was like DCIS.  Traditionally, before, say, the mid-1990s, the routine treatment for LCIS was bilateral mastectomies.  Now most breast surgeons consider that pretty much over-kill, unless you have a bad family history or BRCA positive. BRCA is a higher risk factor for breast cancer than LCIS is.  My oncologist and genetics counselor gave me a ballpark lifetime risk of bc of about 30%, though I also have been given figures as low as 10% and as high as 85% (the 85% in a breast cancer calculator that has NOT been compared to populations, so is VERY SUSPECT.) (I have a weak family history.) If you do have LCIS and nothing worse,  if you disregard your earlier ILC (I don't know how that will affect things), the usual treatments  for LCIS and nothing worse are one of the following: a) watchful waiting (mimimum biannual clinical exam + yearly mammo) b) Watchful waiting (as above ) + antihormonal such as tamoxifen c) Bilateral prophylactic mastectomies, usually for people with a bad family history/BRCA. I'm so sorry you are going through this waiting. Hang in there.  We're hoping for a clean bill of health for you!",

If I understand it correctly, IF a microcalcification is going to be something of a concern, then its most commonly DCIS.  It is possible to have invasive.  But what I'm trying to say is that I think often microcalcifications  -if they aren't benign - are usually a sign of early breast cancer.  It is thought that most breast cancer has been in the breast for some 4-10 years before it can be detected by ANY means. So while it may drive you insane, it probably won't mean a lot clinically. I don't have implants, but I did have a mammo and ultrasound where they wanted to biopsy 2 places in the same breast-one stereotactically and the other ultrasound.  They wanted to do them the same day, but they couldn't schedule them that way.  I had the stereotactic first, then a week later I had the ultrasound guided one.  My breast was pretty swollen for the ultrasound one, and it looked pretty awful because I had a hematoma.  But I'm the only one besides my doctors that look at my breasts.  Eventually, it turned back to normal-looking. Different people do have different experiences, but most of mine have been done by doctors who cared.  They have said-if you have pain-complain.  They should stop and give more anesthetic.  If they don't talk about this before the procedure, then  *before the procedure starts* ask them what you should do IF you have pain.",

If someone in the family has a known mutation, testing other family members for the same mutation can provide information about their cancer risk. If a person tests negative for a known mutation in his or her family, it is unlikely that they have an inherited susceptibility to cancer associated with BRCA1 or BRCA2. Such a test result is called a \u201ctrue negative.\u201d Having a true negative test result does not mean that a person will not develop cancer; it means that the person\u2019s risk of cancer is probably the same as that of people in the general population. <emphasis mine> In cases in which a family has a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and no known mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 has been previously identified, a negative test result is not informative. It is not possible to tell whether an individual has a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation that was not detected by testing (a \u201cfalse negative\u201d) or whether the result is a true negative. In addition, it is possible for people to have a mutation in a gene other than BRCA1 or BRCA2 that increases their cancer risk but is not detectable by the test(s) used. 2. What does an ambiguous BRCA1 or BRCA2 test result mean? If genetic testing shows a change in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that has not been previously associated with cancer in other people, the person\u2019s test result may be interpreted as \u201cambiguous\u201d (uncertain). One study found that 10 percent of women who underwent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation testing had this type of ambiguous result (16).Because everyone has genetic differences that are not associated with an increased risk of disease, it is sometimes not known whether a specific DNA change affects a person\u2019s risk of developing cancer. As more research is conducted and more people are tested for BRCA1 or BRCA2 changes, scientists will learn more about these changes and cancer risk http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA So, I am guessing that if you have tested positive for a  deleterious BRCA1 and/or 2 mutation, and your daughter has a true negative for the BRCA1 and 2 mutation, then it is likely that she won't have to undergo any screening until people in the general population do. But obviously, I'd check with your genetic counselor about this.",

But the big picture is not like that.  Breast cancer is not an automatic death sentence. Mammogram is the best initial screening that we have right now.  From the study above, it looks like it usually picks up tumors as small as 5-10mm.  But mammograms are certainly not perfect.   For example, in this study, mammograms detected about 80% of ILCs. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19155397 Different studies will differ.  Younger women tend to have more dense breasts, which make it harder to read mammograms, and the density is probably associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Hang in there.  You will soon have more answers.  Feel free to ask questions or vent.",

The most common single gene for breast cancer is a BRCA 1 or 2 gene, and the US Preventative task force says:  Both maternal and paternal family histories are important. For non-Ashkenazi Jewish women, these patterns include 2 first-degree relatives with breast cancer, 1 of whom received the diagnosis at age 50 years or younger; a combination of 3 or more first- or second-degree relatives with breast cancer regardless of age at diagnosis; a combination of both breast and ovarian cancer among first- and second-degree relatives; a first-degree relative with bilateral breast cancer; a combination of 2 or more first- or second-degree relatives with ovarian cancer regardless of age at diagnosis; a first- or second-degree relative with both breast and ovarian cancer at any age; and a history of breast cancer in a male relative. For women of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, an increased-risk family history includes any first-degree relative (or 2 second-degree relatives on the same side of the family) with breast or ovarian cancer. About 2 percent of adult women in the general population have an increased-risk family history as defined here. Women with none of these family history patterns have a low probability of having a deleterious mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.  http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf05/brcagen/brcagenrs.htm#clinical First degree relatives include a mother, sister, or daughter.  Second degree relatives include a grandparent or aunt. But who wouldn't be anxious?  Good for you for sticking to your guns and showing up to get the 2nd biopsy done.  Let us know how it goes, OK?",

Calcifications are not because you eat too much calcium or that you have something wrong with your parathyroid gland. For me, the calcifications were suspicious. My breast was big enough to do a stereotactic biopsy. They needed a week or two to get it OKed by my insurance. Just like Dukemom says, even IF you proceed to biopsy, 80% of biopsies are benign. As Dukemom says, its normal to be nervous.

I did not realize that 'going all over my breast' would cause more scar tissue, and a subsequent biopsy, inches away from the surgical site, was 'consistent with scar tissue'.  I've never had any breast lumps (except the swelling for a few months after surgery), but that faded over time and now my breasts are as soft as they were before surgery. While nothing worrisome (nothing worse than the LCIS that I already had) has been found since 2006, surgical excision can cause scar tissue which can make it harder to read future mammograms.  I don't know how prevalent this is, but I have heard that some surgeons can freeze or oblate fibroadenomas.  I don't know if that would cause less scarring or not. Its easy to have 20-20 hindsight, but if I had the excision to do over again, I probably would not have told the surgeon to 'go all over my breast'.  However, if she had found ILC in a far corner of the breast, then I'd probably be glad I told her to go all over my breast. Since you would be having a fibroadenoma removed which is at a set location, you would probably have less scar tissue after this surgery than I had, but its just something else to consider. I agree with Chrissy: since it is causing you discomfort, it sounds like you'd prefer to remove it.  But you may want to explore/ask about different methods of removal with regard to scar production.",

You already had a breast biopsy, so you'd have that box checked off anyways. Also know while we are pretty good at predicting the number of women in a group who will get breast cancer, we are absolutely awful at predicting which individual that will be.  jnci.oxfordjournals.org/conten...   In other words, unless you have a known BRCA mutation, a strong family history (such as first degree relatives who have breast cancer before the age of 50, or ovarian cancer), or have been exposed to large doses of radiation to the chest (such as treatment for lymphoma; *not* diagnostic chest Xrays), we only have a very poor idea of whether *you* (an individual) will get breast cancer. I had about 2 tablespoonfulls of breast tissue removed.  I have a B cup.  I had a slight dent for a few months after surgery, but it all filled in.  I don't know how big your fibroadenoma is, but for me, it would be hard for someone to tell if and where I had my excision.",

I found this on this website, apparently from an anesthesiologist: Moderate sedation is also known as \"conscious sedation\" - a bit of a misnomer really. There is a common misconception that sedation acts like a \"truth serum\" and that patients are compelled whilst in this twilight zone to divulge secret and embarrassing personal details. If only it were that exciting! In more than 15 years of anesthetic practice I have yet to take care of a patient who has revealed to me any juicy secrets! It is true however that sedated patients sometimes become a bit disinhibited, much as an inebriated person under the influence of alcohol might behave. This could be an embarrassing experience, however the amnesia effect means that you are unlikely to remember what you said. Whether this is a good or bad thing depends I suppose on your perspective. The goal of the anesthetic state is to allow the surgical procedure to be accomplished quickly, safely and effectively. A patient who is behaving in a disinhibited, drunken state will very quickly be given more anesthesia (or, sometimes, less) in order to create better conditions for the surgical procedure to take place. Unfortunately, the treatment of medical and surgical conditions sometimes involves the inevitable loss of one's physical dignity for a period of time. Hopefully the highest ethical standards surround the care we deliver. Let's recall that doctors and other healthcare providers are meant to observe the highest levels of respect for a patient's privacy. We all become patients at one time or another in our lives, and hopefully we learn to accept the occasional embarrassment or loss of physical dignity with humor, in return for the benefit of excellent and compassionate care. www.netwellness.org/question.c...",

Different doctors and different insurancers have different opinions.  Different countries probably have different opinions.  (For example, I have classic LCIS, and my breast surgeon told me she 'did not want to do any further surgery on me'.  But the risk of future bc for LCIS patients (at least do not have further more intense risk factors) is much less than many BRCA + patients.) When I had genetic counseling (I was not at high enough risk to qualify for insurance covering testing), they wanted (if possible) actual death certificate diagnoses. If they do genetic testing, they usually want to test people who a) are alive and b) actually had breast or ovarian cancer.  They want this information because often times, particularly decades ago, there were often 'family myths' - that the person had 'stomach' cancer rather than ovarian, or pancreatic cancer instead of ovarian, or if they had breast cancer and it spread to the brain, they would say they had brain cancer, etc.  I know with my grandmother, who was diagnosed with bc in the early 1950s, I was told the subject of breast cancer or cancer was taboo.  Even 50 years later, some 30 years after my grandmother's death, the subject was somewhat taboo.  I guess this was partly because she had only sons, and the diseases of breasts were not a popular subject for her sons.

They may or may not give you an injectable local anesthetic before the wire insertion. At my place, the radiologists insert the wire.  At my place, they can't give you IV sedation for the wire insertion because they don't have RNs in attendance. They only had the radiologist and the radiology tech. I had to be on NPO (nothing by mouth) status as of midnight the night before, so even if I had been very anxious, any oral seditative I would have taken at midnight would have worn off by the time I had the wire insertion at about noon. If you have pain, complain. People vary widely as far as their experiences with wire insertion.  Most (the majority) find it tolerable, but some have a more difficult time.You may want to ask the radiologist beforehand what (s)he wants you to do in the unlikely event you do have pain.They had to run in and out of the room a lot, because they had to develop the mammograms.  They shouldn't have to do that for ultrasound - it should be a lot faster and more comfortable with ultrasound. Then a while later (for me it was about 3 hours because my surgeon had a family emergency), you will go in to surgery.  They started an IV then because they would have doctors and nurses in attendance. I had conscious sedation.  That means I was semi-aware while it was going on.  Every time I tried to say anything at all, the anesthesiologist gave me more sedative. It was an outpatient procedure.  I went in at about 9am, and I got out of the recovery room about 8pm.   Under normal circumstances, you could cut at least 6 hours out of that time period, because there were numerous delays (emergencies, etc.). Bring an old book or whatever to entertain yourself as you wait.  If you want to bring an iPod, ask first.  You will be not functioning during surgery, so there may be a risk of losing it during that time.... Beforehand, make sure you have a tight bra (like a jogbra). The type that opens in the front is particularly handy, because you don't have to contort to get it on. I also liked TINY ice packs.  You will be swollen after surgery.   I wore my jogbra 24/7 for about 2 weeks (except for doing the laundry and showers.)  I went back to work 24 hours after release from the recovery room.  (I work the graveyard shift.)  If I did it again, I might want to take an additional day off.  I found tiny ice packs controlled the weird sensations a lot better than pain meds did....but everyone is different. I didn't have any armpit surgery, so you may want some extra leeway for that.  There are women who have had outpatient mastectomies.",

They know that LCIS is often multifocal (in other words, there are usually multiple spots of it in a breast), and is often (not always) bilateral, meaning it occurs in both breasts.  I assume this is the case with ALH too.  (I have both LCIS and ALH.)  So, if they were going to try to 'remove all the LCIS and ALH', they would have to sample every part of both breasts (to find the parts that were normal and which had ALH or LCIS), which, in effect, is a mastectomy. In addition, they don't know if the ALH and/or LCIS is the 'bad thing' that is happening in the breast.  What does that mean?  It means that of the women that, after a diagnosis of LCIS, go on in future years to get invasive breast cancer, the invasive breast cancer is often (not always)  in an area that looked totally normal on imaging, *not* at the areas that have known LCIS.  So that's why they think that *some* LCIS is not actually a precursor to breast cancer, but is a marker for something else that puts you at an increased risk of breast cancer.  If you were magically able to remove all the LCIS spots and leave the normal spots in the breast, we may have decreased the breast cancer risk, but maybe not so much.  They can't do this experiment, of course, because we have no way of knowing what areas in the breast have ALH or LCIS without biopsying them.  They have done experiments to see when invasive breast cancer is diagnosed at the same time as LCIS, if the two are genetically related.  Sometimes they are, but sometimes they are not. BTW, if you choose to do 'watchful waiting' (i.e. followed closely), you may, or may not, just do mammos.  For LCIS, which is normally thought to be of higher risk than ALH, the NCCN recommends once yearly mammograms, and twice-a-year clinical exams, and that's it.  That's what I get, and I have classic LCIS and ALH.http://www.nccn.com/files/cancer-guidelines/breast/index.html#/60/ There is a wide variety of opinion as to the increased risk of ALH.  If you have a weak family history (in other words, don't meet the usual guidelines for BRCA testing www.uspreventiveservicestaskfo... then the usual opinions are that the lifetime risk of breast cancer for a woman with ALH is *roughly* say 20% (as opposed to 13% lifetime risk for the 'average' US woman.)  I have seen estimates of anywhere between '10% and 60%' for me, with my ALH and LCIS.  (My weak family history includes bc in one paternal grandmother, 3 maternal aunts, all postmenopausal, 2 maternal cousins, one premenopausal.) No one can make a decision for you.  It is your body, and it not only depends on your specific circumstances, it also includes how much anxiety each of the choices entail for you.  Each choice entails upsides and downsides.  There is no rush to make your  choice.  There is no one good choice that fits everyone's circumstances.",
