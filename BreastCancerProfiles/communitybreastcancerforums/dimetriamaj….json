      "Content": "Apr 17, 2017 09:07AM - edited Apr 17, 2017 09:07AM by dimetriamajor1  Hello, I'm new to this diagnosis, I'm scare and angry because I go every year to get a mammogram to prevent this from happen, but I know that mammogram do not catch a small portion, but my cancer was 4.0 CM in front of my breast and the breast ultra or mammogram did not catch it because the machine was out dated and needed updated software. Maybe if I had a chance to get this disease in the early stages, I could have saved my breast from being removed immediately. I'm in pain all the time and very numb, I'm on hormone therapy, but scare of chemo or radiation, need help to cope.",

I thinking about opting out of chemo because it gives you other ailments and I feel that I'm not the right person to deal with this right now they didn't find any more cancer in me but the chemo is too just to make sure that there is nothing left in me I'm really afraid alone I have a good support network I have a giant church and a big big family but I live by myself and it's hard when you wake up in the Midnight Hour and your mind start thinking about the things that you have to go through just to make sure you're clean I do want to get rid of cancer but i don't want to get heart disease and I don't want to gain weight lose weight but I can't sleep and crying all the time which I find myself doing a lot so I need somebody to come and encourage me right now cause I really need it thank you ",
