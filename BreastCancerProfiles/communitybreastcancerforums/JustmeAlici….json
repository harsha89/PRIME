My first Taxol treatment #5 went smoothly.  I took my 5 decadron last night and an ambien so I did get a few hours sleep.  I was so anxious this am I couldn't eat, I took a bagel wrapped up with me.  I managed to eat it before my drip started.  They first gave me more decadron through an iv drip, then benadryl in a drip.  Finally at 1 they started my Taxol.  They sat with me and waited said, allergic reaction usually happens within the first 10 mins.  I had no problem.  She left me to drip for 3 1/2 hours.  We watched a movie and I fell asleep on and off.  My sister in law brought us a sandwich to split and cookies for my chemo nurses.  That was nice.  I feel ok - just put lasagna I made over the weekend in the oven.  I am exhausted and going to hit the couch.  Hope everyone had a smooth treatment day as well.

Brenda ~ my mri showed an enlarged lymph node.  It also showed up on ultrasound.  They were convinced it was cancer.  So they took them out and low and behold they weren't.  So the tests can be wrong and at the same time they can be a blessing. I asked my oncologist about having a pet scan after I am done with chemo. She said not necessary.  Being I was an stage 2 with no nodes.  They don't like to go looking for something that is highly unlikely to be there.  She said and then they get stuff that glows and is nothing, causes anxiety and biopsies.  She will be checking me closely for a few weeks after chemo is done and then every 3 months blood work and stuff.  I feel comfortable with that.  I start tamoxifen in April which is 2 weeks after my reconstruction surgery.  UGH !!! In steroid rage today.  Fighting with hubby and gutted the home of two garbage bags full of I am not sure.  Whatever wasn't appealing to me and looked like clutter.  I so can't wait to be done with all of this crap !!!!!!!!!!!  I hate pills, chemo, my bald egg head, my bloated self.... and the fatigue........  BUT, this too shall pass right?!

Nettie ~ I too found it so hard to lose the eyebrows and lashes!  It was truly worse then losing the hair.  I think it just really made my look scream \"I have CANCER\".  But I will tell you my last chemo was 2/8 and I have eyebrows coming back in and a lot of short budding top eyelashes.  Still none on the bottom, strange?!  Hi Michele ~ hope you are feeling good. To everyone else I hope you are are doing well.  I am still really in pain from this darn exchange.  Hoping I didn't make a mistake with saline they are hard!!!!!!!!! Hugs ~ Alicia",

Here goes again.  Betsy ~ thank you so much for popping in and giving us some great information.  I hope you are feeling good and getting on with life as best as one could after this awful blow of BC. Becca ~ I am glad you are feeling good !  :)  Yes, the wig is a good idea to have on hand.  Sometimes for you sometimes maybe to comfort another who is uncomfortable.  For example: my kids friends ~ when they come over I find 15 and 10 year olds get all nervous and don't want to see me sick.  Nor do I want my kids to feel uncomfortable.  So I plop one on my head.  They will help you at the Wig place pick one out that matches your hairstyle and color or you can have fun and go crazy too ! Mouse ~ So happy you had a nice day with your daughter and enjoyed New Moon.  I love that whole series and have read every book.  (hence a 15 year old DD too) :) Shara ~ I hope you are feeling good. Mabelle ~ Your exercise class sounds wonderful !  I am sure it is good to keep the body strong while going through all of this.  I used to exercise all the time ~ now since I've been diagnosed with the dreaded \"c\" word, the depression just doesn't give me the will.  I do go for a walk now and then and clean the house that is like an aerobic workout for me !!!  :)  I may have to dust off the treadmill or bike, HECK full gym I have in my basement as chemo is just making me be one of the blessed girls that is gaining WEIGHT! I can't page back so to all my other sisters here, BrendaSharon you will always be our LEADER even if you don't feel good or are having a Whimpy DAY!  And Ccnani is always here to cheer us ON too ~ Mommy2two, Cafelovr, Doronet and everyone else I am forgetting.  I think of you all each day and am thankful to have your friendship and support here.

Littlebird ~ glad you made in through your fatherinlaws funeral and that is behind you.  I hope you are feeling ok.  Sorry about your vein thing.  I hear the chemo can unfortunately damage our veins.  I hope it heals.  I am sure you pulled off that scarf great, you look good in your avatar! :) Pam ~ glad you went comfy in a scarf to DH's Christmas party !  I am sure you looked beautiful.  I too am missing my nose hairs.  My nose is either running...or soo dry.  No happy medium.  Hope you are feeling good.  :) To everyone else have a good Sunday with your family and friends.......  To everyone who willl be in the chemo room like me tomorrow.  Hugs my Warrior Princesses it will be \"another one bites the dust\" on our chemo list !!!  Hugs ~ Alicia",

I am hopping on one foot. I broke my leg, well more like shattered my tibia in a fall down my porch steps. (fell onto hard bluestone) I was watering the flowers at about 8:30 at night on my porch and missed a step I guess and came a tumbling down. I needed to have surgery to put a plate in and several pins. I am now in a cast for 6 weeks. (well it comes off for a few mins in 2 weeks to take stiches out from surgery). Then goes back on. I cannot bear weight on my foot for 6 weeks. And it is my driving foot. So I am stuck home. And with the upper body not good from double mast, and several lymph nodes on each side removed I am not so steady on crutches either. So this is a very trying time for me. I can do basically nothing around the house and it is killing me. I watch tv most of the day and then get myself to the porch and read a bit. At least I have the kids home for a few more days then they start school next Wednesday. I will really be doomed home alone. I am thinking it of a diet plan because I can't get up and get to food !! OH MY gotta laugh or I will cry. (which I do almost daily) Pam Happy Cancerversary !!!! Sounds like everyone is doing well.  Hoping you are all going to have a wonderful Labor Day weekend ...  it is so sad to see the summer go.  HUGS, Alicia",

Kimmy ~ good luck today.  We will be with you in that chair....  in spirit and prayer. Cafelovr ~ Yes they do that blood draw back on me too.  It didn't happen Monday so they shot me a second time to get a better vein.  UGH !  The last drops of the Cytoxin do that to my sinuses too. Strange feeling.  Watch the headaches.  They can get bad ~ don't chase it.  Try 2 tylenol and then switch to motrin if your dr says it's ok.  I got furicet.  They work wonders.  Hope you get some rest today ....  try the Claritin after the Neulasta seems to help me.  SLV ~ not sure if you will require the Neulasta I know each cocktail is different.  Sometimes they wait and see how your blood count is I think too.  Mommy2two ~ thank for the compliment.  (i still say YUCK) I have a different wig on now took my son to the bus stop didn't want to scare the little kids.  I will post this one tomorrow.  It is a monofilament one ~ better then the last pic.  But I still like the other one.  This is a different style and color.  I may as well try to have some fun with these darn things.  This one isn't soo itchy.

I will say Stage 2 girls, that being 1 year post treatment the anxiety does go to the back of your mind somewhat.  There are days I don't think about it and other days I am anxious.  But I know that it is truly out of my hands, I am behind the wheel but not driving this car'  so I try to be as healthy as I can, exercise, swallow my tamoxifen and Live LIFE ! Have a great day girls. :) Alicia",
