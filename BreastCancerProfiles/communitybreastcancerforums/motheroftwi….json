They did a ultrasound on lump, radiologist and dr both agree that its jump my dense breast tissue. the area they could not actually see a lump they could see shadowing but it shadowed all over the breast as well. So they said it no mass. I then went sent down for a stero biospy on the micro calcs. The procedure was not bad at all... More scary then anything... The told me they will call me tomorrow for the results.. I am patiently waiting..I am not as scared.. Since the orginal hospital told me 50/50 odds of cancer but the ca center said more like 15-20 percent .. That is a big relief.... Praying for b9 tomorrow..",

I just got home, but I wanted to post my breast surgeon visit. He diagnosed me with IDC Stage 2 Estrogen+Progesterone+ they say invasive poorly differentiated duct caricoma at least 2.4 cm, I am trying to pull some quick info from my pathology report.. Positive for Angiolymphatic invasion, Intraductal carcinoma, cribriform, micropapillary, and clinging types, high nuclear grade with comedonecrosis. I am now schedule for a MRI for monday and then will meet the genetic counsler. Then on wednesday will meet for results and meet with all the drs for a (round table) go thru my results and see what they recommend.. The breast surgeron said he thinks I will definetly need chemo, radation, hormone therapy..  Thank you for everyone advice, I took my husband and sister in a law.. My sister in law tape recorded  everything.. and they dr actually gave me notes and my copies of everything without having to ask.. which really helped me.. I am so overwelmed and I am wiped out for the night... I will talk more later. And I will try to go to IDC forum..  thanks again",
