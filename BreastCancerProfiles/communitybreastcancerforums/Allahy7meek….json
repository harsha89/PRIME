I have a quick question though,, what exactly do the doctors remove in the surgery,, the whole breast or a part of it? And does cancer spread in the body fast? Because the doctor has not given us an appointement for the surgery yet, it might be 2 weeks or even more till the surgery. Is that bad? Will cancer spread to other parts of the body if we wait for weeks for the surgery? Shouldl we change to another doctor that would operate sooner?",
