I was laying there in the prone position and the techs were calling out numbers, drawing on me, and then tattooing my body. I was alone, without anyone and I just wanted to cry. However, I could only let one tear fall because I couldn't move to wipe it. It was cold in the room and I started to feel really cold. Finally it was over and I could leave. I was relieved. After I left, I broke down. It was almost like a slap in the face to remind me that I have Cancer. I had recovered from surgery and was doing great then, all of a sudden, this. I went the next two days for treatment and it didn't take near as long. I asked the tech if it was going to get easier and her response was, yes. And it was easier each day. I have the same techs and same machine, everyday. Three treatments down and twenty-seven to go!",

My Breast is pink, swollen, & tender. My RO was concerned so she placed some things on my breast to measure the actual radiation that my skin was getting. (She was concerned that I was getting too much.) However, the measurements were good. So, this is just SE that I will have to deal with. I'm kinda bummed out about it. I now need a bigger bra. Congrats to all of you that are finishing up! I know that is a burden lifted. Now it's time to get back to enjoying your life!",

      "Content": "Jul 26, 2016 06:43PM - edited Jul 26, 2016 06:44PM by MelancholyInNC I am almost three weeks post RADs. I grew to hate RADs as much as I hated cancer. I had a terrible time. It started after the third treatment, my breast was swollen, red, and tender. My RO thought that I had a an infection from surgery. I explained to her that these symptoms did not start until I started radiation. After a couple of weeks, my nipple peeled. My RO put a block on my nipple after that, thank goodness. If not, I swear it would have burned completely off. Then about four weeks into it, the area under my breast started to breakdown. I had to start Domeboro soaks 3x/day then use Silvadene cream. It was so painful. I started taking Tramadol while working just to get through the day. I even started taking something for sleep. It got to a point that I couldn't even raise my arm above my shoulder because the skin was so tight. Then, the area under my arm opened so I started the soaks and Silvadene there as well. Then it was time for the boost. A couple days after I finished the boost, that area opened. So, I started Domeboro soaks there and the Silvadene cream. On the fourteenth day post RADs, my skin was finally closed. I was so relieved! Now, I could finally soak in a tub! I am off the pain and sleeping meds now. The swelling has gone down and it is no longer that tender. My skin now looks darker than normal. The boost area still has some pinkness to it. It has been a journey that I hated. I just hope and pray that the Radiation did it's job. Now, I get to start the Tamoxifen. #cancersucks",
