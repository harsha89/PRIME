Adopted and since finding my birth mom she did have cancer in one breast and a mastectomy. But, she was already 70. I have decided upon a prophylactic bi-lateral mastectomy with immediated reconstruction. My breast surgeon will be doing the nipple and skin sparing surgery and the plastic surgeon will be using tissue expanders. My surgery is August 23rd. I really wanted the implant right away (or thought I did) but the PS insists I have to do the TE. She came highly recommended to me and when my insurance notified me they were covering this I did not want to change everything midstream and risk losing the coverage. I want to have this all completed prior to September 1st and medicare kicking in. This is such a great forum and each of you are so special for sharing and helping others. Way to go. I am 64, weigh 228, 40 DD/D(lumpectomy side).",
