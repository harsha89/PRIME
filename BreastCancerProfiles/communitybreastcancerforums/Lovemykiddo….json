The lump I felt was ducta ectesia ( blocked milk ducts) Fibrocystic breast's are a benign condition and I hope that your doctor is correct and that you find a peace of mind after the Ultrasound. I would call their office and see if they can fit you in sooner in case they have a cancellation. Good luck! I know it can be very scary! Try to follow the advice other wonderful women gave me earlier. It really helped me",
