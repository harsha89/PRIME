I was diagnosed almost 10 years ago (on my 40th bday) that I had triple negative BC on my left breast. I was treated with chemo and radiation (lumpectomy) and have been doing quite well. Fast foward to now (almost my 50th bday) and a routine MRI showed \"linear nonmass enhancement\" on my right side. All the research I have done on this is so confusing. I spoke to both my oncologist and breast surgeon who both say we will only know what it is after they receive the pathology report which I have an a biopsy scheduled for theis upcoming Wednesday . This is different from 10 years ago a school I discovered lump. Now there is no lump. Does anyone know what this type of diagnosis usually means? waiting is so stressful!! And I just feel the horrors of history repeating again (but the results may be worse) Thank you! Log in to post a reply",
