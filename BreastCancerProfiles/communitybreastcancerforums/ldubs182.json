I asked if she wanted to see me again and she said \"well, if you want....you can come back in 6 weeks, if it makes you feel better.\" I will ask for a biopsy then.  Thanks again, everyone. I hope to come back with positive news. ",

It's at 2 O'clock.  I have been told by 2 doctors, 1 breast surgeon and 1 radiologist that it's nothing to worry about. Here is my story: I am 25 years old, with no known history of BC in the family. The night before Easter of this year, I was woken up by pain in my left breast when my cat stepped on me. I didn't think much of it, but when I felt the spot I noticed a lump. I made an appointment at my gyno right away. I saw a nurse practitioner. After feeling the lump and seeing how much pain I was in, she told me it was probably a cyst but sent me for an ultrasound at a breast clinic. The radiologist told me the lump was a swollen lymph node and there was nothing to worry about. From there, I waited until my annual appointment at my gyno, which happened in June. (this time I saw my usual doctor, not the nurse practitioner) I told my doctor that I was still in a lot of pain, and the lump was still there. She told me she wasn't concerned, but sent me to a breast surgeon for a second opinion. I saw the breast surgeon in early July. When she took a look at my ultrasound, she said \"well, not much to see there,\" and said she didnt see anything weird, abnormal or suspicious. She told me to reduce my coffee intake and take vitamin E and evening primrose oil, and wants to see me back in 6 weeks. After 4 opinions and an ultrasound, I am still not satisfied with the findings. I have a strange feeling that all is NOT well. If there is nothing wrong, why am I in so much pain? I just worry that I am being brushed off by the doctors because of my age. But things like this are taken seriously at any age...right??? I don't know what to do now.

      "Content": "ldubs182 wrote: Hi everyone. I have posted only a couple times before. I am 26. All of this started back in April, 2013 (still 25 at the time). I noticed a lump when my cat stepped on me...it HURT! Since then the pain is constant and the lump does not change. (I notice a decrease in pain when I have my period) I went in for a breast exam at my OBGYN. At my age she assumed it was just a cyst. I had an ultrasound done and they didn't see anything suspicious, just an enlarged lymph node. I followed up with a breast surgeon in July, who didn't seem too concerned and she couldn't feel a distinct lump (I sure could!). Well, it's been 10 months and nothing has changed. I went back to the breast surgeon yesterday. This time she could definitely feel the lump and said it was more distinct than my last visit in July. She performed an ultrasound right then and there. Said she didn't see a solid mass or anything suspicious. She then performed a core needle biopsy. She kept saying she doesn't \"suspect\" there is anything scary going on. But I am having trouble staying positive. I am getting married in 3 months and the thought of starting treatment during \"the happiest time of my life\" sure is a buzzkill. I know this is all premature worry.... I will know the results on Friday. Just wanted to post in case anyone had gone through something similar and for support during these difficult days of waiting.  Log in to post a reply",

Like you, Kwilliams, I have a strange feeling that all is NOT well. If there is nothing wrong, why am I in so much pain?",
