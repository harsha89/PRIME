All chairs but the recliner hurt. Hoping tomorrow and Monday are okay. I've got two at home with colds. From what I understand Thanksgiving to Sunday will be my immune compromising events. We were to go to my sister's house. 12 of us. However her husband has prostate cancer and so he invited his 12 family (who are known to bring kids with fevers and vomiting to family functions). Normally not a problem, but we are bowing out. My husband's family and mine all live within 15 minutes of each other and we live 2 hours away. I hate to go down to see my mom and his mom but not the rest of the family but I've got 3 kids of my own and a working husband and two jobs. I've got to cut down my risks. Thanks for listening!",

Well, now the new insurance company \"lost\" my continuity of care paperwork so I'm due from Round 3 on Friday. I have my driver, my plan, trying to breath and not panic or be nervous. There's a lot that it takes for me to be ready mentally for chemo and then replace myself in my kids' life for 10 days. Anyway, the doc's office is closed for the next two days. The new doc, who thankfully even took my call since we haven't met yet, is suggesting that I receive treatment without authorization on Friday (because that's Day 22 so time to start again) and risk the chance that the new insurance will cover the cost (they are not obligated). The nurse said that my treatment while FDA approved is aggressive and it's possible that the insurance won't cover the $54,000 in drugs plus cost of facility and staff. Let's see, delay treatment, maybe risk survivability or go to treatment and end up owing more money than I can even imagine? I really don't know what to do.",

While he didn't have contacts in my new health care agency he couldn't say for sure that the chemo would be covered for tomorrow. No case worker assigned. So, if they truly wrote \"urgent\" (which I doubt because person #2 said person #1 didn't do that, and did I mention that I faxed the request on the 12th but no one at the healthcare place knows where it goes so it wasn't \"received\") then the 72 hours starts Friday at 8am central time. I'm worried that waiting up to a week will effect my prognosis, but I am terrified of such a big bill and the fact that the health care system and the insurance company won't say anything close to \"well, I can see if you'd like to live another 10 years year keeping chemo on track is important so we'll cover it\" makes me too nervous to think about going on Friday. All I need is to be vomiting next week and get the call that it was denied. Here's hoping the new onco will see me tomorrow and the gal with insurance approval in the new infusion center is as good as she says she is!",

Now I know I'm supposed to think all positive thoughts and all but some days I just see that all I'm trying to do as a mom just isn't working. One kid won't even look at me because he doesn't like the way I look. I know he's not trying to be mean, just being a kid and coping. But losing the relationships with my kids that I had before cancer is more difficult than feeling nauseous. Sure everything happens for a purpose and the docs give me an 80-90% chance of being here in 5 years but days like today I just want to say yes, maybe someone can mother them better than me and maybe that person is coming soon. Today I'm not only not well physically I feel like I cannot stuff my sad feelings of my relationship with my kids and my future. There is not a soul I can say this to because that would mean that I am not fighting cancer. Sure, tomorrow I'll come out fighting and be positive but today I just want to acknowledge my feelings.
