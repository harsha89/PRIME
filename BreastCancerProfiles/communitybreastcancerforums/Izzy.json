I was nervous the first day, anxiety and all. The radiation techs and nurses were so very kind.Day 2 went better, 3 even better and 5 was good. These are quick,  I started praying before I go in and tell myself I am fine. I put on chat-stick, I bring in a bottle of water and take a few sips before I lay down. I am able to listen to my mp3 player. Even though I am in there just a few min, It keeps me in \"my zone\". This may seem like alot to some, but when I get nervous, like flying or anything, this is how I get through. I am so blessed to have such caring techs. My boob did get pink starting on the first day and starting swelling, but I was also premenstrual. The dr say really too early for most to get pink. On nurse suggested that I take 400-600 mil of Advil 3X a day. I started the advil on Fri and having the weekend off I think has helped. In my support group it was suggested that I use Gold Bond lotion with Aloe. I put this on 3X a day. The Dr Tom's deodorant, well, I think I smell by afternoon. I might try Arm & Hammer deodorant without the aluminum. Has anyone tried that? Well I have rambled on enough.  Izzy",

I was told that I would not need radio because I did not have any significant amount of breast tissue left. I did push for the MAMMA print, it came back with a \"low\" rating - meaning that I would not benefit from chemo (I did a happy dance) and I was placed on tamoxifen 20mg once a day. I took it in the morning and I felt rough all day. Very bad migraines, upset tummy, significant swelling in lower legs and arms & I wanted to sleep all day. I changed to taking it at night and now I have awful nightmares, stomach feels worse than before and I still have the migraines. MO is going to try medically shutting down my ovaries to see if I can tolerate menopause. If I do she will change my tx....Im considering not taking anything.",
