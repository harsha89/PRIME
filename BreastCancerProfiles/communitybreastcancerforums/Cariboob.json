      "Content": "Mar 22, 2011 12:03PM - edited Mar 22, 2011 12:04PM by Cariboob Hi Lammo, my heart goes out to you as last Wednesday my heart was pounding when I was having my breast ultrasound. From what I have read the ulstrasound can detect if the lump is fluid filled or not which in my case it was. My mother has had to go onto biopsy three times in her life as the ultrasound detected more of a solid lump and all 3 times hers were B9. Try not to read into too much about what the radiologist and technician said. I am sure the technician was feeling bad at the fact that you were scared and need to go one step further. Sometimes radiologists have no idea of the anxiety we are experiencing just waiting for these further tests and then when they come out with these insensitive remarks, quite frankly, it really ticks me off! Remember the stats that you most likely have a B9 bump. Try and keep busy and think positive! I know, I know, easier said than done :)",

I was told to continue with my yearly mammos and that cysts are pretty much always 99% of the time B9.  I look forward to hearing responses though to your question as the whole callback drama was very frightening and I too want to be aware of anything that I should be doing to be proactive.",

My Father died from colon cancer and my Mom just had her upper right lobe removed from lung cancer in December and we found out recently she is one of the lucky ones - Stage1A... my Mom took it all in stride - I was amazed at her strength and courage.  Now its time for me to learn from her. I am going to make that mammo appt. tomorrow. It used to be such an easy call to make... tears here just thinking of all of you - your own individual experiences. For me I do feel it is better to have a few days of anxiety and to be on top of things. I had a colonoscopy in September and had high anxiety about that too but I am glad that I did it as they found and removed two small polyps. Now I don't worry about the colon - well not for 5 years anyway.  Thanks for taking the time to share :)  you have given me the courage and I do appreciate a place to come for support.  PS: We have a small little cabin on a lake in British Columbia in the heart of the Cariboo. It's my happy place and where I got my name \"Cariboob\"",

It does sound VERY positive for you and I am sure on Wednesday morning you are going to be breathing a HUGE sigh of relief.  I know what the waiting game is like - had to go through it this time last year and now I stress about just a regular screening mammo - waiting not to get that callback.    I hope that you find some peace over the next couple of days - your wait is almost over.",

I just went for my regular screening mammo Friday and now just worried about every phone call that is coming in worrying they are calling me back. I received my very first call-back this time last year and it scared the bajeesus out of me. Further diagnostics resulted in a cyst and I was put back to regular screening. Used to do my annual mammos like nothing, just went in and did them without worry - its a whole new ball game now but in the end I am glad to be proactive about my health.  There was a lady with her husband in the waiting room awaiting a biopsy - oh my what us women have to go through in our lives.  I am surprised though at how many women I know in my life that have never had a mammo and we are all in our late 40's - early 50's. One of my friends who has two teen children just says it freaks her out too much and she says what will be will be. Its amazing what fear can do to us.  I did ask for the thyroid cover this time and was provided with it. The technician said that the mammo machiens radiate downards and no need to worry about it but I said I had read thyroid cancer was on the rise in women and I would like the cover thank you very much.  So here I am waiting for the phone to ring - wondering if I am just a bit insane now - it was just a routine mammo.  Wishing all of you lovely ladies peace during the wait!",
