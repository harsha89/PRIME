Referred me to Ortho who tried a 2nd prednisone tx which was unsuccessful.  The Ortho said he was mystified and said the prednisone should have worked.  He sent me for mri of cervical spine and I'm waiting on results.  I am a basket case thinking this may be skull mets.  I'm still in pain, the neck is stiff and have intermittent shooting pains.  Has anyone had these symptoms?  Thanks.",

Whew, what a mouthful..........anyway.........that sound you hear as you read this is a big whopping sigh of relief.  Now I just have to convince my heart doc I need to be on some kind of anti-inflammatory so this doesn't happen again.  (He had told me to stop taking it in April.)  My best wishes are with everyone who has the need to post on this board.  Pat",
