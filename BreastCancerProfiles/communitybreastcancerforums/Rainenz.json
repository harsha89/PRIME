Good luck with you tx. Hugs Raine ",

Came out of theatre to find I had had a full auxillary clearance and when my path results came in I didn't have clear margins even though my surgeon had taken extra at the time of surgery and I had 29+ nodes making me a stage 3C. Had to go back for a full Mastectomy followed by chemo and rads. In saying this you will be happy to know that I am now 6 years out from that and doing well. All the best  Raine",

I forgot to say in my last post that although I am 2 yrs out from finishing tx for my stage III bc. I have just got to 12 yrs since I was 1st dx with a stage II bc on the other side.  I have seen my sons growup and produce my 2 beautiful grandchildren.  As for stats they are only numbers and we are all different and definately not a number.",
