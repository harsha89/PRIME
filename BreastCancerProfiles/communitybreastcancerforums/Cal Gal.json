I agree, there is no hurry, and do this when you feel healed and comfortable.  I was in no hurry and I actually enjoyed being 'breast free' and or wearing the cami with forms, but the cami got hot with summer approaching and have found it difficult to wear some clothes and decided it was time to go get fitted. I went to Nordstrom and would recommend them highly. They were great-very discreet and will file all the insurance forms for me---a big plus--I did not pay anything yesterday and Nordstrom will bill my credit card after insurance is confirmed--my insurance pays 90% of the forms and bras (up to 4 bras.) ---I am grateful for that!!!! I just got off the phone with the fitter--as I love the forms but they just don't fit the bra correctly so I am going back tomorrow to try on more bras---I think this is par for the course---and just part of the process and fitting us as individuals---we are all different!!! Good luck!!!!! ",

I was too afraid of Ambien due to the 'sleep walking' things I had heard--this is just me--- I had allergies during chemo and took Benadryl--that seemed to help me-- I think it is all the steroids that they give us--- Good Luck and Good Night!!!! ",
