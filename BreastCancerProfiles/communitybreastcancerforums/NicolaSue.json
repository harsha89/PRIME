I remember reading somewhere here that you have to not worry until it's necessary to worry as energy is needed then and not this side of test results. Easier said than done however. Yes IVF worked. I have a wonderful and large family - some born naturally and some via IVF. Last baby via IVF was 2014 and then we created some beautiful embryos to have one final child but sadly we can't take the oestrogen risk (didn't know that when the embryos were created).",

I saw a few doctors and from different disciplines - oncology (obviously), gynaecology and rhumatology (can't spell that this late at night!) to help me decide what to do re hormones. In my case coming off oestrogen was not a difficult recommendation for doctors to make. In the UK the trend is very much now towards there being a 'lifetime limit' of oestrogen and because I had a LOT of IVF treatment I would have had a lot of oestrogen exposure (I'm talking 15 plus cycles and frozen embryo transfers in the main where you take months of oestrogen). So I think it was not difficult for them to recommend I came off all hormones. I didn't find it easy to come off but I didn't find it hard either. I have found that sleep is disturbed so I have to be very practical and be in bed for about ten hours so that after all the tossing and turning I might get 6ish hours of sleep. I've also had to adjust my work as I seem to get very anxious now (didn't before!) so I don't have difficult work days back to back - I'm self employed so I have to spread things out more with gaps in between. I fill the gaps with more exercise than before (boring but necessary it seems). I've also become completely unable to tolerate alcohol. One sip and I get the headache from hell. So it's difficult all in all to have thrown those hormones away but due to my IVF exposure I am convinced by the doctors telling me to have no further oestrogen so I just have to deal with the side effects. Bone loss is a possibility but I'm hoping the weight bearing exercise might offset that. What are your thoughts on things at the moment?",

With all that white (about 30% of the breast) they can't actually see the area. They don't routinely do anything other than a mammo. I'm trying not to worry/panic/eat chocolate.

I was told that I wouldn't get results immediately and that if further scanning or a biopsy was needed I would be contacted as the mammo needed to be read independently by two experts. That's fine. When I was dressing however I asked the radiographer what she was seeing. As expected she said she couldn't tell me. But then she said, come and have a look if you like. So I did. I am not a doctor and so I can't interpret what I was seeing but there was a HUGE amount of WHITE on the screen. Literally about 25% of each breast was big white areas - not small dots (as in calcification) but large bright white areas with no other colour visible in these areas.I was shocked but the radiographer wouldn't comment. I've tried googling and I'm not sure what white is.Can anyone help? I know we won't know for certain until I get a call but I would be keen to know what white COULD be. Would I be naive to hope it's just dense breast tissue....? Or, scar tissue from lump removal? LCIS diagnosed Spring 2017. Vacuum excision biopsy.

I've also had several frozen embryos and that requires that you take oestrogen for several months even after the pregnancy is established. I had my last child in 2014, via IVF. I was then due to have one final child with our frozen embryos. I had two goes with the full whammy of oestrogen and progesterone but both pregnancies ended in the first trimester. I was then due to have one final go in Feb of this year but just based on a gut instinct of things not being right I had a memmo and lobular carcimona in situ was found. I met with a professor from one of the best cancer hospitals in the UK and his feeling was that fertility drugs are definitely causal in BC but it may be a few years yet before research publishes that definitively.",
