You get used to laying there still and hearing the zaps. I remember my rad onco seeing me at my last chemo and he said rads will be \"walk in the park\"--it is a lot easier than chemo for me (and I had pretty OK time with chemo).

I guess if I didn't choose axilla then I would have two less zaps! They mentioned to me today to put cream on shoulder above collar bone....I wasn't putting cream up and over the shoulder.

I got a hair colour done (someÂ organic rinse colourÂ done at the place where I bought my wig and where they did my GI Jane cut last year)Â but now the colour is completely different--I am thinking it is the sun. Now my colour is kinda reddish weird colour. I will probably colour it again to try and get it close to my old colour. I have decided to get it cut this week--it is starting to look messy/crazy. Hoping that a little trim will help it grow into some sort of style. It will be my first haircut/trim since last May--prior to BC diagnosis.",

It is hard as it seems to be very slow coming off--so far lost 5lbs but I do feel better for the exercise. Have a long way to go to get back to where I was but it will come gradually. As long as I see some improvement in both weight and energy--I will be happy. My body is really achey---sometimes get off the couch and feel like 100 years old. I seem to suddenly have some pins/needles in my hands---which I am guessing is Neuropathy that I never had during chemo but now seem to have...great.

They had gone to Disney a few years ago but of course don't remember anything. We normally head away every year and last year missed going away due to my diagnosis--so this will be the first time away in a while. I have an appointment with my GP tomorrow to go over my concerns. I am also asking for another referral back to my surgeon (here your referral is only good for 6 months and as I haven't really seen him since my surgery--except one post-surgery appointment--I have to get another appointment)-I am considering a mastectomy. Last year they wouldn't do it--said I didn't need--but I think that it may give me some ease. I realize cancer can come back without breasts but--with having 1 and half breasts---would rather have none and feel a little more at ease. We'll see if he will do it. I am going to ask my Doc about my concerns--see what she does say. My onco won't see me till mid-July. My GP can order scans so if she thinks I need it--we will do it. Aarrrghh. Just the worry. We were at a family wedding on the weekend and had busy weekend of kids sports etc. Today, the kids were off school for the day so we took a day trip with friends. Couple more weeks left then school done and off on vacation. Will be a nice break.",

When I started working out again in March--I had a real hard time with running....I am guessing my joints had a hard time.

I will keep my fingers crossed that it is something completely NOT cancer. Our bodies have really gone through so much during treatment. I know that my Onco said that it would take 1 year to start feeling like yourself again and he was right....but I know that I am still not back to \"pre-cancer\" days but am OK with that and will work through it.

Her last CT scan did show some progression with the cancer in her lung. The previous chemo had worked on the peritoneal cancer but didn't seem to work on her lung cancer. She is starting on a new mix of two chemos and will stay on this until further notice--every two weeks with scans every couple of months. She has good spirits though. It has been almost 4 years since her initial diagnosis and 2 years since she was diagnosed stage 4 with mets. We had a great Thanksgiving spending it all together. Days like today make you realize how important family is for providing support.",

I didn't really see anything except hotel and meeting rooms--it get darks there pretty early so when I finally did feel like going for a walk--pitch black. Made it back home yesterday. Both to and from Denmark were stopovers at Heathrow in London -- had enough time to buy my UK magazines and run to the plane. Â This weekend my husband is away with my youngest son at a hockey tournament. My older son and I went wedding dress shopping with my oldest sister--she found her dress and it was so much fun watching her trying on dresses. All that watching of \"Say Yes to the Dress\" paid off! Tonight we are heading to church as my son is getting confirmed this year and he has various activities to do at church. My jet lag is kicking in a bit as I haven't really rested since getting back. Back to work on Monday too! Reading about xmas shopping...I need to get out and get it done as I am always a last-minute shopper who vows every year to start earlier. Felis--I had similar experience with my breast after my lumpectomy. I had to go to emerg one night as my breast was \"leaking\" and was so sore. Basically that had to drain fluid. I got checked for LE and that didn't seem to be the problem. They drained the breast and had me on antibiotics and it cleared up really fast. If your breast hasn't cleared up, time for the Docs to see what is happening--like Lizzie said, they may have to check it out again to ensure all is OK. Perhaps, you are taking longer to heal due to the chemo?? My chemo didn't start until about 6 weeks post surgery--not sure how long the timeframe was between surgery and chemo? Hope everyone is doing well. I know it is US thanksgiving this coming weekend--sign the Christmas is around the corner. Few friends are heading down to the US for those crazy shopping days next Friday. I have no patience for fighting crowds like that. Have a great week.",

Called the doc today and I have appointment at a clinic tomorrow morning to go through my symptoms and see what is happening. My Oncologist isn't handling this but a Nurse Practioner who handles post-chemo care. I seem to be bloating with fluid retention from my last chemo and they are going to run some tests including chest xray, ultrasound to look for any issues. It is crazy--I feel fine except for the bloating--but it is getting worse each day. Anybody else have similar issue? I was hoping that getting out and walking, exercise etc would help but it seems in the last week that the more I do--the more bloated I am becoming. Strange but supposedly is a side effect of Taxotere that can be extreme in some people--lucky me.",

Omaz--I am also getting rads along with 5 boosters. I was told from RO similar to Lisa--they boost the original surgical area to ensure area is clear. My understanding is that cancer cells can sometimes spread in surgery so they give that area a boost. For whatever reason, maybe holidays, I feel particularly emotional. I keep thinking back to last Christmas when everything seemed great and before my cancer was found.

I do wonder if there is a difference in treatment between the two countries. As a point of interest, they released a study (all over news in Canada) about cancer treatment in industrialized countries with socialized medicine and Canada ranks in the top for treatment. Not sure on the details as the news only gives soundbites of information but it studied recovery, recurrance and survival rates. US was not in study as they don't have socialized medicine.",

Therefore, she said to keep in contact and over the next few years--if anything changes with breast cancer research--I can be retested.

Like any drug--it has lots of side effects--some may not even be known yet. I don't think it is because the side effects get worse--it is probably more to do with the studies--all drugs can only be marketed for the studies etc that are done and have gone through govt/health agencyÂ approval.

You also get paid--not always 100% but from 60-100% of your regular pay. This is offered more through companies than government.

It started after radiation (my radiation/cancer was on the right breast) and I started an exercise class using those strengthening bands. I thought that it was a muscle pull and the fact thatÂ I am perhaps overcompensating for the weaker side. However, the aches haven't gone away and now extend further down my left side. The reason that I am worried and getting it checked is that I had some pain in my left side back at the beginning of the year before starting rads and my onco ran another bone scan to rule out mets. The bone scan came back clear and therefore, they were not sure what is causing the pain on that side. It is not going away. I am due to see my onco in July and was going to wait but my mind won't rest--so I will see my GP next week and see what she suggests. It is so confusing as to who I should contact--onco or GP. I am guessing my GP will ask for scan/ultrasound etc. It has just pushed me back into the worry stage again--I thought that I would be able to handle this easier--but I am worried. Everyone keeps saying it is probably nothing, maybe Tamox, maybe whatever--all I think is maybe it is cancer again. Aaargghh. Just when I thought things were getting easier. My appt is on Tues so hopefully I will know from there what the next steps are. Question: For any that have had a concern since finishing treatment--have you just gone to your GP or back to your onco or maybe the surgeon? That is where I am confused.",

He is in a group that starts games to include all kids. We are proud that he is like that and I think that it comes from the fact that he went through it.

She doesn't really want to go--she is scared to stop the palliative chemo that she does every two weeks. She thinks that if she stops--the cancer will grow faster. Palliative chemo is starting to take a toll on her so hopefully, she will agree to the break and we will all head somewhere warm. Debbie--Congrats on the running.

Our team won #1 award for the most money raised by a group of family/friends! Unfortunately, now I have a cold....great. I have a cough that won't seem to go away and is getting more flemmy (sp?) as each day passes. I will call Oncologist office and leave message tonight to let them know. I don't want to do chemo sick but I also hate the thought of a delay....my next chemo is next Friday (first Taxotere after FEC). It isÂ Thanksgiving weekend here in Canada--but my husband and youngest son will beÂ in US for hockey tournament....so just me and my oldest---hopefully some relaxing time and hopefully will get better before next Thurs blood work. p.s. Hair thing--I shaved mine and let the stubble drop out--I didn'tÂ want to close shave it--didn't want to risk a cut....!Â ",

I have my bloodwork and exam today as they will try and do my chemo tomorrow instead of Friday (prob cause Doc wants day off or something). I am hoping to stay on track but nervous to start Taxotere as I have heard so many horror stories. My Doc said not to try and listen to \"war stories\" and that everyone is so individual--but hard not to esp. when everyone seems to have a hard time. Yep--My son's bday on Friday--and his bday party on Saturday--granted it is out of the house so not a big hassle. No way that I could have that many kids at my house after chemo. ckptry--my kids were fascinated with my wig, scarfs etc---they tried them on--walked around the house--like anything with kids--they quickly lose interest!",

I am heading into my 5th chemo--my surgery was on my right side therefore, they started chemo on my left. My left veins were not very cooperative--it took almost 10 times to get the IV on the first chemo. Chemo went fine but the next couple of days, my left arm was uncomfortable. The 2nd chemo--they went back in on the left arm -- took only 1 try--however,Â  a couple of days later--the \"uncomfortable\" pain came back and sort of resonates up my left side into my armpit and left breast. Doc checked it out and didn't find anything wrong but suggested the 3rd/4th chemo would go in the right arm instead. I haven't had any issue on the right side and no indication of lymphedema--however, my left side is still bothering me. Again, they checked it last chemo---did breast exam, checked lymph nodes under armpit etc.....nothing. It is a strange sort of fullness, achy feeling (kind of like when you are breastfeeding and are too full--for those Mom's out there!). Doc said it could be vein collapse.Â They are checking it out again this week....ofÂ course, everything getsÂ you worried....arrrgghhh. If it wasn't for this, I would actually feel pretty good between chemos--even with a slight chest cold (back again--had chest xray today so those results will come tomorrow). Any insight?Â Doc will order bunch of tests this week...just really strange.Â ",

I did have some sleeping pills prescribed during chemo as I was having a horrible time sleeping but I don't want to take them anymore as I worry that I won't be able to sleep without them.

Ovarian cancer progresses without symptoms so it is great that they caught it so early. I had gone through a gynecological cancer prior to breast cancer and the if caught really early, they generally don't do any additonal treatment (they get out the cancer and then check to make sure no spread). I had stage1b cervical cancer and had the rad hyst--no additional treatments except for PAP and internal every 4 months. They scanned me more for my cervical cancer than the breast cancer (MRI's, CT scans etc)..that way they can confirm your whole abdominal area. I'm not sure that I am adding any value but know that it sounds like you have a good Doc and they are moving on it. Sending you big hugs. Just a quick note to the other conversations re: post-treatment anxiety etc. I see a counsellor who helps me talk through my fears and worry. It really does help along with breathing and meditation exercises. She also recommended a book called \"Picking up the Pieces\"--it is for post-treatment and going forward. Check it out..it is amazing to read as all the fears and worry that we write about here --are there---from other survivors. They provide some good coping skills.",

My hair is regularly dark brown and it was growing in a brownish-ash colour---it was the strangest colour. They use an organic colour that is good for post-chemo. It is a better colour but because it is this organic colour stuff--it doesn't take the same as the regular chemical colours--so she said in about 6-8 weeks, if I decide to get another colour--it will be much more vibrant. The lady said that quite a few people have hair the grows in---in a \"washed out\" colour--I guess just another chemo gift. I will get hubbie to take pic and post.",

I am a little more settled today--but still nervous. This is the first time that I have had my blood taken at GP since chemo--as normally it is taken with Oncologist--so perhaps it is off compared to \"normal\" but not off compared to post-cancer? Trying to get my head around what it could be. The one thing about Canadian Healthcare system--although good and free (well kind of)--the amount of accessibility to Doctors is not as great as US. When I hear about Docs letting patients text them etc....I have never heard of that here at all. Also, the response of Docs seems to be a bit slower. I am always interested to read about US patient/doc relationship. I figured there is no point pressing the issue with the nurse...I have my appointment next week and they were adamant that they wouldn't tell me anything over the phone and that my appt next week was sufficient.

My son's hockey season is going well. It is the first year of checking this year so there are more injuries than I would like to see. My son is pretty aggressive so he has a target on him most games. Good thing he is such a fast skater. He has spent his fair share in the penalty box so far. With the kids learning to hit--headshots and hit from behinds are big penalty minutes. We played in the US a couple of weeks ago but they didn't have any hitting in their tournament so our boys were a little lost. Does your son's team hit? Seems like in the US they only have hitting starting at a certain age. I had my blood taken yesterday and I think it was traumatic for all involved--as they couldn't get a vein no matter how hard they tried. Damn chemo. They had to take from the other arm. Next time, I need to have the pediatric vein team do my blood draw....crazy.",

Hopefully, as you get stronger after finishing chemo--the healing will speed up. Lizzie--Sorry to hear of your scares. I can only imagine how worried you were. I have been through a few scares since my diagnosis--ribs, breast and pelvic pain. After having both cervical and breast cancer, every pain would scare me--every headache would worry me. My Docs have been good with checking out the various concerns--I am guessing that they may have thought it could be something. My rib pain was the worst and I seriously Dr-Googled myself into a frenzy. I thought that I would be so much more relaxed going into followup scans--but I am not. It is always a worry and I doubt that will ever end. However, I know for me that returning to regular routines was the best thing--I am a worrier by nature so given the time to worry...... Being at work, busy kids etc is the best thing. I would say that cancer is in my mind--but more of a back seat...perhaps when I hear about someone else or someone asks me a question.

Is our system perfect? No way...but...I haven't met anyone who had to worry about paying health care bills..I have met people who had to leave their job and end up on assistance and then struggling but that would happen anywhere. I am in a state of disbelief whenever I hear about the financial costs of getting cancer...as though it isn't enough to deal with by itself. Do people wait in ER's here? For hours! Do people have a hard time finding a family GP? Yes. However, I am a perfect example of how the health care system works--had two cancer diagnosis within a few months of each other and had treatment fast and never had to worry.Â  It is snowing here...sadly, people forget how to drive in this weather. I have to take my son to his hockey game tonight as my husband has the flu but my son ran out of the house to meet his friends for some sledding....and then he needs to play a game of hockey--if only I had his energy.

Day 3--was fine all day--ate (light) but kept it all down, went for a walk last night which helped to clear my head, woke up today feeling even better. Hopefully, I am out of the worst. I am keeping close watch for mouth sores and rinsing religiously with club soda, biotene mouthwash and brushing with biotene toothpaste. I am hoping that I will avoid those. Getting hair buzzed this week and still awaiting bone scan at end of August--last thing causing me worry and concern--look forward to getting that done and over and good results. Good luck to everyone starting this week--this site (and specificially this topic) is/was a godsend to me during this. Thanks to everyone (esp Lizzie--who keeps it all flowing). Take care, Rachel",

She has advised that I wait until mid-July for my complete followup before starting scans etc. My Oncologist agrees....so that being said, I will try to get my mind off of this and move forward. My followup is mid-July. Last week was a year since I found my lump and went to the Doc. I was SURE that there was something wrong--My Husband was completely the opposite--said \"can't be cancer--you just got over cancer\". I was \"officially\" diagnosed on July 5th last year after biopsy etc--but it was 3rd week of June when they told me that they thought it was serious.

I have an appt with GP next week and will wait to hear back from onco. Originally, I was convinced it was a pulled muscle as I can feel it throughout breast/chest muscle and into armpit. Just isn't getting better. I know that this worry is never gone. Just sucks. Pre-cancer--I wouldn't think twice about a sore breast/armpit--but post-cancer---different story. Thanks for letting me vent here---Everyone here understands--feels like the best place. I think that my friends/family think I am crazy--all just say---\"its nothing\". Thanks again guys---just knowing people are reading and listening...helps calm me.",

On the other hand, hardly any money from the various product does go to the actual cancer research or support. Double edged sword. I don't want to walk around draped in pink stuff anyway and am also not looking to advertise that I had cancer. Last year, I raised $24K for the Canadian breast cancer foundation and I am doing the run again but on a much smaller scale. Instead, I have participated in fundraising for the cancer centre that provided lots of programs and support to me and my family during treatment. These are the programs that need more money. I worked in big pharma for many years and know what goes on with pharma companies and Docs and Pharmacies. Craziness. In Canada, drug companies are not allowed to advertise so it is strange when you buy a US mag and they advertise drugs to take for various ailments!",

She said she did not see anything that causes her concern--that all looks good. I get the results back of my PAP in a couple of weeks but on-site she said that nothing looked suspicious. I would be lying if I said that I was completely at ease but I do feel a little better. I had a good conversation with my Doctor regarding recurrence. She said that she believes my chances of recurrence for cervical cancer is low--not 0%--but low. She said she doesn't believe in telling anyone that they are cancer free. While I was waiting, I was astounded by the amount of people in the gyne oncology unit and to that end, the amount of people who looked very ill. It made me appreciate the fact that I am here...still kicking....and the Doctors are optimistic. March break weather here is beautiful. This is the first year that my kids have not gone to a camp during March break but stayed home by themselves and had play dates with friends. They are enjoying it...it kind of saddens me that they are getting to their pre-teen years. They are good boys. My youngest son stood up againstÂ one of his hockey coaches who wanted each kid to say why one kid wasn't playing well...my son said \"I think he is a good player and this is making him sad and I don't agreeÂ with it\". He is 10 and we are so proud. Hockey here is crazy madness...coaches and parents are crazy.Â My son was the only person not to criticize the other player. Honestly, with all theÂ media around bullying and coaches that overstep their boundaries--you would think things would be a little better. My son is leaving the team this year to headÂ to another team (Debbie...there goes my Moulson connection!).Â Â ",

Now I'm sounding like I was dressed up like a spy but.... Once I got home, I took off the wig (it was very hot--doesn't help that it was over 30 celciusÂ today) andÂ I put on some scarves that I purchased (not from China but from US) and they did feel great.

Good thing that you stood up and demanded the best care that you know you should get. Many don't. Luckily, I have had no issue with my Oncology team. My primary care nurse is amazing at getting back to me with any questions or concerns. Right at front, she said she is unable to answer calls directly but promises response within 3 hours and she certainly has lived up to that. My Oncologist, although not someone I would be friends with as he is dry and seems like no humour, is good. He answers all my questions and provides me with additional information. He is the Head of Oncology at the hospital that I am going to so he is busy and often late (my only complaint). You would THINK that Oncology (only with Pediatrics) departments would be the ONE place in the hospital where the care is top notch. Seems like you get all types no matter the place. Hoping for better luck for your coming up appointments/treatments. Take care, Rachel",

I swear I feel like I am reading too much into their faces (radiologist) and what they say. I have had a pain in my left side for a couple of weeks so of course, feel like the worst is to come (after 2 cancer diagnosis this year....can you blame me?) so I was freaked out all day yesterday and hubbie had to put up with it along with random friends and family that I called. I left some crazed, messed up message for my Oncologist Nurse to let me know ASAP on results as I was SURE they found something. So I heard today, Nurse said she tried me all night last night (of course I was on the phone going through each detail with whoever would listen). She said \"Doctor said results look OK\" and will speak more to me before my next chemo. Of course, still not 100% satisfied but that will do for now to SLIGHTLY put my mind at ease. I met someone yesterday with Stage 4 stomach cancer and if only I could get her strength and ability to live each day for the fullest---not there yet (clearly as my crazed state yesterday proved) but hope to be. Have next chemo on Sept 3rd and again on Sept 24th (Hubbie is away that weekend with my oldest son at hockey tournie so have my sister watching over me). Hope everyone is doing well.",

It is a strange feeling--really sore and exhausted--extreme fatigue. It seems like I am coming out the end of the worst--it is one week since the chemo and 3-4 days since the SE started--this seems to be in line with what the oncologist had told me to expect. In hindsight--I would have asked for a prescription of painkillers just incase--that being said, I hate taking anything more than I have to -- can't imagine what my kidney/liver are going to look like after this chemo! This stuff must do a number on them. I just keep thinking 2 more.......then 1....then......gosh, what will I do with my time then (oh yeah, spend it in radiation) ;)",

I am hoping so because I would rather not have it--from what I have heard--doesn't sound very good. Taxotere itself was bad enough.",

That being said, no indication of anything serious--he said that I probably have a chest cold that my body cannot fight at this time.

Make sure you get the ice mittens and ice booties to cover yourself during infusion--that helps your toes and fingers. I didn't notice about my eyes--but have lost most of my eyebrows and eyelashes (lovely). Seems some people have more severe reactions than I did--I met someone who had really horrible pain--mine was horrible but Tylenol 3 took the edge off. I also used some warm bags (those ones that you heat in microwave) to put on my knees etc when they were aching. My Doc said Taxotere is one of the hardest drugs--certainly he was correct. Glad to hear that you are going ahead with treatment. I was also on the \"bubble\" as to whether or not I would have chemo on Wed due to my chest cold but it looks like I am OK to go ahead as blood cultures, chest xray and blood levels all OK.",

Plus they had some misconceptions of Cdn healthcare. Hopefully I shed some light to them! For whatever reason, I came back with swollen ankle and it doesnt seem to be getting better. I dont want to see Doc now as i have my GP checkup on August 1st and my onco appts late Aug. getting ready to head back into that anxiety time. Blah.",

So that makes me and my sister getting our scans within 2 days of each other. Luckily, my birthday is end of July so at least it isn't on that day!

I would like to say that it doesnt happen in Canada but we have recently had a couple of shootings in Toronto--they appear to be more gang related but no matter--just as horrible. I just dont get how people have all these guns--how do places actually think it is OK to sell a machine gun thing. Crazy. Watching CNN last night and seeing stories of victims was just heartbreaking. Sadly, one of the parents who was in our family support group last year is in his final days. Young, active man with brain cancer and no matter the treatment--tumour would just keep growing back. Three young kids. His wife had mentioned that he is on waiting list for hospice and will probably move to hospice next week. So sad. We would all sit around just chatting while kids would all spend time together and talking to counsellor. Sad time for sure.",

In the inbetween time between scans, I don't think about cancer but during that scan period--I would be lying if I didn't think about it. Sweeney--I have had 2 bone scans--one required after my initial diagnosis and another when I had lots of hip pain and lower back pain. It is pretty easy--just laying on a bed--they inject you beforehand with something that will light up any issues (I know..I am sooo technical). An image appears on TV above as the machine works its way from your head to your toes...I got my results within 24 hours--probably they could give you them right away but Doc needs to review also. It is worrying. I am heading back for another due to ongoing hip pain and lower back pain...at my last checkup--my onco said if the pains didn't get better--they would do another. Well..it hasn't so I will be heading back for the scan. Blah. The only thing I can say is that they didn't see anything during my last scan...lack of estrogen, tamoxifen and for me my hysterectomy--causes bone pain/aches. Fingers crossed.

He had hockey the next day and was asleep in the car on the way--my son is definitely one of those kids who needs 10 hours sleep per night! My older son becomes a teenager in a couple of weeks (eeeekkk!). I am getting my blood taken tomorrow to see if my thyroid medication is working. I feel pretty good so hopefully it is working. I also joined Weight Watchers 3 weeks ago and have lost 10lbs so far. I have a lot to lose to get back to my pre-cancer weight but feel that I am on the right track. I am one of those people who need accountability and weighing in each week at WW makes me honest! I added a picture of my youngest son--at 1 years old and now at 11 years old. Still my baby :) Happy Monday! ",

It is more a hassle driving to the Hospital each day for radiation. I also hope that Cal stays around. I am not bothered by any discussions--must be the Canadian in me ;) I have found it so interesting to hear all the different lives we all lead and how we have come together all around BC.

I don't want to go anywhere--just cuddle up at home. I had my followup at my Doctor today--good news, my thyroid medication did seem to be working but they found some immune deficiency --something called B lymphocyte--they say it is nothing to be overly concerned about (First thing my Doc said is \"Don't worry--it isn't cancer\"--she knows how worried I get) but can be genetic or happen as a result of chemo. The weird thing is that I have not been sick for two years--not even a cold--and supposedly this deficiency causes more illness. Strange. Plus, it is fighting my thyroid medication and therefore, that may not have long term benefit. So......I have to go to a specialist in a month to see what is what...seriously, can there be anything else. I am guessing most of this stuff goes diagnosed if you are not a post-cancer patient, but with all the blood tests etc..I guess they will always catch something. Good times :)",

The Doc investigated my pains through regular checkups and a medieval torture investigation (!) and they do not believe that it would be cancer as my symptoms are completely not consistent. However, they do acknowledge the tenderness and slight pain that is occuring in my right groin area. I will await some results in a couple of weeks but they believe that it could be ligament damage or musclo-skeletal (whatever that means). My Doc wasn't overly concerned. Had a couple of Docs investigate and also do a check of my lymph nodes. Basically, I left the appt really sore and in pain--spent the rest of the day on the couch with some painkillers. I would not say that I am in total belief that there is nothing wrong but I feel good that it was investigated more thoroughly. Sitting in the waiting room at the Gyne Oncology unit--I started chatting to an older lady with stage 4 ovarian cancer who was in her last chemo treatments--as they are not working and therefore, she is stopping with the chemo that was causing so many issues. She was so wonderful and I was completely in awe of her strength. Before we departed ways, she touched my arm and said \"you will be fine\". I can't get her out of my mind...her conversation with me in the waiting room helped me through my day.Â  This week has been a hard week so I am looking forward to celebrating Easter with my family and having a long weekend from work. I depart for Denmark next weekend--not looking forward to heading away for a week as I feel like just staying at home but...charge forward. Happy Easter :)",

Sweeney--Have question about rads? I met my radiation oncologist today for 2nd time. Originally,Â he mentioned that I have choice of just radiating breast and then breast with lymphÂ node area. In my case--only 1 lymph node affected--there isn't really any evidence based studies on decreasing chance of recurrance rates by radiating lymph nodes but thereÂ is indication that it can reduce recurrance by 2% especially in younger women. What are you doing? Are youÂ having radiation inÂ both areas? I hadn't thought about since theÂ last time that I met him---based on my crap year--I'll take any percent decrease in recurrance but he explained that more rash area will occur there. IÂ was actually ON CHEMO while talking to him so my mind wasn't really into it--pushingÂ around my poleÂ with chemo through the clinic to meet him.....I won't start rads till right after new years. My last chemo will be November 24th and they want min 4 weeks before radiation--and he said not to start between christmas and new years--thank god for that. Will have the test, tattoos etc in mid December. Thanks to everyone for advice on cough. It is getting a lot better--probably only coughed twice yesterday.

I was hoping to get back to the gym in the next couple of weeks--but not sure how my energy level will respond. My Doc also said to go easy, after all this time--body needs to recuperate. I went from cervical cancer into rad hyst and then 3 weeks later into breast cancer--therefore, my energy levels for sex were/are pretty low. I don't like to read about the side effects of Tamoxifen and what that may add. I have a few weeks before I start Tamoxifen and start rads in Jan. I am just hoping that with time--my energy levels will come back and I'll feel a little more like my old self.Â  With regards to support groups, I joined one in my local community a few weeks ago--it ran for 8 weeks and was good--it is a little hard at first but gradually, you take from it what works. There is a group of us still getting together on less formal basis.",

Every day it is growing more. My eyebrows -- I didn't lose them all, about half of them--don't seem to be growing right now.

Have doc appointment this afternoon to check blood counts etc and meet with Oncologist--lots of questions because I'm not sure what happens next--do you have regular appointments? Do they do scans on regular basis to check for mets? I still have radiation but that is with separate doctor. Anyone else done chemo and have ideas of what to ask Medical Oncologist of what to expect post-chemo?",

My RO keeps telling me how easy it will be--clearly he hasn't done it. I have heard the \"walk in the park\" so many times that I could scream. I went back to hospital today for them to run tests on my \"bloating\". They did my bloodwork which they said was actually \"stellar\"--I have bounced back from last chemo (2 weeks ago) very well and all my levels are \"normal\" basically just like someone who hasn't even had chemo. So that was good news because if there is something serious with the bloating it would show in your kidney function numbers and liver function numbers. That being said---they checked my abdomen and they said that I am getting severe bloating which is a SE of the Taxotere--you know on the list when the writing gets small on the information--it said \"severe bloating in 6%\"--I guess that is me. They said they believe that I am at the worst and it will only get better--if it doesn't--then they will put me on diuretic and do a couple of scans to be sure--they don't want to give diuretic unless they have to because they have their own SE's that are pretty severe.

So I call RO office to ask them--they can see the results of the genetic testing but tell me Doc needs to call me. AARGGHHH. I know that if I am positive, I would choose mastectomy as the gene increases your risk or recurrance--just sucks that everyone else knows but me.

It was very interesting but I don't think that emotionally--I am at the point to read about cancer right now--it made me sad just to read the 1st chapter! However, it is supposed to be a great read on the history of cancer, medicine, government involvement and the big business around it.

As we know, waiting is the worst--when your mind starts travelling to all sorts of places. Lizzie--Strange, your story about Canadian healthcare. I haven't come across anyone who has waited for any sort of Cancer treatment. I was about 2 weeks from diagnosis to surgery and that was more because of holiday inbetween. I think that you mentioned the person was in Quebec--unless there was some weird wait time problem and that is why they went across to Maine? Strange. The main problem here is waiting times at emergency rooms--not sure what it is like in the US but it can be really bad here. I was raised in England--which has similar healthcare system and they have same problems with emergency rooms etc but they also have dual system now--we don't really have that here (private and public)--there are some private clinics sprouting up esp. for people who want MRI's etc. For example: a friend of mine wanted an MRI on her knee because it was sore but the Doc said she would wait because it was prioritized--she went to private clinic and paid (nothing was wrong ultimately). Believe me, our system is not without its problems but I'm guessing no system isn't. I will let you know how my \"healing journey\" group is--I did attend a breast cancer support group and it was good and I still keep in touch with a few people. We had one person who was really sad all the time but she stopped coming. The healing journey program is pretty popular--you can look it up on net--I'm looking forward to getting some solutions to help with waiting, worrying etc.",

I met with my onco this week just to review how I am doing on Tamoxifen so clearly they know that some people have issues with the drug or else they wouldn't request specific appt for followup!

When I asked him what could be bothering me--he just shrugged his shoulders and said--a year of surgeries, chemo and now radiation--body in flux--no estrogen can cause aches/pains. Just the gift that keeps on giving (he didn't say that but pretty much what he meant). Aarrgghh.

However, there are studies just starting in EuropeÂ and early info shows that there may be a decrease in recurrance esp if you were diagnosed at younger age (I was below 40 at diagnosis)Â -- but it is minor--I think it was either 1 or 2%. That being said, I chose to radiate the nodes. I figured that I had gone through chemo and all these radiation--I chose to do whatever it took to increase chances that this damn cancer won't come back.Â Downside to radiating node is potential Lymphedema but Doc said % is pretty low. Ultimately, you need to make decision for what you feel best and what you feel most comfortable.",

Well, no more surgery--wooo hooo. Seems he took out all \"Level 1\" nodes and no more required. I called Oncologist office and have appt with Oncologist on Monday morning and should start chemo (FEC-T) next week. I'm not sure if I am \"mentally prepared\" for this--thought I would be waiting until possibly the end of August--but at least things are moving. I have bone scan/US and genetic testing (because of 2 cancer diagnosis this year) in two weeks. I feel like I am constantly at the doctor as it is--I can only imagine once chemo starts.

Here--there are lots of programs once you start looking. Debbi--Yep, my son is playing football this summer--all in black--in the heat--should be fun. He has his first official game today and it is sunny and hot. Remember--he is used to ice hockey so this is a definite switch. My youngest is playing soccer and both still play a little hockey throughout the summer. They are both so active and competitive so they love team sports--we have stopped them a little this summer as we want to have more time for family vacation etc--which as you know, is very hard when they are on competitive teams throughout the summer as attendence is required! On scans---my onco said same thing--only scan if you have something that is bothering you. My problem is when is it something that is \"normal\" and when not. My shins are hurting but more than likely it is just my return to exercise...I wake up in the morning and it takes a bit for my legs etc to get moving--is that Tamoxifen? I don't want to have unnecessary scans etc but at the same time, I sometimes worry that an ache or pain that I am thinking is normal--maybe isn't. Granted pre-cancer--these aches and pains would be chalked up to something else--our mind instantly goes to cancer after. It is a long weekend here in Canada--the sun is shining today--we are heading out for the day and then to visit friends. Unfortunately it is supposed to rain tomorrow--go figure.

I am interested to read all about US healthcare as I really don't understand it and I have tried to figure out what is going on with the new Obamacare. The Canadian healthcare system isn't perfect at all but is a clear example of \"socialized medicine\" meaning that anyone can get care -- universal coverage based on need rather than the ability to pay. System is funded through both provincial and federal taxes. The cost of our system is about 12% of GDP (which equals about $5600 per person). Most people have other insurance through their companies that provides some additional services (dentist, chiro, private hosptial rooms, pharma plans).Â  Our Â system is also confusing but basically--everyone is able to get healthcare and the Canadian people pay for it via taxes.Â  There are waits for non-essential surgeries and scans etc. but I can only give my experience via cancer--I didn't wait at all--I had surgery and started treatment within weeks of diagnosis and never once had to worry of the cost . I hate to think that there are people in the civilized world that cannot get healthcare---that cannot walk into a Doctor and get treated. I'm not sure what tax rates are like in US--but Canadian taxes areÂ crazy--income tax, pension tax, unemployment tax, health tax, sales tax, property tax, extra taxes (gas, alcohol etc)--equates to about 40-45% tax rate for the average family. So if you ask around--people may say that our system is just really tax heavy--if you make money--you pay lots of taxes--on the flip side--if you are lower income or no income--you would get same access to healthcare as me.",

I had my appointment yesterday---my Doctor came into the room and said \"I have good news\"....which of course is better than what I had expected. Basically, she said that my blood work has shown that my thyroid has stopped working completely. She said \"good news\" as over the past year, I have struggled with being tired, gaining weight and bone aches etc. She said that my thyroid is not working at all which can cause all the effects that I have had. I'm not sure if I was jumping with joy when she told me...but the alternative could be worse. They (including my Oncologists) believe that this could have been caused by the radiation. I had radiation to my clavicle area which at the time the Rad Onco said there were some risks but the benefits outweighed the negatives. Go figure. Basically what this means is that I have to start thyroid medication right away and a strong dose because they need to try and jump start the thyroid--so I had a bunch of side effects warned to me because of the strength of the thyroid medication. I will have my blood taken every 6 weeks--and then they will adjust the medication accordingly. What a mess---seriously, cancer is the gift that keeps on giving. My Oncologist wants to go back and review the radiation shots and possibly do an ultrasound of the thyroid area. However, they are not overly concerned about anything else but concerned that my thyroid won't recover. So...good news/bad news? I still have my mammo/us/bone scan next week. So fingers crossed for that also. I feel a little relief. I also told my Doc how it was horrible waiting for this news. She said that when she got the results--she asked the nurse to call--to ensure she spoke to me and to tell me what the results were--when I wasn't home--the nurse couldn't tell my husband -- granted this doesn't explain why they didn't tell me the next day. She also said that they wouldn't give my test results until I have discussed with Doctor. I'm not sure if that is just my Doctor...anyway, wasn't too happy about that but she is good Doc (basically caught both my cancers). Thanks for all your good wishes...really helped that I could come here toÂ vent and get support. Rachel xoÂ ",

I know some people used the ice mittens etc and still had problems. It seems very individual. Just cross those chemos off the list and before you know it, it will be done. If you have any issues--talk to the Doc or the Nurse--they have lots of suggestions and recommendations also. Closer to being done :)",

Debbi--So happy you got some of your drains out and you are feeling much better. I never had drains but can imagine that it would be such an obstacle in recovery. Take your time to get your strength back. I have a friend that had qualified for the NYC marathon...had everything booked and now it is cancelled...which makes complete sense. It would be crazy for them to go ahead when there is such devastation just around the corner. There is also someone I know that lives in NY--is actually in a cancer lodge in NYC so he is close to the hospital for his treatment--all his treatment is currently cancelled but hopefully will be back up and running tomorrow. So in light that there are people whose cancer treatment is cancelled due to the hurricane and power etc, there is NO way they could justify putting on a NYC marathon. Good thing that public pressure convinced the city to make the right decision. Tex--I am sorry to hear that it was cancer in the lungs. Here's hoping the chemo will help. My MIL is undergoing treatment for colon cancer with mets to the lungs and she is taking a cocktail of chemo drugs for her lung cancer. I'm not sure what it is though. The good news is that her cocktail seems to have little SE. You really are amazing and your spirit is something that we can all learn from. Work is pretty busy but I am enjoying it. I took on a new department--so with that comes people problems and I have had to make a couple of changes but hopefully, I can build a great team. I was advised yesterday that I was picked as part of a global team to improve patient care with our company so that was great news. What that means is more travel unfortunately. I haven't travelled in a couple of years so am bit of a baby when it comes to travel...I like being at home with my family! However, it is what it is and I really want to be part of the global team. Monday, I leave for Minnesota until Thursday..then I am home until Sunday and then fly out to Denmark for a week. I will have to head to Denmark again at beginning of December and then not have to travel again until Jan to UK. I am looking forward to the project but the travel is a little daunting. My hubbie will be driving the kids here and there all that time.",

That seems to be the most \"controversial\" decision as I only had 1 node positive---there are no studies to indicate that radiating the axilla area/node area will improve my recurrance rates. However, he did say that there are some new studies out of Europe that do indicate that the younger the person is when starting rads (below 40) there is some evidence showing that radiating the node area can improve your recurrance by 1 to 2%. The challenge is that radiating the node area also increases your chance of lymphedema by 20%! Although the RO so out of those that get it, only about 5% actually have it severe. To be honest, on my radiation approval form it indicates right breast with right axillary node area--it doesn't say chest wall. Is that when they radiate the breast? If so, then Yes--I am getting that done. I only had lumpectomy--not mastectomy--therefore radiating breast is a must for me. This whole radiation thing is something new to learn! Â Yep--Next Wed==last chemo. Everyone keeps asking if we are going to celebrate--have a party. Nah, not yet. Once rads are done -- then we'll have a party but like someone else mentioned--celebration will come with time when the checkups show no cancer......",

I'm not 100% sure about it--however, in my case--the mammo isn't what found the lump--it was the US as I have dense breasts. I am more concerned about getting the US than the mammo.

I would put the powder on after my showers each day to keep skin dry. I finished my full breast radiation last week and started on boosts today. It took a little longer than expected (3 zaps from 3 different angles). I had imagined that it would just be a zap at the incision but they said that the boosts are normally via different angles at the incision site. The Jan board was great in providing advice--my RO wasn't too giving with advice unless you knew what to ask. I used a cream called Glaxal Base -- recommended by RO--just a plain cream with no additives and I kept myself covered all the time. Seems like although you may not avoid getting pinky red--you may be able to avoid peeling etc if you keep the skin hydrated. Good luck to all--rads will go by really fast!",

My RO isn't the most friendly or patient focused Doc (someone mentioned they are more scientists than Docs..I think that is my Doc). I have pretty white (British) skin so was so worried about burning however, I am only slightly pink and slightly sore. I slathered on so much cream each day that I have gone through a load of cream. I also used some cornstarch underneath my breast after I showered, to keep it dry. Compared to chemo, rads seem to be easier on your body but the back/forth to the hospital and daily visits is very tiring.

My original ultrasound showed a lump of 1.3cmX1.0cmX.08cm--this was approx. 3 weeks ago. Surgeon indicated that he does feel it is larger but could be due to biopsy inflammation. I am now scheduled for partial mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy and axillary dissection on July 19th. What a whirlwind--after I found out, Doc scheduled the surgery and I already did some pre-op. He said that he cannot be staged or graded at this point until surgery. I was curious why some people seem to have the stage/grade beforehand? Also, why some start chemo sooner? Doc indicated that chemo first is due more to larger tumours. At this point, I still feel a little in the dark. The pathology was not completely back but Doctor called in and got verbal confirmation. I am hoping in my pre-op appt next week==may shed more light. Question--does anyone find out info before surgery? Surgeon indicated that post-surgery--treatment will then be determined with possible chemo/radiation. Any thoughts/advice at this point would be appreciated--my mind is in a mess.
