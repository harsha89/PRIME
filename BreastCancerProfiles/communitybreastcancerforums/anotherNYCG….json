I lost my implant on radiated side because skin was too thin. PS is encouraging LD flap now, but I dont want such an invasive surgery and long recoup. I would be fine with small implant on that side. I am not that concerned with a 'matched pair', but I would like something, not to be concave. He is not happy with my choice, - he wants perfectly matched pair, and doesnt see why i would want to undergo 3 procedures (2 FG, and then an exchange) rather than one LD flap. I am so uncomfortable with the TE in. I so want to be done with all this!",

It looked fine to me, but with a careful eye, my PS was able to see that it was not fully healed. He tried very hard to save it, but had to remove the implant after almost 2 months to avoid the risk of infection. A few months later, I had the LD on that side, with fat grafting later on, too. I am small , and had small implants, but I cant help but wonder if an even smaller implant on the radiated side would have been able to heal completely so I could have avoided the LD, but I'll never know.

I read all the reviews that I could find, and it had the best reviews of all that I saw, so I figured it's worth a try. I chose the color that was on the model (the brown, not the blond) and made sure I could exchange or return it if I didnt like it. Considering the cost of salon visits, or even the cost of gas if I were to travel to a wig store, I decided to give it a try! Let me know if you have any more questions or if you decide to get one!",

He checked with my cardiologist who agreed to my trying minoxidol, as well as possibly switching my blood pressure med, which may be contributing to thin hair. So, in addition to minoxidol, he wants me to start twice a week red light treatments in his office. Any one else told to try that?? I am not sure if I am ready to follow through.

I, too, had to have my implant removed because my radiated skin did not fully heal. The ps did spot it before infection set in, but still had to remove it. Have you had radiation? There are several options, - I've recently read about 'tug', which is fat from thighs, i think. I did not know know of that, but I, too, was not a candidate for diep. I had LD done on that radiated side. It was my only option at the time, and although not ideal, the procedure was not as awful as I'd feared, and I am glad that I did it. (However, if you read the LD message board you will be very reluctant to have the procedure. Those are the women, for the most part, who are unhappy and did not have good experiences. I think the posters who are happy and comfortable have moved on and rarely post!) If you have not had radiation, I would think you can try again without LD? Get several opinions from drs who specialize in reconstruction!!",

Also, the 3rd infusion was postponed a couple of days so as to be monday after the wedding instead of friday before. Although I did lose my hair, I felt FINE.

She passed away a month shy of her 99th birthday. I agree with the above poster though, that tamoxifin may offer you extra protection! ",

Treatment spread over 6 months, and my treatments were usually on Thursdays. I felt well enough to go to work on Friday, and had the weekends to recoup if needed, but I didnt need to most of them time! I kept most of my hair, worked throughout, and most people never knew I was undergoing treatment while on cmf. I did, however, try to eat carefully the few days after each round, avoiding greasy or heavy foods. I hope that you, too, find it a very tolerable regime!",

I agree, that once numb, it wont matter much if 2 are biopsied, or 3. The followup will be the same, -probably an ice pack and tylenol. I was 22 and had a fibroadenoma removed surgically, but these days they dont do that. Now they just leave them alone, or as your daughter is doing, have a core biopsy. She will be FINE!!

TRY to keep your imagination from running away!! I had my first biopsy when i was 22. It was a fibroid adenoma, but I was terrified until I knew it was benign. I needed quite a few biopsies over the following decades. Almost all were benign. Breast cancer is prevalent in my family, and it did catch up with me, - but many decades later. You WILL get through this and will be OK!! ",

I was just as nervous when I was 21 (MANY years ago ) and told that I had to have a breast fibroid adenoma removed.   I waited a few weeks to see a particular doctor, but it was ok.    My surgery was done during the summer when I could take a few days off from school.    You are young and will heal quickly!  I know that any thought of surgery is scarey, but you will be fine!!
