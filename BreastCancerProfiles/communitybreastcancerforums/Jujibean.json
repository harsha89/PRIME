The last time I felt this bad emotionally was 6 yrs ago, dealing with a suicidal teen. But she is a huge success story today, so this could be too. No matter what though, the feelings are there and we have to live each minute of them. My best to you.",

I am expecting a sentinel node, but dont want to find more foci and/or in the other breast. I am lucky to have a surgeon with whom i have a good relationship... He excised a benign intraductal papilloma in the left breast when i was 43. I wonder whether papillomas are predictive of higher cancer risk? And I have dense breasts.",

But in my situation, the results just get not so good then more I find out... so my lab report is showing HER2 equivocal (2+), ER positive, and heterogenous disease... both IDC and DCIS. the IDC is intermediate grade, the DCIS is high grade with focal necrosis. No swollen lymphs. I think my dr will say it is Stage IIA. The HER2 indeterminate response bothers me a lot. two more weeks for the FISH test resutls, geez. I also have surgically treated Graves Disease, an autoimmune disorder otherwise known as overactive thyroid. There is a link between some autoimmune disorders and breast cancer, so it looks like I was a higher risk to get cancer anyway. Seeing my dr on Friday. Today was a bad day, but each day is different. I was surprised to read your surgery options... gee mastectomy. You see I start to think I am a mastectomy candidate. Oh well, so much energy expended. Coping strategy. Wish me luck on Friday. I need it.",
