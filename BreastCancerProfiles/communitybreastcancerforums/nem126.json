So at the very upper edge of \"low risk.\" Distant recurrance rate is 10% with rads and tamoxifen. What complicates things a bit is that I'm only 32. If I was older I think it would be easier to say no chemo, but I'm young and I don't know what to do. Theoretically I have a long life ahead of me... it seems like a long time for the cancer to come back. However, my onc said that I could go either way, but she thinks the side effects of chemo are worse than the potential benefit. She estimated 2% benefit. ER, PR +. Please help. Thoughts/ similar experiences GREATLY appreciated. I am getting a second opinion, but I also don't want to put off my rads too much longer while I wait. Sarah",

I went ahead and just started rads, mostly because the 2 other hospitals I tried to schedule a second opinion with couldn't get me in for another month. I didn't feel comfortable waiting that long. So, maybe not the best way to make the decision, but in the end I felt I had no choice but to just get started with rads. Hopefully it was the right decision. I'm 2 treatments into 6 1/2 weeks of rads, and then I'll be on some sort of hormone therapy for 5-10 years. Probably tamoxifen, but I've heard about younger people doing monthly shots combined with AIs as well. Not sure which is better. I worry a bit about being instantly flung into menapause at the ripe old age of 32 with the latter option. Sarah",

If it shows that it's liquid filled it's a cyst and nothing to worry about. Done. If it shows it's solid it's probably a benign fibro but it could also be cancer. I didn't feel like playing Russian roulette. That's my story. So, keep an eye on your body and don't let anyone make you feel like you're bothering them. It's your body and life. I'm glad I was persistent, even though I shouldn't have had to be. That being said, I'm part of a tiny minority. I don't want to worry you. It's rare at this age. Someone's gotta be in the 1%.

However while I have negative margins, they are also very close. I had both invasive cancer and DCIS removed. The margins for the invasive part are 2mm. Which I hear is standard. However, the margin for the DCIS part (posterior) is less than 1 mm. That worries me. Again, they are all \"clear\" but damn, less than 1 mm is microscopically close. My surgeon said she wasn't worried and doesn't want to go back in to get a wider margin. She said the reason for this is due to the location of my tumor, the margin on that edge is muscle, not breast tissue. But can't cancer spread there too? I'll be getting radiation for 6 weeks, so *in theory* that should take care of anything in question. Just wish those margins were wider. Anyone else with a similar experience? Can you ease my mind at all here? Thank you :) Diagnosed at 32. Life is weird!
