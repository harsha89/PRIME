      "Content": "Chuck wrote: Patients with intermediate-RS [Recurrence Score] tumors did not appear to have a large beneﬁt, but the uncertainty in the estimate can not exclude a clinically important beneﬁt. - Paik et al. [Journal of Clinical Oncology 24(23), 2006] My wife has a hard time deciding whether or not to have chemo. She want to reduce the risk of recurrence to minimum, but not at any cost, given the risks of chemo drugs. She took the OncoTypeDX test but the results were not conclusive. We understand the uncertainty inherent in studies upon which this test is based. We also understand that the uncertainty happens to be much higher for this intermediate risk group. Obviously, OncoTypeDX is but one of many factors that will determine chemo for my wife. What we do not understand, is the apparent disagreement of the two graphs in the report [and in the academic paper on which it is based]. Judge for yourselves: the left graph shows a net benefit, on average, from chemo; the right graph shows an average disadvantage. Yes, the confidence intervals are wide, and imply a great deal of uncertainty. But where exactly is the \"best estimate\"? Is it positive or negative? The paper states that \"The beneﬁt from chemotherapy was less clear for patients in the intermediate-risk group (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.59; 1.8% increase in absolute risk).\" This also seems to be a contradiction: if relative risk < 1, that means that patients taking chemo were better off (a smaller number of them had recurrence); then how is there an increase in absolute risk? I called up GenomicHealth, which administers this test [and charges $3500 for it!] and spoke to 4 different people there. None of them seemed to have an answer. Our med onc also could not explain this. Did anyone else here fall in this category? Could you help us understand this? Thanks! May you all be healthy and strong!!

If anyone wants to understand this better, you might want to look up Cox Model. iwishiwere, I found some info regarding locoregional/distant recurrence, and it seems you got it right. Thanks! Tender: they didn't show the separate CMF/MF data in the paper because there was no overall difference. The graphs I got match those in the paper, I just couldn't understand the apparent disagreement among themselves. I wish you all well! Chuck",

I am not a health professional, so I'm assuming that I'm the one who does not understand something in the paper. The graphs I've posted, I did not mention, were from the report mailed to us by GenomicHealth - and they're consistent with the graphs in the paper. Figure 3 of the paper shows one such apparent inconsistency: 3A suggests \"chemo better\" on average, but 3B shows a slight decrease in DRF [distance recurrence free] for chemo patients (the paper does say CMF and MF).  There were only 45 patients in this group, so statitical errors could be large. Here's what I'm thinking: the \"raw data\" showed that in this trial, intermediate group patients did not, on average, benefit from chemo. \"Low risk\" patients more certainly did not benefit from chemo, but \"high risk\" patients did. However, since it was assumed that \"chemo-benefit\" increases continuously with recurrence score, Figure 4 in the paper was drawn, to show this continuous relationship. That still does not explain, however, the apparent discrepancy I've already noted between the relative risk (which implies a benefit from chemo) and the absolute risk (which suggests the opposite). AnnNYC: Absolute benefit of chemo means how many more chemo-patients percent survived recurrence free after 10 years - and if this number is negative, more nonchemo were recurrence free. This is consistent with the Kaplan-Meier Estimates [Table 1 in the paper]. Relative risk is a ratio, i.e. the proportion of recurrence in the chemo vs the non-chemo groups. That's consistent with Fig3A, but not with table 1... Also, does anybody know whats the difference between distant recurrence and relapse? They have different percentages and graphs in this paper. Finally, I should add that my wife is 30 years old and always very healthy. She's physically active, a mother of 2 (3 and 6, both breastfed > year), and vegetarian. Her mother had bc at 42, and no recurrence since. Thank you again for your help! Chuck",

The genetic tests for BRCA mutations are pretty expensive, and not all insurers cover them. I understand you're asking what you should do? If you're asking me, I'd say, eat healthy food, exercise, don't smoke, and everything else that you can, to keep you away, if possible from risk factors. I think that's always a good strategy, whether you're [relatively] at risk or not. Unfortunately, we're all at risk. What do you think you'd do if you discovered you carried a mutation? Would you opt for prophylactic bilateral mastectomy? It's a very hard personal decision. But if you think you won't, even if you do carry a mutation - then there may be no point looking for it. Hope that helps. I wish you and your Mom well, Chuck",
