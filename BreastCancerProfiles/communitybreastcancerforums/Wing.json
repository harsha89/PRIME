Gotta go get my nuelasta this after. Next tx 2/27 @7am yuk way to early. My rbc is low hopefully I won't need a transfusion. Joined the bald club Tues eve dh and ds gave me the buzz they were trembling so bad they scared me luckily I came out with both ears and no blood shed (whew). SIS Kimberly, I'M doing a clinical for Avastin its already in use for colon, rectal and some lung cancers. Its supposed help with blood fed cancers there is a little info in the bc.org site.  It is being tried for triple neg breast cancer to help stop reoccurance since there is no preventative meds on the market for us yet after treatment is finished.  My Onc wants me to do Taxol weekly X12 after my A/C is finished since my cancer is blood fed and they not sure if there a cells floating around so she is being proactive. Thanks for asking. Carol, I'll get out a check to you, hopefully I have my shirt in time for my next tx. D1, Bio looks good I have a port also if you wanna through it in the mix. Thanks Have a nice Valantines Day all!",

(bitches!) Hope everyone's se aren't to bad today. Carol, thanks for sending out the shirt let me know when you get the check.  Vettegal, That sounds so scary I would of be freakin out and probably would have lost the dh to the floor! About the sore back I also took some of my leftover painkillers from surgery and that helped me to sleep better might help some of you sleep better too. Dana, Sorry to hear about the police officer your community lost they are out there putting it all on the line for our safety. Therese, I am doing the clinical on Avastin for triple negative there is some info on BC.org press release you can read about it there. Have a nice rest of the weekend everyone and get some rest!",

Carol, don't feel lonely here just yet I'm having infusions every Wed until the end of June and rads after so don't think I'll be going anywhere soon.  Love the weiner dog pic my sister has 3 of em they are so cute and lovable.  D1, thoughts and prayers to the bil hope the tests come out with no brain damage.

(lol) Best wishes to all having chemotini's today.  Sounds like I will be going to the bar with a big crew tommorrow best wishes to one and all in attendance and hopefully the will be no chemotini hangovers for anyone! D1, Congrats on your last tx thats great news hopefully you still be around in June when I celebrate my last tx. Julie, Great pic glad to see you could enjoy your bday cake,  good thing you wern't holding it when you \"slipped\". Therese, I understand about being nervous I am triple negative also after treatments you are one your own its strange to think all of a sudden there is nothing preventative you can take you just gotta pray you are cured. Kimberly, Welcome back from the fog we all get lost in it from time to time, the important thing is you are out of it. Dana, Best of luck on with your biopsy I'm praying its not cancerous. Deb, Hope you dp's mom isn't suffering and she is comfortable. Carol, Congats to ds on his medal sounds like you need a big old nap after this weekend!

Here's my story, I have been worried about breast cancer since the new millenium at the age of 38, because on my routine yearly mammo I was told I have very dense breast which as you all know are hard to read on mammo.  Anyway I was got the big scary call back in for my pics then sent to the breast surgeon for a biopsy which was determined to be calcifications.  The Dr. asked me to do a clinical on the new \"digital\" mammo xray system being developed which i figured would only help me as I would be monitered better so i did it for 2 years.  I then had the same repeat performance in 2005 with the same results biopsy/calsifications.  After going back on the 1x yearly mammo only 10 mos out in October 07 I found a lump in my Axilla area which I was drawn to because it was sore I waited about 1 month then went to my Breast Center thinking it was just a swollen gland nothing more.  My NP asked if I was busy this afternoon and ordered a mammo and US, while having the US the tech said \"Oh boy you definitly have something going on in there, I wonder how some people get these things and other people like me just seem to never get anything\".  It was at that point I knew I had BC.  It's funny I can still quote her after all this time.  She dosen't even know she gave me the diagnosis that day.  Anyway had biopsy in Nov and  then lumpectomy and some nodes out in Dec. found out they removed 2 cancer cells 1,IDC and 1, non invasive,  the rest is history.  I have no family history of cancer on any side of my family so this is a shock to my whole family, not to mention me.  Started chemo in Jan. and here I am glad and lucky to be part of this warm and caring group of women who truly understand and welcome anyone no matter who the are into the group with open arms.

Which I will do today since I took a snowday from work it's 1:45 and still in my jammies nursing a headcold as are some of my SIS. Paule sending thoughts and prayers to you as always. Just a funny thought we were talking at work laughing about using the phrase \"back in the day\"  kinda funning hearing it used here.  LOL and round here we called them kiss a$$! Carol good luck with the infusion I thought we were all pretty much done with s#&t just drink plenty of H2O it really does help. WVgirl good idea on letting them know the reason for our visit I was thinking the same thing. I agree with possibly moving off the site, it may also help us try to move on from BC best we can and maybe we will all just remain friends that have helped each other and been through a very difficult time together.  Just a thought.  Well suppose I should get in the shower and put on real clothes dh is due home soon and I don't want him thinking this is all I did today.
