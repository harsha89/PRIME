(I'm more computer literate than she is, but I share stuff from here with her.) Here is my original post: My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer several years ago. She did the surgery but never got to do any chemo/radiation because she lost her health insurance. Approximately 2-3 years ago, she got her health insurance back and started seeing an oncologist again only to find that she had bone mets and CLL (a form of leukemia). She started treatments (arumidex, then tamoxifen, fluvestrant then after that). Then when those didn't work, she started on chemo. First it was gemzar, then taxol. Her oncologist recently changed her to xeloda upon finding that the liver now has signs of cancer. This week she ended up in the hospital due to fluid rentention in her abdomen and they drained 4L out. Her liver is still inflammed, and she can't get passed the nausea. The Drs at the hospital said he shows signs of cirrhosis (the oncologist isn't answering our questions very well) but I know the xeloda can be hard on the liver. The hospital docs felt the chemo should be changed but her regular oncologist said no. But now the nausea is getting so bad she can't keep anything down to even try the xeloda. She has zofran, compazine, and another med she has tried and none are working. Is there something else she can try? My mom's 52 years old and I feel like I am just sitting around watching her die. She kept me out of the loop for a long time, but since it's gotten worse, I'm now actively involved in her treatment. I'm looking for any help I can get Also, are there other chemotherapies that she could try outside of the xeloda? If so, what are they? Just want to get some ideas for when I talk to her less than helpfuloncologist. Any help would be appreciated Log in to post a reply",
