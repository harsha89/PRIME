Sorry, don't know all the lingo just yet! :) I had neoadjuvant chemo so following surgery I face radiation. My hope (goal) is that I will be finished with this all by my son's second birthday in August!",

I'm feeling pretty good overall..energy comes and goes.  My left arm (underneath) feels pretty sore and numb, but that's to be expected. I am amazed that I don't feel any pain at all in the incision area (only some discomfort at the two drain sites).  I'm having some swelling under the arm, and I guess that is also to be expected.  I'm glad it's behind me. The surgeon removed 21 nodes, two of which showed cancer. He removed the 2cm tumor and all margins are clear! Hooray! I had neoadjuvant chemo and will now face radiation (and possibly more chemo). I'll know more when we meet with the oncologist Thurs. Hope you're all recovering well! Good luck to those of you facing your surgeries. I am really honestly amazed at how much easier the mastectomy was compared to my C-section in '06! :)",

Now, where can I get some cute button-down PJs? I'm thinking of going to Kohl's tomorrow. Spent the entire day scrapbooking and it really did help to take my mind of of this coming Wednesday's surgery.  Why are the nights so much harder than the days as far as anxiety goes? You girls feel that way too? Sending prayers for a quick recovery for those who've had surgery and a prayer for relaxation and peace for those who await it. ",
