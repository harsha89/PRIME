Things get so much worse!!\u201d And the worst horror stories!! I get this is bad. This has been my first surgery, first sickness, my hair was both my sons security blanket from birth, constant mild headache, constant sadness, fear, nausea... but I know it is worse for so many. My biggest issue right now is the pain from losing my hair, the constant fear and the anger (I think may be coming from the steroid I am on), also the confusion of not knowing what is going on or what is coming up .... I am a mess!! It\u2019s the holidays. I have a 4 and 10 year old, an elf to hide every night, and yet.. my favorite time of the year is being stolen by my negativity... what helped you??? I need to pray more, seems I got upset with God and stopped talking to him as much. That could be a major reason for being negative! What else helped? Please don\u2019t tell me support group, this is my support group! Thanks to all y\u2019all!!! Dx 10/23/2017, IDC, Left, Stage IIIB, Grade 3, ER-/PR- Log in to post a reply",

I am only going into my third treatment, so it is awhile before anything.. they decided to attack first with chemo. If it works.. why go through with horrible radiation and surgeries??
