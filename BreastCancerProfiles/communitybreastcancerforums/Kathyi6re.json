    "Content": "Kathyi6re wrote: Hi, I'm 48 and widowed 5 months ago today.  I just had a mammogram and ultrasound yesterday and the radiologist thought it was cancer (lump and calcification).  Received a call from my doctor this afternoon who is referring me to a surgeon but her opinion is just to remove the breast (and that's before a biopsy!). Anyway, my parents are quite old and I don't want to let them know what's going on and get them worried and with my husband gone, I just wanted a shoulder to cry on.  The surgeon can't see me until Aprl 23rd.  He hasn't seen the mammogram film yet but should I be concerned about the delay between my doctor telling me to remove the breast and the surgeons review of the film on the 23rd?  If she's that confident that my breast should be removed, is that too much time to pass?  I'm trying to keep calm and positive.  Breast cancer doesn't run in my family so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'm actually more worried about chemo than I am about losing the breast.  Do biopsy's hurt?  I'm a big baby I guess.
