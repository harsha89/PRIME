Thanks to all of you who continue to offer assurance, knowledge and compassion to every new poster.  I noticed that there are many who are first to offer support and empathy to new timers like myself even though you are diagnosed.    I am not much of poster but have scrubbed these boards so much I feel like I know you all deeply.  Your good works go farther than you can ever imagine.  TO FIRST TIMERS-REMEMBER THE 80% RULE.  And here's to more B9's.

I feel like I can't breathe, my stomach hurts and my world is standing still.  I honestly can't believe I am going thru this.  I need to get a grip and keep in the moment and stop creating my own movie.  I find myself one minute fine the next in tears, boy do I hate being so self focused. Thank you all for responding to my rant, I needed it and find this place so supportive.  Wishing all the best in the waiting period. Log in to post a reply",

I will be 44 on Sunday and since getting mammograms I seem to be the one constantly called back.   I can't stomach the fact of more biopsy's and mammograms in the future.
