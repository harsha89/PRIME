I  haven't received the BRCA back or the HER2. I was told this is a grade 3.I have a burning sensation in my right breast from all areas around the tumor including above, the nipple, in the middle of my two breasts and also under my armpit.  Two months ago, I stopeed getting my period.  I went to my obgyn and he prescribed an ultrasound.  They day before going back for my results I found my lump myself.  I swear it was not there before.  My dr gave me my results of my ovarian ultrasound indicating that I had a 4.5 cm cyst on my ovary.  This will go away and he prescribed me progesterone. Twelve days later I got my menses.  He prescribed a breast ultrasound and after al of the tests and one benign path and then a bad mri along with another four biopsies, I have breast cancer. (I had the lump before the progesterone) however post scan (2 weeks later) showed another cyst on my ovary.  Im due for my period tomorrow however i feel just like I did the last cycle.  It took me 54 days to get my period prior to my last cycle.  Im 35 and Ill be getting a lumpectomy at the end of this week. I start chemo in seven weeks and am concerned that with all of my issues of not menstruating, I will not be able to ovulate to have my eggs taken out to fertilize and freeze as embryos..  I have been regular for years -every 28 days and I have not been on birth control for ten years.  My mother took progesterone while she was pregnant with me thirty five years ago however Im told this is not the issue however Im putting this in for statistical reasons. Is there something there?  Ive heard from two drs that my ovulation and my pash/bc are not linked.  How can this be??  They are both reproductive organs.  Could you explain why the PASH and bc mix is so rare and also if you can assist and tell me if the pash is protecting my body from the cancer or is making the cancer spread.  Im not sure if Im grade 3 because of the PASH or the cancer.  Please advise, this is really concerning.  Im to be married in eight weeks and my fiance and I want(ed) to have kids straight away.  Im nervous about the chemo and about pretty much everything.  Please note that there is absolutely no history of breast cancer in my family.

I never coorelated the PASH w/ hormones before.  ... that is an interesting theory and does seem to make a lot of sense.  Let me know what your doctor says about it.  Just to be clear, did they find cancer w/ the pash or just pash when they took the tumor out?   Note that the reason why my surgeon went back in for another biopsy was because she felt that pash is usually mixed in w/ cancer (but not all the time so just check to confirm w/ the surgeon that they got everything out and its benign :).  Also, the tingling could be from the nerves regenerating at the surgery site, I had a lot of that and still do to this day.  Have you had a breast mri/mammo on both breasts?  Im sure you are fine but stay on top of your drs, as you said to me, you are your own advocate!   also, bhrt is usually paid upfront for the visits and you can reimburse to your insurance per case by case; i consider the money lost and am happy if i get it back.  get your mri and mammo first before doing any hormones.  I took the test but Im not doing anything until Im off of chemo. Hang in there, hopefully I didn't scare you too much :) Let me know how it goes!",

I  hope you don't mind if I add to this list???  My surgeons mother, who was an avid BC research scientist, unfortunately was dx with BC some time ago.  She put together a list of tips and my surgeon gave it to me today during a  port follow-up.  There are some overlaps so I won't re-add any.  I hope its ok with you that I add her thots and suggestions... Hands/Feet/Nails - Garlic Nail Developer Hardener by Nutrine Ltd, White Plains, NY (helps with nail peeling).  Harmon Udder Cream or Udderly Smooth Udder Cream (Redex Industires, Salem OH  1800-345-7339, Heel Rescue Superior Moisturizing Foot Cream by Profoot www.profootcare.com and if they peel use vaseline. Eyes - Inability to focus and to see clearly bc of constant tearing.  Dexamethasone drops, also optical ointment for skin around the eyes.  The drug irritates the skin, along w/ constant wiping of the eyes.  Skin Care- Rosemary Oil for scalp - to use with grape oil, Baby Magic/Baby Lotion, Baby Shampoo.  Face - Exuiance Day Creme - spf 15 Ulta Mouth - Sensodyne Proenamel Toothpaste, alcohol free mouthwash, Magic Mouthwas - Rx MMW ONC DIPH/Mlox/Bicarb/Lido - tastes terrible but works very well!  (this is verbatim, I have no idea if it's a mixture or a complete rx).  Triamcinolone Acetonide Dental Paste (for mouth sores).  anti nausea meds: emend - 1 hr b4 chemo, next two days in arm kytril - three days every 12 hrs adivan - sleep aid compazine - every 4-6 hrs for first 3  days after chemo, make you drowsy and constipated zofram - by day 3 to 4 switch from compazine. The rest is pretty similar to the above tips but she goes into detail about bone pain bc it appears that she had a terrible go with it.  Here are her notes for the bone pain: Take a claritin one hour before neulasta.  Take pain pills to deal with the bone pain.  I took 2 vicodin (hydrocordone/apap 5/325) every four hrs and also a half of a lorazepam 1mg).  The 1 mg was too strong, but a quarter or a half helped with the twitchyness that the dexamathasone causes (taken the first two days after chemo).  I took the lorazepam (no more than half) both on the days that I took dex and also when I was having bone pain from neulasta.  That was generally days 3-6. Her third tx the bone pain lasted the entire three weeks.  Bless her heart.  Her daughter is an AMAZING surgeon.  My first biopsy was negative but she refused to settle with the information and requested another biopsy.  She caught my cancer at an early stage yet very aggressive.  I can't say enough about these two extraordinary women and I hope you find the information useful.  peace.",

Good luck everyone, your stories are very encouraging.  I hope my info is helpful to the newbies.  I am encouraged to drink one gallon of beverage a day.  I can't do this but Im trying.  I go for round 2 of AC this wenesday and then only two more ACs.  Cheers! ",

Odd pains like I had been standing all day with knees locked.  No fun and weird that it would wait so long to appear post neulasta. I am also curious about the Vitamin D situation.  Mine was low when I was initally diagnosed.  I was 12 and normal was 35.  I have been taking 2000IUs daily and last week I was still low. My dr. rec'd another 1000IUs, so now I am taking 3000IUs and on average you need around 600-1000IUs. Sunbllock can hinder Vitamin D absorption - great.  ..also areas where there is a lot of smog lessen vitamin D intake.  feeling kinda screwed right now.  ...gotta love NJ. ",

Britta - your blog is really awesome.  I like the layout and found it pretty informative esp the night sweat part - Ive been having night sweats for about three years and wasn't sure why, and now there may be a link to cancer.  Second, Im hoping the part of the vitamin C, and the antioxidants are for post chemo skin and not during as antioxidants and c are a huge no no since they compete w/ the chemo to fight cancer cells.  Just want to clarify.   Not sure if you are going to check back but I had to put it out there to the sisters. Just read this: Chemo drugs are very drying to your body's tissues, and the drug will be going to every cell you have. Right after an infusion, drink 8 ounces of water every hour until bedtime. Avoid caffiene, as it is also drying and may cause you to feel worse. One other benefit of drinking this much water is that it will help your body to process and flush the chemo drugs out of your system sooner, so you can start to recover sooner, too.  Connie you are a huge water drinker - 1 gal a day, bless you but I can't do it dear, I try and try.  ..and lastly i feel pretty darn good right now.  no meds, neulasta shot yesterday *Carolee - this increases your white blood cells (or red, not sure) since they drop during chemo - it goes into the bone marrow to produce more cells.  sometimes you feel growing pains or worse and you get this shot 24 hrs after every Adria treatment -either by a dr or caregiver.  I call it my heroin.   ok, off to shoot my post wedding documentary since my videographer forgot to interview us seperately pre wedding -drr.  documentary and not a video bazzar, friend of a friend.  cheap + artistic = yah.  be well jayhawking jubilleed jedis to the jugonat",

LoriJo, that is hysterical.  I need to get my licence updated with my new married name but Ive been holding off bc of the chemo, etc...  lmao  I saw a commercial today for eco something (a galvanized steel water bottle) - they were saying that the breakdowns of the chemicals from plastic water bottles contaminate into the water when they sit in the car.  They used the words 'leads to breast cancer' in that commercial. Wow was all I could think; that's pretty ballsy to write.  Then I started thinking about how at the time I had a backseat full of empty water bottles and how I felt that I was being 'healthy' and not drinking the diet pepsi fountain sodas like I wanted.  So it leads me to this question: how do you feel about how you got bc?    Anyway, Im rambling tonight.  Preparing for no sleep. Im going to put the fan about two feet from my body in the hopes that the hot flash that lasts fron 4:30pm to 4:30 am will not be too bad. Im afraid to take anything hormonal so Ive been just dealing with it.

Blessed one, we are on the same regimine - Im one AC round ahead of you.  Drink lots of fluids.  I hated my tx 2 and am hoping 3 is better.  Been juicing all week in hopes it will be better.  cept have a bad back which flared up yesterday bc of nerves, am hoping the neulasta dosen't kick it into gear.  Joseybee we are also on the same regimine.  How are you doing w/ the treatments, you are one ahead of me on AC.  My nurse told me the 12 weekly taxols are better tolerated and the hospital is only 20min away.  Its a pain to get a ride weekly but Im so nervous about the taxol.  ...again, anticipating it like going for my first AC.  We ar kind of pros now aren't we?  I also like to look into the natural girls posts about alternative treatments and get an idea of what they are drinking and eating during tx - smart gals. Tara, my hair fell out day 15 and continued until I shaved it to a buzz.  It was painful to have hair coming out but more in the physical sense bc it was a short hair cut and it hurt.  Day 10 I got a cute pixie (it was past my bra) and donated to wigs for kids.  Five days later I knew it would be gone and it was.  So far I have my eye lashes and eyebrows ...and lots of leg hairs. Stay strong JJJs!",

Im allergic to muscle relaxers so ive had to deal with the pain the old fashioned way and it literally hurt to breathe.  The neulasta really kicked my butt this round and I couldn't sleep through the pain with two valium and one anti anxiety.   ..but, Im out of the woods now and am just so relieved to be done with round 3.  I still have the neck pain and the fatigue and the overall feeling of being hungover but far better than this past weekend. Anybody know what to expect w/ the eye brows and the eye lashes?  ..and if Taxol and herceptin make you lose your hair as well?  Christc, I got my period after my first treatment of AC and Im due again any day now.  Not sure what part of the chemo affects menstruation.  Ill ask my nurse when I see her next wed.

Its a committment indeed and I personally think a mix of all things above are good, but again, some ppl do/did pure vegetarian and some don't - we all have BC here. I ate broccoli every day for six months prior to dx so who knows about that....  maybe it helped so I wasn't worse off?  I would like to think so.

Im sure yours is worse tho so hang in there!  Keep us posted.  Joni 1 - how is your port doing?  I hope some info below prepares you for expectations. I just had my first tx of AC today.  The place was really nice, comfortable and they give you food and a dvd player to watch movies.   I did ok - it's still early though.   My first dose was a steroid (decadron) that lasted about 40mins - 10mg in 50ml solution.  Second was an anti nausea (emend) 115mg in 50ml of solution- about 40mins. My third (and fave) was ativan which is an anti-anxiety- 0.5mg in 50ml solution.  Felt pretty darn good.  Of course the above niceties led up to the bittersweet-frienemy, adria.  This just looks like kool aid so thats what it is to me and apparently the red color comes from coral, which probably is the onlything natural in it.  This only took ten minutes to administer 45mls of straight undiluted kool aid.  Note that when you pee for the first time, it looks like a tequila sunrise so dont be alarmed, rather, use the imagery and head to the tiki bar at the sea of cortez, which is beckoning you.  I make no apologies of being weird these days :) The third, the cytoxan I wasn't a fan of at all.  This again is about 45 mls of undiluted friendly posion and you (I) can taste it.  It was 3q thru and the sinus pain came on.  Like being outside in the cold dry air and breathing in.  This doesn't last though. All in all, I made it through.  Right now, I only have a stiff neck (from the odd placement of my body during the port surgery). And sl acid reflux - very slight. ..just overall feel like Im getting a cold or so w some achiness.  Came home to gorgeous flowers in the garden from my new mother in law and homeade chix soup.  I am so lucky. Also, met three new amazing ladies who will take jin jun (sp?) and reike with me- one who was just finishing her 3tx for uterine cancer and looks fantastic! Different meds, same war. She mentioned this catalog to me by ACS and has inexpensive hats, scarves, good turbons (not weird carmen miranda types but cute ones and also plain skull caps.  also has boob stuff, swim suits and some pretty inexpensive wigs (synthetic) even if its not your thing, could be fun to try on a different attitude every now and again - just don't bake cookies in them!  website: www.tlcdirect.org 1-800-850-9445  Im going to rock the bonnie pixie in dark brown - they take all returns too I hear.

I also get the inulin from the kefir which helps the calcium absorb in the body.  I had all of these approved by the nurse. Connie, congrats on round 2!!  Yes, more gas than normal here as well.  Same nausea.  Hair is coming out more than a typical shed.  I hope it lasts to next week since I have lunch plans.  ..also I was able to drink one gallon of water/gatorade yesterday!  I need to do it today too. I was worried that the chemo would get washed out of my system if I drank that much water but the nurse said it goes through your blood stream and then your cells, the water pushes it to all the cells and then also flushes it out of your system so it doesn't stick to the fat cells and cause havoc. snowprincess - Im sorry to hear that you are going thru this so young.  I have a friend of an acquantience who went thru (two actuallY) one at 22 and another at 28.  If you want to PM me, I have other ladies you can touch base with - me- 35 but Im still going thru it. Another friend of a friend at 32 when dx.  Now cancer free.  If you have any questions about fertility, etc, PM me.  Hang in there!  (at first I thought I read 12dx for you!) not good.  This site is awesome and encouraging, but down right real to the bones.  not a lot minced. Twinmom - yes, it is much scarier before you go and the anticipation seems endless.  Congrats on round 1!  Bethie1 - woot woot, congrats on getting through it!!!  I will take the advice on the aloe when the time comes.  Thanks for checking in and giving us some insight about the benadryl! Hang in there triple Js!!!!  :) peace",

Elizabeth - nice iwork!  Tell your daughter she is one cool chick.  ..did anybody see 'so you think you can dance' last night?  They did the bc routine again.  Anyone check out that hot calle ocho dance, too? Regarding the stomache issues, I read on a thread for AC SEs that someone took Prostonix for stomache upset and acid.  Im glad the brioschi worked though, its an oldie but goodie.  Hoping for a cure, Im so sorry that your moms onc has moved.  This really tics me off.  Where is the ethicacy or due diligence?  He didn't know two months ago that he was looking for a new location?  I don't know, it just rubs me the wrong way.  Just my thoughts, I personally feel that the care is pretty standard and that the nurses really know their stuff so perhaps setting a regimine with him before he departs and handing it to another well trained onc?  Its a hard decision for sure.  I went to four opinions and we opted for our treatment at the closest (but albeit very good facility) which was also the only differing opinion in TCH vs ACTH.  Anyway she is so lucky to have you and I would imagine that the boards are comforting to you, as I know they are for me.  Hang in there, I hope your moms strep gets cured soon. Im day three post tx AC 3 - sl sore throat.  forgot my neulasta yesterday and took it today- yeah chemo brain.  magnesium stopped working on round three bc I also forgot to take my super expensive emend.  dummy.  I took both when I realized but now the horrible neulasta ses are settling in.  I can barely walk w/ that stupid back injury.  my gf told me I make it look so easy bc I don't complain. I guess I get it out here.  Connie, gassy w/ the prilosec - check.  Sore throat, check.  constipation, check. it goes on.  heartburn, fatigue, hell pain in my legs and back.  nails look like a smoked ten cartons of moores. uck.  I ate sushi and Im not sure if I am supposed to, anybody know about this?  I pigged out.  Probably not my smartest moment, Im blaming chemo brain. I just want to add some stuff to our list.  Many of us will be going on taxol soon.  I was speaking to my onc. and he said the vitamin B complex is good to start now to help w the neuropathy to really get it into our systems.  I started two months ago so Im hoping it helps. Also, I did some research on the SE AC thread.  This is what some ladies are taking. when the time comes: glutasolve - 2x daily for neuropathy.  Atarax - the itching associated with neuropathy (hands/feet). I havent checked the two above w/ the nurse/onc but Ill let you know what they say. K you sexy Js.  I really really apologize for rambling.  I haven't been up to posting lately but reading so there was a lot to get out.  Enjoy the weekend.  My puppy is loving chasing the fireflies; its the cutest and funniest thing to watch so it looks like Ill be doing that.

Glad most are done or into the home stretch.  We've come so far ladies, can you believe it? xo",

How is her mother, has anyone heard or anything.  They both were dx around the same time-frame. Dear Kathy, I too was on the koolaid.  It all seems individual on how you will react with it.  I did ok on it. The neulasta kicked my butt but I trucked through it.  I took claritan a day before and the day after I believe and it helped a lot.  To the point that my nurses were recommending it to their patients.  I had my concern about messing with the chemo but they said it was ok.  Biotene mouthwash helped to keep away mouthsores and swish and swallow for the time I got thrush.  I chewed on ice during chemo to prevent mouthsores and I read somewhere that women were putting their hands in ice during to help with the irritations from taxol.  Not sure if that helps but it seemed to make it more manageable for me.  Im just gutted in half about Lisa.  She was our angel two years ago starting this group and now she is our angel looking over us.  I don't know what to say except I hate this fucking disease!",
