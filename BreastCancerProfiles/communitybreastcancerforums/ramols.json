Why do we put the whole world on our shoulders and feel so responsible for everything? I obsess about how my illness is affecting my kids and husband and ignore what it is doing to me. When I was first diagnosed I promised myself I'd finally put me first and take time for me - but old habits are hard to break, aren't they? I finally heard back from the oncologist's office tonight about the vaccine and was not encouraged by what I heard. They are going to call me back tomorrow after hatching a plan - but it sounds like I need to get him vaccinated asap and start my treatment before the 30 days have run out. So I'll likely be moving in with my mother-in-law for a week or so until it is safe for me to be around my son. I realize in the grand scheme of things this is not a big deal and that I should welcome the respite. But all the mommy in me can think of is that I'll be abandoning my kids at a time when they miss me already since I haven't been able to pick them up and cuddle them to pieces in three weeks. Don't know why I can't let go of that and just let this be about me and focus on healing me. Argh. Anyway - your wise words are ones I will take to heart and I'll attempt to adjust my mindset.",

But based on the advice of some friends - I started digging for information about my 2 year old son's scheduled chicken pox vaccine and if/how that will play into my schedule. Sounds like I have to stay away from him for 30 days after the vaccine if I am on chemo. Which means if he gets it tomorrow - I don't get to start chemo until September. Wondering if anyone knows anything about chemo folks being around kids with recent live vaccines. Thanks so much and good luck to you all. I plan to come back here and read this thread as I prep for the start of my chemo - so thanks in advance for the info you have all posted here.",

But if you go to buffusa.com, and look for the womens ones - there are lots of really pretty patterns. And they seem pretty easy to put on and wear. If you go to youtube and search for buffs, you'll even find a video of how one very beautiful chemo patient wears them. I think she has other videos of how she deals with her eyebrows and lashes (somewhere in the IDC 2012 sisters thread you'll find the exact link for this from websister). Good luck!",

      "Content": "Aug 3, 2014 07:49PM ramols wrote: Hi Vikingqueen - sorry to hear about the cording. I do tend to think cording can be a precursor to LE, but it can certainly also stand alone. I have had it on and off and it is a pain - literally! If you can see a professional (PT/LE) to help you work it out, that's great. But if not - you can massage it gently on your own, trying to break it up bit by bit. But be careful to massage in the right direction - same as your manual lymph drainage exercises. Massaging in the wrong direction might get you into a heap of LE trouble. Doing it in the shower is even better - I think something about the heat and the water helps. And stretches to try to pop them are a good idea too. Stand near a table and place your hand palm down on the table - with your fingers facing you and your palm out away from you (it is kind of awkward) and straighten your arm out to stretch. You can use a doorway too - place your palm on the doorframe (with fingers facing behind you) - and straighten out your arm (so your hand and arm make a 90 degree angle - for both stretches). With both of these - if your cords are big and tight - it'll hurt so take it slow. But it will stretch them out bit by bit. If they get really bad and are limiting your range of motion - go see a professional. Good luck and feel better!",
