Good news is you are young so data is in your corner.  Advice is you have to go right now and tell your mom or dad that you need to schedule an appointment with the gyno for a lump and bruising you found in your breast.  You are very smart coming here for answers and advice because you know something isn't right and just imagine how upset your parents will be if they find out later you knew this whole time.  Don't cheat yourself valuable time for silly reasons.  Your family and friends love you so do the right thing and get that appointment.  Maybe you can get an afternoon out of school.  Hey I'm still in school as an adult and I love any reason to get out :)  Wishing you all the best!",
