I usually don't eat breakfast but I guess I will have to now. I pray I don't get nauseous, I will keep up with the nausea medication they prescribe and make sure I take them even if I don't fee nauseous. Thank you for the help and advice. It means a lot. I will keep you posted on how I am doing Tuesday. God Bless and Prayers to you",

I was diagnosed on March 9, 2017 and I had a lumpectomy with the removal of 2 lymph nodes. My tissue and lymph nodes were not infected. I have a diagnosis of Invasive Ductal Carcinoma In-Situ Stage 1A, Grade 3. I am starting my first chemo on Tuesday May 30 and I will admit I am totally freaked out. I get sick from anesthesia, not very bad just vomited twice before leaving the surgery center the day of my surgery then I was fine. I am having 4 cycles, every 21 days the chemotherapy regimen I will be getting is Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide otherwise known as Taxotere and Cytoxan (TC). I have heard mixed things about these two regarding how you feel during chemo, and how sick you get after chemo. I don't mind the hair falling out, hair will grow back, I don't mind being tired, hey I love to sleep, but the nausea and vomiting I am not a fan of. Yes I know others aren't a big fan of it either, but I have heard that normally with these two especially the low dose (4 hours of chemo rather than 6 to 8 hours) you don't get that ill from it. Can anyone help to ease my mind and my fears? Please anyone. I have been depressed since about a week after my surgery and I have been on lexapro to help with it. I have also been getting into these crying stages where I just cry for no reason at all. I mean there was a cute baby on the diapers commercial last night and I cried about how cute the baby was, my girls looked at me like I needed to be locked up in a padded room.:) Does anyone have any insight they can share with me.

I have high anxieties and they go through the roof when I have nausea or vomit so bad that I can't stop and end up dehydrated. I've had someone PM me and tell me that I shouldn't do chemo that because I'm Estrogen and Progesterone positive and HER2 negative the chemo is going to hurt men more the side effects aren't worth me taking a chance on dying and not being there for my kids. So I'm terrified even more. I started acupuncture on Monday 6/5 and today I have a second acupuncture appointment. I'm hoping it helps with the side effects, especially nausea and vomiting. Any suggestions would be helpful. I'm a single mom of 2 beautiful amazing girls my oldest is 19 and my youngest is 12, I hate that they are going to have to take care of me. My chemo cocktail is Taxotyere and Cytoxan",

Try getting some ginger ale and crackers keep them with you, also ginger in green tea or just ginger root in hot water will help too. Pick up women seabands they aren't the nausea bands you wear one on each wrist.  Good luck keep us poste",

I'm doing chemo 4 rounds of taxotyere and Cytoxan then one month off and I start my hormone blockers and one month radiation . I'd say with the grade three ask for chemo if you think it will bring your reoccirance down with the grade 3. My oncologist said she's goes Moreno by the stage and grade for how likely there's I'll bet at a reoccurance in 5 years. How do you feel? Do you want to have chemo and radiation?",
