Any ex-smokers here can give me an idea of how this might affect my respiratory status? Right now it's pretty good. I quit recently, I am active and able to walk up 9 flights of stairs (that's my answer to the health club). I don't have a lot of choice, but maybe if I tell the rad. onc. how very concerned I am they'll try to protect my lung? Any advice/help/experience to share? Thanks in advance!Â  Dx 11/31/2009, DCIS, Stage 0 Log in to post a reply",
