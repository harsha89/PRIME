Had R breast cancer Sept. 2014. . Had surgery and rads and all is ok. Went for 6 month 3D mammog this week. Doc there recommended a biopsy on the Left which had 3 previous biopsies and an aspiration - all negative for cancer. I thot \" WHAT!!!! ??????\" Can't go thru all that anxiety again!!!!! Now waiting for my Doc to write the orders for a biopsy. And to complicate matters more, we just moved from NJ to Florida for retirement so I don't know any surgeons here shud I need another lumpectomy. Anyone out there have this problem??? Thanx in advance for any help.",

Fingers swelled so can't wear my wedding rings. Hand joints hurt too. Hard to open jars. Dropped a whole tray of ice cubes today. Felt like I could not grasp it. Anyone else have this? Still can't shave the armpit on the right side (lumpectomy was on the right). Feels too sensitive but also feels just plain weird like strange sensations. Can't stand the feel of the razor. Anyone else have this? On a good note, requested a biopsy a few months ago of a nodule they were watching on the GOOD side. Came back B9 thank God. Was not going to wait and watch till the next mammog in Feb. Peace of mind is priceless. Any input on my two questions above is appreciated. Be well, all.   ",
