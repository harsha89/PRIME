I too was anxious and made the major mistake of looking all that stuff up online.  I can only speak for myself...but it really isn't as bad as what I saw online.  There were two youtube clips that really settled me.  Courageismystrength and Chachingqueen.   Luckily, my PS is a perfectionist and he gave himself a pat on the back when he came into my hospital room to remove the bandages.  HAHAHAHAHA.  Even I was like D^^^^^^^^^^^MN they look good.  LOL.  Still tight and stiff at times and sleeping on my back SUCKS.  I am a stomach and side sleeper.  I can sort of kind of lay on my sides for short periods of time. Best of luck and prayers to you!!!   STOP SMOKING!!!!  I had to and it made a world of difference.",
