I had the massive chest radiation for HD and never had skin issues, I did the skin sparing BMX and have no problems at all skin wise with the TE's... I think some PS's automatically rule us out for implants b/c of the radiation but that isn't always the case.  I almost went for the TUG, but I have 3 young kids and didn't want to be away from them that long as I wouldn't do the surgury near my home.  for something that complicated I wanted to go somewhere that does them everyday.... New orleans and Charlotte have a great center that can take the normal 12 hour procedure down to 4-5 hours.  I have heard the TUG gives the most realistic results as the tissue is the most like breast tissue.  If you like your plastic surgeon stick with him/her, but feel free to get some other opinions, I went for 3 different opinions and actually cancelled the fourth one I had scheduled after my consult with PS #3 as I just knew he was the one for me.. What ever you choose they are all great options, and you can do it.  I think the 6 weeks between when I got diagnosed to my actual surgery was the hardest time, it is so hard not knowing what to do, I was so much more positive once \"the ball got rolling\" and I actually felt like I was doing something to beat this.  Take your time, at the time for me I didn't believe everyone saying that this is a slow moving disease and you have time to explore your options... I am glad now I searched around.. but at the time it was so hard and confusing.",

I almost went to Vega for PS but luckily found a PS in my area that I LOVE so it saved a lot of driving for me..  my advice is take your time finding the right plastic surgeon for you.. he is gonna be your buddy for a while :) I was so depressed when I was diagnosed... am sooooooooo much better now and doing well if I can do anything for you let me know, it helps a lot to have someone to talk to PM me anytime, I would love to chat on the phone if you are comfortable with that, I know I had a hard time talking about it for the first few weeks and email was my security blanket to get emotion out with out  crying my heart out... Lifelover .. I went to school in Philly and was always driving thru Scranton on my way home.. also went out with a total A**hole from Scranton, but that is another story... wow England is a big change huh?  I was considering the TUG, but ended up doing TE\"S.. how was the TUG recovery?  just curious.",

I worry about as little as possible until it is right on top of me:)  I was negative, but I found out more for piece of mind with my daughter (she is 5 years old) and also for the risk of ovarian cancer, but I was doing BMX either way, for me I had multifocal DCIS and lumpectomy wasn't an option without needing reconstruction anyway... and with out having radiation as a backup I was a sure thing for a single MX, but I know I would always worry my self sick about the other side.. even though  I read on here somewhere a woman who said \" if you had cancer in one arm you wouldn't cut off both arms\".. that was the only quote I ever found that had me thinking maybe not to do the BMX, (and one of the surgeons I consulted with wasn't really behind the idea..ironically that one was the so called expert at Sloan Kettering... but the other 2 I saw supported my decision), and then once I considered my reconstruction options BMX was the only option for me.  It is a very hard choice and only you will know what is right for you when you finally make it, I think it is harder having all these options and what ifs.. I felt soooo much better once I had a game plan and could get busy getting rid of the cancer.  Hope you find your answer soon.. do what feesl right for you and will give you the greatest peace.  I have not regretted my BMX one bit ( I am 5 weeks post op) but the tissue expanderas are not fun... they did get a lot better once I started getting fills, but I wouldn't want them long term.",

I spent a bout a week in the hospital and had a ton of fluid tapped off both sides that came back benign... still don't know why it happenned, just so thankful it was nothing.  Hope yours is just a chest infection  I just had my exchange surgery on the 21st... so happy with out tissue expanders, now on to nipples, but for some reason I am extremely queasy about the whole thing... even the tattoo idea is freaking me out.",

I almost passed out, for some reason makes me very queasy, I definitely want what ever one they do under general anesthesia.. I do not want to be awake for it. The implant route isn't a lot of fun either, I think tissue expanders were invented by some man who hated women... they are so weird, at least they are now at the point of being just strange and hard, at first they were so painful.  I hate the fill process, doesn't really hurt it is just so freaky and then tight for a day or 2. ",
