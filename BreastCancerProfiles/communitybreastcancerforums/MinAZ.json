And I imagine the kind of work you do might be a factor.   I can tell you the SNB area was tender for several weeks, and it had kind of a burning feeling - nerves regenerating. I could reach over my head right away, but not all gals can do that. Hopfeully some of the other gals can give you more ideas about returning to work after SNB.   MInz ",

For legs I do it on the floor but for my back and shoulders I usually use it standing up against the wall, and I kind of move up and down on it. I'm not very graceful, for sure, but it helps. The roll is quite firm and can hurt when the muscle is really tight, so I don't know if that would be a problem for lymphedema . . .  The 36\" roll was kind of unwieldy so I cut off a 12\" section that I use most of the time.
