    "Content": "PPattie wrote: Gel implants placed following my mastectomy several years ago ruptured and the surgery to repair that problem has left me with a giant seroma that just won't heal.  My surgery was more than five months ago.  I can't find anyone who has successfully treated this situation.  My surgical drains were removed and then I went to Interventional Radiology for them to place a tube under CT scan guidance.  That tube was in for several weeks then removed.  Swelling and pain...MRI showed a large seroma under the center of the implant.  Back to hospital for second IR tube placement.  I've been 'tubed' for 5 months.  They tried Betadine as a sclerosing agent and that caused my thyroid levels to skyrocket.  Next they tried Bleomycin.  So far three Bleomycin instillations have not produced good results.  Output is still close to 30 cc's a day.  I don't know where to turn or what to do.  Very, very sick of this.  Plastic surgeon does not recommend surgery to try to correct as it could recur and we'd be starting all over again.  Does anybody have any experience with this type of problem?  Any successful treatments to recommend?
