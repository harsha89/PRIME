I am awaiting results of mammoprint to meet with oncologist to recommend treatment. I start crying for no apparent reason and my husband feels helpless....he asks me what is wrong and I cannot tell him because I do not know. My arm feels like the barbie dolls clicking into 3 locations and I have difficulty sleeping because it feels as if something gets all twisted up under my arm every time i move. Anyone else having similar issues?",
