At that point they inserted a PleurX Catheter to allow the lung to be drained at home twice a week. You should ask your MO about this option. It took about six months but ultimately I experienced a spontaneous pleurodesis and the fluid dried up more or less. I still have pockets of loculated fluid but it doesn\u2019t bother me much. It\u2019s my understanding that the pleurodesis procedure is not always successful so this may be an option. It does require out patient surgery and it was a bit painful for a few days after but the relief to my breathing was fabulous. You would need to be careful in terms of possible infection but that is not difficult to overcome. But your MO may be hoping that you will get relief once the Letrozole kicks in. Hormone therapy generally ilicits a slower response but are great once things start to respond. Hope your meeting with your MO goes well and things with your lung improve quickly. Hugs.",

However, she then went on to say \"Of course, research has shown that drinking alcohol, even in small quantities, increases your risk of developing breast cancer by X% (can't remember the exact number but it was significant - and nonsense BTW)\". I responded \"Well, that ship has sailed!\" I know it's difficult for friends and family to understand the reality that we all face. I think part of it is denial and a sincere wish for us to \"get better\". And, in all fairness, they just aren't as immersed in this as we are so don't really understand the ins and outs. Over the last 16 months I have also been more like Julie, although not all the time. That throws people. My brother made a comment about my \"tenuous health\" in reference to considering selling my house to move someplace easier to look after. I just had to laugh as over the last month I have shifted three yards of mulch onto my garden, continue to work full time, etc. Nobody would guess that I have MBC.

I don't recall any back pain with the thoracentesis. Just the coughing and pain associated with the lung reinflating. I did have pain in my back when the nurses drained my lung as soon as they go to the point that the lung was nearing being empty. I would get this pain that shot up my back on the right side. It turns out that I now have a lot of adhesions laid down like septa in the pleural space at the back where the catheter was (it's out now) which is likely why the catheter stopped draining the fluid. The pleural effusion is not cause for major concern. There are several ladies on this site who have done well for years after having a PE.

I picked up a bug flying on a work related trip (typical cold symptoms) in late October. When I couldn't shake the cough I went to my GP after 3 1/2 weeks. He ordered a chest x-ray that showed some fluid accumulation in my right lung (same side as my original BC). Next was a CT scan on December 23rd which showed swollen glands in the chest and a LOT of fluid. Explained the stupid cough! A thoracentesis drained about half the fluid (1.5 litres) and the biopsy showed malignant pleural effusion. The rest is history so to speak. I did not have much pain until mid-December but attributed it to all the coughing. I was definitely getting short of breath. I had some relief (about 4 days) after the thoracentesis but the fluid has been building since then. Now I am really struggling with the SOB and have quit a bit of discomfort. I think a big part of it is gas pain as my digestive system is not working as it should. I'm trying to eat though as I have lost about 5 lbs in the last month or so. I can't wait to see my oncologist on Friday. I'm anxious to start moving forward with treatment as, thanks to the ladies here, I am sure there are many years ahead and I plan to enjoy them!

I wondered about Tamoxifen as I have already completed five years but no problem since it's been so long. He is recommending Taxol to start and a catheter to drain the fluid as I have so many symptoms. It takes awhile for the hormone therapy to kick in.

I switched from Femara to Arimidex due to side effects (the Femara made me super irritable - flew off the handle at the drop of a hat). My MO wants to start easy and then keep adding to the arsenal as we go. The fact that I was in remission for so many years is a strong indicator that I will respond well to the hormonal treatments. We chose to start with Taxol given my current disease load. I'm not surprised that it took six months to get the effusion under control Claire. From what I understand, hormone therapy is slower to kick in and so it's probably tougher to get the lung symptoms under control. We're in similar situations Cive. While I am now dreading the afternoon walk (starting to experience SOB with exertion again) my dog doesn't get it. She's less than 5 years old and needs her exercise. While friends have offered to help out, it's always a bit challenging to arrange things on the spur of the moment. I can't wait to see the surgeon next week. Hope he can get me scheduled for the catheter soon! Hansaim, I had a bit of trouble posting my treatments as some things didn't show up even though I edited them multiple times. It turned out that for some reason a few of my treatments were set as private? Not sure how that happened but once I corrected this all was well. Thanks for the advice on the treatments. I don't see my MO until after my third chemotherapy treatment (our Cancer Agency has a GP trained in oncology that supports the oncologists) at which point I am sure we will discuss hormone therapy options in more detail. I also hope to get a sense of how long he expects me to respond to the treatment. While I know he does not have a crystal ball, I have no sense of how long it typically takes for the hormone therapies to stop working. As you can imagine, with this recent diagnosis I am grappling with planning for the future. At 54, I want to keep working but also want to ensure that I am able to have some good \"work free\" years with the ability to travel, play golf and enjoy the time I have.

I currently have a PleurX catheter to drain my lung but have noticed that I am a bit short of breath now when I exert myself and the frequency of coughing is increasing again. I see my oncologist on Wednesday and suspect that he may decide to shift to something else. It does seem odd that you feel better during the time you are having treatment though... I would have thought you would see an improvement over time. Claire, did you go straight to hormone therapy? I'm thinking that rather than another chemo regime I should just go on an AI. I know it takes longer for it to kick in but I feel that I would rather save the big guns until progression (MO has suggested Xeloda if Taxol fails). Pat",

He's a sweetheart but he's been a bit vague in terms of setting expectations. When we met in January he indicated he thought I would do well for a good long time. What the heck does that mean? His notes indicated that he thought I would stay in remission longer than average given the number of years between original diagnosis and recurrence. This is why I asked about average survival today. I'm not trying to get an exact number but want to be somewhat prepared. And I have no plans to give an inch to Mr. Cancer. I am just at a place where I feel I need to make some decisions. I am not rich but am comfortable, have no dependents and so, while I enjoy work perhaps I don't need to keep doing the nine to five thing. And the problem with working is that I find my days are so full that there is little time for me. For instance, I love golf but I'm lucky if I can get out once a week. What complicates things is trying to make the right financial decisions. In an ideal world maybe I would go to part time but that negativity impacts my pension and also any sick benefits down the road if things progress. This is why I feel a bit of pressure to think this through now and make some wise decisions. Does this make sense? Thanks again for all the support. You're all amazing. Pat.",

I know it's overwhelming at first but you'll find a lot of good advice on this site. In terms of the fluid, it can take months for the lung to dry up. I assume you are referring to a PluerX catheter to drain the lung? I had one from February to July when we finally achieved a spontaneous pleurodesis with a reduction in the amount of fluid. My lung was drained twice per week with almost a litre coming off each time initially. I did not see much reduction until it finally stopped very suddenly. I do have a small amount of loculated fluid (small pockets) but it's not enough to be a problem. It takes time for the Femara/Ibrance combo to show results so you need to be patient. And keep in mind that there are many treatment options these days so this combo is not your only option. There are a lot of ladies on this site who had pleural mets who have done very well for many years. The most important thing... don't listen to Dr. Google. The information on the internet is out of date and does not reflect the current treatments. Please feel free to ask more questions - I'm sure you have many.

I had the PleurX for about 5 months and didn't find that there was much reduction in fluid from one week to the next while on an AI and Ibrance but then the lung suddenly dried up, virtually overnight. Part of the problem for me was that I was very sensitive to the draining. If the nurses drained too much my lung would be very irritated which I think caused more fluid production. Everyone is quite individual in terms of how long it takes. My body LOVES to make fluid! (I had a similar issue at original diagnosis. I didn't think I would ever stop draining from the lymph node surgery!) Hopefully Ibrance will do its stuff soon. It does take a couple of cycles. Feel free to PM me if you have more questions. Pat",

I believe that often there are no symptoms, particularly with a small effusion. I suspect the fluid in my right lung had been slowly increasing for some time. I found out I had fluid when a chest X-ray was ordered to investigate a persistent cough. I was not slightly concerned about mets. As far as I was concerned I had the same stupid virus that was making the rounds. But then the fluid kept increasing. I had 1.5 litres taken off on December 28th and yesterday they drained 3 litres off. (Not something I want to repeat anytime soon. It was quite painful for something that is likely to bring only short term relief). Like you, I'm hoping the drugs will start to do their magic.

This is the most troubling symptom for me as every morning I feel super nauseous. It seems to lesson throughout the day. I don't think it is related to the chemo as I started having problems with nausea back in December when the lung was starting to fill. I'm eating but at times it's a bit challenging. And the big tragedy is that wine tastes terrible! It will be interesting to see what the surgeon says next week. I think I was overly optimistic about how fast this would resolve itself.

I had a new nurse who had not done many of these drains so one of the other nurses came with her (the one that tried to kill me by continuing to let the suction run after the lung was dry - I had several days of discomfort as a result). The new nurse ran the suction so fast that the catheter sucked up against my chest wall (I think) which caused a bleed. They stopped at 950 ml but I still had lots of days of discomfort as a result of the hickey on my chest wall. The good news is that it was only 850 ml on Monday but that was only 2 1/2 days. This time I am sure it was dry. It's interesting. I'm not sure if I am more sensitive than others but as soon as bubbles start to show up in the catheter I find I have a sensation that runs up my chest. I think it's from the vacuum effect but I have some issues with deep breathing and coughing for about an hour afterwards if we shut off the suction at that point. If they let it go on it takes days to feel normal. I had my third round of chemo yesterday. Generally feeling pretty well, although slightly punchy from lack of sleep (suspect the steroids). I am looking forward to finishing up chemo so that I can move on to the Arimidex. I meet with my oncologist in two weeks so will discuss the plan at that point in addition to probing a little more deeply into expected prognosis. He indicated \"I would do well for a good long time\" but that is a tad vague. I know he will be guessing but it would be helpful to know if we are talking 5 good years, 10 good years, etc. Glad you were able to resolve the treatment question. What made you decide to include Ibrance? I'm curious as this is another question I have for my MO. He has indicated Arimidex first and then Faslodex. I would like to know if Ibrance is likely to be in the cards given the very positive outcomes reported. Given my age I would like to get as many \"good years\" as possible before they have to start throwing the heavy stuff at me. That's when the whole quality of life debate comes into play.

Not my choice but I agreed to it, starting back at 80%. It's not like I am not working at all! According to our policies, I have short term leave (STIIP) for up to 6 months and need 15 days of continuous work without STIIP (or vacation) in order to reset the clock. However, the insurer is indicating that \"There are significant impacts if you don't apply: we will not have a diagnosis of my original claim, and without a diagnosis, a review of future absences for possible payment cannot be made. Therefore, you will not be entitled to receive any STIIP or LTD benefits for absences due to illness or injury for any medical reason until you have a full return to work for a continuous period of six months or more.\" WTF? I'm trying to get in touch with the back to work specialist as this makes no sense to me. Given that I have no desire to go on LTD at this precise moment, particularly now that I am on Arimidex with zero side effects beyond some edema, I am not thrilled with the idea of having my specialist or GP attempt to process this form (and BTW... it costs me to have them fill it out). So, one more issue to resolve. My plan is to return to full time as soon as possible as it will simplify things but, as you know, there are no guarantees in how we will do from one moment to the next as we switch from treatment to treatment. Hopefully I will tolerate Ibrance well if I get to take it but... I find it so challenging navigating the system at times. It seems that there is always a black and white approach to everything but MBC is not like having your tonsils out. We learn pretty quickly to roll with the punches but the system doesn't roll with us. And the funny thing is, I would likely be better off financially if I go on LTD. I can see why folks say to heck with it and just take the LTD. Sorry for the little rant. Hope you all have a great Easter weekend.",

The logical part of my brain gets that I have only had two rounds of chemo and it takes time but the crazy person in my brain is getting a bit panicky. I thought things were going in the right direction but last Thursday they drained more than 800 millilitres after only three days and Monday they stopped at 950 millilitres. They have been draining me Mondays and Thursdays but I had to move it to tomorrow this week. We'll see how much I have then but I have noticed I am a bit more short of breath on my walks again at times. Oh, and I'm coughing more again. It just feels like the BC is picking up the pace (again, the crazy person talking). My MO wants to use the fluid to determine if I am responding to the Taxol. I will see him in about three weeks after my third chemo infusion so it will be interesting to see what he decides to do. He did mention switching to another chemo regime but I wonder if we shouldn't just move to Arimidex. So many of you just went on hormone therapy. To be honest, I'm a bit freaked out about moving through the chemo arsenal so early in my Stage IV diagnosis. I so want to get to some semblance of normality which is difficult when I'm dealing with this stupid lung. It makes me feel like I have a terminal disease... I can't believe your MO behaved that way. Was it just an off day for him? Before you make the move maybe you can try to discuss this again, asking why he feels that this is the best course of action at this time. Do you get copies of your reports? That might explain his thinking. I know it seems that the Faslodex/Ibrance combo is quickly becoming the gold standard in the States. Here not yet. My MO (in his notes) suggested chemo then hormone therapy (Arimidex and then Faslodex). I intend to ask him about Ibrance when I see him and also question if he feels there is any advantage to starting with the Arimidex. It's so challenging to know what's best as they all have their preferred treatment pathway and it seems the advice changes constantly depending on new discoveries and the source. It does feel like such a crap shoot at times. Hope you can get your relationship with your MO back on track. Pat",

And I don't imagine that he managed to dislodge the catheter (although he tried hard). I'll know in an hour when the nurse arrives to drain me. Thankfully I just had chemo on Tuesday so my blood is still good. Definitely looking to have the surgeon take out the catheter when the time comes. The GP is not coming near it again! I am many years out from my original diagnosis so Arimidex is still an option. I finished all treatment in 2010, five years of Tamoxifen following chemo and then three years of an AI. I was on Femara for almost a year and then switched to Arimidex. The Femara made me soooo bitchy. It was like perpetual PMS. No fun for anyone! I can be kind of cranky at the best of times but that was very much over the top. They don't seem to do tumor markers here so I don't have that to rely on. I do have complete faith in my MO so feel that I am in good hands and that I will do well on the hormone treatments once I get there. Walkies with Sadie are going well. It's great to be able to breath again. I do find I don't have as much energy as I would like still which cuts down on the play time a bit. She has these silly games she wants me to play, chasing with a ball, playing tug, etc. All require some exertion and endurance which is in somewhat short supply with the abuse being heaped on my body (chemo and lung tortures). At least spring seems to be arriving in Victoria finally and the days are getting longer so the walks are a bit more fun. Thanks for checking on me.

I am interested in your comment about the pain and discomfort in your ribs. I was having discomfort late last year but it eased when I switched to Faslodex. Unfortunately the relief only lasted a few months and now it's worse than ever which, combined with increased hip pain, makes me think that I am progressing as well. I don't have a solid tumor in my chest - I have pleural and bone mets, making it a bit tricky to monitor. They've trying to assess the thickness of the pleura. Given the discomfort (which definitely feels like a muscle thing at times) I wondered if there could be increased mets on my ribs but they did not flag anything on the CT from a month (however, primary purpose of that CT was to assess probable pneumonia). Bone scans seem to be a complete waste of time for me with my sclerotic mets. I don't really have a question for you but it was helpful as what you described seems very similar.

I was supposed to have stitches out on March 2nd but the home care nurses never felt comfortable doing this with less than optimal light at my home. The problem was the surgeon tied the stitch quite tight around the catheter. Ultimately the decided I should have my GP take it out. They gave me a sterile kit, bandages, etc. and sent me to my doc. I couldn't really say why but this whole situation made me very nervous. I needed to be. Despite the fact that I told the receptionist what needed to be done when I made the appointment and also told my GP about the stitch that needed to come out but nurses were afraid they would nick the catheter he misunderstood what was to be done. He was running behind schedule and I guess in a hurry as a result so didn't listen. I gave him the kit but indicated they did not provide sterile gloves. No problem he had some but didn't use them when he ripped the bandage off, letting the catheter drop onto the highly unsterile exam table. He did thankfully look for sterile scissors but pretty much had the kit spread all over the place. At this point I think I was having palpitations. He clipped the stitch but then kept tugging and pulling while I said \"ow\" over and over. Finally he asked if it was attached anywhere else as he could not get it out. Ahhh. He was trying to remove the catheter! Thank god it is stitched in under my skin! He then proceeded to soak me in alcohol instead of using the swabs provided, was going to put a tiny bandage (clear sticky one - can't remember the name at the moment), instead of the big one, over top of the catheter instead of putting a gauze pad over it. So, tonight I can stress, hoping that he didn't do any damage to the catheter. If he has, I will need to go through all this again and who knows how long it will be until I can get that scheduled. At least home care is due tomorrow so I won't have to wait long. Are we having fun yet",

It a good idea as she is already a bit on the lazy and stubborn side with some things. I swear she is part mule. But her energy is definitely picking up which means I need to get rid of this fluid! SOB is much better except occasionally when I exert myself. The fluid is not really dropping, anywhere from 700 to 900 millilitres at each draw. Still twice per week. If it appears that is not going to do it I may need to talk to the surgeon. So far I am comfortable with home care doing the drain although I could likely do it blindfolded at this point. One issue is the cost of the supplies which I suspect I would have to cover if I did this on my own. Thanks all. Pat BTW. I hate autocorrect. I swear people will think I am illiterate.

I was diagnosed with a right PE in December which also turned out to be metastasis after almost 16 years. Like you, I had a lot of fluid with almost three litres drained on more than one occasion. Ultimately they inserted a PleurX Catheter which allowed homecare to drain my lung twice a week. The fluid eventually reduced and I have been without the catheter since July. I suspect the shortness of breath is from the lung infection at this point. In my case, while I had coughing and lung irritation after the thoracentesis, I did have relief from the SOB afterwards. However, the chest cavity quickly filled up again leading to increasing SOB so the relief was short lived. With regular draining I had much less SOB. While I did not recognize it at the time, in July I had an infection. Icouldn't understand why my SOB had increased while the amount of fluid had gone down. Eventually, after experiencing fever spikes, we figured out what was going on. Antibiotics took care of the infection (it took a couple of tries to find the right one) and my SOB is almost completely gone. I think there is some residual damage to my lung so I am not sure if it will go completely. I hope this is helpful. Please feel free to send me a PM if you would like to ask more questions. Pat",

My MO also uses more of a wait and see approach with scans, preferring to order scans based on our conversation at our three month check ins (or when I reach out to him if something is going on). If I have symptoms he scans. If not, he tends to leave it. At the moment I am doing well on Faslodex and when I saw him in December there was no mention of scans (last CT was the beginning of October). He also only typically orders scans of my chest, sometimes chest and abdomen, rarely my hips even though I have extensive bone mets in my hips and lumbar spine. I'm of two minds regarding his approach. The logical part of my brain understands that, unless the cancer is very aggressive, finding progression immediately likely does not change the outcome and, in fact, can do more harm than good if it leads to rapid cycling through treatments. I had evidence of bone progression shortly after being on Arimidex but my MO sat on it for a bit given that my sclerotic mets are difficult to differentiate from healing. Now that things are stable and I seem to be responding well to Faslodex I am not overly fussed about frequent scans. The other part of my brain, the panicky bit, wanted the scans on a regular basis. In my case, TMs appear to be useless (I think at their highest they were 43 while most with my burden of disease would be in the 100's) and bone scans are not much better. Recently my RO commented that my bone scan could have been hers but when they look at my CT they go 'Whoa, is this the same patient?. So really, CT has been the only way to figure out what is going but even CT is not perfect given the nature of my pleural/peritoneal mets which are difficult to follow. However, having scan timing determined by symptoms has created challenges for me. After early progression I was dealing with a number of symptoms including ongoing shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort which we attributed to the spread to the peritonium and bone pain. These symptoms resulted in frequent scans that invariably came back as stable. That was certainly good news but caused me a lot of stress, not from scanxiety, but rather from the sense that I was becoming neurotic, imagining ever twinge was cancer and costing the system a fortune. It didn't help that these scans were ordered as urgent (possibly an issue with our system in Canada). All this to say that I would have been much happier and far less stressed if scans, from neck to hip, were scheduled on a regular and predictable basis. If I have an issue I can then decide if it is warranted to consider moving the scan up. Ultimately, like everything with MBC, it seems to be highly individualistic. I don\u2019t think there is a one size fits all answer and hope that is not where that study will lead. Pat",

It does depend a lot on your treatment. I\u2019m on Faslodex so was able to plan around my injections. I do know one lady who took the Faslodex with her to New Zealand and found someone there who could do it! I have also heard other ladies say that they spoke to their MO about a break. Unless things are really running amok most MOs would be pleased to give you some time for a trip. They know how important it is for us to squeeze the life out of each day.

I don\u2019t know about the US but here it is impossible to get trip cancellation insurance for anything pre-existing. The thoughts of waving goodbye to all the money I sunk into that trip...yikes! After that experience I decided that I will focus more on spontaneous trips, things I can do at a moments notice when I\u2019m feeling well. The second challenge was a bit more impactful. Unfortunately, at the end of the trip I caught the bug that was making the rounds on the ship and bam, ended up with pneumonia. I felt god awful flying home and was flat on my back for a week. It took my five weeks to fully recover. At 56 this was unexpected. I suspect that I am susceptible with a compromised right lung which still has pockets of fluid in it. And apparently once you have had pneumonia you are at high risk of getting it again. This is a big worry for me going forward as it\u2019s just not worth it to me to be that sick after a couple of weeks of travel. Not sure how to work around this. I\u2019m sure others will chime in.

When I traveled to England last year I was able to purchase travel insurance that covered pre-existing conditions through the BC Automobile Association at a reasonable price. I would have to look back at cost and exclusions but I was very happy with it as it did not require that I be on the same treatment for several months. It would not cover huge payouts but would certainly get you patched up enough to get you home. I felt that in reality that was the best place to be if things were going sideways.

Also a couple of slightly suspicious areas on the bones in my hips. Jmanningtx, I am sure there are many things that can cause a cough. As I mentioned above, the cough is really what led us to my diagnosis. I caught a bug last October and could not shake the cough. A chest X-ray showed fluid in my right lung and the CT scan showed a lot of fluid. They did a thoracentesis in late December and found BC cells in the fluid. It doesn't sound like you have the fluid so I can't comment on your symptoms. My cough got progressively worse and, as the fluid built up, I was increasingly short of breath on exertion. Hope this helps. PM me if you gave any questions.",

Many people never experience pain from their bone mets while others can have quite a bit of pain. I have extensive bone mets and have had to have radiation a couple of times to deal with it. The first issue I had was a serious bout of sciatica caused by tumors in my lower back. I literally could not walk in the morning when I got up. Radiation caused almost instant relief from this. In January I started experiencing pain in my right hip and an ache in my groin, particularly when I was in certain positions. I wasn't sure that it was the cancer in this case (I had hip pain when I went through chemo in 2001 and the groin pain seemed more in the muscles). I delayed but over time the pain continued to worsen to the point where I was almost limping. My RO treated the hip and the pubic bone which relieved the symptoms. The challenge is that there are so many things that can cause joint/bone aches and pains. I certainly had my fair share of back issues before my stage IV diagnosis. My advice, if the bone scan did not show mets, would be to assume that it is arthritis. While it is always challenging to wrap our heads around it, the reality is that there is no survival benefit to finding metastatic cancer early (although I think it could be argued that is not the case with oligometastatic cancer) and there are risks to excessive scanning. I would also like to add that Arimidex and Tamoxifen can cause arthritic symptoms. ",

I hope folks won't mind me posting here. Yes, it is a crap shoot. I'm case in point. I was diagnosed as stage 2a in 2001. I had a 1.7 cm tumor with micromets to the sentinel node. I did have quite a bit of lymphatic and vascular invasion with my tumor. Given my age at the time (38) I threw the kitchen sink at it with six rounds of aggressive chemo, radiation (with additional rads to my clavicular nodes as part of a clinical trial), five years of Tamoxifen and then three years of an AI (originally started with Femara but it made me ultra bitchy so switched to Anastrozole). Now, almost 16 years after original diagnosis, I found out I have mets, initially with a right pleural effusion and bones. Typically this long gap leads to better outcomes, at least for the short term. My MO thought we would be able to get me back into remission fairly quickly and that I would do well for what he referred to as a \"good long time\". So far it hasn't played out that way. Three rounds of Taxol failed. Anastrozole and Ibrance failed (not clear if Ibrance failed - my blood wouldn't bounce back and my hemoglobin kept getting lower and lower). October scan showed significant progression in the bones and now it's spread to my belly (peritoneum). This cancer is doing what it wants! On Xeloda now and hoping for some success. Pat",

After almost 16 years from original diagnosis I had a cough I couldn't shake and shortness of breath. In early January I was diagnosed with malignant pleural effusion in my right lung, same type as my original BC, ER/PR+ and HER-. There may be a lesion in my right lung (nothing in the left) but it was difficult to tell as my lung was largely collapsed from the fluid. I also have sclerotic areas in my pelvic bones which could be BC but may also be due to arthritic changes. I have a PleurX Catheter in place with lung drainage twice per week. My oncologist originally started me on Taxol as he was concerned about the disease load with the fluid but it did not seem to be having an impact. Now I am on Arimidex and will be starting Ibrance soon (just received word that my health care plan will cover the cost). Feeling very positive about this treatment plan. Sending positive thoughts your way.",

I had five years on Tamoxifen and then three years of Aromatase Inhibitors (originally Femara and then switched to Anastrozole). However, before they put me on the AI they did check my estrogen levels. Now, after a diagnosis of MBC, I am back on Anastrozole again and it seems to be working. It does appear that, regardless of her hormone status, the Arimidex is not working for your sister as she has had progression. A change is in order, possibly to chemo to get the tumour load reduced. They can check her menopausal status while she is undergoing chemo, possibly considering ovary removal. Your are a wonderful brother to be advocating for your sister. I would get a copy of Bestbird's guide as suggested and use this forum frequently. There is considerable knowledge here and a group of very caring individual's. I hope you can get your sister's treatment back on track.",

I'm not familiar with the fever theory but am sure Z knows what she is talking about. Hold onto that and get yourself back to normal soon. I've been following the discussion regarding holding off to contact your healthcare team when you don't feel right and I can totally relate. At one point during my adjuvant treatment my MO gave me his home phone number as he knew I was not that keen on ER. I had two blood infections while on CEF and both times I was treated badly in the ER. The problem was, I don't present. I would go with a fever but would look okay so would then get lectured on the cancer centre sending their patients to ER. Never a good experience, particularly when your neutrophils are in the toilet and it's the worst bloody place to be! For me, there are a number of reasons I still hesitate. First, beyond BC, I have rarely been sick. I don't go to doctors much because I didn't need to go to doctors. In fact, I worked for over 8 years with my current employer with only 2 sick days. (One of them was due to the Norovirus that my stupid dog gave me. Long story...) I also hate the feeling that a) I'm crazy - imagining symptoms when things don't make sense and b) that somehow everything is related to BC. The second issue causes folks to jump into high gear whenever I have issues. That's a good thing, I know, but I feel guilty jumping the queue when it may not be urgent and may be related to other things. Makes me crazy. Going through this right now with a lung issue leading to both my MO and GP separately ordering urgent CT scans. Not sure what the issue is, I feel a bit crappy but am not incapacitated for heavens sake! But that is some sage advice from your MO Kandy. We forget sometimes how quickly things can go badly. ",

Stay strong and remember there are still lots of options. When I started my MBC treatment in February we started with chemo in an attempt to knock back my lung symptoms. Three cycles of Taxol were a big fat fail. Not only did it not reduce the cancer in my lung but there was also progression in my bones. All this to say that chemo is not always the solution and perhaps it is time to try hormone therapy again. I hope you're home soon and able to meet with your MO to come up with a plan. Hugs.",

I am on a three week cycle, unless neuropathy becomes a problem at which point I will probably go to weekly. In my case, we're trying to get those nasty cells under control before I switch to hormone therapy for what I hope is a very long time. In terms of SEs, I have had some nausea but believe that is primarily due to the pleural effusion in my right lung. The last two days I have had the aches and pains. I had to laugh as they told me I needed to let them know if I had pain in my leg. What kind of pain? My left leg was killing me! The biggest issue for me has been my bladder. I think the problem was that I did not drink enough fluid before, during or after. On Saturday I had that wonderful burning sensation and urgency. Now, it's just the urgency and I general level of discomfort in my nether region. Anyone else have this problem? I am not sure if I need to let them know at the Cancer Agency. Thanks. Pat",
