It is beautiful, very very nice. www.franceluxe.com and then look at the Good Wishes program. This program was founded by Laurie Erickson. Several woman at her office even signed the card for me. Very very nice experience! I think the reason chemo is harder than surgery is because of the day to day unknown. Will I feel good? Will I be sick? What next? At least with the surgery you want the beast out and you know surgery will take care of that! But with chemo, it's a long scary haul. I'm on day 8 of my first of six rounds of taxotere, carboplatin, and herceptin and haven't felt too bad. A little nausea, some bone pain from neulasta, a couple of days of serious chemo brain and now diarrhea but if I keep having the experience I've been having the last week, I will feel blessed!

Of course, I will not eat that too often! MamaQ, glad they finally got your cocktail right just for you! Hopefully round two will be better for you.
