NYDeb48 -  I remember that health plan that prescribed Margaritas.  It was the same years ago when my husband and I  had our fishing boat.  It seems that whenever we were at the dock or out on the boat, someone asked if we could fill their prescription for Margaritas.  Of course you can never fill it for just one person. We had a constant supply going during those summers.  Buddy - I hope you are recovering nicely.  Take care of yourself!  5timewinner - What a scare!  Glad you made it thru your tx.   Kimmom - I am also sorry to hear of your delay and am glad things went well the next day.  As with Chris, I am watching your posts because taxol #1 is next tuesday for me.  You get used to one routine and the SE's but now I'm on to the next drug and a new set of SE's.  It makes me nervous. DonnaDio - Get some rest and take care of yourself.  I hope you feel better soon!! NanaA -  Good luck with the second opinion.  Hopefully it will all work out the best for you.  It would be great if you could be done with the chemo.  It's amazing to me how many choices there are for BC treatment and how differently the oncologists are with those choices. My daughter is having her final gymnastics competition tomorrow.  It is the regional final event.  She has been practicing well all week and I am hoping she just goes out there and has fun.  I will update late tomorrow with a BRAG moment if that is okay.  I am really excited for her and hope she does well.  I am having problems with comfort with my baldness.  I can't seem to get myself to go out of the house with nothing on my head.  I also am not really comfortable with any of the hats/scarves/wig that I purchased.  I want to not care how I look to others but can't seem to get past it.  Anyone else feeling the same way?

I LOVE all the pets pics!!  My goldfish won't stay still for the camera so I am unable to send a good picture of her.  I will keep trying though.  LOL. ChrisC433 - I am also hoping that the T is better than the AC.  I hear it is just different SE's though.  I have heard that we won't feel nausea but will be more fatigued.  I think I could handle that.  I am not looking forward to one more AC but I am looking forward to being half over after the next treatment.  I hope you are doing better today! Luv2sing - This may be too late but I love the idea of the red dress, red wrap and hoop earrings.  You will knock them out!!  Happy early birthday!! (I'll probably forget by next week - chemo brain!) Janet0527 - It's amazing how much better you feel once the hair is gone, especially when it is on your terms.  I still have little spiky (metal like) hair.  I am not sure why it hasn't all fallen out.  I think I look like a baby monkey but everyone else says I look beautiful.  It's weird when I walk in from of a mirror.  I still think it's not me.  PattiB - I never really liked my hair either but I am really curious now how it will look when it grows back.  I may wish for my old style again.  I think I will have some fun with short and sassy hairstyles for a while.  Curly, straight, dark, light, only time will tell! MichelleinSJ - I don't know if I am being treated any differently but today in the grocery store I was asked if I wanted to make a donation to a cancer fund.  I was wearing a baseball hat and I took my hat off and said I've made a lot of donations in the last few months.  It was kind of nice to know I wasn't being treated any differently right then.  I'll have to pay closer attention when I go out for dinner.  Sorry to hear about your cat.  Pickle141 - Loved your jokes!!  Keep them coming!!  Laughter is the best medicine!! I am finally going to physical therapy for my ALND'd arm at the end of the month.  It has been feeling worse lately.  It feels very fatigued and I am not able to stretch it as much as I was.  I am concerned about lympodema but at the same time I know I have been overcautious with it.  Will I ever be able to do all the things I used to do with my arm/hand?  I am nervous about that.  The kids go back to school tomorrow and I am looking forward to trying to organize the house.  I am hoping to have more energy this week since it is my \"bye\" week.  You all are a great source of information and support.  Thanks for being there for me!!

I will try to keep more up to date to post specifics to everyone.  I hope everyone has a great afternoon and evening.  Here's to no or only a few SE's!! Hugs and kisses to all!1 Cyndi",

I signed up for a clinical trial (biophosperous, I think) about how the bones react and hopefully ward off future bone cancers.  I am considering another trial as well but I have to wait to see if I am still pre-menopausal.  I have not gotten my period during chemo (except for one in the beginning) but if it comes back then I will participate in that one as well). malleme - I am mid 40's and was also pre-menupausal prior to chemo.  I was told it may take 6 weeks before it comes back.  I am okay with it not coming back though.  It's one thing I don't miss.  I do know a few people who had bc at a younger age and after treatment have children. kduling - happy belated anniversary.  Mine was last Saturday (17 yrs).  We actually went out with some friends and had a grown up \"date\".  It was a lot of fun. sakura73- glad to hear taxol #1 is done.  The SE's were different for me than on AC.  Mostly bone/joint pain day 4-6.  My nails have become discolored a little but only have a couple black spots.  In fact my nails are growing more now and I actually have to cut them more often.  Not so lucky with the hair growth though.  My hands feel a little arthritic but I still do everything that is needed.  jdeking - don't mind if I enjoy the cocktail as well.  I finished chemo yesterday!! buddy1 - good luck on your last 2 tx's.  The time will go quickly and you'll be done before you know it!! Dawnmrn1 - congrats on finishing chemo.  I too start rads on July 20th.  Mine will be about 6 ½ weeks.  How long will yours be?  The rad onc said they will give me the creams if needed during radiation.  Since my port has not been bothering me too much, I think I am also going to hang on to it for awhile.  The onc nurse said they I just have to have it flushed once a month.  Mom_of_boys - wow...25 rads down already?  It seems to be going fast.  I'm glad for you that you have the end in sight!!  Please remind me how long ago you finished with chemo.  That way we can gauge how long it took for your have to be ¼ inch.  It is growing all over evenly?  I can't wait to have a least a little hair back!!  Congrats on the negative BRCA testing!! pickle141 - good luck with your move today (it is today right?)  MichelleinSJ - I'm glad to hear that things are looking a little brighter for you.  Getting back in shape is something I am hoping to do soon as well.   I know it'll help you emotional side as well as my physical side.  Now that chemo is done, I hope to get on that wagon (push it instead of ride on it LOL).  I hope things work out with your hubby.  And that your daughter is doing better. Luv2sing - I'd like to PM you about your garment sleeve.  I have one on order and should get it soon. I am sorry to all that I have missed posting to directly.  The kids schedules have me so busy I don't have much time to read and catch up.  Next week will be better.  Hubby and son go to Canada for a week of male bonding and fishing on Friday and oldest daughter goes to camp on Sunday for 2 weeks.  It'll be just me and my 7yr old for a week of mommy and daughter time.  It should be good for everyone. Sorry for the long post.  Hope everyone has a great day and those with SE's have minimal ones (me included!!) Cyndi",

Sakura - I'm glad you ex-BF went with you to your last chemo appt.  Now you can move past that faze of your treatment and leave him behind as well.  Rads are much easier and you'll be able to find someone who is also easier to be with.  You deserve the BEST!! Pickle141 - the chemo seems to have put me into menopause (prematurely) so I just started Femara (an AI).  My onc will have my hormone levels tested again in 4-6 months and see if they still show me in menopause.  My daughter is still doing gymnastics.  She practices 6 days a week for a total of 24 hours.  She still loves it!!  It will be a more difficult competition year for her because she moved up another level and the skills are much more difficult.  This will most likely be more of a learning year for her.  Thanks for remembering and asking about her!  And I love your pic!!  You look awesome.  Everyone says how much I look like my son right now.  He has a buzz cut (and he's 11).   Do I look that young????  I don't think so, but if I can, I'll get a pic posted. Anyone else taking Femara?  I am feeling achy and wanted to know if it's from the femara.  I haven't been able to do much of my new walking routine.  When I got home from walking yesterday, my legs, feet and hands were very swollen.  I am having neuropathy issues.  I read that it is at its worse 3-5 months AFTER chemo ends.   Anyone else having this issue?  Everyone says to just give it time but I am tired of everything and want it to be over with now.  Ok. I'm done complaining.  Chris - that is great that the changes can be made to your original dress.  I started going \"topless\" about a week into rads.  I was really nervous about it and thought I looked ridiculous but am glad I did it.  Now I go out all the time without anything on my head.  I feel so much freer.  I never really liked my wig.  When my 6 year old neighbor asked me what happened to my hair, I explained that I had to take some medicine that made it fall out and she looked at me and said, \"Okay,\" and that was it.  Kids are great that way.  They ask questions, then it's no big deal anymore.  I must get my kids to finish their homework and start dinner.  No rest for the weary.  And I am very tired today.  I think I'll get control of the remote tonight and just chill out!!

In 5th grade family life I learned about cancer and prayed for nobody to get it that I loved. My mom told my brother, sister, and I to sit on the couch. My dad started to tear up so I got scared. She told me she was diagnosed with breast cancer. I cried my heart out considering that my mom is one of the most important people in my life. I cried myself to sleep for about a week getting scared. The awesome friends I have helped me through this and thankfully they still are. Talking to them made me feel so much better. My mom is going through chemo and we are counting down the days! This is why I relay. I want to help and support my mom. I also want to help other people who have been diagnosed with cancer. It means so much to me that I know I am helping other people with cancer.  I know the scariest word you can hear is cancer because it's hard to go through. Please join and help fight against cancer.  Celebrate the survivors, remember the loved ones lost, and fight back against this ugly disease. Take care everyone! Cyndi",

I will keep you all updated. Chris - I was hoping to do another trial as well but since the chemo put me in menopause I was no longer eligible.  It was one for premenopausal women.  Oh well, I am happy to be on one at least.  I don't think I am having any ill effects from it either which is definitely a win! Pickle - I had a \"meltdown\" at a Rad Onc appt.  She suggested I try Lexapro (an anti-depressant) and I was not sure about it but decided to give it a try.  I was really tired for the first week or so but since then I have felt much better.  I've been taking only 1/2 a dose.  I was supposed to switch to a full dose after 2 weeks but I don't think I needed it because I am feeling much better now.  I know that if I start to feel overwhelmed again, I always have the option to increase the amount I take.  Maybe you should talk to your doc about options.

Since I had multiple tumors, there wasn't a simple way to stage me.  I have always been told that there isn't much of a difference between the two stages as far as my diagnosis and treatments were concerned.  The tumors are gone due to surgery and I think of my chemo and radiation treatments as preventative and it zapped any bad cells that may have been lurking around my body.  Beth P - I have a great group of friends that have been very supportive as well.  But...they don't really understand how I feel.  I'm always glad that whenever I have a question or concern, there is always someone here to help.  By the way, love the wig!! Christy - I am so sorry to hear about your set back.  I completely understand your frustrations with the TE.  Mine is uncomfortable and I am waiting for my surgery to get rid of it.  I am having the latisimus (sp) dorsi flap.  That is when the use the muscles/tissues from your back.  I will  have an implant as well.  I am still trying to get all the answers from my PS about the surgery and get it scheduled soon.  Francine has had this surgery and has been a great help with answering my questions.  Best of luck with your decision.  Do what you feel is best for you! No one else is home right now but someone's alarm is beeping.  Gotta love those kids... Cyndi ",

Gina - nice cocktails! The thought of a true cocktail doesn't sit right with me right now so I am enjoying yours (even though they are not specifically for me, I am just sipping a little) Marshall - I was very constipated for the first three days after treatment.  And I felt very bloated.  I took colace and senokot every day for about 5 days then I went in the other direction.  I ate a hamburger yesterday (first big meal in over a week) and it was great tasting but it didn't stay in long.  I don't know if it was all the senokot or just that my stomach can't decide which way to be.  I am hoping to find a better balance next week with round two.  Lots of water going in this girl next time.  Hang in there.  This too shall pass! Kellerka - The shower will be great.  All you need is good food, good drinks, and good friends.  That's what makes any party.  My mouth is starting to feel funny.  My cheeks and gums are definitely affected now.  I will try the magic mouthwash that was prescribed to me.  Hope everyone has a good day today!  I am having bagels and chit chat with friends today.  I will show off my new 'doo.  I will try again to post pics tonight. ",
