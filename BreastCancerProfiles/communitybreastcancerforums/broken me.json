    "Content": "broken-me wrote: I had diagnosed with breast cancer last 2 months ago and now they putting me on reservation for my chemo. My first check up they told me that it was only a fibroadenoma a changes on your hormone and its not cancerous and from that i Â was reallied on them. i few months after i found that it was growing to fast and i went for 2nd check up and by then they told me that it was a cancer. I cant believe it because i dont have a family background of cancer and im physically active in gym i eat a healthy balance of food. My question is: is it really possible for me to have a cancer? or maybe a doctor wasnt right about their findings? I already had several test. Log in to post a reply",
