Even when you haven't been told something is wrong, these women still sympathize with you and offer their very best advice. Secondly, while it's most common for women to develop breast cancer when they're in their 30's and up, it's not unlikely that a woman in her 20's can get it too. My mom's friend (although a very rare case) had breast cancer at the very young age of 16!! The  youngest I personally knew was 20. I have also read that 80% of women who have breast cancer did NOT have any family history of it. I know it's so scary when you have your own doctor so concerned when you really thought it would be nothing considering your age and health. Try to take it easy (easier said than done, I KNOW) and although it's been there 4 months, breast cancers rarely grow rapidly so it's still considered early and they will take care of it asap if that IS what it is. Good luck to you and definitely stick around here. You'll find a lot of comfort with these women.",

That scares me because I have swollen lymph nodes and my doctor checked it and told me to check it out every 6 months but I never did (my fault, I know) but could it be possible that a doctor really does feel something, doesn't worry about it at the time, and it turns out to be something later??

I'm 26 years old and I'm a mother to 4 existing children and one angel baby. I have swollen lymphnodes under my underarm but close to my left breast. I had a sonogram done on it last Summer and they said it was ok but just keep an eye on them. But on my right breast I noticed something the other day. It isn't on the breast itself, but on the areola part. I know as women we all have Montgomery bumps but this is definitely not a Montgomery bump. It's right by the n*pple, it doesn't hurt at all but it's hard. If I touch my breast or I get cold the Montgomery bumps rise up but this bump is raised all the time. It has white dots on it. I'm really not sure what it could be but before I go to the doctor I thought I might come by here and ask those who may know what it might be. Thank you for your time and God bless you all.

Push for another doctor. Push for a second and third opinion. In 2011 I was told my swollen lymph nodes under my arm was just that, swollen lymph nodes. Breast surgeon sent me for an US. He sent home a letter saying my results were \"abnormal\". He wanted me to come back so I did. He gave me a manual exam and then told me to keep an eye on it. That was it. Since then it's gotten bigger. I'll be getting a mammogram Monday for this reason AND for another lump in my other breast. More than likely it's nothing because I would assume it'd be rare to have a problem in both breasts but you just never know until you get checked thoroughly. Most likely you're right about it being a cyst but you can't be sure (and neither can the doctors) unless there's further testing to prove that. Sometimes mammograms only pick up so much and depending on our breast tissue, MRIs are the way to go. Tell them you're not comfortable with the answers you're getting and you want more testing. It's your body and you have the right. I'm sure you're fine and it's just a cyst but still. Good luck and let us know what happens.",

Did they do a manual exam beforehand? Maybe they felt something suspicious in your left breast, but even so they should still check both breasts. It took 2 months for them to give you your results? And something suspicious was found?? That's unbelievable. I would definitely see if you can get back on your parents insurance. My dad was covering me passed the age of 18. He only took me off his insurance because he thought my husband would be able to cover me but he couldn't because his jobs weren't all that great and didn't offer insurance. Definitely check to see if your dad can cover you. I'm going through the same thing with medicaid but I found a place that will do my mammogram for only $20. Check in with your local hospital and see if they offer testing without having a PCP and having to pay. Also, you asked if you should worry because you're only 21...not trying to scare you or upset anyone but yes you should still worry. I'm not saying it's going to turn out to be something serious but they tell you to start self breast exams by age 20. They want us to start earlier than usual because it's better for early detection and early treatment. I read stories of women in their 20s getting BC and my mom's friend had it at age 16! Very young, VERY RARE, but it can happen. Always be self aware of your own body and its changes. More than likely you're fine!! But it's very smart that you're so intune and you want to be checked out.",
