I have LCIS,dense breasts,multiple biopsies, atypia &family history putting me above the 20-25% risk.Private coverage RegenceBlueSheild. After a denial of my MRI I sent the required Appeal form with support letter from my oncologist. I received a letter stating the services that are not  medically necessary, including routine care are not a covered benefit. So my claim was not paid  and because it is not a covered item the $2000 (each year) doesn't even apply to my deductible. I will keep checking for ideas of how to fight them in 2010. I'm really sad to see women with BC even have trouble. I don't think anyone would have these procedures without a medical need. How dumb are they??",
