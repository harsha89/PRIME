The pain was limited (and I have very little tolerance for pain and even less for Nausea). I had saline implants as I still don't trust anything the FDA says about anything. I love my new boobs and will be starting Chemo after the holidays (Taxol and Herceptin). I was only in the hospital 2 days and they tried to kick me out the day after the surgery. I had some button down pj's but the best thing was given to my by my breast surgeon was a shirt that had pockets to hold the drains it was wonderful and I still wear it the drain pockets velcro out when the drains are removed. The manufacturer is amoena. The best. Good luck.  Judy ",

I had a bilat mastectomy my choice, and will be undergoing Taxol 12 weeks every week and Herceptin every 3 weeks rest of the year followed by Hormone pills. I am part of a study at Sloan Kettering in NY and was also told I could get by with Hormone only. Let me know thanks.",
