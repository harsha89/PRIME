Well after the mammo was done technician came and told me that doctor saw something on the pic on my right breast location 10 o'clock and wanted more pictures after more pics she didn't need any more investigation and I was send home but I couldnt let go the fact that 2 o 'clock on left breast is 10 o'clock on right what if they made a mistake tagging the pics? Because my lump is still there and I am afraid it is growing it gets really painful times but not before my period as I have been watching that. So I made an appt again with my doc and she agreed that they probably made a mistake on naming the pics and on the result said suspicious spot on right breast 10 o'clock location but because the second pictures was actually the REAL right breast didn't show anything wrong so she decided no further investigation was needed. So now because of my insuarance we have to wait one more month before she can send me for a ultrasound and this time she said she is gonna make the order clear... Well here is my question... My lump fells about an inch big and not round more like a very un even shape, and last week it seems like it grew a bit, the breast I have the lump on seems to be hanging good over an inch more than the other one and my nipple looks sensitive but it is not and larger than my other breast... And my lump is painful some ays more painful than other days but always painful only if I touch on it. So has anyone experience anything like mine? I am worried is this 1 month wait gonna cost me big in the future if this is cancer... From what I know breast cancer is not in our family. Any help would be great thank you!

Did anyone have similar lump and turn out to be cancer? I had this for over 3 months now, doesn't change with my period, some days more painful than others.... Doctor gave me antibiotics to see if it was infection and well nothing changed... It is still there still painful, for some reason I cannot let this go, I just wanted to check and see if there was anyone with similar issues and turn out to be cancer, lump is very hard like bone, when I raise my arm it sticks out more kind a pokey but nothing visual.... and does not move... And totally weird shape.... Thank you please please advice... NIH Betterwannabe, I was born to worship so are you... Log in to post a reply",

Here is what is going on with me now I have a lump on my left breast that has been there for over 4 months that I know of, it was painfull at times but not anymore. As I check it daily I noticed about a week ago that my lymph node under my arm is swollen, only on left side, I think it is eighter a new lump or a swollen lymph node. I looked online to see the location of the nodes and this seems to be right location for a lymph node and sure got very large and feels bumpy no pain. It is not swollen on the other side, so I have a ultrasound on tuesday morning, but more I feel this more I get worried about it, so should I be worried?

      "Content": "Betterwannabe wrote: Hi you all, so I went to see the BS and after he gave me an OK breast exam, it wasn't any different than what my OBGYN did, he said that the lump didn't feel suspicious and it was all up to me if I wanted to have it removed he would remove it I even got a day for the surgery on the 20th of April, but I am little worried about the surgery as he said they would put me all out and cut out the area I circle before the surgery ( he said he want to make sure he removes the right concerned area since both mammo and US negative ) so what would you do? Would you go with the removal? Or would you wait 6 months to see what happens? Did ever your BS told you it wasn't suspicious and it turn out to be BC? Thank you for all your in put...
