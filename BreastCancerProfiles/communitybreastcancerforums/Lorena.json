My drains were removed on May 12th.  I still have the staples and the area is still somewhat numb.  I can move my arm.  The pain comes and goes... I do take my pain medication at bed time.  I did take 6 cycles of chemo (TCH) before this surgery and boy am I happy to not be under that influence anymore.  I was very happy to hear the day after my surgery that the pathology report came back negative with regards to the lymph nodes removed.  Originally, my biopsy had indicated my lymph nodes were affected, but now after removal, they've tested negative.  I will be having a CT scan this upcoming Tuesday, May 19th and will be seeing my Onc on the 21st with the staples being removed on that same day.  I'm also still taking Herceptin until December 2009. Although I was very scared to have this surgery... I'm relieved to be feeling pretty good 9 days later.  I'm supposed to pick up with Radiation sometime after healing and then once that is done, I should be looking at my second surgery of \"reconstruction - DEIP\".  That surgery scares me most. Anyone out there with stapels still in place?  Currently, I do get down knowing all that I've gone through so far and wonder \"why me\"?  I plan to watch Farrah's story tonight for although sad to see it, I know I can relate to it and in it's own way, inspiring!   Hope to hear from someone here... being homebound can add to the emotional rollercoaster this takes me sometimes.",
