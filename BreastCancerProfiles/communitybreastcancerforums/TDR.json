I so wanted to hear a resounding \"let's get that thing out of there.\"  I certainly voiced my opinion -- and agreed to this biopsy as a first step.  I think she heard me, but then she said \"you are so calm\".... hmmm, a double edged sword? Would her recommendation have been any different if I had been a raving lunatic? Bottom line is regardless of biopsy results, I still may push to take it out. Thank you to those who have responded.  Anyone else have malignant results after only dense area/dense tissue seen?  I'd love to hear from you ... I'm so sorry you've all had to go thru this, but your experiences + help are truly an inspiration.  Thank you, T ",

      "Content": "TDR wrote: I first posted here about my sister's diagnosis 5 years ago.  Now I have my own situation to deal with.  The outer quadrant of my right breast has been on the radar for years ... I am now 45  ... first excisional biopsy (lump) @ age 25/benign, stereotactic biopsy (area of density) @ 40/benign, MRI @ 44/clear, at least 8 or nine mammograms/US in the last 5 years. All seemed to be ok, but there has been a 2 cm assymetric density that has been watched closely, and has been stable since 2003.  Over the years, I've had on + off pain, stinging, itching, generally weird feelings in this area, and the \"lump\" (density) is palpable.  Fast forward to mammo last week ... the area of density is progressing, now 3 cm and picked up on US, significant change since 2007, birads 4A.  After all this time, I guess it shouldn't surprise me, but in so many ways it does.  I have an appt. with a surgeon tomorrow ... just want it OUT and fully evaluated.  I am trying to be level-headed, and approaching this like any appointment.  While I want it to be NOTHING (and know it still could be!!!), I have a little voice inside me that is preparing me.  My question for all of you wonderful ladies ... Have any of you ever experienced anything similar?  Has an area of density/dense tissue ever turned out to be cancer for any of you?  My own sister had multi focal dcis hiding behind/in/around a large cyst, so I know it can be sneaky. I'm grateful that they have kept such a close eye on this, and feel like I've done everything right.  Yet I can't help but think that something may have been lurking in there all along. :( Your thoughts and or advice before I go into this appt. tomorrow would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you!  Log in to post a reply",
