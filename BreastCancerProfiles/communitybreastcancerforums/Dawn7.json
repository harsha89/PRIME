For everyone, as far as sentinel biopsy, I had heard some scary things so I made a pest of myself asking questions about it- asked if it hurt, could I be numbed first, etc. Anyway.... Day of BMX comes- anesthesiologist says\" no one had complained before and he actually said, \" I never really gave it much thought.\" So i mentioned to the preop nurse, that perhaps he would think about it if a needle was going to be inserted in HIS privates- end of story- they put me out for it. Ha!",

I had bilateral masectomies on Oct. 25- came home on the 26 with 2 drains- ugh- the worst part. No reconstruction. I know I had invasive mammary ca/mostly lobular 4mm and lcis, atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia. My nodes were negetive.I don't know stage or grade, etc until I get pathology report later this week on followup. The pain medication makes me sick even with phenergan so I'm not taking it. I don't miss my breasts one bit as I consider they were trying to kill me. The anxiety is not knowing results of path report so i can make a plan and honestly, worrying about finances. Other than that , the BMX was not a huge deal.",

I am very fortunate in that the tumor board reccomended no further treatment as the Ca was small and I am post menopausal. But heres the thing- I find myself suddenly depressed with a feeling of unreality about the whole process. I'm also scared about cancer being \" somewhere else\" as two of my relatives died of ovarian cancer. I am gene negative. They didn't do any scans. Are these feelings normal?? I was proud of myself for being brave before- now I'm feeling kind of wimpy.",

My feelings of sadness 10 days out are more about having experienced cancer than not having new breasts and concerns about a reoccurence elsewhere. That said, I am profoundly grateful to be alive and am thankful to my radiologist who spotted a very small invasive cancer before it could do more harm. Take care, Dawn",

More importantly- heres to more research, funding and finding a cure and ways to prevent this horrible disease in the first place!!! Dawn",
