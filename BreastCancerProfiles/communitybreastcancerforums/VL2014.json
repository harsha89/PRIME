I posted this on another board but I'm hoping I get more responses here. I'm desperate to gather information for my mother who was diagnosed in 2010 with Stage IV metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with breast primary. She had breast cancer over 20 years ago so they are saying the source is from that. She has a tumor that developed on her right hip and one on her pelvis on the left hand side. They initally had her on inhibitors, she then moved to Xeloda and it stopped working. She's now on Navelbine via a port. She's had a couple of rounds of it and she's having trouble dealing with some side effects. Her doctor is not helpful in this area whatsoever. He does not give her anything for pain or make any suggestions on what she can take to handle these symptoms. We have a very tough situation. I'm in the so called \"sandwhich generation\". I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old. My mom has cancer and my dad is on the waiting list for a liver transplant. It's a stressful time. I do what I can to gather information and buy things for my mom to deal with symptoms but I could use information on people's experience with this drug and how they managed it. She's had the horrible bloating/stomach pain but she's gotten it under control she thinks. She also had bad upper back pain that almost feels like neeedles pinching her. She has fatigue and depression. She takes care of my children but she fears she will soon not be able to do this any longer and this will only take her into deeper depression. Any advice, suggestions, recommendations you can make would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!! Veronica Log in to post a reply",

I have brought this up to her, about changing doctors but I think she gets overwhelmed by the thought of starting with someone new but this doctor just administers the drugs and he makes no suggestions at all for the side effects! He has flat out lied to her and said \"oh, you won't feel anything\" which is ridiculous! It's chemo! Yes some side effects are more manageable than others but I can't believe he doesn't suggest or give her anything to manage what she's going through. She's with Kaiser so she's stuck in their system which is not to say it's all bad. There are plenty of wonderful nurses there but I think I'm just going to have to push her on this. This is only getting harder and she's a very strong woman but she needs help dealing with this and I can only do so much. I buy her all kinds of natural things, supplements, foods etc but I really think she needs some pain meds and perhaps some anti-depressants. Thank you for your suggestions. I'll look into the palliative care although like I said, with ther insurance situation, I'm not sure if this will be possible.",

She's only taking the Navelbine right now and once a month she gets a dosage of a medication for her bones (sorry I can't remember what it's called, it may start with an \"F\"). And Penny what is Neulasta? Raro, yes you are right that you have to be an advocate for yourself. They've been with Kaiser for years and years now and my mom is typically not one to hold back and has indeed had to demand for things herself. I think she's just so tired and fatigued that it effects her drive to keep fighting sometimes. I did talk to her last night and pushed her and gave her suggestions you wonderful ladies have brought up here and I'll continue to do it even if it makes her upset or annoyed with me. She has options and it infuriates me that they are not being presented to her. I may have to go with her to her next appointment to try to make this better. Thank you all!",

Yes she actually discovered that coconut milk settled her stomach immensely but I will bring up the proton pump inhibitor you mention. We are hoping that when she goes in for a follow up this week that the numbers show she's responding well to the navelbine and that we can adjust her dosage. It's too much for her. You give me hope that you can still respond well with a lower dosage. Thanks again! Veronica",

I started reading on the Palliative Care today. I need to find out if any doctors practice it at Kaiser. It doesn't seem like it's widely used there, at least not at the Los Angeles hospital. I have to inquire further. My mom is 2 weeks on, 1 week off. She would like to see if she could do one every other week. My mom is very active and takes care of my kids. They give her a reason to wake up in the morning. It would devastate her if she would have to give that up now. Do you remember the drug they gave you to make the muscle pain more tolerable? Thank you so much for responding and your kind words. Veronica",
