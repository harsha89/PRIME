The fatigue hit me like a Mack truck the last week of treatment and has only gotten worse. Man!! I have never been so tired,, just wanna sleep all the time. But sleep doesnt seem to help at all no matter how much. Get so tired & frustrated being tired that I cry alot too. I did start Femara last week too, so i dont know how much is what, but I do know i can hardley function. The Dr. says it should be 4 to 6 weeks before i feel much better. Encouraging, Huh??",
