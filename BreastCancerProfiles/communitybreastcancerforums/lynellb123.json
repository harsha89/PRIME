It seems like we can't just move on from this terrible club that we all joined. I hold all of you in love & light and send positive healing out to all my sisters in need. I celebrated my 50th birthday back on Dec. 14th and did so with a big celebration and a lot of fanfare!(this is from a woman who lied so much about her age that I really wasn't sure of my real age!) My theme was BonJovi's-My Life. I love the chorus it says \"It's my life..it's now or never. I ain't gonna live forever...I just want to live while I'm alive\". That's been my mantra to live every day without regrets. Some days are easier than others. Today was a very sad day for me, I lost my beloved cat \"Butter\". He was 15 years old and very loved. I guess it was a positive thing that I was home because if I came from work and found him, I would have been devastated. He was eating and just rolled over and must have had a heart attack or stroke. He went quickly and peacefully. My other cat Lola, has been looking around for him as I'm sure I will do for the next few weeks as well. My DH has been having health issues since Thanksgiving and was finally diagnosed with Polymyalgia rheumatica. It's an inflammatory condition that affects the joints and causes a lot of pain. He went through so many crazy symptoms we didn't know what to expect. He's on a steroid right now & that's helping him somewhat, but he hasn't been himself. Please let the New Year bring positive news to all of us. I sincerely wish all of my September sisters a very happy & healthy new year. Hopefully, 2008 will offer us peace, good health and all that we hope for. Happy New Year my sisters- Much love to you all!",

My dear family Esp. my hubby try to reassure me tht I'm fine & they love me but I'm not loving myself too much these days. I'm glad to read so many of the posts that express the same sentiments. I've been feeling a bit more blue these days. I've also had the eye problems with Taxol and a runny nose that morphed into some sinus mess. I just hope that It doesn't develop into anything more serious.Good luck to everyone as we try to remain brave through this awful mess that we call \"treatment\" Gentle hugs to all!",

He passed very peacefully and that was all I prayed for. He was surrounded by his loved ones & actually had a heart attack in his sleep. It was a very emotional time, my FIL was a minister that started many churches here in the US, in Puerto Rico & in Santo Domingo. We all flew out to Puerto Rico because that is where he wanted to be buried. I am very lucky to have this amazing extended family & the trip, although very sad, was a real celebration of a life well lived. My daughters got to hear so many wonderful stories and learned more about their grandpa than they ever knew. I thank all of you for your thoughts & prayers, you are all such a wonderful support group & I send love to you all.",

I am very happy to report that my mammo went well & my gyno check up was fine too. My gyno put me on Effexor to help with the hot flashes. It is working like a charm - my flashes have become manageable and I've actually slept much better. The only problem is a big SE of Effexor is sleepiness. My doc suggested that I take it at night but by 2:30- 3:00 in the afternoon I am yawning as if I were partying all night long! I guess we have to choose our poisons. Would I rather feel a little tired or have these uncontrollable hot flashes? For now, I'm trying to get a nap when I can & get a good night's sleep. Love to my dear September sisters.
