My sister changed my dressings after surgery so she is the only one who's seen it and she said it's not as bad I think it's going to be, but to call her if I want someone to help me look.

I keep thinking one day I will fling my shirt off in front of the mirror and get on with it.....other days I think I will not look ever since I am having reconstruction anyway.  I still have my medi port and folks I can't even bear to look at THAT. My oncologist even told me last week I simply have to take this step. All the time I'm thinking \" you're a guy...what do you know about it?\" ",
