      "Content": "NoMoreHL wrote: Has anyone had a way better than expected Final Pathology Report and then began to have anxiety about it possibly being incorrect or that something was missed?  That question would describe me, so here's my story.  I was diagnosed with ILC in the LB, healthy RB. MRI in April revealed 2 \"areas of suspicion\" measuring 1.7cm and 1.4cm.  US led biopsy could only locate one of the tumors which was later determined to be malignant. I decided on BMX due to stealthy nature of ILC and a host of other reasons.   June 8 I had  BMX with immediate recon (TE's); 2 sentinel nodes removed. All clear.  5 days later my BS reads me the results of my Final Pathology Report that would make any woman do a happy dance. 0/5 nodes, one tumor present at 9 mm (< 1cm), Grade I.  She says early stage I BC. Great, right?  Then, I started to wonder about the other tumor? Where did it go? Was it missed somehow? Another troubling question: the one tumor found ended up almost half the size of the largest \"area\" seen on MRI. Is it possible some of it got left behind? This last question has really been bugging me because I have this small lemon size mound of what my PS calls fatty tissue  - - that I didn't seem to have before this operation - - below Left armpit. Did some of my breast tissue get missed and is it possible that's where the rest of my tumor and missing tumor are? (I am kind of making fun of myself here with these anxiety ridden questions, but they are very real in my mind). Yes, I did ask these questions to my BS and she stated that MRI's have a tendency to over-read, magnify things, and sometimes create false positives.  I was ok with that answer initially but as time goes on, I am hearing voices of doubt in my head. I should be elated, instead I find myself filled with anxiety.  This convalescing stage of the process with limited activity has left me with way too much time to over-think things and like the MRI, probably magnifies my concerns. However, regarding this mound of underarm flesh - which I have read is common post MX - I look at it very suspiciously as if it is harboring the missing tumors.  Looking forward to hearing from all of you who are on this journey.

However, I have read other blogs and posts of women who have it. Some are not concerned. Some are. Some ask their surgeons to not only remove it, but also biopsy the tissue.  Mine only concerns me due to the final pathology. Guess I'll have to pursue it further with my docs if I want peace of mind. I don't like feeling like a hypochondriac.",

Here's my problem: I have acknowledged it to my docs and sought help - I am having a hard time getting a response. They keep telling me this is normal for where I am in the \"timeline\" of this experience. My therapist - who can't write rx - told me to request depressions meds, but my PCP wants me to talk to my onc, and my onc's office wants me to talk to my PCP. I called PCP to schedule appointment and they deferred me to my onc - \"talk to them first\" they said. My onc's office told me I should schedule an appoint with my PCP.  I have been calling my onc's office quite a bit lately trying to get them to prescribe a depression medication. Today they responded by offering to move up my quarterly appointment to this week (was scheduled for end of month) so I could talk to my MO about all of this. Hence, the feeling of being at the end of my rope . . .  Sigh ",

      "Content": "NoMoreHL wrote: It has been 11 months since dx, 10 months since MX; I have been taking Tamoxifen since July 2011, had no chemo, no radiation. ILC, <1cm, 0/5 nodes, ER/PR+, Her2-  My reconstruction is 99% complete, simply awaiting areola tattoos in May.  May 5 will be 1 year since diagnosis. I have been a \"trooper\" - as my loved ones like to say - for the last 11 months. I bought it, too. Lately, I can not pretend that I am a \"trooper\" any longer.   I am spiraling downward mentally, and therefore, probably also physically wearing myself down. I believe I have hit bottom, in spite of seeing a therapist, becoming more involved with my church/religion, keeping a very active social calendar, yoga, meditation, self-help books, cds, podcasts and various support hotlines, as well as my online support buddies who continue to prop me up whenever I am down. I have begun to need my Xanax on a more regular basis, and in the last few days, even that offers no comfort for me. I am exhausted: mentally, physically, spiritually.  Friends and family have always been there to support me, but now that the year is almost up, my surgeries are over, and I \"look\" normal to eveyone on the outside, no one wants to hear where I am emotionally right now. They just don't get it when I tell them my fears - I am being ridiculous. Especially, because my diagnosis was \"early stage\" One friend tells me that my fear of dying is no different than her fear of dying (no, she has not ever been dx'd with cancer). She says, \"Didn't you worry about dying before you had BC? Well, how's it any different now?\"   I had to bite my tongue - - - - HARD!  I have one child, she has four. She worries all the time what would happen to them if she died. I had no response that I felt was appropriate. And yes, I DO consider her a good friend. Just one that can't relate to where I am right now and maybe never will, going forward. I feel like I simply go through the motions each and every day. To what end: I don't really know. Making things worse, I have been having body aches in various places over the last week to two weeks. My mind has offered up the worst possible scenarios and my usual \"panic stricken\"  self has accepted these as FACTS.   I am paralyzed: my life is paralyzed. I don't leave my home much during the day (am very active when family comes home at the end of the day and on weekends),  but I live a shell of a life in the daytime. I get nothing accomplished, housework wise, project wise, work wise, socially, or anything. I watch each day go by and think of all the things that I haven't done, and all the things I have done wrong.  I should be grateful for my prognosis, happy that I am here to enjoy my family and friends, soaking up every precious moment of life I have RIGHT NOW, reaching for the things of which I have always dreamed, and using this as a catalyst to live my life with more intention and purpose. Those were the promises I made to myself and my husband last year - and yet here I sit today, feeling no different than I was then. Why can't I move on? I know this happens to us all - I have read so many other posts saying the same thing - so I need help getting through this gauntlet that currently tests my will and my courage from those of you who have made it to the other side.  What were some of the tools you used to get through this, especially at the lowest of moments? I know there's no magic bullet, but something must have worked for those of you who pulled yourself through when all else seemed to fail . . . . Thanks in advance for any advice you can offer and most of all for a place to let it all out - and even if you can't offer advice, thanks for listening 'cause I know you get it  - you understand it - and you know why my fear is different from my friend's fear.  ;-) Log in to post a reply",

I am sorry that you have been diagnosed with a new primary bc, but it sounds like you have a level head and a good attitude for dealing with it. I am already doing a lot of the things you suggest, the only thing missing was a little help from depression medication. Now that is being addressed. Laurie: Nemo is one of my favorite movies but I had kind of forgotten about Dora's mantra \"just keep swimming\". What a perfect saying for exactly what we need to do. I will adopt that mantra for myself now when I need a kick in the tush! Thank you! Also I hope you get what you need by talking to a therapist. I really appreciate what I am able to take away from my sessions. And I hear you on the meds - I'm not really a fan of them either. I prefer cognitive behavioral therapy for dealing with issues, but sometimes, as I have come to learn recently, you need a little extra help. My doc says that all the positive strides I have been taking (yoga, meditation, support groups, etc.) are great, but they do nothing to affect the levels of seratonin in your system and that makes it difficult to overcome depression. So that's when medications can come in as a solution, at least for a short time, so you can work yourself out of the \"fog\". Thank you for your encouragement, beacon! violinfingers: Yes - I have known for some time that I need to get out of the house. I was a career woman once, and after 14 years as a stay-at-home mom, I have really wanted & needed to get back out there, whether it's volunteering, consulting, working p/t or f/t. I do try to exercise and have coffee/lunch dates with my girlfriends, but most work and it's hard to find the time. I plan on bumping up the exercise to new levels, just must go slowly.   PatMom: I think you are right about the one year anniversary - but I think it had more to do with anxiety related to all the 1 year follow-up \"testing\" needing to be done - it was too much of a reminder of the battery of tests, scans, x-rays that had to be done upon initial diagnosis. That's behind me for now, so I'll try to build off of that. Thanks.  lbrewer: Hugs. I hope your MX went well. Please let us know how you are doing when you get home and are feeling up to it. Crocheting is a great exercise for the mind. I like Sudoku for getting my mind off of things. stephN: I agree. I think I will ditch all the \"self-help\" stuff. My therapist suggested that it's hard to see yourself as healthy when you continue to have all these follow-up doctor appointments and keep turning to \"recovery\" books, cds, podcasts, etc. You continue to see yourself as a \"patient\" and that doesn't help you to move forward.  Starting to \"live\" again will bring more normalcy. jdwench: Thank you. We do place high expectations on ourselves that we just can't possibly achieve sometimes and that only adds to the despair. Hopefully, we can learn to lighten up a bit.  I hope your pain subsides soon. Take care of yourself.",
