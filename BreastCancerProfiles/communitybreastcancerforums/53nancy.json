Congratulations to all who have finished rads, and I hope that you get through the afterwards with no complications. And all the best to use ours who are going through rads now or waiting to start. i saw my oncologist on Thursday last week and, to my surprise, she has terminated me from Cancer Care MB and I will see only my GP in future. She is sending his office a care plan about what she feels should be done over the next 3 to 5 years, but apparently he is under no obligation to follow her plan. So, after a year and a half under her care, with three series of scans and other tests, I am done. I am pleased to be considered cancer free, but still a little concerned about recurrence. If anything comes up, my doctor is send me directly to the surgeon. But now I feel that I can move forward and, not forgetting the last two years, be thankful for how things have gone. Spring is slow to come this year, and it has been very dry, so the farmers are out seeding and keeping their fingers crossed for rain. We have crocuses blooming in our flowerbeds, with tulips and lilies now between three to seven inches high. Hubby is planning to mow for the first time this year. Now must go but wishing you all the best and will be back soon. Hugs,",

Unfortunately, though my tumor markers we're down in February six weeks after completing radiation therapy, they are now up and the C15-3 is in the abnormal range. A repeat chest, abdomen, and pelvic CT scan is being ordered, and this time they are adding a CT scan of the brain. Has anyone experienced this, and how concerned should I be? I was told in February that I only had a 4% chance of reoccurrence and I was cancer free. My oncologist doesn't want to say anything more until she gets results.

I called the doctor's office yesterday, and my estrogen and progesterone results STILL have not come in, and that biopsy was July 14th. I am so hoping the sentinel node biopsy will be negative, or it will mean more waiting to heal if they decide they have to do an axcillary node biopsy as well. I am told they are two separate procedures. It's getting harder to keep my emotions in check. I've kept myself busy this week by getting a start on Fall cleaning, so at least I feel like something is being accomplished. Went for a long walk today and enjoyed the beautiful weather.

I have been hearing that things seem to move faster in the U.S. I never had a lump, and had my mammo early because of having moved. I really don't know how I ended up having surgery as pathologist had said it was probably B9. I don't feel like I get any say; surgeon says he got all the cancer, which was quite a small lump but now it's on to the sentinel nodes. And even if they come back negative for cancer, he says radiation is a must, and chemo if they are cancerous. I guess what concerns me more than anything is that it is taking so long to get pathology reports back",

It just doesn't seem fair that women have to go through so much, especially those who are younger and have families. I hope the shingles will prove to be a mild case; I know there have been a lot of cases in our area this past winter and spring, and they haven't been easy for the people suffering from them. TWills, thanks for sharing about your SN removal. I have done so much reading that leads me to believe that for some people, things are done in a different order. My needle core biopsy and the pathology report both said probably B9, but recommended the excisional. That one was really rough; I was under a local and felt pinches and tweaks all the way through, and heard things like more freezing, more sedation. It seems they ended up taking out so much more, and I am not sure how just letting the seroma fill in the empty spot is considered breast reconstruction. The surgeon said they got the whole cancer, and I am not sure if that included both the IDC and High-Grade Comedo Type DCIS. I do hope they took that as well. I would consider saying, just do a mastectomy, but not sure it is worth it, if they got the cancer, but at the same time know that many people have cancer return within a few months or years. And I still don't know my if ER/PR are postive or negative. Her2/neu is negative. Good luck with everything, both of you, and Shel, am praying your shingles will disappear quickly. Are they treating it? ",

And I have noticed that so many people have chemo before RADS and I wonder why. My BS (who is doing my SNB next Wednesday), told me that it would be RADS for sure and then, if SN are positive for cancer, chemo. There are so many horror stories about the side effect of chemo, that I am wondering if it would be better to refuse. I have changed my diet completely, no breads, no sugars, just healthy veggies and fruits and not a lot; the plus side is I've lost a few pounds. I have been supplementing like crazy and now I am wondering, because of going under general anesthetic, if I should stop all that and when I should do it. I don't want any of it to affect my surgery.

I am trying to think of a list of questions to ask the RO when I finally get to see him, as I have not had a real chance to talk to my surgeon, and probably won't next week. He'll probably be gone before I come out of the anesthetic. Do you know if they checked your nodes right away; I read that in some places, they do a quick pathology check in case they have to take more, but have no idea what will happen here.

He didn't specify A or B for Stage 1, but the best I was hoping for was Stage IIB and I really expected it to be be Stage III. The referral to Cancer Care will be sent tomorrow, and I don't know how long I will have to wait to go to Winnipeg, but apparently the Triple Negative Status will require that, though I have been told treatment will be in Brandon. Meanwhile, I will be booked for an Abdominal CT Scan and a Full Body Bone Scan, also in Brandon, so it sounds like a busy time ahead for me. Shela, am so glad you are almost done.

Here is my story - abnormal mammo in Apr, second one first week in May, needle biopsy third week in May, and results said prob B9, then saw surgeon first week in June and thought, they are looking after things quickly. Excisional biopsy mid-July and after a month I got the news it was cancer. Everything removed. Now waiting who knows how long for sentinel node biopsy. I still don't know wheter I am ER/PR positive or negative because those reports still are not back, though I am HER2/neu neg. Surgeon says four weeks for next biopsy, but don't have a lot of faith it will happen that quickly. Then it will be more waiting for healing to be complete before radiation and possibly chemo. Does it always take this long for things to happen? Thnx for listening, and wishing all of you the best in your journey.",

I had what the surgeon called a breast \"reconstruction\" during my excisional biopsy in that they removed a really big area I think the reconstruction was just letting the seroma fill in the empty space. The breast looks more normal now, but still \"not normal\" in some ways. Still a lot of pain, but I understand that is normal. I've always said, I would have a mastectomy if necessary, but now I am conflicted. It gives no guarantee that cancer won't come back. My tumor was very small, but because of breast density, microcalcifications will always be a concern, I suppose. Just one day at a time, step by step is my motto right now. I am sorry things didn't work out the way your hoped; I see from your details that you had SLN and AxN removal at the same time? I am under the impression my surgeon plans to do only SLN, which could possibly mean a fourth biopsy. ",

Some reading I have done indicates some people wait three months or more, so I hope I fall within the six week period. I definitely would opt in future for MRI or Ultrasound in future, as I have read so much about mammograms actually being the cause of spreading cancer cells. I have read about Thermology but apparently it is illegal in Canada, and who knows what costs of having it done in the U.S. would cost. Something to definitely look into when I know more.

The radiation therapist did say that the concern is that there would be something like oil on the skin that would prevent the radiation from getting through. But since I will be showering every day and not putting anything on my skin between then and my treatment, I can't see that being a problem; there would be nothing left from the previous day. I am taking my ointments in with me tomorrow so that they can look at them, and they said they can also have someone run them over to the oncologist for him to see. They did say they didn't want anything with vaseline in it used, so maybe I will forget about the Aquaphor. I honestly don't see what the problem with Aloe Vera and Cabbage Leaves are; they just said those are old ways of dealing with radiation that are no longer in use.",

My nutritionist told me that there is no limit on how many eggs I eat during radiation, so I will probably do two eggs for breakfast three times a week. My favourite smoothie is one cup water (with three tablespoons of skim milk powderadded for duration of radiation course), spinach and blueberries to taste, one scoop of protein powder (the one I use now is 17 proteins), and one tablespoon each of ground chia, flax and quinoa. My nutritionist says quinoa is a perfect protein.",

NikJ and you are both taking a great approach and I am trying to follow that. I reached my 90 proteins today; I feel like I am eating too much, so am trying to make one 12 oz smoothie which gives me about 25 proteins. So far, I am maintaining my weight and that's all I care about. I will go back to my former diet when I get the go ahead. No skin issues yet, but today I am wiped; I hope it is due more to a lack of sleep last night than the radiation. I met a lady today who is doing chemo and rads together, and she is having 28 treatments; she has 24 to go, and is probably in her 70s. PauletteK, Ellyn27, good luck with your rads. How wonderful it is that we can get a picture of how to handle it, when we see what others are doing so successfully. tlfrank, I hope your side effects don't get any worse. I have been doing a lot of reading about the proteins, and they make so much sense. I had always heard that too high a protein diet can cause cancer, but having them higher during rads for skin rejuvenation does make sense. I am also wondering how many times people put their cream on. I had quite a bit of pain over the weenkend and today, and the rads therapist told me that is caused by swelling. So when I got home, I checked and - yes, there is swelling. My breast has always been larger than the other one, but now it seems about twice the size. Now I am going to apply more cream and settle down with a good book until I fall asleep. Six treatments down, and ten to go. I am told I will not see the radiation oncologist until the last week (two days) of treatment, and am hoping my skin issues remain minimal. Good sleeps to all of you.",

I start RADS on November 20th, and will have 16 treatments. Nothing was said to me about boosts, but I was told to stop using antioxidant supplements from a week before RADS start to a month after. My cancer is Stage 1, nodes clear (Body and Chest-Abdomen-Pelvis Scans clear), but at this point I am NED. So I refused chemo. My surgeon told me radiation is a must because of a very narrow margin of 0.1 mm when the lumpectomy was done in July, but I am surprised it is to be such a short course. I guess I will be nervous about it until I have my first treatment. Because of the Triple Negative status, I won't be able to do hormone therapy. I also am having an MRI of my brain early tomorrow morning. Wishing all of you the very best in your continuing journey and hope you do well through your RADS.",

It might be thick and gooey, but I know it can be very soothing. With the green tea, I think I saw a post about a recipe for it, and soaking pads in it and placing in a plastic bag to use after the radiation treatment. Did you do that right away, Linwentz, or wait? And are they cloth pads, as in something reusable, or something along the line of sanitary napkins? Did you cover the whole area or just the area that has been irradiated (which of course might be the whole area). :) Thanks again. ",

They will just be at a higher dose. So, I am told 4,256 centigrays divided by 16 - 266 centigrays each treatment. I have no idea what it means or whether that is a huge amount; when I asked, I was told that that was what it would be. I have googled the term but still don't understand. My biggest concern is that, because my dose will be higher and the radiation accumulative, I will experience side effects quickly, especially the fatigue. Just one day at a time, as always.",

I posted to Paulette what I use in smoothies, and now that I am using skim milk powder instead of just plain water, I figured the one I had yesterday was about 30 proteins. Is a third of what I need to do. And thanks for the other post about proteins; it is such useful information. I am so thankful for the support and information I have gotten from the ladies who post here. DodgersGirl, thanks for sharing that your proteins may have helped with fatigue. That is the thing that I am dreading the most. I am tired today, but I think that is just from a very busy week of driving back-and-forth and then, today as well, we went across to North Dakota for some shopping. I appreciate so much everyone\u2019s input to this forum, It reminds me that I will get through this. First five rads behind me, with 11 to go.

Will also see RO that day., for the first time since initial consult. Very sore and tired tonight; will hold off until bedtime to take something for pain, as I hope it will help me to sleep. Linwentz, thanks for suggestions for coping. Good luck tomorrow on your last session, and with healing.",

You get 2 g of protein fom one slice qnd she says I must have 70-90 g protein a day.

They don't want me to lose weight, even though my sugars might rise. Smoothies help me to control that. And she said that during rads I can eat lots of eggs. So two slices toast and two eggs make 16 proteins, and eggs offset carbs to keep my sugars down. Eggs are 6 g each",

I had my suspicious mammo in April, needle biopsy in May (benign), lumpectomy in July (tumor was 1.2 cm), and I was told I wouldn't have to do chemo, just RADS, probably partial breast. When I got the TN status in September, I was told yes to chemo and RADS. SN results did not come in until Septemb, but after that everything moved fast. The scans, the visit to Cancer Care and Radiation Oncologist (both this week), but I was told full breast. I am 64. I hope everything goes as you hope and will have you in my prayers also.

I had my MRI at 8:00 a.m. Sunday morning, and am hoping it won't show anything, because all the others tests came back normal. I am curious about the Emu oil, Miaderm, Calendula Cream and Aquaphor that Linwentz mentioned. Are these products available over the counter? I will have to check to see if they are available in Manitoba, but if we need to, we can make a run across the border. Or do these products come from a naturopath or health food store? And I wonder if anyone can suggest something for a rash I have developed on my breasts in the last few days. Patches of one half to one inch, red, and very itchy. I sure would like it to be cleared up before I start RADS. I would hate to have anything delay that. I wish you all the best as you start/finish rads; I am hoping the short course with larger doses won't bring on serious side effects. Hope all your treatments go well. ",

I always have good sugars after those.",

It is exactly the way I feel, and in many ways the people I have been in touch with through this website are more like family than some of my own, who don't understand or don\\t know how to handle a cancer diagnosis.

Some pinkness in my breast today, but just slight; felt a little pain this morning after treatment but once I put the cream on, it made a difference. Is the cortisone cream a prescription? I want to see about getting that ahead of time, as I understand that the itchiness, etc. continues on for a while after treatment ends. I am so glad to see that you have the end of the tunnel in sight; you will be finished next Friday. I have nine more treatments; three this week, four next (Friday, the machine is having maintenance done on it) then two days the week after. There are no boosts for me. Teese, wishing you all the best in your treatment course; it will seem like a long time, but I find the time is going surprisingly fast. But I am on a shorter course, and you are on a longer one; so sorry it has to take you over Christmas. Sure hope you get through without difficulties; I am really pushing to keep the proteins high and hope they help with the skin care. DodgersGirl, I have a dumb question; is the dead skin flaky looking, different colour, etc? When you say healing phase, are you talking about your surgery or your rads? I am more tired tonight, but I hope it is just lack of sleep and not fatigue yet. Wish I could stop my brain from working during the night. But I'm headed to bed soon; it seems we plan to just go for treatment, then come home again, and yesterday we ran into friends and had coffee together, and then more friends who wanted to have coffee together. Today it was my SIL need to talk out her troubles; it doesn't usually bother me, but today I found it tired me out. So hoping for a better sleep tonight. Hope you all get a good sleep, too. Hugs.",

I had hear here about extending the area covered by creams, and have been doing that since a week before treatment. I was told I could only use Lubriderm and Base Glaxol, and no to my choices. When I brought my Calendula ointment in (got it at the health food store), they approved it, but would not agree to my essential oils or any lotions containing them, and said no aloe vera. I have completed my first five rads out of 16, and no effects showing on my skin yet. I shower every morning and do not apply any lotions to my skin until immediately after radiation, and then I do it generously, up to the collarbone, mid breast, over beneath my armpit and two inches below the bra line. I think - better to be safe than sorry. At present, I am applying my creams three times a day, but may up to more. Not sure how much is too much. Good luck with your rads and I hope it goes well for you with minimal side effects. As far as the protein diet, I have been told 70-90 g a day; I thought it would be difficult but am amazed at how high in proteins dairy products are. I don't use dairy products normally but guess I can live with it for as long as I have to. Today, I had no problem reaching my goal. I am also using ground flax, chia and quinoa in smoothies with a protein powder and one I made yesterday had about 30 proteins. I usually make them with water but am using milk or adding skim milk powder for the duration. AngelaJL, I went to the thrift store and got a bunch of cheap tea shirts to wear at home over the creams. Then they can go back or go to garbage. I did buy some \"big\" tops for going to treatments at the thrift shop as well and they will be gone, too, when I am finished. I was told I couldn't use the Aquaphor so, yesterday when we went across to North Dakota, I was able to return it and get my money back, so am pleased about that. I thought of keeping it, but am not a fan of vaseline based creams. I do like the ones I am using, so may keep that up from now on. I enjoyed everyone's post today; first chance I have had to be on the computer, but now I must get back to my company, so will just wish you all a good weekend and good luck with ongoing and upcoming rads. I anyone finishing up this week? ",

I am so happy for those who are close to finishing or have. I had my 12th treatment of 16 today and now my skin is pink, but patchy rather than solid in colour. No skin issues and I hope I can get through the last four without any. But yes, the fatigue is hard. I have done some of the driving up until yesterday, but now my husband feels he should do the rest. Poor guy; I know he is tired, too, but at least he manages a good sleep at night. Lifechoices2017, I think the lotions make a huge difference; I am doing four times a day now. They may be overdoing it, but better safe than sorry. Linwentz, how are the boosts going? Three more and you are done! Yaay",

Linwentz, I am and will be okay. Don't know why the worry has crept in again, but I can get past it. I had a so-so sleep Thursday, but last night got eight hours! So unusual for me. :) have a great weekend",
