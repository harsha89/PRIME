With it being the highest cancer in my area I wanted to do something. I can't make a shot to not get it but I thought you guys go through a lot, you fight and then are stuck with this problem of not having comfortable bras or heavy inserts. One of my favorite teachers recently started reconstruction and complains how uncomfortable it is to have your bra rise up or the fear of the insert falling out. I joined hosa and decided to do a medical innovation on them. I was wondering if you had any ideas or things you wish you could change about the bra or insert. What have you difficulty so I can work to change it. Thank you for your time. Log in to post a reply",
