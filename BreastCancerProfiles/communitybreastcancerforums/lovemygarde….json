You know, every holiday season there is the inevitable public hue and cry over the crass commercialization of Christmas: that a religious holiday has been co-opted to the \"service of the Almighty Dollar\". Seems to me that the Pink Industry has done the same thing with breast cancer; the only difference is that we who are offended by it have not yet made our voices heard.",

Ha. As if. I realize that the victims of many other serious diseases would love to have their cause get even 1/4 the marketplace attention that bc gets -- which raises this question: Do they too resent the Pink Marketing, and especially Pinktober, for that reason? I certainly wouldn't blame them if they did. There is a fine line between awareness/fundraising and exploitation, and IMO the pink industry has crossed it. ",

I saw that I fit the profile, and also saw that the other causes of what I was seeing on my skin were either impossible or highly unlikely. As a result, I hied myself to my dermatologist the next day and told him \"Do a biopsy of this, just to rule out Paget's.\" He said \"I doubt it's that.\" I said \"Do it anyway for my peace of mind.\" The rest is history.",

Or heard such a person say \"I am an X-year heart disease survivor\"? Or diabetes?  I bet not; but according to Cancer Survivor Logic you should have. They all experience(d) the effects of a disease that could have killed them at the time but because of medical intervention it did not do so. On a lighter note, about a month ago I went into a store and the cashier, seeing my Style By Chemo headscarf look, said with a big perky smile \"I see you're a survivor!\"     Some warped inspiration prompted me to give her a wide-eyed innocent look and say \"Oh you must be mistaking me for someone else, I've never been on the show. Eating bugs is so not my thing!\", gave her a bright smile, took my package and walked out of the store (perkily   ).",

I don't consider myself brave, when all I did was cope as best I could with the unexpected and unwelcome hand that I was dealt. That's not \"bravery\", that's just living daily life as an adult is expected to do. What did they think, that I'd walk around like Cassandra prophesying doom, or be unable to crack a smile or a joke? Sheesh. And yes the cluelessness about post-bc life abounds. I have a friend who calls every couple months since my dx and asks how I am feeling. I say \"just fine\" (because it's true) and that I have X more months to go of Herceptin but other than taking a couple hours out of every week it's no big deal. And every time, she says \"So now you're cured, right? You had your surgery and they got it all, and the chemo is just insurance.\"  I just respond by saying that yes they removed the tumors and got clear margins and it hadn't spread to my lymph nodes, because I think it would be hurtful and upsetting to her if I gave the 100% honest response which would be that the word \"cured\" is not one that should ever be used to a cancer patient, since we know better than that. I also don't burst her bubble about Herceptin (she's under the impression that it \"works\" for everyone who gets it).  I can't help but wonder if all the Pinkified images of bc have contributed to her \"find it - get treated - life will be all good again\" mindset. We need reality, just like we get on CNN etc when there's a disaster, or watching Michael J. Fox and comparing what he is now to what we remember him as being before Parkinson's. Yes those things are upsetting to see and elicit a gut reaction; they NEED to be. But what do we get? People smiling in a chemo chair, and cutsey pink ribbons slapped onto everything. Bleah.",

Not to mention that if their peers and/or teachers know their mom etc has bc and the kid doesn't WANT to wear pink on that day, look out, here comes the stigma and funny looks again (\"How come you're not wearing pink today to support your mom and moms like her?\").

The inescapable fact is that no matter how many people are 'made aware', there will always be a big percentage that are in denial OR for whatever their reason may be, choose not to do self-exams and/or get a mammogram (not that either of those are a guarantee of bc discovery, as much as the Pinks make it sound as if they are). I speak from personal experience because I was one of those people. But I take full responsibility for my decisions and I don't put one iota of blame on \"lack of awareness\" because dammit I've been hearing the bc-awareness refrain for what, 20 years? As the old saying goes, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink. I was beat over the head with Pink Awareness for decades but it never made me choose to do or to not do anything. Operative word: choose. That's what it all comes down to, every day, about so many things including our health. Not what we 'know' intellectually, but what we each choose to do. I was extraordinarily lucky to be one of the rare 1% of bc victims who develop Paget's and that's the only reason that my cancer was discovered while it was still Stage II. Despite all the Pinkwashing out there, it was my own body that found the one and only way to smack my brain upside the head and say \"Hey stupid, yoo-hoo, there's something wrong here\" in a way that I couldn't fail to notice and investigate. The Pink Brigade had absolutely nothing to do with it.",

      "Content": "Oct 21, 2010 11:12AM - edited Oct 21, 2010 11:23AM by lovemygarden I happened to go to a Tanger mall yesterday and of course they are having a Pinktober promo. Two actually: a so-called \"Pink Card\" which is in reality a one-time-use 25%-off coupon which costs $1 (the $1 is the only money that supposedly 'goes' anywhere), and a \"Shop & Save in Style\" pink Tanger Outlet t-shirt for $16.50.  http://www.tangeroutlet.com/pink As you can see, the web page says \"All funds from the Pink Cards will be donated to a designated breast cancer beneficiary\" and that \"Beneficiaries vary by center. Select your Tanger center for the designated beneficiary in your area\".  Oooookay, so \"funds from the Pink Cards\" means just the $1 that is paid for the card/coupon (not the 25% discount). Let's say they sell, what 100 of these per day? Hypothetically. So that's $100/day x 25 days (since the promo ends today) = a whopping $2500 \"donated\". That doesn't even pay for one day in a semi-private hospital room for one bc mastectomy patient! Big whoop even at 3x that amount. Impressed I am not. But, moving on: I was curious as to who the \"beneficiary\" of this stupendous donation will be, so I looked up that Tanger center on the website. No mention anywhere of a \"beneficiary\" (don't you love that word in this context? Makes it sound as if the money is going to a needy bc patient, doesn't it? Sneaky marketing ploy that manages to be the epitome of vagueness -- not even the generic \"organization\" or \"charity\" normally seen in such promos!) anywhere. Also, not all of the stores in the outlet participate in the coupon promo. And among the ones that do, not all honor the pink coupon for all merchandise. The one that I went to (Coldwater Creek outlet) only allows the discount for certain types of merchandise, not on clearance (anthing 50% off or more) items. I know because I overheard a \"discussion\" between a customer and the gal behind the register. The customer was arguing that the Coach outlet allowed the card to be used on all merchandise, even clearance items. Interesting. And lastly, the T-shirt does not provide any kind of donation whatsoever. Apparantly they assume that people will pay $16.50 for a pink t-shirt in order to (a) advertise the Tanger Outlet mall system and (b) supposedly make the wearer look like a Shopper Who Cares.  This greedy mall company doesn't even bother to try to suck women in with the premise of a donation but instead thinks that to \"show your style and [show your] support [of the idea of finding a cure for bc someday]\" is sufficient reason for someone to spend $16.50. (clearly they rank shoppers' intelligence somewhere between that of an amoeba and a lemming) Hopefully nobody bought any of these shameless attempts to cash in on our disease but the cynic in me fears that at least some got suckered into it. Because even besides the stupid t-shirt, the mall stores profit by people buying things that they might otherwise not have bought had they not been able to pay $1 for the 25%-off coupon. Gotta keep those cash registers ringing!",

As I'm about to walk out the door from chemo, one of the gals at the front desk calls me over (which puzzled me, as I pay as I come in, not going out). She then hands me a box wrapped in (of course) pink paper and topped with a (what else?) pink bow, saying \"This is for you, from the office\". Now, my b-day is next week which the onc nurses know about because I'm a longterm patient there so silly me, I think that maybe they were nice enough to get me a gift. So I gave her a very heartfelt \"Thank you, you're very sweet!\" and headed out to the car, where I then unwrapped the gift. Inside the box (which was printed all over with encouraging phrases like \"Attitude is Everything\") was a BC-pink plastic sports water bottle (which I assume was made without BPA, although I didn't check, LOL!) and a BC-pink-ribbon pin mounted on a card which said in (naturally) big pink letters \"Early detection is the best protection.\"  (obviously this was NOT a b-day gift, but instead a Pinktober one to either all their female patients or maybe -- could they BE so insensitive?? - only the ones being treated for bc) What the (*&&%$#?! \"Protection\"??????? Against getting BC?? We all know that's a lie. Against mets? That's a long long stretch of 'logic' and circumstances. Against dying from BC? I assume that is what's meant, supposedly, although the catchy phrase is not further explained, supported, or verified. Talk about Pink Ribbon B.S.!!!! I'm currently reading \"Pink Ribbon Blues\" by Gayle Sulik and find myself nodding in agreement with something on almost every page. A few very pertinent phrases that I've found so far are: \"The primary function of pink ribbon culture is now to maintain breast cancer's status as a women's health epidemic, uphold the image that society is doing something about it, expand the social and political influence of key players in the breast cancer movement, and keep the money flowing.\" and \"The most controversial issue involves the survival benefits of mammography. Mammography may not detect fast-growing malignancies early enough to affect cure; it leads to more aggressive treatment... and it offers only a modest benefit for women age 50 to 70 and a lesser benefit among women age 40 to 49. Still, pink ribbon culture widely promotes mammography as the best weapon against breast cancer, fundamentally presenting it as a form of prevention, while omitting discussion of other causes...\" \"The industry that benefits from the increased use of mammography and pharmaceuticals is at the core of what has become pink ribbon culture.\" and one of my favorites so far \"Pink ribbon culture is built upon the early breast cancer movement... and is sustained by mass publicity, the cancer industry, corporate and political interests, and a steady revenue stream. ... At this point a pink ribbon on any product or service signifies the good cause of breast cancer. Eradication of breast cancer is the headline, but when looking beneath the pink products and consumption practices, breast cancer as a social problem has become little more than a brand name with a recognizable pink logo. Survivors and supporters walk, run, and purchase for a cure as incidence rates rise, the cancer industry thrives, corporations claim responsible citizenship while profiting from the disease, and breast cancer is re-stigmatized for those who question or deny the pink ribbon model.\" Strong words but IMHO they ring absolutely true. Btw, the box and items inside got tossed into the first trashcan I passed!",

It does nothing useful to help anything or any bc patient. It's nothing more than yet another ultra-sanitized, politically-correct and useless display. The notion that X number of colored ribbons fluttering in the breeze would even remotely show the \"true impact\" of this disease is one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of: that it could ever convey to anyone else, in any meaningful sense whatsoever, the real-life cost of the disease -- not only in dollars and cents out of cancer patients' pockets but in the hours lost and personal hells experienced by each of us. Also, these Facebookers should keep in mind that we who find the Pink objectionable have enough to deal with, being bombarded with the marketing in stores, on products, in the media, etc, without having to ALSO get it thrown in our faces every time we drive down the street! Where is any sensitivity to fellow-patients' feelings in this idea?? \"Let's have a public head-count of how many people in our community are dealing what kind of cancer\" -- for what? \"Awareness\"? Awareness, schmareness. Enough already. Everybody \"knows about\" bc, just like everybody knows that if you smoke you're likely to end up with lung cancer and they didn't have to slap brown ribbons all over creation to get that message across.Oh but wait, they couldn't have built such an attractive and lucrative marketing campaign on that disease.",

A question for those who have one: How would you say they compare to both silicone and foam as far as weight? Are they about midway been those two types? Because to me the silicone ones seem to weigh a ton, while the fiberfill pouffies that came with my post-surgical camisole have barely enough substance to them to keep their shape. I have a 'wrist rest' bag next to my computer that has those little bean type things inside a leatherette cover; I'd guess it's just a little bigger than a Been-a-Boob might be. So I just now held the wrist-rest in one hand and the Amoena silicone foob in the other; surprisingly, they seem to be about the same weight, with the wrist-rest possibly a tad heavier. Jan, would you agree with that or do you think the B-a-B is lighter than the silicone?",

If you're not sure which of two different sizes to order, you can order both and then return whichever size doesn't work (or both, if neither do). As for how often you need to replace them, the consensus seems to be that the silicone ones \"should\" be replaced every 2 years but that is based on them being worn on a daily basis! If, like me, you either go flat or switch to using the much less expensive foam or fiber ones during 50% or more of your waking hours, I'd think that the silicone forms should last at least twice as long, wouldn't they?

I too wonder why shop fitters keep pushing the \"bra's gotta be tight\" thing despite our protests that it feels uncomfortable. In retrospect I wish I'd bought the 36A Classique instead of the 34A but hey, that's what those handy bra-band extender tabs were made for! I have a question for Barbara and anyone else who has tried one of the microbead breastforms (either the Silique \"1st Choice Microbead Triangle\", or the Been-a-Boob, or similar): Do they work well in camisole pockets, or are they too \"floppy/saggy\" for that? Logically it seems as if they would need a fairly small/tight pocket to keep their shape. ",

      "Content": "Mar 31, 2010 06:59AM - edited May 14, 2010 02:33PM by lovemygarden Thanks all, I was SO happy to get that refund for the $$$$$ forms!  I ordered both the Silique Comfort-Lite and the Illusions TriForm to see how/if they worked for me. The Silique in size 4 is perfect in the Anita Nastaja bra! However I found it a royal PITA to insert into the Classique 469 because the pocket opening in the Classique is much smaller and tighter, and the Silique form (being very soft and flexible, almost like a beanbag feeling) isn't firm enough to \"push\" its way through the small opening easily. The firmer forms like the regular silicone and the Amoena fiberfill puffies, though larger, are easier to shove into the Classique because of their greater solidity. So I can see that I'll be pairing the Silique forms with the Nastaja bra instead.  The Illusions Triform was way too big for my liking, even in the A size -- Barbara, you were so right about these running large/full!! But that is the smallest size they make, so I'm returning them.  Just FYI, when I ordered the Illusions I was under the impression that they are priced individually ($76 per form) just like every other form I have seen for sale --- even the cheap $8 Amoena puffies. The photo shows just one form and the item info says the price is $76 each. So, needing two for my BMX, I ordered two. When they arrived I discovered that it was 2 PAIR .. they are packaged in little ribbon-tied net bags as pairs. It doesn't matter since they ended up not working for me anyway, but IMO the Still You site should definitely be clarified to say \"$76 per pair\" even if they don't want to re-shoot the photo to show that the price is for 2 forms, not just 1 as is the norm for others.  I may try the Amoena Leisure Form 126 to see if that is firm enough to insert into the Classique 469 pocket without a struggle but also not feeling too big and clunky.",

Their return policy is that forms must be returned within 7 days.. not 30 days. And since I bought them on February 17th (my surgeon said that I could be fitted for them after 2 weeks since I healed on the outside so well, and I was determined to take care of as much as possible before starting my chemo this coming week, so I rushed) I am way past the 7-day limit. So it looks like I am stuck with an expensive mistake. :-( I was also wrong about the price: They were $325 each, not $300. I've been inundated with so many cancer-related bills this past month that I can't always recall how much was for which thing. So the forms cost me $650, not $600... talk about adding insult to injury. Barbara, the fitter did show me the Natura Light but also said they would cost almost $100 more than the Essentials ones, so I didn't think they'd be worth it just for the difference in material in an area that wasn't going to touch my skin anyway. Now about the bras.... what I remembered as being the 30-day return policy is only for bras. BUT... there is a kicker... they are only returnable if all the original tags are still attached. Which are the tags that I naturally removed after getting the bras home and hand-washing them in advance of first use. So I can't return those either. I can only hope that someone new to this site reads this and finds in it a cautionary tale, so that at least some good can come from my very expensive mistake!",

When I immediately saw what a hassle it was to try to insert the form into the Classique bra pocket, I just popped it into the Anita instead. I never thought that the other piece inside the \"pair bag\" wasn't a second Illusions Triform ... it absolutely did look like one though. By the time I saw your post I'd already shipped the order back to Still You for a refund, so can't doublecheck that anymore.  By the way, I noticed your BreastForms page mentions the Silique Comfort-Tex but on their site it looks like the only \"Comfort\" model they offer now is the Comfort-Lite.",

It's that Classique 769  bra which I'm looking for an easier-to-insert form for. I have an Amoena 126 on backorder and want to compare that with the Fabu-Form to see which (if either) I prefer.  I also have a question about camisoles. I've been looking at the three different Still You ones on their page (the plain, the lace, and the Square Neck tank) but here's the thing: I have always really disliked tops that have those skinny little spaghetti straps.    And I also don't like camis that look like \"underwear\" either (no matter what the current fashion trend may be). So the only one of the three that appeals to me at all -- because it looks like a normal top rather than 'underwear' -- is the Square Neck tank. (the $72 price tag unfortunately doesn't appeal, though; ouch!) And that one only comes in \"Creme\" which looks white on my computer but I'm guessing it's an off-white which hopefully doesn't look like a yellowed-with-age white? Have you ever tried that one? I read in your reviews that the other two tanks (the ones with the spaghetti straps) are pulled down by a weighted form and so you recommended only using unweighted forms with those two; but I'm just wondering if you have also tried their Square Neck tank and if so, does it perhaps fare better in that regard because it's not a spaghetti-strap style? more fabric up there to keep the shelf/form in place maybe??",

I hadn't thought of that, and honestly don't know if that's a feeling I'd be comfortable with! The only cami I've worn at all so far has been the post-surgical one and because my skin was so sensitive for the first weeks I didn't even put the puffies in it... just wore it so that I'd have something to put the drain bulbs into while I still had them! Guess I should haul that one out and try it with puffies to see if I find the feeling of \"floating boobs\" annoying or not. Duh! Mini-rant: Why are post-mastectomy garments like the camis and tank tops so darn expensive? I mean seriously... do most women spend $60-$70 for a basic tank top or cami under normal circumstances? Does the addition of breastform pockets really justify that kind of pricepoint over and above something that would sell for $19.99 or $24.99 at someplace like DressBarn? Not singling out Still You by any means... the other companies that sell post-surgical camis for $60-$80 each are just as bad. I even found a site whose prices start at $80-$100 (www.annjacquelinedesign.com/tank-tops)! I did see that the TLC catalog sells them for $18 but also read several posts by women here who ordered them and returned them because the quality was really poor, even for something at that low a price. Am I naieve for thinking that there should be good quality, practical useful garments like this in the, say, $30-$40 price range?   Okay, rant over.",

      "Content": "Apr 17, 2010 06:30PM - edited May 15, 2010 03:07AM by lovemygarden Robin, so sorry to hear that you're still so sensitive/uncomfortable 3 months out.   Guess I was very lucky to have had all those issues disappear permanently at 5-6 weeks post-op!  Barbara, my Fabu-Forms came yesterday and although I expected them to feel comfortable I was disappointed. Apparantly I do not like the feel of anything either solid or weighty; it's hard to describe other than to say that I feel as if I'm putting on a piece of armor (whether it's in a bra or in a cami). It just feels very very annoying.   So I'm going to try one last time and will exchange the Fabu-Forms for Silique's 1st Choice Micro-Bead forms. Since they are completely flexible I shouldn't have any \"solidity\" issues and since they weigh less than an ounce they won't pull a cami down. In fact I haven't even decided whether I like wearing a cami/form combo! I know I don't like it with any of the several forms I have so far tried with them. If I still don't like them when tried with the micro-bead forms then I'll just say the heck with the entire cami idea; but at this point I don't know whether I dislike them because I haven't found a form that feels right for me when used with a cami, or whether I just don't like the cami thing period. By way, FYI on the weight of a size 4 Fabu-Form: it's 2.4 ounces. So here are some weight comparisons between the different kinds of forms in the same size (4): Amoena 126 poly foam: 0.6 ounce; Amoena fiberfill puffy: 0.8 ounce; Silique Fabu-Form Triangle weighted foam: 2.4 ounces; Silique Comfort-Lite (lightweight silicone/microbead combo): 4.2 ounces.  If after trying the microbead forms I still don't like the sensation of \"foreign objects\" against my chest, I may just see if wearing a standard firmly-molded-cup bra (without anything stuffed inside it) works best for me. I'm not a \"social hugging\" person anyway, so the only reason I would wear a bra in the first place is solely for 'visual effect'. From what I've read, the problem with wearing an empty regular bra is that the front will ride up; is that correct? If so, I'm wondering if some creative sewing ideas might result in some way to weigh down the front band area (not the cups themselves) just enough to keep the bra front in place; I'm going to give it some thought.  arby, thanks for the tip on the camis; there is a Target near me so I will take a look next time I'm up that way. I did order one of the TLC camis plus a Luisa cami  at about twice the price from another source; I was surprised to find not much difference in quality even though I expected the TLC one (from disappointing experiences with their headwear) to be  something I wouldn't like. The fit is different (the TLC medium runs a bit bigger and thus doesn't fit quite as snug as the Luisa, which for me is an advantage for the TLC) but visually the two look almost identical. ",

You ordered the same size as I would be ordering in that form.",

I'm still waiting for a response from Hidden Beauty as to the weight of those Fabu-Forms  but am glad to hear that they are softer than the Amoena 126s which I received on Friday. I weighed one of those and it was 0.6 ounce. So in order of weight from low to high, they are the lightest of the ones I have so far:  Amoena 126 poly foam, size 4 = 0.6 oz; Amoena fiberfill, size Small = 0.8 oz; and Silique Comfort-Lite Size 4 = 4.2 ounces. It sounds as if the Triangular weighted Fabu-Form may end up being between 2 and 3 ounces perhaps. You mentioned on your site that some of the weighted foam forms can be a little too heavy to use in camisoles and weigh the cami front down a bit; just curious, did you find that to be the case at all with the Fabu-Form that you just got? ",

Thank you SOOOOO much for the tip about the Target camis!!!   I went there today and looked in the sportswear, activewear, and intimates sections at all the cami-type tops, not knowing which one you meant. At first all of them with a shelf bra were open at the bottom (so a foob would fall out.. not workable) but then I saw the camis on one of the bra displays. They had one style by Gilligan & O'Malley that has \"removable cups\" (which are no more than thin fabric shapers) but they are in actual \"breastform pockets\"! Tada!  Better yet, it was the fabric I wanted (96% cotton). Even better, it has adjustable straps. BEST yet... only $12.99. So I bought one to bring home and try with my fiberfill foob (since I haven't received the Silique microbead ones yet)... OMG, not only does it fit perfectly and is light enough to wear under all my tee-tops but.... because of the ultra skinny straps and v-neckline, the entire  cami clears my port area! Which is something that my Classique bra does not do, and my Anita bra just barely does (depending on how I move). I am so ordering more of these online, since they only had 1 white in size M in the store (I wish they came in more colors than white, black, and fuchsia though). Thank you so much!",

It weighs 6.2 ounces. If I'm reading the B-a-B size chart correctly, I would be a \"Size 2, 6\" \" ; the chart says it's 5.50 oz which is 7/10 of an ounce lighter than the silicone one. But it says that size is not available in the \"Light\" version. I am curious as to why they suggest a round B-a-B instead of the triangular (\"heart\") one which I would think would fit better into the bra pocket. After all, the typical breastform which fits into a mastectomy bra pocket is a triangular shape, so what's the logic of having the B-a-B in a round shape instead? Just trying to visualize what purpose the round one serves over the triangular one. I realized today that I was looking at the original item-order date on the mastectomy shop's breastform receipt (Feb 17th) instead of the day that I actually went to get them, which was March 3rd. That's the date that I paid for (charge card receipt is dated 3-3-10) and got them. So their 7-day return period expired last Wednesday, March 10th. They are closed on Sundays and Mondays, so tomorrow (March 16th) is the soonest I can go there and see if they will agree to a return. IMO I am only three days past their \"return period\" because the store is closed on Sundays and Mondays, at least at the location where I bought them. It will be interesting to see if they will be a stickler about the 7 days or not. For $650 it is certainly worth a try! They open at 10:30 and I plan to walk through the door at 10:35, forms and receipt in hand... wish me luck!!",

I realize that it's just overstitching but to me those edges were very annoying, and the hard feel of the form itself made me feel like I was wearing one of those old vintage Madonna cone bras. So overall I was far more aware of the 126 being there than I am with either the Comfort-Lite or the Amoena fiberfill. As for the shape, I actually thought it looked smaller (less projection) than the other two, which IMO didn't help shape my front very much. I can see that the fiberfill puffy will so far probably be my choice for wearing under the bulkier winter sweaters with which I used to wear a more padded bra anyway.   I haven't worn a swimsuit in more than ten years and don't intend to ever again, so that's not an issue with me. ",

      "Content": "Apr 22, 2010 04:29AM - edited May 15, 2010 03:07AM by lovemygarden otter, that's really interesting (but what a bummer ) about the swelling from bras. I had 2 negative sentinel nodes removed on my left side, with my BMX almost 3 months ago and have had no swelling (knock wood); but.... other than for brief fittings/try-ons, I have not been wearing a bra of any kind. I prefer to go flat whenever I can, so I hope I will only \"have to\" wear a bra on rare occasions and for no more than a couple of hours at most. That's why I'm now so happy to have found a workable alternative (cami) for casual social wear otherwise. As I understand what you said, the swelling only occurs when you've worn a bra that does NOT press tightly on the underarm area? Wouldn't it be more logical for something that's tight to cause swelling by pressing on sensitized spots, than to prevent it? Or is it that the pressure from a lower cut bra is on the 'wrong' (lower) spot rather than the 'right' (higher) one?  So having either zero pressure (no bra) or lots of pressure (tight high-underarm bra) are the safest options?",

      "Content": "Apr 25, 2010 09:59AM - edited May 15, 2010 03:08AM by lovemygarden Got my newest \"tryout\" today, the Silique 1st Choice microbead leisure forms in size 4. Wow, these are SUPER-LIGHT ... only 0.4 ounce, which makes them the lightest I've tried (exactly 1/2 the weight of an Amoena fiberfill puff-foob). I tried them in my 2 bras and one workable Target cami. They worked great in my Anita Nastaja bra, in fact the only difference I felt between these and the Comfort-Lite forms (other than the weight) is that I like the feel of the slightly concave/flat back on the Comfort-Lite a bit better. But I will definitely be using the microbead forms in this bra for all but \"state occasion\" dressing (at that rate, my Comfort-Lites should last me for about 15-20 years! seriously) In the Target cami which has a largish pocket, I would have liked to have more \"projection\" in front than the microbeads give.... but on the other hand they are lighter and far softer against my chest than the fiberfill foobs are. And as usual, my Classique bra turned out to be the most annoying with this form as well. How an undersized pocket can end up having way more wrinkle/sag issues than the larger pocket in the same-size Anita, with the exact same form, I have no idea. I swear I'm going to buy some fiberfill and some fabric and try to run up some kind of custom foob myself on my sewing machine that might possibly end up being easy to insert (ha!), comfortable, and the proper shape for that annoying Classique pocket. Because other than Silique's fiberfill foob, I've run out of things to try in that bra. Sure wish I hadn't been talked into buying two of the dratted things but at $40 each I hate to just toss them away.",

So 1 year total. Check out the March 2010 Chemo thread for my \"reaction drama\"! Update on the foobs: Had a message last night from the fitter saying that because I \"had worn the forms\" they could not take them back. I called her this morning to explain that other than at the fitting itself, the only other time I'd worn them was when I got dressed for my lunch on the 10th and discovered that the weight of them caused the bra strap to hit my port every time I moved. So at most I was wearing them what, maybe 5 minutes?? She said she'd have to discuss it further with the boss/owner who \"will not be available until next Wednesday\" (???? there's this newfangled invention called the telephone, you know...) and she will get back to me with a final answer then. So the refund situation is still in limbo for awhile...",

I see on the Comfort-Tex retailer's site they also sell a weighted foam form by Silique called the Fabu-Form and I'm wondering if that is midway in weight and solidity between the \"stiff\" fiberfill-packed lightweight ones and the more flexible Comfort-Lite. I'm going to email them and ask the actual weight of the Fabu-Form to compare (because I'd like to find something solid enough to stuff into that darn Classique pocket while still being flexible and lightweight).",

Thanks for clarifying! I'm sorry if I gave the impression of criticizing Still You in particular because that wasn't my intention at all.  I totally agree that an indepedent small company who makes or sells good quality merchandise should charge a price commensurate with that! But what irks me bigtime is that a lot of mass-produced made-in-China mediocre-quality clothing of any type is often priced the same as what the better-quality stuff sells for, and it seems to me that any kind of \"special needs\" clothing often has that failing plus a \"special needs markup\" built into the pricing. When I first started shopping for headcovers I ordered a lot of items from the TLC site and ended up returning all but one sleep cap and one made-in-Canada winter hat (which I'd seen the same on another website but for $8 more) because I was so disappointed in the quality of all the other stuff.  I do buy other \"special needs\" clothing, actually: SPF50 items for sun protection because my skin \"fries\" very easily. I buy them from either Coolibar or Sunday Afternoons because both offer good quality but because of the prices I can only afford to buy when they are having really good sales on things! Like the $60 pants I got from Coolibar for $19.99. There's no way I would ever have bought them for $60 but at $19.99 that's the same as what I'd pay for a pair of jeans at DressBarn and so I'm very happy with that.",

Here's a thought that just occurred to me: If any of your current bra bands are too tight, have you tried using one of those inexpensive bra-band extenders to see if any of the several hooks will release enough pressure to avoid triggering your LE swelling? I had to do that with my 34A mastectomy bras purely for comfort reasons. The extender allows me to get just the fit I like, which apparantly is somewhere between a 34 and a 36 band. I've seen the bra extenders in the Notions dept at Jo-Ann stores, and in the lingerie dept at Macys; I'm sure other stores have them too.",

See my thread 'Why do I 'need' $$$ silicone breastforms?' for some great discussion and how I've fared in my search so far.

Another point to consider. Let's face it: As women age (and I'm now 60) even the smaller breasts look less and less \"attractive\", shall we say...    .... and personally I consider it a fringe benefit to be spared having to watch what gravity, time, and Mother Nature would've done to those particular body parts in another 15 - 20 years!",

That annoyed me bigtime but  apparantly is nothing to what they put travelers through nowadays!  I used to like to fly but as I've gotten older I have lost all of my patience with what I call \"all that airport crap\" and it's no longer worth it to me. So nowadays if it's not someplace within a 5 or 6 hour's drive (one way), I have no desire to go. I did a decent amount of traveling in the US and Europe while I was in my 20s and 30s anyway, so I've been there/done that while I still had the patience and energy to really enjoy it and shrug off the hassles. I don't even like staying in hotels anymore, haven't for years and years! The only \"bucket list\" place I'd like to visit is Australia, but the prospect of 15 hours in a plane gives me the shudders. Just not worth  it if I can't get into my own car, buckle up, and get from Point A to Point B on my own terms. If I did ever absolutely HAVE TO fly at some point in the future, I just wouldn't wear foobs. Heck, I don't even wear them 90% of time anyway!  ",

I'm looking for something to wear during the spring and summer without having to add a second layer of clothing which is what a camisole would do. I want to be able to wear just a bra and a top, rather than a camisole and a top. But because that Still You Bra looks (from the photo at least) as if the front/cup section comes up high ... of course it's impossible to tell without a photo of it actually on a person, drat it! .... I was wondering if it does indeed come up higher than the Classique 769 or whether it's just the photo making it look so, well, \"big and chunky\". It does look (to me anyway) more like a sports bra design than a normal bra, with those wide-looking sides and front -- almost like it's midway between a bra and a mini-cami. But again that could just be the type of photo. I wish I could find a photo of it actually being worn by a model! Also, one of the Google links from \"Still You Bra\" says that this is a \"step-in\" bra, although none of the other sites mention that. Does it really not have any hooks?? In that case I wouldn't want it, but you'd think that if it was a step-in, it would be mentioned on the manufacturer's site. I found another site with some Classique bras on sale and noticed their #740 which appears from the photo to have a narrow strap. Are you familiar with that model? www.womanspersonalhealth.com/b... The sale bras are \"no returns\" so even at $20 each I'm hesitating a little (no insurance). Looking at the different models including my #769, I'm wondering if the shop gal was fibbing when she said that one has the \"narrowest\" straps because a couple of those other Classique models sure do look like theirs are thinner than the 769's.... Thanks again for any input/info!",

They have 3 locations, one in two local hospitals and then the storefront location which is the one I went to. I first went to the one of the hospital ones because it's close to where I live, but was completely turned off by their space (it felt like an overgrown closet) and the saleswoman/fitter who worked there. Their other hospital location is about 40 miles away and not at all convenient to get to. So I went to their storefront location which at least is a normal size, and not too far way (about 20 miles). But that's the sum total of the in-person boutiques where I live. The funny part is that the original bra she tried on me was a 34B and I thought it was fine cupwise but the fitter kept insisting that the Size 4 form was too small because the outside of the cup \"should not have any wrinkles in it\" after the form was inserted, because the wrinkles would be visible under my tops. I kept telling her I didn't care about that but she insisted on ordering in the A cup #769 instead, which she didn't have in stock at the time. When I went back to get those she said that it was now \"correct\" (that the bra cup fit 100% tightly over the form). I did ask whether the form ends should stick out so much but she said they are \"all like that\". Apparantly not, and I thank you for the tip! I just started a new thread about forms because I am really questioning the so-called necessity for the silicone ones for me. I'm now also questioning my choice of bra, and am wondering if I should also say I want to exchange the A cup for the B cup that I originally tried on. I'm wondering too if the tightness overall would be a bit less with the B cup bra than with the A in that model?",

One thing I picked up is a sleeveless top with a fairly large \"soft pleat\" falling down from the neckline. It's dressier looking than something that is gathered uniformly all the way across, and the fabric is I'd say midway between casual and dressy and so could work for either. Colors are beige, chocolate brown, and aqua, with details in black; so it would go with any of those four colors in pants or skirt. It could be worn in warm weather by itself, and later on with a jacket or something over it. I don't have the means to post photos but the SKU number on the tag is 0799791, price $32.99 -- would be less if you happen to have coupons of course. The item name on my receipt is \"Safari Signal\".  I also bought a couple of 100% cotton button-down shirts, one in a grey/white pinstripe with 3/4 sleeves and a removeable self tie belt; very soft fabric, very comfy, kind of like a guy's shirt or painter's shirt but with shaping darts in the back. SKU #0806174, regular price $26.99, on sale for 30% off, so $18.89. Item name is \"3/4 Belted Stripe\". The other shirt is a bright vibrant funky kind of print (orange/turquoise/yellow but they have the same shirt in two other different prints and different color combos) that also has a button and an interior tab on the upper part of the sleeves, so you can roll the sleeves up from full wrist length to 1/3 length and they'll stay put. It looks really good with the front tied in a knot under the boob(less) area; poofs it out nicely and there's no flatness at all. Can also be worn full length for layering, because it (and the pinstripe one too) is very generous lengthwise. This shirt seems to run large; normally I'm a Medium but in this shirt that was way too big and I took a Small instead. SKU #0365478, regular price $29.99, on sale for 30% off so $20.99. Item name is \"RTB Button Multi\" in Orange. Yes, I was a Bad Girl that day. I even bought (*gasp!*) chocolate on the way home!!!    Which didn't even make it as far as my front door before being devoured, LOL !",

I'm not too surprised to hear about the problematic foob opening, given that the bra was designed for extremely-small-cupsize wearers; perhaps in the future they might redesign that part of it to make the bra more versatile, especially if they get some feedback from users like yourself. Having at first bought the Amoena 429 bra and quickly got fed up with the relatively small opening in that one (switched to the Anita Nastaja afterward) I can only imagine what a PITA an even smaller opening would be like!   Thanks for testing and reporting on the ZeeBra though!",

I am a 36 band also (to be comfortable) and use either a size 4 (A cup) or 5 (B cup) microbead form depending on what kind of top I would want to wear; a clingy top will get the size 4/A  form but under a bulkier/heavier top I'd choose the 5/B form. I wouldn't even try the Coobie until I no longer have my port though. I can tell from the photos that the straps would hit it. The only bra I found that is at all wearable with the port is the Anita Nastaja (because the straps are not only narrow but set more to the outside) and even then sometimes if I move my arm in certain ways the edge of the strap will contact my port, which makes me crazy.   Soft fabric touching the port is okay but I hate the feeling of anything more solid (like a seam, bra strap, etc) touching it.  One of the many reasons I much prefer going flat whenever possible, which is most of the time.",

But I'm happy to see that it works for many of you! I'm like Erica, VERY sensitive in the underarms since my BMX ... even to the point that several of my tops made from heavier fabrics (fleece, terrycloth, etc) are now unwearable because their underarm seams are \"too bulky\" for me to wear anymore! I've also given away a few summer tanktops because the underarms were cut too high for my post-BMX comfort (even when going flat) although they never bothered me before. I've learned that everything now needs to have a generous/low armhole area and have flat seams there to boot, otherwise it's too uncomfortable for me to wear. I also hate anything with an elastic band under the boobage area, but that's nothing new. Eliminates 90% of the camis out there. The one in the Target cami is so thin and loose that it doesn't bother me but anything either tighter or wider definitely would. I admit it, I'm just a FPPITA (Fuss-Pot Pain In the...    )  when  it comes to stuff worn next to my skin; would you believe I've always cut the neckline tags out of all my tops ever since I was a teenager?!   \"The Princess And the Pea\" had nothin' on moi, LOL!",

Oh I definitely hear you about even pre-BMX bra-shopping frustration! Three things I have always hated having to shop for: (1) Bras (2) Shoes (my feet are wide across the toes area, narrow in the heel, have a high arch, and are supersensitive) and (3) Jeans/Pants (I have a fairly slim waist and not too large hips, but am \"longwaisted\" and so any pants that fit properly in the waist/hips are too tight YouKnowWhere; any pants that fit comfortably there, practically fall off my butt!

Although the straps look thin (which is great) the top edge of the cups sections looks like it goes up pretty high. The mastectomy bra I bought (see my post about \"workable solution for bra/port conflict\") is the Classique #769 but as I explained in that post, that strap still hits the side of my port which makes it too uncomfortable for me to wear. I like the straps on the Still You, but the other issue is that if the cup part is too \"high\" (the top edge of the Classique front JUST barely touches the lower edge of my port) that would hurt also. Do you know if the top edge of a 34A Still You bra comes up higher than the top edge of a 34A Classique 769? I have the removable fiberfill forms from the Amoena Hannah post-surgical cami that I could put into the Still You bra; I'm just looking for a couple of appropriate bulges underneath out-in-public spring and summer tops, is all. After my port comes out in a year or so, I'll be able to wear the Classique but unfortunately not until then because it's just not worth the discomfort vis-a-vis the port area.

I called my local mastectomy shop and asked about the Classique 740; the gal there said that was one of the bras she'd given me to try on during my fitting and I didn't like it. After she mentioned it I did recall her bringing out another Classique model and looking at the 740 picture again I realized she was 100% right about that. I probably tried on a half dozen bras that day and the 769 was the only one that felt comfortable on me, although I'm not crazy about the snug fit... she said I \"absolutely need\" a 34 even though after wearing a 36 for the past several years the 34 feels constricting. But she insisted that what I found \"comfortable\" was not the proper fit for a mastectomy bra which must not only fit very snug around the chest but the breastforms must also fit tightly into the bra pockets. That's how I ended up with an Amoena size 4 form and a 34A Classique 769 bra. I really like that Nastaja #5362 you linked to!! The straps are definitely narrower than the Classique 769 and it looks as though the cup shape might work too. If the bottom \"band\" area is as stretchy and comfortable as the 769, it might be perfect. I think I'm going to order one and cross fingers that the fit is as good as it looks on the photo... looks like it's cut low under the arms too, which is another plus. And it's on sale now too! Thanks so much for your help!",

I had to stop wearing the Amoena Hannah post-surgical camisole because my skin was reacting to the Aloe and Vitamin E that's in their fabric, and now I just wear a longsleeve or short-sleeve 100% cotton voile button-down shirt next to my skin and under a cardigan (it's still chilly where I live). The fitter was really obsessive about the breastform having to fit into the bra cup 100% completely so that there are absolutely no wrinkles that might show under my clothes. I did tell her that 95% of my tops are prints, not solids, and that I really do not care one bit if my apparent boobs/bra isn't a 100% smooth surface... but she kept saying that it's all part of getting the proper fit without the forms moving around or the back riding up. I was always midway between and A and a B cup but when I tried a \"B\" form, it looked too big for me ... so I went with the A. But I will admit that when I did wear a 36 bra, which felt comfortable on me, they always rode up in the back and I wondered why! Ooopsy. After all the back-and-forth about the \"proper fit\" (me saying I didn't like the tightness and her saying that anything looser would be the wrong fit) I ended up taking the 34 bra and mentally deciding that if I get really annoyed with the fit I will just buy a pair of those bra-extenders to convert it to a 36! It just wasn't worth the hassle, especially since they are the only mastectomy boutique where I live (they have 3 locations but it's all the same company) and the department stores either don't carry mastectomy bras or they just have regular salesclerks who are clueless about them. You mentioned not having to squeeze the form into the bra pocket, so I have a silly question: Is it \"normal\" for some of the outer (underarm) part of the breastform's triangle to stick out of the pocket opening, even though the rest of the form is in its proper place? Because that's how they end up when put inside my 769. Just curious, because from a comfort point of view I would think that having fabric between every part of the silicone surface and one's skin would be optimal, but maybe that's the way all pockets are designed?",

If you are small-breasted and don't need a lot of weight to balance things out, and can afford the $40, my vote would be for the microbead one because it's by far the most comfortable IMHO. Also your insurance would cover the purchase of a foob but I don't know if all policies cover prosthetics rentals. I'm sure that even if insurance did cover a rental they'd require a doctor's Rx for it.",

If the surgical area is going to be at all sensitive during the process I would absolutely go for the microbead foob.  TLC has the lowest price on the microbead foobs, at $40. The foobs are made by Sililque even though TLC does not identify them as such. Normally I do not buy from TLC for other reasons but in this case I would recommend them as a source because you can save anywhere from $10 to $25 on this item compared to the other sites that sell these.

I developed plantar fasciitis in one foot about a year ago and now have to wear orthotics, which complicates the shoe-shopping thing even more.  For summer casual wear I have a pair of Dexter boat shoes that are 17 years old, I kid you not. They are only now really showing their age. They're the original Dexters that were made in Maine by them; the current Dexter brand is owned by some other mega-company and is nothing but made-in-China **** that fits nothing like the originals did.

I had a BMX (one prophy) in February. I never had a moment's doubt or hesitation about absolutely NOT wanting recon. Had no desire for anything, either artificial or biologic, to be implanted in my body -- and I certainly did NOT want to have additional surgery! All I wanted was \"one (visit to the OR) and done\", LOL! I expected to be upset post-surgery at how my chest looked, but surprisingly I was not. The scars will fade with time but honestly after the first month or two I don't even 'register' looking at my chest. In fact, as crazy as it may sound, being flat-chested makes me feel more youthful ... not that I had a lot to begin with, being a 34 almost-a-B! .. because this is the way I looked before I hit puberty, after all!     And again it may seem crazy but I am relieved that in another 20 years when I'm 80-something, I won't be looking at what advanced age and gravity does to boobs and thinking \"ugh!\".  I also discovered during this past brutally hot summer that being boobless is a LOT more comfortable, heat and humidity-wise! I truly hardly ever sweated, even when the temps were in the mid to high 90s. Men have no idea how good they have it in hot weather, LOL. As far as foobs go, I rarely wear mine because I'm far more comfortable going flat. When I do wear them I use the microbead ones. I have one \"good\" pair of Silique Comfort-Lites which will literally last forever because if I put them on once or twice a year for a special occasion that'll be a lot. I'm a casual gal who lives in jeans and tee-tops and no makeup, so I rarely dress up anyhow. My feeling is, What's not to like about no-recon?   I had an overnight surgery with no pain and no aftereffects/problems; I can be whatever bust size I want (via foobs) or choose the ultra-comfy flat \"Twiggy look\"; as far as body-image goes, I feel younger and the specter of being 'saggy' in my old age is gone; I'm much more comfy now in hot weather; breast self-exams are a snap because it's almost imposible to miss something when you're flat   ; and let us not forget:  no more mammos!",

Ironically, I used to avoid button-down cotton shirts because of the gapping, but now that I'm flat I love them: Not only are they great for subtly camoflaging flatness (you can poof them out a bit and they'll stay that way) but I can really appreciate the comfortable-ness of the fabric itself.",

      "Content": "Nov 7, 2010 10:56PM - edited Nov 7, 2010 10:58PM by lovemygarden FWIW, my BS gave me a green-light for getting foobs about 3 weeks after surgery; I'd healed nicely,had no swelling, pain, or other issues. Of course, that began my months-long learning experience (hmmm, maybe we all should collaborate on a handbook entitled \"Foobs for Dummies: Everything You Never Realized You Never Knew About Breast Prostheses\"  ) which ended in the great revelation, i.e., that I much prefer going flat! As otter and Lisa mentioned, I too didn't quite have my head on straight when I went for the mastectomy-shop appointments. Way too easily cowed/swayed into getting something that in my gut I had doubts about in several respects. Luckily I was able to rectify what would have been an extremely expensive lapse in common sense (since I have no insurance to pay for foobs). Mouser, IMO buying online has a great advantage because the entire \"foob marketplace\" is at your disposal, whereas I don't think any one mastectomy source -- be it a specialty shop/boutique or Nordstroms -- carries all the brands. So you're really at the mercy of the store's owner or buyer as far as what you CAN see and try on, unless you're able to drive from store to store to store until you've checked out every brand that's out there. For instance the shop I went to, which operates 3 locations (two of which are in  hospitals) only carries Amoena. A friend recently told me of a new, differently owned shop which she went to, and I asked her what brands they carry: Airway, TrueLife, and Classique. They don't carry Amoena at all. From what I'm reading here, Nordstroms carries only Amoena. And most importantly, as far as I know, no brick-and-mortar stores carry Silique, which IMHO is the best line of all. It's online-only (though there are several choices of who to buy through). To be honest, I don't see how buying a foob online is any different from buying clothes or shoes online: You use their size chart to make your best choice of sizing if you don't already know it, read the description to see the material(s) it's made of, order it, try it on when you get it, and if it's not quite right, either exchange or return it. The only major difference is that there's usually a 7-day return/exchange period for foobs, whereas with other online purchases 30 days seems to be the norm. I've bought/returned/exchanged far more pairs of shoes online (since I'm a hard to find width in stores) than I can remember -- and am still doing it! I can never find what I'm looking for in the stores....",

Here's a crazy thought I just had: If the bottom of one of these camis were cut off just below where the \"pockets\" are, would it serve as a lightweight non-binding no-extra-layer alternative to a bra? Or would the front shift around too much? Hmmmmm......................",

      "Content": "Jun 12, 2010 05:08PM - edited Jun 13, 2010 02:04PM by lovemygarden Dawn, I  can totally relate to the whole \"right/wrong foob size\" thing! Pre-BMX, I was midway between an A and B cup ... always wore the I Can't Believe It Fits bras, by Playtex, in a \"Nearly B\" cup which were perfect. I love having the beanie-foobs in both the size 4 (A cup) and size 5 (B cup), because now I can customize my boobage .. er, foobage   ... to the type of top I'm wearing. The knit t-tops that I love look best (IMO) with the size 4 beanie, because those tops are more clingy. With my looser tops and later on my heavier sweaters, the size 4 doesn't project enough to be noticeable. so the size 5 beanie looks best with those --- gives the same effect as the size 4 does with the thinner tops. I used to do the same thing with bras, before BC  ... wore either the contoured one or the light fiberfill one, depending on the top. Some things never change!  Edited to add: My one teeeeny complaint about the Target crossover cami (size M) is that I wish the adjustable part of the straps was their full length, or at least a longer section than it is, because even with the straps as short as they can possibly go, I'd prefer it if my foobs could be just a little bit higher.  This is something I'm 100% sure that nobody but me would  notice, and ironically the foob placement right now is ideal for my port  because the top of the cami hits just under it and doesn't touch it at all (I hate hate hate anything 'solid' touching the port area). But after the port comes out next summer I would love to be able to lift the foobs a tiny bit higher, so I may break out the needle and thread and shorten the straps a little more that way. However, while I still have the port the foob placement with the shortest strap position is perfect.",

      "Content": "Jun 19, 2010 11:18AM - edited Jun 19, 2010 11:22AM by lovemygarden I received the Cool Comfort Cami from TLC today and here's my \"review\". I got the Beige in size Medium. PROs: * The fabric is very soft and comfortable. * The breastform pockets and pocket openings are HUGE.. my size 5 microbead form fit with plenty of room. You could fit a 6 or 7 form into these pockets, I'm sure.  MAYBE GOOD/MAYBE BAD: * There is a wide elastic band under the pockets only (does not go all the way around) but in the size M cami it is not tight on me (I weigh 110 lbs); good since I hate anything that feels snug or constricting. In fact it, and the front itself, is quite loose which brings up the: CONs: * There is so much room in the front that the cami top edge (which is lace trimmed) gaps open noticeably. Looks very sloppy. * Those oversize pockets allow even the microbead form to \"droop\" noticeably too. * The straps are not adjustable for their full length, only for what IMHO is a too-short section in the back. * The color of the lace trim on the beige cami doesn't even remotely match the body! The body is medium beige but the lace trim is a sort of sage-greeny color (think \"faded camo\"). Ugh.  * Overall the cami is cut too big in the front (IMO) but too skimpy across the back. That's why I am returning it instead of exchanging it for a size Small ... I know the back would be annoyingly tight because it almost is with the size M. When I tried shortening the straps more, the top front gapped even more and the armholes became too high for my comfort. Of course YMMV, but overall I'd say this cami is a poor cut/design. It's made in China, what else is new....? Oh well, more return postage!",

Keep in mind that they are so malleable that unless you need them to be wider than 6\", you do have \"wiggle room\" (literally!) when it comes to bra/cami pockets.  Erica, I bought mine before TLC carried them also, and mine have the external seam like yours, but I haven't had any show-through issues. Haven't received the ones I just ordered from TLC yet.  By the way, I asked Silique if it's okay to just leave these forms in a bra or cami (unlike anything with silicone which needs to be stored in a shaped thingy whenever not worn); they said it should be fine. Works perfect for me because I am definitely a \"grab-and-go dresser\"; so if I decide the cami feels too hot under a given top, I can just grab the bra instead without having to remove the foobs from one and put them into the other!",

      "Content": "Jun 5, 2010 12:00AM - edited Jun 8, 2010 09:48AM by lovemygarden I found these same camis in white about a month or so ago and ordered 6 of them online to make sure I'd have a \"stash\" in case they sold out or got discontinued! They are perfect for the microbead forms (and I am a bilateral). I have the Silique 1st Choice, bought from Hidden Beauty Plus at $60 each in specific sizes; I'll be irked if the TLC one is $20 less for the same thing! I bought my microbeads in 2 sizes, a 4 and also a 5 so that I can customize my foob-age to whatever top I choose to wear (although I am most comfortable going flat, it's great to have multiple options!). I find that the pocket opening in the Size medium Target cami easily takes a size 4 microbead form; the size 5 just makes it through also, but I doubt a 6 would fit into it. They don't slide up at all, btw.  btw, I hadn't seen the camis in Beige online at all; do they have them (the crossover one) in beige in the stores? Online only offers white, black, and (ugh) fuchsia....  Edited to add: I just compared prices for the Silique Comfort-Lite at TLC, TrueKare, and Hidden Beauty Plus; TLC is the most expensive, at $159 each. Hidden Beauty charges $112 each. TrueKare is $110 each or $212 if you order two. I'm going to email Silique and ask them if the microbead form that TLC is selling for $40 is their product also.",

The brand is Fairfield Poly-fil Microbeads. The only downside is that they are sold only in a fairly large (20-oz) bag but you could always make other things like pillows, headrests, computer/mouse wrist rests with them too! The bag costs about $20 but Jo-Ann Stores always have coupons for 40% or 50% off....  Edit: Sorry, I just realized that you are looking for polyurethane beads, not polystyrene... the Fairfield ones are polystyrene.  I wonder if it makes a difference though? The main difference seems to be when they are used for insulation: http://www.sunsationalgreen.com/?page_id=47",
