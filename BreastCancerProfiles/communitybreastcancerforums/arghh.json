I also have to say, having started to read posts on this site, please don't automatically put your life on hold. Maybe you can do what my friend did, use your nursing background and dx to reach out to others at some future point? I think there are also condition-specific forums that you could get help from, and read about others with your dx.",

I feel like a wimp, like everyone else gets a biopsy and returns to work the same day... Luckily, they will do a repeat ultrasound first, then I will have the biopsy right away if it is not a cyst. I bought a few front closure bras, but they are so springy, I might have to use less springy back clasp bras - I'm not 100% sure of the location, they said inner but top or bottom isn't clear. Never felt a lump. Having a steak tonight as preparation for the biopsy tomorrow...",

      "Content": "arghh wrote: I've had equivocal scans for the past 10 years, and now I have two medical opinions that I need a biopsy. It's rather weird, because I had fibrocystic breasts around my 20s, was told that I had dense tissue for many years, and now am told I don't have dense breast tissue, but there is an area of concern. I have an illness that is like MS and also have fibromyalgia, and have not been feeling great including arm pain. I do work full-time at the moment with accommodations. I'm sure general questions about biopsies and recovery time have been asked, but I am wondering if anyone with other medical conditions, especially a neuromuscular disease, has had to take extra time off after a biopsy. My current plan is to take off a week after the surgery, but my recovery time from any sort of injury is usually more than that. I also teach, so I have to write on the board so any arm issues are magnified. Thank you in advance for any thoughts anyone might have. Log in to post a reply",

I took your advice on the valium - I had almost forgot! It helped because I ended up waiting a long time after the pre-biopsy ultrasound. I think it helped with the pain after as well, but I am icing frequently. I brought two different bras, but they ended up giving me one. I am not sure if that is what they always do post-biopsy. I have to say the folks who helped me were very good; I got a towel for under my neck, the doctor adjusted the heat in the room for me. I had an ultrasound-guided biopsy, and I was glad I didn't have to have a stereo. I ended up having glue because I tend to bleed a lot, after I've had non-cancer related biopsies. The doctor took like five samples, if I remember correctly. Yet she did say it was probably benign. I have a long history of taking birth control pills so I am at a higher risk than some women.",

Nine of those weeks were messing around with a local group that says they \"are\" affiliated with a big name cancer center, but that's a lie. Went to a different big name cancer center, they reviewed my scans in a week, then saw me in a week, then a week later took the biopsy. It is very good to have speed - maybe it is a bad sign, but I can't get those 6 weeks of messing around back if it is serious... I think they took 5 samples from mine too. The biopsy was a weird experience, like not a surgery but sort of a surgery because everyone was in scrubs and it was really quiet.",
