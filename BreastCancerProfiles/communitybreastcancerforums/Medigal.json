So he thinks I am a nutcase.  Who cares!!  He is not the one who has to live with my fears.  I also don't think I would still be surviving if a \"caring\" doc several years ago had not given me a tranquilizer RX and taught me how to take it without getting addicted to it.  If you don't get your answer soon, you might want to do what I do.  It amazes me how these doctors can be so good at their professions yet so terrible when it comes to understanding the feelings of their patients. You have to confront them and let them know it is too upsetting for you when you have to wait on results.  Being this upset is also not good if you have blood pressure problems.  Best of luck to you and many hugs!",

Not too long ago they had to do that to me because they were uncertain of what they were seeing on the films and it turned out to be just benign calcifications.  Maybe it will be the same for you.Let's hope so!",

It is aggravating for you but if you did not have a concern, I don't think you would be wanting a 2nd opinion.  Call them and try to see if they can reschedule you for a time and day you can make it.",

This is an important decision for someone to make and what was right for me may not be right for you.  I would be sure to get a second opinion before I opted for surgery.  Now my problem was many years ago and maybe they have found a way to make shoulder surgery less of a problem.  Just question the surgeon about resulting scar tissue pain and other possible complications from any surgery if you opt for it, imo.",

I was once informed by a very \"bright\" man that after all of his research on bc even women who went the entire 9 yards (bi-lateral Masts etc.) could not positively be protected because of that \"one\" evil, dangerous, rogue cell which may be roaming in the body and return at some time (no one knows when) and bring the \"curse\" back again.  I have always wondered why my surgeon refused to do as I requested and remove the entire right breast and anything else he needed to to save my life.  Maybe he realized that doing that was not going to \"probably\" protect me as well as just doing the lumpectomy and removing the 27 nodes of which one was positive.  He then hit me with weeks of Chemo and Radiation.  But I was willing to do the Chemo and Rads and then start the Arimidex.  I read about women who let their fear take control of them and they refuse to follow up with the treatments they need.  Too bad we don't have the statistics for all of these different sets of women and what their survival rates were and what their diagnosis, treatments etc. were and if they did or did not do the treatment.   When and \"if\" they ever find the right way to send something through our bodies which will target \"every\" cancer cell possibly roaming in our bodies, then they will have cured cancer!  The concern is how potent the treatment would have to be to do this and what would it do to the rest of our insides or outsides.   Just wondering.",

However, as I wrote earlier, it is up to how one wants to interpret being a survivor and if your Onc follows the same theory as my Onc does.  So.....I guess I am still not a survivor until I can be at peace that it may never return again.",

It's not as easy as you may think so if this is what you feel you need, in my opinion, I would call the social worker first thing tomorrow (Monday).  Best of luck to you!",

I think my questions were of a concern to get to the bottom of why she isn't being helped so that she could get the help she needs. What selfish motive could I have for wanting Irina to be helped?? Your question and post confuses me.  How much help have you offered to Irina?  If you have it would never occur to me that it would be from selfish motives.  BTW, I resent your insinuating I was telling Irina she couldn't vent, spew, whine, complain etc. on this forum.  You seem to be misreading everything I posted.  My request to Irina for answers was only to see if we could get to the bottom of her denials so she could get the help she says she needs.  Sorry you read into my post such cruel statements.  They are only in your head.  Not in my post to Irina.   Welcome to our group!  It is so nice we can be so honest with one another.  But bc does that to one.  It makes us real honest!",

I am not on Medicaid but I know how it has always worked for people I tried to help. This will take a lot of stress off of you and \"you\" will still be able to make the decision if you want the nursing home the Medicaid worker offers to you. Like Deanna wrote, if you want one closer to your daughter or oncologist, tell her this when you speak to her.  As I have said repeatedly, the nursing homes only have to allow a small number of beds for Medicaid patients so one has to be found that has a Medicaid bed available in the area you prefer. Let us know how you make out but call the Medicaid office as soon as you can.",
