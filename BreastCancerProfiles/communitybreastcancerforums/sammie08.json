Just checking in again before my Dec 1 appoint.I know I read over and over on here that the waiting is the hardest.Well it certainly is.I don't know if my imagination has gotten the best of me ......I don't really sleep because I am so worried and I don't know if I am dreaming up more symtoms or if it is something more to be worried about. I'm starting to feel achey in and around the breast that has the lump,and this kind thobbing griggly(sp?)(like the stomach griggles) on the lump. My husband felt the lump again last night(I feel a dull pain when the lump is pressed on) and he says it feels fiborious and like chicken breast.When I feel it I just get confused. Like I've said I already stuggle with anxiety and I do believe it is pretty powerful and might be making me fell some imaginary things but I don't know for sure.I really wish I could get in sooner it is so frustarating. Any thoughts at this point are welcome,thank you :-)",

I have I bilatiral mammo and US tommarow and I am very scared.I'm mainly scared now because of this on and off pain I am feeling where I've felt a lump.The pain has gotten worse and it no longer seems to be related to my cycle. It is like a tingling almost burning pain in that part of my right breast when touched  or or pressure is put on it. I know I'll probably have some answers soon enough. You ladies on here are so positive and supportive on this board.Any input on this update would be so apperciated on this day before my first mammo/US .

I have VERY questionable health insurance and I can't get in the see a doctor until January.I'm also terrified to go to the doctor as I don't have a regular doctor and have no idea who is good or who I can trust.I have paralazing anxiety about going to a doctor. Here is my worry.I noticed a lump in my right breast about 2 months ago but it seemed to go away after my cycle.Now towards the end of my last cycle(a week ago) I started noticing it again.It is still here but doesn't seem to be as big as it was two months ago.I've been doing research online and one site mentioned that it could be danger if the blood vessels are more pronounced on one breast(more than the other) and the vessels on my right are somewhat more pronounced on my right side.I've also read about puckering and skin looking like a orange.I'm confused about this I suppose that when I'm cold they do look kinda strange but my husband dosn't think so.My nipples don't go inward and I have no discharge. Should I be this worried?If I do indeed have puckering orange peel looking areola and it is cancer,how far along could it be?It always says that symptoms such as this don't show up until the cancer is more advanced.How adavanced?I feel doomed I'm so scared!Any words of comfort from anyone?Thank you in advance Log in to post a reply",

The doctor said that nothing looked worrisome at all,I have some small cysts and to come back in a year for an annual mammo.The negative results will be sent to my primary. I am in shock with happiness,I couldn't even ask the questions that I needed to ask.I expected at least a few complications.I will ask my primary those questions about my report. Thank you all for all the support and encouragement to get this checked!Hugs and blessings to everyone!",
