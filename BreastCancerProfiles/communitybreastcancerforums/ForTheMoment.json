I finally got scheduled for all my scans at my new cancer treatment center here in Iowa.  The good news is I have them all scheduled for the same day (Brain, PET, Chest) and will even get the results the same day while at the clinic! That is the best part.  I am so happy I won't have to deal with the waiting.  The bad news is, they can't get me in until next Friday.  A week from tomorrow!  That is the only time they could get me in for all the scans, and to see the doc on the same day.  So that means, by the time I actually see my doc and get a new plan, I will have missed 3 1/2 weeks of chemo.  Yikes!!! They seem to think that is ok, but it sure makes me nervous.  Tell me the chemo break is ok and just to enjoy it.  I'm making myself crazy worrying about what might be happening while we wait.

Anyway, I start new treatment today. Gemzar and Navelbine, two weeks on, one week off. They don't want me to go to England. Said if I take the time off to do that, things could get out of control pretty quickly. I hate this!! I'm so sick of not getting to \"live\" the way we want, when we want. Very frustrating. Also scared about how quickly they wanted me in, etc. Maybe things are a little more out of control than I wanted to admit. Feeling a bit uneasy today all.

Before I got pregnant, and was told I had cancer, I worked full time as an Operations Manager in a great multi-million dollar company. It was a great job and I took one heck of pay cut to stay home with my daughter. My boss gave me the opportunity to do that, because I had cancer, and was pregnant. Now however, they just called and would like me to come back to the office (at least a few days a week) and maybe transition back into full time. I'm so very confused! Before I had my daughter and was diagnosed with cancer, I was quite the career woman. Since coming home, I've become quite the mommy and been ok with working part-time. Especially since being diagnosed at Stage IV. The thing is, sometimes I miss my job, the fat pay-check, and the adult conversations I used to have. (rather than playing peek a boo and asking my daughter if she has to go potty all day.. ) My health right now is very good, but do I want to wait until it starts to fail to come home? I am getting such quality time with my daughter, and working from home allows me to travel to see family when I want, etc. They just completely rail-roaded me this morning. I don't even know is staying home is going to be an option. I told them to let me know by Monday what my salary would be and that I would contact some day cares in the area, etc. Yikes... so this is not exactly cancer related, but I came to my \"cancer family\" to vent. What does everyone think?? How many of you still work? Would you stay home, or work, if it was up to you??? HELP!!! I used to be good at making decisions. It is either chemo-brain, or my mind is full of all the daily things of dealing with cancer, that it can't find room to think clearly it seems. Thanks in advance for any thoughts...

      "Content": "ForTheMoment wrote: Hi all... as most of you know, I got knocked on my arse last week with Gemzar, Navelbine, Avastin and Zometa and was pretty sick for a few days. Now I know why!! I met with my onc today before receiving treatment. He said he totally expected me to end up in the hospital over the weekend. They had given me strict orders to get to the ER if I declined over the weekend, but didn't let on how serious it was. Guess the nurses didn't really know what the onc had on the back of his mind. Turns out.. there has been some research that people with liver disease may have an adverse reaction to chemo. To the tune of shutting the liver down. Apparently it attacks those cancer cells so harshly that the liver sometimes cannot recover, causing the high fever, and eventual liver shut down. Yikes!! He was very worried as my white blood cell count dropped down to very dangerous levels in just one day. Soooo.... my counts are slowly getting back to where they need to be, my fever has finally stabalized at around 100 and I am starting to feel more human. They obviously took me off the gemzar and I am now getting navelbine alone.. (of course with the avastin, lupron and Zometa). Just thought I would share with all. Apparently gemzar is perfectly safe for a lot of people with liver disease, but there is enough evidence that it can be very dangerous if the person has a strong reaction, that he felt the need to pull me off it immediately and check my counts every day for four days. Kind of scary, but sure am glad my onc seems to be on the ball! He is amazing! So, I went from three and a half hours of chemo last week, to 10 minutes this week. Sure hope the navelbine can do the job alone! Thanks for all your well wishes and prayers last week. Really appreciate it!! Love and hugs.. Erin Log in to post a reply",

Meat and potatoe pie with a crust. Bacon barms/butties with HP brown sauce. Steak with roast & new potatoes, gravy, mushrooms and Onions. Profiterolls with cream, chips, peas, pudding and gravy from the local chippy....Oh and we went to a sportsmans dinner on Friday and I got a kebab on the way home...lovely :-)   We played a rotten trick on mum & dad. We arrived on Saturday and Derek & Anne collected us from the airport, Derek was having a belated house warming on Sunday so all the family was at his house. Kayleigh and I came to the house and called on the phone from outside. I spoke to Derek a while and then asked to speak to mum, told her we had booked a flight and were coming early in June. She was so happy and was already crying on the phone. Then we walked in while still on the phone.... needless to say there were a lot of tears. Last time mum & dad saw Kayleigh she was just a few months old and barely rolling around.   We have been here just over 1 week and it feels like longer, but then again it will pass much quicker than I want it too. Kayleigh is having fun, being spoiled by Nan & Grandad and all her aunties & uncle.  Being back here, in my house is also a little strange Lorraine has done a nice job with the decorating but my room is pretty much as I left it. Makes me a little sad too, the last memories I have of being here was when Erin came for Xmas and I remember how excited she was to meet my family and spend some time in England. She was real sick with a cold that 10 days, but we made the most of it and did Yaeger shots every night (just to fight the germs).   Kayleigh is loving having stairs, she is up and down them every opportunity she gets. Though she is struggling with the concept of up and down, when she is down she points and says \"downstairs\" and when she is up, visa versa. Kayleigh is also enjoying going outside in the over grown garden. It has been real nice this week 70's all week, which is nice. I didnt want her memories of England to be (\"where the sky is low and it rains all the time\").   Today is a big day, it is the last day of the English football season and Manchester United need to win to ensure they retain thier title. We are going to uncle Derek's to watch it and Kayleighs has a new shirt just for the occassion. (They better win).   Tuesday 13th May 2008   .... And they did, still have to play Chelsea in the champions league final on the 21st to do the big double, sir Alex Ferguson (i am sure you all know who that is, if not google it...) has just been named manager of the year.   The weather is still looking good.... keeping fingers crossed..... Kales has been out to the local parks, with Nan & Grandad and went to Chester zoo yesterday with Derek and Anne (brought back a tiger, no clue where I am going to keep it, its actually a balloon tiger)...but still takes up room... Kayleigh has been to the park today with her gt cousin kian and auntie Caroline and cousin Deb.   I think thats all for now... Here are some piccys...   http://cards.webshots.com/invite/pickup/140563324ShMO/album/563392164uDHNAI   http://cards.webshots.com/invite/pickup/140563325pXMf/album/563402454OSvCtW  Wishing the best for all you wonderful ladies...
