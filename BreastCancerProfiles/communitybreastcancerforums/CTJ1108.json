Also I'm having a bloating issue, which is strange - I see no articles about bloating and radiation. I can't eat as much at once. Look poochy! (or is it fat from stress eating since this lump initially detected??) Maybe related to inactivity. The other day had my first \"hit the wall\" feeling. I had run 3 errands the day before and paid for it. Luckily I telecommute as a college professor and don't have to deal with going into an office. I have found if I work with my feet up in a lounge chair and a lap desk, I fatigue less than if sitting upright at the desk! A hopefully helpful tip! Bedtime is coming earlier and earlier! Giving myself permission to rest is hard. ",

Didn't seem to be really like an infection, but put on Bactrim DS x 7 days and cortisone/antifungal cream. They also did a punch biopsy several days after treatment since it didn't seem to be responding. (Results of that pending) Anyway- this puts me off from finishing a week. Luckily I'm having only 4 weeks (20 total days) inclusive of a boost. Since I work from home, teaching online, I am able to use this end of semester gift of time (energy) to really get caught up a lot - so looking at silver linings always helps! Also- another silver lining- all genetic tests negative! A relief since I recently lost my mother to Pancreatic Cancer. ",

Since 20 days (4 wks) of tmt- that means I am 1/5 of the way done! My rad onc suggested using a cream called Udder cream 2-3 times a day. Works fine. I was supposed to start on Aug 2nd but had to wait a week because I got a very itchy and red rash on my L breast- which no one knew what it was. Punch biopsy was negative, some skin discoloration as it has gone away- so will see if going into radiation with that issue confounds side effects. Has anyone else gotten a mystery rash (before radiation of all things!). I go in for a 7:15am appt each day- which gets me up and out of the house early- and to work just in time! They also valet park- and my most therapeutic thing in my whole journey is this smiling and positive valet guy! What a gift! ",

So if you are starting and worried about the shoulder joint- if I can do it- you can do it! Not a problem!",
