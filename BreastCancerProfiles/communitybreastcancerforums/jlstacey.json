The waiting sucked. Distractions that were worked for me were friends, my family and doing whatever I wanted to! I felt it was a good time to indulge myself some. Go to the movies, read, do whatever is fun for you. Try to find something that will take your mind off things. What about volunteering at a shelter or soup kitchen? And of course, read on here. During the first 6 months of 2015, I spent MANY hours on here! I wish you luck and hope that everything is OK. Happy Holidays!  ",

My PT is post-mastectomy and it is for cording and to release tightness, and then she is sending me on to another facility to strengthen my upper body for my DIEP flap surgery in 8 weeks. If you think you are making the same progress you were making previously, then your sessions are probably right. Perhaps bring up your concerns with your PT. ",
