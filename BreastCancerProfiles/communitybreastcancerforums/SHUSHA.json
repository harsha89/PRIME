The radiation was painful as the skin tore so easily. if anyone has it ( make sure to speak to the radiation nurse in charge and they give something like novacain mixed with some cream which helps numb the pain and helps the healing process. I have completed 7/18 herceptin ( have a powere port - hate it everytime they pierce it - tho i use EMLA) When  I told my oncologist I had severe fatigue and dryness in my nose and with nose bleeds and almost every morning have post nasal drip and i have to gargle and bring out the dried mucus with blood. It is terrible. Also, i hate peanut butter or any dairy products as the smell still puts me off. does anyone have that. Otherwise i feel fine, and have started my exercise routine with my trainer and have a great appetitie. MY hair has come back thicke than ever and i am a platinum /dark hair person and people think it is cool as i am keeping up with the latest trend in hair style. I have to tel them that all i had to do for this thick hair and color is to get cancer / have chmo /lose all my hair / and then it comes back like this. No one believes that i have cancer and everyone compliments me on my skin which is better than ever and no wrinkles at all as i feel the herceptin has thinned my skin a great deal. I do not think about what i have , i only think about how i can make my life better and feel better so i tend not to talk about it as i feel we give life to something that we dont want as permanent residents in us.  Love reading all your posts and I mentioned to my oncologist about the many ladies who have similar problems with  fatigue and nose bleeds -  he dismissed me wiht a \"HERCEPTIN DOES not casue it\" . So i am really happy i came upon this site. thanks ladies and may we live and love for many years. The Juravinski Cancer centre i go to has a great team of professionals and the care they give is amazing. I take the relaxation treatments they give patients such as reflexology / reiki/ yoga. My friends and family esp my hubby was and is a gret support for me and without them i would be lost. I wish all of you had the same support as i have. I worked and work right through my treatment from home but cannot do much home work / chores like before as i am very tired and hurt a lot if i stand for long periods of time. I look fwd to better days  Cheers Usha Meister",
