She just had a mamogram and they found a cluster in her good breast. They removed it and what they had removed was pre-cancer. She starts another 6 weeks of radiation. Her doctor wants to also put her on tamoxifen. My Dad is freaking out! He was a total jerk the first time around and hates the doctors. He thinks they are all out to get his money. He has read the brochure for the tamoxifen over and over again. He talked my Mom out of taking it the first time around and her doctor is insiting on her taking it this time. My Dad only seems to really be reading the side effects portion of the brochures. My Dad is a very controlling person and there is nothing I can do when it comes to my Moms health and what she really needs to get well... She doesn't even seem to have any say in it. She loves him and won't go anywhere or do anything without him. What I need is some first hand imput on the drug tamoxifen.. someone who has taken it and not developed uterine cancer or any of the other major side effects that my Dad so believes my Mom is going to get from this drug. There is always a risk with any drug and he just doesn't seem to understand that.. I've tried to get him to read the back of an asprin bottle before he took 2 for a headache but he doesn't see it the same way! Someone please help. I need real people who have taken this drug, something I can print off to give my Dad so he can read real stories not 1 in a million studies! Log in to post a reply",
