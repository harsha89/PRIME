Forgot to mention that dr also said my uterus is the size of a ten week pregnancy, she's checking for fibroids and I need an endometrial biopsy. Not aa good week! If the radiologist says no biopsy is needed, should I ask for one for peace of mind, or maybe an MRI? My old report said breasts are heterogeneously dense. Thank you for listening. I just need to get this out and stop dumping on my poor husband.",
