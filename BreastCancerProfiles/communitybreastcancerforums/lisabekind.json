It was close to the surface, around my aerola. I had breast implants which may have pushed it closer to the surface. Also, no needle biopsy for me. The dr did not want to puncture my implant. So, the way my story rolls out is different than others. Also, I had a MRI after and saw nothing, looked good. Well, after my BMX, 3/13 node positive, idc found in breast not where original tumor was, along with DCIS present away from original tumor site. I had a mammogram April 2016, was all good . Dx- Dec 2016.",

That is something in the beginning I prayed about, because I knew that would happen. Empathy, humility is key here. Varadoll- you've been on my mind. God has his eye on you, you are very special. Prayers for your mom. Shellybeans, you got this! I think you have the beautiful horses. I'm sure that is a stress reliever, being around those beautiful horses. Animals are wonderful. I have 2 dogs and a cat. I'm gonna play monopoly with my 9 year old girl. My 12 year old son has a terrible cold. I pray I have many more years with my beautiful children. Love to all! Shellybeans- forgive me, you are probably not the one with the horses. I bet it's cowboy up, which would make sense. You just ran before surgery, I think??

The Dr did emphasize shoulder stiffness, so I've been moving them around. I'm a little sore middle of back, left side. That may be due to the hospital stay. I was getting on and off of the bed myself to go to the bathroom, I'd call the nurses, but no show. All in all not that bad. Not having strength in my arms, stinks. That should come in time.

My grandmother (on my mother's side) passed from bc, but all my genetics came back neg. I also have 1 kidney like my grandmother. So, I don't put much faith in the genetics crap. I had my surgery the 26th. I did not get expanders put in due to lymph node positive. That decision was per my ps, not all ps would go that direction. I now wait for my pathology report Friday. I've decided I would like to get a second pathology opinion, looking at John Hopkins. I'm in NC, the ball has been dropped to many times at my facility. I was told time and time again, it's small, your in good shape, yadda, yadda, yadda. Well, node positive, f'ers! I had implants prior to bc. You would think my boobs are important. They are not, it is survival now!! I will not lie, I look weird now. With what you said, I don't like 2 different diagnosis per the MRI. This board is great, you came to the right place. Go with you Gut. My surgery date below is wrong, and the info above says I'm getting a BMW. I have not changed...just.fyi...but I wish it was a bmw, not this life changer. One more thing, my team was pushing me toward a lupectomy. My gut told me no way",

About the node- about a week before my BMX, I noticed my node under my arm was very swollen ie: through this whole process had not been, and this was 3 weeks after complete removal of my tumor. I mentioned it to my BS the day of my BMX. His response, it's probably from the biopsy. Whatever! Well that node was positive, 7mm positive! I wish there would of been more clarity on that. And to top it off, the path report states that node was rather large probably due to a reaction to the dye. Well, that is incorrect. So, I will be calling pathology today, to have that revised.

I thought I was getting a sinus infection before my surgery. I only had headache with no other symptoms. Since your nose and throat/breathing are symptoms. I would call the anesthesia department today, and explain your situation. Call your bs also. I feel for you, because I was so worried before my surgery. So I was cruising the web. I do have a very sore throat, probably from the tube insertion, and I am phlegmy. My glands around my neck under my chin were very swollen, it has gotten better. I am on an antibiotic. This stinks that it's Sunday, and that you may have to postpone. Your health is upmost important before surgery, so CALL.",

I think I'm going to get a second opinion. I'm looking at either Duke or Wake. I'm going to check with my insurance on Monday.",
