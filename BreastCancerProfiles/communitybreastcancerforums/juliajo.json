Radiation is much more challenging than I thought it would be. The combination of going everyday, wondering what the effects (both good and bad) of radiation are or are going to be, and the actual side effects (burning, hurting, fatigue) are a force to be reckoned with. 2. Talking with all of you has been very helpful and the only real way I haven't felt alone in this. Thank you. 3. Having a sense of humor about it has helped me, giving the machine a name, (Max Rad) calling him my boyfriend and knowing exactly when I'm going to break up with him have given me and other people a way to talk about this. 4. Taking afternoons off from work and not putting the normal amount of extreme pressure on myself has helped.(In fact, I'm going to miss afternoons off). 5. Working has helped also. It distracts me from the disease, the treatments and the side effects and besides I like my work and the people there. 6. Playing with the creams and supplements has at least made me feel like I'm doing something. I'm not sure what, if anything, helped, but at least I was doing something. 7. Being willing to take medication when I needed it, antidepressants, pain medicine, anxiety medicine has really helped. 8. Having and making plans for what happens after all this is over has helped even if I'm not sure of how much stamina I will have. It means there is life after this and this routine isn't my real routine. 9. Owning my treatment has been important. There have been several times when I doubted the set of decisions I have made. Those have been my worst times. Then I read, talk to Drs, talk to you and recommit. 10. Trust myself, trust God, trust the Drs. trust other people. I would love to hear your thoughts.

If you get the burning I did, it feels like a very bad sunburn. Anything that added even mildly to that effect on your skin wouldn't be worth it. The radiation covers up to your collarbone and upper breast area, areas usually exposed when tanning. Good luck",

All I'm really saying is that you must do the best you can with the information you have and then try to go on without constantly double thinking yourself and everyone else. (I think)",

In some future situation there will always be room for doubt and regret, but that's our choice isn't it? Our treatments are all our choices given the alternatives. I bet if chemo was really wanted, they would give it. I feel worst when I can't own my treatments, which has happened a few times during rads as in why didn't I just have the poor thing taken off. I think I will be glad I didn't until the day I get this again (if I do). So, I think I will finish, do what I can, and then hopefully, hopefully relish, embrace, and love the life I have left.
