    "Content": "CalmMeDown wrote: Hello everyone... I first noticed drainage from my left Breast February 1st. The drainage is clear looking but on my clothing it appears tea stained. It is a spontaneous drainage. My last mammogram was in October 2015 and I have never had any issues. I called my PCP that week to get a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound scheduled. Those tests were done February 7th with no findings of anything wrong. I was scheduled for a galactogram on February 21st and the radiologist found a filling defect. The dye was not able to even go into the tree-root like ducts because of the blockage. I was shown the pictures and sure enough you could see a mass of some sort in the duct fully blocking it. He also found calcifications in the breast as well. BIRADS 4 and scheduled for a consultation with a breast specialist at Siteman Cancer Center in STL. The Appt is next week on Thursday. Any ideas or anyone ever have a total blockage that was not cancerous? Trying to stay calm but I'm not sleeping much. Log in to post a reply",
