I wish you the best of luck with surgery & quick recovery. I had 3 lumps removed on that same Thursday Feb 7th! Also two in my right & one in my left breast. I was told the same thing about unlikely to have BC in both breasts at the same time. well originally it was suppose to just be the stereotactic needle biopsy but breast surgeon decided to suck it all out while he was in there with that so called needle that looks more like a drill with a suction tube on it!!! they just did sono pics afterwards but put the titanium clips in to mark both sides.  my right wasn't too bad lil bruising & itching but more in fatty part of breast & easily felt under skin.  the left however was really deep & could not be felt but showed up when checking other side with mamo & sono (on Jan29) that gyno sent me for after confirming the lump (on Jan21) on the right i had found in November.  On the left - It's up higher & hurt really bad - almost passed out on table while it was being done since they only numb under the lump & he decided to suck it all out & not just take a biopsy...ugh! anyway probably should have had stiches on that side cause I bleed through all my bandages & bra & what a mess that night! first two days didn't look very bruised but very sore especially on left side. I was pale & tired too. but now I'm totally green & yellow on the left side & it still hurts when i try to pickup something from the incision all the way to my arm pit! tired of wearing a bra 24/7 ready to get strips off soon. Go back this Monday to BS for results & check incisions -he was on vaca all week :(  i felt around the right side this am & can still feel a small lump by area of incision but now there is a huge knot in my left breast where before there was none. Family history is my grandmother on my mom's side had BC in her 60s with mastectomy, my mom had it at age 41 with mastectomy, came back three years later on same side in breast tissue by collar bone very aggressive. Did chemo, stemcell transplant & radiation...she was gone in 8mos at age 45. soooo....I'm totally freaking out at this point. I will be 40 in May.  I know alot has changed in the past 15yrs but I am still worried, scared & I'm tired of waiting to get results!  ~Mom2-4Lil-Divas~ Tonya   ",
