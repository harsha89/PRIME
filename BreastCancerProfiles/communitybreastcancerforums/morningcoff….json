I forgot to mention my tumor is about 4.5, so maybe I'm over the limit to qualify for RFA? For SBRT, I was told that 5 cm is usually the cutoff. Sounds like RFA, in general, is effective. I will be sure to ask a lot of questions when I have my RFA consult.  Also, I will definitely contact Coolbreeze to ask about her experience with SBRT.   Thanks so much for letting me know about the \"Search\" tool - this should be very helpful. I am new to this site as well as technologically challenged. :)",

It's encouraging to know that SBRT has been well studied and that people seem to be doing well for 2 years and even beyond. Amazing to hear that the outliers have lived 7 years and beyond without recurrence. ",
