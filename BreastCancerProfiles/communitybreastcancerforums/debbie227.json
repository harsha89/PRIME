There is also what feels like small hard lumps at the top and bottom of the indentation. There is also what feels like a hardened vein?artery? going from my arm pit all the way down to the bottom of the breast. Breast also looks slightly larger/swollen at the bottom. Saw the gyne on Tues. Mammo and Ultrasound  yesterday showed nothing that they could biopsy and no thrombosis. Radiologist couldn't explain why I had the indentation or hardened vein.  She asked me if I recently lost weight....really? I wish. I'm 42, no family history of BC.   I'm waiting for the gyne to call when he gets results but of course, I am worried and wondering if  anyone has experienced this and what results were. I feel like something is wrong, but after leaving the breast center I just felt stupid and confused. Radiologist just said I should probably see a breast surgeon. Any guidance, experience, would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading this.",
