Except for one gesture of a follow up appointment, my bs has been out of the picture since my surgery. I also feel a little a drift now that I'm basically done seeing my ps. I said no to tamoxifen since I had DCIS so have never even seen an mo. I'll get annual mamos on the 'good' side. I'm assuming my bs will check my 'bad' side at 6 month follow up and give me further instructions then. Funny how the doctors keep you on a strictly need to know basis. Most of what I know about my follow up and 'now what' issues I have learned from these boards.",
