    "Content": "BeesHusband wrote: I am the husband of a 48yr old woman who has just been diagnosed with suspected 3rd stage Invasive Lobeular Breast Cnacer (ILC). 3rd stage because offsetting lymp nodes look \"funny\". Bonne Scan was given a clear and are waiting on a CT scan. We are meeting with the Oncology Team here in Calgary Alberta. We are also looking at getting a 2nd opinion on the \"traditional medical\" methods at a breast cancer clinic in the US. Any recommendations for clinics/doctors/oncology teams in the US?? We are also investigating and getting opinions on non-traditional methods (e.g. naturopathic) to compliment the standard Chemo/surgery/radiation. Open to all comments and suggestions.
