      "Content": "Dodes wrote: hello all! i hope it's ok if i tell my story, and if you don't want to read it (that's cool), my answers will be at the end of this. ;) in january 2017, i had my screening mammogram, then a diagnostic on my left breast, then a US , then a radiologist came in to do a more through US. he said initially he couldn't find anything, and didn't know what he was supposed to be looking for. then he 'magically' found something that he said was a lump. put my fingers on it, told me to keep a good eye on it over the next 6 months, and then told me (and i'm quoting here)- \"there's nothing to worry about tho, if it's not the size of a golf ball, it can't be cancer\". well. no. actually, we all know that's not true, but lying there, fully exposed to a man i didn't know, i felt at a disadvantage ;). he mentioned that he could do a biopsy, but it was in such a position that it wouldn't be worth it. (?) his official report mentioned nothing of the \"lump\" and recommended a 6 month follow up. he for reals said that, and then basically said it again as i was leaving.. he lost all credibility with me, but nobody seemed to care. fast forward to my GI's office. i have sclerosing mesenteritis, and sometimes tamoxifen is used as a treatment. When GI asked me how my last mammogram went, i told him, and he was like - yeah, that's not cool, i'm sending you to a breast surgeon. told me it would probably be at least a month or two before i got it. they called within a week of the referral , this past monday, actually. appointment wednesday. Breast surgeon walks in with my films and puts up the FIRST mammogram, and says \"do you see that? (pointing at some bright white thing on the film), that's not supposed to be there. i don't know if it's cancer or a radial scar, but you're having surgery one way or the other.\" i'm baffled that she was able to see something that no one else saw even in subsequent imaging. baffled, and if i admit it, kinda angry too. she felt me up, (sorry, i have a weird sense of humor) and decided that we needed to do a biopsy right then and there. so we did a core needle biopsy at 4 pm. (and it was on the opposite side of the breast as the \"lump\" that the radiologist 'found'. at noon on thursday, i got the call that it was cancer. idc. ok.... grade 1. sweet! but that's all the info i got. friday morning i gave blood for the genetic testing. will have a breast mri, and another mammogram (she put a clip in) before seeing her again on 8/2. mentally, i think i'm doing ok, a few moments of freak and panic, and then i remember that whatever's going to happen is going to happen. the \"c\" WORD scares me more than the actuality of it, if that makes any sense at all. SO, you crazy people who've read this far, and hello to those of you that just came to the bottom of the post (!) my questions are as follows- if it's grade 1, i shouldn't panic that it's been there since well before january, as it can't have grown/spread THAT much in 6 months, right? they were able to id and grade it in a few hours, how much longer should i expect to wait to hear about the hormone receptivity? can they \"stage\" from a core needle biopsy? i didn't think so, as they don't know how big it is, and where else it might be, but maybe the mri will give us that info? or will it not be staged until they remove \"it\"? ....and if that is the case, how will we be able to come to a plan of action as far a what surgery will be required? i guess i'm not sure of how much info the surgeon will be able to gleen from the next two imaging tests and genetic info. or do they perform surgery, and then decide a course of action? that part has me confuzzled, as i don't know what questions to be prepared to ask when i go back on the 2nd. tia for any and all responses. i'm sorry i have to be here, but i'm glad i found a place to \"be\". threaten me or my family, and i'll cut you out of my life... just ask my left breast....

      "Content": "Dodes wrote: hello all! i hope it's ok if i tell my story, and if you don't want to read it (that's cool), my answers will be at the end of this. ;) in january 2017, i had my screening mammogram, then a diagnostic on my left breast, then a US , then a radiologist came in to do a more through US. he said initially he couldn't find anything, and didn't know what he was supposed to be looking for. then he 'magically' found something that he said was a lump. put my fingers on it, told me to keep a good eye on it over the next 6 months, and then told me (and i'm quoting here)- \"there's nothing to worry about tho, if it's not the size of a golf ball, it can't be cancer\". well. no. actually, we all know that's not true, but lying there, fully exposed to a man i didn't know, i felt at a disadvantage ;). he mentioned that he could do a biopsy, but it was in such a position that it wouldn't be worth it. (?) his official report mentioned nothing of the \"lump\" and recommended a 6 month follow up. he for reals said that, and then basically said it again as i was leaving.. he lost all credibility with me, but nobody seemed to care. fast forward to my GI's office. i have sclerosing mesenteritis, and sometimes tamoxifen is used as a treatment. When GI asked me how my last mammogram went, i told him, and he was like - yeah, that's not cool, i'm sending you to a breast surgeon. told me it would probably be at least a month or two before i got it. they called within a week of the referral , this past monday, actually. appointment wednesday. Breast surgeon walks in with my films and puts up the FIRST mammogram, and says \"do you see that? (pointing at some bright white thing on the film), that's not supposed to be there. i don't know if it's cancer or a radial scar, but you're having surgery one way or the other.\" i'm baffled that she was able to see something that no one else saw even in subsequent imaging. baffled, and if i admit it, kinda angry too. she felt me up, (sorry, i have a weird sense of humor) and decided that we needed to do a biopsy right then and there. so we did a core needle biopsy at 4 pm. (and it was on the opposite side of the breast as the \"lump\" that the radiologist 'found'. at noon on thursday, i got the call that it was cancer. idc. ok.... grade 1. sweet! but that's all the info i got. friday morning i gave blood for the genetic testing. will have a breast mri, and another mammogram (she put a clip in) before seeing her again on 8/2. mentally, i think i'm doing ok, a few moments of freak and panic, and then i remember that whatever's going to happen is going to happen. the \"c\" WORD scares me more than the actuality of it, if that makes any sense at all. SO, you crazy people who've read this far, and hello to those of you that just came to the bottom of the post (!) my questions are as follows- if it's grade 1, i shouldn't panic that it's been there since well before january, as it can't have grown/spread THAT much in 6 months, right? they were able to id and grade it in a few hours, how much longer should i expect to wait to hear about the hormone receptivity? can they \"stage\" from a core needle biopsy? i didn't think so, as they don't know how big it is, and where else it might be, but maybe the mri will give us that info? or will it not be staged until they remove \"it\"? ....and if that is the case, how will we be able to come to a plan of action as far a what surgery will be required? i guess i'm not sure of how much info the surgeon will be able to gleen from the next two imaging tests and genetic info. or do they perform surgery, and then decide a course of action? that part has me confuzzled, as i don't know what questions to be prepared to ask when i go back on the 2nd. tia for any and all responses. i'm sorry i have to be here, but i'm glad i found a place to \"be\". threaten me or my family, and i'll cut you out of my life... just ask my left breast....
