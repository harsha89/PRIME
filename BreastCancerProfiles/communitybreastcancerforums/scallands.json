He stated that it 'looked' like a Fibroadenoma but because of my age (29) and the fact that their was only one he wanted more testing done.  OK?? I picked up a copy of the ultrasound and report so that I can bring it to the breast specialist I am scheduled to see Tues the 21st and this is what it reads.. \"Palpable solid vascular lobular density measuring 1.7 cm in maximal diameter.  There is moderate but not enhance through transmission and sharply defined margins.\" Ultrasound BIRADS 4, Suspicious abnormality If Fibroadenoma is begnin and should be classified a BIRADS 2-- why is this BIRADS 4 and should I be worried?

Good news is she is 'pretty' positive that the Lump I found is only a Fibrodenoma BUT she found another what she thinks is a Fibrodenoma AND a Lipoma... She did want to follow up with biopsy and I opted to just have all 3 lumps removed and then she can do all the testing she desires.. lol.. I dont want them there!  I am scheduled 10/30 for Surgery",
