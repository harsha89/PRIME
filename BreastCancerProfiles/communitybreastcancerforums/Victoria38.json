My LE does seem to be down over all a few percentages and less seems to come back when I do swell.  Since I started all these routines about the same time, it's hard to tell what is working, or it's the combo.  I had tried dry brushing years before but never stuck with it.  My brush was really harsh and uncomfortable.  Now of course I have the motivation to stick with it and I bought a softer brush.  I actually enjoy it now. (Especially on my peach fuzz head) The brush feels good and I feel like I am doing something to help my LE so it's easy to keep it up. I got a great deal on my brush on Amazon, as the price now went up almost $12.  It's the: Merben International Soft Texture Jute Body Brush with Cotton Cord Handle For Dry Use Only, 13\" Length",

That way it is easier to find for anyone looking rather than here. I'll work on that later today. As for the dry brushing; I too watched quite a few videos on You Tube.  I found many of them contradict each other. And yeah, some are so short and some are too long. And some of them seem to contradict principles of my MLD routine.  So I sort of modified and took what I thought was good from each of them.  Of course I brush from fingertips up arms and feet up legs. My back I brush mostly downward, but I can't reach well, so it's not consistently down, even with my long brush I have short arms and some weakness.  On my upper chest I brush across from left to right, because this is how I was taught to massage.  Same with my stomach, rather than up as most show, I brush toward my belly button, as that is how my massage goes. Since I then shower and immediately after do my MLD, I'm not so worried that I have precise drainage technique on the dry brushing.  Just basically getting it stimulated and moving is good.  I wouldn't say my technique is perfect, but it seems to be working and I'm ok with that.  I timed myself this morning and it was about 7 minutes.  Half way through I turn on the shower to get it warmed up. Since you have access to a therapist, I would ask her if she has recommendations, or make a list of the body areas and how you plan to brush and see if she feels anything is counterproductive. Do get a soft brush!  We have endured enough!",

      "Content": "Victoria38 wrote: So the statics say 1 in 3 may people develop Lymphedema after surgery to remove lymph nodes or after radiation.  I am here to say it is possible to get Lymphedema just from chemo alone.  My oncologist says in the 35 years he has been in practice he has never seen it before.  Yet here I am. My cancer story: I was diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer on May 30, 2012.  I had a very tiny mass on my left breast that had spread to a lymph node on the left side of my neck.  The neck mass was found first and began growing rapidly.  I started chemo on June 20th. Carboplatin, Taxotere along with Herception.  After my FIRST treatment the mass/lumps were responding and disappearing.  By the end of my treatment, they were gone completely as well as any traces, so completely that my PET scan was completely negative.  I had no mass or lump to remove or radiate.  I thank God for this miracle healing, along with the prayers of so many.   My Lymphedema:  Somewhere around my 3rd chemo treatment I began to feel a pulling sensation in my left upper arm when reaching up.  I would notice it and then it would go away, then return.  So that would be early August of 2012. I never mentioned it to my doctor, I didn't know it was related.  Towards the end of September 2012, I noticed my left forearm swelling.  I told the doctor, but he said it was probably a side effect of the Herceptin and wasn't concerned. Weekly it worsened and eventually started to swell in my hand and fingers.  Upon weekly visits for my treatments, he still didn't seem concerned.  On discussing it with his nurse, she told me there was a Lymphedema Clinic attached to the hospital and I should ask the doctor for a referral.  Well the doctor was on vacation that week and a fill in doctor saw me and did the referral.  She said that she believed that the chemo had \"fried\" my lymph nodes.  The chemo had been so aggressive targeting my cancer that it just destroyed the node/nodes as well.  Well I finally began treatment with a certified LE therapist the first week of November and continued for six weeks.  The usual gruelling schedule of 4-5 sessions a week and around the clock bandaging. I was very upset, and devastated to find that this may, and most likely will, be forever.  And no cure.  So at this time I have been out of therapy since December 6th. On my own, accountable for any swelling and in charge of my condition.  I began reading a lot on the web.  I decided to start my walking routine again, which I had quit during chemo.  Additionally I looked into dry brushing and added that to my morning routine. Then I researched the best exercise for lymphedema and invested in a good rebounder.  So my morning routine is this:  Dry brushing/shower/MLD/sleeve-glove/rebounding, then breakfast.  During the day I walk, do another rebounding session, as well as a rebounding session at night and then bandaging. I hope that I will be able to keep up this routine, as it seems to be helping already and I have only been doing it about 2 weeks.  My overall swelling seems down a few percentages and when I do swell, it seems not as much as before. My oncologist still doesn't get it.  He is a fantastic oncologist, but not so good at lymphedema.  He is constantly commenting on my hand/arm that, \"they look good, not much swelling at all\".  He doesn't get that I am killing myself to achieve this!  Holy cow!  But anyway.  I am thankful for the LE Clinic and what I learned there.  And I can't blame my doctor too much for not warning me of the side effect lymphedema, since it is not usual without surgery or radiation.  So my prayer is that I will be one of those people that after a year or so, it goes into remission and I won't have to wear this horrible glove forever.  I am doing everything I possibly can on my part to help along my chances. Please watch your arms and legs carefully if you have cancer involved lymph nodes and are on chemo. And relay to your doctor it can happen. As you probably know, the sooner you are diagnosed the better your chances. God's blessing upon you all, Victoria --- But thou, O Lord, art a shield for me: my glory, and the lifter of my head. - Psalm 3:3 --- Diagnosed: Lymphedema Left Arm.

I got my new bandage liner yesterday and tried it out last night.  WOW!!!  Love, love, love it.  It is so silky soft and so light.  The idea is you use it to replace some of the layers, but still use 1-2 bandages over it.  Well I tried that and it was too tight, so I took off the bandages and just used the liner and the optional outer sleeve and it was WONDERFUL.  It is a one piece with a built in gauntlet.  That worried me, so I tried it with my Imak Active Glove.  That bugged too, so I took off the glove and let my fingers be FREE.  The first time since the first week of November, NAKED and FREE!  Because the gauntlet is long the fingers are partially protected and I think I can get by.  I'm trying it again tonight.  Soft and dreamy!!!

You can't sleep in your sleeve. Sorry, but it's the only way to get that swelling down.  Also learn a good manual lymph drainage (MLD) massage.  Also watch your arm while you walk, don't let it swing down.  And be careful not to carry bags or packages with it.  As for washing, you can certainly wash them by hand, nothing will happen.  They take longer to dry than you would think, so you will need at least two pair to rotate.  The brand doesn't matter too much.  Ask your therapist about the correct compression rate.  It would be ideal if you could find a local fitter so you could try on some different ones and get a feel for your size and fit.  Good luck!",

RayRay, my LE-t says the dryer on low helps bring compression back.  So she recommends it for sleeves and bandages.  But I don't think it's that big a deal.  If they tend to shrink and you don't like that, then hang them up! I use lingere bags and dry on low, but shrinking is not a problem for me.  Most of the time I am hoping they will shrink.  I always hand wash and air dry my Farrow glove though, it's my p r e c i o u s.",

Carol. I'm not sure why they photographed the sleeve over a top, that is crazy.  I does come with two liners. I think they are not necessary, but more for keeping the garment clean.  As you said it will probably work better directly on the skin, especially if you are not putting bandages over it. One problem I am having with it is that it has a silky exterior and the sleeve cover is nylon and silky and tends to slide down during the night.  I think I will have to fashion some way to attach it to the sleeve. Yay Purple!  I hope you love them as much as I do.  I hope you ordered from Amazon.  I found them on Colonial and I had a coupon but their delivery time is about 3 weeks.  Oy.",

I am certainly not advocating wearing them all the time.  I am hoping that we all keep a close enough eye on our swelling, if any developed we would stop wearing them.  I get swelling some days from nothing at all, but I haven't seen anything from adding these.  But of course that is just me.  Everyone should evaluate their own situation.  My LE is mild to moderate, and I have been so diligent with my compliance, that frankly it's fun to have a little variety on occasion. And yes, my wrist is red in the picture, because I just took off my ugly glove for the picture. So, everything in moderation and with due diligence.  But sometimes, girls just wanna have fun.   ",

Or maybe it's the way the Juzo top is constructed, I have never had that roll, even in a non-max top.  I also have a Medi sleeve with a similar sillicone top, it's not a max, but it doesn't roll either.  I've been wearing some of my LympheDiva gauntlets with a beige sleeve or a colored Juzo Dream Sleeve, and it's a cute combo. So I still get some of the cute patterns.",

Purple, the end \"band\" on my Juzo is not so much a band, as a change in the knitting style.  It's not double or anything as it appears.  Dream sleeves are the ultimate in soft. I am so happy I found them.  Not to mention the beige being such a smooth flat knit that matches my skintone nicely.  With a contrasting guantlet my arm looks bare. Well bare-ish. ",

It took every fiber of strength in my body not to order the purple color!  But I choose the lightweight silk in black. KS1, yes I think you could wrap your fingers.  You would just have to be careful slipping it on.  I was planning on doing that myself, when to my surprise it doesn't seem to push fluid that way.  And I would say I'm slightly more towards the moderate end of the \"mild to moderate\" scale.  So i was very surprised.  Of course it might not be so for everyone.  Although there is no finger channeling, my fingers are covered to almost the third joint, so they are getting some compression.  I know awhile back I read someone here uses it over a glove for extra compression.  Mine is pretty snug for that, but it's a thought. Purple, it might be ok for you since you are so mild.  Really hard to say.  If it flows into your arm you need to get it up and out of there.  But I have been wearing it at night watching TV with a sleeve and it seems ok.  I wouldn't want to try sleeping in that combo. I saw a lot of success wearing it while walking, but it got sweaty and I decided not to do that anymore unless I get a second one for that purpose. ",
