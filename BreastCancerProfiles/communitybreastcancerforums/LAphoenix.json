Birki, Yeah, the whole Stage III thing is very confusing because different organizations have different definitions.  By some accounts, I would be IIIc because I had more than 10 affected lymph nodes.  Some cancer organizations don't even have a Stage IIIc, however, and don't subdivide by node number.  This is how breastcancer.org defines it: Stage IIIA describes invasive breast cancer in which: Stage IIIB This stage describes invasive breast cancer in which a tumor of any size has spread to the breast skin, chest wall, or internal mammary lymph nodes (located beneath the breast right under the ribs, inside the middle of the chest). By this definition I would be Stage IIIa, but my onc has me down as IIIb.  I've heard that some doctors like to use the higher subdivision as a way to get insurance companies to pay for treatment.   Amy G.",

If I hear anything else, I'll let you know. Best, Amy",

I finished active treatment in Feb 07 (Stage IIIb) and have had 2 PET scans and tumor marker tests every month since then. I meet with my onc. or his asst. every month. The second PET scan had a false posititve involving some lymph nodes, which I had to have a CT scan for. Of course, it was nerve-racking waiting for the results. I don't know how I feel about being monitored so closely. Part of me thinks it's a good idea to keep on top of things, while the other part hates the stress it causes. I've heard the argument your onc. probably makes--that it doesn't do any good to catch mets sooner rather than later, that the outcome is the same--but I don't know if I'm convinced by it. A friend made the point that, given how much research is being done and how many new drugs are being tried, it's possible that a treatment for mets that is more effective if used on small or fewer tumors, just might be developed. We're so programmed to think that early detection is better detection that it's hard to accept the more passive approach. I think you can divide oncologists into 2 basic camps--those who are aggressive and pro-active in their treatment, at all stages, and those who view bc as a chronic, long-term disease and have a more \"zen\" approach. I suspect most patients would be more comfortable with the former approach, but I honestly don't know which is more effective. It drives me crazy, though, that after all these decades of bc research and treatment, the oncology community (NIH, NCI, whatever) hasn't issued guidelines for all doctors to follow regarding post-treatment testing. But obviously there aren't any, because half the doctors do one thing, and the other half do the opposite. I guess you have to decide if the stress of testing would be more or less greater than the stress of waiting for symptoms to appear or not having the temporary peace of mind that negative testing can create. It's a tough choice.",
