After the tech was finished she brought in the radiologist to do his own evaluation. He found my implant and determined that the larger lump was in my implant and that the smaller lump was a subaceous cyst. He referred me to see my plastic surgeon to determine what the lump is and if it needs to be taken out. I met with my plastic surgeon on 2/22. I brought the ultrasound report and She did a very throrough exam of my right breast, I\u2019m a little sore in fact. I\u2019m glad that she did. She told me that there is no way that the lump is inside my implant. She showed me the exact implant I had and why it\u2019s not possible. She also found another lump. 3 total now. She did the same exam on my left breast. My left breast has no lumps and wasn\u2019t lumpy (fibrocystic) in general. After feeling both breasts at the same time she said she wants to do an MRI. It\u2019s scheduled for 3/5. I felt very brushed off by the radiologist. It seemed like as soon as he found my implant and the location of the lump he deemed it a problem with my implant. After the appointment I wasn\u2019t feeling confident in his diagnosis. My husband was jumping with joy and didn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t as happy as he was. I just continued to have the bad feeling. I haven\u2019t slept for more than an hour or two a night since I found the first lump. I understand how unlikely it is that I have BC, but I also don\u2019t want to look back a few years from now and find out I do and wish I had pushed more.",

Last week while doing a self exam I found a lump in my right breast about the size of a milk dud that is solid and hard. It's not moveable and it doesn't hurt. Unless you count me pushing on it to keep checking if it's still there. I made an appointment with my Gyno right away. During the appt on Monday she felt the lump I found at 9 O'clock and also found a pea sized lump at 10 O'clock. I have an US in the morning and I am freaking out a bit.. okay, a lot. My nipples are incredibly sore, before I found the lump I thought I might be pregnant (I peed on a stick, negative). I have had an IUD for 2 years. I am 27 (28 in a few months) I am married with a 2yo. I have no family history of BC. I have had saline breast implants since 2009 and the AA cup I was sporting leaves me now with little breast tissue. My doctor told me the implants actually helped to feel because the implant is pushing all the tissue to the top. My doc told me that because of my age it's very, very unlikely that it's BC and most likely a Fibroadenoma. Reading everything that I have in the last couple of days I feel like I kind of have to throw the age factor out the window. I know that only the US will be able to tell either way. I'm a bit of a mess. Thank you to anyone who reads this, Please share your thoughts with me. Log in to post a reply",
