He said it could be that the lump moved when they pressed down with the ultra sound wand or it could be that the lump has the same density of surrounding tissue.. He wants me to follow up with a general surgeon and see if she can basically force them to do a mammogram or she may feel that it is nothing and have me watch it and come back after a few months.. It's super intimidating to me thinking about going to a general surgeon but I want answers! And to answer your question, yes it seems to change all the time with my menstrual cycle.. During my period it seems much larger..it has also gotten more tender",

I went to my regular doctor and upon a breast exam he felt like I should have further testing. He referred me to a radiologist and I just had my appointment today.. I was scheduled for a mommogram and an ultra sound.. I had the ultra sound and the radiologist said that she didn't see anything and she was not going to do the mammogram because of my age.. I do not like the fact that she was ruling out doing a procedure due to my age.. I feel like I wasn't taken seriously and they said they did not see anything on my ultrasound.. How is this possible when me and my doctor felt this lump. I don't know if I should not worry and just trust the radiologist or if I should press the issue and get a second opinion. I have really large breasts so I'm worried that she just missed it!Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated! Thank you! Log in to post a reply",

I'm just frustrated because I thought this appointment was going to give me peace of mind but instead it made me worried that I have something lurking in my breast that can't be detected.. I would have settled for it just being fatty tissue or something but for them to say they didn't see anything at all just leaves me with more questions.. The radiologist just said that if I notice any nipple discharge on go to my regular doctor.. I'm really worried.",

I go to my family doctor for annual PAP smears and breast exams.. He use to deliver babies.. However he is my family physician and not specifically an OBGYN.. Would they have further insight into this issue",
