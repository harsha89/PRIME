My situation: Lobular invasive 2.5 cm Bilateral mastectomy Sentinel node showed 2 + nodes There is lymphatic invasion. There are 2 options I am given : 1 - Have axillary lymph removal, if more come out positive rads to whole chest incl. axill. 2 - Have axillary lymph removal if none come out positive no rads. I am getting conflicting view, some docs say not to remove more lymph nodes for staging purposes and go with the rads. Others are saying that the side effects of axillary rads is bad I would rather have the lymphs remove if I can get away with only breast rad ( no rad to axillary) Anyone go through anything similar or can point me to some research on this ? Thanks !",

Maybe cause I was tensing up a lot during the treatment ? The nurse was not able to answer my questions which were: - Why should we avoid hot and cold showers (I do hydrotherapy cold-hot showers everyday) - Why cant' we swim ? One would think that being a nurse she would know the answers ! she kept on repeating: \" you just have to avoid hot and cold and not swim for 7 weeks\" And I was repeating \" i understand you but why ??? does it interfere with how radiation works ? Is it something with the veins constricting/contracting ?? \" Finally she  brought one of the radiation therapists to answer my questions, basically she said that they wanted to baby the skin during rads. Ok now we are talking I said. So I will not do my hydrotherapy , but I will just protect the skin getting rads  by applying vaseline before going swimming. She thought it was a good plan or she wanted to get rid of me. In any case I will be swimming maybe not often but once a week, hopefullly the vaseline will seal out the drying effect of the chlorine, I was not able to swim after mastectomy then  during chemo cause I was afraid of catching infections from the gym pool, then  had my exchange surgery and finally thought I could hit the pool again. I am also taking curcumin ( see the curcumin thread in alternative treatments) it seems to protect the skin and is stated to possibly enhance the efficacy of radiation and taxol ( but counteracts with AC)",

So looking at the end of 1st week might not be enough.  I have completed 10th treatment today and I do not see anything unusual on the breast. I have been putting pure aloe gel on it immediately after each tx, and have been putting aquaphor at nights, no bras, cotton tops and leaving it open at night.

Swimming max once a week limiting it to 30 minutes putting aquaphor before swimming and immediately rinsing off when getting out of the pool and put aquaphor again.  I had to take a quick nap I crash definitely after the rads for a couple of hours. ",

Others are saying that the side effects of axillary rads is bad I would rather have the lymphs remove if I can get away with only breast rad ( no rad to axillary) If there is cancer activity in the remaining lymphs does the rad fry the cancer ? Do the lymph nodes themselves ever recover from the rads ? I am a very active person ( triathlons and rowing ) and am fighting to keep my little lymphs with me  hate to sacrifice them for 'staging' purposes.

ONCOTYPE DX This genetic screen analyzes 21 genes critical to breast-cell growth and uses live rather than frozen tissue. The result consists of a recurrence score, from zero to 100, that indicates a woman's risk of seeing her cancer return within 10 years of her diagnosis. High scores have been correlated with better responses to chemotherapy, and since its approval in 2004, the test has changed treatment decisions in about 30% of cases. WHO BENEFITS Women with estrogen-receptor-positive cancers at the earliest stage of the disease MAMMAPRINT Similar to Oncotype DX, this test scans 70 genes expressed in breast tissue. A high score means a woman has a 25% chance of seeing her cancer spread to other tissues in five years, while a low risk score indicates a 90% chance that her cancer will not spread. One disadvantage of the screen: it requires frozen-tissue samples, which most U.S. hospitals do not routinely collect following cancer surgeries. AVAILABILITY Approved by the U.S. FDA earlier this year, after being on the market in Europe since 2005 AMPLICHIP Unlike the other gene screens, this test extracts DNA from a blood sample to detect an enzyme that controls the way a cancer drug, tamoxifen, is broken down. Certain genetic mutations can virtually shut down a cell's ability to metabolize tamoxifen, dramatically reducing the estrogen-based drug's success in containing tumor-cell growth. Screening women for this enzyme is sparing low responders the expense and time that would be lost trying an ineffective treatment. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1668462,00.html",

However your nodes are clear so your situation is a lot different. If you had mastectomy .. and no node involvement I am not sure that I ran into any studies showing the benefit to your situation but I do know a lot of people who did rads with lumpectomy and no node involvement.

Another idea is to  eat yogurt proactively to prevent diarrhea after your next tx. One little serving a day should do it ( assuming that the onc is ok with it ) go with the plain one. I have been diluting my water with cranberry juice( proactively trying to ward off any UTI) and also soak 2-3 prunes in hot water at  night and drink the water and eat the prunes first thing in the morning - ward off constipation.  Oh well at least that would be my action plan, but again I am infamous for making the docs/nurses angry with my incessant questions about not taking any meds, and treating symptoms with complimentary stuff. Nancy my chemo twin !!! so sorry to hear that, I too got quite ill the same night. Aloxi just does not do zilch !! I found out that my stomach was churning acid like crazy ( you would know if you are too when you throw up), so I started zantac and that helped the nausea A LOT ! - you might want to ask your onc about that if you also felt a lot of acid while you were throwing up.

They are also being studied for: reducing the risk of bone pain caused by cancer that has spread to the bone; and treating hypercalcemia (when calcium levels in the blood are too high). Examples are Fosamax (chemical name: alendronate sodium) and Actonel (chemical name: risedronate).   Is the following the trial you have been offered ?

There was a cream that people were suggesting for rads to prevent/help any irritation to the area forgot its name did you get that ?(rad board gals would know) Yesterday I overdid it. Somehow when I returned to work at the office I suddenly thought that I could do everything that I used to do.. so I gave the spinning class at 5:45 in the morning, stopped by another gym to talk to a personal trainer, went to work, went to the tire store ( got 2 nails in 2 different tires)had lunch with a friend while waiting for the new tires, went back to work, drove 20 miles to pick up a friend to go to a Kundalini Yoga session which was a further 15 miles away. Did 1.5 hour K yoga, then went to the friends house to dinner.. then came home.. but I was literally falling asleep at the red lights .. for the first time in months I was able to get some sleep without even any sleep aids. Today I still am feeling the fatigue.. that was stupid of me.   Going back to work really helped my mood, the people who did not know what I went through just thought I was working from home. They complimented on my new hair color ( a redhead !) I guess Iwas pretty good in camouflaging that I did not have any eyelashes and only a couple of strands of eyebrows. I put the others who were 'avoiding eye contact with me' at east by starting out a conversation from where we left never mentioning anything about my treatments unless they asked.. that seemed to work pretty well. Wish we could do something like 'September chemo gals unite'  that would be so cool. Healing vibes your way Cheryll I hope the shoulder gets better quickly. MJ this is how I usually get my fruits/veggies, fruits are easier veggies are a bit harder: smoothies munching on baby carrots and celery stalks making sure to have a salad or steamed vegetable at every meal. putting in spinach/peppers .. anything I can get my hands on in egg white omelettes. And if you feel like eating lots of something(which happens to me a lot) I go for air popped popcorn. Then I spray it with Pam and sprinkle it with salt(Pam helps the salt stay on). It is a pretty low calory high fiber snack. Thats pretty much it.",

The only thing I am puzzled is that FISH is supposed to be more accurate than IHC. I think I will ask for the following from my oncologist : \"Equivocal FISH samples are confirmed by counting additional cells or repeating the FISH test. If FISH remains equivocal after additional cells counted or assay repeated, confirmatory IHC is recommended so that HER2 protein expression is known for the sample with true equivocal gene amplification status \" Trigeek - blabbering",

My old self which was sexy and beautiful.. but ruthless-with no heart is ripping the 'new me' apart, choking the 'present me' trying to break my newly developing spine, core. My old self is 'extinct' 'dead'even 'fake'  but it is not aware of it, and is not letting 'present me' thrive,come alive,emerge, be born.. constantly wounding the 'new me'. 'The new' me is getting stronger thriving despite all these. it has immense healing powers and has unwavering strength. It is also understanding towards the 'old me' tolerating the abuse coming from it, as this abuse is making the 'new me' even stronger. There is even a little understanding/empathy coming from the new to the old. The old me is turning away from the light, as the new me is facing towards the light\"",

Doc: I ordered tumor markers from todays sample. Me: Oh .. was that done before ? Doc: Yes I circled that by mistake on your last chemo day and it came out a bit high 70. But do not take that into consideration chemo sometimes does cause a raise in the tumor markers, the trend is important so we'll look at what yours is today and then talk about it, you should get a call from us next week. And my whole world shattered at that point. I almost felt like the first day of my diagnosis,got teary eyed, yes I have heard of recurrence but I am frikkin not even done with my  treatment yet !!!!. The DH who was with me wanted to take me out to lunch but I just needed to be alone, came home alone and bawled my eyes out. My tumor marker was 37 ( anything below 40 is ok) when I first got diagnosed in August. How can this happen ? How can it raise to 70 ??? I read that sometimes the tumor markers are high because cancer cells die from chemo and the test picks that up. But that means that there were other c's in my body. The night sweats are not letting me sleep, I think I need to go on an antidepressant now.. ",

Today the 2nd treatment went so easier, during treatment I pictured my normal cells donning shields like the ones in the movie 300, and pushing the cells that 'have the thought of being immortal - c cells' outwards exposing them to the radiation beams unprotected.  And today finally I was able to focus at work.  But I did start feeling a bit fatigued 1 hour after tx, and then slowly recovered about 5 hours after, I think it might be psychological since I am only at the start.",

Tumors ( unles inflammatory do not grow in bounds and leaps as I was told ) but I totally understand how you are feeling. I was so frustrated that I could not get a surgery appointment for a couple of weeks I was joking around saying ' I will just chop off both boobs and call 911 to patch me up'  Tumors take several years to grow so a couple of weeks is not significant and is worth making a good solid action plan finding an oncologist that you trust during that time. Now I am no expert at all.. but I know that if they think that the tumor is large ( like 5  cm's I think- not sure ) then they shrink it before surgery to see how it responds to chemo which I think is good. There is a gal 'shrink' who posts who went on chemo before surgery and the 6 cm tumor actually disappeared..  it could be a real good feeling of accomplishment for you and your oncologist to see that the response to chemo was really good. I think neoadjuvant chemo is picking up more and more oncologists seem to like going that route. My tumor showed up as 2.1 cm on mammogram, and 1.8 in MRI and ended up being 2.5 cm's ( at surgery) so you actually do not know for sure. \"Is there a waiting period after port placement before I can start chemo?\" My 1st oncologist was going to start chemo the day after port placement cause I raised a stink to start early.. feeling the way that you do now. Then I switched oncologists and the second one said that he preferred to wait for about 1 week to let the surgery site settle a bit. I was happy that I waited that 1 week let me tell you. Also another thing, if you do the chemo first and it wipes the cancer  off your lymphnodes.. then they do a sentinel node biopsy and nothing shows up you might get to keep your lymph nodes without a need for axillary dissection  thus avoid lymphedema danger(I have not heard this from any doc but it makes sense to me - might want to run this scenario by him) And ask whether they will be doing a PET scan to get a baseline of the 'hot spots' on your body before doing the chemo so it can be compared to later PET scans, I did not do this and regret it. Sorry that you had to be-friend us but you will find a lot of people who has been in your footsteps and you will not feel alone. Good luck !!",

Thus had crying spells at nights - whats up with the darkness ?? it depressed the hell out of me. Luckily things seems to have settled down a bit. Weight gain has gotten out of control, I find myself driving to a 7/11 at 11 pm to grab a Milky Way. Nothing with high calories is safe from me at home. I started my workouts and since they gave an extra week off for T-giving I was able to do a 40 mile slow bike ride on saturday and a 6 mile sluggish jog on sunday- had to take 3-4 hour naps after each of course-. My heart rate has been worrisome at least 15 bpm higher than it used to be(saw 183 on my heart rate monitor), will ask to be referred to a cardiologist. Also started working with weights with my personal trainer but have problems with the chest muscles ( thought they should have healed by now it has almost been 3 months since the masc) so I can not work out like I want to we are mainly focusing on lower body. This Thursday is my first of the 4 Taxols. So pax you are saying that I might not get the neulesta this time ? When I was going up hill on the bike and when I am doing leg presses I am getting a weird sensation like a warmth up my spine starting from my tailbone which travels up andblows up at the bottom of my scull neck.. anyone else have that weird feeling ?  It is not exactly a pain and goes away immediately, it almost is like a spine rush.. if there is such a thing. I am getting used to people staring at me when I am not looking their way and then avoiding my eyes when I look back at them when I have my chemo look (bandanna or scarf) that used to bother me a lot.  Do they have a right to make me feel bad just because their follicles are attached to their roots ??? See gals thats why I have not been posting, as my daughters say I definitely turned into a chemo bitch  .",

I am trying to get the Port Removal, Axillary Node Dissection and the Implant exchange done at the same time, the surgeon did not like the idea but my oncologist asked me to push for it to minimize procedures.  He has very strong feelings that none of the other nodes will test + thus I would not need rads, I believe him ! Last Taxol is tomorrow and I baked Weight Watchers Better than Sex cake to the chemo nurses.. I want to say 'YEY' but I am dreading the GI problems I had the last 2 treatments. My oncologist hugged me and said that he'd see me in 6 weeks, now why do I feel like a kid who is watching his parents drive away after having been dropped off to Summer Camp for the first time ?

Yesterday splurged and bought the Nioxin series the whole thing, boy that is a lot of hair products for a white peach fuzz but I like the idea of using different stuff on my hair finally after using body wash for 4 months. Oopps I think I need to clarify. I meant that my oncologist said that 'he'll still be my friend.. and treat me' even if I did not get the AND surgery. I really liked him up to this point. However I might  have doubts about him and his action plans from now since I did not listen to this one. ( that means that we are not on the same page).. time will show can not handle another change now. So my rads will not start until around March ( have to give 3 weeks recovery time after the expander exchange) I will ping you gals for any tips. Today I am going to a bc support group meeting at the hospital to check it out. I do not want to go on antidepressants but I can not focus at work so will try therapy.  It has been almost 3 weeks after my last tx but I feel really tired, coming down with a cold/cough.. my heart rate is high is this a Neulesta withdrawal ??

I have been major stressed again gals, just as I thought that I would get a breather after making the decision on not to get node dissection. Moffitt cancer center ( to which I had gone for an opinion ) sent a fax. In my original pathlogy report my her2 was -, with IHC testing .9 so I thought it was cool a fish was never requested since it was not borderline For a reason unknown to me the moffit center did a FISH test and faxed the result to me \" ER2/neu by FISH: EQUIVOCAL Ratio of HER2/neu signals to chromosome 17: 1.7 The average of Her-2/neu copies per cell: 1.1 The cutoff point for reassessing Her-2/neu gene amplification is a her-2/cen17 ratio of 2.0 The specimen is considered EQUIVOCAL for the Her-2/neu gene. This result falls within the range of 'equivocal\" ( 1.8-2.2) as defined by the 2007 ASCO/CAP guidelines. Comparion with results from another methodology such as immunohistochemistry may be of benefit. I do not know what the @#$%! equivocal means in this context  and my IHC (immunohistochemistry) was .9 !!!!! 'google'ing: The original FISH test results were defined as either positive or negative, but an intermediate range (from hereon referred to as equivocal range) has since been described and the clinical significance of this observation remains unclear.34-3 This strategy classifies patients as having HER2-positive disease based on positive results with either test. It is recognized that current data are insufficient to define whether these patients represent true- or false-positives It is also clear from the panel discussion and literature review that patients with equivocal HER2 test results constitute a poorly studied subgroup with uncertain association of test scores to benefit from HER2-directed therapy.60 The panel suggested that further studies of this patient group would be promoted by defining these test results as equivocal or borderline. The panel elected to use the term equivocal to avoid confusion with borderline positive and borderline negative terminology which is sometimes used in the interpretation of FISH assays. Equivocal results of a single test require additional action which should be specified in the initial report. Equivocal IHC samples must be confirmed by FISH analysis of the sample. Equivocal FISH samples are confirmed by counting additional cells or repeating the FISH test. If FISH remains equivocal after additional cells counted or assay repeated, confirmatory IHC is recommended so that HER2 protein expression is known for the sample with true equivocal gene amplification status. \" \" An important gap in the literature identified by the panel concerns those patients with test results in the intermediate or equivocal range. The decision to treat with specific therapies like trastuzumab is by necessity dichotomous (yes or no). However, HER2 test results are derived from a continuous variable, which can be expected to lead to some results falling into a gray area. Adding to this confusion is the fact that there is significant variation in the intermediate ranges for both the IHC and FISH assays. \" \"The results of these surveys have shown that there is variation in laboratory performance, particularly for immunohistochemical assays with equivocal positive results or FISH testing with borderline results. The variation in immunohistochemical testing is greater than the variation in FISH testing. These results need to be interpreted with caution; however, as far fewer labs perform FISH than perform IHC, and FISH testing tends to be done in higher volume laboratories. The voluntary enrollment in this educational program leads to only a minority of laboratories doing this testing. Although the exact number of laboratories involved in HER2 testing is unknown, it is thought that about 2,000 laboratories perform HER2 IHC and about 500 laboratories perform HER2 FISH testing in the United States. \" If someone else says that I am in the gray area in anything I will surely rip their heads off !! Now how am I supposed to wait until I see my oncologist to see what this means for my treatment ???? Arghh !~!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Tamox is supposed to make them worse !! geesh I will be in deep s..t, as I did not even start that yet. 8 out of 33 rads done, not feeling any se's yet. Trying to check the bc.org only twice a week, trying to adapt to normal life and minimize bc as much as I can.",

Every morning I am tempted to 'call in sick' and go to the beach or just sit in front of tv and veg instead of doing a job which I really do not like, but pays the bills and has good medical coverage. I was told that it really does get better, I have completed 9 out of 33 rads and will be going on tamoxifen. I find that I am learning to live with my fear, denying its existence was too tiring. Denial to an extent seems to be necessary for daily survival, but I am not kidding myself and am factoring that I harbored bc at one point in my life in all my decisions. We just have to learn to live with this uncertainty I presume, after all no one having bc or not, does not have a guaranteed expiration date right ? Hang in there, and it is great to hear from you ! Sometimes it is really bad and I think about going on antidepressants ( would probably help my night flashes which are horrible ! ), and I might anyday do so.",

I have started ramping up my walkings to prepare for the breast cancer half marathon in February, today walked 3.3 miles and went to a Kundalini Yoga session. Tomorrow I will go on a bike ride hopefully will be able to slug the 20 miles without having to call a ride, I will be watching the swim to bike transition of the Great Floridian Ironman which was my first IM event, very special day. My heart rate has been extremely high ( guess the red devil might be  to blame) so am holding myself back with a heart rate monitor. My theory is that if you do a brisk walk or cardio 40 - 60 minutes  everyday you speed up your metabolism to you can get rid of the chemo toxins quicker.. that and hydration.. dunno whether it is scientific or is it me bs'ing myself lol.  Until my 3rd tx next Thursday I will be able to lead a life similar to normal. And one of my friends will be  flying in to see me tomorrow yey !!! Did any of you gals have a single episode of diarrhea like 5-6 days after the chemo ?

Pax your posts are giving me fresh air I feel all cooped up in the city here but love the outdoors. ( except the 'doe' part .. I am not a vegetarian but still felt bad about it ) Cheryl : Tearing, I read somewhere that since we lose some of the eyelashes and have less protection we get more stuff/dust  in the eye, thus the tearing. Urbie My eyes get bloodshot too couple of days after each tx I put some otc Systane eye drops which seems to calm/relieve it ( did not run it by the onco though) My problem is a skipped period and then the second one came and is going on fooorrreeevvveeerrr ( almost 2 weeks now) it is very light but bothersome. So much for intimacy issues hehe.. how can one feel 'hot' when you are bald, with weird boobs(expanders hard as a road bike tire),bleeding and constantly nauseaus ohh and add the fact that since I seem to be craving all the 'wrong' stuff a steady weight gain..Yesterday had a craving for ham and cheese sandwich, ate a whole baguette with cheese spread and ham. arghhh.. But I finally found out why I always am craving the 'fatty' stuff. If my stomach is empty I get nausea but if I eat hard to digest stuff like fries and cheese it takes a while for it to empty. Hoping that Taxol is easier on my body,. Oh and for anyone having constipation issues I found a really good remedy. Soak 3 prunes in boiling water at night ( in a large coffee mug or bowl) in the morning drink it and eat the prunes first thing. It seems to have worked like a charm for constip. I take them proactively 1 day before each tx and continue for a couple of days. Ohh questions my oncologist is making me take 5 decandrons 4 hours before the taxol.. is that what you gals did too ?",

Granny MJ --CONGRATS ON CHEMO GRADUATION !! and  I am soo glad that the echo and EF is normal yey !! go shoot that stupid tech( I actually would have written something to the office manager regarding her comments) . I was on Paxil for 2 months after my dx(later learned that Paxil causes bc ????) and went off of it cause it made me feel 'too mellow' and mellow ain't me !!! But it was ok for the times when I was just bouncing off the walls panicking. .  Happy B-day MARIETTA !!!! .  Trigeek is on another tail spin gals.. .  Went to another surgeon today (got his name from one of the bc gals on this forum ginger) Here is his take: What he said was basically the same line with the radiation oncologists. He does not see removing of the Level 1 & 2 nodes as a treatment, but more of a staging tool. He also said that at a conference that he attended there was a heated discussion on this specific subject and no consencus was reached. . His points were: 1 - My lymph node involvement seems to be minor, 10-15 years ago my case might have tested as Node negative, the IHC(Immunohistologic staining) is too accurate and captures even minute amounts now. ( 6 nodes were removed from me 2 tested + one <.2mm the other >2mm) 2 - The c cells are trapped into the lymph nodes ( who were doing their jobs of capturing bad stuff from going into the system) and they do not go anywhere from where they are captured. (did not know this) 3 - All Lymph nodes are not removed anyways only Levels 1&2 are removed, what happens to the rest ? ( levels 3&4 ) 4 - The area will be monitored closely for any enlargement of the lymphs and then the AND will be performed if such a thing occurs. 5 - The chemo and rads should take care of any micromets that are in that area. 6 - He has only done 1 AND in the last 5 years and that was done at  the request of the patient. .  I was not confused when I left the doctors office because I really do understand what is going on now. This issue of AND being part of the treatment or not is at a turning point in the medical community. And those who do not want to stick their necks out are erring on the side of convention/caution. If one looks at the evolution of the mastectomy which was a totally debilitating surgery when it first was done- removing chest muscles and everything .. to how it is done today, just removing the breast tissue by ensuring of clear margins. So I do have a surgery date of February 14th and will hold on to it for now but I am moving away from it slowly. . When I got home I decided to give a call to Moffitt c center who still has not returned my slides to ormc. The breast center coordinator stated that they were looking at the unstained slides and were doing the her2/neu .. WT >???????? They had the slides for 6 weeks now. I asked whether they were doing FISH she said yes. Hmm.. this is a bit worrisome my initial pathology said HER-, and if they are suspecting HER+ this will change the treatment going forward. But then why the the surgeon at the Moffitt center say that they agreed with the pathology ? Could it be that they had not reviewed it actually at that time ? My original pathology says HER2 = .9 This really sucks !!! Another thing to worry about. . After that my breast surgeon called ( I had called her) she said that if it was her, she would not get the AND.. since I was getting rads. She also added that If there is still c sh..t in the lymph nodes after chemo and rads I should really be worrying about the systematic mets since that means that chemo and rads did not work,  local recurrence is not worrisome no one got into trouble cause of lymph mets. .  My million $ question was that  whether the c could possibly spread from the lymphs where they were living (if there is still stuff in the remaining ones) I really do not know gals..  I seriously am not comfortable giving away my lymph nodes whereas all the new findings are showing that for this scenario I should not need to do so. . I am looking for some signs to help me make a decision, I even did some blind drawing with crayons(put a pile of crayons in front of me and made pictures of surgery versus radiation choosing colors and drawing blindfolded hoping that I would choose some gloomy color in one scenario ) but this did not show me anything either. . So far those who say go for node dissection: 1 - My oncologist -- has a HUGE weight 1 - Major cancer center surgeon(who is kind of a rookie) Those who say no go for node dissection, but just do rads: 2 - radiation oncologists 3 - surgeons 1 - major cancer center tumor board.(that includes my surgeon) .  So no rads are winning 6 to 2.  . If I do not do dissection my oncologist said that he was ok with it, however then that means that I can not trust him 100% in my treatment going forward..and I need to find a new oncologist ( he already is my 2nd one !) . I know you all are going to say 'good grief girl, just let it go' BUT I CANNOT !!! I am being tested I know, but for what I do not have a clue !",

The support group was interesting there were 2 counselors(one cold as ice I would not hold the door to her !! ) and they explained the benefits of journaling, there were only 2 other gals there and their expectation was more of a group therapy rather than a workshop setup.

I started mine and you can see it at: http://www.fitday.com/WebFit/PublicJournals.html?Owner=triagain2002 I used to be able to lose weight so quickly ( like 14 pounds in 2 weeks without crash dieting) but now it is stuck !! .

Status on my surgery : Cancelled the Axillary Node dissection just going with the Breast Implant exchange than a daily tanning appointment with my rads guy. My oncologist will not be happy I know but I believe this was the right way for me to go. I am excited about my decision I do not know why. My lymph nodes are having a little 'right to live' party and I am trying to talk to them about behaving from now on and killing any stray c cells that they might happen to stumble onto and let anything having the name start with c zapped at the rad table.

Since I did not report having any morning sickness while pregnant  or motion sickness  I think they went easy on my meds, only giving me Aloxi and steroid during the tx and nothing afterwards. Luckily I had the prescription for Compazine from my previous onc. and started taking one proactively every 8 hours that took the edge off. Also took otc zantac which seems to control the acid that my stomach seems to be adamant in churning up in big amounts. They have prescribed Emend for the next round.  Running into another problem though - lack of sleep - will probably put a post out there. What happened to the wiped out feeling ? I am jumping out of my skin since I got the tx and it has been almost 6 days now, I can not sleep/nap it is horrible cause I do feel tired and I do know that I need the sleep to recover. I have some xanax ( which seems to work a bit ), ambien does zilch ! Ativan seemed to work but my onc nurse said not to take it ???? I just want to get a good nights sleep .. ok let me post this  out there for all the chemo gals to see. Aylin",

The color definitely matched your skin tone and the cut complimented your face shape.  Can you post a pre-chemo picture ?

How is the hair coming along did you go commando yet ? Received a call from my oncologist today, following is a summary of what he said:  He started out saying that he is very confident of their HER2 expertise saying that they were one of the pioneers who worked with UCLA. -- > established credibility. The tumors are not heterogeneous so different parts might show different results ( IHC showing HER-, whereas FISH showing Equivocal). The result is not very surprising and it happens a lot. From these 2 test results apparently my HER+ is not established and is not highly positive. Herceptins benefit is directly proportional to the degree of HER positivity so it will not be very beneficial for me since none of the tests revealed high counts. Even if I was proven HER+ at this point my treatment plan would not change because the benefit I will gain from Herceptin will be greatly be offset and exceeded by the potential cardiac toxicity that a treatment containing Adriamycin topped by Herceptin could cause. The chemo regimen I received Dose Dense 4 X AC and 4 X Taxol is a perfect chemo for a possible HER+ situation. ( here I have to thank him because I had wanted to drop the Taxol, since the research establishing the fact that HER- patients had not benefited from taxol was published at the beginning of my treatment, and he had not let me drop it ) He also supported his view of removing my port during surgery ( the other oncologists usually want to leave it in for 2 years in case there is a recurrence) - To leave the port in is a negative thought. - The likelyhood of getting an infection or other complication related the port is higher than the risk of recurrence. - I will be getting surgery anyways (getting the expanders replaced by silicone implants) The radiation delay ( I will be starting radiation about 8 weeks after my last chemo) did not worry him for my situation either. So he pretty much put my mind at ease which is what I desperately needed now.  I am happy that I was able to believe him. Sorry for all the vents, I really need to learn one lesson from all these, I can not control everything in life and sometimes will needto go with the flow.",

I think I am bouncing back, adapting... have to put on lots of makeup tho to cover the puffy eyes.  . Now why do I feel like I am the mouse in a cat&mouse game ?

      "Content": "Jan 12, 2008 09:23AM - edited Jan 12, 2008 09:30AM by trigeek Ok let me put a different spin on things... Take someone who is single mindedly thinking about something (lets say racing cars..) for at least 6 months(more like years) to the point of clinical obsession, all they can think about are cars. When they eat they think about cars, when they sleep the last thing that comes to their mind are cars/racing,.. when they are in the movies all they see are the cars and their performance... Everything else becomes pretty unimportant for them.. as far as they are concerned as long as they can race a car really fast nothing else matters.. (symbollizing beating the bc sh..t) - ask yourself how many times do you visit this site during the day ? ( I think personally I visit it at least every other hour if not more when I am in front of the pc) . Now in their daily thoughts that person will not be 100% committed to whatever they are doing(unless it is cars) even if they  think they are focusing on something else(conversation, cooking, working .. ) there is this subconscious voice that is actually hogging everything creating almost a static noise in the background..thus things get messed up cause we are actually not applying ourselves . . Think about the characterized crazy professors  who do really stupid things, is there something wrong with their brains ? Probably not, but are they just obsessed about their subjects .. you bet they are. Does everything else kind of lose importance and becomes silly details that they really do not think is important..yup !  . Also admit that after we got diagnosed with BC the expectations of the society might be lowered from most of us.. cutting us a bit of a slack and making us relax for a while.. thus the loss of efficient acting/planning like loss of the skills that we had developed in decades.. we were more like a record played at 33 rpm instead of 45 as it was intended. . And c'mon I remember doing sillier things during specific times  my life was really hectic before chemo don't you ?.. like forgetting where I was heading to while driving on the highway for a minute.. or putting the car keys in the freezer.. ohhh and at one point I was obsesses about dieting/food, I submitted a document print from my pc, headed to the office kitchen ( which has the printer too ) and was looking for the printout in the fridge.. that one was priceless !!!!,trying to get the car key into the ignition.. wondering why it will not go in until I realize that there actually is another key in and I am trying to force the spare one in on top of it !!! . Of course now 'Chemo Brain' is a great excuse that I personally  use to send the hubby to the grocery store 3 times a day ( shhhh I hope he is not snooping around this board), but in reality I am just not focused on what I need now and do not care that much, not that I forget I simply am not as efficient organized as I was in last July. . There probably is such a physiological change as  Chemo Brain but I think that by showing a conscious effort to get back to where we are we might be able to  claim back at least part of what we might have lost.  . Sorry if I offended anyone.. this is my personal take on Chemo brain.. and yes I do have it .. but I think I can work it away.( majority if not all of it ) .

      "Content": "Oct 8, 2007 05:41PM - edited Oct 8, 2007 05:41PM by trigeek Hi Jackie, Sorry to hear about your diagnosis..  but welcome aboard. This is such a personal decision, I can only share the path that I took and my reasons for it please take it with a grain of salt as everyones path in life and their thought process is very different.  I am 44 did not have any of the risk factors or family history for BC. ( no siblings, no female relatives diagnosed with BC only a grandmother that passedaway in her 40's for unknown-suspicious reasons), not overweigth, no alcohol use, extremely active.  I had mammograms and ultrasounds every year on the clock ( cause I had dense breast tissues ) did manual exams sometimes and got my ob-gyn check my breasts yearly. All was clear although I had extremely dense breast tissues ( RED FLAG !!) This year during my regular mammogram a mass was found and was an Invasive Lobular Carcinoma which was thought to be 2 cm and possibly no lymph node involvement. The surgeon thought it was stage1 or maybe an early stage 2 prior to surgery. The beast had been brewing for several years I have been told, not detected by mammos/ultrasounds. Due to the following reasons I chose a bilateral mastectomy  with immediate reconstruction with expanders.( I was given an option of lumpectomy) 1 - Grandmother passing away from unknown causes. 2 - Type of cancer - lobular is sneaky and tends to appear in the other breast later. 3 - Type of cancer - lobular is not usually detected with screening tools like mammograms until it is larger. 4 - Small breasts- lumpectomy would take most of it, single mastectomy would bring the issue of matching the other breast.. and when growing older having 1 boob sag while the other is all perky 5 - Piece of mind.. I just could not think about going through mammo again with the other breast. Now if it was ductal the decision might have been a little harder if I was planning to have children and nurse I might have opted to keep one or go for a lumpectomy. I know several people who are  10 years out of a lumpectomy from bc who have clean bills of health. After the surgery I was told that the other breast was clear but the one having the mass had several other nodules which did not show up in mri or the mammo(thats the sneaky nature of lobular), there were actually 2 lymph nodes involved making me a stage 2b.... so I was very relieved about my decision.  Recovering from a double mastectomy is naturally a lot harder than a single or a lumpectomy but after about 2  weeks you are pretty much functioning on a daily basis (although on a limited basis until week 6 depending on the type of reconstruction if you choose to get it)  Good luck with your decision, do your homework, find a surgeon that you are comfortable with follow your heart you will know which choice is right for you. And no matter what your choice will be make peace with it and never go back and question it ! My thoughts will be with you.. Aylin",

The other breast was collateral damage as there was nothing in it.. however in the one that showed up the bc.. there were other stuff brewing which was not apparent in mammo or mri so I am glad I chose this route. Guess I am not brave.. I acted on the suggestion to hit the bc the hardest way initially.. as that is extremely important. Opted for dose dense chemo.. and also begged for radiation afterwards...

After BC dx.. a rising sun makes me appreciate the beauty of it and make me thankful that I can enjoy it. Before BC dx.. walking my lab was a chore After BC dx.. can't wait until I can walk my puppy again ( have to learn to use the left arm due to lymphedema scare on right) Before BC dx... driving my car blasting my favorite tunes was fun After BC dx.. doing this after being grounded for 2 weeks after mastectomy was PRICELESS ! ( Better than.. you know what lol) I am a strong believer of mind over body ( don't ask me what made our minds ask for bc.. have been asking that question too many times). And I believe that I only will not have the same/even more energy, cause I will be really taking care of my body a lot more, focusing on resting which I hardly did before, I will also be able to have a lot more 'drive' to do the things I want to do, and will have more energy since I will have the mindset. And definitely will be able to enjoy everything a lot more than some people who go through their days miserable for no apparent reason. So bluewillow from now on camping might have a new meaning for you and waking up to the fresh mornings probably will give you a pleasure that you have not experienced till now.  Ahh.. too much philosophy but the sunrise was simply awesome this morning !
