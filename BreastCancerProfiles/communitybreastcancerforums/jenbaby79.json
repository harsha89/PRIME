About a month ago I noticed that my right breast had been itching like crazy, I went to the bathroom and checked it out and had Â lots of watery clear discharge come out of my right breast! Naturally I thought something was wrong and went to my gyn the next week. He ordered a mammogram, that came back with some findings of cysts in my left breast. They sent me for additional views on the left side and an ultrasound on both! Nothing major came back( just cysts) Then went back into the gyn and he tested the discharge and it came back atypical! So he sent me to a BS the, The BS ordered a MRI and nothing really came back except cyst so now the BS told me to put lotion on for the itching and come back to see him in 3-4 wks. last wk I went to a derm Dr and had a small mole removed, well it came back melanoma! So I called the BS and asked him if he could please go ahead with the biopsy of my right breast, He said he really wants me to try with lotion or an anti-itch cream, or go back to the derm. I feel as though I am not getting the right treatment from this BS!!!!! Anyone have any advice????? Please help after finding out about my melanoma I am getting pretty scared!!!!!!!! Thank You",
