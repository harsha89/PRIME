My regret is that I did not postpone this procedure and maybe avoid having it ever. I have also read somewhere in medical journals the stats of removing vs not removing lymph nodes for reoccurrence rate are similar. I wish I could remember where I read it. I wish I had a better info and more time to ponder before making my decision. Not removing nodes at the time of mastectomy should be an informed choice, I hope you agree. I have made an uninformed choice, hence my regret.",

      "Content": "florida_jo wrote: What prompted me to write about my lymphedema is an article I just read in Baptist Health magazine called \"Resource\" where onco surgeon Dr. John Diaz expressed his opinion regarding nodes removal and I quote \"Our research shows when we can isolate the sentinel lymph node and test it, leaving the other nodes intact, we can help patients avoid longer operations, bleeding and lymphedema, or swelling resulting from fluid backup.\" I only had 3 sentinel nodes removed, all clear, still have lymphedema. Suffice it to say, I was not ready for this post-surgery problem and dealing with it on daily basis. So many women have more severe cases of it, I probably should feel lucky, but here I am venting.

I now understand better and agree on the sentinel nodes being removed during mastectomy and the logical dye tracing that can only happen during mastectomy. I also re-read the article and am now completely with you. I will be editing out my post accordingly since it gives women wrong impression. Dr. Diaz talks about avoiding lymphedema when removing only sentinel nodes, not true in my case. ",

We are waiting for MO to decide on chemo before we cut that skin out to avoid 2 more surgeries, one for skin and one for the chemo port. We are waiting for Oncotype results as well. Meanwhile, I am recovering slowly, but there are signs of normalcy in my life. I figured out how to drive with my seat belt not pressing against my chest. That pain and sensitivity still there big time. I am pinching the seat belt by my left thigh with a heavy duty clip. That keeps the belt on the side of my rather than across. Slowly we get back to some form of normal, very slowly...but we get there all the while as you said it sucks getting there.",
