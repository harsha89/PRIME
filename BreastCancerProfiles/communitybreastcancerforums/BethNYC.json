According to her website, she made public appearances as recently as October 2011 at both Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's in support of BC Awareness month --- but there was no mention anywhere on Google of her having been diagnosed. I'm not being critical of her decision to keep her diagnosis private, but given her wide audience reach as a regular TODAY show contributor and via her books, it's amazing her diagnosis wasn't public knowledge and somewhat surprising that she wouldn't use her celebrity to educate other women. That said, it's really true ... BC doesn't discriminate, rich / poor, young / old, famous / ordinary ... condolensces to her husband, siblings and mother.",
