If so, could you tell me what happened to you during and after the radiation? Did you have radiation to the chest wall, the ribs, the axilla?  Any and all information you can give me would be appreciated. Thank you. Log in to post a reply",

It is  placed in the surgical site and it can give individualized radiation doses throughout the span of the device. It can be placed after surgery. Radiation is given twice a day for 5 days. The dose is higher but the amount of tissue exposed is more limited. A computer decides how much radiation the tissue along the device needs. Google the device and you will find a video explaining how it works.  My DCIS is irregularly shaped and it is 5 cm x 5 cm at its largest margins. I am trying to find a center that does radioactive seed localization and SAVI radiation, if such a place exists. I hope you recover well from your ordeal. ",
