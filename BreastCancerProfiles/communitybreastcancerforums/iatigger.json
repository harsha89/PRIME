I am still having weekly fills because the cancer side has decided not to be as stretchy as the other. I had hoped my swap would be the end of March but looks like that is out now. And this week was the first week since October that I have actually been uncomfortable after the fill. The muscle seems to be fighting back this time. And then my period showed up while on Tamoxifen. Now I have to call the MO on monday. She told me if I got it to call her so she can schedule an ultrasound to check for thickening.  Other than that I was in an organizing mood this morning and got an early start on my spring cleaning but now I am exhausted.

They took 8 sentinol nodes but all were clear as well as the margins. And since there was no node involvement I should be free from doing chemo. I am 47 and the oncologist I met with prior to surgery said it would only be Tamoxafen for me unless there was much greater involvement than expected. I see her on Friday for confirmation.
