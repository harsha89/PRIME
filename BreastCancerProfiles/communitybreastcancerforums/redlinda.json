It gets me into so much trouble especially at work (I am the secretary in a small office). My boss is becoming impatient especially since my last treatment was so long ago. I have found if I try to fight it, it gets worse AND I have found that I am emotional during that time too. Is there ANYTHING that my doctor can do to help?",

I sat in a chair and I couldn't remember if I was going out of the room or if I just came in. Sometimes I sit at a stoplight and I wonder if I am going straight or if I need to turn. When it gets that bad I ask someone else to drive. I have tried to make it funny. But, lately it hasn't been funny anymore.",
