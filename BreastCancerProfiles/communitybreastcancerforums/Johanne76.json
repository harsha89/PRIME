I have been having indigestion after my meals with a bit if burping.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me symptoms they were having when they were dxd with stomach mets. My path report shows no lymphatic invasion.  It's all so frightening and I really hate to bother you with issue.  I have tried searching the internet for clues but the info I found sounded like abdominal pain with regerutation.  I mentioned it to my doctor but they discount this perhaps because I was just diagnosed.  Any input would be helpful.  Thank you",
