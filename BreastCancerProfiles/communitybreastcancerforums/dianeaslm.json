I had 2 removed, then one more, and had to wait 2 weeks for last one to be removed. I do have some water build up that I'm hoping will subside soon. I have fleeting pains, but haven't felt along incision line. I still have the steri-strips covering my stitches. I feel like I have a vice going around the front of my chest and under my arms. It is really tight. I have dissolving stitches. My surgeon said I have to wait for 1/2 of each strip to curl up before removing them and stitches will dissolve on their own (allow 4 to 6 weeks). I am exactly 3 weeks out from surgery and am getting very tired of these things pulling so tight. I'm not using pain meds but probably would if I had them (or at least 1/2 dose). I am getting kind of irritable but I keep telling myself it will get better, eventually. Diane",

My doc said I could take off the strips when they curl half way but most of the ones curled half way are under my arms and are curled from the top down. These areas are the most tender so I've been afraid to take them off. Can anyone tell me how long they waited to take the strips off? Thanks, Diane",
