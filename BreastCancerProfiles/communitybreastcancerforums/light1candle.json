    "Content": "light1candle wrote: I am considering prophylactic bilateral mastectomy for LCIS and am wondering about what comes after. I understand that most women don't have regular imaging afterward, just maybe clinical exams or self exams. But what about anti-hormonal drugs? This may be kind of a dumb question, but I was wondering if anyone who has had a *preventative* bilateral mastectomy took anti-hormonal drugs afterward? I know that one of the primary reasons women choose preventative mastectomy is so they WON'T have to take these drugs, but I was wondering if taking them has any benefit at all, seeing as how BMx does not reduce risk to zero? Did anyone have a doc who recommended taking them after BMx? Dx 7/28/2017, LCIS, Right Surgery 7/28/2017 Lumpectomy: Right Log in to post a reply",
