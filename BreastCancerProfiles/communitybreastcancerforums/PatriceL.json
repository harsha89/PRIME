I had very long hair prior to chemo, got it cut very short the day I began chemo, donated 16 inches. My hair began to fall out about 12 - 14 days post first treatment. It began with my pubic hair, then armpits, and head. My scalp got a little sore prior to the mass exodus of hair, kinda felt like when you have a ponytail in too tight, you know? I wanted to keep my hair as long as possible, but decided to shave it off when it really started to shed. It was just a mess, hair EVERYWHERE in the house, coming off in big clumps. I didn't want to shave it, but felt so much better after I did. Gives the illusion of having some control of how you lose your hair.One taxol infusion in, I still have eyelashes and eyebrows but don't expect to keep them. Time will tell. Thankfully, we are in the cold weather time of year, so hats look pretty normal. Wear a hat or a wig, but cover up, baldness = coldness. Good luck to you, keep the faith and keep your soon-to-be-bald head up. It's all temporary. ",
