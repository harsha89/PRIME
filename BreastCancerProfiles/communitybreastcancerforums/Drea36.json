I also found the lead up to chemo more difficult than the treatment itself (so far). I found that the anti-nausea drugs made me wired and I couldn't sleep. I am on AC X4, Taxol and herceptin X4 and then herceptin for 9 more months. After all of that I will be on tamoxifan for 5 years. I am only 36 years old and have 2 small children. Anyone else out there with young children? How did people handle the diagnosis? I seem to be turning away from support groups and talking to other people with cancer (other than this site). I guess I am also so busy taking care of my little girls that I often don't have time to spend thinking about the cancer.Â ",
