My daughter came to me the other day and said her right breast hurt when she touches it or moves her arm to hand people money (she is a cashier and 17) Doc did a breast exam and did ot feel anything, but is sending her for a breast ultrasound Monday @ 830A. .Her doc thinks it is a cyst or fibrocystic tissue .My niece, she is 19 just had a pretty big lump removed from her breast. They could tell from the imaging it was fibrocystic, but was pretty big so they advised my sister that it should be removed. A coworker of mine also said her daughter had a fibrocystic lump removed when her daughter was 17, she is now in her 40's and no issues. My sister is 41 and has pretty big cysts in her boobs, she is leaving them, and one of her tatas is about 2 inches longer (bigger) than the other. She told doc she just thought she was lopsided and it does not bother her and to just leave it.",

I am guessing that there is nothing further I need to do. I cant even get the decency of a phone call.  Mediastinum: BBs were placed in the left axillary region around the area of palpable concern. Directly underneath the BB is a approximate 12 mm oval structure which probably represents a small lymph node. This has a very thin cortex with a large fatty hilum suggesting benign process. No other surrounding masses or fluid collections are seen. A few other subcentimeter lymph nodes are seen in the axillary region bilaterally. IMPRESSION 1. A BB in the left axillary region, in the area of palpable concern, directly overlies a small 12 mm probable lymph node which appears unremarkable. Bilateral axillary lymph nodes are otherwise identified and appears similar. No other masses or cysts are identified. 2. Lungs are clear. There is no mediastinal adenopathy. 3. Small hiatal hernia.",

The area of the \"lump\" is behind my pec muscle. It is scheduled for 7/7. So another freaking week of waiting and worrying. I cried all the way home. he said he is looking for enlarged lymphs and that the area of concern has no breast tissue in that spot. I think he if full of it... I have read people get lumps in this area.. It's under my arm right in my arm pit.. He even has a video explaining how cancer may never show in boob and only be seen in the under arm area. I guess ill find out sometine next week",

I finally got a call from my GP and she said she is not ordering any tests and that I need to go back to the breast surgeon and see what he wants to do.. Talk about a waste.. Now I have to take a few hours off tomorrow and see him when. I thought I was going to have either another ultrasound or MRI which I could have done before or after work. I am glad I am able to get tomorrow. I would like this over with. Thank you so much for the replies",

What worries me is that it feels large. Like a large grape.
