I can see that the person who posted had 2 other factors involved so I wanted you to be clear it is a VERY low risk. I had one after my TRAM but my PS never took me off Tamoxifen before my surgery. I then was on lovenox then coumadin while staying on Tamoxifen. My doctors felt if the Tamoxifen is working there is no need to mess with a good thing. As long as you go to have your INR checked regularly, like everyone else on coumadin is supposed to, you can successfully be on both at the same time... I was.",

If you're having a good response to current treatment, I'd stay the course. If you trust your onc, then trust your onc. Sure you should ask questions but their clinical experience may be different than another doctor's.   fyi I ended up leaving that onc after misdiagnosed liver mets that went on for almost 6 months then she sent me for a resection which was way too late... too many lesions to count (multiple abdominal nodes as well). The largest one on my liver had a 29 SUV uptake. She didn't know what to do then. She shared her chemo/AI reasoning in 2008 and I think it may be true. My current onc. does not use both at the same time either. I didn't ask why since I already have an answer that works for me. I'm currently NED (13 months now:) on faslodex/xgeva/avastin.",

I went for a second opinion after the chief medical officer (my doctor and internationally exclaimed BC specialist) of Dana Farber told me with his treatment plan I had up to 18 months to live. I recieved treatment at CTCA not offered at DF and came back home to Boston NED. In January 2010 when my cancer came back in my liver, a high profiled onc at Beth Israel in Boston (another Harvard research hosp.) told me I had up to 1 year. I went back to CTCA (where they also found brain mets) had treatment and went back to NED. I had a recurrance of liver and brain mets over the past year and a half which led to Y90 radiation to my liver and a right frontal craniotomy and IMRT but am again back to NED and on afinitor/aromasin. CTCA is in this fight with me. They have been as aggressive as I want them to be and ask for nothing in return. I'm on medicare with a BCBS supplement and have given CTCA $0 out of my own pocket. This thread was started with a negative undertone toward CTCA so I suppose not everyone would fit in here (it's really full of the most positive and happy patients - as well as employees - I have ever seen). It looks as though 7 out of 9 of the comments (all negative) have never actually been to one of their facilities which is usually the case when a conversation about CTCA comes up on-line(not just here but on a lot of forums)  Before my first visit, I was a bit sceptical... they never promised or even mentioned a cure... only that they would fight with me as long as I am able. They have certainly kept their promise with me. Best of luck to you all - Anne",

I failed Tamoxifen in less then a year, failed Femara in only 7 months, failed Aromasin in 6 WEEKS - I went from 2 small liver lesions to uncountable, all quadrants involved and now into abdominal lymph nodes in 6 weeks (I had switched to aromosin in hopes of staying stable as I awaited a liver resection) and after one year just found out I've failed Faslodex. So yes there are some pretty aggressive ER/PR+ cancers out there. Each person's breast cancer is as individual as each of us regardless of hormone status. - Anne",

In 2011 a PET showed a liver recurrence and the CTC only went up to 1. I went down to 0 again that november while my tumor showed stable on halaven. Once I showed progression (still on halaven), the next CTC was at 12... I switched chemo and it slowly went down. First to 10, then to 4 and finally back down to 0 - again at that point was NED. So now we know a 1 is significant for me so I will be scanned if I hit 1 again. We use it now as a response to treatment like any other marker.",
