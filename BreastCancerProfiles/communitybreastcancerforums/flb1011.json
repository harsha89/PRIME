Long story short, my husband called our family doctor on the 9th, told him the story, and he had him take me to the emergency room immediately.  Turns out I had a major staph infection, spent 5 days in the hospital again, had to have all the infection cleaned out and the expander removed, and I'm back where I started from.  Tired, in pain, and now constantly throwing up from the massive antibiotics they sent me home with.  Again, my experience I'm sure is not common, but you can't be too careful.  Good luck, Fran",

I have learned that we are all different, and that my recovery is just that, mine, and I will just have to let my body tell me what it can do or not do. I own my own business, a boutique, and luckily have a great staff.  They need direction, but I can do most of it from home, so I plan on doing that until I feel better.  I did go in today, stayed about 7 hours, much longer than I should, and I am paying for it.  I will definately do as little as possible for the next two days. I am blessed that I have a great supportive husband who has done EVERYTHING, and all 3 of my kids are home from college. I am going to try the suggestion of taking Advil every four hours without fail, and see how that works.  Also, the doctor says if I have less than 30-35cc coming out of one of my drains today, I can stop by in the morning and get it out, and I feel like that would be something to celebrate. My breasts are just getting to the hard as a rock stage which hurts as well, but I'm finding ways to sit that make it more manageable. All in all, thanks for all the support and great ideas. The cup IS half full. Fran",
