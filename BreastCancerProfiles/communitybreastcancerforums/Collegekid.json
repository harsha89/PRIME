A few months ago I noticed changes in both of my breasts (firmer, really really sore and sensitive, but I also noticed a lump on the left side). I chalked it up to being on a new birth control, and didn't worry about it. A few nights ago I noticed my left breast had changed shape significantly (it's normally rounded, but now had a flattened side). I called my doctor the next day. they worked me in earlier today, and the midwife felt around, said she felt a lump and that I needed to get it checked. So now I'm planning on making an appointment tomorrow, but with no insurance I have no idea how long I will have to wait to get in at reduced rates. I know bc is rare in younger people, but I've NEVER had my breasts change shape like this before. Anyway, I'm mostly looking for people to confide in since most people my age haven't experienced things like this. Thanks, Jenna :) Log in to post a reply",
