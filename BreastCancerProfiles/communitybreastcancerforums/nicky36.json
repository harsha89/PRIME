Man oh man I am glad that is done.  Tattooed and started Rads on Tues. Mar 04/08.  In it for the long haul as scheduled to get 30 treatments.  Using 100% pure Aloe gel.  Also started Tamoxifen on Feb. 25/08 and am getting some dandy hot flashes. Started swimming on Feb 27/08 and am trying to build up my strength and lose some weight. Scale is reading the same number as the past month but jeans and other clothes are getting real tight. Will be seeing a LE therapist soon as my passion is driving my motorcycle and I want to do everything to be able to continue doing so. Haven't been able to get much sleep over the past 3-4 months and am very annoyed by it so seeing another therapist to learn relaxation techniques so that \"maybe\" I'll get at least 5-6 straight hours of sleep every now and then. So as of today (Mar 006/08) I am 3 down and 27 to go.!! Nicky",

      "Content": "Oct 19, 2007 11:09PM - edited Oct 19, 2007 11:18PM by nicky36 Hello ladies, I'm not one that posts very often but I want to try and change that.  I think these forums are most beneficial to many of us having to go through this.  Although the answers aren't always here, just knowing that one can come here on those bad days and see that you aren't alone in this journey can make the load a little less taxing. Yesterday, I had the 1st of 6 chemo sessions.  My oncologist's recipe calls for FEC-T (or FEC-D - both are the same) then a short rest to be followed-up with RADS. The 1st of the treatments wasn't so bad.  I had not really slept the night before treatment.  I am one who will read, research and look into anything of importance when it comes to me, mine or close friends/family.  I put BC up there in that list of importance.  I guess as prepared as I was for this, the fear of the unknown just crept in on the eve of the treatment. Perhaps that was a good thing, because everything went without a hitch.  Other than a little heartburn and being tired last night (could be the drugs or the fact I hadn't slept much the night before), I must say that I feel as good as I did before the treatment. I hope this continues as it has only been 24 hours.  I know that the other side effects can and most likely will come on over the course of the next little while but you know....I'm just gonna roll with it because so far, so good, and I know that all of this is only temporary and that is what keeps it all good. On the way home from the treatment yesterday, I picked up a few cute scarves.  DH went back last evening and bought me 5 more because the 1st ones were actually very nice on me.  What a sweetie - he has been the best through all of this.  I thank my lucky stars everyday for him and am so glad to have him. I hope to come here a little more often so that I can get to know some of you.  I wish you all the best and that you all have a wonderful day today because I intend to and want it for you as well. Take care Nicky P.S.  I've just uploaded the new me - I had very long hair prior to all of this and so shortened it up so that I have some time to get used to the new look.  It's taking some getting used to walking past mirrors, windows - makes me chuckle because I feel like a kid with it!  WOW - sorry for being so looooooooooooong winded - I'll try not to be next time :-)",
