      "Content": "IADeb wrote: I was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer in my left breast one a year ago at age 51. I had a mastectomy, nodes were negative and low OncoDX score so no chemo, and am now on anti-estrogen therapy for 10 years. I went in for my annual mammogram on Tuesday (my first since my whole cancer ordeal), joked with the technician about how I should get the half-price special because I only have one breast now, and left feeling pretty good. So yesterday I get the call. They saw some asymmetry in my right breast and want me to come back for additional images and potentially an ultrasound. My appointment is next Wednesday, which ironically is the one year anniversary of my diagnosis. It's like a bad nightmare all over again. I keep telling myself they are just being extra cautious because of my history, but am kicking myself for not having a bilateral mastectomy last year. (The doctors all told me it would be overkill.) Does anyone know if it's more common to get called back for diagnostic testing on the other breast when you've already had breast cancer in one? By the way, this is my third call back in four years. Three years ago, I had a biopsy in my right breast that turned out negative. Last year, ultimately diagnosed with breast cancer in the left breast. Now the right breast again. Regardless of the outcome, I think I'm ready to go ahead and get righty removed, too. I don't need to go through this stress every single year.

Sure wish I would have went with my gut last year and had a bilateral mastectomy!",

My tumor was 3.8 cm so it must have been there for a while yet never showed up on 2D! I've had two false positives with the 2D (in the other breast) and one true positive with 3D. So I encourage everyone to take the 3D option if given a choice, even if it costs a little bit extra. Teddy88, thanks for sharing your story. I am hopeful that my docs are being extra vigilant and what they are seeing is scar tissue from the surgical biopsy I had 3 years ago. I hadn't thought about that until now, so thanks again for the input. It helps put my mind at ease. I will report back after I know more. Deb",
