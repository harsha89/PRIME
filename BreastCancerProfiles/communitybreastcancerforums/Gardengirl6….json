I also bruised a lot more with the biopsy ,than the partial mastectomy  and 3 lymph nodes removed. Wishing you all the best !",

My RADONCO RN gave me one of those crystal thingies to use for deodorant. It works okay as long as I'm not sweating like a crazy person (guess that'll come after I start the Tamoxifen!)

You might also have Cellulitist ....which is what I ended up being diagnosed with ....but both my doctor and oncologist said they have the exact same symptoms and visually you can not tell the differences.I had 5 biopsys samples done. I was put on a strong pencillian, twice,then it started to clear.....which took about a month to clear. It is scarey...both are serious situations....it also could be a rash from a bite....which is the first thing I was asked...or was I scratched. I was bright red, itchy, warm, orange peel, thickening of the skin, red bands... Please seek a doctors opinion , they really are the only ones that can figure it out. There are a lot of fabulous people on this site to talk to.... Till you get any results. Sending you big hugs and I will be thinking of you....hang in there...I know how you must be feeling .please feel free to message me. (((Hugs)))",

I think psychologically, men are just different from us. Their solution to just about everything is, \"Ignore it. It'll go away. Go to work. It won't be there when I get home.\" etc. I guess if they had cancer they would start working overtime just to run away from it! Paxton ~ you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned the fact that men typically want to \"problem solve\". They just can't understand that we actually want to cry about stuff sometimes! They act like tears are the worst thing that could happen to anybody! They automatically think they need to give us advice on how to fix the problem. They don't understand that's the last thing we want from them at that time! Poor guys. Honestly ... the female species really dropped the ball when they decided to let guys run the show.

I'll just grit my teeth and get it over with. But I had the choice. Sounds like it's not even an option for you. Bummer! As far as feeling close to the techs at the clinic ... I wasn't all warm and fuzzy with them, but neither did I begrudge them anything. There was one gal that rubbed me the wrong way, but the rest of them were okay. Hey all ~ I used Silvadene cream on the split/infected skin. It cleared it up very fast. Of course I was taking an oral antibiotic at the same time. I think Silvadene is intended to kind of have a drying effect though. That's why they gave it to me to put on the infection. It was all oozy and contiuously damp. The Silvadene kind of dried it up so it could have a chance to heal. If you're putting on the entire breast, have you found it to be drying to your irradiated skin? Miss Lolli ~ I'll eat the ice cream AND slather it on! After all, I am a hedonistic, heathenistic, heretic as my mother loves to point out! Methusala ~ You poor grumpy thing you! That's okay!

When a little, old lady, or cranky old man smiles their toothless smile at you, pats you on the hand, and says \"thank you\" it makes it all worth it. Like your daughter, I tried several different jobs after high school ... cashier, clothing store manager, bank teller, etc. I hated them all. Then on a whim I responded to an ad in the paper for a nursing home. I LOVED it! They trained me to be a CNA and I worked in nursing homes for several years. I went to work for a hospital after I got married and had kids, cuz the benefits and everything worked out better for me. That's when I decided to become a nurse. Had a few set-backs (divorce, single-parenthood, financial difficulties, etc.) but I was finally able to go back to school, and now here I am, just a few weeks away from graduating! I'm so proud of myself it's almost sinful! LOL! Had my second night of Tamoxifen last night. No S/E so far ... I'll see you over in the Tamoxi-train!",

My doc gave me an oral antibiotic and a topical cream. It healed right up, and all of the burns and other skin issues disappeared quickly after RAD's stopped. But the skin on my breast is still very soft and tender ... like a baby's butt! And after wearing a bra all day, I notice moisture around my nipple ... like when you sit in the bathtub too long and get all pruney. I'm not sure if this will go away at some point or what. You might want to have the doc take a look at the drainage and maybe take a culture of it to see if it's an infection. In the meantime ... I took a soft, white, cotton T-shirt and cut it up into little squares and lined the inside of my bra with it to absorb the moisture. Maybe that will help you a little.",

I can't remember how long it's been since I finished up treatment! 3 weeks? 4? Anyhoo ... the tan is gone now and the soft \"baby-butt\" skin is starting to get back to normal too. The nipple is still a lighter shade of pink than the other one, and the whole breast is a tiny bit smaller than the other one. It's full of lumps and bumps and dips ... I don't know how I would ever find an abnormal lump in there! Oh well ... nobody will notice. They'll all be staring as Miss Lolli pulls that toilet paper off her bizarre colored shoe! Man! I miss the 80's! How high did your bangs get girls? I only got up to about 2 1/2 inches.",

Get familiar with that new lumpy, bumpy thang! Barbie ~ I think I'm five weeks out of RAD now. My itching stopped by week 2, the nipple pain was gone by week 3 or 4, and the lightning bolts have turned into to tiny little buzzes that only hit every now and then. I don't actively ache, but if I have to reach up over my head, or reach behind me I can feel the tough tissue on the inside stretch and that hurts. Also, if I accidently lean against something, roll over on my tummy in my sleep, or if my cats step on my boob ... WOW! I get a quick, painful reminder! I hope you get to feeling better! I go to see the surgeon and medical oncologist tomorrow for follow-up. Will be getting the Tamox prescription. Follow up with radiation oncologist on Thursday. I think I'll be scheduling for my first follow-up mammo through the surgeon's office. And I think I remember an MRI is supposed to be scheduled too. At the time of my diagnosis, there was a \"iffy\" looking place on the opposite breast, but all mammo's and MRI's came back negative so we decided to take another look after recovery from this one.  Wish me luck girls!",

My family practice doc took a look at it and said it might be some kind of hive, but it's strange that there's only one. And I haven't used any new products, or done anything that might cause an allergic reaction. He told me to take an antihistimine and he gave me some cream to put on it. It doesn't seem to be helping. He said I will probably have to come back in for a biopsy. Yikes! Ya wanna know the silliest part of it?

She said the breast tissue was so soft and pliable anyone would hardly be able to  tell I'd had radiation. First time I've ever had a woman tell me I had nice boobs!

Haven't really felt too fatigued. Maybe a little. Am starting to feel mild to moderate nausea though. Didn't expect that. Isn't really bad though.

I've been a CNA for 18 years, but I still just couldn't hack it. My super very generously let me cross-train as a unit secretary. It's mentally challenging, but I'm sitting at a desk all day.
