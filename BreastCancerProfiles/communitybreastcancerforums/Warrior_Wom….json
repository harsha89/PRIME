We'veenjoyed a passionate sex life and I know he gets squeamish over anything that is visually unusual. 3D tats look normal from the front but it is noticeably different from the profile without a nipple.  For me, I also have concern that in the future I could feel that I was not made \"whole\" without nipples.  And so, little nips here I come!  With that said, I do want to speak out for those women who are deliberating over nipples whose husbands do want them.  There is nothing wrong with taking his preference into consideration.  It does not mean allowing someone else to decide for you.  Nor does it mean that you ignore what you want.  It simply means that you give consideration to both of your needs and hopefully come to a decision you're satisfied with.  ",

One I didn't feel at all and the other burned for a few hours. Jeni - I have no suggestions at all. I am weaning myself from pain meds because the withdrawal effects of pain meds such as percocet is an increased subjective experience of pain. I'm doubting that's the case for you. It sound more like you're one of the ones for whom the drain pulling was quite irritating to your system. As per the SNB, discussion, I had a BMX and the SNB was only on my cancer side. I don't know why it would be done on a side that shows no sign of cancer but I'm no expert. SNB is much easier than a dissection, as I'm sure we all know but still carries risk. My Onc Surgeon told me that with one node removed for my SNB there is a 5% chance for Lymphedema. 5% is very low but it isn't 0%.",

Envisioning myself healthy and athletic with perky boobs and no bra is what I need to do to stay hopeful. I had one lymph node removed a few weeks ago and it was cancer free.

I fair better when I know the experience is within the normal range even if I don't feel well. The big surprise for me was how unusually comfortable I felt upon wakening from the lymph node removal. It was only the anesthesia that made me feel ill. Aviva - You're absolutely correct. Nobody is going to post in the pain forum about feeling great. The internet is both a help and a hindrance. I like the study I read about women who opted for mastectomies. Years out and a very high percentage were glad they did. Thank you for my daily dose of sanity. Corpor - You're one day ahead of me. I'm hoping to be able to resume some activity in a reasonable amount of time. I've been running like a fiend lately in some wild attempt to store up the miles for when I'm stuck in bed. \"Brave\" plays over and over on my iPod. I too married a few years ago.

I also have an occupational therapist who helps me with regaining mobility and taking care of my home. She has given me different exercises that help with my mobility. All of this is covered by my insurance. I am mentioning this as I find it very helpful and reassuring to have professionals examine me regularly. Personally I think I look like Frankenstein but they're telling me I look good. If you don't already have home health care you may want to inquire about it. The reassurances are a comfort.",

Will2Survive - It is amazing how well most of us seem to manage afterwards. The anticipation has to be the worst part. I thought I'd be on life support but 10 days out of surgery and I was walking 3.5 miles at the gym (holding on of course). I have found this entire experience to be a waiting game. It is a cruel fate for a person who wants everything yesterday. Here's the deal - Whatever our reports say - we'll deal with it as it comes. Some reports are quite concerning and some are victories. I'm still waiting and waiting and waiting for the Oncotype. It makes planning my life a challenge. Velle - I had expanders placed so mine are different. I honestly expected I'd look like Frankenstein. Looking has made me feel not so bad about the whole thing. Perhaps I'll start mourning the loss of my breast at some point but maybe not. What I have now isn't too bad and it is still me. I'm sorry I cannot help with the drain discomforts. Mine are annoying but not painful. I don't know what makes the difference.

My favorite quote at the time was, \"Is my bald spot showing?\" Barremom - You look so cute and I agree ..nobody will ever know. Hortense - So glad to see you! You really helped me through this. Any tips you can share to improve my skin are greatly appreciated.",

The unfortunate reality is that most of us will not have great hair when this is over but it is something to work with and you won't be bald. I wore my hair up for a long time. It was too thin to wear down unless I pulled it back. I also wore ponytails and braids and barrettes and Mad Dana headbands in every color they have - http://www.mad-style.com/Mad-dana_c_153.html But you know what I never wore? A wig!

In other words, when Frank told me to use an aluminum free deodorant he was restating an internet myth. If you like organic deodorants that's great. But if you're like me and find that they are less effective than what you used formerly, there is no BC related reason to continue to use a product you're not happy with. I'm switching back to my Powder Fresh Secret. I'm all for making lifestyle changes to reduce recurrence risk but I'm not standing on my head because someone heard that being erect causes cancer.  \"Myth: Deodorant and antiperspirants cause breast cancer. Fact: Skipping these toiletries won't keep your breasts cancer free. One email rumor claimed that antiperspirant prevents you from sweating out toxins, which can then accumulate in the lymph nodes and cause breast cancer. But in 2002, researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle conducted a study to address this rumor\u2014and found no link between deodorant or antiperspirant and breast cancer. A second rumor speculated that certain chemicals in antiperspirants, such as aluminum and parabens, may cause breast cancer because there is a lower prevalence of the disease in developing countries where women don't use these products. However, toxins are not usually released through sweat, and in Europe, where antiperspirants are not widely used, the rate of breast cancer is higher than it is in the United States. Finally, although a 2004 study found parabens in the tissue of breast cancer tumors, so far no studies have shown that these or any other chemicals in deodorants and antiperspirants cause breast cancer.\"",

I was looking for patterns, suggestions, warnings and anything that would help me predict what would happen. Like you, I did the TC. I recorded everyone's data and paid particular attention to the TC women. I also read every published journal I could find. Here's what I concluded: Research shows women doing the TC do well with the caps. Hair loss ranges from very little and the most reported loss is 50%. I lost about 50% so I did not do as well as many. I'm mostly vegetarian and that could have made the difference...I don't know. No TC women in the studies lost more than 50%. And as you can see, with 50% hair loss, it does start filling in quickly. If not for the caps I'd be walking around today with a short curly cork screw hairdo. Some women can pull it off well. I'm not one of them. Also, I tracked patterns of hair loss. Some shed after each chemo. Some shed little during chemo only to lose a lot afterwards. And some, like me, shed a lot early on, were steady the rest of the way through and tapered off quickly PFC. I lost most of my hair day 17-30. I've posted this before but this is what I lost in just one day....  I was a weirdo who saved my hair in baggies. In fact, I was such a weirdo that after saving all my hair I did not know what to do with it and decided to make a hairy voodoo doll. And here she is....  The bottom line is that I survived this. My hair is looking good and getting better and you will survive this too. I have concluded that there are many different patterns of shedding and we're all predestined to lose our older hair. Some will lose more and some less. Some sooner and some later. It is horribly stressful to have hair sliding off your head. But then it stops. And we start to breathe again.",

Essentially, Aromasin has all the side effects of Tamoxifen and more. The percentage of people who lose hair and gain weight is higher with Aromasin than Tamoxifen. I did fine on Tamoxifen. Hot flashes was about it and I probably would have had those just from menopause. The hot flashes and sudden sweats are worse for me on Aromasin. So far that's all I've noticed but it's only been a few weeks. Joint pain is the biggie that most women experience with Aromasin. I take high doses of EFA so I hope it helps. I just don't want to turn into a fat baldy after all I've done to maintain my appearance. ",

My hair is one of my nicer features and it's back to being long, shiny and healthy looking. Wildflower - Tamoxifen has a lower alopecia rate by quite a few percentage points if I recall. It was on the insert but I didn't save it. However, my risk for recurrence is lower with Aromasin so I want to use it unless it become seriously problematic. Okay, jaw necrosis? Seriously? At some point medical professionals should just shut up. Read the Tylenol insert and suddenly the AIs are a walk in the park.  ",

Even though capping saves hair, it is so damaged and does take time to get back to normal.

I think you know that a BMX does not lower your risk of a systemic recurrence and we all have concern about that. Still, I did not want more mammograms and call backs so I chose the BMX. This was the right decision for me but not everyone. Part of my decision was also due to multiple diagnosis as indicated on my signature line. I feel good about my decision. Most women have tissue expanders and implants but there are many reconstruction options. After my first attempt failed I had flaps with my back muscles. That is not the first choice for most women but should you find that is your decision I am glad to talk with you.",

No one wants to be substance dependent. The approach to treatment for many years has been one of pain management and in the course of treatment many people became dependent on their prescription medications. The problem with the opiates is that the withdrawal increases the subjective experience of pain. EVERYONE who takes them develops a certain tolerance. Tolerance occurs with every substance. It's easy to see how a vicious cycle can begin. The pendulum has not swung in the opposite direction as the treatment protocols have not changed. Many doctors are more cautious given the alarming incidence of death by overdose. My docs will still hand them to me like candy and this is frightening. I've had 9 surgeries for BC and was loaded down with pain killers each time. They assume because I am high functioning that I won't develop a dependence. Anyone can become an addict. I've addressed this with them directly and the response is that they doubt I will. If I do I should alert them and me medically managed for the withdrawal. I've known more people who've died from addiction in recent years than BC. None of them sucked! Glad you got what you wanted, Marg. Proceed with caution.",

Diane - I waited almost 3 months from diagnosis to surgery and now it's been 3 weeks since surgery and no oncotype results yet.  Surely this is a conspiracy to drive me nuts.  Regardless of the results, I do expect to be far less anxious when I know where this is going and have more information about my own cancer.   ",

Unfortunately, there a more than two genes that are linked to breast cancer. The two most are familiar with are BRCA1 & BRCA2. Those are the ones they normally test for first. However, there are other gene mutations they will test for with individuals who come up negative on the BRCA1 & 2 tests. BCO just posted an article that covers the new guidelines for patient management around genetic testing. This link will take you there: Genetics You may want to speak with a genetic counselor. The counselor can advise you of a suitable path for your care. I have 2 mutations of the NF1 gene and it is linked both to breast cancer as well as some other cancers and other health conditions. The problem in my situation is that there isn't a darn thing I can do to prevent the other forms of cancer and all are fatal when diagnosed. And so, I now have information that only leads me to worry. I asked my genetic counselor not to tell me my test results unless I could use the information proactively. She ignored my request and told me anyway. You will read in the guidelines the recommendations for considering situations like this to avoid unnecessary anxiety for patients. Ultimately, a well trained genetic counselor will be able to talk with you and help you to make the decisions that are right for you. All the best for you and your family.",
