My turmor was 1.2cm at biopsy , they told me 3 lymph nodes were involved also. As it turned out my tumor was 2.2cm and 6 nodes were involved. They really won't know the exacts until you have your surgery. I had chemo, radiation and now have to take a pill for five years. What i can tell you is it has gone by so fast and it all was doable. Don't worry about it spreading as breast cancer is slow growing and a few weeks will not matter. I wish you the best of luck and let us know how it all turns out.

I have been coloring it for so long i wasn't sure what the real color is. I don't have the nerve to go topless yet maybe in a month (don't really know what to do with it :D) But very thankful to just have some hair.

Everyone is different, so for you guys that don't have much yet be patient it will come and once it starts it comes in fast.  Lago- I have problems with my two big toenails also.. At first i thought they were going to fall off and now they look like they just stopped growing. hmmmm.....I really don't want to go back to the foot doctor, so many doctors yada yada yada .But i  might have to.

I had really thick curley, curley hair and i used to use chemicals to straighten it all my life. It took me about 2 hours to fix my hair. If nothing else this cancer has taught me that i will NOT  spend that much money or time on my hair ever again!!! I thought when i lost it, that i would be devasted, but  the opposite happened. It was a relief!  Anyway i have been lucky, i don't use anything and i have almost 2 inches, i have had one trim and i tried to dye it myself, it looks like i dipped it in carmel on the top. Next time i will have it done professionally. It is still very curley and thick and everyone seems to think it looks better short, so i think i will keep it short, but not quite this short. I really would love some bangs. lol I think just like everything else with cancer, everyone is different. I hated when people would say that to me, but it is so true. I love to look at all the pictures of everyone's hair (i don't know how to post mine or i would) it gives us all hope. You all look so beautiful at all the stages!! Please keep posting. By this time next year our hair will be a thing of the past just like this cancer!! Have a wonderful evening everyone!!!                                                                          Pam",

I finished my 4th AC infusion 3 weeks ago and my eyes are swollen and tearing so bad, also my nose will not stop running. I went to the eye doctor and he gave me drops to put in them 3 times a day. It's been 7 days with the drops and they have gotten a little better, but they have not cleared up by any means. Sometimes my vision is also a little blurry, and i don't know what i would do if i couldn't play on the computer :). Tomorrow i start Abraxane x12 and i am worried that it will make it worse.

My regular doctor says if i get one more off to the urologist for me too. Are you on AL'S? I know what you mean by feeling pressure, when i don't have one i still feel the pressure. I also tested neg for one of them, but the doc did a culture to see if the infection was behind the bladder i think, or something like that, but that also was neg at the time.Maybe you can ask about having a culture done also. I'm sending you good thoughts that it will be no big deal. Pls keep me posted as maybe i can figure out what is causing my pressure too!",
