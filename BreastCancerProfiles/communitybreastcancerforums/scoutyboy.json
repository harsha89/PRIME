I just heard that \"they didn't see anything to be alarmed about\" from my MRI. So, I'm still scheduled for a surgical biopsy on Sept 19th. They need to place a seed in the location of the original core biopsy. I hope that isn't as painful. From what I've read on other posts, the surgical biopsy is more tolerable due to anesthesia. Thank you for the link about microcalcs. I hope all goes well with you on the 16th.",

The localization was pretty painful though. I guess it's hard to get the local anesthetic to the right places. The clip the radiologist put in to mark the needle biopsy site was way off mark. For some reason it went in much deeper, so it was no use. Instead of the planned seed localization, they placed a wire along the path of the needle biopsy so the surgeon could extract tissue all along the wire, hoping that they'll get some tissue from the site of the microcalcifications (which are no longer there). It's unfortunate since they'll be less likely to grab as many of the cells around the original site since they can't locate it exactly. I'll get the initial report in two days and have the post op consult on the 30th. The sports bra really helps--thanks for the suggestion!",

I'm sorry you feel bothered by the discrepancy in opinions between the two surgeons. But I think the fact that your surgeon had a different opinion than mine was not necessarily because one is right and the other wrong, but that there's a wide range of opinions, philosophies, opinions by surgeons. I don't think there's an absolute correct answer. Personally, I think mine may be too extreme. And each person's situation is unique. So I trust and hope your surgeon is considering what's best for you. But it comes down to our own judgment, ultimately. To clarify, my surgeon did NOT say I \"should\" get a mastectomy, i.e. there was no urgency; in fact, she reassured me that the news is relatively good given no actual ADH or DCIS. But she recommended the mastectomy IF I wanted to lower my risk factor down to normal women. Apparently, there is still a chance of developing BC even after mastectomy, but a normal amount of risk. And you may have read other posts here where high risk people have elected to get a mastectomy as a precaution, so I think it's an option for some people. Ultimately, I was grateful for the surgeon's willingness to answer a lot of questions and go over all the options with me. I hope you can get all the information you need from your surgeon. Or perhaps get a second opinion? I'm taking Evista as a preventative. No recommendation of radiation or anything else other than the 2xyear screening. I wish you the best.",

Last week I went in for a diagnostic mammogram for clear discharge from right breast. They didn't find anything on 3-D mammogram or ultrasound. But they found some calcifications in the opposite-left-breast (normal mammogram one year ago), so they did an image guided breast biopsy (stereotactic). I still haven't gotten the report so I don't have a lot of specific details but the nurse called the next day and said they found atypical lobular hyperplasia and atypical ductal proliferation. I asked if it was ADH (hyperplasia) but she said no, it was proliferation. I haven't been able to find anything about proliferation on line. Does anyone know what this is? She also said I didn't have DCIS, but from researching on line, it is possible they just didn't find it in the sample and/or pathology reports may vary so much that it may be DCIS. They recommended a surgical biopsy --going in for consult in two days and will know more then. I also understand that at the very least, I'm likely to be \"high risk\" given that my mother had breast cancer too. I suppose I can't know anything until I have the biopsy. But I'm worried now. The nurse said it should be in the very early pre-cancer stages so no need to rush to have the biopsy. Is it possible that I might have advanced cancer even if there was no mass detected, just calcification? I went from being happy I didn't have cancer to wondering if I might have metastatic cancer. This is all very new and scary. Any thoughts or suggestions would be very welcome. I guess I'm looking for a supportive community. Thank you!",

It does seem that opinions by surgeons/oncologists vary greatly. I was diagnosed last fall with ALH and something just short of ADH (some kind of atypical changes but not full blown ADH) and no BC. Yet, my surgeon suggested bilateral MX as a preventative measure given my high risk status (ALH, my mother's BC at 55 years old. atypical cells). Also, I imagine, they're never 100% sure they got everything. I haven't had genetic testing but I'm on Evista (postmenopausal). I haven't experienced any side effects from this medication, but since it's preventative, I forget to take it! I'm also doing the bi-annual screenings with MRI/Mammo. I agree, the more info you have the better. I, too, prefer to take an aggressive approach. It's a personal decision. I'm not sure about bilateral MX just yet, but it's helpful to hear what others are thinking. Thank you for sharing your decision making thoughts. All the best to you both. I hope all goes well.",

My pathology report came back clear but because of the uncertainty in locating the biopsy site, I can't be too excited. Right before the surgery, the dr. predicted we'd get benign results and I wouldn't be eligible for mastectomy-- I think she was encouraging it given my family history (mother) and they found ALH and ADH in my needle biopsy. I am impressed with those who have done the surgery as a precautionary measure. I'll consider it if genetic testing comes back positive. In the meantime I'll be on the mammo/ultrasound bi-annual schedule like many of you (thanks for sharing your stories), and will talk with the surgeon about drugs next week. I'm not familiar with the side effects. Are they hard to tolerate? Hoping for good results, LovesLiterature. Hope it's more definitive than mine. Hope you have a speedy recovery with lessening pain every day. ",
