I do notice less pain on that side now though. They said a collection of fluid is a risk for infection, plus it delays healing. But the fact that it was in the area of the newly connected blood vessels in my DIEP flap seemed to be the deciding factor.",

I got off the pain pump pretty quickly because I still had some nausea which was worse than the pain. Currently on Toradol and Percocet. Which keeps my pain tolerable. I'm able to get comfortable and sleep (in between Doppler checks!)I had probably 2 IVs and 1 or 2 other blood draws prior to surgery for pre-op testing. Plus injections into my breast to locate sentinel nodes. Ask for EMLA cream, especially for all of the outpatient sticks. It helped with the sentinel node injections! Since I've been in the hospital, here's what I've had so far: they put the first IV in while I was awake. While I was under anesthesia, they put in a second IV and an arterial line. The arterial line is how they'll take blood samples from you after the surgery, but mine wasn't working. So I had just one blood draw one morning so far. They also had to start a new IV today because I was down to only one and it started leaking. I know it sounds like a lot, but it helps to have people doing it who do them all the time! It also gets better every day. Such obvious progress is so encouraging!",

My path report specifically says \"expansive necrosis\" which looks like another way of saying comedo necrosis. I also asked my PCP about some of the other results that I was expecting to be part of the report (like HER2 results) to see if they are pending or still have to be ordered. I'm assuming that's probably a question for the breast specialist, but the PVP can probably tell me if tests are pending in the system. It's difficult to wrap my mind around having this diagnosis and just waiting...",

But I'm not sure what tests still have to be done before we come up with a treatment plan. I'm going back and forth between wanting to take it day by day and just wait for my first appointment vs wanting to have all my ducks in a row and research done so I'm ready at my first appointment with questions and an idea of what I want done. What I know from biopsy: DCIS intermediate grade with necrosis and calcifications, ER strong positive, PR weak positive As far as I know, it's just limited to one area of one breast. But they only did magnified images of the one area prior to telling me I needed core biopsies. I'm 42 with a strong family history of breast cancer (maternal and paternal sides), but no first degree relatives. I'm also BRCA negative--had that testing several years ago already because of family history. Log in to post a reply",

And I will page in the morning, but in the meantime it was kind of scary happen and I just need to just vent/ask about it. I woke up middle of the night to use the bathroom, and as soon as I sat down on the toilet, blood started soaking quickly through the stressing over my abdomen. I had DIEP flap reconstruction almost 4 weeks ago, and part of my abdominal incision is open. PS is aware and I am supposed to pack it with saline soaked gauze. But this is the first time it's ever bled. It seemed to bleed a lot, but quickly. And then it stopped just as quickly. Which makes me wonder if there was a hematoma under there that suddenly burst. I showered and removed most of the clotted blood and repacked it. I'm guessing it was around 30-40 cc's, but it may have been less. I don't know if there is anything else I should do right now. It was definitely not still bleeding because I checked the new gauze before I redressed it. There was some additional pain in that area yesterday, but I just thought that was some sensation returning or something. I'm still too freaked out to say if that pain is any better now. I'm kind of afraid to move around much. Log in to post a reply",
