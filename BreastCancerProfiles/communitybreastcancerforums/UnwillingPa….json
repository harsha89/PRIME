My tumor is large enough to be painful.  I spent from 5 PM to midnight in the ER recently getting IV pain med, and came home with a prescription, so whatever happens after port insertion, I think I can handle.  MFallabella, I'm so glad you started this August group - thanks!  I am feeling a lot isolated, too.  I'm much older, and kids are grown, 2 live out of state.  My hubs works M-Th & Sat., so I'm alone all day. I live in an over 55 community, and I'm not very active outside my home.  Most people here are just too OLD to be fun company.  I am geeky & crafty, love to cook, and I swim like a fish.  I have 4 beautiful grandchildren that I adore, ages 2-13. At least I've gotten a lot of clothing prepped which helps me stay sane.  I cut several tees down the center front, added a woven fabric band on each cut edge, and mounted plastic snaps for closing it so I can have port-accessible shirts.  I live in Florida, and it is not all that easy to find button-front casual knit tops here.  I'll do the same to a sweatshirt for winter wear.  I was sent a dignity robe from someone who makes and donates them near Houston, Texas, and I will make a pattern from it so I can make some to donate.  They have Velcro down the center front and each side seam, so only one side needs to be opened for radiation.  I make fabric baskets like this one, and I'll have one in the car as my chemo bag, and one for other supplies needed for our chemo trips.  We live over 70 miles from the cancer center (one reason I'll be very resistant to doing daily radiation therapy - I'd have to drive myself, which will be hard since my husband still works and needs the car), so my hubs will drive me there on Fridays for chemo.  On another topic around here somewhere I read that diarrhea can be sudden, severe, and we need to have a change of clothing, towels, wet wipes, tissues, and lots of plastic bags with us.  Hubs says I'd better buy some Depends, too.  I will, because we do have a long commute. I insisted that we not take the turnpike, because the back roads have lots of retail, restaurants, and gas stations along the way where I can get cleaned up if necessary.  Can this get any more embarrassing?  I made a \"Cookie Tossing Can\" in case I get nauseated on the way home, but I will take the antiemetics before I leave.  I have plastic bags, and I'm lining a plastic coffee can with them, held in place by a rubber band.  I buy the Great Value Twist Tie bags anyway, for all the bread and rolls I bake.  They're a good fit.  I have several caps/hats ready, and I plan to make more for myself and for donation.  I took a millinery course in high school and have made hats for years, so that part's easy.  I have fabric sitting on the table, looking at me, waiting to be made into a quillow, (quilt-pillow) but that's the one thing I dread doing.  I don't like sewing large projects.  It would be perfect for travel; it folds into thirds and tucks into its own pocket, making a pillow.  My large basket/beach bag will hold it nicely, along with other comfort items and water. I see the MO this Friday for an hour, to discuss my regimen.  We WILL discuss Taxotere heavily, among the other drugs, and I will beg him to use another drug.  He has already said that all his patients on drugs that cause neuropathy sit with their hands and feet encased in ice bags, and that they don't get peripheral neuropathy.  I cannot afford the cold caps.  The FDA is now requiring the company to add the warning on the packaging about the possibility of permanent hair loss.   I imagine there will eventually be a class-action law suit; there are at least 15 law firms online trying to sign up clients.  At my age I feel I can afford to be a bit choosy about all this. I'm 73,  still have no need to color my naturally curly hair, and I don't intend to lose it permanently.  I can deal with a color change or texture, but having none is not my style!  I'm old - but I haven't quit breathing yet!  I will ask about when I can expect \"hairfall\", and my youngest son who lives nearby agreed to shave my head with his clippers before it happens.  I'm not sure how long it will take for me to look in a mirror.    My other subject with him will be a sleeping pill.  I only sleep a max of 4 hours, sometimes less until after about a week I'm so tired that I get through one night.  Perhaps I also need a little Valium on the side?  AnnieTater - I wish you all the best - what a load you have, girl!  Be strong!  The GOOD part of all this is that we have a place to come to share the good, the bad, and the ugly.  I'm glad to be among friends!  Thanks, all, and HUGS!   ",

I wanted to do a lot of sewing today, but that lack of sleep has me looking/feeling like a zombie.  When I do sleep, I dream about chemo that hasn't even happened yet, and it is disturbing.  I have a tip for those of us who experience severe diarrhea.  (I know, it's unpleasant to discuss)  TP will make us sore in a hurry, so I decided to make a \"redneck bidet\".  I got out a plastic squeeze bottle (kitchen tools aisle, WalMart), filled it with water, and will use that directed to the right place.  It works!  I bought a large jar of Aquaphore ointment for rads later, but have been using it on my very dry Florida flip flop feet, and will never go without it again!  I use body lotion first, followed by the Aquaphore.  It will also be a soothing moisture barrier for a sore bum.  For the other extreme there's always this:   LOL!

Hubs and I will need to pack a lunch to take with us, too, I think.  I don't know yet what time of day I'll be getting my treatment.  I did some research about nasal cavity cancers, and learned that TC is also the regimen of choice for that as well as BC.  My nurse nav is going to coordinate efforts and see if she can get someone to see me on Friday.  I need a biopsy.  Worst case, I'll have it done here and have that doc refer me to whoever nurse nav gets for me in Orlando.  My local cardio doc's office did my echo so I wouldn't have to make the trip down there just for that.  Has anyone here been put on B6 to help prevent the peripheral neuropathy?  It is on my list from my MO, plus I will be icing hands and feet during infusions.  MO says his patients just don't have a problem with PN when they do that.  I will take a large cooler with me; thankfully, it is on wheels!  I will be dragging a lot of stuff in with me, but I'll have my big teddy bear Hubs to help.  I definitely think the chemo room should be on a palm tree lined patio, where there are lounge chairs and waiters to bring us tempting morsels of chocolate and iced drinks.  Some of you have said you have pain when your port/line is stuck with the needle.  My MO prescribed Emla cream, which is a prescription local anesthetic that is VERY powerful.  They do surgical procedures after you've had it on your skin for the required length of time.  I wonder if I'll use it instead of injections for my port insertion.  The longer you have it on our skin, the more powerful the effect, and it can last for many hours.  Numb is good.  If I had it now I'd stick some up my nose! No sleep last night - no sewing today.  Must get on it tomorrow.  I'll need that quillow.",

Sensitivehrt - that was  scary, having a reaction!  I'm so glad it turned out well. I'm out of here at 6AM for the long drive.  I hope I'm back here tomorrow evening to check in on everyone.  Be safe; have a good day, ya'll.    ",

Tomorrow:  At 11:30 I have a brain CT, followed by a maxillofacial CT at noon to see why I still have this infection in my nose.  While I was on the phone with all those folks I had a paper towel stuffed up my nose because it was bleeding again.  They could not have started chemo anyway with an active infection going on.  I have many positive things happening, and that feels really, really good!

I would hardly know I have a long scar on my breast, as it is not bothering me at all.  I am so relieved that size and shape wise, it is blessedly normal looking.  He glued all my incisions together so my skin looks funny, but I can shower because there are no sutures.  He also removed a skin lesion I've had for years that bothered me, so there's a third scar.  The axillary scar shocked me at its length.  He only took a few nodes, he said, and I wonder if he trimmed my toenails while he was in there, LOL!  I will get the pathology report Friday or Monday.  I know the scarring would have been much less if I had gone through chemo to shrink the tumor and node first, but I simply could not face the rigors of chemo and the risk of any of the adverse effects becoming permanent.  I will not complain about scarring, and I am more content now that the tumor and lymph nodes are gone.  I've never worn a bikini anyway, and I'm too old to be vain about these scars which won't ever see the light of day.  I sincerely hope that ya'll are having a better week so far, and I will continue to get better by leaps and bounds I'm sure, and I'm hoping you will, too.  AnnieTator - I'm so sorry you had such a difficult time with diarrhea - I hope that's the end of it.  Hope - hurray for you getting whatever wig or wigs make you feel confident - it made me happy for just the one evening I had some to try on, and I am happy for you!  Dara, you're doing such a fabulous job of keeping track of everyone - you are just wonderful!  Thank you!  It is difficult for me to keep track of all, but please know I am thinking of you and wishing you the very best, and the fewest SEs for everyone!  Lisbeth - How shockingly awful that you were so abused by any nurse!  It infuriated me to read how you were treated!  She should be reported, and I hope you do!  She has no business working with cancer patients in particular, but probably shouldn't even be a nurse at all!  I SO wish you could be using my cancer center - UF Health Orlando Breast Cancer Center.  (UF = they are affiliated with the University of Florida and its research center and medical school) They've been voted by women patients as the number one center in the US for the past two years.  No nurse or anyone else there would ever treat you the way your nurse is treating you!  From janitors and cafeteria workers to department head surgeons, everyone is ultra kind and gentle, and goes out of their way to take us wherever we need to go.  We are all pampered, every minute we are there.  After our chemo class, our group all agreed we felt we are wrapped in a warm blanket and have every need or desire met from the minute we walk in the door to the minute we leave.  Our nurses all have master's degrees and extra training in oncology on top of that.  They have every support service you can think of, and all are absolutely free.  I think they just LOVE us into good health!  I'm an R.N. of 42 years, and I've never seen anything like this breathtakingly beautiful center anywhere in my life!  (By beautiful I mean the people, but the physical structure is also very beautiful.)  So, this is where I want to move, so that I can be a volunteer at this phenomenal place someday.  I know I want to sew some beautiful chemo/radiation shirts and hats for breast cancer patients, but I also would love to work there as a volunteer.  As I have always tried to do as a nurse, I want to comfort, and teach, and be an advocate.  My surgeon dad told me on my graduation to \"Comfort many, cure some, help all\".  I'm not through yet. ",

I've decided I'm very fortunate to be on Medicare and have a supplement, and with both, everything is covered, I believe, but Medicare didn't elaborate on their website.  No co-pays, no deductibles on my plans.  My only concern is hitting the donut hole with my prescription drugs (chemo meds are 100% covered).  I'm not sure the extra drugs will be included with the chemo meds, but at least I will start this year and finish next year, which gives me a whole new drug period.  Before all this started, I only took one inexpensive prescription, so I have never gotten to the donut hole.  I did some more homework on the chemo meds today.  Instead of looking at the usual drug description sites, I looked up \"adverse effects\" instead; that's different from the usual SEs.  I discovered why we get steroids - it is to prevent really bad adverse effects like anaphylactic shock, which can happen when you're allergic to one or more of the drugs.  I've been in anaphylaxis three times for 2 wasp stings and 37 fire ant stings at one time.  I won't skimp on the Decadron, and my MO has listed my dosage at almost maximum.  Gulp......  We went to Lowe's tonight to buy a long-lasting wasp killer, as they are coming after me like gangbusters lately the second I open my front door.    I had an eye exam by an ophthalmologist Friday.  I have been on glaucoma watch for the last 7 years, and it finally happened in one eye, so I have another one, just an eye drop, on my \"regular list.  25% of one optic nerve died, even though it has only been 4 months since my last checkup.  I have an exam with an ENT on Monday.  I have a very sore lesion inside my nose  that has been bleeding for a couple of months.  Not a good sign.  Cancers do happen there; my dad had one, had it removed and a graft placed over the wound.  Just by breathing in those cancer cells, it spread to his lungs, and he died from what was a skin cancer.  I hear hoof beats, but trying to think horses, not zebras.  I hope they got they far up when I had my PET scan, but I'll have them take another look on Friday.  We seniors have a much higher risk of having shingles under the best of circumstances.  I sent an email to my nurse navigator to ask her if I can get the vaccine before we begin.  I think they'll say no.  Wish I'd thought of it sooner - it is expensive, and you never know if Medicare will OK it until you order it.  I'm having a problem with my settings - it repeated at the bottom, got some wrong, and I can't seem to fix it.  Will try again.",

Not content to just give me the TCH treatment, I will be getting my PHD - Perjeta, Herceptin, and Docetaxel.  I know I will be on Herceptin for a full year, and Perjeta for up to 40 weeks.  I think it is time to pick out a wig.  I guess I won't see hair for at least 15 months, and probably 18 months before I can go without a cap or wig.  My surgeon called me a couple of weeks ago after I had decided to not pursue any treatment at all.  He talked for 17 minutes straight, and I could not get a word in edgewise.  He kept saying that I am curable.  He would not stop until I agreed to go back.  He kept saying that they are curing those with my set of parameters.  They don't use the word \"cure\", in my experience as an RN for over 40 years.  All I could do was sit there and sob.   Evidently I qualified easily for Perjeta because of my particular parameters, as it is not generally available yet, and because they are part of a major university medical research department.  There's more information here: https://community.breastcancer.org/forum/80/topics/846661 Why have neoadjuvant treatment?  My tumor is now 3.5 cm.  I'd have a lot of breast damage if I had surgery now.  It would probably require a quadrantectomy, which is taking 1/4 of the breast, or perhaps I'd lose half. The neoadjuvant treatment, my SO says, is shrinking tumors dramatically; he says by the time that therapy is finished, there is often no tumor to be found.  There is no necrotic (dead) tissue left behind; there is nothing left.  He will take our my sentinel node and 4 or 5 more unless they find cancer in those, in which case he will take 20-25.  I'm hoping that he won't have to open my breast at all, but just the area where the positive node is next to it.  Here's what I learned that is astonishing to me:  they do lymph node transplants there if people develop lymphedema.     ",

Then, off to my surgeon's nurse/PA to learn about my port insertion and care.  I already knew about insertion, where it goes, blah, blah, and there was a short summary about showering for the week after insertion, and more importantly how to prep my port for chemo.  I have been given a prescription for Emla cream, which is lidocaine and prilocaine in a cream.  It is an uber-strong local anesthetic that is applied one hour before chemo starts, then covered with plastic wrap to keep the cream from being lost on clothing, etc.  The longer it is left on, the more numb you become.  It can be left on for up to 4 hours for surgical procedures, but I'm not to do that!  I can smear some petroleum jelly around the outside of the port, too, so the plastic will stick even better.  After lunch, we had chemo class with a group of us newbies.  It covered all aspects of medicating, dealing with side effects, nutrition, knowing when to report something, etc.  They never heard of pickle juice use in chemo.  They, especially including the MO, HIGHLY recommend the following:  1 cup of water, 2 teaspoons of honey, and 2 teaspoons of apple cider vinegar.  They said warm water; I think cool would be more appetizing.  They want us to bring a bottle full of that mixture and sip it during chemo and any other time we feel nauseated in addition to our antiemetic drugs, and lots and lots of water; at least 100 oz. per day is the recommendation.  We had a tour of the patient library, the community support center, and the infusion floor.  There's a boutique for bra fitting, mastectomy supplies, wigs, and lots of other things for breast cancer patients.  The infusion rooms have space for 4 people in each, who can each have a companion, and quite a few private rooms for those too vulnerable to infection to be with other people.  They are very, very nice.  I sat there remembering a beverage I made last summer called a shrub, and wonder if that will work.  It will certainly taste better.  You simply chop 1 cup of fresh fruit (I love blackberries),  add 1 cup of sugar, and let it macerate for a day or two in the refrigerator.  Strain it and use just the resulting syrup.  Add 1 cup of apple cider vinegar, shake well, and return to the refrigerator for a day or so, until all the sugar is dissolved.  Add some club soda to taste and serve over ice.  I usually added more sugar, but I'll try honey instead.  I couldn't get my fill of these for weeks!  Use any fruit; berries, peaches, plums - all are good.  I'm going to try this for nausea. They also added 1 tsp. of glutamine powder twice a day to up protein intake.  It can be mixed with a smoothie, plain water, or juice.  I'll get 1,000 units of D3 twice a day, and 100 mg. of B6 twice a day, too.  My large backseat basket is half finished.  I had to go back to the store for more interfacing, but its going to be BIG.  I also have to make a larger meds bag.  My prescriptions had to be ordered and they'll be ready tomorrow.  I asked the doc about Claritin.  He said no, that he prescribed a large RX only dose of Allegra instead (180 mg.); said it works much better than Claritin for bone pain.  I listed all my home meds, the instructions for taking them, and the chart for the steroid schedule on an index card and laminated it to keep in my meds bag. I got a new pill storage box to keep each day's meds in.  I will use my beach bag as a chairside bag to hold lemon drops, some roasted almonds, my tablet, a book, maybe some lap-top crafts, a journal in which we are to record any side effects to drugs, what works and what doesn't, and any comments we have.  Whatever will keep me occupied for all those hours!  My journaling and any questions will be addressed by the MO at each session.  We'll take some ice with us and buy more there for icing me and my lunch.  Frozen grapes might not last, though.  Also will send Hubs for popsicles; plain ice gets old.  I get my port on Wednesday.  My first treatment is on Friday.  Gulp.

Now I have a question: I was sent home with an ID card showing I have a power port, a key ring tag advertising the same thing, and a silicone bracelet which also advertises it.  No way I'm wearing that thing.  But I am really concerned that they sent me home with a \"Power Loc Safety Infusion Set\" in a sterile package!  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT THING?  I was given no instruction at all!  I was too groggy to know to ask before I left, and I am going to heave if anyone tells me I have to stick a Huber needle into myself!  My infusion R.N. said to keep the power loc set  in case I ever need to go to another location (I live in hurricane-prone country) for an infusion or if I ever need a particular type of scan and they don't have that equipment.  I'm keeping it.  Since my first infusion, I feel better about having the port, and it did not hurt when she put the needle in.  I had used my scream cream, and she uses a cold spray to numb it also.  I was shocked at how much pressure is required to insert the needle!  It's like a punch in the chest!  I'll be better prepared next time, and it should get easier, I hope, since I am on weekly infusions for 12 weeks.  I'm not so repulsed by the port anymore, although I'm calling it my \"starboard\" since it is on my right side.  They will also work with my cardiologist and I won't have to have his phlebotomist do my blood draws anymore because the infusion nurse will also do my cardio tests and send them to my cardiologist.  There's a benefit! ",
