I have a wig that I'll probably start wearing to work either way. Thanks!",

I'm just now getting my appetite back a little and getting past the diarrhea that plagued my first several days.  I'll be going 5 more times three weeks apart; not sure what happens after that.  Probably surgery. (I have Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer.) Looking forward to learning and contributing here.",
