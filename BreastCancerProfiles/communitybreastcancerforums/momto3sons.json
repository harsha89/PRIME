This all started with an architectural distortion discovered on a diagnostic mammogram back on 12/19. I had an MRI-guided biopsy last Tuesday, and that brings me here :-). My BS said the normal course of action is removal of the radial scar and ADH, although since mine is only 2 mm she said in the end it was my decision to do it now or take a wait-and-see approach. I decided I'd rather go ahead and take care of it now, so I'm scheduled for an excisional biopsy on 2/22/18.",

The journey started thanks to my 3D diagnostic mammogram showing architectural distortion in my right breast. I had an MRI on 1/18/18, and that confirmed the area of concern. This was followed up by an MRI-guided biopsy on 1/30/18, and I got my results on 2/2/18 - I'm the proud owner of a radial scar and atypical ductal hyperplasia! I met with my breast surgeon today, and she reviewed my results with me. The biopsy confirmed fibrocystic disease, which the doctor is obviously not concerned about. But with the radial scar and ADH she said the normal course of action is to have the area removed by excisional biopsy. I have that scheduled for 2/22/18. Has anyone else here gone through this?

I was recommended for a biopsy after AD showed up on my 3D diagnostic mammogram, but the u/s didn't show the AD. The dr also didn't feel a lump, so she wouldn't do the biopsy yet. We're waiting to see if insurance approves a breast MRI.",
