I'm 47 years old and have been recently diagnosed, on 2/7. Haven't found a tumor in my breast (having breast MRI Wednesday)  My cancer was found when I had a couple of swollen breast lymph nodes. Five nodes were removed. The surgeon thought it was just infection, but turned out to be cancer.   So had a CT Scan and Bone Scan, both were good. Mammogram was also clear.   Then PET Scan showed cancer in nodes up to my collar bone, my neck and chest. Also showed cancer in the bones. I know in spine and ribs. I was to scared to ask if in any other bones. Since bone scan was clear and Pet Scan wasn't, had a spine MRI which confirmed spine   Then I found out I am also Triple Negative.   (How can a bone scan show clear when Pet scan and MRI don't?) Reading on here, it looks like there aren't as many options for ppl that are triple-. Also when I look at everyone's signatures most ppl that are triple- aren't stage IV.  This really scares me.  Do I not have much chance of surviving this a long time.  Sometimes I feel cheated finding out I have cancer and that it's Stage IV..  I didn't have a chance to fight it in the first stages when I could have beat it. I have had one AC treatment, my next one is 3/30.  I do have pain in my back and ribs on last side.  and have had it for a couple of years. but I always thought it was because I was getting older. Dr will also start giving me zometa with the next treatment this week.   Three more treatments, then I wonder what's next?  He hasn't told me yet. Thanks for listening and letting me vent. dx 02/07/12 ER-/PR- HER2- lymph nodes in breast, neck and chest. bone mets on spine and ribs. Began AC 03/08 4X every 3 weeks and Zometa. not sure what will be next Log in to post a reply",

For a couple of months I had felt a lump under my arm, but I had a sinus infection so I thought it was a part of that and kept ignoring it.  The lump started hurting, so i finally told my dr.  He ordered a mammogram since I had not had one in over a year.  The mammo came back fine but the lump was very uncomfortable so he sent me to have an ultrasound the next day and made me an appt with a surgeon  that afternoon after the ultrasound. Had the Ultrasound on 1/31 and went to the surgeon. The ultrasound showed 2 inflamed nodes.   He said it was probably just infection and said if it was bothering me we could remove it if I wanted to.  I said I did. So he removed them the next day, Tuesday 2/1) along with 3 other nodes and sent them for biopsy.  He even told my husband while I was in recovery that they were full of infection but he thought he got it all. On Monday, 2/6 I went to have the bandages removed. He had gotten the report back and they were positive for cancer. He was as shocked as I was, I think.  So the next step was the next day, 2/7, I had a CT Scan of my chest, abbdomin and pelvis and  a bone scan.  Results two days later showed that both tests were fine.   On Monday, the 13th, he presented my case to a Breast Cancer commitee and they decided that I should have a PET Scan as well. I had that Wednesday and today I got the results back.  It's in more breast lymph nodes, up to my collar bone and some others surrounding my breast.  Still saw no cancer in my breast. Also saw some spots on my spine but the radiologist couldn't say for sure that that was cancer and remember my bone scan was fine.  It's in no other lymph nodes other than the ones associated with my breast. I have my next dr appt Tuesday.  He is going to schedule an MRI of my breast just as another precaution.   Then it will be to an oncologist to begin chemo. I haven't seen a pathology report yet. Not sure when I will, but that is on my list of questions for Tuesday. I know if it is on my spine, I'm probably not going to be here long.. But I keep wondering, how could it be, if it's in no other lymph nodes.. How could it have gotten there.  I've been reading about staging and from what I can tell by reading it's stage 3B or 3C which is right before Stage 4.  And if it is on my spine it's stage 4.  Also now,  I keep thing of things and wonder if it's cancer.  Scared I had signs.  How could I have not have noticed things before it got so bad.  I am so scared right now.    dx 02/07/12 ER-/PR- HER2- lymph nodes in breast, neck and chest. bone mets on spine and ribs.

I went to the oncologist last week and this week is going to be a whirlwind.  He suspects that the spot  on my spine (and there were other spots as well) are bone mets. But says he can't be sure until more scans are done after I do chemo. Remember my bone scan was fine. PET scan showed spots.   The lymph nodes affected are in my neck, my chest on the left side and the breast lymph nodes up to my collar bone on my left side. I get my port tomorrow. Tuesday I go back for chemo training. Wednesday I'm having an MRI of breast and spine. Thursday I start chemo.  My husband is home.  He came back when I got the PET scan report. Not leaving to go back until we see how I react to the chemo.   ",

It makes it harder because my husband isn't here.  He is working 13 hours away. He was here on vacation when I had the biopsy, but because the surgeon seemed to think it was just a lot of infection he left the day before I got the results. Then the day after I got the results he turned and drove back.  He stayed until I got the results of the CT Scan and Bone Scan and left again this past Monday.  I have told him to stay until I have the MRI.  Then when chemo starts he will probably have the company fly him home for a few days each time I have it.  Unless it makes me sick constantly.   ",

I'm still just trying to get a hold of this thing. finally coming out of the shell shock of being healthy one day and over the next 2 weeks finding out I had Stage IV. Can't wait for whenever they do new scans to see if chemo works. My 2nd treatment is this Friday.",
