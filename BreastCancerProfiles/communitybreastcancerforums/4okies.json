Regular, so to speak of radiating the site or sites everyday for 26 treatments and then doing a boost dose of radiating the insision site, for a toal of approximately 7 weeks. This is what I did. They other two options were mammosite and catheter site where they actually radiate the inside after baloons and or catheters are put in place and is done twice daily for 1 week only., but your sites have some stipulations in regards to size and symetrics, as to whther or not you are a candidate. I could have been, but then I would have had to travel about 120 miles to the nearest facility, so this is a consideration also. The regular rads went well. USE LOTS OF CREAM 2-3 times a day. Biafine was given to me by the doc. Unfortunatley, by week 4 I has pretty red and swollen and somewhat painful and then when the fatigue hit my like a brick a week later, I did not know how I was going to go on, but with a little help from my friends and looking at the light at the end of the tunnel, I did. I never did blister, but remianed very red until my last treatment. The boosts showed a very distinctive red spot where the bean was then directed. Interesting enough my skin began to turn tan afte just one week of ending rads and thing began to feel better. Dont be alarmed though. but it is common to still have some swelling and pain for quite e few months and fatigue to go along with it. I am not trying to scare you but I was not told everything at first. I think the docs only think we can handle so much at once, but they kept adding to the side affects. #1. radiation ruins your sweat glands and hair follicles, but hey, no shaving or deodorant needed on that side any more. #2. Your radiated breast will always be a little more plump and full. #3. heart problem may not show up for about 10 years out and I already had a myocardial bridging and angina, so I will just continue to monitor with my heart doc. #4. The say you can get a cough or lung problem right away but it should go away afterwards fairly soon. Of course there is the possiblity of broken ribs, but they will heal and other lung problems which they can treat. It seems like my list kept going on and on the closer I got to the end and kept asking. Then. I enede up with lyphedema. I was told that radiation can ruin any good nodes you have left on the affected side, but not alsways. It ruined mine but hey, they can treat that too. I better stop now or you might just want to back out all together. PLEASE DONT. Just take it one treatment at a time and you will get through it. Everyone will react differently at different levels and some get no side affects at all. I really wish you the best, but keep asking your radialogy oncologist when ever you see them, as during the treatment they will examine you once a week to keep tabs on you. ",

Here is my understanding. They first want you to see the surgeoun, to see if your problem is directly related to the surgical procedure. I did and he thought I had mastitis infection and gave me antibiotics and pain pills. 1 month passed to no prevail. I then went to regular doc who did blood work to rule out bone mets and then xrays to rule out broken bones or ribs and determined that it most like just inflammation. He gave me mobic and pain pills. Then I finally get to see my Oncologist another month later and he said that although all my blood work was normal I should be concerned about the swelling and he order an MRI, of course my insurance would not cover the MRI right away until I had a diagnotic mammo fisrt. I have both within the next week. As both came back with NO EVIDENCE OF DISEASE OR CANCER, yea!!!, my oncologist then basically washed him hands about my continual pain and his nurse said perhaps I should see my OBGYN. Well, The heck with that. I immediately called my RADiation Oncologist and she, although relunctantyly; diagonsed me with Truncal LE and kept saying how she thought I would never come down with it as I only had 3 nodes removed, but had to admit, that it was indeed LE so she sent me for treatment. I specifically asked her if the MRI could diagnose LE and said NO, it is diagnosed by clinical signs during exam. I then read about truncal LE and if I had read this months ago, about the collar bone and shoulder pain, I could have been treated much earlier and I would have been more informed and apparently not by my docotrs who I think should all be dentists because it is like pulling teeth to get information from them. Pain is the most common and there does not neeed to be any or much swelling at all. This is what I have figured out about having so many doctors all for the same disease of Breast Cancer. They are all so specialized and afraid of stepping on anyone elses toes or proving that someone else is at fault that they are afraid to make a frim committment or diagnosis of what they should ALL be trained on as the BIG picture...your complete health and ALL aspects of breast cancer, surgery, treatment recovery, etc. I do not know why most of them feel the need to act like this, but with my oncologist, I have learned, since I do not currently have a cancer mass and my surgeon is the same. (He does surgery, that's it!) or any signs of then HE CAN DO NOTHING FOR ME.",
