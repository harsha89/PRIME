I know you can sympathize with the fears I have for my children. My oldest just finished college and is an L&D nurse, but even she still needs mom to help her navigate life. Her boyfriend just asked for permission to marry her. She doesn't know yet. My 18 year old son is the ultimate middle child! He can't even put his dirty clothes in a hamper, but he is \"an adult!\" And the \"baby\" is my sweet, happy go lucky 11( almost 12) year old son. It is hard not to be paralized with the fear of what if...My husband is wonderful and I couldn't ask for a better partner and father for my kids, but they all still need me.You have definitely made me feel a little less alone! Thank you!",
