The nurse said that the radiologist had compared my mammogram to the mammogram that they had taken last year and there was significant change. She said my breast were very dense and that there was a lot of calcification built up on the side of my right breast. I didn't think calcium build up would be anything to worry about, (I haven't ever heard of that being found in the breast before), so I asked the nurse and she said that they wouldn't know for sure until I come back for another mammogram. I am scheduled to go back at 1:45 today. I have been on HRT for 14 yrs, I had to have a hysterectomy when I was 28 yrs old, nothing to do with cancer, just a lot of female problems after my children were born. I was just wondering if anyone else on this forum had been dx with calcification in the breast before and what the outcome was for you. Log in to post a reply",
