Then chemo ended,chemo curls grew in almost black,to now the mousey brown.I tried a small area of Loreal,and it did nothing.I even resorted to cheap Sun In.Still nothing. I only had a few grey hairs prior to chemo,and that seems to be the same in post chemo hair,so grey isn't the issue as much as my hair refuses to be dyed or lightened. Very strange and frustrating. Anyone else have a similar problem? Thanks,",
