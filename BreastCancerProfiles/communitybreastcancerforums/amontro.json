The price was manageable. Some pharmacies that know what you're going through will go over the costs of meds with you and work something out. Otherwise, you can also try aspirin which is one of the all time best meds, if you can tolerate it.  I have no use for tylenol, ibuprofen, advil, etc., and they're bad for the kidneys/liver. Also, it's ok to feel sorry for yourself. Have a pity party with us on this thread. we're really the only ones who know what you're going through. I've just given you my two cents for free. ",

I go to work, stimulated with Percocet, but it gives me some purpose. As blondie alluded to, at least I am able to afford a vacation once in a while. I have that to look forward to. Recently, a lightbulb went off. My grandson has begun college and we talk more often than I ever imagined we would about his plans. Then I realized that perhaps I could help cultivate him in a non-interfering way.  I started thinking about having him join my SO and me for trips we could take with him.  Then I put the reins on. I could do this if I spend some of my savings,  or I could save better and last longer. Anyway, for a short while I believed my purpose was to help my grandson.  Only the near future will tell. Good luck to all of us. I hope we find what we need.",

I took my last pill (I'm supposed to take 3) on Thursday. then I called the office again on Friday again \"to give the message to the doctor\".  I called Friday afternoon to speak with the office manager (as my psx requested I do when I'm not satisfied with the staff).  She said she had the request for my meds on a pile in front of her and would call my pharmacy that afternoon. Tuesday I was contacted by the pharm and when I picked up the meds, there were only 18 in the bottle.  I'm suposed to get 90 (3x a day). The pharm tech told me that my pharm did  not run out of pills, and the doctor requested that I only get 18.  That's unbelievable because he knows I'm doing so well with my meds.

I wanted to be buried with one of my relatives and the person who met the criteria was my grandfather who died in 1927.  The only glitch is that I have to be cremated to be buried with him. My daughter is a devout catholic and doesn't like cremation, but the church allows it if you'll be buried in a cathoic cemetery and not sit on a mantle, or scattered to the 4 winds. What I saying is that my family will be the ones who attend my funeral and come to visit my grave.  I had my daughter's input when I picked out the stone for my grave. Grandpa did not have one so his name is first his 3 yr old baby who died same year is second, and my name is third.  My DD wanted crosses in the corners. When I am ready to preplan the funeral I will, again, have my DD's input. She will be the one who will be there. My son and other daughter will find the closure in the ceremony that they've been through with other relatives. I'm trying to save my family money by doing these things ahead of timethen they can just show up. I'm still at loose ends as to what my obituary is going to say - either a lot, or just a one liner. P.S. I need another update for my will and don't feel like spending $3-500.",

If you had not lived your life as you did, everything would have been changed and you may not have had the same experiences. I've always thought I should save more money for retirement.  Then I've thought suppose I die sooner than retirement?  So, here I am with very little retirement money, but a lot of memories of how I spent my money for enjoyment. I'm still working at 71 so I can have extra money to buy what I want.  There will be enough time to frugal when I have to quit - and i will have to quit when my Stage IV progresses, and it will.",

Since they extend to the rear of the panties, there is coverage for some leakage. They've been a blessing while I'm at work and they have caught small accidents. I particularly use Always Infinity Overnight Longs with wings. They are extra long so don't place them too far in front, they'll extend to the back, and the wings keep them in place.  Also, the back of the liner is wider.",
