I'll be having dose-dense A/C 4x followed by Taxol 4x, followed by radiation. I was supposed to have a DIEP flap done during my mastectomy, but the sentinel lymph biopsy was positive, resulting in axillary dissection and the need for radiation, which meant reconstruction had to wait. My breast surgeon did not advise me that positive lymph nodes meant that reconstruction would be postponed, so it was quite a shock to wake up without a breast that I was expecting to have. And then to find out that the four \"mild\" chemo sessions (with no port) I'd been advised of had turned into 8 weeks of a more harsh regimen requiring a port plus now radiation... I was doing pretty well mentally/emotionally prior to my surgery, but not so much since then. Last week I went for a second opinion about my chemo regimen. Although I am node-positive, I am premenopausal (46 yo), ER+ >99%, PR+ >99%, HER2-, and my Ki-67 score was a low 5%. I've read studies that say lymph-positive cancer below three nodes \u2014 I had two macrometastases (one with extranodal extension) and a micrometastases in a third \u2014 may not be recommended for chemo in a case such as mine, but my primary onc had told me that \"no oncologist would recommend against chemo in your case\" and thus did not do an Oncotype DX. I'm a little mad about this. The second opinion onc said she would have done an Oncotype. So I don't really know what to think. I've done so much research my head is spinning, and onc#2 told me I know more about breast cancer than most doctors. Medical science here is not exact and it is hard to know what to do; onc#2 was very upfront about this uncertainty and said she would be agonizing over the decision if she were in my shoes. I am very concerned about the potential for heart damage from the Adriamycin; I have read that it can be progressive even decades after treatment, and I have several risk factors (family history of heart problems, I'm overweight, plus the radiation will contribute). But after looking at this board and reading about people who had reoccurrence after not having chemo the first time, I keep thinking, well, if I opt against it and the cancer comes back, I will really kick myself for a stupid decision. Onc#2 said the fact that I had positive nodes on a cancer that otherwise appears by the numbers to be non-aggressive is something to consider... what made it spread? I am going to talk to my oncologist about these concerns before treatment begins Wednesday (the holiday meant I wasn't able to get a consult appt with her to discuss it before the chemo date). Her nurse told me when patients get a second opinion she will usually call and talk to the second doctor, so I'm not sure if that is going to happen before my chemo in this case. I'm grateful for all the information compiled in these threads. I have a better idea of what to expect and how to plan for it now, at least. My thanks to those who did this work for all of us. I am enjoying my last weekend of \"normalcy\" for a while before the next stage of this journey begins.",
