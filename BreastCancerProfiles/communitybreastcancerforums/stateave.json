I'm \"realllly\" thirsty...boy does that ever go away? found out that what is in my left breast is a begnign (sp) of lobular carcinoma and non-invasive, she said this is a \"marker\" for cancer that the marker means it could be in either breast. They found the cancer in the right. She (surgeon) said she wouldn't do anything with it. It's not going to go anywhere or do anything it just means you have a high chance for breast cancer (which obviously I did) she said most of the time they find this marker then they find the cancer. But it was the opposite with me. Anyone ever heard of this or been in this situation? She thought it was really strange that I was thinking about it or wanting something to happen with that. If it's just what she stated maybe that's true. Had my neulasta shot yesterday that wasn't too bad. It burns a little going in but that's it.",

Got all ready, ate a sandwich, bought a bottle of water and gossipy magazine to read and met my husband, we walked up all ready to go and the systems at the center were down, they moved all the patients in current treatment and had to reschedule me to tomorrow. I know they can't help it but I wasn't a happy girl. I want to get this started! So I'll be off again tomorrow at 1pm. I'll let you know how it goes! Kimberly",

I never seem to find \"big\" scarf's confused about tying them ect... the two I bought have ties in the back to tie from. I'm in a hot area. Thought about a wig but wondered if it would be really hot so I opted out. Doesn't seem to be a lot of places in town to go look for stuff.",

And low and behold my head started to itch, it's like a sunburn up there (that's how it feels anyway) and I started to have hair fall out. Is this a couple of day occurrence or am I going to be bald tomorrow? (silly question I know). I'm contemplating not working for the rest of the treatments. This really does wear you out. Hopefully today will be as good as the first. The hair thing I think is going to be really weird and tramatic though. (I know I'm feeling the \"drama\" right now). From what you all have said and I've heard I'm sure I'll get over that.",
