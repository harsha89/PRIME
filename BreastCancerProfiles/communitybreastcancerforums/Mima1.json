Had never heard of it but he talked about cosmetic advantages along with better radiation outcomes Has anyone had recent experience with this as noticed this thread is a few years old now Any advice on this option both positive and negative would be appreciated My breasts are pendulous these days but not huge, though not A or B cup either",
