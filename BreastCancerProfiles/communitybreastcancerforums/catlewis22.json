(i have a couple we knew about that I was told was just lypomas) he also mentioned some slightly swollen lymphs. He sent me a week later (wed) for an ultra sound. Thurs they called with an appt at the cancer center to meet with a surgeon. He's not concerned with the lymphs (not so big) he didn't like the shape of the lump though and sent mt to have a vac assisted core biopsy yesterday. One radiologist didn't seem too concerned, but one did. Hard to read. The beast care coordinator was great and said she will contact me asap with results. They didn't check the other breast because it wasnt ordered. I am scared they will miss something. I can't seem to get out of my own way today. Worried and waiting. Cat L. Log in to post a reply",

Waited a week then had us. The next day got a call with an appt to the cancer center to meet with a surgeon. He was only slightly concerned and sent me for vac assisted core. Had that yesterday the two radiologist were very nice. They seemed to be worried that it is solid and star/ irregular shaped. It's small 5cm. Kind of deep, near my breast bone. The assure me I'll have the results by friday. I think I'm most scared not that it is something, but that they will miss something else. Why can't they just do a pet scan and get it over with??!! I'm 42 living in Maine with two grown children and a great husband. Boy is this nerve wracking! Thanks for listening!",
