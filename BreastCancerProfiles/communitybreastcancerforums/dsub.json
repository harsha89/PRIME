      "Content": "Oct 19, 2012 01:38PM - edited Oct 19, 2012 01:47PM by dsub i have a question about lung mets. I have recently been shorter of breath than normal(last 5 months). I am a smoker. Signing up at local hospital to help me through the quitting stages and the meds. My nail beds are bluish/purpleish with a pale white toward the top. I have shoulder/upper lung weight or dullpain. I can't walk up my back yard without getting out of breath. I was sent to a cardiologist to rule out heart conditions. Passed with flying colors, although the treadmill test was a b***h. I was sent to local hospital for a breathing test. Coughed alot on that one. With my smoking, COPD/Emph. seem to fit the symptoms. Last lung x-ray was in July. dr. said was clear. Should I ask for an MRI or a CAT scan? I do not see my Onc. until January. I have already had three different types of cancer, cervical, vulva and last but not least, Breast Cancer. I am paranoid at the thought of it coming back. Nails haven't looked this way even when I have had puemonia. Coming up on my 5 year mark. Tumor markers have been a little up then back down. It wasn't high when i was diagnoised either. On PET breast cancer showed as a 3. Subclaviclar lymph node was a 2. lymph nodes by cancer breast didnt show up at all and was poorly differentiated. No other treatments besides CMF chemo. Tamoxifen had me crawling the SE's were so bad. Took me off it after 3 moinths. I had vascular invasion as well as perinual invasion. Still don't understand those to well My dad had lung cancer, left shoulder hurt and ached. they gave him steroid shots before the actually found the lung cancer.",

How have ya'll fared and what, other than my anti meds can help me thru this. I can't talk to family because they will either get scared, youngest, or tell me not worry. Therapist had a stroke. now I have to break in a new one. Surgery was in March of 2008. Last chemo Oct. 2009. Not taking any horomone. Tamoxifen had bad side effects with me. I have \"Sheehan's Syndrome\" so therefore my immune system is compromised.  I think that scares me even more.",
