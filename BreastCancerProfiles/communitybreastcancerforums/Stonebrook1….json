I was lucky that my PS does that and that I could have it done. I can tell you that there really is no pain just a feeling of tightness and from the implants and the surgerical vest that I was put in and sent home in.  The only pain I really had was where the tubes for the drains came out. Once the tubes were out I felt so much better.  I heard some ladies talking about being wrapped in an ace bandage after surgery my PS uses a vest that zips up in the front. I was able to buy speacial bras at at a shop that deals with mactectomy products. The bra has velcro on it that you attach pouches that hold the bulbs from the drain tubes and the ins. company pays for them if your DR. writes a prescription for them.",

My BS did skin sparring and my PS did direct implants not tissue expanders. I was like all of you so scared of the surgery. But, it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. I was so afraid of being in pain. I can honestly say  I didn't have much pain at all.Just stiffness and tightness across my chest. I now I'm numb across my new Foobs. The SN injection did hurt! And the drians weren't that bad I had 4 of them. But that was the worst part of everything. I even went home the next day. You can't really sleep lying down so if you can buy a wedge pillow. Or take the cushion off the back of a chair and lean it up againest your headboard then place your pillows there it much more comfortable. Down pick up anything heavy for the first week. Just take it easy if you can. If I can answer anyones questions please PM me or email me at Stonebrook108@aol.com So many woman were so helpful to me on this web site I would like to help if I can.Good luck to all of you.

The gauze kept the bacatracin on the stiches and your able to hold down the tubes when you tape them flat. My husband would do it for me after I showered it worked great.

That's what I didn't want to happen to me so I had my PBM with direct impants. I and never regreted my decision. I had LCIS and the stress of all the testing every 6 mons. for the rest of my life would have been too much for me. Not to mention they want you to take Tamox. I feel I took the easy way out for me. It was the worst decision to make but it is doable. It's a personnel choice. Also, It's not the BS who decides what reconstructioln you will have it's the PS. Remember I was the one who sent you the list of questions for the PS. The surgery was half as bad as I expected. Really no pain expect for the drains. I'm also sending you a PM. Good luck",

But, no matter what it had to be removed.The new name for it is lobular neoplasia. I know just how you feel. I was scared out of my mind. Take your time and get all the info. you can on it and then decide what's best for you. My husband was great and so supportive of my decision. I chose to have a bil. mast. with direct implants and be done with it. That was back in Jan. this year and 5 months later I feel great. But, my choice isn't for everyone. Some women want to do the tamoxifen and testing but I know that was too stressful for me. This is a great site and it helped me so much. I wish you all the best. Send me a private message if I can help you. Ann",
