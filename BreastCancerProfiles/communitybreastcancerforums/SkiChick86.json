      "Content": "SkiChick86 wrote: Hi everyone, My saga is fairly long but essentially I went in today for an ultrasound of a large lump that I was previously looked at (via ultrasound) in April. At that time I was told it was just regular fibrocystic breast changes and they left it at that - no mammogram or further testing. I have since gotten pregnant with my second child (I'm 19 weeks along) and have had some bloody nipple discharge as well as pain which prompted me to go in again. The lump may have grown as well, I'm honestly not sure. At the ultrasound they found two masses that weren't there at the previous ultrasound. They did a mammogram and the radiologist came back and told me she is almost certain it is cancer due to the calcifications she saw on the mammogram. She ordered a biopsy and I am having it done tomorrow morning. I will hopefully get the results by Friday afternoon. However, at this point I am operating under the assumption that it is indeed cancer. I am in shock and obviously quite terrified for myself, my pregnancy, my two-year-old son, etc. I tried to listen and take in everything the radiologist was saying, but I wasn't able to get everything and I had some questions come up after I left. I will try to clarify all of this tomorrow, but in the meantime I am wondering: 1) Do you either have DCIS OR invasive ductal cancer? Or can you have both? The radiologist noted she saw quite a bit of DCIS in the mammogram but there are also two masses. I am assuming the masses mean it has spread beyond the ducts and is now invasive (and therefore no chance of it being stage 0). 2) Does anyone know anything about the likelihood of cancer that developed quickly during pregnancy being estrogen receptor negative? I read that cancer in young women (I'm 30) is more likely to be ER-, but my mom had ER+ cancer in her 50s and I am thinking that mine likely was activated/aggravated by my pregnancy. Thoughts on this? I realize these may be doctor-only questions, but I am new to all of this and pretty desperately seeking answers where I can find them, so I appreciate any thoughts or responses in advance.

I had a similar situation - the radiologist told me it was cancer but I had to wait for the biopsy to get definitive results. I spent those days doing whatever I could to distract myself which meant binge watching Parks and Rec on Netflix and going on long walks. I agree with what Scwilly said, stay off Google especially at night. I need to be better about heeding my own advice on that one, but I am working on it. It is also important that you know that if it is cancer, there will continue to be waiting (waiting for the full pathology report, waiting to meet with doctors, etc.). I say this not to let you get discouraged but to prepare you. I had the idea in my head that once I knew it was cancer for sure things would be easier but in reality it has been more waiting. Just to prepare you. I have heard from a lot of wonderful ladies on this site that it does get better once you have all of your results in and you can start on a treatment plan. Until then, finding a way to distract yourself is the only thing I can suggest. My fingers are crossed for you that it is nothing and you get to move past this and feel an awesome sense of relief.",

Initial imaging made it look like I had one, maybe two nodes positive. I had my mastectomy on Thursday and while there was a good response to chemo within the breast, they found cancer in 4 out of the 8 nodes they took, including extranodal extension. One sentinel node had 9 mm of cancer and one other node had 8 mm, the other two had scattered cancer cells. I'm pretty disappointed to be bumped into the Stage III category and having a hard time with the fact that the AC didn't take care of it all (I know it's not likely in HR+ cancer, but I was still hopeful). I am so thankful to hear about all of you who are doing well, and also to learn about potential trials and other options. I'm currently pregnant and will be having my baby in about a month. Then I'll be doing more chemo (Taxol) followed by radiation so I know I have some fighting still to do. But its terrifying to think that most major treatment will be done in a few months and then its just hormone therapy. Like many of you, that doesn't seem like enough given how extensive my cancer was and the fact that it was still there after AC. Thank you for all of the information and I look forward to following this thread!",

I asked them to re-test the hormone receptor status and the original tumor is now 15% ER+ and 40% PR+. The KI-67 dropped to 65%. I know a drop in KI-67 is a good thing, but I'm wondering if anyone has any idea what it means that my ER receptors stayed the same but my PR receptor increased. My thought is that it's good - I know hormone positive cancer is less likely to be killed by chemo so I'm thinking that the chemo killed more of the non-hormone-positive (i.e. more aggressive) cells - but I have no idea. I would love any thoughts or experiences you might have!",

I know I will feel much better when I have a plan in place and a better idea of how serious this is. BG46TN, I appreciate hearing about your friend. I hate that any pregnant woman (or really, any woman) has to go through this, but it does help hearing success stories from other people. Also, it is good to know that there are additional genes that can be tested. When my mom had her diagnosis 10 years ago they only tested for BRCA. My dad died two years ago of a very weird and rare cancer so it is certainly possible that I got something from him. I am already scheduled to meet with a genetic counselor next week. Lintrollerderby, I am very much hoping that my cancer is ER+, but it is good to know it may not be. My mom's was ER+ and PR+ so I have a good idea of what that treatment may look like which is probably fueling my hope that it is similar to hers. Ajbclan, thanks, I hate it too! I will try to find the woman from your board, I really apprecaite the tip.",

My mom just got to town and she brought all her testing info from when she went through this 10 years ago. I will definitely ask for as much testing as possible. Additionally, I'm wondering if those of you who have been through this know anything about the likelihood of a stage 4 diagnosis. I don't think it's very likely but that is my biggest fear right now. I have no reason to think it has metastasized beyond one or two lymph nodes (none were swollen on the ultrasound, one had some calcifications and they biopsied it and it was possible) but since they can't do the sentinel biopsy during pregnancy I am worried they didn't get the sentinel and it's in all of them. I may be a bit paranoid at the moment so any data or background on the likelihood of stage 4 cancer at this point. I really appreciate everyone's support!",

I appreciate everyone who takes the time to share their experiences with those of us who are new to all of this and scared. I am 30 years old and 17 weeks pregnant with my second child. About eight months ago I found a very large lump in my left breast. I had an OB appointment scheduled anyway a few days later and my OB referred me to a Breast Health Center for an ultrasound. The tech told me she saw normal breast tissue and that I probably just had fibrocystic breasts. The radiologist confirmed. After that I noticed that that the lump would grow and shrink with my cycle and I didn't think much of it. I also noticed discharge with a brown tinge on the inside of my bra from time to time. Since getting pregnant, the existing lump has become quite a bit larger and has been tender and painful at times (but not consistently). The other day I took off my bra and noticed blood-tinged discharge on the inside. I called my OB and (via her medical assistant) she recommended another breast ultrasound. The ultrasound is scheduled for the 3rd. In the meantime, I am concerned because everything I am reading says that bloody discharge from one nipple + lump = bad news. I also realize I may have been having bloody discharge for some time without realizing it. For anyone who has gone through this, I am wondering if anyone has experienced bloody discharge with fibrocystic breasts. A lot of what I've read says that while discharge with fibrocystic breasts is normal, it isn't normal if it's bloody. I'm also wondering if anyone has experience with similar symptoms and pregnancy. There isn't a lot online about pregnancy and nipple discharge and a large lump all together. And, if anyone has any words of wisdom to stay sane when I'm freaking out, I would really appreciate it. Oh, and for a little background, all of the women on my mom's side of the family have been diagnosed with breast cancer over the years, although they all were diagnosted post-menopause.

I went in for my ultrasound today and they found two masses. They followed up with a mammogram and the radiologist said she is almost positive it is cancer. I am having a biopsy tomorrow to confirm, but based on what she saw she went so far as to say if the biopsy came back negative she would question those findings. So, thank you to everyone who provided support here. It looks like I will likely be moving over to the \"diagnosed\" section.",

I had my first meeting with my oncologist on Tuesday and we're starting chemo this coming Tuesday. I'll be doing AC for four rounds over 12 weeks (since I'm pregnant they don't want to do the growth factor that allows you to do the treatments every two weeks, so mine will be every three weeks). I am so anxious to get started. I'm certainly not excited but I'm happy to be doing something. I got my port put in yesterday and am doing my orientation to chemo on Monday.",

The infusion itself wasn't bad at all, but now I'm sitting around waiting for symptoms to show up. I had quite a bit of heartburn overnight but I'm not sure if that's from the chemo or the pregnancy. Thisis4menow - I completely understand what you mean about hanging on by a threat. Most of the time I feel fine but then I see something medical that makes me realize that this is real and it's happening to me and I lose it. I had a really hard time the first time I saw the infusion center two days ago. The center itself was nice, and I've seen an infusion center before when my dad was going through chemo a few years ago. But seeing all those sick people and realizing I was one of them was really hard.  Ann-sg - Good luck today",

I was diagnosed on 1/6 and will be meeting with my oncologist on 1/17. However, everyone I've spoken to seems to think we'll do chemo first, and soon. My cancer is very aggressive (grade 3, KI-67 80%) and I did have a positive lymph node during my biopsy, so I am very anxious to get started and feel like we're doing something to fight this. My situation is complicated by the fact that I am 20 weeks pregnant, however chemo still seems to be the preferred first step. If you don't mind answering, how long did it take between your meeting with your oncologist where chemo was decided and actually starting? Things have generally moved pretty fast so far (I had my first appointment with a breast surgeon scheduled two days after my diagnosis) and the only delay has been getting in to the hospital that will be treating me, because they do multidisciplinary appointments for your first visit and they only schedule them twice per week. I know that before I start chemo I will need an EKG and a port placed, but I'm not sure if anything else needs to happen before we can get the ball rolling. They will not be doing a sentinel node biopsy because they can't use the dye on me while pregnant and the surgeon I spoke to seemed to think they would wait on any sort of node surgery until I do my mastectomy which will likely be after the baby is born. So, can anyone think of any reason why it would take more than a week or so to get things going? Thanks in advance. I'm so sorry we're all here but I am so appreciative of all of you and what you've written already. It has been very informative.",

I take the full week of chemo off - Monday to get my life together, Tuesday for chemo, and the rest of the week to rest and recover. I had my first chemo last Tuesday and I honestly didn't need the full week off (but I'm going to keep taking it!). I felt fine Wednesday and Thursday morning and only started experiencing symptoms Thursday evening. I also had very, very minimal symptoms in general so I might be an exception. I am now 10 days out from chemo and my blood cell counts have dropped and I am definitely very tired so working the last few days has been hard. I would say if there's flexibility with your job go for it! You may find some days are great and others are tough, but as long as you feel able to call in sick on unexpectedly hard days I don't think it shoudl be a problem. I have found work and being around people to be a really, really nice distraction.",

I didn't have surgery in January but I am in a Facebook group for chemo starting in January and a member of this group recommended I ask my question here, so here goes. I am currently 27 weeks pregnant and planning to have a mastectomy (left side) at the end of April. My baby is due at the end of May. I am hoping to baby-wear him/her as much as possible as I also have a toddler running around the house as well. I wanted to see if those of you who have gone through a unilateral mastectomy felt like you could wear a baby (or a backpack if that's easier to visualize) one month or so after your surgery. I'm trying to decide if I should by a sling carrier which will only go over one shoulder, or just assume it won't happen for a while and wait until I can use the double-sided carrier I already have. Thank you so much in advance!",
