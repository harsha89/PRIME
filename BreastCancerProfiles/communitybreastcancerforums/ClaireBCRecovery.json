    "Content": "ClaireBCRecovery wrote: Hi, I wanted to make sure you all know about a wellness retreat for women with metastatic breast cancer.  The retreats are run by Breast Cancer Recovery, a non-profit based in Madison, WI.  Our main program is called Infinite Boundaries retreats, 4-day wellness retreats designed by survivors for survivors.  We are offering two retreats solely for metastatic women in 2009.  They offer a chance to connect with other women, massage, creative arts, discussion groups and low-impact yoga.  The fee for the 4-day program is $300 and we do work hard to offer scholarships to women unable to afford the fee. The dates are March 2 - 5 and September 28 - October 1, 2009.  They're held at a spa called Sundara Inn and Spa in Wisconsin Dells, WI.  You could look up the spa online to see photos - it's a very nice place!  If you're interested, please contact our office soon to register.  Space is limited at each retreat to 10 attendees. I will try to check back on this thread if you have any questions, but I encourage you also to check out our website or call us directly.  I don't want to intrude in your discussions any more...  Thanks!
