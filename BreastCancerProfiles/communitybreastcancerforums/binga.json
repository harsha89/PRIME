I am 38 and had to have both breasts removed in January and it is the hardest thing I have ever done and I don't have children (don't plan to) and am not married.  And you are absolutely right that if you were to need the surgery a man who doesn't support you shouldn't be with you.  However, for your own sake it really shouldn't be entered into lightly because it changes you in ways that are hard to understand until you have experienced it.  It can cause pain that lasts for a long time (possibly for the rest of your life).  I hope you get the help you need and really pray that everything turns out well for you.  Sorry if you felt like you were being treated like a child- you're not.  You are a young lady who like the rest of us have found yourself in a situation where you are frightened and need to know how to take care of yourself.   Becky ",
