So far so good, am feeling tired but otherwise okay. I had the neulasta shot yesterday and am hoping to not have all the pain I see appears to come with the territory. I have a PICC line in (double lumen) as I just spent a week in hospital getting 3 strong antibiotics 2-3 times daily and I have pretty crappy veins to begin with. So far the lumens have blocked 3 times needing the \"draino\" to fix them and I was ready for them to take the thing out, but the thought of all those needle sticks again convinced me to keep going with it. When they changed the dressing yesterday they put some heparin in the tubes, we'll see if that helps keep them open longer. Anyway, just wanted to say hi, must go to bed now as I have been saying that for the past 3 hrs and it is now 12.45am. So goodnight for now",

I am trying not to fret too much about it, especially as my breast is still red and warm from surgery a month ago, so I may end up having to postpone. I will do a \"walk-in\" appt with my onco doc on Tuesday and see what she says. Part of me wants her to say postpone and the other part wants to get going and stop the waiting. I haven't read anything too very scary on here so that makes me a little more optimistic about the S.E. We have a really good support system here and are given free wigs, so although I have one I a not sure if I will have the courage to wear it or not. I have not changed my hairstyle in 35yrs, so you can see I don't do well with change. I got a real hair wig in a colour closer to what I was in my younger days, but as well as not changing my style I have also never changed my coulour. (I am a red head so that does inhibit too much change)",

I had a culture done of the breast fluid and it came back clean but the onco doc was not happy to see my breast still so red and warm so she called my surgeon (stand-in as my doc was off) and suggested they put me in the hospital for some IV vancomycin. I went in Weds pm and came out Thurs night. They gave me 3 I.V's and then sent me home with the oral equivalent. I am sure they just needed the bed as the doc had originally told me I'd be there till Firday and if it was then showing improvement he would consider sending me home with the pill. As it was they booted me out after the 3 treatments (no obvious change) and before I had even finished getting my stuff together they were stripping and cleaning my bed. Plus, during the 1.5hr infusion the nurse kept asking me if my ride was on their way.....way to feel taken care of :):) So, I wish all of you the best with your chemo.and will join a new group when I start. I am sure I will chat with you all in other chat rooms.",
