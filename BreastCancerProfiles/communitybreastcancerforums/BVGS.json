Didn't think a lot about it. then on 5/6 it happened again, but this time wave after wave. My oncologist sent me for an MRI, but I was too sick to go into the machine. They did a CT and a few days later MRI - both negative. Then sent me for a cardio clearance before surgery. After all that my family doctor said I have benign paroxymal positional vertigo and put me on meds for that.  But I was curious if it is a delayed side effect of chemo. Is there any proven link and where can I find more information? Log in to post a reply",
