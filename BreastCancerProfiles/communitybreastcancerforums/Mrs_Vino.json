I feel the same way; the only pink thing I've bought since my diagnosis is actually a brown tshirt that says \"yes they're fake, the real ones nearly killed me!\" I figured why not? I mean, being bald is a pretty big indicator in itself, might as well wear that tshirt. Also, I love fleur de lis', so this year my brother, a graphic artist, designed a wine label for the state fair here in Ky in my honor. My husband makes homemade wine. Anyway, it is a gold fleur de lis with a pink ribbon draped around it, and has very cool background with positive words, when I saw it I thought, ok, that I like! But I draw the line there, lol! It won first place, btw!",

I was told I had 2-3 weeks before it would start to come out, and planned on shaving it when it did. So I thought us getting home from the lake (day) 15 would be a safe bet. Well, it started coming out by handfuls on day 13, Saturday night. The next day we went out in the boat, and it was flying back on everyone. I started floating on a raft, and as I would run my hands through it, it just kept coming out. I knew we weren't leaving until the next day, and I was so obsessed with my hair, I couldn't enjoy myself. I think the hardest part for me was thinking it was going to go a certain way, and it didn't. Just another thing with this disease you have no control over. Anyway, after a few adult beverages, we went to a friends houseboat, and I sat in a chair surrounded by several amazing friends who took turns cutting, trimming, shaving, and designing until it was all gone. Then we realized nobody on the damn lake had a bandana! So I tied a tank top around my head, and that was that. Once it was gone, I was fine! The thing is, talking to others and asking questions is wonderful. This site has been a true blessing for me! However, realize that your story is your own. Just because it happened a certain way to any number of people, doesn't mean you will have exactly the same experience. That's what has been the hardest for me to learn through all of this awful ride ( not saying journey, because taking a journey should be fun!) with cancer, making plans are almost impossible, there are no exacts, there's wait and sees filled with hope :-). That being said, I will tell you that when. I came home from the lake, I don't know why I was so shocked to go to the bathroom and find my underpants full of pubic hair!! Lol. And unfortunately my leg hair still had to be shaved about once a week, go figure! You will have to update us all on your hairless story. I finished my chemo six weeks ago this past Monday. My hair is starting to fill back in, slowly. I'm over the whole scarf thing! Lol. Never lost all of my eyelashes or brows, just about half, and the brows that I noticed growing back this am are the ones I used to tweeze! Figures...",

Next is surgery to remove TE and port, replace with implants, and hysterectomy. Had to cancel last week and wait to reschedule due to low blood count. It amazes me how long it takes your body to recoup after chemo! Everybody thinks you're done, so you should feel better. I wish! They said the back pain could last months, even longer with tamoxifen. Just ready for this WBC to come up so I can move forward. As for normal? That's now just a cycle on my dryer. Best of luck with your chemo, you will do fine. My two favorite scarves I purchased from Brighton this year. They are in the fashionista line. Very cool, have lots of color, go with just about everything! Check them out.",

I had to have that shot every time. Can't believe they're not checking you!! I can't say enough about the care I got, but have found out so much on this site!! My SE were minimal after my first treatment too, but that changed. You should definitely be monitored!",
