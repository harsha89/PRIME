I have educated myself and know what I am dealing with.  My last MRI in April 2011 showed that this mass \"persists\", but my surgeon told me that I have a normal MRI ???  Second opinion doctor concurs with radioligist that there is another mass but since 1st mass removed was benign that my fears should not get the best of me.  I understand this as well.  He also recommended that I get a follow up ultrasound but my current surgeon put me back on schedule for a 6 month follow up mammogram, which I am due to have in approx 2-3 weeks.  A little history background.  Mom had cancer removed 33 years ago.  She had full mastectomy and has been cancer free since (great insperation).  Father's sister died of breast cancer.  I have had 4 mammos and 2 MRI in the past 2 years, not counting the MRI and mammogram done on the day of surgery. I also had needle biopsy on other breat which is a fibroadenoma but doctor will not take out. Not concerned about that but it does sit on a nerve and gives me some awful pain from time to time. I am very diligent on these screenings since my doctor feels I am in a higher risks factor.  Since I will be seeing my surgeon after the mammogram I will have some questions and my last MRI in hand. Should I insist to have this new mass of cells taken out? Ultarasound sounds useless since could not see it first time. Do I wait another year for the next MRI? These mammos every 6 months only show all the cysts and not these particular cells.  Any suggestions?  I am quite educated on the conditions of my breasts.

I stopped taking mine and gradually felt better. I have high cholesterol but fish oil is a great substitute for the meds. One last thing. I have researched this disease for many years. I have not come to any conclusion yet as to how people are inflicted with this, but have read many articles of research and some believe that this is a chemical imbalance in the brain caused by a severe emotional trauma. Of course a diagnosis of cancer is truly a shocking discovery and the years of emotional termoil that follow. Mine was the untimely death of my brother.  And then when I learned of my cancer the fibro symptoms kicked into high gear so there my be some truth as to the emotional stress syndrome.  Your mind has a unbelieveable healing power.  Sometimes thinking good thoughts can give comfort.  It's hard when you feel so bad.  My favorite saying is \"mind of matter\".  I wish the best for you an hope for pain free days for you and everyone.",
