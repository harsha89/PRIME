I too was athletic and great balance, highly educated, articulate, independent person. ER+ and HER2+++ diag Sept 2013 first chemo Dec 2013 resulted in loss of balance, now nov 2017 and not back, just had to adjust life to be safer. By chemo 3 lost ability to speak and by 4-6 lost memory, ability to read write. I am relearning so much. Sadly the ONO's still say unrelated to chemo, but every other doc I encounter like neurologists, dentists, nurses all guess I had chemo before I even tell them. At this juncture I believe onocologists greatly lack knowledge of the toxic impacts and their arrogance to avoid it. The amount of money and loss of lifestyle to relearn things or live without job, or hire to do easy things I used to do is costly, replacing teeth, hair, hiring tutors, hiring PT to help me is all out of pocket because the ONO's say unrelated to chemo. Grrrr, ran 5 k a month before chemo, loss of balance immediately after chemo, each symptom added after each chemo. Sadly lost intellegience too, so I was too far gone to think to change doctors before the 7th chemo, luckly family pushed change and new ono immediately dialed down the dose and many things got better but damage was perm, but could have been worse if not changed doc's for 7-18 treatments. I'm convinced after this many years that onocologists are the least knowledgeable of chemo compared to soooooo many other doctor types and nurses. YOU HAVE TO BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE WITH ONOCOLOGISTS, if you already got damaged that ability may have gotten fried like mine, SO ALWAYS BRING AN ADVOCATE WITH YOU TO EVERY APPOINTMENT and treatment. The brain can become whimpy and needs an advocate to protect you. I used to be mover and shaker, very intelligent, high achiever, articulate with both oral and written. Now I have to use tools and guesses to communicate, home bound until I figure out solutions to balance issues, and family has limited to activities I'm allowed to do alone because of stupid brain farts like leave burners. oven, water on, or wash something still plugged in that should not be washed anyway. I went from a multi-tasking, high functioning, wife/mother/caregiver to instead a person in the house that barely get things done in one day or week or month that used to just take less than an hour. IF YOU AT THIS POST - GET A SECOND OPINION RIGHT AWAY - NEGOCIATE A LOWER DOSE - MAKE SURE THEY ARE SUBTRACTING AT LEAST 3 POUNDS OF Weight for clothes, etc. Onocology will say that a few pounds does not matter - NOT TRUE AND I AM PROOF. Sure maybe 3 pounds does not affect a person's doseage if they are 130 pounds or more, but if your a 100 pound person and a dose for three more pounds just DOES make a difference. Plus they would not test me for metabolism of medication that the World Health Organization is trying to mandate be done by all onocologists before the first chemo. There are genetics involved in metabolism of things, and a simple test timing between some type of sugar and when it appears in urine could have saved my brain, my body, my family, and my job.",

On name brand I am achy and uncomfortable, on generic I end up in wheelchair and tons of pain meds. I had to chose quality vs quantity life and stopped drug and felt great. Doc and company gave me access to name brand for 6 months at generic cost rate and life was doable without pain meds and confusion and dizzy small. Now 6 days back on generic and close to wheelchair and writing this because we know soon will be unable to read/write fingers and be confused and loose time again. There is a difference, but cannot get access to name brand affordably. To those told no difference and you think there is, you are not crazy. To researchers out there that say issues are related to menopause and not the drug, stuff it, off the drugs no pain or other issues, on the drugs I feel and act 200 years old. It should be a crime to prevent affordable access to name brand drugs. And yes, it was a blind test as to which I was given, and yes, my body 100% could tell you within short timeframe it was generic.",
