I had a partial mastectomy, 6 weeks radiation, 6 months chemo and then 5 years tamoxifen. I really thought That i had done everything possible and that the cancer after all this time was behind me. I was gutted when they found a growth during ultrasound and that it was malignent. I had a mastectomy and imediate reconstuction 2 weeks ago. The histology results have come back showing there were 5 tumors 17mm, 13mm, 12mm , 11mm and a tiny 5mm. They were spread through out the breast. I'm gutted. I did everything possible and not only did the cancer come back but it came back bigger and better than before. Now we get to start the whole treatmentthingall over again. I was fine with the idea of one tumor but the idea that 5 had been growing away happily really freaks me out. Seeing the onc on friday to see what they want to do.Not looking forward to it at all.
