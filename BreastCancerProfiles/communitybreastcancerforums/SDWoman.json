      "Content": "Jan 19, 2019 05:10PM - edited Jan 19, 2019 05:11PM by SDWoman I had 3 biopsies last fall. 2 were stereostatic and 1 was ultrasound guided. I think stereostatic is used for very small areas (mine were calcifications) or areas that won't show on an ultrasound. The ultrasound one I had was for an actual lump. I had to lay on a table on my stomache with my right breast going through a hole in the table. I felt a bit like a cow! Sounds strange I know! But the nurses will make every effort to make you as comfortable as can be. They then raise the table to allow room for them to work. They then find the location via a mammogram and while under compression they do the biopsy after numbing the area. They also will leave a tiny titanium clip in to mark the spot where the tissue was removed. The clips are actually kind of cute and you can say you got some bling! I attached a picture that I took of the clips when I had mine done. It sounds worse than it is and is not hard to endure at all. Be sure to wear a compression bra that you can get a small slender ice pack in. You will get through this. Best advice is to keep busy in the days ahead to keep you distracted. 80% chance all will be ok. ",

Your diagnosis is almost identical to mine for size. As far as drains, my doctor said they needed to be under 20cc for multiple days before they could be removed. This seems to be the consensus online as well. I also was instructed no showers until drains were removed. As far as the bra, I was told to wear the surgical bra or similar compression bra 24/7 for 6 weeks. To me it was more comfortable to have it on anyway. You may want to consider adding the January surgeries forum to your favorites if you haven't already. I follow the December group and it has been a godsend hearing from others going through surgery the same time as you. Best of luck to you as you continue to heal. ",
