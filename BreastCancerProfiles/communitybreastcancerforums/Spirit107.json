My friend told me that if they stay there for longer then a week or two to talk to my mom but i cant really talk to her about anything let alone the thought of having BC! i know it very unlikely to get BC at my age but still i'm worried cause i've had them for quite a while now... is this something i should be worried about or is it normal to have bumps there?
