We have all had to deal with the waiting, and know how awful it is. The issues you have need to be addressed, and there is no doubt that you are feeling really stressed, we understand, and are happy to wait with you till you get answers. April will be here before we know it, so good luck till then, and let us know how you are doing! Meant to mention, I got a hard lump of scar tissue after my core biopsy too. It scared me too till i realised what it was.",

I hated that sucker, but at first, I didn't want any more surgery so I put up with it for over a year. Finally, I spoke with my surgeon about it, he wanted me to go to hospital and have another general anesthetic. He said it would be like doing another mini Mx. I told him I wasn't interested in having another general, could he please do it with a local anesthetic, the area around it was all numb anyway. He finally, reluctantly agreed and I had it done in his office. The first he's ever done that way. It wouldn't be for everyone, but for me, it was the best thing I could have done. We chatted through the whole procedure and he even took pictures for me. I think he enjoyed it. LOL If you can take looking at the pictures of the transition from Mx through to the removal of the Dog Ear, there are pictures on Erica's site breastfree.org, I am willing to bet, you will be surprised by the difference. For those who haven't experienced that annoyance, it probably doesn't look like much, but for us, it is such a relief. Now, after more time has elapsed, you can't really see where the scar is at all. You may even consider having the revision done during the other surgery. I just wanted to let you know that you don't have to put up with the discomfort, it is able to be fixed. We look forward to getting to know you too! There are lots of us who haven't reconstructed and there is a lot of information on boobs, foobs and prosthesis and bras and clothing with pockets too. Your link is very interesting, the bras are really pretty. I have never been to Canada, but many years ago I was working in the music business, at a booking agency and we were looking after a group from Canada who were touring here, called Guess Who. I remember one of the members was from Saskatchewen, he talked a lot about his home. Then in the 90's I worked for an American airline, here in Australia and we ground handled Air Canada, so I met lots and lots of lovely Canadians, some from Saskachewen too and there were a few things I could talk to them about that I learned from that contact so long ago. I wish you all the very best...let us know how you're doing. ",

LOL I am sure that mine started when I had my Stereotactic Core Biopsy, and then worsened when I had the Mx. There is so much controversy about Mondors, Lymph Cording, and Thrombosis. I have read everything I can find on it, but I think that due to the fact that it \"resolves itself\", no one bothers too much about it. Personally, I really didn't like having, what I equated to a nasty varicose vein, that branched off down my abdomen. It looked nasty, and when it was massaged it felt really yuck too. I don't believe that mine had any Lymph involvement either, but I did read that when some of these things have been biopsied, they can be either lymph or vein. It is also quite common, I believe, in women who have had breast augmentation, so that means that the description of it being caused by any kind of trauma to the breast. sounds spot on.  Good Luck with it Misha, I hope it resolves quickly for you.",

My Surgeon explained that it was just flesh that was always pulled forward by the weight of the breast and after the breast was gone it just sits under the arm. Mine felt like it had a bunch of cut nerves in it, so when I stretched my arm up and it slipped over the side of my bra, the sensation was a zinger. I had actually started to develop a habit of always feeling for it to make sure it was tucked in, yuck!  I couldn't be happier with the results of the revision. I had it done under a local anesthetic in my Surgeons office. Not really what he wanted to do, but I just didn't want another General Anesthetic. It is now a nice flat area without the zinging, quite numb, but so much better than it was. It has added about 7cm to the Mx scar, but it is so fine, it won't be too visible.  I have heard of these things being removed during reconstruction. Good luck with it!",

We all understand your feelings on the waiting game, it is universal, we all rate it as the worst part of the process. You really aren't going to know what is going on till all of the Biopsy is processed. When I had my biopsy I was told that there were calcifications found in many specimens, that it is very common. It is the presentation, or shape of the micro calcification that make it suspicious. Since there is only the finding of course microcalcs, you'll have to wait for some more information. It may make you feel better to know that the vast majority, approx 80%, of lumps and calcifications come up B9 in a Biopsy I know it is hard, but you'll know soon.    Come here often, and ask questions, there are many people here that will come to help and support you if you need it.

My situation was different, because I was Dx after a mammo, but I am sure there will be others along who may identify with your experience. In saying that, please try to keep in mind that not all breast issues result in a BC Dx. The vast majority of women get a B9 result. You are doing the right thing, by moving quickly to get this looked at by your Doctor. I totally understand why you are feeling so overwhelmed, we all say that this waiting, is the worst part. We as humans don't do fear of the unknown very well:) I wish you all the very best, please stay away from Google, it can scare you with lots of irrelevant information that is out of date.

I just wanted to jump in and say that the feeling you have in the underarm, and the Bingo Fat(I love that description) is exactly what you would expect fron removal of a lymph node.  They are nasty little devils when removed, and give a lot of us what I call \"The Claw\". It is a burning, grasping, numbness that can go right down your arm. Very unpleasant! As for the IBC, it is a rare one, I am not saying don't follow it up. I would definitely be pushing for the punch biopsies too. You are NOT a hypochondriac, don't let them make you feel bad about being your own advocate. We have to follow our intuition, lets just hope you are wrong, and it is a bad case of Mastitis, or indeed an infection from the previous procedure. I find if I am not getting what I want from Doctors, I ask them how they will feel if I am right and they missed it! It usually gets action. I sure hope this is resolved for you soon. I can imagine how terrible you are feeling, and I know the waiting is just brutal, we all know that feeling. ((((Hugs))))) to you, I hope you get answers soon, Let us know how you get on!",

I know how hard it is to stop stressing about it, but the reality is, stressing won't make any difference to the outcome, so try to take some big deep breaths and take care of yourself while you wait.  The waiting is torture, we've all been right where you are now.

I don't think there is anything untoward by them letting you know there may be more imaging. When I went back for my callback after a suspicious finding on a regular mammo, they said they would give me another mammo, if still unsure they would give me an ultrasound, then if still unsure a Fine Needle Aspiration, and finally if they were still not happy it would be a Core Biopsy. I had the mammo, and then straight to Core Biopsy. I was afraid that this jump to the Core Biopsy meant that it was really serious, but I was wrong, it was just that Core Biopsy was required for DCIS which is what they thought I had. I had a clip inserted too, they showed it to me on the screen, along with all the material they took during the Core Biopsy. The team I had were fantastic, talking me through every step. I didn't have any sedation nor did I feel any claustraphobia from the Core Biopsy. Try not to read too much into what is happening right now. After you have met with them and the results are in you will have a clear picture.   Everyone will tell you that the fear of the unknown, and the waiting is the worst part this journey.

I am a \"Uniboober\" as we are sometimes called, almost a year out from my surgery 19th December last year. I have researched and acquired just about every kind of Foob, Boob and Prosthesis there is! LOL You may need to consider that you could still have a drain or two in place a week after surgery. I wore a Genie Bra with a soft fiber filled \"foob\" with my drain discretely threaded through the armhole of my top and into a soft cotton shoulder bag. Not the perfect way you'd want to meet the relatives, but better than having the drain pinned to the inside of your clothes. This is the worst case scenario! If you don't have a drain to worry about you can wear a Genie bra or a camisole with a soft \"foob\" pinned inside. I bought camisoles and bras I could step into, so I didn't overextend my arm. I wouldn't think you could handle anything more structured than those knitted bras or camisoles so soon after the surgery. It is possible that you may feel uncomfortable with anything tight or fitted against your skin. I am not meaning to scare you, but your skin can feel hypersensitive because of the nerve regeneration. I always say that I was really surprised that this wasn't a painful surgery, but a surgery of weird sensations! The last thing you want is to be feeling fidgety because you've chosen something too thick, or stiff to wear. I wish you all the very best for the 18th, and hope you have a great time with your relatives! Take care!",

We have had so many people come here who have had a bad experience before the results are in, with strong feelings about how they were sure it was something serious, but when the results came in, it was benign. It happens a lot, because 80% of biopsies are B9. If by chance, you fall into the 20%, who are not B9, like the majority of us who are here on the Forum, there is a wealth of knowledge and support right here, for you.

The feeling of being punched in the sternum, that you are describing, was something I felt too, and a kind of sandpaper, sunburn which is caused by the regeneration of the nerves that have been cut. As time goes on, that will change to other zapping and zinging sensations. I guess you are also speaking of having a concave area, where the tissue was removed. Most of my discomfort came from the disturbance of the nodes under my arm. The iron bra and extreme tightness is what the girls with the TE's or immediate recon speak about. I did the exercises religiously 4x each day, even though I had cording too. It hurts to do it, but it will ensure you get your range of motion back quickly. I found doing the first lot of exercises for the day, under the hot shower worked for me. It is very early days for you and there is still lots of inflammation, deep bruising and swelling, you've been through a really brutal surgery! I gently massaged my chest with essential oils in a carrier oil base which helped a lot with that soreness in the sternum. I can't speak for the usefulness of the pain meds, I will do anything to avoid them and had none at all, for the entire process, because I registered discomfort and strange sensation, but not pain. Try to be kind to yourself, you're body is healing right now, but it will continue to change in both feeling and appearance.

I don't care what anyone says, I believe that even though we are knocked out, our body knows what is happening to it and that is why, like with all kinds of medical procedures, some people are affected more profoundly, than others. I was one who suffered extreme tiredness after my Umx. I don't do anesthesia well. I seriously, could drop off to sleep mid sentence in the early weeks, after surgery. That's very normal!

You have done all the right things by following up, and having the biopsy etc. Don't beat yourself up for not doing things in the past. You're doing everything right now. We all know the feeling of the \"Roller Coaster Ride\", the clickety clack to the top of the rise, and then that moment before the plunge, it is awful having to wait for results, or indeed waiting to observe another lump. The great thing is that there is every chance that this will turn out to be nothing too.  I know it will be difficult for you to wait and see. We will all stilll be here if you need support in that time. Thanks for the lovely words about us. All of us were in the state of terror because we had been called back after a mammo, or had felt a lump etc. Kind strangers came to our aid and calmed us down, talked us through the statistics and gave us support through the long days of waiting for biopsies and results. Then if we were dx with BC, they were still there to hold us up through the waiting again, for surgery and final pathology, and the next steps on the journey. That's why we stick around to pay it forward.   I wish you all the very best for another benign result.",

Firstly, yes, calcifications are common, keeping an eye on them is sensible. When it comes to the pain, I don't know about that, it certainly doesn't point to a BC Dx. The Dr can give an opinion on what he sees, but the only way to get a definitive answer is to do a biopsy. In saying that, the vast majority of these breast issues, do turn out to be benign, like 80% of them! Ty to keep busy till your biopsy, it is difficult and we as humans, just don't do fear of the unknown, very well. Do things that you enjoy, make sure you eat well and take care of yourself, the time will pass. Although this is a BC forum and the majority of us, have been Dx, we are the other 20%, I mentioned earlier. I can tell you that many, many women come here just like you and once they have their biopsies and get a benign result, they move on.

I haven't spoken to anyone who has the contact forms so I really appreciate you letting me know your opinion. Do you mind me asking how long you had to wait to be able to attach them? I was told that I had to wait at least 6 months for all the healing and attachment to the chest to be complete, and then only to wear it for short intervals. Is that correct?  I was told about the \"life\" of the stickyness, and I am prepared for that because, like you, I wouldn't wear it that way every day.  I think if they had had my size at the store on the day I went in for my fitting, I would have bought the contact and just used it with the cover as a normal form in a pocket bra, but since they didn't have one there and patience isn't one of my virtues, I bought the one they did have which was  the Natura. I am happy with it, wear it most days, and really don't notice it  is there most of the time. That's saying something because we are in Aussie Summer, and it gets really hot where I live. The bead form, and the other Prosthesis I ordered from the US haven't arrived yet, so I haven't had a chance to get into the water yet. Not surprising though, my surgery was at Christmas and I wanted to make sure everything was good and healed before getting into the water. I live on a lake fed by river and the sea so brackish/ salt water. So sorry to hear you had problems after your reconstruction. I totally agree with you about having more surgery, it isn't on my agenda if I can help it either.  Take care, and thanks for the information.",

My Mother had a Radical Mastectomy in '94, just four months after my Dad passed away. I was so used to seeing her scar, and hearing her humour about it that seeing myself like that wasn't as big an issue as it could be for some. When I got my Dx, one of the first things I said was that I wouldn't be reconstructing, so could I have the best scar possible. When I woke after surgery, my Surgeon was there to tell me he done \"The straightest scar, he'd checked it with a spirit level!\"LOL I was told, however, that the door wasn't closed, if I decided to do a reconstruction later it would be possible. I must admit I liked that, I don't like being told that I \"can't do\" something. My husband is a C5/6 Quadraplegic from a hang gliding accident 35 years ago. He has been a rock for me and has absolutely no issue with me being a \"Uniboober\". His reaction  to seeing me on day one was to say \"Oh Wow! that will heal beautifully!\" and \"You don't need two boobs to be gorgeous!\" The truth is he wouldn't have a problem if the other one had to go the way of the first, but I didn't feel the need to have a BMX when there wasn't a problem with the other breast. You've got so much to think about, it is so hard when huge decisions have to be made so quickly. I really feel for you! I am sure there are others here, closer to your age, who are single and have been faced with the same decision you're facing right now. I am sure they will come along and try to help you with their experiences. Please ask anything you wish, we are all willing to share our experiences. I wish you all the very best with whatever you choose for you, please stay around and let us know what you decide, and then how you are doing.",

I had a problem with the Amoena light that I bought. so returned it and got the Contact instead. Have you watched the video for the Contact on the Amoena website? The reason I went for this prosthesis, which I should have bought right from the start, is because it can be attached to the chest inside a normal bra. It can also have the sticky side covered and used inside a pocket Mx bra. The video on the website shows a woman, who has had a Umx and is very small, as you describe yourself. I can't use this prosthesis attached for a while yet because they say you have to wait till 6 months after surgery, but I have tried it on several times and really like it. I have a deep concave below my scar going under my arm, but this still sits well and atttaches into the dip. Inside a bra it falls just like the real one. I have been on the hunt for the \"perfect\" prosthesis, but have discovered that for me, there are several options that I need. I know it sounds very over the top to have the softees, the microbeads, the Contact, and the Basic Light Amoena, but to be able to match the other side in all circumstances, that is what it takes. It is really easy for me now, to dress exactly as I choose.  The reality is that I haven't spent a great deal of money on these items. Our Government reinburses $400.00 on single prosthesis, every two years. We're out of pocket for the difference, and when you consider most prosthesis here in Aus are approx $450.00, much more expensive than in the US, but I don't know about Greece where you are, it is a reasonable shortfall, but is recoverable from our private health insurance if we have it. I have insurance, so my Contact was paid in full. The others I have bought online, the everyday Basic light from ebay, and the microbeads from websites in the US. I discovered another interesting product last night called \"BustFree\"Mastectomy Prosthesis which I believe is a double up of two sizes of their standard BustFree Bra inserts. It was apparently invented here in Australia, I am not sure how well it would work for me, being Umx, but for you,it may be worth a look. At approx $40.00 for the pair, it is a mighty cheap option for you, and no weight whatsoever. If they work, they would be ideal for those who can't take the weight of a silicone prosthesis. Although I prefer the Mx bras, Amoena Mona, being my favourite, and a great cotton one that is Target's own brand is another great one, the beauty of these prosthesis is that they can be worn in a normal bra. In fact the non prosthesis advertising says that you don't even need  a bra, that these things can be held in place by a cami, vest, or a tight Tshirt.    I'd love to hear from anyone who has tried these, either for Umx or Bmx. Sorry to be so long winded, but just wanted to share what I have found.",

Hot tea in the nose is not nice, but the picture you paint of the drooping silicone foobs was priceless. Please don't be offended, I don't mean to make light of it, but you just have a way with your words that got me laughing. I bought an Amoena Natura Light, they advertise this as a very natural looking foob that conforms when you lie down. It is supposed to look really natural, but the truth is it is really \"perky\", and a tad too hard in comparison to the real one. It certainly doesn't droop a lot, just moves a little to look a bit more more natural. I also have another amoena that is a discontinued style which is a much better match to my existing breast. It has a very slight ski jump shape, but doesn't droop excessively, and is much more mooshy, and soft, more like an almost 60 year old breast feels. Sorry if that is TMI.   I have to ask, were they actually prosthesis that you bought? or enhancers that go on top of real breasts. I found myself in a site the other night that catered for cross dressers. They even have a recipe for making your own silicone foobs. Very interesting! I digress LOL Did you put them in a pocketed bra, or just in a normal bra? Were they ones that attached to your chest? If you are putting heavy silicone foobs in an Ahh bra, type bra, that may be your problem. They aren't made to go together. Can you give some more information? I'd love to help you work out what went wrong with these \"foobs\".",

I am sure you'd have similar over there, just be sure they are Pure Essential oils in a carrier like Sweet Almond or Wheatgerm oil. Unless the wound is really healed together, I would just massage around the area. I found this massage helped heaps with the weird sensations that I was feeling. I am so sorry to hear about all the cancer that you've had in your family. I moved to Australia with my parents from Scotland when I was 5 and am an only child, so I had little to do with any other family members, other than my Mum and Dad. I don't know much about medical history of the family. Cancer is a terrible thing and becoming far too prevalent. My Mother had BC, but my Dad never had any cancer. I looked after my Mother for years, till Dementia made it impossible for her to remain at home.   I hope you can find a balance with the exercise that helps, but doesn't hurt too much. Range of motion is important, but too much pain is counterproductive. If you have access to a Physio therapist, it may be the way to go, just to make sure what you're doing is going to improve your movement. Don't worry about making me miserable, we are all here for each other and it's good to unload when we have things happening that worry us. I hope you have a good day, glad I could help a little!

This subject has been discussed here quite a lot. It seems to happen early on after the surgery, and generally starts to dissipate and finally disappears within the first year or so. I call this Mx surgery, the surgery of strange sensations. Another one that I named \"The Claw\" seems to be common too. It is the sensation of a large sharp claw holding the front of the chest and underarm. It usually hits when you've overdone it, manifesting at the end of the day. Between these sensations and the raspy sunburned feeling from the regenerating nerves, the numbness, and the phantom itching, it's all pretty weird. I am almost a year out from my Mx, and most of these strange feelings are gone now. I am still numb, but have gotten used to it. As time goes by, things just start to become \"The New Normal\".",

It's weird, but watching someone with the kind of daily struggle that he has, but he never complains about, makes my perspective on my own things, a bit different to the way they were, before he entered my life. He has been an excellent leveler for me.  He never fails to amaze me with his positivity. He has been my rock. My surgeon explained to me that they don't want to draw everything too tight when they close because it can effect your range of motion, an that it will get better with time. It is also affected by weight loss and gain. My \"Dog Ear\" has improved incredibly over the past 12 months, but there is just a little section at the very end that troubles me. It isn't a vanity thing,  it really bugs me, as yours does, when it is being rubbed by the side of my bra. It is kind of numb, but has some nerve, electric zaps, going on too. My surgeon was very open to repairing it, when I last saw him in September, but I wasn't keen on having more surgery, well actually not the surgery, but the anesthetic, is what I want to avoid. I decided to see how much it would bother me during the Summer, when I would be wearing sleeveless tops etc. It's early in our Summer but I have decided that I just want the very end, which has a slightly pointed protrusion, to be removed. I am sure that this will be able to be done with a local anesthetic and a few stitches, or even glue. That will still leave me with a slight fold, but I am loathe to remove it all because I don't want to risk any range of movement. I see my surgeon again at the end of January, so I'll arrange it at that meeting, and I'll let you know what transpires.  I am so interested to hear about Blanch, we have large flocks of these Sulphur Crested Cockies, as we call them all around us. They are the noisy birds of the area, there squauking is like nothing else around here, but they are beautiful to see. They fill some of the big trees when I go walking. It is an amazing sight for a city girl! We also have the Black Cockies over on the Island too. Our main draw card here is the huge population of Pelicans. I can get up some mornings and there can be 60 or more right outside on the water. The main domestic bird that you see here is the Pink and Grey Galah. They are pretty loud too, but learn to speak and dance and do tricks. My ex had one at his Mother's house. She would go out to call the cat and the dog, who were Frank and Zappa, in for dinner, then for the rest of the evening Gus, the bird would be shouting Frank Zappa! I guess you had to be there! LOL They live to a very old age, and I have heard of these birds being passed down the family. Sorry to have hijacked this thread a bit, but I will let you know about the \"Dog Ear\"",

I started to massage around my scar right after my Umx and continued it over the incision line once it was healed. I went to a massage therapist every 2 weeks, who did myofascial release. I did use aromatherapy oils in carrier oils, to massage my chest, but this was an analgesic blend that I have used for many years, for the pain of Rheumatoid arthritis and to help with the scarring I have, from several Rheumatoid surgeries. I swear by it and it does keep the skin really soft and supple. My concern was mostly about not getting good range of motion back in my shoulder, post surgery, because of the arthritis, but the massage and the stretching exercises prevented that and I had a fairly quick return, to full range of motion. The cording was tight, but it did resolve on its own, with the help of the massage. One of the cords did snap when I rolled over in bed one night! I also found I got great results from using silicone strips on my incision line. My surgeon had introduced me to them for my previous surgeries, to take the redness out and to flatten my scars. I bought a 22\" Silicone FX strip, cut it in 2 and I had the 2 to use, for several months along my Umx scar and then I used one again, for the 7cm extension to my Umx scar, when I had my Dog Ear removed, over a year after the Umx surgery. These strips are used for burns and cosmetic surgeries. They may not work for everyone, but for me they were fantastic. I am almost 2 years out now and the scars are really fine and silver and my chest is supple, so for me, it was definitely worth all the effort and commitment. Good luck with it! ",

I just did a search on \"Weird sensation when drinking hot or cold beverages\" I found my first entry on Jan 14th this year, but there may be specific thread for it further back. I mentioned it in the Australian Sisters, and New and Future Flat Sisters, and some of the other non reconstruction threads. I am sure it is mentioned even further back because it is such a common sensation. Although I asked my Surgeon what causes it, he didn't have an answer. As far as I know, no one else has come up with an answer for it either, other than it is self limiting, like so many other weird things that go with this kind of surgery. I believe it is to do with the removal of the \"insulation\", or perhaps just hyperactivity of the nerves in that area. I haven't heard of anyone, who still has it after the first year or so, and I have to say that it lessens over time, so that it isn't a bother at all. I can only feel it slightly these days if I concentrate on it while drinking something very hot or cold. I hope this helps!

I have heard women here talking about the flesh left at the center of their chest. I have a very long incision, It goes from about, 1cm across onto my other breast and then curves around under my arm toward my back, it is around 11cm long, my surgeon did some magic for me and removed some sun damaged, loose skin from my chest, during the surgery. My surgeon explained my \"Dog Ear\" to me, as flesh that was always there, but the weight of the breast, in my case, 975gms \"D\" cup, pulled it forward and flattened it out. He said it is all part of the skin that lets you stretch up and forward. I can see where it is, and how it works, on the good side. I had a Seroma and a Hematoma which caused a lot of swelling and a \"wave\" effect, but  after they were drained it all settled down quite well. I am so sorry you have LE, I hope it settles down and doesn't give you too much trouble. I'd love to give those nurses and PA's a short sharp slap for their insensitive and uneducated comments about \"Getting used to your \"New Normal\".

There are a lot of very expensive forms on the market, but there are ways to get the best products, for minimal costs. I am assuming you don't have insurance that will offset the cost of real forms and bras? I have heard that in the US many of the insurance companies cover a lot of items. Quite different to where I am, I buy most of my Mx items from the US. I would advise you, to at least go to a fitter and be fitted for a proper Mx bra or 2 and a few different forms, You can then shop online, at sales and on Ebay for the items that suit you, at hugely reduced prices. It isn't unusual to be able to pick up both new bras and often forms for around $20.00 on Ebay. It also depends on the size that you are, as to what kind of mock ups you will be comfortable with. If you are a very small size, you can get away with the Ahh Bras and Camisoles with department store enhancers, or even by packing some soft wadding in behind the modesty pads that come in those items. Vintage Girl, one of our members has discovered some really nice bras that can be converted that way. If you are a larger size, then I would recommend you actually try a real form, there are weighted foam forms, as well as basic silicone forms. The Mx bras are cut completely differently to a regular bra. They have a different underarm, in case of discomfort after node removal and they have a different cut to the straps which prevents them from ever falling down your shoulders.  There isn't much I haven't tried since my Mx in 2012, but although they can be expensive, I have found properly designed Mx products, fitted properly, are worth at least, some investment.  Properly taken care of, these items last and last. Take a look at Erica's site breastfree.org, she has a wealth of information on forms and clothing. There is also a closing down sale at womenspersonalhealth.com right now with great reductions on lots of high end items, but you would need to be sure of sizing first. I wish you all the very best!   ",

I was also involved in a trial over the Summer, for a new Amoena Prosthesis which had the clear silicone back to regulate the heat. it worked quite well. Although I wear a silicone prosthesis, I have the Amoena Energy, Classic and a Contact if I am dressed to go anywhere, but I am finding I am leaning toward the weighted foam foobs most of the time, during the day.  I really like the weighted Tru Life. I wear it in a cotton and elastane sports bra, or the Amoena Valletta Camisole. I don't have a problem with excessive perspiration, as such, but I do try to have a cotton or wicking fabric next to my skin so I feel dry. I wear a size 8, and have a D cup on the other side. I always dust across my chest with Cornflour. I have been using cornflour as an antiperspirant since my Mx.",

I don't know what the form was that I trialed for Amoena, they just ask you to wear it and to answer the sheets of questions after the trial is over. It was very similar to the Comfort that I have, but I don't know what changes had been made to it. I don't have the access to all these brands you speak of. I have bought most of my collection from the US, your prices are much more reasonable than ours, and although I would like to spend locally, to keep my money in my region, it is just not possible, with the huge differences in price. I have made a few mistakes in sizing, but considering what I have saved it hasn't been too bad.  Thanks for all your input and for Breastfree, it is a very valuable resource. I will have those pics to you soon. M x",

I should say that these forms are actually suggested for leisure wear, as they are a bit more fragile than the silicone forms. I have had a little bit of damage along the edges of mine from putting it in and out of the bra. Metromedicalonline has the best price I could find, and they do a better price if you buy 2. Here  in Australia they are $88.00 each and I got mine from the US for 2 for $72.00. One of our members here, Erica, has a great website called breastfree.org where she has done a lot of research into different forms, you may find some more info there about other types. Good luck!",

I had to admit that I had been obsessing over it, but she assured me, I could have searched all I wanted, but there was no lump, for me to find. Please keep in mind that the vast majority of all breast issues, turn out to be benign. The waiting is definitely the worst, we all agree about that.

It is possible to have swollen lymph nodes, because a bad flare of RA will lay you low with inflammation all over and will affect everything. I know it is hard but try not to stress about every little thing. We don't do fear of the unknown very well, but the truth is, the vast majority of people who come here terrified that they have BC, in fact don't have anything sinister at all. I hope that's the case for you too! Try to take it a step at a time, you know that getting stressed with give your Arthritis a boost and it will flare up and make you miserable.  I wish you all the very best for a B9 result, let us know how you get on.",

I had a \"dog ear\" which is the term used for these pouchy bits that are left after Mx surgery. My surgeon explained it to me as flesh that used to be pulled forward by the weight of the breast and really just presents where they finish the incision. I hated mine and the fact that it had what felt like a buzzing bunch of cut nerves inside it, made it something I wanted rid of. I waited just over 12 months before having mine excised and it was the best thing I ever did. I waited, because I really wanted to see how much it would change over time  and if I became more used to it. When I realized that I was  always going to be feeling for it, because it would come over the side of my bra, and I was constantly annoyed by it, it wasn't a hard decision. There is a before and after set of pictures on Breastfree.org. Take a look and see if this is the same thing you have. You'll see that the after picture shows nothing but a fine scar and taught flat skin. I wish you all the best and feel free to PM me, or ask anything here, if I can help with any queries about this surgery. ",

I had a seroma and a hematoma and a small infection. I also discovered a weird ropey, lumpy thing coming from where my nipple had been. It snaked down my abdomen and branched off like a tree. There was another one that was under my rib cage. It is called Mondors Disease, and although not hugely common it happens after any kind of trauma to the breast and is very much like a Varicose vein. This isn't the same as a DVT which is a blood clot and can be very dangerous. They have other names for this too Phlebitis, Thrombosis. These cords are related to the lymph cording that many women get under their arm after surgery. Mine was a burning, pulling, discomfort, especially when I did the PT stretching exercises. In fact one of mine did pop when I turned over in bed one night. Mondors Cording not dangerous and is self limiting, which means it actually just goes away on its  own. Massage and heat can help to break it up. I massaged it myself and used heat packs, I also had it massaged by a therapist, who also massaged my chest to help avoid adhesions. Mine was gone by the 3 month mark after surgery.   It is definitely something that needs to be checked out. I was very surprised by the lack of information about it, but it seems to be more common in women who have breast augmentation.  I wish you all the very best, and hope that this turns out to be something that resolves quickly!",

I am sorry though that you're still experiencing the pain and I am so sorry to hear of your loss. I don't know how I would have fared without my Husband for support. Do you massage the chest and underarm at all? I get great relief from massage with oils and Essential Oils that act as analgesics. If you can see a PT, you may find you can get great relief from just a couple of visits. They can work wonders for this post surgery stiffness and cording. I must say, I was told only to exercise where it felt comfortable, not to push it too soon and not to overdo if I felt any pain. I had cording, even had one of them snap when I rolled over in bed one night. I had PT massage for that too and it worked very well for me. Don't beat yourself up over the SNB. As it turned out, I didn't need mine either, but for me, I would do the SNB again in a heartbeat, to be sure that I didn't have to have an Axillary Clearance if any invasion had been found, in my final pathology. It happens so much, even when totally unexpected. I know it can feel like a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation. I just look at it as the best of a gamble, I had to take. My Mother had an Axillary Clearance in the days before SNB, it turned out she had no invasion, but she had problems with LE for the rest of her life, I often wonder how different her remaining years would have been had she had been able to have a SNB and not that full clearance. I wish you well Alfieval, I would like to know how you get on. As difficult as it is, try to take it a little easier on yourself, you have been though an awful lot and just need some time to heal and feel better.",

LOL I have been caught up for the past few week with finishing the renovations to our house that I stopped when I was Dx. We'd only been here for 4 months when I found out. We had had many months of work done before we moved into the house and then the tradesmen were still around for months after we moved in, so I had just had enough and asked them to leave and I would call them back when I was over the surgery etc, well here we are almost 2 years down the track and it has taken ages to be able to assemble them all again to make the final push to finish. It will all be done by the week after next. I can't wait till I can put everything back and get rid of the stuff we no longer need.   I hope you have a wonderful visit, I envy you your Grandchildren, I doubt I will ever be a Grandma, my Daughter doesn't want children and is on her own, after a breakup with her boyfriend a couple of years ago.

Just keep in mind that the only way to get a definitive answer as to what is going on in your breast is by having a biopsy and receiving a pathology report.  The majority of breast issues turn out to be benign, so don't give up hope, you could also be one of those. If it tuns out that you are Dx, there are many surgical and treatment options available. Try to just take it a step at a time, I know how scary it is, we all do.

I would urge you not to get too involved in the post surgery pain syndrome, yet. There will be much healing and still a lot of nerve regeneration which will go on for some time. If you have got a fluid build up from early removal of your drain, you may well have a seroma. Don't worry too much about that either, it is very common. I had one that looked like the wave of a waterbed across my chest, which I had drained once and then left to reabsorb by my body. It took some time, but resolved by itself.  The other thing that I didn't mention in the previous post was exercises and massage. I know that PT exercises aren't pushed in the US like they are here, in Australia, but I did the stretching exercises given to me by my PT before I left the Hospital, 4 x a day religiously, to prevent adhesions. I also massaged my chest a couple of times every day, after the steri strips and dressing were removed, with essential oils in a carrier oil, to help with the soreness and to keep my skin supple. I don't know if you had a SNB, but that was the most uncomfortable part for me, with numbness and soreness down the inside of my arm. Again, I used massage every day to get that back, to feeling somewhat \"normal\". I also go to a massage therapist regularly and she has done Myofascial  release massage on my chest too. I am not suggesting that you should do this, but I was so surprised at the strange sensations that I was experiencing, after my surgery, that I watched a Mx surgery on the internet. It is a truly brutal surgery, so although I have to say, pain wasn't the issue for me, I can understand how disrupted everything is after this surgery. The nerve regeneration, which goes on for some time is likely what you're experiencing, but for most, it becomes tolerable and then dissipates over time. I hope your pain subsides soon, as I said before, your Doctors are the best ones to advise you, but I hope some of this info may assist you too!",

The blend I use is made by an Aromatherapist here in Aus. It has a long list of ingredients and several carrier oils. I just took a look on iHerb and they have a good range of massage oils, even one that is called breast massage oil. I don't know which oils are safe to use, after surgery. I did ask my surgeon if I could use my oils even though there is some Lavender in mine, which  I know a lot of women avoid now, he had no problem with them. Maybe if you start with just some warm coconut oil or another plant oil, it is the massage that really helps with the stiffness and the pain and for me, the essential oils help with the inflammation.  I had my fitting at 6 weeks post surgery when most of the swelling had gone down and the incision was healed.

Everyone here understands how you're feeling, we all felt that fear and the anxiety of waiting for results.  The one thing that you need to keep in mind is that the odds are actually in your favor for a B9 result. More than 80% of these breast issues are B9. The length of time that it takes to get results varies, and depends on how busy the lab is, if there is a weekend or a public holiday. Some Doctors won't give results over the phone, so an appointment has to made etc. I know it feels like everything is just taking forever. I had a public holiday fall on the day I should have received my results so it pushed my appointment back another week, so I had to wait 11 looooong days! That's so not the norm! LOL The only advice I can give you is to try to do things you enjoy, while you wait. The one thing that I learned is that the worrying will not change the outcome, but it can make you sick.  Take care, come here if you have questions, there will usually be someone around who can help. Try to stay off Dr Google, he is a lousy diagnostician, who can scare you with lots of irrelevant, or out of date information.

We are all different, have different pain tolerance and even the same type of surgery affects some of us differently. I didn't experience pain at all, and didn't take any pain medication at all, but I did have lots of strange sensation which ranged from a burning, sandpaper or severe sunburn sensation and zingers from regenerating nerves and numbness and pins and needles from the SNB. Those who have reconstruction and tissue expanders speak of considerable pain and tightness. You don't mention if you reconstructed. As WarriorWoman, said, if you are concerned and experiencing pain that feels like it is more than it should be, your Surgeon would be the best person to talk to. If it were me, I would take over the counter pain medication 4 or 6 hourly for a couple of days to see if that makes a difference to the way it feels. I'd make sure there wasn't any redness or that I wasn't running a temperature and if still not feeling right, I'd call and speak to the surgeon.  I wish you all the best for a speedy recovery!

I kind of went the other way and kept running on adrenaline for a while. I have never been one to cry, but I found I could be set off by a sad TV commercial, even now, but I didn't feel sad, if that makes any sense. I was the queen of the incision massage! LOL I still do it every day. It took a while for the swelling to go down and I had the Seroma too, that lasted months. I also had the pouchy thing, which is called a Dog Ear, I had that removed more than a year later. It is a long process Val, but it does get better. I don't know how I would have fared in the early days after the surgery, if I was on my own. Do you have anyone close, to spend time with when you feel a bit teary? We have been through a big, life changing event, with much fear and brutal surgery, anesthesia that takes a long time to completely leave us, so don't expect to feel 100% early on. I was pretty happy with my scar, once it had healed and the swelling dissipated, and finally when the dog ear was gone. I have one section of the scar where it opened up and I had an infection which has ruined the nice fine line I had hoped for, but all in all, I can ignore that and just deal with it as it is. It isn't unusual to have a revision to get the chest flat, I have read of women having revisions after it has all settled down. It is still very early days , it was June wasn't it, for you? Try to take it one step at a time. I am coming up for 20 months, which I can't believe, but I had to realize it was a process and let it run its course. You will be fine, you've been through a lot. Keep in touch, I look forward to hearing from you!   ",

I have been involved in every one of these threads, on this subject, since I started coming here almost 2 years ago. My Surgeon was trained and worked in South Africa where he started breast clinics all over he country, he did the same in England and then came to the region where I live in Australia. He has been doing  breast and Mx surgeries for many years and was really surprised that I was stressed and worried about having this SNB done. I told him about the stories I had heard, about this horrific pain and he told me he had never had a patient tell him, they'd had a bad experience having it done. What the!!!!, How can that be! I just don't get it! I certainly don't doubt the word of anyone who has had this test and felt extreme pain. I guess there must be some relevance to pain threshold, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis, so  I am used to extreme pain, but I really felt nothing, when I had my SNB. I went into it tense and afraid, which I would have thought, would just exacerbate pain. I had 4 shots, all in the areola, just like the others, who had such a bad experience. I remember reading somewhere that there are solutions which have different PH levels, which may be something to consider. My tech was very good, he did talk me through the whole procedure, he had a lovely personality and did everything to make me feel comfortable and relaxed. One thing, I must say though, I don't agree with some of the really over the top, extreme descriptions, of this procedure, which I have seen in the past, on these boards. These do nothing, but strike fear into the hearts of newbies who may be facing the procedure and have come here for support.  I really do wish this procedure could be painless for everyone.",

I really wasn't terribly afraid of the Mx, but the accounts and descriptions, by some people I spoke to and read posts by, about the unbearable, extreme, intractable pain of this procedure, really rattled me. I don't believe in sugar coating it, this procedure is not the same for everyone, but striking such terrible fear into the hearts of women who are already afraid and about to have this procedure done, along with other life changing surgery, is just plain wrong and unnecessary. I am very pleased to be able to say, for me, it was as painless as anything could be.

You have a history with this breast isssue, and you are doing everything right. Having the Biopsy is the right thing to do, and the only way to find out what is going on. Three weeks is a long time to wait for results, but we all understand how awful the waiting is, we've all done it. Try to keep yourself busy, and stay away from Google, Come here when you need to, we all know what you're going through. The vast majority of these breast issues turn out to be benign, so try not to go there in your mind. Easier said than done, I know. When it comes to your pain in the hip and the night sweats, there is nothing to say that any of this is related. I personally had night sweats, on and off from when I was 38 and started to go through early menopause, it was all over by the time I was 43. I have arthritis too, and it is always at its worst at night, so it is quite possible you could have similar to me. None of this was in any way related, and I will be 60 next birthday, my diagnosis was in November last year, a very long time after these episodes. I am not suggesting that you're going through early menopause or that you have arthritis, just that there are so many things that it \"could\" be. Try to be kind to yourself and do things you enjoy while you are waiting. Come here, and let us know how you are doing! ((((((((hugs))))))))",

That's what is so great about this site, everyone is always looking out for each other!  Congratulations! One week out and your are \"Foob\"  hunting. I was just the same and so were many others here.In fact, I turned up at the lingerie shop in the next big town from the small one I live in one week after my surgery. The ladies were very kind, asked me if I was having a Mx, but when I said I'd had it a week earlier they just shooed me away and said they couldn't fit me for at least 6 weeks. I was back 6 weeks to the day for my fitting and really haven't looked back. I am the same size as you, had a UMX 15 months ago and have acquired such a wardrobe of Boobs Foobs and Prosthesis that one of our members here named their home in my dressing room \"The FoobMoire!\" I would suggest you take a look at the website breastfree.org, it is run by one of our members Erica and she has put together an extensive range of options for Prosthesis. Their is a lot of great information on that site. I discovered very early on, that my low neck tops, even T shirts had to go, and I have replaced everything with higher necklines so that when I bend forward, the gap is not visible. When you get into a silicone Prosthesis that gap can be more visible as the heavy prosthesis falls forward. I have also discovered that I like to wear sports crop tops that can take a light weight foam foob. They are not as structured as a real Mx bra and feel very light, firm against the chest, which I like and they prevent \"fall forward\"! Obviously they can't be worn all the time, but they are a great alternative for casual wear. I find I am wearing casual yoga pants, crop bra, with an Active Wear jacket zipped up to show the crop a little as my casual or relaxing wear. I would definitely suggest that you get properly fitted for your silicone prosthesis and Mx bras. I did that and then started to find things after I knew what worked for me. I have bought many prosthesis and bras, all new, on Ebay, with great success. Their are a multitude of styles out there, many of them are nice to look at too. You don't have to sacrifice nice lingerie, just because you need a Mx bra. Remember you need to wait at least 6 weeks! Also, take a look at the Mx camisoles, there are quite a few manufacturers who make them, my fave is the Valletta by Amoena. They have a bra inside, more structured than say a Genie bra, but less structured than a full Mx bra. They work very well alone, under a shirt, cardigan or jacket. I have them in about 4 colors, once you get the straps fitted right, it will sit flat against your chest and it feels great. I had the same problem that you do, in the very early days. The balancing act with a heavy \" C/D\" cup on one side can be a bit of an issue. I just put up with the riding up of the fiber filled foob, till I got fitted. I did buy Genie Bras from a department store, you know the knitted type with no wires or hooks, and I found a Target Post Surgery stretch cotton bra that had the hooks in the front because I had a bit of an issue with cording, so stretching to get the other ones over my head was a bit of a challenge. I also bought some micro bead Foobs from a lovely lady named Mary at mastectomysolutions.com she has the pattern for making them if you are a sewer, or she will make them for you for a very small charge. Mary's website is great too, she has lots of very good info there, in fact it was Mary who taught me to hand wash my Mx bras and use a salad spinner to get the water out before hanging out to dry. Great advice for caring for expensive bras. Although I have several silicone Prosthesis, even one called the \"Contact\" which has a sticky surface so it adheres to the skin of your chest and can be worn with a normal bra, without pockets. I do tend to wear my Tru Life weighted foam form a lot these days, but it is all just a matter of personal choice. The one great thing I can tell you Mella, is that it doesn't take long, till you just put the bra and form on and that's the last time you think about it, till you remove it at night.   Please feel free to message me if there is anything else I can help you with. I am sure there will be others along to offer their ideas and tips too. I know it feels a bit overwhelming at first, bu it gets better and as we become more used to the \"New Normal\" things fit into place. I even go half flat sometimes, a shape wear firm tank rails in that \"D\" puppy and no one ever seems to notice. Take care Mella...have fun shopping for things that make you feel good! M x ",

I am not sure if you are searching for front closers, they do have a tendency to be a bit more structured to look at, but if you are just searching for Mx bras with pockets, take a look at the Amoena \"Mona\" bra, it has become one of my favorites and I know a lot of others here, have bought  this one too. It is a little structured with a stay in the side of it, but it is a very comfortable and doesn't feel like armor!  The trick is to try on lots of different styles in stores and if you find some you really like, you can search them out on the internet. For me, it is worth my while to do it that way because everything Mx related in Aus is just so expensive. Although I would prefer to keep my money in my region by frequenting local businesses I just can't justify the huge disparity in price. For instance the Mona bra is $88.00 here but I can find them for 2 for $70.00US, even with freight, it is just too much of a difference. It is the same with Forms, $90.00 for my favorite weighted foam Tru Life in Aus and 2 for $72.00US in the States. I just ordered 2 more at that price to put away till the demise of the one I am wearing now . There are some very reasonable deals at different Mastectomy suppliers in the US, but even there you can find some pretty big price differences.",

If you do a search on any of the subjects that interest you, I am sure you will find lots of chat going on and many great women to get to know! All the best, and I am sure I'll see you on the boards!",

I know it is hard to relax and turn off your brain. When I was going through the waiting stage I just had to say to myself, \"It will be what it is, and my stressing won't change that!\"\" I just have to try to keep busy till I get the tests done, and go from there.\" It did help me, and coming here was a great help too. I am sorry you have the other health issues to contend with. That's just an added burden when you are going through this stuff.

The Target bra is a good cotton, with stretch and at $20.00 here in Australia it is a much better price than that one. I don't know if it is available in the US. Here in Aus, I just searched \"Post Surgery\" on the Target website and there were several that appeared. I have tried them all, but this one was my favorite. Also, Amoena has a great range of all different types of Mx bras, try their website if you like the type featured in the link look for their cotton stretch, or there is a lace front hook style for leisure wear that you may like. Take a look at the Valletta Camisole with built in bra and pockets, it is very comfortable and handles a full weight silicone Prosthesis, or a light weight  really well. I wore one of these to my first BC meeting after my surgery and I was asked if my surgery had been delayed. None of the girls had ever seen one of these camis before and they couldn't believe how good it looked. I have also bought shape wear tanks that have pockets for those modesty pad things. I can get a weighted foam foob into those with a snip of the fabric, the firmness of the body of the tank keeps everything, including the foob in place. They work well under a shirt or waterfall cardigan.  The one thing I should mention, is that Mx bras are cut quite differently to normal bras. The cups have more coverage to be able to hide the Form and any concave parts of your chest and the best design element is the straps are cut toward the inner chest so you never have to worry about the straps falling down and the Form being exposed. Women who are smaller sizes seem to be able to get away with normal bras or having their old bras modified with a pocket, but my attempts to modify and keep some of my much loved lingerie failed, because the shapes are off now. I know I can sound like a broken  record about this, so forgive me if you've heard it before, but I will never wear an under wire bra again because a member here posted that she was stabbed by a wayward wire, in and area where she was still numb and she sustained a very bad infection from that. Once you begin to research what is available and find what suits your individual needs, you'll be surprised by how much is actually out there. Edited to add...I believe Nordstroms have a service where they will put pockets into bras bought from them.",

It is everyone's right to get a second opinion, and that is just what I would do. Pain isn't normal, but it isn't necessarily anything to do with cancer either. The chances of this being cancer are low, in fact, about 80% will turn out to be benign, but you won't know for sure till it is biopsied. I'd want to know why I am having pain, if nothing else.

I am a Uni, no reconstruction, so I have a remaining breast, but I can identify with the sensations you are experiencing. When people asked me about how this surgery felt, was it really painful? I always said, for me, not painful, in the traditional sense, but it is a surgery of very weird sensations. As dianeslm said, there is so much healing going on, there is a lot of nerve regeneration as nerves that were cut try to reattach, across the abyss. There are the drains, which are necessary, but uncomfortable and the relief when they are removed is something we all agree on. Then there is the possibility of a Seroma, which is a buildup of fluid, it may or may not be taken up by the body, or your Surgeon can extract it by syringe. The other very uncomfortable aspect of this surgery is the area under your arm where the Lymph Nodes have been disturbed by either a SNB or having more of the nodes removed. This is a very brutal surgery, many refer to it, as an amputation. I actually watched a Mx surgery on You Tube after my own Umx, not before, I wasn't that brave!LOL I wanted to see what was done that could manifest all these weird sensations. I now know and understand it better. There will be more sensations that you'll discover as time goes on, drinking cold water gives a Waterfall sensation inside your chest, don't panic, it goes away, as does the feeling that I named \"The Claw\" that feels much like sharp claw is holding your chest and underarm, this one really only comes at night and after a day when you have felt really good and have overdone it! We all do that! There is a feeling, much like raspy sunburn, which is nerve related too. The main thing for me was the abject tiredness, I could fall asleep mid sentence, in the first few weeks. I was religious with my PT exercises, from the day I left Hospital and I massaged my chest as soon as the incision was healed and the steri strips were gone. I drank gallons of water to flush the meds and anesthetic out of my system. I know it feels pretty awful right now, but it does get better and there are so many women here who can relate to the exact same things you're experiencing. Stick around and ask anything. I wish you both the very best for a speedy, uneventful recovery. ",

I went into my day of surgery with those descriptions vivid in my mind and terrified. I couldn't have given a crap about the Mx, I was just consumed with fear, irrational fear, of that SNB tracer. All I ask for, is a rational and reasonable explanation of these tests and procedures for the new women, who are coming here for support from others, who have been there, before them.    ",

Hi Abbey and Wendy and welcome to BCO. Sorry you have to be here.  You will find there will be lots of women who will help with support and will share their experiences.   As you can see, there are very different opinions and experiences with the SNB. It has been debated many times on these boards. No one really knows why it affects some people so badly and others not at all. When I spoke to my surgeon about the procedure, he was genuinely surprised that I was really concerned about it. He said he'd been doing this kind of surgery for many years and had never had any of his patients say it was a very painful procedure.  I went into mine on the morning of my UMx surgery, full of fear and trepidation because I had heard so many horror stories about how bad it was going to be. My Surgeon had given the OK, for me to have a numbing injection if I wanted it, but when I arrived early in the morning at the imaging department, the tech wasn't authorized to give lidocaine for this procedure. He rang my Surgeon at home and my Surgeon offered to drive down to administer the shot himself. There was no way I would allow him to come in early on a day when he'd be spending long hours in surgery, just for that. I am actually glad it happened that way. The tech talked me through the procedure. I had 4 shots into the areola and when I asked him when it was going to be painful, he said it was all over. I felt nothing, not even the needle, in that sensitive area, much less the tracer. It took several goes, for the tracer to actually get to the Sentinel Node. I had to massage for 20 minutes and then have another scan, on the 3rd attempt and the tech woo-hooed and came out with the film, showing the SN. He high fived me and took me up to surgery.   I have never experienced relief like that before, I felt like I was bulletproof and I breezed through the Umx, the blue dye was administered after I was anesthetized and I was out and home the following morning. Just like everything else, this a very personal experience. I just wish it could be painless for everyone.  ",

This went on for a couple hours, before the Sentinel Node lit up and this scanning machine was huge, not something they'd likely have access to in OR. I then went to surgery where the Surgeon told me he would inject the blue dye, after I was out and then he'd find the node with a hand scanner like a geiger counter. Is this the same procedure that everyone is talking about? ",

It may well be just a minor setback, where you have overdone it. Many of us have setbacks during recovery and seromas are extremely common. I had one to that I had drained and there were times I had to pull right back and take it easy, because my body decided I was doing too much. It probably isn't the exercises, but whatever else you are up to in your daily life that is giving you the discomfort. I know I had strict instructions not to lift anything over 10lbs for the first month, well my dog weighs twice that! It was tough to keep to all the rules and I definitely overstepped on more than one occasion, and paid for it with pain and the sensation I named \"The Claw\". I am 19 months out and I can still invoke that feeling, like there is a sharp claw holding my underarm and chest if I really do a lot of heavy work. I know what it is now and will pull back if it happens. Try not to give yourself a hard time about this, it is a process and it can feel like we are going backwards, but being kind to yourself, it will get better. I know we all just want to get back to where we were before, but for me at least, there are sensations that have just become the New Normal and they don't really bother me, this far down the road. If it were me, I'd see the Doctor, just to put my mind at rest and to see if the seroma needs to be drained. I think I mentioned in an earlier post that the SNB area was and is the most uncomfortable part for me, even now, it is numb and can get irritated if clothing rubs against it.   I hope things improve quickly for you, let us know how you get on. Edited to say... 4 weeks is such early days Alfieval. I remember at 4 weeks, I was still falling asleep mid sentence, so you've done very well! Take it easy!",

I have some of Colin's relatives coming to stay on Tuesday with a 4 month old. I have had to clear the junk I put in the guest room while the painters were in the house working and get the room ready for them. I have decided not to try again to keep in touch with the wife. I reached out, sent gifts, called several times, even called on the 1st anniversary to see how they were doing, but she never reciprocated. Just not meant to be. If you find the silicone prosthesis is too heavy for you, ask to try the lighter weight silicone which is available. I have found that many women here have gone for a fitting, only to be given something that the fitter thinks is right, when a lot more forms should have been tried, as other options. I know, I wasn't sure what I was looking for, at the beginning. I have actually moved on to mostly wearing a weighted foam leisure form. They are very cheap by comparison to the silicone, 2 for $72.00 or $40.00 each at MetroMedical.  I am not suggesting you should go for one of those over a silicone, if you're only allowed 1 through insurance. I much prefer wearing that, but still have my silicone forms for different bras etc.  I have a friend, whose DD is also looking at sperm bank baby, it is interesting isn't it! I am glad to see you're getting more movement from the exercises, that will make you feel better overall. I was tired beyond words after my surgery, it took a long time to get my energy back, even now I will have a nap occasionally in the afternoon. I go for my Yearly Mammo and U/S tomorrow, feels better than the last time, but I am still a little nervous. I don't think it will ever be easy. Take it easy, let me know how you appointment goes.

Just keep in mind that 80%+ of these things come back with a B9 result. The only difinitive way to know what is going on is with a Biopsy. Try to take it one small step at a time, and do your research here. Ask anything, there will always be someone around who can answer your queries. It is natural to over think this, and we all think every twinge is connected. I don't know too much about Fibromyalgia, but I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and just continue with the meds I take for that. Your Doctor will be able to clarify that for you.

Two weeks out is very early days and it is normal to still feel sore, there is a lot of nerve regeneration and internal healing going on. I think most here will tell you that the node removal side is the most uncomfortable part of this surgery. I had a Umx, no recon at Christmas 2012 and I have researched and found lots of foobs and Prosthesis, Camis, Sports Crop Tops,Tanks and Shape wear. Genie bras work very well with soft forms in the early months before being fitted for Mx bras and Prosthesis, if that's what you decide to do. Swimwear by Amoena and Lands End have suits that are higher at the front. I also have a Speedo racing swim suit,  for water aerobics, going half flat was not something I thought I would do, but it isn't a problem to me now. It depends on whether you have decided to go flat all the time, or if you choose to wear forms of some sort, that will define what kind of suit you buy. (pockets or no pockets). I also had some tissue left at the end of my incision line, which is often called a \"Dog Ear\". I found it annoying, because it would sneak out over the side of my bra and it also had a lot of nerve discomfort too. Although I didn't think I would ever want to have any more surgery, I decided about a year down the track, which was a couple of months ago, to have it removed. For me, it was the best thing ever. It is smooth and flat and I no longer have the feeling of live nerves zinging away in it. There are some pictures on Breastfree, the website  badger mentioned. It has lots of information. which I also found invaluable, when I was researching what was available. when I was new to this. There are so many options, I have bought everything from foobs, to bras, to swimwear, on Ebay, so I am not sure which item that you're referring to. Let us know if we can help any further.",

I still have a C/D \"rogue puppy\" on the other side, but I have put together a great array of Foobs and Prosthesis. There are so many different types available. When I first had my surgery I had a softee that came with a knit bra. I just pinned it inside a cami top. I was at the fitter a week after surgery for my fitting for the prosthesis! When they discovered I was only one week out from surgery they shooed me away, and wouldn't fit me till I was 6 weeks post op. If you have a Target nearby, just a man style shirt, cotton with some elastane is all you need. They work with capris or jeans, or a skirt. They make them in every size. A few different scarves take the eye away from the chest. I bought one black and one white, and wore them with tank tops or camis underneath, and a scarf. If it is cool at night, or you're going out, a pashmina draped around the shoulders in a contrast color or pattern can dress this plain shirt up. I also wore jewellry high on my chest with a couple of buttons undone. The sleeves rolled up and bangles also take the eye away from the centre of the body. I hope this has been of some help....Take care!",

I like to be really comfortable during my relaxation time and found this kind of casual wear took the pressure off when I was tender, and healing from the initial surgery and then when I had extra revision surgery. No one seems to notice when I go flat on that side One of my favorite forms is the weighted foam form by Tru Life, which doesn't weigh as much as the Silicone forms and feels really natural. I should mention too, that not all forms will be the same number size, they can vary quite considerably, so always check the size chart for the specific brand you are interested in, if you're purchasing without a fitter.  It is all just trial and error, you'll find what feels comfortable and suits you.",

I feel for you Cindee, but I think if you could get more information you my feel better about it. We all have a hard time with fear of the unknown. Try to be kind to yourself and get some rest.

I got caught up in a Public Holiday that stretched my waiting for my results for 11 long days and then my surgery was right on Christmas, same thing there, I had to wait till well into January for my final pathology. It was the worst feeling! When I went in for my first call back after my suspicious Mammogram, the Radiographer asked me if all the little bruises on my breast, were from me feeling for a lump. I told her I had become obsessed with trying to find something, that I must have missed in my self exams. She said I would never have found anything, but that I wasn't alone, she sees these bruises all the time! LOL I know how hard it is to relax while you wait, but the one thing I did learn, was that worrying will not change the outcome, but it can make you sick and it's wasted time. that could have spent doing something you enjoy.  I wish you all the very best with your results!",

I knew from the very beginning that recon would never, be something I could do. I don't have anything against anyone else doing it and I love it when I hear a good recon result story, but as Glennie said, having that foreign thing inside me, was not something I could deal with, either! I also couldn't in good conscience, remove my healthy breast, but that is just me.I had a Mother who was a Uni, so I was fortunate, to have her experience to draw on and for me, having a functioning, healthy breast, is a good thing! I am very similar to TB, in that, I have a very understanding husband who made certain I would never have any self esteem issues, right from the get go. I must admit to feeling a tad apprehensive, but when he saw my scar, for the first time, the morning after my surgery, he said \"Wow! that will heal really well, you don't need 2 boobs to be gorgeous!\" That set the scene for me and I haven't looked back. If he feels like that, I couldn't care less, what anyone else thinks! We also have a lot of lighthearted banter, with my adult daughter joining in, too. I feel much like TB, I haven't any ongoing issues My Husband has no issue whatsoever with the way my chest looks or feels, in fact we really like how I can snuggle in closer to him in bed and I can feel his heart, through my flat side. I have a huge collection of foobs, boobs and prosthesis, lingerie with pockets and clothing that can hold my forms too. One of our members here, actually named the place I keep everything \"The FoobMoire\" LOL We all have funny stories about foobs, but like the others, I just don't think about it any more. Once I decide what I am wearing each day, that's it, till I take that outfit and foob off, at night. I occasionally go half flat and even though I am a \"D\" on the remaining side, I can wear a firm, shape wear tank top and no one notices. I wish you all the very best, with your decision and hope hearing from the 3 of us, who have very similar stories, may help you in some small way. There will be others along, who will share their experiences too! ",

I totally agree that it is a huge and very personal decision, and there are as many reasons for the decisions as there are women here on this Forum! AZ has given you insight into the BMX she chose. I am wading in with the UMX or single Mx, and SNB that I chose. I was Dx with stage 0, grade 3, I was given the option of a lumpectomy and Radiation or a Umx. I didn't want to do the radiation if there was any way to avoid it, so I chose to have the single Mx and took the chance that there wouldn't be any little surprises that would indicate I would need Radiation after that surgery. I was very fortunate that I had no invasion, and my margins were clear. I never really considered doing a BMX, my Mother had a UMX back in the 90's and I believe her way of dealing with it and my exposure to her journey made it an easier choice, for me. I also chose not to reconstruct and haven't looked back, or regretted either of my decisions. I am 15 months out from surgery, and although I was a bit nervous at my first follow up appointment and first Mammogram, I am feeling more confident now and don't have the fear I had initially, about a possible problem in my remaining side.   Living with one breast is a bit of a challenge at the start, but once you realize what suits you and find what is comfortable for you, then when you find the right bras and Prosthesis, it all gets much easier. I wish you all the very best with your decision. You will know what feels right for you!",

The barrier failed and he fell out onto the concrete tarmac, shattering his shoulder and his foot. It took many operations to repair his injuries, and he was laid up for a long time. Someone told him about the Rites, so he tried them out very slowly, till he could add to them and finally accomplish the 21reps after almost a year. He still does 21 reps a day, years after his accident. When my friend heard of my Dx, he got in touch with me and hassled me till I promised to try these Rites. I am so grateful I listened. He still emails me all the time to make sure I am not being tardy! He is totally devoted to the Rites, and swears it was the reason he was able to recuperate so well and is doing better, generally, than before his accident. It is very important to start at 3 reps and stay there as long as you need to. Only increase by one or two reps a week. It doesn't matter if you can't manage the 21 reps, you wouldn't believe the improvement after even a short time at 3 reps. Take care, and enjoy!",

Please make the decision based on what you want, not what someone else thinks you should do. If you decide that you don't want recon, you must make sure your Surgeon is on the same page, you need to make your wishes very clear. I told my Surgeon I wanted a very straight scar and flat chest. There isn't any rush, I was assured that I could always reconstruct later if I changed my mind. I can't see it ever being something, I'd want to do, but it is good to have the option.You'll be surprised how many of us there are, both Uni's and BMX.

I also checked out breastfree.org and the Scar Project too. The truth be known though, having had a Mother, who was also a Uni, made it much easier for me. Her scar was not the best looking scar, she had a radical Umx and full Axillary clearance in '94, just 4 months after we lost my Dad. I must have learned a lot from her, without even realizing it. She was a very sophisticated, well groomed lady, but she handled being Dx and losing her breast with such grace, at such an emotional time, but she also had a wicked sense of humor, which got her through, too!

It is a nerve wracking time after the surgery, waiting for the final pathology. It is very unlikely that they could tell anything during the surgery, it needs to be a Pathology report done on the tissue, to be sure of anything. My final Pathology took a long time to come back because my surgery was right before Christmas and the labs were closed over the Christmas break. Try not to be worrying too much about the final Pathology, just try to relax and be kind to yourself, while you heal from this surgery. I know how easy it is to overdo it, when you think you're feeling ok, but your body will let you know that it is time to slow down again.

For me, apart from a tiny sting for a second, when they put in the numbing agent they were both completely painless. There is a clicking sound as the cores are taken by the gun. The radiographers both talked me through what they were doing and in my first one the Radiographer explained it all as they took each core and it was displayed on a large screen. Holding the position was a little tiring, but totally doable. Although the Birads 5 has the higher possibility of malignancy, there have been women here, who have still received a B9 result.

I know just how you're feeling, I was so disappointed when I discovered I had this shelf under my arm and it zapped and zinged from the cut nerves. I put up with it for about 15 months, hoping it may get better with time. I had spoken to my surgeon about it, very early on and although I don't blame him for it, I wanted it explained. He explained that it is actually flesh, that used to be pulled forward, by the weight of the breast and when they are doing the Mx surgery , they have to stop the incision somewhere, so sometimes that flesh remains and becomes a pouchy, dog ear. I felt just like you, I didn't want more surgery, but I certainly didn't want to put up with this thing either. Initially my surgeon wanted me to go into Hospital and have it done, with a general anesthetic. I hate how the drugs make me feel, so I asked him to do it with a local anesthetic, he wasn't convinced at first, but he finally agreed. He hadn't done this kind of revision without anesthetic before, in fact he said it is rare for women to do this revision at all, but he is really pleased with the result, as I am. In saying this, it isn't for everyone, to have it done this way, but for me, it was very easy, the actual surgery took about 35 minutes. The final result that you saw on breastfree, was pretty good, but now, about a year later, it is barely visible and no discomfort from the nerves, just numb. The revision added abut 7cm or 3\" to the original scar and the recovery was actually similar to the Mx, no lifting, or stretching for a few weeks, a little discomfort, but it healed very quickly and I really couldn't be happier with the result. I'd do it again, in a heartbeat! Please feel free to ask anything, PM me, if you like. Just know, if you want to repair it, it can be done at any point, there is no rush! It is very early days for you and things will change over the next few months. I wish you all the best with it.",

The BMX bras have two pockets sewn inside to take a prosthesis, so you purchase the bra in your regular size and then get the prosthesis to fit. Using just one side for a UMX. It is too early for you to be wearing a prosthesis, that fitting is usually done at about 6 weeks. If you feel you need something now, could I suggest an Ahh Bra, or Wonder Bra from a department store with a soft puffy inside? Do you have a camisole with a puffy inside it?

I am very pleased you have this Dx, but I am sorry you had to feel that dreadful fear.  All the very best!",

You have definitely come to the right place for both information and support. There will always be someone around if you need to vent or just want to touch base with someone. It is a very scary time when we are waiting for appointments and tests etc, but it is important to always remember that more than 80% of these issues turn out to be B9, so the odds are in your favor! In saying that, we all understand that terrible fear when we know nothing and are fearing the worst. I can't tell you what your symptoms are, but I can say, there are lots of other things it could  be. You are doing the right thing by following up and going forward. Try to be kind to yourself while you wait. Do things you enjoy, maybe spoil yourself a little and please stay away from Google. There is a lot of out of date irrelevent info there that will scare you! This is the place to get your information. The time will pass and it will be Tuesday before you know it.

I did the PT exercises religiously for many, many, months post surgery. I agree with Carol about doing the neck stretches, seeing a PT about having individualized exercises is a good idea. I started having remedial massage with myofascial release on my chest, about 6 weeks after Surgery. I have a heated spa at home which I have been using with a temperature around 30c which is quite a bit cooler than my daily shower at 40c. Although I've used Acupuncture for pain before, with good results, it isn't something I have tried since the Mx because of the fears of LE. I hope you get relief from the pain you're experiencing.",

That is the only way to get a definitive answer. The truth is, more than 80% of  these breast issues are benign, so don't give up hope, that you'll be in that group:) Try not to read too much into the speed of the appointments either, sometimes they just manage to get you in fast, which is a great thing because the waiting for the test results is just the worst. Don't beat yourself up about not knowing what to ask, no one is prepared for this stuff and you'll find out a lot more when you go further into the testing. Your Doctor is being very pro active, making sure you follow up, many women don't! Most of us suggest that you take someone with you if you can, when you are seeing the Doctors, it can be easy to not retain what they, say because you are stressed. Try to take it easy, a step at a time, let us know how you're getting on. Hugs to you!",

I know this will sound weird, but I read your post and then really thought about what may be a real pain in the butt about being a Uni and I really can't think of anything, that really bugs me any more. I am 2 years out now and I have spent quite a lot of time and effort, to find the clothing that really works for me, that includes properly fitted bras, camisoles and tops. When I was new to this and getting used to being a Uni, I did have a pet hate, which was what I call, \"Fall Forward\". It was when I would lean forward while wearing a less than perfect neckline and the silicone foob and bra would fall away from my chest, exposing my flat side. It happened in a supermarket one morning, as I put the things from the cart onto the counter. I looked up, as I heard a slight gasp from the checkout girl, who quickly looked away. I went home and went through my wardrobe, removing every low cut, or wide neck top.LOL For me, getting properly fitted by an experienced and well trained fitter, for Mx bras, forms and clothing, has made life much easier. I barely notice that I am wearing a foob at all now and the right bra means, I am comfortable, all day. I am sure the others will be along and will have experiences to share with you. All I can say, is take your time with your decision, make it all about you and what feels right, for you! Good Luck!",

I was happy with that, not because I could see me ever considering it, but just to know that you can, if you want to. I mentioned on another thread, the difference in the numbers of women opting for reconstruction in Australia seems to be much lower than the US and Canada. I don't know the actual country wide stats, but my surgeon was telling me that in the 4 years he has been practicing here, in Australia, he has done about 200 Mx surgeries and of those 200, only 2 women had decided to reconstruct. Also, the BC support group I am involved with has 23 members, most of whom had Mx surgeries, only 1 has reconstructed, and like your sister, she decided to do it many years after, her original surgery.",

You're right, they can't give a definitive answer till a Biopsy has been done! There is a wise member here who says, \"don't go there till you have to!\" Hard I know:) I have to say, that checking Dr Google is not the best thing to be doing right now, there is so much unreliable info to scare you.

I have been wearing these Sports Bras, Camis and Tanks with the little \"Modesty Pads\" in them since I had my Umx. I find them super comfortable, but because I am a Uni with a \"D\" on the other side I have to use a lighter weight Foob inside them. The silicone Prosthesis I would wear in a Mx bra, is too heavy for these and will pull them down. I discovered a company called Marika which is a yoga and Active wear company. They have the best sales, with their Clearance area often offering a further 50% off, so a $60.00 sports crop with pockets can often cost just $9.00. These were never intended for Mx prosthesis, and you need to be sure the one you like is not too low cut, but I remove the pads and insert my own foob. They also have work out tops that have the same pockets at fantastic prices. Either of these types of tops with an active wear zip jacket and a pair of either yoga pants or capri pant makes for a very smart, comfortable, casual outfit.    Fortunately, for you, the size you want to be, is entirely up to you after this surgery, so you can wear these tops with just the pads provided, or if you want a small size you can use either little chicken filets, micro bead foobs or my favorite, the light weighted Foam form. You may even decide to remain flat. It is all up to you. These are all very inexpensive options.",

I even had one snap when I was turning in bed one night. I was told it was rare too, and that they were nothing to be worried about, that they resolve themseves. Mine disappeared at about 8 weeks or so, but that was after constant massaging, several times a day. I also did a massage every day under the running water in the shower. I have regular massages, by a remedial therapist, and she would massage these tight bands quite deeply. It hurt a bit, but it was a great relief when they disappeared. I don't have any LE, and had a full range of motion very soon after surgery. I did do some research, and found that this is actuallly quite common after breast augmentation surgery. It is also a bit of a strange thing because when tested these ords sometimes turn out to be lymph, and other times thet are a vein that is thrombotic or a phlebitis. The reading I did, described it as something that can occur after any trauma to the breast. The kicker is, that it can reappear, as you've discovered.

I haven't had any negative reactions, or any of those \"oh poor you\" comments. I showed my chest to my Husband the day after my surgery, when I got home from the Hospital, when it was at its worst. I had purchased several pairs of pajamas, thinking I would have to cover up, where I never had before, but his reaction of \"Hey, that will heal really well and You don't need 2 boobs to be gorgeous!\" was all I needed to feel confident and the pajamas went straight to the Opp Shop. Almost 2 years on and I still don't have any reservations about my Husband seeing my chest. One of my favorite things, if you can call it that, is how I can snuggle closer to my Husband now and I can feel his heartbeat, through my flat side. My situation is a little different too. My Husband is a C5/6 quadriplegic, from a hang gliding accident 37 years ago, so having lived through his struggle since we got together, over 15 years ago, has given me a different perspective on how this surgery affected me. His total and unswerving support for me, has also made it a pretty easy transition. My Mother had a radical Mx, in '94, just 4 months after we lost my Dad. I looked after her after her surgery and her amazing attitude and wicked sense of humor gave me insight, that I didn't really know I had absorbed, which has helped me a lot, with adjusting too. crystalphm makes a very good point, I know that I would never have been comfortable with reconstruction either. So it is what it is.   ",

I am another who had high grade DCIS found in my biopsy. I was offered a Lx with Rads or a Umx with a SNB, provided there was nothing invasive found in the final pathology. For a number of reasons, I decided to go for the Umx and SNB, I truly never considered removing my other breast and for me, taking the risk that there was no invasion, requiring more treatment, paid off. I knew recon was not for me either, so I was another, who had a pretty easy time, when it came to the Mx surgery and recovery. It isn't an easy decision that you have to make, but it has to be your decision, one you feel confident about. Try not to be influenced by what others think is right, for you. I am just 2 years out from my Dx and surgery and had my 2 year checkup just 2 days ago. I must say that in the beginning, I was nervous when the appointment and testing was close and even though I have had one scare, that required another biopsy, I don't regret any of my decisions. I wish you all the very best , with your decision making and with your recovery, let us know how you get on. ",

My Surgeon told me it would dissipate by the 12 month mark. I still get it occasionally and I am over 2 years out now. The only thing I can suggest for you is to get a fairly rough towel and rub your back as though you were drying it after a shower. That is about the only thing that gives me any relief. My Surgeon said the Phantom Itch is caused by the regeneration of the nerves from the back, to the front where they were severed in the surgery, so this rough towel treatment can usually satisfy the itch at the front, if you scratch the nerve that is causing it at the back. I think your rash is a completely different thing cattywompus. I wonder if it may be worth trying something really simple, like cornflour, the next time you get the rash. It may be caused by warmth and perspiration and the cream is making it worse. Just a thought.",

A few weeks later she was in Hospital having a radical Mx and Axillary clearance . I was terrified for her. She came down with a terrible infection, which almost took her from me. Fortunately, she made it, but through it all, she never lost her dignity, or her wicked sense of humor. I was in awe of that scar, and how she dealt with it all. I am certain that my own experience would have been very different, had I not had her as my roll model. My Mother never had any recurrence, that we were aware of. Sadly several years later, dementia came calling and eventually robbed her of all her memories. Somehow, she never forgot me, and would light up when she saw me. I visited her every day in the nursing home where she passed away 9 years later. There's not a day, I don't think of her, and feel grateful to have had her as my Mother.",

Part way through the class another woman pointed out to her that something had come out of her suit, The wash cloth did a perfect impersonation of a jellyfish, all the way to the bottom of the pool. They had a laugh about it and my friend bought a swim form. The points that Erica makes about not showering at the gym or wearing a suit in a hot tub brings this conversation back to how we behaved before this surgery and makes a very valid point. I doubt there would be too many of us, who would start doing things differently now, like exposing ourselves in these situations, when we hadn't done that before:) I haven't ever been particularly concerned, about undressing or showering at the gym and I have always been comfortable naked, in front of my man. I think my concerns, at the beginning for me, were if those things would change, because of my altered appearance, not so much about how I personally felt about it, because I was good with it, but because, of the perception of others. It was more to do with me feeling I may be forced to change how I am, to accommodate the feelings of others. Does that make any sense? Also, like Erica, my Husband, in fact my family, Daughter included, have a healthy sense of humor about it, just as we always have had, about the quadriplegia. One of the very first \"icebreaker\" moments when I got home after the surgery was when the 3 of us were sitting outside having a meal, my Daughter was playing old music on her phone, she put on Hotel California, I remember saying \"Oh wow, this is the first time I have ever heard this song, with one breast!\" my Husband didn't miss a beat, saying \"Well, it's just as well it's in mono!\"",

Put that together with what a station allows during certain times and to different demographics and you get, what we see.  When I worked in a TV station, years ago, there were so many words that weren't  even allowed, to be said on air, \"diarrhea\" being one. That was a long time ago, but just illustrates things that were not permitted, that viewers weren't aware of. Although different again, but I believe is somewhat relevant. I worked on the Children's Hospital Telethon for the same TV Station. We would go to the Hospital at 4am a week before the Telethon to shoot footage of the kids waking up and to shoot cute kids with plaster casts and stitches. We were guided by the Hospital's media person to the wards we could shoot in. During the downtime, I started to chat with parents whose children were in the burns unit or the cancer wards, they were very accepting of the fact that we were there to shoot footage for the Telethon and most wanted their children to be shown, both to help raise money and to show what some families were going through. Did any of those stories make it to air, not a single one, we weren't even permitted to shoot the kids from those wards, because that might have been uncomfortable, for the viewers and other children, watching the Telethon to see. I believe things have change a bit since then and it isn't so horrific to see someone with a bald head from chemo, or bad burns and scars, but our news is still sanitized, to a degree.   I expect that is why some celebs choose to do a blog, to share what they can't speak about during interviews. Just saying.....  ",

I was attracted by the name of this thread, although I am not stage 4, I would let you know of my little bit of experience. I was just recently contacted by my local BC group to attend their meetings. They had been notified about me by the McGrath Foundation Breast Nurse in our area. I went to my first meeting just before my surgery, and before I had a final pathology report. They were very welcoming, about a dozen ladies, all with different BC diagnosis, some going back 25 years, some new like me, and some still undergoing treatment.   Anyway, the main focus of that first meeting was their recent day trip to the Living Centre in Melbourne. They had been taken by bus, about 300km to Melbourne which had been subsidised by the local bank. They were treated to an afternoon of pampering at the centre and were even given gifts of lingerie (mastectomy bras). I was really impressed when I heard about their outing. I guess there wasn't any mixing with other members though. This was a one off visit for them as a group. I am really sorry that you had that experience at the centre. Different situation, I know. I have since been to another meeting with this group, and although some discussed where they were up to with their treatments, and one who was missing because of surgery for a new primary. Cancer was the least of the subjects discussed. This group meets regularily and fundraises for BC. They offer support to each other regardless of their BC stage, and organise speakers for their meetings, or outings for the members.   I was a bit retiscent about going again after my UMx and Dx of pure DCIS with no more treatments required, but I was convinced by the other members that this was a group that was actually started by someone with the exact same Dx as me, and that my input was valuable, so I continue to be involved and enjoy the company of the others I have met there.    I hate discrimination of any kind, but I am pro choice. In saying that, I totally get it if women in a different situation, say stage 4, prefer to be in a group that is all stage 4, then so be it. Sure, I don't have experience of what someone with stage 4 goes through, but that doesn't mean I can't be there as a friend to support them if they need it. We are from a small town, which I am sure is different to setting up groups in the city, we don't have the numbers for specialised groups.   Renae, I hope you can either find, or start a group near you. Perhaps the McGrath Foundation may be able to put you in touch with others in your location. I wish you all the very best. I don't want to offend anyone here, I absolutely know how incredibly fortunate I am, there's no sobbing from this gal! ",

I didn't realize it at the time, but her attitude and her grace must have made an impression on me. Even though she wasn't here for my Dx or Surgery, she passed in 2003 from an unrelated illness. I believe she paved the way for me, and my experience was much easier because of that. I wish you and all the others here, all the very best. You've got a great little group going here:)",

It isn't unusual to have the issues you describe, after these procedures. They are invasive and can cause scar issue to form inside the breast, especially if you have such dense breasts and they were digging around. It is also possible to have nerve damage. If you have concerns about there being any low grade infection, you should keep an eye out for any redness and check if you have a fever.

I had the same for my original Dx so I am already stressing that this is worse than I thought. The Doctor took the first core and the lump just disappeared, so it was a cyst! Of course, I still have to wait for the final Pathology, but the Doctor was  cautiously optimistic that it will be a good result. I didn't feel a thing, the anesthetic probably wasn't even needed, because it was injected into a completely numb part of my chest, if it hadn't been for the click of the biopsy gun, I wouldn't even know it had been done. I have a little soreness this morning, in the part of my chest that still has some feeling, but it's really minimal.

So difficult to know what to do when you are far from home and have to uproot children and make a big move. I wouldn't presume to suggest what you should do, but just wanted to say Hi when I read your post. I know what it's like to be wandering around the house at 4am when everyone else is asleep and your brain won't stop. One thing I will say is that the move will be stressful no matter when you do it. Would you feel more at ease at home with family and friends nearby, and knowing your daughter has a network to support her? May will come around pretty fast too, and then you'll have all of that support for the next part of the journey. You really just have to try to decide what is going to be best for you. It may be hard, but you have to put yourself first right now. I had just made a big move when I was diagnosed, it had been almost a year of selling, buying and renovating. The stress was pretty awful, then just when everything had settled down I got this. Not suggesting it is anything like what you are going through, but I know the feeling of making the big move. There is every chance that there will be someone along who can offer you advice because they have been in the same situation. All I can say is take care, and please come here often to touch base, it is a wonderful place for support and advice. Try to get some rest, and not worry too much. Easier said than done I know. ",

I would imagine that a Biopsy would be the next step \"if\" it is required, and it is always good to have the opinion of a BS on these matters. It is still very likely that you will have nothing that requires any action.

My surgeon said he doesn't want to remove too much of it during surgery, so it doesn't affect range of motion by being too tight. I was told that I can have it removed if it continues to be an issue. Mine has changed a lot in the 10 months since my surgery, so I think I will see how it goes during the Summer, and decide later if I want to remove it. The thing I hated the most about it was having to tuck it into my bra, uggghhh, but fortunately, it isn't such an issue now, it has gone down considerably. I have changed to bras with a higher side to accommodate it better.",

I call this, the surgery of strange sensations. I did my exercises religiously and I have massaged my chest every day to avoid adheasions and I believe this has helped in both acceptance and in helping with these unusual sensations. I have just had some revision surgery for my \"Dog Ear\" at the end of my incision this week and have felt some zingers again. At least I know what they are this time:) Nerve regeneration, adheasions, scar tissue, they can all cause pain or discomfort, but hopefully they will either disappear with time, or we just become so used to them that they no longer bother us.",

In saying that, I am sure these have a place and there are people who find them ideal for their situation. If you like the idea of these, take a look at the Contact by Amoena, they can't be used till about 6 months after surgery, but they attach to the chest, like the custom ones and can be worn with a normal bra, or you can put a backing sheet on them and wear in a pocket. There are many options available in breast forms, both silicone or weighted foam, or micro beads if you want no weight at all. It is always a good idea to go to a good fitter about 6 weeks after your surgery, when everything has settled down and try on lots of options in both breast forms, bras and even camisoles or clothing with the pocketed bras inside them. I tried on many styles and found the right drape of breast form and the size that suits me, Then I was confident to buy online from Ebay and at sales. Feel free to ask any questions here, there are many of us who have decided to forgo reconstruction and have tried many different types of forms.",

I can understand the feelings of frustration and fatigue, It's a huge life changer, all this surgery and treatment stuff, and it can leave some men in a quandary about what is going to be the norm, after everything settles down. There is the fear of hurting you and maybe you really don't want to reveal your chest, like you used to. It's uncharted territory, and unless you can both get all your feelings and opinions out there, it can cause problems down the track, that could be averted, because each of you are surmising what the other wants. I am a much older woman than you, but my Husband, who is also awesome:), and I have discussed everything to do with this journey, and although it was ultimately my decision, I took all of his opinions into consideration. In my case, I chose not to reconstruct, but my Husband was right behind that decision, because he didn't want me to have more surgery if it could be avoided. Had I wanted to reconstruct he'd have supported that too. I was concerned that things may change a bit, because of my changed appearance and I even bought pajamas to wear after the surgery, I had always been a \"knickers only\" sleeper. After the first awkward reveal, of my Umx, I realized that nothing had really changed, he said \"Oh wow, that will heal really well! and \"You don't need 2 boobs to be gorgeous!\" that was it, the new pajamas went to the local Opp Shop.  I know this is sounding very simplistic, there is obviously stuff that we all have to work through in our relationships, but keeping it light and keeping the lines of communication open, is very important.  I have discovered a positive in being a Uni, I can snuggle much closer and can feel his heart through my flat side:) ........Just saying!

I had a great experience here when I was in the waiting phase. I was terrified and had women reach out to me. All I am doing is paying it forward. I am sincerely hoping you find that you have nothing to worry about. This site is mainly made up of women who have been diagnosed. The vast majority of people who come here get a B9 result and move on with their lives.

Fortunately, we don't see much of that  here anymore:) My surgeon was actually surprised when I told him how nervous I was about this procedure, he offered me whatever I needed, but when I discovered the tech wasn't qualified to give injections of numbing agents with the tracer and then he actually rang my Surgeon, who was prepared to come early to the Hospital, to administer it himself, I decided against it. I didn't have any numbing agent and the tech who did mine talked me through the whole procedure. He gave me 4 injections into the nipple and I asked him, when was it going to hurt, he told me it was all over, except for the scan. For me it was a total non event.  I had to massage the tracer through and do the scan a few times, but when that node showed up the Tech gave me a high five and took me up to the O.R. I felt like I was bulletproof! the Mx was a breeze after that. The blue dye was done after I was anesthetized. I think it is important to know, not everyone has exactly the same experience, with this procedure, but so long as you remember, it is over very quickly.   I did enjoy, being able to tell the ones who scared me, that mine wasn't at all like theirs!",

I don't know why, but that seemed to take the edge right off it. I must have looked strange with my hand down my shirt! Thankfully that sensation disappeared, only to be replaced with other weird sensations, like the itching, and the zappy electric feeling, buzzy things. Sorry that I can't explain these things better, but others I have spoken to agree that this is a good description:) For me, as time has gone by, everything has lessened, but I still call this the surgery of strange sensations. I met with my Surgeon a couple of weeks ago and discussed all of these strange things, and yes, it is the nerves trying to regenerate and meet their other half across the abyss! My surgeon told me that the itching should subside by the one year mark, but there are others here still experiencing it years after surgery. I hope to be rid of it, but it isn't the worst thing I've ever had, so we shall see.  I hope your \"sunburn\" isn't with you for too much longer....Take care..",

So I was in the same position that your Daughter is in, right now. I was so grateful that we were close enough, for me to be a part of the whole journey. I was able to be involved in every aspect, I am sure your Daughter wants to be involved and is very glad that you are living closer to her. I was grateful to be able to give back just a fraction of what my Mother had done for me through my life. She was never a burden. My Mother had a radical Mx in '94, and passed in '03 of an unrelated illness. We had always been close, but going through that terrible time together, brought us even closer together. I would do it again, in a heartbeat. Please let your daughter be involved as much as she wants to. She's been through a lot losing her Dad. She'll want to help you all she can.

I used it from day 1, and I am still using it 7 months later, simply for comfort. I am completely healed, but this pillow just makes sitting for any length of time really comfy. I discovered that just bending over made it easy to wash my hair under the shower, and the same went for the hairdryer too. I would expect that 3 weeks to get back to work is doable. It will depend on how well you heal, but I was in town shopping at the Boxing Day sales after surgery on the 19th December, with my drain in a shoulder bag!

In saying that, I don't have any regrets, because my shirts and the bag did the job just fine. I also meant to say that I wore a lanyard around my neck with the drain attached when I first had a shower, but the tubing on my single, but really big drain, was so long that I could drape it on the floor of my shower, out of the way. I can't recall the exact set of exercises that my Mother did, but it became a running family joke that if you couldn't find her, she'd be doing the finger crawl up the wall somewhere in the house:) I did one set of my 4x a day exercises in the shower every day too, which I think helped a lot.

I know you are convinced that this clip is the reason for your symptoms and I am not here to try to dissuade you, but I wonder if you are also aware of all the other things that have Nickel in them which could be adding to your load of Nickel, if in fact there is any Nickel, in your marker. Jewelery is just one thing, money, zips, studs, cooking utensils, cell phones, bra hooks, eye glass frames, brass items, pens, are just some of the everyday items containing Nickel. Then there are all the foods that contain nickel which include chocolate, beans, lentils, peas, asparagus, cabbage, corn, mushrooms even dairy products and tea, just to name a few. The list of foods is very extensive, but having had allergy problems in the past, I know, if you can lighten your allergy load, things can change quite dramatically and quickly.  I would suggest, if you haven't already tried to reduce your load, give it a try and see if your symptoms diminish. You may find that you can control your symptoms with that alone and won't need to worry about removing the clip. Take care!",

I agree with the others that there would have to be an area of suspicion for them to biopsy, and perhaps a MRI would be the next step. Try not to get too far ahead of yourself . It is very easy to feel the fear and imagine all sorts of negative things are going on.There are many reasons for breast pain and BC really doesn't figure too highly with pain. It can happen, but it isn't a general symptom. Try to take it a step at a time, I know it's hard, but even if you do need a Biopsy, they are very doable.

I believe there is such a bra and I think it is a \"Nearly You\", if you can't find it, I think Erica from Breastfree.org knows about it. It may be on her website, if not maybe you could send her a PM to ask about it. There is also another company I have read about, who do a custom bra with prosthesis built in. Perhaps if you google you'll find what is available. I haven't heard how these wear, I think I have only seen one member write that she'd tried this type of garment. I imagine they won't be as long wearing as a form that you can move from bra to bra, to camisole to, say a T shirt with pockets.    There are many options for you, particularly being an A or B cup, you can wear Genie style bras and Camisoles with just the modesty pads that they come with or with small weighted foam forms, or even just the small silicone \"chicken filets\" which are available from department stores.  There are many women here who can get by with the Coobie and other similar bras because of their smaller size. I wish you all the very best for your surgery, just keep in mind that you can't be fitted for bras and prosthesis till 6 weeks post surgery. If you decide to buy a soft bra and light foobs for the interim make sure you wash the bra before wearing. I made the mistake of trying on a bra without washing it first and I got an infection in my incision line. I'm fairly sure this was the cause, because I was so careful otherwise.

It felt like big ropey lumps, and was so tight that I could feel it pulling if I stood up very straight. Fortunately, it passed and became just another weird thing that went with this surgery. January will be here before you know it, and if it hasn't just passed on it's own you'll get your answers. Paynesville is an absolutely magic place, despite the name. We decided we had one more move, or build in us. We wanted a coastal environment with absolute water views and managed to get it all. We have only been here since end of June 2012, so just as we were settling in after a huge renovation and move from Melbourne, I was Dx, after a routine Mammo. Yes it's very scenic, gorgeous place, and the people are so wonderful and welcoming. Not many are actually from here, but have found their way, as we did, almost by accident and have stayed. I absolutely believe, that my fast and relatively easy recovery was due to being in this wonderful place and I will be forever grateful that I had my Mammo here. We had just had the newest state of the art machine installed in the nearest big town. Had I gone to my regular place in Melbourne my Dx may not have happened, because I'm not sure they had the new machine at that time. I call it serendipity!",

I have found many really good products. I have a concave area, but it is below my incision almost under my arm, so it isn't too difficult to  dress with a gap there.  Here in Aus they are obsessive about us doing exercises 4x per day, so range of motion and a bit of muscle building are taken care of early on. I am wondering what kind of bra you are wearing this prosthesis in? Is it sitting flat against your chest with the straps adjusted? There is a thing called \"Fall Forward\" that happens when we bend over and the weight of the prosthesis falls forward exposing the gap. The best way to avoid this is to seek out either a Mx camisole that is cut higher on the chest with pockets for your prosthesis built into it. There are some tops that have the higher neckline, but they aren't as easy to find as you'd think. Amoena make my favorite Mx cami & T shirt, called the Valletta. They have a shelf bra built in. There is also the Contact Prosthesis, which actually attaches to the chest and eliminates gaps. It can be worn with a normal bra, but be very careful of under wires, they can be very dangerous if you are numb and a wire comes loose. Another type of Prosthesis is a \"U\" shape and it can be rotated, to fit flatter against the chest. Good Luck with finding things that you'll feel comfortable in, it's a lot of trial and error, and I have found that there is no Prosthesis that is just perfect for every outfit. There are some quite cheap light weight foam or Micro bead foobs that can be worn in say a sports bra or crop top under a shirt or a tank that are so comfy and don't fall forward.  ",

I am very flat, except for my Dog Ear, under my arm. That has improved too, quite considerably. I am sure a lot of it at first was fluid, but I think the exercise is helping too. I could lose a few pounds, but take cortisone daily for Rheumatoid Arthritis, so it is always a battle to lose weight. If you are interested in looking at this pretty amazing form of exercise, there are many demonstrations on You Tube, Dr Oz has a good one, but the best way to learn about it is by the books 1 and 2 by Peter Kelder, called the Ancient Secret of the Fountain of Youth. Don't be put off by the title, the exercises are great. I have had some wonderful results since starting. I am only doing 9 reps each morning. It takes no time at all, and the benefits are quite amazing. I suffered from postural vertigo, which is completely gone since shortly after starting these exercises, as well as much more flexibility.

For me, it was a surgery of strange sensations, I had no pain to speak of and the night of my Umx was spent walking the halls of the Hospital, chatting and having coffee with the Nurses. I didn't require any pain meds after the surgery or when I went home.The next morning, my Surgeon and the team arrived, took off the bandages and sent me home. I even talked my Husband into stopping at a mall on the way home, so I could grab a few things. I even bought shoes! My Daughter came to stay for 10 days to help me,which was wonderful, because it was difficult to use my right arm. For me, the recovery was quick, with the exception of the extreme tiredness which could hit me at any time, I could virtually drop off to sleep, mid sentence in the early few weeks. I did do the PT exercises religiously and started to massage my chest to prevent adhesions and to desensitize the skin, which can be uncomfortable from the scraping and the cutting of nerves, during the surgery. All in all, I have to say that as long as you take it easy and listen to your body, nap when you need to, eat really nutritious, drink plenty of water to flush the anesthetic from your body, eat food with enough protein to aid in your healing, you should do really well, so long as there are no unforseen issues. The drains are a nuisance, but they are gone soon enough. I had a couple of hiccups along the way, an infection and a seroma, and cording, but they were fixed relatively quickly without being much more than a nuisance. One tip, if I may, you may think it ridiculous, but for me it really worked at making me good with my decision. The night before my surgery, I had to stay in a Motel close to the Hospital, on my own. My Husband is a C5/6 quadriplegic and we live over an hour from the Hospital, so getting him up and out for a very early start was not an option. I was having trouble sleeping and was very nervous about the SNB, which we have discussed on another thread. I decided to actually speak too my right breast I said \"You've let me down and you have to go!\" weird, yes, but I became calm and managed to sleep. I wish you all the very best for a speedy recovery! Let us know how you're getting on.",

Firstly, Sally is so right, that the majority of biopsies do come back benign and both microcalcifications and macro calcifications are also, very common. It is when these calcifications form a pattern, they become suspicious and a biopsy is necessary. The Biopsy is the only way to get a definitive answer. The biopsy you had was likely a stereotactic core biopsy and it is normal to have from 3 to 8 cores taken for pathology to test. Please try to stay away from Dr Google, it will frighten you, with out of date information. We all know how scary this waiting is, but keeping yourself busy, is the best way to pass the time till you get your results.

It feels like cruel and unusual behavior to us when we have to wait so long for answers. The one thing I can tell you that there is a great positive in all this. Once you have those final results, everything starts to move like it should and time starts to race again. I am amazed that it has been 8 weeks since my surgery. It is just a memory now.

Check out our Dx. When I got the results of my Core Biopsy, I was told that I had a mixture of Grade 2 and 3 DCIS. I read everything I could find on the subject. I recommend Beesie's info on this site for DCIS. The surgeon who gave me my Dx said I should have a Lumpectomy with Rads, that a Mx wasn't required, but the Surgeon I decided to go to, gave me the option of not having Rads, and having a Mx with or without reconstruction. It was a no brainer for me, and I have not looked back. I decided not to reconstruct, and only had a Umx. I feel great, and don't regret it for a second. Would I have left DCIS inside my body, not on your life! and certainly not on mine! LOL Not for one minute more than I had to. As Awmathtchr says, it may well be labeled pre cancer, but it is insidious. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky that I went for that mammo at a new place that had a  new, you beaut, digital machine. The operator had my previous films from the analogue, and said it may well have been there, but they just couldn't see it. I hate to think where I might be if I had gone back to the old place and it was missed again.    Please take another good look at all the data on DCIS, I don't want to scare you, just make sure you are well informed. You'll make the right decision for you. All the very best! I should have mentioned that there are many who have looked at the No Rads with Lumpectomy, and there are threads on this site about that. If you search for it you'll get some insight into that too. Good Luck!",

It is very normal after Mx surgery as we actually have the breast tissue scraped off the back of that area and it leaves it very inflamed. I found that holding the area with my open, flat hand when I was sitting relaxing, helped a lot, as did massage with essential oils, in a carrier oil. My Surgeon suggested touch and massage to help the sensitivity. I found this surgery to be one of many different, strange sensations, some of them I named and they have been discussed on a lot of the threads here. Try drinking something very cold and discover the \"Waterfall\" sensation as it goes down. I had my surgery during the hottest part of the Aussie Summer and on my way home from the Hospital I bought a frozen coke, as a treat because it was near 41c that day, the sensation made me think I was having a heart attack. Many of us have had the same sensation, but no one, has been able to explain it. Then there is another I call \"The Claw\" is happens when you have overdone it, mostly at night and it can only be described like the feeling of a sharp claw holding your chest and underarm. I am pretty sure this one is more to do with the node removal, again, very common. There is also Phantom Itch, which can really be disturbing when you first realize you itch, but there is nowhere to scratch to relieve it. I find rubbing my back with a scratchy towel can relieve it. Again, my Surgeon said it was the nerves that started at the back which were firing off this itch sensation, at the front. Then there is the zinging and zapping of the regenerating nerves, which my Surgeon explained as nerves trying to reconnect and that most of the regeneration is finished in about 12 months after surgry. I have found there hasn't been a lot of improvement in the numbness or the occasional bout of pins and needles once the 12 months had passed. I hope this may help when you feel something that you haven't felt before, just know that it is all normal and many of us have felt the same weird sensations.",

The titanium used in this tiny marker, which is about the size of a sesame seed, is also used in the massive rods, screws and appliances used in surgery all the time. I don't mean to minimize your symptoms in any way, I am sure they are very real, but whether they are caused by the tiny marker is the question. You say you had a \"dangerous allergic reaction\" to a titanium metal patch test, but it was deemed inconclusive, I don't understand how that could be. I can see you are really suffering and feeling terrible stress over this which is obviously fueling the symptoms. I do hope you can find some resolution soon.",

There are a growing number of women arriving on these boards who are opting out of having reconstruction. There are also many of us who are living either flat and fabulous or as a Uni, like me, with just one beast removed, many opt for breast forms, but there are also many who do not. It is absolutely up to the individual. We are also seeing women who are being \"deconstructed\", some of whom were coerced into reconstruction, some who were not really given the option of going flat and still others who really weren't given enough information on the pros and the cons of reconstruction surgery. There are a number of threads here about this very subject and I am sure there will be others along to share their experiences with you. There is breastfree.org, which is a site run by one of our members which has lots of information including pictures of women going flat. There is also Flat and Fabulous on Facebook, many of the women who are on that page are members here too. I would agree with the Mods, if you aren't feeling in synch with your surgeon, can you find another? This is not something to be trifled with and feeling confident with your surgeon is very important. I am in Australia and the figures here with reference to reconstruction appear to be very different to the US, I saw my surgeon a couple of weeks ago for my 2 year check and during the conversation he mentioned that since he has been practicing here in Australia he has done 200 mastectomy surgeries, but only 2 of those women decided to have reconstruction. When I was Dx I knew there was no way I would want reconstruction, it just didn't feel right to me. When I asked my surgeon, just as you did, for a flat straight scar, he said he would do that and that the door was not closed if i ever wanted to change my mind. When I woke after the surgery my surgeon was the first face I saw, he told me \"I did just as you asked, you have a flat, straight scar, I checked it with a spirit level!\" in my drugged state I said \"Wow, really?\" he just laughed and said \"No!\" I actually still ended up with a \"Dog Ear\", my surgeon explained that it is difficult to make it all completely flat, especially when i was a little overweight with a \"D\" cup, unfortunately, not only did I dislike the look of the Dog Ear but mine felt like it had a bundle of cut nerves in it too, so it would zap and zing. I gave it a fair time to see if I could get use dto it, and then decided to have it removed. That was the best thing I have ever done, the difference is amazing. There are pictures of the process on breastfree.org if you are interested to see, before and afters. Please know, you are far from alone, in this decision to not reconstruct. There will always be people who can't understand how we can feel comfortable with this, but that is their issue, their problem, not ours! There has been much debate about this subject and although most agree that a large part of it is financially motivated, it also simply that, unless faced with the decision, no one, not even the surgeons have any idea of how they would react and what they would decide was right for them. I wish you all the very best with your decision and your pending surgery. Please let us know how you get on.",

Are you doing chemo at Peter Mac? I was Dx after a routine Mammo in Bairnsdale just after I moved here, biopsy and Dx in Traralgon at BreastScreen. Found a great Surgeon in Sale who came highly recommended, he did my surgery a few days before Christmas at Sale Hospital. I couldn't recommend my team highly enough. No one could believe I chose to do it here rather than go to Melbourne, but I was so grateful that the newest digital machines were here, and it was because ofthem  that I was diagnosed so early.

I had no problem with seeing it myself, but I was worried about my husband seeing it for the first time. I have to say I don't really know why because he has been a rock for me and has supported  me totally in the decision making process. I opted for the Mx because I would never trust that the sneaky little devil wouldn't come back, and Rads just weren't on my agenda. Reconstruction was never an issue either, he really didn't want me to go through more surgery than I had to, and I didn't want it either . My Mother had a radical Mx without recon too and as Blessings said so beautifully I was used to that scar too. I have never seen the scar as a disfigurement. Not hers or mine. Our situation is a little different too because my husband is a C5/6 Quadraplegic and I am his primary carer. We have attendant care help which has increased since my op. It has been wonderful for me to have the extra help. Although wheelchair bound my husband has always worked, had a business, driven a car and is a champion solo sailor. So a functioning quad who will never be told that he can't do something. Just thought I'd fill you in on that stuff before continuing. As I said, I was a little worried about his reaction to the scar, but he said \"Wow, the will heal really well, and you don't need two boobs to be gorgeous!\" from that moment all was well. I don't even wear a top to bed now because he has made me feel so normal. As you can imagine his disability can make some things a challenge, LOL But since the op he makes sure that he gives my back a rub every night and is always trying to make me comfortable. I think this has actually brought us back to a place we were years ago before things became a tad complacent, as things do, when you've been together a long time. I broached the subject of  the possibility of having the other side go the way of the first. He says that he loved them when I had them, but they never defined me as a woman.",

Often, you will hear of women here who have one removed and keep another for a while longer.  It really depends of the Doctor. I had mine removed at 9 days I think it was, it was under 50ml. They put out less, if you relax and stay quiet, and I admit to remaining fairly sedentary so I could get rid of it. It was a mistake for me really, because I still got a seroma, the ooze still has to go somewhere. I had the seroma, which appeared like the wave of a waterbed across  my chest, drained once and then it just disappeared over time on its own. I guess the only thing you can do is question the nurse to make sure she really thinks it is time for these to come out. Many many women have them pulled early with no bad effects at all. All the best! ",

This is a wonderful place, lots of information and genuine empathy and frienship, you're not alone now. So you have had a Mammo and because of what was seen, you are going to have a biopsy. That's a good thing, because there is no other way to know what is going on in there, but the good news is, 80% of these things turn out to be benign. I am so pleased to hear that you have someone to go with you next week. It is always a good thing if you can have someone else to be another set of ears. We can miss alot of what we are being told in these stressful situations. All I heard was Blah, Blah, Blah, LOL Lucky I had my husband to decipher for me. Try not to overthink this, and please don't google, just stick around here and ask us questions. You will get more information next week, try writing down the questions you have for the surgeon, and don't be afraid of the biopsy, you'll be fine.  I know it is a very scary thing and the fear of the unknown is a dreadful thing. We all understand how you feel. I have said before, if I knew then what I know now, I would have done the waiting differently. I would have taken better care of myself, and tried to get more rest, because the stressing doesn't change the outcome, it just robs you of time you could have spent far more efficiently. Hindsight is a wonderful thing Mith! You take care, come here often and let us know how you are doing. There will be others along soon to chat too!       ",

I too have an aversion to anaesthetic, a nesessary evil! As to your question, I would imagine the visit to the Oncologist should really be decided by the results of the biopsy, and your surgeon. If it were me, I would want all the information together, and then speak to the Surgeon and the Oncologist about their recommendations. I'd then make a decision. I was fortunate, when I got my final pathology after my Mx, there weren't any \"extra surprises\" it was just as the mammo had predicted. My surgeon explained to me, that in my situation, with my diagnosis, there is controvery over taking Tamox. That was all I needed to hear, I rejected it because I was afraid of the  SE's. Now that isn't to say, had I been given a really compelling reason to take it, I would have made the same decision. Try not to race too far ahead, you aren't dignosed yet, and have every chance of getting a B9 result from this biopsy, You have had  a rough time, and you are still healing from your previous surgery. Take it one step at a time I know it is overwhelming, but Friday will be here before you know it, then not too long after you'll have more information so you can make any decisions that may be necessary with a clear view of what is going on. I am sure there wil be others along that will give you more insightful advice because they have been in the same situation, and are your age. For now, try to relax, and please don't google, that will just confuse you more. Take care, and let us know how you are doing.",

He says he wants to deal with it in his own time which may have been ok in the beginning, but as so much time has passed with no resolution you're both stuck in this awful place. Is there no way you can gently suggest some help might be beneficial for both of you, or has he firmly shut the door on that possibility? Please don't think I am being a busybody. I just feel so bad for you being in this lonely place after all you've endured, and as you say you've survived this journey this should be a postive time for you both. I am so sorrry he can't get passed this. I can understand you not wanting to subject yourself to more surgery, I doubt I'd want to go down that road either. I know I will probably get in trouble for this, so I'll apologise first, I know this is not my business but here goes. One side of me wants to say he needs a slap on the back of the head and told to \"get with it!\" I am so sorry if this upsets you. Just tell me to back off, I'll understand. I would really like to say to him. \"Look what this wonderful woman has suffered and here she is, on the other side, as strong and as passionate as before, still so in love with you, and ready to resume where she left off before her life was interrupted by this dark passenger hitching a ride!\" \"It can be as it was, it really can!\" \"It can actually be better!\" Again, I am so sorry that you are feeling this way, hope i haven't offfended you. I hope there is something you can do to resolve this because it sounds like you have had a wonderful relationship in the past, and we all know how rare that is these days.

When I told him of my decision, he explained how he does the incision and I told him I wanted a straight flat scar. I did have somewhat of a \"DogEar\" after the surgery, which I don't blame him for, but I had that revised, after the first year. My scar was exactly what I asked for, he even continued the scar slightly across onto my other breast and explained that I had some sun damage on my chest that he was able to repair with the extending of the scar. I couldn't have been happier with that, as I did have a little puckering from a lifetime of sun worshiping and now it is flat and smooth. Just a small bonus! LOL I searched all over the internet for pictures, when I decided I wasn't having a reconstruction, but apart from Breastfree and the Scar Project, I didn't find much at all. As we all know,there are a huge amount of recon pics, but I guess there are only so many ways to present a non recon chest. I will ask the girls in my group, but I doubt there will be any websites with pictures. I will let you know if I find any sites for you to look at.",

The oils that I use are an analgesic blend, very soothing, the analgesic blend is called Be Relieved, which I have used for many years, because I also have Rheumatoid Arthritis. I get them through a company here in Australia called aroma.com.au I would imagine there would be something similar where you are. I find them relaxing and definitely better for me, than taking meds, which I usually have some kind of reaction to. The essential oils are antibacterial and antiviral too and the carrier oils are wheatgerm, macadamia and sweet almond.",

I remember being a new Mum and having a bad result from my pap smear and having to have surgery. I was literally a \"hormone with feet\". I remember the fear like it was yesterday, in reality it was 35 years ago. As to your Doctor, it is awful when your requests go unanswered. We all need to know our Doctors are there for us.  If you feel the need to see someone else then that is totally your choice.  As to all the symptoms you are feeling, the stress is definitely a contributor to all this and if you've got a yeast infection too, then it isn't surprising that you feel really off your game. If it were me, I would go to the clinic if only to have that treated. Do you have a GP? Maybe a sit down and talk with a Doctor would help with everything you're feeling. I feel for you, and I know that everyone here will want to help you in any way they can to allay your fears. As most of us have said, the fear and the waiting is the worst part of this journey. Once you know what the diagnosis is, and what the treatment will be, you are in more control. As to the surgery itself, you're in a good head place. It really isn't bad, I was so surprised at how quickly I was up and out and back to normal after it. As to your final paragraph, I can feel your fear. Stress is a brutal thing that can manifest in so many scary ways. You don't have to ask if you are overreacting, anything goes here, and we all understand how overwhelming this can feel. You don't need a slap in the face or a dunk in a cold river lovely one, you need the support that we will all give you through this.  Ask anything, there will be someone nearby who has experienced what you are going through. I wish I could give you a hug!",

You've got this far, the surgery will be over in no time. I found that I started to relax when I got to the Hospital and had the tracer. I felt a great load lift off me, knew I was in good hands and that all would be fine, and it so was! I wish the same for you and all the others going in tomorrow. Positive thoughts and gentle hugs!

I have been doing it religiously at least twice a day every day. The woman who owns the company where I buy the oils advised me that pure Lavander Oil is really great for the actual incision. I didn't bother about using it on its own as the blend I use has it in it too. I got a slight infection in the wound, about 2cm, but I believe that this was what saved me from it being much worse. I also got Cording, and I massaged them with it too. I am now 8 weeks out and they are all gone too.",

Not all because of infection, but enough to make you think about how many of these super bugs are actually around and causing havoc. I am certainly no expert in this area, but I don't think the incisions are too large for removal of implants. That's not to say that it won't be uncomfortable.  I am not sure about drains. I am sure someone will be along soon who can advise. My first thoughts about what will be comfortable for you for work, would be leaning toward a cami, or tank with a \"softee\" inside you can stitch a softee into a cami with a shelf bra inside. You will have your arms raised a lot and if you just stuff a Genie, I think you may have the issue of it riding up because there isn't any weight inside it. At least with a tank or cami, you can tuck them in to a skirt or pants and you won't have any issue of a bra band around your chest to irritate. Some people are using small weights inside a softee or a micro bead foob, to hold them, and the bra in place. Some use small fishing weights or birdseed, or rice. I haven't tried any of these, but my silly side has me picturing Tippy Hedron in The Birds being chased down the street with Blackbirds attacking her chest! LOL Another possibility would be one of the Post Surgery camis that come with its own softees, again, something that will stay down and not keep riding up. There is a foam, weighted form available, which I have and wear regularly inside a crop top active wear sports bra. It is called \"Truelife\" weighted foam. It is very comfortable without the extra weight of a silicone Prosthesis. I sure hope you find something that will be comfortable for you while you wait to have your recon redone.  I hope something here may be of help to you, the Flat and Fabulous girls may have more ideas too. Take care, I wish you all the very best. M x",

What it did for us, was wake us up from a complacency that had taken over, slowly but surely in the past few years. We are both in our late 50's, so older than a lot  of you here, which can obviously make a difference too. Suddenly, we had to act as a team, make the big decisions and wait for the final outcome. He was a rock for me. He came to every appointment, and researched everything.  By the time the surgery was over and there weren't any nasty surprises from the Pathology, we felt closer than we'd been in ages. Don't get me wrong, we weren't having problems before, just as I said, a bit complacent. The overwhelming relief was like a tonic for us both. I had bought lots of pyjamas, something I'd never worn before, because I assumed that would be how life would be now. I haven't had them on since the drain was removed on day 6. It has been 8 weeks and there are no reservations about being naked, with the light on, in front of him. We have even reached the stage of being able to joke about it. As  mentioned in an earlier post, I was a bit nervous about him seeing me for the first time, I really don't know why, he looked at the scar and said \"Wow, that will heal beautifully, and You don't need two boobs to be gorgeous!\" That was a defining moment for me, just as I had had another defining moment the night before my surgery, just a couple of nights before. I had disconnected from my breast by actually saying to it \"You've let me down, you have to go!\" As silly as it sounds, it worked for me. We seem to have a new lease on life, it is hard to explain, but for us this new \"normal\" is good. I guess I should also say that our situation is a little different. I don't really know if this the reason that I don't have those feelings of loss that so many others feel, or if in fact it is the reason he is so accepting and unaffected by the change in my body. My husband broke his neck in a hang gliding accident 35 years ago. He is a quadraplegic who uses a manual wheelchair. His new kind of \"Normal\" came when he was 4 months short of his 21st Birthday. He is an inspiration. I met him much later, after he'd been married and divorced. That was 15 years ago. His disability was never an issue for me. There was no insurance, so he has had to battle for everything. He managed to teach himself how to drive again, he had to look for a new career because his lack of manual dexterity precluded him from continuing in Micro Biology Physiology. He got another degree, has worked constantly since his accident. Took up snow skiing, water skiing and came second in the World championships for disabled sailing 2005. Has designed our last home from the ground up, and designed the renovations for the new house we are in now.  I have always said, if he were on two legs, I'd never keep up with him. I could go on and on with his achievements. We had just moved here when I was diagnosed, after a year of selling, buying renovating and commuting 3 1/2 hours each way every fortnight to oversee the work.  We had retired early from full time employment, but have a small business that we run from home. This was to be our dream home on the lake, our escape from the big city to a quieter space, and a slower pace. That's exactly what it is.",

They attach you to that machine by the offending breast in the paddles, they tape your arm to your side so it can't move.

I know it feels a bit weird, but really, you've found yourself in a really supportive environment here you can ask anything. We have all been where you are now. So glad you are feeling a bit more comfortable now, there really are, so many of us around. I belong to a BC support group in my little coastal town and of the 23 members, there is only 1 who has reconstructed. She is very happy with it and I am pleased for her. I don't have anything against recon and if that is what a woman wants, all power to her. I just object to being defined as \"unwomanly\" because I have only one breast. It sure hasn't changed the way I feel about myself and if it bothers someone else, that's their problem. I may be wrong, but I doubt you will find what you are seeking in a google search. I believe it will be by approaching a breast surgeon directly, that you'll find out if they are willing to perform the surgery you want. Let us know how you're getting on.",

I understood that it would be difficult to get it completely flat and straight I am and was a D, so there was a fair weight to pull that forward. I went back to my Surgeon about 15 months after my Mx and had the revision done with a local anesthetic, in his office. For me, it was the best decision ever. I no longer have a shelf under my arm and best of all the cut nerve sensation of zapping and zinging is gone.",

I feel great, just a bit bruised, but no pain, and the Sentinal Node tracer that I was terrified of was a non event for me. It truly didn't hurt a bit. I will be 60 next birthday, and really thought I would have a hard time because I am not the fittest person, I have rheumatoid arthritis. I have only one, albeit a stonking big drain in, but it isn't putting out much so I have been told that my Surgeon will call me in a few days and meet me back at his office, which is already closed for the holidays, to remove it asap. I have to tell you all that the waiting was by far the worst part of this, it was brutal. The surgery is so refined now that the recovery is fast. The anaesthetics are brilliant, and my scar is neat and will fade in time. I am not going to reconstruct at this time. I was wide awake within a couple of hours, eating a meal and calling friends and family. I know it is hard to believe that this surgery will be a thing of the past very soon for each of you.

I am sorry to say, I think she is scared that something is going to come between you and her.  Fear is a terribly destructive emotion, and people react in very different ways to it. Has she been there, or is this her own fear of what happens that she has thrown at you? I had people tell me that the surgery was going to be horrific, and that the sentinal node biopsy tracer was the  worst thing you could ever experience. I am usually a very positive motivated person, but all this negativity really got me down. I was consumed by fear for a month before my surgery. I truly can't understand what people get out of passing on this negativity. I'd rather say nothing than frighten someone about to embark on this journey. When I found this site I got great advice and empathy from the others that had gone before me. Now I can pass on my experience to others in a positive way. When my surgeon came to see me yesterday morning he said \"go home you're doing really well, don't be an invalid and take to your bed, do what you can, but don't overdo it.\" That was just 16 hours after I returned from surgery. I have had no problem showering, washing my hair, doing my makeup, making a meal, tidying up. I have done my arm exercises which I will be doing religiously, I don't want any shoulder restrictions, or the dreaded LE. Sure there will be some restrictions for a short while, but that's all it will be. You will be Tattooing, doing hair and lifting your daughter in no time. This kind of surgery is so refined now. I can't speak for the Chemo, but there are many others here who can tell you all about that too. Try not to engage in the negative stuff, just know that you will come out the other side of this and the fear will have been for nothing. I'd love to hear about your tattooing, I am assuming it is cosmetic tattooing, or are you a tattoo artist? I am considering doing some ink on my chest later on. Take care!",

I am no expert on Dx, my only reason to ask you is because DCIS by its very nature is confined to the milk ducts and only when it has broken through and morphed into IDC, the Dx of DCIS becomes somewhat redundant and there is a new Dx. DCIS never requires chemo because it is stage 0 and therefore classified as pre cancer, which was definitely mentioned in your original report, but it seems you had another tumor, and perhaps were  supposed to have a SNB, or Sentinel node biopsy which failed during your Mx surgery. The only reason I asked, is because we get a lot of new members who are Dx with DCIS, I was one, just a year ago, who are told there is no Chemo, only Rads if they opt for a Lumpectomy, or occasionally if they are found to require it after a Mx. To then see your Dx as DCIS with chemo and full axillary section can be confusing. Your story is a very different one. I am glad to see that everything is going well for you now. Take care, and thank you so much for the explanation!     ",

I was a little hesitant to show my husband my wound on Thursday, but he just looked at it and said \"Wow! that will heal really well, and you don't need two boobs to be gorgeous!\" He's a keeper! I wish you all the very best for your surgery, and don't hesitate to ask anything you need to on here. Mirmirpanda, I am very interested in looking at having a tattoo over the area too. I have seen a few on line that are interesting. Do you know of any sites that are worth looking at? I worked in the beauty business for many years, and loved it too. I have always had a fascination for beautiful tattoos, and had my first, and only when I turned 40. Never thought I'd have another, but maybe! JMRH I hope you are both on the mend. Sorry to hear you've been unwell. mrenee, good luck for everything on the 23rd, you have a great attitude! WOW, that is tomorrow. You'll be just fine! It will be all over before you know it! Please let us know how you are. Hopex3, I know what you mean about the missing friends. Most of mine have been amazing, but a few, well, I am hoping it is just the time of year. Natsfan, wise words from you. Thank you! Grateful that you are taking the time to help all of us newbies! Mariposa and Destina, how areyou doing? Please let us know how you are doing. I have had a quiet day today, can't believe my surgery was just three days ago. All is going well, and still no pain to speak of, just a little tired today, but so glad to be over this hurdle. Take care everyone!  ",

I went back in and had another scan, still not showing the node, back again for more massage, I think there was one more lot of massage and finally it showed up in the scan. I was talking with the operator the whole time, and he told me that some people have no problem with the tracer, where in others it  doesn't show up easily. I know it is really hard, but try not to freak out and start worrying again you need to start healing. One step at a time. There is nothing definite here, waiting for the Pathology results is just another step in this awful process. You will likely see the Surgeon again soon, ask her for a better explanation about her statement. Try to focus on the positive, you are through the surgery and doing well. The next part will happen in due course, we are all here for you, keep us informed.",

It is so unfair that we have to endure this, but if we can help another along the way it makes it a little easier for us all. I am humbled by the strength of the women who have gone before us with far worse diagnosis than mine. They take the time to take us by the hand and show us the way so we can do the same for others. It is a very uplifting experience. I read a lovely quote yesterday: We are each of us Angels with only one wing. We can only fly by embracing each other! Luciano de Crescento.",

I bought some wide ribbon and made a long loop that went around my neck. The drains had little plastic pegs on them, so I just pegged them to the fromt of me with a baggy shirt over them. When I left the Hospital I only had one drain, but it was a huge concertina type bulb. I simply put it in a cloth shopping bag that I wore as a shoulder bag. No problems at all.  I don't know if it helps when I say, I had a right Mx and sentinel node biopsy. I had almost total arm movement, so no problem at the bathroom or anything else with that arm. Everyone is different, and I am sure someone that had the same surgery will come along and let you know of their experience. Try not to worry too much as the surgery approaches, easier said than done, I know, but it really isn't ever as bad as our poor tired scared brains try to trick us into believing. Take care and we will be here to welcome you over to this side of the experience soon.",

I know it is hard to stay focused and not let your fear take over, but you will know what is going on soon. My very best wishes and positive thoughts are with you.

I told him that I had asked this question on a Forum and had heard from many people who have the same sensation after Mx.  A few people on another thread got back to me and said that it disappeared after about six months. They just didn't notice it any more. So there is light at the end of the tunnel! I think that there are going to be many subtle changes, it is early days for all of us here. This has been a huge time of adjustment. As much as the time seemed to drag while we were waiting for results, and then for Surgery, now that we are on the other side of that debilitating stress we are still feeling its effects as we heal and get used to where we are now.

I was in touch with my local one just prior to surgery and she was a great source of info for me. Unfortunately because my op was so close to Christmas, and all the offices were closing, I didn't have any contact with her after I came out of Hospital, but the District Nurses who came to do my drains were fantastic, and really switched on about what was happening . I was one that had all the pre op appointments, but I had never experienced that before in Hospitals in Melbourne. Even friends that had the same surgery as I just had in the Melbourne private system didn't have the appointments that I had. I think it must just be certain Hospitals do this, I believe quite new, system.  They were also obsessed with getting the details right. I went through probably a half dozen different people who all wanted me to repeat my name and birthdate, and tell them, and point to which side they were going to do. I also had two people draw on me with a texta to make sure it was the right side. Not complaining, just stating what happened at this regional public Hospital. I do wish you all the very best Jebdra, and Auntie Em! Try to keep the nerves under control, I know it is hard, I am the worst one to talk, I was terrified.

I know that I had Morphine after my surgery because it is Pethedine that makes me nauseous, and the Surgeon told me that they fill the wound with anti-infammatory medication and give you anti nausea before you leave the theatre. I didn't have any painkillers after the surgery except for the 4 Panadol I took the next day for my poor broken toe. They gave me Oxycodone, Panadol and Anti Nausea medication to take home but I didn't open any of them. I didn't have any reconstruction though,so it may be different for those who are having that done. One thing I meant to mention to all of those going in for the surgery, if you can get some throat lozenges, take them with you. I hate the feeling of the anaesthetic throat lozenges so they had to send out for some that were just medicated for me. My throat was sore for a few hours till the lozenges kicked in. i",

So glad to see you're nearly at the end of the chemo, but so sad to see that you're recon hasn't turned out to be as you would have wanted it. it must be so frustrating after going through all that surgery. I have just been to my first follow up since Mx, all is well, I can't believe how fast the time has gone. I wish you all the best, and hope that the breast improves. Maybe some more time will make a difference? I know from my own experience, of no recon, my chest has continued to change over time and seems to have reached the point where it has no more swelling, and the scar is fading. I am building a bit of chest muscle with yoga exercises, so I don't have such a cave in, and a bra sits more firmly against my chest. I think this is as good as I am going to get. I would still love to tattoo over the site, but have been scared off by too many stories of LE. Maybe later! So pleased to see you.. How's that gorgeous Hazel? and Chris?   take care ((HUGS)))",

Another interesting one is, when I am sitting watching TV, I can feel the non existent breast resting in the same position as the other one. I also often get a nipple sensation for no reason at all. My Surgeon called it Phantom Sensation, just like amputees can get. Thankfully, not pain like a friend with only one arm describes.

Mine would actually move like a wave, and the underarm area was numbness, tingling, burning, and strange feeling. I am now 5 weeks from Mx and the underarm is getting back to normal. Only a bother if I wear something that rubs on it. My Surgeon decided to drain the fluid from under my incision because he said the skin wasn't attaching to the chest wall as it should. I didn't feel a thing, and now it is nice and flat. Just out of interest Janice, do you have soreness below your ribs too. I had a lot of discomfort where the drain exited, and my ribs were really sore too. I discovered I had Mondors Cording which was causing that pain. My Surgeon is not at all concerned, said it will resolve itself. I was told to do the exercise religiously, but not to reach over my head till the drain was removed. Mine came out after 5 days, so I have been exercising for 4 weeks now and have total range of movement. In Australia it is when the output is below 50mm that they remove them. Smethot, I love reading your posts. It is great to have a laugh about this! I'm not sure if i posted here, but we have been having a really hot summer. I don't use talcum because of the ovarian cancer connection, but I needed something to help with the sticky feeling under my arm. I bought a box of Cornflour and apply that with a big fluffy makeup brush. It helps with the perspiration, but moreso with the skin rubbing and feeling really uncomfortable and strange. You could put a couple of drops of essential oils in it if you want some fragrance. I haven't noticed any odour at all from my underarm.",

I feel it too, and have had a very similar experience in my emotions since my DCIS diagnosis in November, and surgery a few days before Christmas. I too have a husband with a disability, he's a C5/6 quad after a Hang Gliding accident 35 years ago. My recovery has been very similar to yours, I am almost 60 and already retired, so I don't work any more. I am my Husband's primary carer. My days are filled with whatever I want to do. I joke that I don't know how I had time to go to work. It may interest you that I had a UMX, and no reconstruction and I am really happy with my decision. Do I feel disfigured? No I really don't. Different? Yes, this is my new \"Normal\" and I have no problem with it. I believe when I detached from my breast the night before surgery I had what I call a \"Breakthrough, not a Breakdown!\" As silly as it may sound I actually spoke to my right breast, I told it \"You've let me down, you have to go!\" I felt calmer from that moment. It wouldn't work for everyone, but It put me in a different place. My scar is healing well, I massage it with aromathereapy oils every day and because it is summer here in Australia, I expose it to the sun for about 15 minutes a day to give it some bacteria busting UV's.   A week ago I went and got fitted for a prosthesis, and some really beautiful bras and lingerie, so I feel confident when I am out, and have no problem going bra-less at home.   Life as a Uniboober is just fine! There is a thread about the Emotional side of DCIS and MX on this site that you may be interested in.",

It was a strange sensation which kind of felt like the liquid was filling the area that had been removed. I asked my Surgeon about it and he said there was no way that there was any correllation between the surgery and the gullett. I personally believe it was to do with the insulation of the breast being gone. It lasted for about 6 weeks and then like so many of the other strange sensations of this surgery, it just seemed to fade. If I concentrate on it when I take a hot or cold drink I can still feel it, but I think the body has just become used to it and it doesn't bother me any more. There were a good number of us here who experienced it. I can't speak for the bad taste you are having, but I did have the nausea and queasy feeling for some time. I have always had, and been medicated for heartburn and sliding Hiatus Hernia, so I put it down to the anaesthetic and the Reflux.  I hope you feel better, you're surgery was a few weeks after mine, so I don't think it is unusual to still be feeling those strange effects. I would love to hear what a GI Doc thnks about it. Good Luck!",

I wish you all the very best, for a full recovery from your nerve pain. I haven't had the pain you've experienced, but have had strange sensations caused by the nerve regeneration. I am 15 months out now and happy to say they have lessened so much, that what is left is very manageable. I recently had a revision of my \"Dog Ear\" and that made a huge difference. I always felt like there was a little bunch of cut nerves in that flesh  which would zing when it was being restricted by the side of my bra. It is now flat and numb like the rest of the incision.
