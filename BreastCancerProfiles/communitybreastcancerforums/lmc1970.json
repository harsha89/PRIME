I do think now they check the sentinal node where as back then, even though it was only 4 years ago, they didn't. They didn't even use the words TNBC back then either....so many years ago lol",

Last year they found 15/23 cancerous lymph nodes in my left axilla. I chose only surgery and prayed like crazy it wouldn't come back. Unfortuantely this year I found one of my supraclavicular nodes had swollen to 2cm. That CT showed nothing else....or so I thought. A CT scan taken two weeks later showed a 5cm tumor in my axilla. How the flip did they miss that??? So grumpy...anyway I am on chemo now. 6 lots of Abraxane have shrunk the node but not touched the tumor-makes my mind boggle how that happens! So now I have to try another chemo-A/C. Will be trying that in a couple of weeks....any advice would be greatly appreciated! xoxo",

They wanted the pagans to join their church so they offered to incorporate their festivals into church life....so Dec 25 had nothing to do with Jesus-it's the date of a pagan festival. The trees, presents etc have pagan origins and Christians just embrace it...IMO I don't think God would be pleased to see pagan symbols in the church today...but that's just how I feel and so I don't celebrate Christmas. Mom3 is it the part in the bible that says not to mark days the reason why you don't celebrate Christmas, Easter etc?",

Too many times we don't look to what offends our God and do what we think is ok. I don't ever want to pick and choose the bits of the Bible I want to follow-I want to follow it all.

Are we ever allowed to say anything on this site without being ridiculed or told we are wrong? If you celebrate Christmas-good for you. I don't-I believe with all my heart the bible tells us not to. I also believe that if God wanted us to celebrate this day He would have told us to in the bible-after all he tells us how to live our lives in every other way. It's got nothing to with me not having faith. I'm not meant to have faith for Christmas....Anyway I have expressed how I feel and if that makes me self-righteous and overjudgemental then so be it. It was only a matter of time before the name calling started. BTW sharing your opinion doesn't mean you are judging others. If you are feeling judged, there may be other reason for it.",

I didn't go on a \"Why Christmas is Great\" forum and start telling everyone they were wrong and nor would I. I could sit here and call you names and go through your posts and tell you where you are scripturally wrong but I just don't care enough about this issue nor have I come on here to tell people they are wrong. Again, I was sharing what I believe to be true just like you have shared.I was foolish to think I could speak freely here- But sure-after you have called me names and told me I started the redicule and negative comments, I will find it very easy to get along with you..... PS this was a forum for those who don't celebrate Christmas (or so I thought)...I thought it would be a safe place to share my beliefs with others that feel the same way I do. I was wrong.",
