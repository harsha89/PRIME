      "Content": "AnnAlive wrote: I'm in neoadjuvant chemo, having completed 4 DD A/C and 7 of 12 weekly Taxol/Herceptin. So far it seems the chemo has been working because the tumor in the left breast is no longer palpable and the axillary lymph node tumor that was extracapsular has become tiny. At this week's onco appointment, she noted that the thickened breast skin (malignant in punch biopsies) has gradually cleared on the inner side of the breast (mainly during A/C I think), but the thickened skin on the outer side and near areola is not clearing, and is now thicker. She looked displeased or concerned, but before I could think to ask what that means for me, she was on to checking the lymph nodes. I usually have a number of questions I want to ask at these appointments, and if there is something unexpected (while DH is busy taking notes), I lose my presence of mind to follow up what was just said! I couldn't find any other discussion on this specific topic--What does it mean if the skin starts to further thicken? Is it no longer responding to chemo and is there more cancer growth, or can it change while healing? (I realize the goal is not to make the skin beautiful - ha - but to observe that neoadjuvant chemo is reducing the evidence. I'll have a BMX in a few weeks, so that skin will be gone, but meanwhile is the tumor trying to metastasize?) I may be obsessing a little too much on this because of steroid episodes. On Decadron pre-med, I have been flying high with energy initially, and then toward the next treatment, I have been a mess of tears, anger, and depression -- worsening for the last few Taxol cycles. My onco agreed to reduce Decadron from 10mg to 4mg, and started me on daily Ativan, which I resisted (yet another drug) but she said it was necessary if I was to have less steroids. Well, I didn't have energy after this IV Decadron at 4mg and I'm feeling kind of lethargic and achy, so I'll see how I adjust to this. I see that others have posted about steroid psychosis. I didn't expect to become so emotional about just about anything. AnnAlive - 2011: AC/TH, BMX, ALND, TEs. 2012: Rads, DIEP. 2014: LE.

Nobody mentioned the possibility of ILC (since the pathology report said IDC), but it is a curious thing why the remaining thickened skin (located closer to the tumor) seems to be getting worse -- thicker -- while on chemo. True that surgery should answer my questions!  clariceak: You are right about Decadron, confirmed on other threads and also one of my chemo nurses said it leads some to steroid psychosis while they are taking it. I felt like I was on my way there, and now, almost a week later on less Decadron and with Ativan added, I am feeling more \"even-tempered\" -- less crazy.",

I'm already getting the works: almost through chemo AC -TH (proceeding to at least a year of H), followed by BMX & axillary node dissection, then 6-7 wks rads. I'm unclear on whether it is possible to know, after neoadjuvant chemo, how many nodes had been positive (in addition to any that are still positive at surgery). My scans showed many enlarged axillary nodes, but only one was biopsied and was positive, with extracapsular extension. Will I know what the \"real\" positive node count is from before chemo? Seems like no one has mentioned having an issue with skin involvment that may be thickening/growing during chemo. I wonder if it is an ominous sign, or has been IBC all along, ominous enough, but not sure what would be done differently for it with another opinion.",

Diana, I'm praying for a good PET scan for you -- no spot on the chest wall! I hope you can get immediate recon. I was told earlier that they wouldn't do reconstruction because of the radiation, but they changed their minds because some are successful, including a friend of mine. My ONC said only 30% with my similar diagnosis achieve complete pathological response from chemo. With chemo to be finished on Monday, I don't think I reached it, with some skin involvement still evident (although I don't know if it's still positive) and the largest lymph node is still palpable. The tumor has shrunk. But without any scans, how do I know if anything else is going on that would postpone TEs?

I said in my previous post 3 days ago that I'd report back what my PS said about my TE infection -- well, I ended up in the hospital right after my PS appointment, with an abscess under my incision. Obviously, the antibiotics weren't working! My PS did surgery to remove the TE, thoroughly clean out the area, and put in a new TE. I'm on two IV antibiotics -- started at the hospital, and now that I just got home, I'll have home care teach me (I'm an ex-nurse) how to give them myself in the port. They are coming tonight for the next dose! My PS is also consulting with an infectious disease specialist to handle to antibiotic choices. Lots of blood work results (like cultures) pending to be sure I'm on the right stuff. The brand new TE is bending, filled only to 200 cc, half what I had in the one PS removed. This is causing some pain, and when he saw it on rounds this morning, said he may have to do an early fill to relieve this. It's upsetting to start out with this complication when this is supposed to be part of the repair. But more important is to get rid of this infection! I wrote some more about this on the TE Trouble thread in the Breast Reconstruction forum. iLUV2knit - my pink skin was irregular on a couple of areas over the TE. Nothing with a white center, but a puffiness in some areas, and then I developed thinning over the incision -- it could have opened up soon, and it had been fairly well healed (I'm at 7 weeks post-BMX). I had a low-grade fever, but I have that anyway sometimes while taking Herceptin. I think for sure that you need to see your doctor because the pink area and fever are worrisome! You want to try to save that TE! I hope my replaced one gets to stay. I had a 10-day course of oral antibiotics to clear the first pink skin episode, then a fill, and then 2 days later the pink skin returned and I started another 10-day course of the same antibiotics. I only got to day 7 when I happened to have an appointment with the PS, and was sent to the hospital. I'm thinking he should have changed antibiotics or done surgery a week earlier to see what was going on -- to get cultures, etc.  I encourage you to get attention on this -- darn, it's the weekend now! Call anyway!",

It's so good you are progressing through all this, and maybe you can advise those of us with upcoming BMX / TEs. Diana --  About ONC not ordering scans before BMX. She said they will do them if there are symptoms. Because my tumor seems to be responding to chemo, I suppose they proceed with surgery and rads as planned. But what about if there is any cancer in the chest wall now (I already have it in the skin). Is it discovered at surgery, and would it rule out getting TEs? I see my PS next week, so may ask about that. Praying for your PET scan for next week. Tell us how it goes and if you get your immediate recon. Ah2bthin --  My BS said BMX is a personal decision, and that prophylactic on my non-cancer side is not necessary oncologically. I decided on it because of my stage, for symmetry with reconstruction, and because I have had suspicious calcifications leading to biopsies (benign) on that breast twice in the last 8 years, so I'd anticipate having mammograms and biopsies whenever anything looks suspicious again, so I'd like to avoid that.  Rachelvk -- Do you have a surgery date or is 4 weeks their best guess for now?  Best wishes deciding on what kind of recon. This morning is IT -- last chemo! Woo hoo! I hope weekly Herceptin after this is easier, but it will be hard to notice with surgery and rads going on too! I think the Herceptin continues straight through, except surgery week.",

Does that sound like a B-cup with allowance for shrinkage during rads? Does it sound like a lot of filling in a short time that will be very uncomfortable?

My BS took sample(s) to test immediately during surgery to see if my formerly cancerous breast skin had resolved with chemo. Apparently it is good now, at least the part she took to biopsy. Of course, all of the breast and skin tissue will be analyzed, taking 1-2 weeks to get the pathology report. She took all of my 1st & 2nd level axillary nodes on the left side, but only checked the 3rd level and said those look fine. I think she does expect many 1st & 2nd level to be positive. What I'm not sure about is if they can tell the nodes HAD been positive and no longer are, due to chemo, or if they count only currently positive nodes that did not respond to chemo. Anyone know this? This Nucynta I'm taking for pain is really strong -- makes me a little dizzy and then I fall asleep. I'm taking it every 4 hours to start, even though the label says 4-6 hours. My chest is feeling sorer, and I need help getting off the bed or sofa. I've lost my appetite (which never happened during chemo) -- probably due to the various drugs.",

The wig is Rene of Paris - Noriko brand, the Cory model, in Marble-Brown (easy to look up online). It is synthetic and short for the Florida summer (or year-round) and has elastic adjustment straps to change the size. Cost $120 at Bella Vista Spa (right behind Center for Cancer Care), but my insurance reimbursed it. A stylist buzzed my head and shaped up the wig. I see it online for that price too. I had never worn a wig, but it has served me well, and I found I prefer to wear it in public rather than scarves and hats. My own hair is growing in so slowly due to Herceptin infusions that I expect to use the wig at least through this summer. I also bought 2 scarves at Bella Vista Spa that I really like and wore in the hospital and around the house. They have a shaped cap with tails that tie in the back. I don't wear any head cover at home now because my hair is growing in, but I still don't like how short it is for going out. You'll be surprised how cool your head feels without hair -- I also wore a knit cap around the house and to sleep in the winter.

Well, I could hardly walk out of the PS office (with DH help) and we went on to my first (still morning) appointment with the RO (to get ready for rads next month). In talking to the check-in nurse, I asked if this was just a talking consultation or an examination too, and she said there would be an exam. Oh no! I was in so much pain, I said I'd have to reschedule, and then we went home so I could rest this pain with meds. Not a good idea--should have returned to the PS. By 7:30pm I was in such pain that I called the PS's cell phone number and had to meet him at the office to have 50 cc removed from the left TE. That was night before last and it has been OK since, although I have continued to be on pain meds every 4 hours except for sleeping through the night. Has anyone else had such trouble with the amount of fill? Now I am at Left 250 cc and Right 300 cc. I can get fills each week up until rads start, which may be in about 4 weeks.

She was ecstatic about the results! Negative for residual carcinoma in the breasts and 19 nodes dissected. One or more of those nodes had been cancerous before, and this report refers back to the previous biopsy. This pathology report doesn't specify a stage, but the Onc said I am considered in remission now, with prognosis improved -- to be vigilant for 5 years, and recurrence reduced to 10%. Woo hoo! I will of course have to have rads and continue Herceptin. Meanwhile, there is recovery from the BMX with TEs and node incision. That long axillary incision is stiff and burning, making it hard to move my arm. I wasn't given specific exercises by either surgeon, so I am using something I found from Sloan Kettering, including shoulder rolls, arm circles, and \"make wings.\" When is it safe to raise arms above the head and not mess up the TEs or strain the axillary incision?",

Answer was Yes, that there is no photosensitivity to the rest of the body due to radiation therapy, so sun exposure to the rest of the body is fine.

It's probably best to be shown the technique by a physical therapist. ",

It seeems to me they will have enough film records to recreate it if needed!  Maureen - I'm more like \"annoyed\" with the look of the tattoos than \"upset.\" After all, compared to the current look of my lopsided chest after the failed TE, the tats are just specks. They just add to the disguise I have to put on before going out in public. Of course, I'll have no disguise on the tattoos (no makeup) when I go for rads. Kaara - I think the total rad dosage is calculated based on what the RO thinks you need, and divided into the many doses over 7 weeks so your body and skin can tolerate them. Stopping mid-way would mean you aren't getting their therapeutic total. The alternatives are interesting, though, and I hope you find one that's good for you. It's hard to know what to ask for when the options aren't presented. I have doubts too, but figure with my stage and grade, they are throwing everything at me to help prevent recurrence. Ossa - The first planning appointment consists of positioning, possibly creation of a custom mold (mine holds my left arm over my head, and my head is turned to the right to keep my chin out of the field), markings (I got 2 Xs marks with clear stickers, replaced by tattoos at dry run), temporary wires taped on to mark areas for the scan (they marked my drain scars and incision, and removed the wires afterwards) and a CT scan. There were other pen markings they made, and wiped off. Today is my first rad! The tech told me that I'll be seeing my RO too. I've been using Moisturel cream to prepare, and have Miaderm too, which I may start using later today. Must shower these off before each treatment.",

Today the techs marked me with a bold blue pen around my incision area that will get the boosts. By the time I got home, my camisole had blue stains all over it. Well, I have it soaking and hope it isn't actually stained. The marks on my skin will be there through next week, but I can still wash gently and apply lotion. They said they will refresh the markings as needed. Wow, the machine will be VERY close for the boosts. I hope they are very careful with that remote that moves it around! No signs of LE, and I hope I can avoid it forever.",
