I have been told I will have to have radiation. I was told about the 3 week option and that sounds good to me. Is it 7 days a week. Also, did you get tired? I work for a bank and it is stressful and I was wondering if I could take medical leave during that time. I will have a commute of 40 minutes each way. Also,how long are you there for treatment? Thanks,  Julie",
