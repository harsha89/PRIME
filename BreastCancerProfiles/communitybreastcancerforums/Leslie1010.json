I feel horrible. My never endings are numb in my fingers, I feel totally out of it, I can't think straight and I have only done one treatment. I feel like my life is an out of body experience right now, evening going to the bathroom I seem to have lost feeling when I wipe? Sorry if that is TMI. I sure hope that this doesn't last long. And i hope it gets better, not worse. I have ten kids, nine at home, just separated in November 2010 and am forty years old.",
