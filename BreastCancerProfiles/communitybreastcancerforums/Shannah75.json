I said yes to the adriamycin, because mine is aggressive... But I'm scared about the heart damage and possible leukemia...not doing anything more until my BRCA test comes back...so I'm still mulling it over...hoping I could hear something from somebody who's taken it before. He said its really just a coin toss, and they can't guarantee anything either way....but if I were his daughter, he'd tell me to take the adriamycin...I guess just make the decision you feel you can live with, and let God take care of the rest.",
