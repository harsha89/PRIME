Yes I had the stretch tight problem but I was told to 'spider walk' my fingers up a wall until I felt the stretch. Then hold it for a couple minutes trying to relax, it will slowly stretch out those shortened ligaments. I am at free range motion now and have not had lasting effects. Good for me is the current mascectomy there were no lymph nodes to take so I do not have to deal with that now.",

One other thing to consider is the pain in your chest could actually be heartburn. However you should definitely be questioning the heart issues. I had a MUGA test before I started and another one after my second treatment. I will find out monday if my heart function is dropping. I started at 84% heart function so it is a concern for me.",

Unfortunately I had extreme pain in the bones, joints and muscles. The day three was horrible, the day four was much better and today was pretty good. So if you get pain with the Taxol it will get better. Do take pain meds as needed. The first round of pain scared me so I want to let you know that it does improve. I am also eating pretty well but am now getting a laxative as all the pain meds didn't help. I did ask the chemo nurse about the pain and she said it may or may not happen again. It does not mean you will have pain everytime. Well I hope I didn't worry anyone but if you know it might happen you won't be as upset about it when it does. Like Peg said I now only have 3 more to go and then I am finished. Yeah.",
