      "Content": "somanywomen wrote:  I know in my hurry I mispelled Bisphenol A  (left off the L, and the Y off chemotherapy) site won't let me edit topic.. Although I am not adding chemo to my treatment, I have been doing a lot of research on BPA's in products since my recent issue of Consumers Reports gave us a big red flag about BPA's.....This imformation I found on a website called breastcancerfund.org, ..says that \"BPA exposure has been shown to interfere with chemo treatment\"......BPA has been totally banned in Norway ....This is long but I hope helpful to all of you that take the time to read...I am extremely concerned about the future health of our sons and daughters... Bisphenol A Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most pervasive chemicals in modern life. More than 2 billion pounds of BPA are produced in the United States each year. As the building block of polycarbonate plastic and a component of epoxy resins, BPA is used in thousands of consumer products, including food packaging. Research suggests that BPA exposure may contribute to the epidemic of breast cancer now and in the future. Furthermore, BPA exposure has been shown to interfere with chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. BPA: A Synthetic Estrogen BPA was developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen (also called xenoestrogen) so it is not surprising that it acts like an estrogen in humans, increasing the risk of breast cancer. Decades of research have shown that extensive exposure to estrogens, both natural and synthetic, increases breast cancer risk. Reducing exposure to estrogens appears to reduce the risk of breast cancer. For example, experts attribute the recent decline in breast cancer incidence to decreased use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT), following the major study that implicated HRT in increased risk of breast cancer. Studies of human breast cancer cells in culture show that BPA acts through the same response pathways as natural estrogen (estradiol), and induces cell growth and proliferation. In addition, BPA has been shown to mimic natural estrogen (estradiol) in causing direct damage to the DNA of cultured human breast cancer cells. Principal Route of Exposure to BPA: Food Packaging BPA is found in the lining of metal food cans and in some plastic food containers, including some baby bottles, water bottles, microwave ovenware and eating utensils. Because BPA is an unstable polymer and is lipophilic (fat-seeking), it can leach into infant formula and other food products, especially when heated. Once in food, BPA can move quickly into people-a real concern for women of childbearing age and for young children. Exposure to BPA Begins in the Womb Exposure to BPA is ubiquitous in the United States and other developed countries, and the exposure begins before birth, when the risk of harm is greatest. BPA has been found in blood samples from developing fetuses as well as in placental tissue and the surrounding amniotic fluid, in umbilical cord blood of newborn infants and in human breast milk. Finding BPA in breast milk confirms the presence of this environmental estrogen in the target organ for breast cancer. A number of animal studies show that prenatal and early life exposure to extremely low levels of BPA alters development of the mammary gland in ways that predispose the animals to cancer in adult life. Exposure also increases sensitivity to estrogen at puberty. Early exposure to BPA also leads to abnormalities in mammary tissue that can be seen during gestation. Animal studies implicate BPA in childhood obesity, which raises the risk of early puberty, a known risk factor for breast cancer. Formula feeding (BPA lined containers and/or baby bottles) rather than breastfeeding is also linked with childhood obesity.  1 Jemal A, Siegel E, Ward E, Murray T, Xu Jiaquan, Smigal C, Thun MJ (2006). Cancer Statistics: 2006. CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians What other countries are doing about BPA In 2007 Norway banned the import of consumer products containing BPA. Canada has declared BPA a toxic chemical and is moving to ban it in baby bottles, the lining of infant formula containers and children's tableware. Taiwan has proposed listing BPA as a potentially toxic substance. Banning the use of BPA could reduce the risk of breast cancer in our daughters and in generations to come. It is time to call a halt to this toxic hand-me-down chemical. Breast cancer facts An estimated 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and more than 40,000 women will die of the disease.22 Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in U.S. women, second only to lung cancer.23 Between 1975 and 2000, breast cancer incidence increased in women ages 20-29.24 Breast cancer incidence for African American women ages 20-45 is twice that for white women the same ages and mortality from breast cancer is higher in African American women. \u201cThere must be some way out of here,\u201d said the joker to the thief, \u201cThere\u2019s too much confusion, I can\u2019t get no relief.\"....All Along the Watchtower..Bob Dylan Dx 9/28/2009, IDC, 1cm, Stage I, Grade 2, 0/2 nodes, ER+/PR+ Log in to post a reply",

It also shows if your heart is in a normal rhythm, how well the conduction system of the heart works, and if any of the chambers of the heart are working too hard (a condition call hypertrophy).\" ",

Mimi, I only use the deoderant on right side, I just dab some nice gentle smelling lotion on my shoulders before going...after rads I am putting the calendula on whether I need it or not....Did you get your call for rad start yet??? My surgery was one day before yours....sure has been a whirlwind hasn't it?....I'm curious to what your rads will be like!! FYI..I ordered most of  the gifts I have to buy for Xmas on STJUDE.ORG, you can go into the gift shop and they have nice gifts and apparel for all and the profits all go to St. Jude....I am just tired of the commercialism of Xmas and at least this way something good to those that truly need it our also effected.....",

One of my previous hand me downs was a Mac and I really liked it...This is my once a year gift, valentines, mothers day, birthday, ground hog day, etc,,..... I forgot to mention during my rant the other evening that while I was at my Onco doc, that he asked me if I had starting my hormone (drug) treatment???..Well, what did he think, that I could write my own prescription??...He has me scheduled for blood work today for tumor markers, curious as to what those are, I guess they check every 12 weeks, anybody know more??...Also I am seeing Nurse to explain the hormone treatment, hopefully she will be honest and forthcoming to give me the truth!!!...I will have my 2nd to last rad today in between these appts.... To All, who's already on hormone drug, which one? and what se's are you experiencing??..Sure will be interesting when we all start our hormone treatment posts to see what else our doctors have left out!!! Jules, sure hope you get some relief, maybe after rads...things will get better.. Tomorrow is my final rad!!!!...We are joining my sister and her husband at a place called Capt. Hirams in Sabastion Florida (about a 30 minute drive south on me), they got tickets to see \"Eddie Money\", Two tickets to Paridise singer.....I can't believe the timing, being my last day of rads and finally get to do something that has nothing to do with doctors or treatments...Yippee..Anyone else want to join us, first glass of wine is on me....",

Are up-and-coming young doctors going to practice the same kind of mainstream medicine as their predecessors? Will the next generation of docs turn up their noses at alternative therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, herbs and vitamins -- just like the majority of the current crop of docs? In what may come as a surprise to many mainstream physicians, the answer to those questions may be a resounding \"no\". According to research published in the online edition of the peer-reviewed journal Evidence-based Complementary and Alternative Medicine (eCAM), 75 percent of medical students surveyed think it would be beneficial for conventional Western medicine to integrate with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM places emphasis on natural therapies and using the body's own healing powers instead of relying on drugs, vaccines and other standard Western treatments.",

My mom was in the hospital for a week a couple of weeks ago, she would call me everday when she got home to have me do this or that, well I don't mind as long as I feel she really needs help, but she is a player...One day she is asking me to bring some milk and oatmeal by her house (she has a little store right next to her condo and a Walmart right next to that) the next day she is able to fly out to Tennessee to visit and go to reunion....What a player!! My left side (surgery area is still sore), have you all healed?....Renee, I hope you get recon as planned....Bonnie, let us know about your mammo results, I always get copies of reports to keep myself, also I got film of my last mammo, I'm not a radiologist by no means, I just feel more comfortable seeing for myself.... I also think that more and more women are being dx daily, I was at the store yesterday and a young friend of mine said her 37 year old sister was recently dx and had a mast....Veggy, seems thyroid surgery is happening more and more to people I know also, most say the scar does get better with time....I find that long walks on the beach does wonders for my lows in thinking...Once it becomes a habit, the benefits are great...Do you have a nice area to walk?....One of my weekly walking friends just went back to Denver (they live here 6 months, then go back), I will miss her, she would go anytime, now I will have to make myself go alone at times... So glad that some of us are keeping this topic going, it's a great place to say what we want with no judgements.......thanks all.......",

(even Coach, Brahmin) and we all got a certain amount per hour to spend on these items, no cash but it was better since we sold such quality items.... In this day and time it is hard to have a voice and hold on to a good job, luckily my husband was able to keep his job from the huge Space Center lay-offs, but we had to take it in Jupiter, now we pay mortgage here and rent down there, it is stretching us and I really had to cut back...We are home in Merritt Isl Fri-Sun Eve and met up with about 6 of his co-workers, including his boss from the Space Center and they are all looking for jobs and are flying all over the country for interviews but having no luck!!...These are all 6 figure professonal engineers and none of them have found anything in the last 2 months of looking...My husband's wonderful ex-boss (one of the now unemployed) said that one of his neighbors actually asked him if she could hire him to tutor her child, we are talking about a man with unbelievable education, I think the reality of his situation hit him right in the face when she asked that!!....We are glad we accepted the relocation but it is weird living in 2 places every week....But after the get together yesterday, I am counting my blessings!!! Think about the volunteering, it gets you out, even for a few hours a day.....Keep us posted, Jewly",

I know for a fact that my husband Alan would still be lying to me if I had not found that trac-phone (that had solid evidence of his affair with a Chere since at least Jan 2012 (works with him at PWR in Jupiter) she's about half his age but can have him, he is now someone that I never thought he would be, she's married so I imagine they are still sneaking around), he thought he was smart enough to live in two worlds, this guy continued to give me gut-wrenching \"I Love You\" cards every Friday for 16 years ( over 800 cards) up until two days before I found this phone and told him to leave!!....His timing was horrendous, there is so much or should I say everything was left for me to handle...We have had a problem with a leaky skylight for years and for years he ignored getting to the root of the problem, he only wanted to start new projects and not take care of the major house problems...I had some of my friends and my sister and her husband try to help me find the water source that was coming into my living room, well they started tearing out the wall and now my whole back wall in my living room is ripped out and a ton of mold that probably has been there for years is behind it....I called my husband and sent him photos, since he is living in an apartment in Stuart now (he doesn't have any problems because he has a landlord) he could do most of this work himself, but now I will have to hire someone, may have to tear out the whole back bathroom to make sure all the hidden mold is gone.... I have to have my roof replaced like real soon, my insurance company Citizens pushed my policy over to some company called Florida Peninsula and they may or may not keep me come renewal in November, I was already told that I have to put the new roof on so I need to do that before I put back up the inside walls so I will be asured that I have no leaks....It has been one thing after another.....What happened to my so-called-life???..........I dream of those boring days where I had no pressure of medical problems, medical bills, Divorce Attorney filings and bills, so much paperwork done wrong time and time again trying to get through this settlement, my house is falling apart..... Oh and did I mention my Oncologist wants me to go to see a friend of his at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville because I was lucky enough to test positive for two Blood Clotting genes.....Factor V Van Lieden and something called Lupus Anti-coagulant .....He said he had patients that had one or the other but never that had tested for both...I guess this specialist will give me an idea of how long I have to stay on these Blood thinners I have been on since Sept when I had the DVT ....If you ever want to call me just private email me.....Hope we all get our lives back on track, no one realizes just how much a medical problem can do to our lives...

      "Content": "Dec 31, 2009 08:28AM - edited Dec 31, 2009 08:30AM by somanywomen FYI,..sorry, I know this is a huge post, but I found it to be soooooooo interesting about radiation therapy types (found at lef.org)...I would definately have chose the \"Proton beam radiation therapy\".... Cancer Radiation Therapy Along with surgery and chemotherapy, radiation therapy (radiotherapy) is one of the most important methods of cancer treatment. At least 50 percent of all cancer patients will receive radiotherapy at some stage during the course of their illness. It is currently used to treat localized solid tumors, such as cancers of the skin, brain, breast, or cervix, and can also be used to treat leukemia and lymphoma (Tobias JS 1992). Most types of radiation do not attack cancer cells specifically, and therefore cause injury to normal tissues surrounding the tumor. The adverse effects are a major factor limiting the success of radiation treatment. However, proton therapy and CyberKnife® therapy are technologically advanced forms of radiotherapy that cause little damage to normal tissue because they focus intensely on the tumor. The effectiveness of radiation therapy can be enhanced by both radiosensitizers, such as genistein, curcumin, green tea, and hyperthermia, and radioprotectors, such as ginseng, glutathione, whey protein, and shark liver oil. Overall, the use of specific nutritional supplements, drugs, and other strategies may prevent and help to alleviate and treat the side effects caused by radiation, and thereby improve the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Principles of Radiation Therapy (Radiotherapy) Radiation therapy is the treatment of cancer with ionizing radiation. Radiation works by damaging the DNA (genetic material) within the tumor cells, making them unable to divide and grow. Radiation is often given with the intent of destroying the tumor and curing the disease (curative treatment). However, although radiation is directed at the tumor, it is inevitable that the normal, non-cancerous tissues surrounding the tumor will also be affected by the radiation and therefore damaged (Burnet NG et al. 1996). The goal of radiation therapy is to maximize the dose to tumor cells while minimizing exposure to normal, healthy cells (Emami B et al. 1991). Because no single therapy can provide complete treatment for a patient with a solid tumor, radiotherapy is often used in combination with surgery or chemotherapy to improve the chances of a successful treatment outcome. Sometimes radiation is used to relieve symptoms, such as pain or seizures; this is called palliative treatment (Hoskin PJ et al. 1992). What Is Ionizing Radiation? Radiation used for cancer treatment is called ionizing radiation because it forms ions as it passes through a tissue. Ions are atoms that have acquired an electric charge through the gain or loss of an electron (Dunne-Daly CF 1999). Ions can cause cell death or genetic change either directly or indirectly. The direct effect causes a change in the molecular structure of biologically important molecules, most likely DNA. The indirect action of radiation occurs when it interacts with water molecules in the cells, resulting in the production of highly reactive and unstable free radicals or reactive oxygen species, which immediately react with any biomolecules in the surrounding area, producing cellular damage (Fang YZ et al. 2002). This damage can lead to cell death by two mechanisms (Ross GM 1999). The first process, known as apoptosis, results in cell death within a few hours of radiation (Kerr JF et al. 1994). The second mechanism is radiation-induced failure of cell division and the inhibition of cellular proliferation, which in turn leads to cell death. Several enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense mechanisms exist in cells and prevent excessive damage through the scavenging and inactivation of these reactive oxygen species (Mates JM et al. 2000). Types of Radiation Therapy External beam radiation therapy (EBRT). EBRT creates a radiation beam and aims it at the tumor. The radiation adequately covers the tumor but minimizes the dose to the non-tumor normal tissues. Radiation is given in fractions rather than as a single dose, and the use of this fractionated radiotherapy allows normal cells time to repair between each radiation session, protecting them from injury. Conventional fractionation in the United States is 1.8 to 2 Gray (Gy) per day, administered five days a week for five to seven weeks, depending on the particular clinical situation. (Gray is a unit of measure of absorbed radiation dose.) While this schedule is strictly for the convenience of physicians trying to maintain a normal workweek, the relatively long intervals between doses of radiation may allow cancer cells (as well as normal cells) to recover and regrow. A number of different radiotherapy schedules have been suggested to overcome this problem (Shah N et al. 2000). These include hyperfractionation, in which the time between fractions is reduced from 24 hours to 6 to 8 hours to enhance the toxic effects on tumor cells (Fu KK et al. 2000) while still preserving an adequate time interval for the recovery of normal cells. Continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiation therapy (CHART) is an intense schedule of treatment, in which multiple daily fractions are administered within a short period of time. Clinical studies have shown benefits of altered fractionation over conventional treatment for several cancers, including head and neck cancer (Goodchild K et al. 1999) and non-operable lung cancer (Ghosh S et al. 2003). Proton beam radiation therapy. This is one of the most precise and sophisticated forms of external beam radiation therapy available. The advantage of proton radiation therapy over x-rays is its ability to deliver higher doses of shaped beams of radiation directly into the tumor while minimizing the dose to normal tissues. This leads to reduced side effects and improved survival rates (Suit HD 2003). As of 2002, more than 32,000 patients around the world had received part or all of their radiation treatment by proton beams. There are approximately 19 proton treatment centers worldwide. Two major hospital-based facilities in the United States that regularly treat patients with proton beams (often fractionated) are Loma Linda University Medical Center in southern California (LLUMC Proton Treatment Center) and the Northeast Proton Treatment Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. The Midwest Proton Radiotherapy Institute in Bloomington, Indiana (www.mpri.org/) treats children and adults with certain brain tumors, as well as those with tumors that are close to vital organs and therefore cannot be treated successfully using traditional methods. The efficacy of proton beam radiation therapy has been clinically proven (Shipley WU et al. 1995) in prostate (Slater JD et al. 1999; Zietman AL et al. 2005), lung (Bush DA et al. 1999), hepatocellular (Matsuzaki Y et al. 1995), and uveal melanoma (Courdi A et al. 1999; Munzenrider JE 1999; Spatola C et al. 2003), sarcomas of the skull base and cervical spine (Munzenrider JE et al. 1999), optic pathway gliomas (Fuss M et al. 1999), astrocytomas (Habrand JL et al. 1999), benign meningioma (Gudjonsson O et al. 1999), non-resectable rectal, esophageal (Koyama S et al. 2003), and liver cancers (Ask A et al. 2005b), head and neck cancers, including thyroid cancer (Ask A et al. 2005a; Sugahara S et al. 2005), and more. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT creates a shaped radiation beam, delivering high doses of radiation to the tumor and significantly smaller doses of radiation to the surrounding normal tissues (Hurkmans CW et al. 2002; Nutting C et al. 2000). This may result in a higher cancer-control rate and a lower rate of side effects (Garden AS et al. 2004; Welsh JS et al. 2005). IMRT has been used successfully in the treatment of several types of cancer, including prostate (De Meerleer G et al. 2004), cervical (Ahmed RS et al. 2004), nasopharyngeal (Kwong DL et al. 2004), and pediatric cancers (Penagaricano JA et al. 2004). Brachytherapy. Brachytherapy can be used for many types of cancers, but it is most commonly used to treat prostate cancer (Woolsey J et al. 2003) and gynecologic cancers, such as cervical or uterine cancer (Nakano T et al. 2005). Brachytherapy usually involves the insertion of devices around or within the tumor to hold radioactive sources or seeds. Radioactive isotopes, such as cesium, are then inserted into the delivery device, either temporarily or permanently, allowing for the slow delivery of a high dose of radiation to the interior of the tumor (Fieler VK 1997). Radioimmunotherapy (RIT). Radioimmunotherapy, one of the newest developments in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Harris M 2004), has achieved a high tumor response rate (up to 80 percent) in several clinical trials (Witzig TE et al. 2002). Radioimmunotherapy uses drugs called monoclonal antibodies, which have a radioactive isotope attached to them. This is targeted to the surface of a cancer cell, destroying it. Radioimmunotherapy can be used (in a targeted fashion) to treat single cells that have spread around the body (Riley MB et al. 2004). Because the radiation does not concentrate in any one area of the body, radioimmunotherapy does not cause side effects commonly seen with external beam radiation therapy. The most significant side effect associated with radioimmunotherapy may be a temporary drop in white blood cell or platelet count (Witzig TE et al. 2003). Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). SBRT is a standard form of treatment for primary and metastatic brain cancer (Phillips MH et al. 1994). It is delivered using a machine called a gamma knife, which uses converging beams of gamma radiation that meet at a central point within the tumor, where they add up to a very high, precisely focused dose of radiation in a single fraction. Due to this precision, the cancer can be located in an area of the brain or spinal cord that might normally be considered inoperable (Song DY et al. 2004). CyberKnife®. CyberKnife® is a non-invasive, precise radiation technique that can deliver concentrated and accurate beams of radiation to any site in the body. This system combines robotics and advanced image guidance cameras to locate the tumor\u2019s position in the body and deliver highly focused beams of radiation that converge at the tumor, avoiding normal tissue. It is a successful method used to treat spinal tumors (Gerszten PC et al. 2004b) or tumors at other critical locations that are not amenable to open surgery or radiation, as well as to treat medically inoperable patients (Gerszten PC et al. 2004a). It can also be used to treat benign tumors and lesions in a previously irradiated site, or to boost standard radiotherapy (Bhatnagar AK et al. 2005; Degen JW et al. 2005). Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). 3D-CRT is a technique that uses imaging computers to precisely map the location of a tumor (Symonds RP 2001). The patient is fitted with a plastic mold or cast to keep the body part still so that the radiation can be aimed more accurately from several directions. By aiming the radiation more precisely at the tumor, it is possible to reduce radiation damage to normal tissues surrounding the tumor by up to 50 percent (Perez CA et al. 2002). Radiation Therapy versus Medical X-rays (Diagnostic Imaging) Although diagnostic x-rays provide great benefits, including the earlier detection of cancers and the possibility of early treatment, their use is associated with small increases in cancer risk (Ron E 2003). One study estimated that cancer risk due to diagnostic x-rays varied from 0.6 percent to 3 percent in the 15 developed countries studied (Berrington de Gonzalez A et al. 2004). Therefore, it is prudent to avoid unnecessary x-ray procedures. Up to 30 percent of chest x-rays may not be necessary (McCreath GT et al. 1999). Unnecessary computed tomography (CT) examinations may result in increased radiation exposure (Fleszler F et al. 2003; Frush DP 2004). The cumulative risk of cancer mortality from CT examinations in the United States is about 800 radiation-induced cancer deaths per 1 million examinations in children under the age of 15 (Brenner D et al. 2001). Mammography (chest x-ray) uses low-dose x-rays to create a detailed image of the breasts. Although there is some controversy regarding mammography\u2019s effectiveness in reducing breast cancer mortality, successful treatment is linked to early diagnosis, as mammography can often show changes in the breast before they can be detected by manual examination (Olsen O et al. 2001). The effective radiation dose from a mammogram is about the same as the average person receives from background radiation over a three-month period (Sabel M et al. 2001). At present, the consensus view is that the benefits of screening women over 50 years of age with yearly or twice-yearly mammograms substantially outweighs the associated risks due to radiation exposure (Beckett JR et al. 2003). However, there appears to be no significant benefit for women under the age of 40, and there may be harm for women under 30 due to the danger of cancer developing after exposure to radiation (Brenner DJ et al. 2002). Therefore, the main area of controversy concerns women between the ages of 40 and 49. Again, I apologize for those who find this way too long...but hope it will be as imformative for you as I have found this article to me.....",

All of mine will have exited on or about Feb. 15th........Of course se's could effect us for years, I have read in \"The Merck Manual\" that 10% to 20% of rad patients will get mild pneumonitis about 3-6 months after rads...and about 5% will get asymtomatic rib fractures ..funny our doctors never mentioned this....surprise...surprise!!!!!!! To All, once we all have the list of foods, we will have to get creative and share recipes that include these foods....One more item, I must mention is a replacement for mayonaise (very bad food for us!!) I was never a big mayo fan but now that I am trying to include more cabbage, cole slaw makes sense, and you can replace your mayo with\"Vegenaise\", this is a great product made from grapeseed oil...Milk is another food that I am trying to give up, and believe it or not, there is a carton of \"Rice Dream\" (sold cold in milk-like carton where reg milk is), made from brown rice and it's not bad, I was very surprised...one 8 oz gives you 10% A, 30% calcium, 25% D, 2% iron, 15% phosphorus, and 25% B12.............. PS, I don't know when I am going to get the nerve to take that first arimidex!!!! Heal well, everyone......",

Jules...go up to my posts about 3 up from this one and read about tumeric (you have smart husband)....and you will learn even more once you get your book!!!... I was told my first follow up mammo would be in about March/April..6 months from my last in Sept 09....Make sure they check both breasts, I have heard that a lot of times they only check the one......",

To All...I took my first arimidex yesterday morn with coffee.....the only thing I noticed was I woke up more often last eve...Just took my second, only 1823 to go...... I do need to walk more so my friend and I are taking her Christmas present (metal detector) and one of my Christmas presents (plastic bucket, 2 shovels and a sifter) to the beach today and we are going to hunt for our fortune...Wish us luck!!!",

We should get something besides pain from them, after all they were trying to charge my Ins. company $2000. a day (not what my Ins. agreed to pay, but what they originally billed for) that would have been 30 X $2000 + $60,000...just for rads....absolutely insane.... Everyone, have a nice relaxing painfree Sunday...Even if you have to dope yourselves up!! LOL Renee, when are these docs going to take some responsibility!!!...Of course it  is the rads causing your skin to break open, look at all the women on this site that have had the same reaction!!!..Maybe we should tell the docs to read this cite so they have a clue and start thinking, duhhhhhhh!!!...They are always so ready to blame it on something else, yeah right maybe it's an allergic reaction to water when you shower, or maybe it's caused by breathing air, or better yet maybe it's because you live in the U.S and we have doctors that because of thier ego won't admit that it could possibly be related to what they have done (burn the he_ _ out of your skin!)...Once they start admitting this, maybe just maybe, we might start getting a better answer on how they can help prevent this from happening to their future patients!!!!!...Where do we get one of those caring doctors that they make movies about!!!!!!...Get mad and make sure you let him know, that the treatment obviouslly caused your reaction...he may play stupid but we are not stupid!!!!! Renee, I was so mad about your doc I forgot to say, yes I have a follow up Feb 12, about a month after finishing rads..Don't know after that about followups.....",

We discussed many things including diet and she told me that she only wished that most of her patients would take it upon themselves to change thier diets as I had done and we talked about the many environmental concerns that may be causing more  health problems....She spent about 30 minutes with me while I continued to dress and was standing by the door....I thanked her for her honesty and time....When I went to the counter to check out an pay, I was told that thier would be no charge.....I left feeling that I truly wished that I could find a bc doctor with her character.....",

The study reviewed here found that women diagnosed with breast cancer who also were taking a beta-blocker high blood pressure medicine were much less likely to develop metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to parts of the body away from the breast) or to die from breast cancer compared to women who weren't taking a beta-blocker. These results were presented at the 2010 European Breast Cancer Conference. Beta-blockers treat high blood pressure by blocking beta receptors. Blocking beta receptors blocks the effect of the hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, on the body. Beta receptors are in many tissues, including blood vessels, the heart, and the lungsPatients taking beta blockers had a 57% reduction in the risk of distant metastasis and a 71% reduction in the risk of breast cancer-specific death, as compared with patients on other antihypertensive agents or no antihypertensive therapy, Des Powe, PhD, reported here at the European Breast Cancer Conference.",

      "Content": "Sep 10, 2010 04:14PM somanywomen wrote: Kskier, Hope this helps..  NaturalNews) Low white blood cell counts are indicative of a suppressed immune system and can have many causes. Emotional state and stress, an unhealthy diet and lifestyle, and nutritional intake can all cause lower immune system response and low white blood cell counts. Low immunity can also be caused by a number of health conditions, by surgical or medical treatments and by the natural aging process. Whatever the cause, low immunity and low white blood cell counts prevent the body from being able to have an optimum response to infections and illness. Here are some things which can help prevent low immunity and keep white blood cell counts high: - Avoid sugar and keep sweet stuff to a minimum. Sugar prevents white blood cells from being their strongest - Eliminate unhealthy fats. Polyunsaturated fats in vegetable oils such as corn, safflower, and sunflower oil are deterrents to a healthy immune system. - If you are overweight, lose a few pounds. Being overweight is very detrimental to your immune system and studies have shown that overweight people are less able to fight off infection. - Drink plenty of water to boost the immune system as well as flush out toxins - Exercise is a proven immune system booster. Exercise is best in moderation, however, since too much exercise may wear the body down and create immune system problems. - Avoid stress and try to relax. Stress is rightly called the silent killer and too much stress invariably leads to a lowered immune system. Many food items help boost immune function and white blood cell counts. For example: Carrots and other red, yellow, orange, and dark-green leafy vegetables contain beta carotene which helps protect the immune system, especially the thymus gland. Beta carotene and other carotenes also strengthen white blood cell production, and foods rich in beta-carotene help the body better fight off infection. Yogurt can be very beneficial for the immune system. It helps the body produce antibodies and strengthens white blood cells. A cup of kale will give you your daily requirement of vitamin A. This is an antioxidant that helps your body fight cancer cells and is essential in the formation of white blood cells. Vitamin A also increases the ability of antibodies to respond to invaders. People who eat more garlic have more natural killer white blood cells. Other helpful foods include chicken, kale, almonds, guava, crab, dark grapes and navy beans.",

Afterthought...I have read many articles about alcohol and bc...Some say that if you do drink to make sure you add folic acid to your diet....So much info that I always take it before drinking any alcohol at all..The supplement \"resveratrol\" is a red wine extract without the alcohol effects...",

Jules, the Doctor Oz show was somewhat confusing about the use of plastic...My understanding was the number 7 in a triangle on bottom of plastic containers was bad, so I did research to make sure and here is info: Foods in #7 plastic containers and the majority of canned foods are exposed to this toxic chemical. Bisphenol-A is a plastic and resin ingredient used to line metal food and drink cans, and it's a main building block for polycarbonate (PC) plastics. Even at low doses, Bisphenol A has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information...(The mission of the Environmental Working Group (EWG) is to use the power of public information to protect public health and the environment.) So, what can you do to avoid exposing yourself to this chemical? The EWG report linked above has some suggestions, but here are the top ways you can avoid it:",

I forgot to mention that in Florida, we usually do not have a winter, but this year we have had about 3 months of cold (under 60 degree weather) my dog went crazy the first few nights, he jumped in our bed and got between us and shook like crazy, like he was scared...well since then he is sleeping in our bed every night...he takes up about 1/3 of the bed and somehow we have gotten use to it and hardly notice him now.....Jewly",

I have complained to everyone of my docs on follow-up visits...The rad doc said it's a hematoma..not!!!!!...The onco said it is a fibrous band..not!!!..The surgeon said it just needs more healing time.....Well, low and behold, I just had my 6 month follow-up mammo/us and asked the tech to check out that area, there on the mammo is a clump of surgical clips!!..at least 6 of them bundled together, all in that area of concern...When I saw my surgeon a few days ago he said that these clips are left in all the time and that is not the cause of my irritation and that he did not advise removing them, I am telling you that I know that it is, it feels exactly like it looks on the mammo....He told me to ignore it, I wish I could.. When I told him that I had tightness around and down my arm, he also said that could not be the cause...I believe it is the cause because this clump of tissue and clips probably are hindering blood flow in that area, it only makes sense!!..I found a website of over 150 comments of people having problems with areas where clips were placed and thier doctors trying to tell them that the clips are not the cause of thier concerns just like mine!!! I would advise all of you to actually ask to view your films from mammo/us to see if and where these clips might have been left in your body.. esp., if you are not healing as you should.....",

Diane, isn't it strange how doctors don't ask if you have Rads doctor until too late!!...If my husband had not been working with a girl that has cancer and asked him who my Rads doctor ( I would probably be in the same boat), I was able to get in before making lumpectomy vs mastectomy decision...Luckily while I was at my appointment she (Rad doc) asked who my Onclologist was (I didn't have one of those either) and she got me in immediately to see him also....Both are at the Cancer Treatment Center where I now go.....I would call around also for others in area just to get it over with and now is a good time, my husband will be off the last 2 weeks of my rads and go with me....Good luck to you!!! I found \"Toms  Calendula natural moisturizing bar soap\" and Calendula Gel (7% calendula)  today...just in case....But there is a spray called \"Hyland's Calendula Spray\", it is over 20% calendula that I may have to order to get.....How did everyone do today??

Jules, thanks for birthday wish, but my son woke up to a $3200. dollar estimate to get his car fixed, (had stopped working completely day before) needs a new motor....he was in tears....Since he drives to college (about 45 minutes a day) it is extremely important that he has a reliable car, we had just put new tires on it....Now he must make a decision  to repair or replace (sounds like some of our decisions), he buses tables at a local restaurant and saves all his money and we were hoping this fund would give him a good head start when he finishes college, hate that he may have to use some of it for car repair or another car!!..At least he just has one final exam Mon and then not have to go until Jan 2010, also a good friend of mine is loaning him their extra car until he can figure out what to do....so it could be worse.....

Grama5, I saw my surgeon yesterday (follow-up), I think he was sorry when he asked how my rad treatments were going...when I explained this new adventure of frustration...I said that I had a lot of confidence in him and since he got clear margins and no lymph involvement, why couldn't I just go with that and not do the rads....He replied....\"because with rads, my same breast has about a 11% recurrence and without rads about 35% recurrence.\"..He also told me very seriously to follow the hormonal treatment after rads...Bah humbug!!!! Mimi, as to my during rads vitamins/supplements (I will be adding a lot more after rads)...At this time I take \"Women's Life Force Multiples\" made by Source Naturals and sold at the Vitamin Shoppe, please go on line to the Vitamin Shoppe website and view the ingredients...ton of vits and supps in these!!!..the dose is 3 per day up to 6, I am only taking one so divide the percent of daily value by 3...I will take 2 after rads.....I am also taking folic acid -400 mg, red wine extract-200mg, d-3 2000 iu's.......and zyflamend by New Chapter, also full of stuff like tumeric, green tea, ginger etc.....Please do your own research and only do what you and your doc agree on...I just happen to believe in a little more than most when it comes to supplements....so only do what you do research on......I have also changed about 80% of our food to organic (they say if your grandma didn't eat it, then neither should you), what we are finding is that everthing seems to have more flavor, my husband has lost 10 lbs and feels great, my nineteen year old even likes most of it, although he is still getting his share of the bad stuff!!!!...From what I keep reading is that for the first time in history if the US keeps allowing our food to be so compromised that ever generation from now on will die younger and younger...that is just too sad....unfortunately so true........",

How To Healthy Sauté Start your Healthy Sauté by heating 1 to 2 TBS of broth in a stainless steel skillet over medium heat. Once the broth begins to bubble, add onions and sauté stirring frequently. After the onions have cooked for about 5 minutes, you can then add other ingredients, such as garlic or fresh ginger. Once they have had a chance to cook together for just another minute or two, add other vegetables and cover. This method enables you to have flavorful sautéed vegetables without heating oil. For even richer flavor, toss your sautéed vegetables with a little extra virgin olive oil after removing them from the heat.",

Bonnie, did not know you had so much trouble with tamoxifen, so far I don't have many se's from arimidex.. It's funny how my surgeon just flat out does not think that the clump, yes clump of surgical clips could be giving me the irritation feeling as though something is rubbing from under my skin...You should see the xray, it is a big (6 clips) clump intertwined exactly where the sensations are..Just seem logical to me!!!...He told me to ignore it and trust my doctor.... I also saw a breast cancer surgeon yesterday in Orlando, I couldn't believe how many women were there for appts....Basically, I had wanted a second opinion, since I really don't have a breast doctor (have gen surgeon and gen onco) I had a question about pagent's since I had redness and itchyness...Both she and my surgeon said no I do not have pagents...She told me if I were under her care that they do the mammos/us and a yearly mri, also they do a abdomen ct every year...I guess they are really thorough, that seems like a lot of cts....I don't think I will change doctors but I do see the relevance of having a breast expert...They even had me do a ultrasound yesterday, said it was standard for first visit (even though I brought copies of my mammos and ultrasounds and said I had just had one last Friday) I told them that only if my insurance approved it since I had just had one, I asked the assitant to make sure about my ins, she came back in and assured my it was covered, but I'm still wondering if it was about boosting $$ for visit....

Dry mouth comes about when the salivary glands don't work properly. It is a common side effect of many medicines, including those for high blood pressure and depression. Long-lasting mouth dryness may also be the result of head and neck radiation treatments, chemotherapy, nerve damage, stress, or diseases such as thyroid disease, diabetes, AIDS, Parkinson's disease and autoimmune conditions such as Sjögren's (pronounced \"show-grens\") Syndrome, a disorder in which the person's own immune system targets moisture-producing glands and causes dryness in the mouth and eyes. Contrary to popular belief, dry mouth is not a normal part of aging. There is currently no cure for severe salivary gland damage. In the meantime, certain treatments may help some people with dry mouth. Dr. Baum advises chewing sugarless gum or candy and drinking lots of fluid to keep your mouth moist.",

I am having another re-scan this Thurs (ultrasound) because they tech took about 5 minutes total to scan both breasts, I have had so many that I spoke with her supervisor and she agreed with me 100% that 5 minutes was not enough time to do a thorough exam, what is wrong with these people, it is our lives they are dealing with..Don't take anything for granted Valerie, even though you are depressed and all that crap that comes with this horrible news, stand your ground and get the treatment you deserve and  respect of those who hold your health in thier hands...Question all that bothers you, good luck and please keep us posted....Jewly",

DVT and the Scares continue) he was still saying \"we can fix this\", I said \"not in a million years\"....Somehow, I have gotten through the most over-whelming of days of Doctors, results, Attorney and all that goes along with Divorce, and so many home issues, I am surprising myself with all that has been thrown at me...At my lowest point while going through the mold in my house and having to gut living room, bath room, I was so mad that I actually called Chere at work and told her that if she thought that this affair was only going to effect my side of life, that someday it will effect her family, I was so shocked when the only thing she said to me was \"YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF!!!!...WOW, can't believe all I have been through all that I have and that's the only thing she had to say to me after carrying on with my also no conscience husband, I guess they really deserve each other......Thank God, I have good friends that have been there for me....And you guys, thanks for being there also...Jewly",

Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome (PBTPS) is an underreported condition believed to affect 10- 30% of women who have undergone surgical procedures for breast cancer. <font>1<\/font> While prior studies have looked at post mastectomy (PMPS) or post axillary dissection pain syndromes (PADS), recent articles have reported a more encompassing condition which we term PBSPS. PBSPS not only results from injury to nerves during surgery; it is now believed that radiation and chemotherapy play a role in aggravating the condition. <font>2<\/font> Because of its multivariate causes, PBSPS encompasses many different symptoms which can range from mild to debilitating in severity: chest and upper arm pain, numbness, edema, continuous aching and burning associated with chronic dysesthesia, allodynia (hypersensitivity to pain) and phantom breast tactile sensation/pain. The onset of symptoms can range from directly following breast surgery: mastectomy, axillary dissection, or other invasive procedure, to 6 months after. <font>3<\/font> Symptoms generally persist beyond the normal 3 month healing period. Quality of life issues surrounding women diagnosed with PBTPS have prompted us to look at this recently acknowledged condition. Forty percent of women diagnosed with PBSPS reported increased pain with movement, leading to arm restriction and frozen shoulder syndrome. <font>1<\/font> Over 50% of women experience pain during their daily chores, and over half reported sleep disturbances.",

Jules, try to sneak on puter when you can, I was wondering where you went!! Mimi, wow ....thank you for the imfo on cording, you are right, our doctors do not give us any imformation until after it happens, they think they will just scare us and that we are too stupid to understand something that may or may not happen...I like all the knowledge I can get that way my mind doesn't jump to \"more cancer\" when something like cording was to happen...If I hadn't been prepared for my breast soreness and sometimes redness, I probably would be thinking I had IBC right now....So thank you, thank you , thank you.....They only take my blood pressure  once a week, no weighing, with my new healthy diet, I wish they would!!!...I have lost about 10 pounds since this started about 3 months ago.... Jayne, I asked about my treatment plan yesterday and was told I am getting 60 \"Grays\", first time I had heard the word, my husband (a rocket engineer was not even familiar with term \"Gray\"), I was told I receive 2 a day, one on each side left breast for 25 days with the last week the 2 grays are concentrated into the lumpectomy area only..... Cowgirl, Mimi, Jules, Lissette, Bonnie and all...how many \"Grays\" are you getting???",

Mimi and RunswithScissors, when I used to want nice material things (diamonds & gold) I would put them on a one-year no interest account at my favorite jewelry store and would have my husband and son make larger payments on my birthday, Mother's day, Valentine's day and Christmas (I called it my once-a-year-gift)..that way I got one really nice gift instead of a bunch of smaller gifts that I didn't want, I know it sounds selfish (I'm over being that materialistic now), but my husband and son would go to the jewelry store and make the payments and have the payments wrapped up in a pretty box, so it was fun and it made it easy for them, so it might work with your hubbys.... RunningWS..the calendula I found is Boiron's Calendula gel, found at \"Vitamin Shoppe\", but what I really wanted was the cream or even the spray, this one only has 7%  calendula, so look for the most calendula in a product...I just found Hyland's Calendula Spray on \"Vitamin Shoppe\" website and I am going to order it, has 22% calendula and a spray just sounds like it will feel good..it's on sale for about $10....",

Anyone started arimidex yet???...What are effects so far??? I think everyone will like the simple way that the book \"Foods to Fight Cancer\" explains the anti-cancer foods (mostly veges and some fruits) work against cancer...like there is a chapter on green tea and another chapter on tumeric shows that curcumin/tumeric alone is absorbed by the body 1000 times more when you add piperine/pepper to it!!!..and to get even a more profound effect against cancer to add green tea (EGCG) to this combination, therefore now when I add tumeric with pepper to anything, I take a green tea supplement....Don't just skip to these chapters, please read all the short very imformative chapters leading up why it will all make sense to change our bad American eating habits...There are no recipes in this book so we will have to share the combinations that work.... Steeny, I hope I get your walking habits, I am still finding excuses not too..I found it easy to change bad food habits, and know how valuable walking will be in addition....Maybe, now that rads are over I will begin.... heidi, I thought those beautiful horses looked alike, father and son, what a wonderful way to leave cancer at home and get to drive those horses on the beach of all places...I am in awwww......

Welcome Ellen, healing time for you now too...Yippee!!!...I have been taking Arimidex for one month and so far have not noticed any se's....Do you know what your doc is going to put you on?..I started mine day after rads, why the delay?...

I saw my rad doc for last time yesterday, since my surgeon will take over my mammos, she had wanted to do a left breast mammo 6 months after rads, surgeon wanted to do it 6 months after surgery (so I am scheduled for this April) instead of July....When I saw my surgeon also yesterday, he said I will see him every 3 months for the next 3 years and have left b mammo every 6 months and both 1x a year...I like him much more than the rad doc and never saw her much anyway during those 30 visits which they are still trying to charge me $30. copay as an office visit for each one...30x30= $900....I am fighting charge with ins co...Did anyone else have to pay a visit charge each rad treatment??? Adrienne, I am not giving up on finding my fortune, two of my friends and I are headed to the beach today for our walk and will be taking 2 metal detectors to do treasure hunting...So, I will let you know when yacht party will be...",

She is this amazing beautiful woman and mother.  This dreadful disease took advantage of her body and invaded her brain.  She decided to do hospice and requested anyone to come meet her face to face in FL.  Michelle has this amazing spirit that you can not explain.  It will be an honor to meet her in person.   Polly and I are looking into going the week of March 7th.  If anyone else wants to join us please let us know. Flights are pretty darn cheap, and we can find some cheap hotels. I am up for driving from NJ if I can get at least 2 other people to share the drive time.  I can pick you up along the way on I-95.  Whether we drive or fly this will be a trip that none of us will ever forget of it.   } Wow, I would love to meet her, I am going to give this some thought, Jewly",

I just wonder if any of you felt anything like a cutting/sandspur like irratation at sentinal node removal area......also how long did it take your lumpectomy/sentinal node area to heal after surgery.... I have a mammo/us early next month, has anyone had there 6 month mammo yet?.....I appreciate any input.....thank you",

My so-called husband knew about the smell and dampness behind the wall unit, but he had been in La La land for many years and lost interest in improving this house..I have done wonders in the last 6 months, it looks better than ever...My ex was here on Sunday to collect some of his belongings (1st time I had seen him in about 7 months) he doesn't even look the same, something is very different as to the way I see him now, I felt nothing for this guy he has turned into, it was wierd, I could not even feel sorry for him with his breakdowns that day (maybe just a show, I don't know), I am told he only acts that way around me and that he acts fine at work etc....He says he is so so sorry, but he never tried to end this before he got caught (just kept on stabbing me in the back for at least 10 months, probably more)... He told me it was the biggest regret of his life!.......I wished him well when he left, like I said, it was wierd, I do not know this person, my husband died...I don't know what's going to happen when his company in Jupiter/West Palm gets taken over in June, I guess he and Chere will keep thier jobs, I really don't know if they are still together, all I know is my husband did not make it through his mid-life crisis. Veggy, I hope you get great results from your recent x-ray....Everyone sounds good, keep up the good work... I am right here at Port Canaveral if any of you ever want to get together for a Cruise, I am going on one at the end of July...I need it and I am up for new adventures, always thought that my future was pretty spelled out, but as we all know, we or anyone else do not know when thier life will change in a moment....Here's hoping all those changes from now on will be positive ones.....Jewly",

Met with Alan .yesterday to discuss a few things...Met him half way at Sabastian.....Lots to discuss, some paperwork done etc... but he still doesn't get it about where all of us have been coming from since first diagnosis, we change, no one knows how scared we are because we are the Moms and have to stay strong, I for one am sick of being so strong, I want to be a little girl and lean on a very strong faithfull man.....My husband felt he was the neglected one and chose to take the way (ego what about me attititude) out instead of being there for me...I know he is in a dark place, but unfortunately he chose that road...We had a good life!...well I thought we did until he got caught!! So far I believe her husband does not have the truth about the two of them, if Alan thinks it's bad now with the guilt he says he has, it is only going to get worse when more people on the other side that have been lied to for at least a  year and a half find out about..It is just the combo of the two of them selfishly destroyed so many lives and he says that they have no future plans, I said so you gave up 16 years of your past to know you have no future plans.....He says he knows he has destroyed his future, I have to write this because I just do......I just want to find a Happy Place......Jewly So glad you are coming back on now and then like me......Miss all of our discussions about anything and everything... Hope everyone is very good, one day at a time......To us!!!!!....Jewly",

For each patient, this benefit must be weighed against the risk of adverse events. Chemotherapy-related adverse events occur in almost all patients and more than 1 in 10 women experience a serious or life-threatening event.4 Between 1 in 100 to 1 in 500 women actually die from side effects related to the administration of chemotherapy. Late adverse effects of chemotherapy also occur, including development of second primary cancers in more than 1 in 20 women and cognitive dysfunction, or so-called \u201cchemo-fog.\u201d Other adverse effects include ovarian failure, cardio-toxicity, nausea and hair loss. As Paik et al. concluded, \u201cthe likelihood of 10-year distant recurrence in patients treated with tamoxifen alone is about 15%, at least 85% of patients would be over-treated with chemotherapy if it were offered to everyone.\u201d2 ",
