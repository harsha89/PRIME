So there is something else there. I certainly am mindful of the stomach issues. We are staying on top of kidney lab work every 6 months. You are very correct in the cost difference as my prescriptions of Ibuprofen and Naproxen are minimal, not so with the Ketoprofen.",

I know that Dr. Rockson was doing some sort of study with Ketoprofen at some point. Not sure if he is still working on that one. I can tell you that after reading about it last year, I asked my MO about trying a Ketoprofen regiment for my lymphedema that has been quite problematic for 6/7 years. He had the pharmacist call Stanford and inquire on what dosage Dr. Rockson was giving his patients, but they would not reveal this. So he put me on a daily low dose of Ketoprofen in June of last year, and I must say that it is the first time in 6/7 years that I have gotten relief from the pain I constantly had in that arm. My pain is not completely gone, but much improved. It really has made a huge difference. I am grateful for the dedication Dr. Rockson has for this rotten side effect of cancer treatment.",

I look at it this way, those little lymph nodes were doing their job. Thankgoodness!!!
