I do not test positvie for the BRCA1 or 2 gene.  NEVER has any Dr. tell me that the cancer history on my father's side is insignificant!  They just say I have a double whammy.  AND they had also said that the fact I am not BRCA1/2 negative does not mean that it is not genetic.  It means that it is likely we have a gene that has not yet been identified. I have been getting mammograms since I was 30 yrs old because of family history -- every year.  My breasts are fibrocystic and dense.  I have almost always had to go back for additional views, US and/or MRI.  I have had multiple biopsies and cyst aspirations.  This year, the mammogram showed an abnormality.  Got called back in for US.  Referred to BS.  He did a core needle biopsy.  That came back negative, but he wanted to remove the lump anyway since the cells were abnormal and given my family history, etc, he figured we should take it out and be done with it.  Guess, what?! It was invasive cancer!  Thank God for my BS!  It is Stage 1, medium growing.  Who knows what would have happened 6 months down the road if he hadn't decided to take it out now instead of waiting.  You should get that lump out or at the very least biopsied.  Now, that is my 2 cents!
