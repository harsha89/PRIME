      "Content": "Musichetta wrote: Hey, everyone. So, I'm 23, with no previous family history of breast cancer/breast issues (at least on my mum's side, no idea about dad's. Asking him isn't really an option, and wouldn't help right now anyway). I was doing a self checkup on my boobs and found a small lump in the left one, which scared me senseless. Went to the doctor the following day, she did a checkup and said it was probably a fibroadenoma since she could feel it moving around, rather than it being 'rooted' to one place, but she could tell I was really worried, so referred me for an appointment at the breast clinic. At the time, knowing it was probably a fibroadenoma was a huge relief to me and I went away feeling reassured, but over the past few days the worries have started creeping back, mainly because my left breast has started feeling tender, and I've been getting the odd twinge there as well. It isn't localised (i.e. where the lump is), but it's a general feeling of tenderness throughout the whole breast, and the twinges will occur in any area of that breast. My right breast feels as normal as it always has, no tenderness at all. My mum suggested the twinges/tenderness might be because of my period - because she'd get sore boobs when she had hers - but I'm not having my period at the moment, and I've never previously had breast tenderness before/during my periods either. I did get the contraceptive implant, Nexplanon, inserted last December and had my last period in early January (not pregnant, just a side effect). The implant hasn't caused me any problems that I know of, but I'm just wondering if this could account for different experiences around the time my period would normally be? As in February (around what would've been my period), I did have a much higher increase in vaginal discharge than I've ever had before (no breast tenderness, though). Or maybe that the hormones released in my body might be affecting the possible fibroadenoma/whatever it is and making that boob tender...? Argh, I don't know. I don't know anything! I know the above paragraph is also just useless speculation that isn't really helping me right now, but my brain's going around in worry circles, alternating between 'what if?' and trying to reassure itself. I'm trying not to think about it too much, but it's hard not to when you're at home most of the time (mix of trying to make it self-employed/applying for jobs). At the very least I've got an appointment at the breast clinic scheduled for this Friday, hopefully they'll give me an ultrasound or something so I can at least have more concrete results. I know there's nothing I can really do until then, but I'm worried and guess I needed to vent these feelings out somewhere. Writing this stuff out helps, rather than just letting it fester in my brain. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Log in to post a reply",

I know that logically it's statistically unlikely this is anything to worry about it, but I'm a bit of a worrier by nature (especially about health issues), and sometimes it's hard to keep that in mind. I'm sorry you're having to go through a similar situation, too, having to wonder and worry about that for so long must've been awful. But I hope your biopsy and lumpectomy go well, and hopefully it'll turn out to be harmless. And thanks for the tip about that MRI! I'd forgotten that was also an option. If the ultrasound doesn't seem very clear, I'll try and push for it if I still feel unsure. Thank you :) And all the best to you.",

So I had my appointment at the breast clinic this Friday and the doctor gave me a physical checkup, said the same thing as my GP that it was probably a fibroadenoma or a benign cyst, but they weren't able to do the ultrasound that day, so I'd have to wait for the appointment date at the post. Will let you know how that goes *fingers crossed*",
