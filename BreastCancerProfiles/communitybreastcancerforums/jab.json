That operation could give me several more years on this good earth which is where I plan to stay for a good long time. Also, I would like to emphasise that there are many different kinds of breast cancer, some grow faster than others. You might well have a mets and not know it for a long time until it is diagnsosed due to pain or other problems which might appear unrelated. Proper treatment for better quality of life might depend on a proper diagnosis. I do agree that ovedoing the scans can be a health concern so this is something to watch, but information is not our enemy, the cancer is. Having had my BS tell me recently not to worry too much about that stage/grade thing (he almost didn't tell me...), this is a hot button with me, However, it has left me wondering, do dr's think we can't handle information when we ask/want it and so they put up additional barriers to get it when it might not be good? Last I looked I was made of more than sugar and spice and everything nice - Yup, we ladies are smart and have backbones too.",
