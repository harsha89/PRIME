My husband, who has lost a wife already and who is so devoted to helping me with this stupid cancer. 3. My mom and two MIL (they are best buds) because they don't deserve to loose anymore kids. 4. My entire family and friends because they are awesome. 5. Myself, because I want to enjoy some peaceful years traveling, relaxing and enjoying the amazing people in my life. Thanks, I needed that!",

I was lucky to find out when I did, apparently the addendum to the mastectomy pathology was stuck in the lab and did not show up in any of my files????Luckily I caught wind of it and with the help of the greatest nurse ever, tracked it down! So now I am 99% er+, 90$ pr+ and Her2+++, oh and BRCA2+....Guess I am just an overachiever:)  Weird pathology for lobular. Very excited to start perjeta, Herceptin and taxetore next week, FINALLY...I hope the delays have not allowed the cancer to wander further than my bones!  Every headache, stomach ache and my imagination runs wild!

My MO at Karmanos is Lawrence Flaherty, I would recommend him for a second opinion, Karmanos is a NCI. By the way, also my local MO is affiliated with McLaren. McLaren is located throughout Michigan and has just acquired or merged with Karmanos. I have not eliminated MD Anderson or UofM, however right how I feel I am on the right treatment plan.

Twelve years ago I was a very happily married woman with three kids age 3,6,9. My husband and I started dating the night I graduated from High School and got engaged the night I graduated from college. My husband, 39 years old, dropped us at the local campground where he was to join us after work, instead I received a frantic call from his work saying that he was having a \"seizure\", when I arrived my BIL told me that he had died, it was a sudden cardiac arrhythmia. I can tell you that the \"two become one\" part of wedding vows is very accurate and that the one that remains is no longer the same person and that a new person eventually emerges. After some time, a friend asked her brother, who had lost his wife to a cardiac arrhythmia two years earlier than I lost my husband, she was 34, to call me. We developed a friendship, mostly via instant messaging, he also had kids just older than my kids and we were busy. Eventually we started hanging out, as friends and somewhere along the line we wound up married. Blending these two families was not easy, mostly because we had slightly different parenting ideas, we made sure that our issues did not become the kids issues. What we have today is a sold, hard fought for marriage and five amazing kids. The extended families are all included whenever possible and my two mothers in law are best friends. We have two beautiful grandchildren that have a grandma in heaven and two grandmas on earth. I just wanted you to know that the love doesn't die and that we live in the people who love us. My life with my husband and my love for him are intact and are completely separate from my life with my current husband, the same is true for him and his late wife. We do not replace the kids lost father/mother, we just add a person who loves them. The point that I am really trying to make is that my late husband and his late wife are a part of us and our children and there presence is always there. I hope my story helps, now I have to go get ready to host Thanksgiving for 30 people from all four extended families, Jenny and Adam will be there in our silly stories and in our hearts.  Kim",

I finished taxotere 3/15 and had good scans for a year, however My tumor markers started slowly inching up after about 9 months and went above normal in June 2016. I had a pet scan in July and some of my bone mets were showing activity. My second opinion doctor said that the decision to drop taxotere after six rounds was arbitrary in the cleopatra trial and he keeps women on it until progression or until they are not able to tolerate side effects. I decided to go back on taxotere to get the most mileage out of my first line treatment (he didsay taht I could choose to go to the next line). The doctor said that breaks and dosage adjustments can help manage long term use. That being said, many women do well with h&p alone or with a hormonal. I think that I would discuss options for revisiting taxotere if h&p alone do not seem to be getting the job done. I have had two doses of taxotere since restarting, we dropped femara and I think that the joint pain from that was worse than the chemo side effects for me! Good luck with whatever you choose, Kim",
