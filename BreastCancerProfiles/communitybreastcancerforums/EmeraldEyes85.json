She examined my breast and found that they are extremely nodular, with some very pronounced lumps. She referred me for some blood test as well as and ultrasound. I am 28 years old, and have very dense breast, which is the reason for the ultrasound rather than mammogram. I went for the ultrasound on 30/07/2013. The technician felt the distint lumps by hand, but nothing showed up on the ultrasound.Â The report said no focal lesions or solid masses, but indications of fibroadenosis. It did also state that this study does not exclude malignancy. The conclusion was further management on clinical grounds as well as a baseline mammogram starting at age 40. My questions are: Why would it be that I can clearly feel the lump, but it can't be seen on the ultrsound? Is it possible that the radiologist added \"does not exclude malignancy\" to basically cover themselves? Or should further testing be done? My doctor is on leave until 16/08/2013, so I have to wait until then to get her explanation of the ultrasound. Any comments as to what could be going on will be welcomed! Log in to post a reply",
