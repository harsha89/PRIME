Now that I have reached the stage of hard to manage pain and needing more and more assistance from my husband, it is no longer so clear cut. Pain seems to have a way of taking away ones dignity.  I have a nice peaceful bedroom and a wonderful husband who is more than willing to take care of me, so you would think I could be happy to die here. The problem comes when I see the pain in my husbands eyes and I think it would be so much easier for him, if I went to a hospital.  So when comes the time when I have to weigh my comfort against the pain and discomfort it is causing my husband  ? Just rambling here, so many things go trough ones head during those sleepless nights.",

Since I am a bit in the same situation you are in, I thought it might help if I relay my solution to smart \"friends\" who where not happy with my housekeeping. Somewhere on the Internet I found the following wording \"If you are unhappy with the standard of housekeeping here, please feel free to make improvements\". I printed that in fancy lettering on a nice poster and hung it on the wall in my front hall for anyone who enters to see. I get a lot of compliments and laughs about my poster now but no complaints about my housekeeping. As to being hurt by your friend and her unkind words, even though I try to keep a sense of humor about my condition and the condition of my home, I would have to loose that friend. Sorry but neither of the two ladies would be in my life, we don't need that kind of negativity at this stage. We need love and cheer and as much pleasure as we can still find. If given the choice of using my energy to keep the house clean or wasting it going on a cruise, the cruise wins  hands down. with love Hilde",
