I am seeing my radiation oncologist tomorrow for the first time, and expect I will be starting radiation in April. I've been reading through the March thread, where I got a lot of good information. Still so many questions and uncertainty! Pleased to meet you all, though wish it was through other circumstances.",

      "Content": "Apr 3, 2018 07:26PM - edited Apr 5, 2018 09:28AM by poliwogli I had my simulation and got my 5 tats yesterday. The one in the side of my boob hurt, big time. The others weren't bad. I'm probably sensitive in that area. I will have 5 accelerated partial breast treatments every other day, starting April 17th. The RO said that everything looks good in my scan for the accelerated partial breast treatment, as the tumor site is far forward from my chest, which is one of the criteria. I decided not to take part in the study, which I'm a little sorry about since they are trying to find new treatment methods that make this easier for women. The trial selects participants randomly for either 3x or 5x. Both methods deliver the same amount of radiation, and I'm concerned about the higher dose during the 3x. I have a skin condition in the area which is unrelated to breast cancer, and worry that it will become worse. They seemed a little unhappy that I opted out, but said it's really up to me. They have been offering the partial breast 5 treatments to women with small, low risk tumors for many years now, so I feel more comfortable with it. With this method, they are finding that women don't show redness or burning during the treatment, but it might show up a few weeks later. They gave me Calendula cream to use twice a day. I was told I can lap swim (I'm a longtime swimmer), even on days when I have a treatment. We shall see! It does seem really incredible that 3 or 5 radiation treatments would do it, but they said that they have found it equivalent to the longer 3 week method that is becoming more standard.",

      "Content": "Jun 18, 2018 11:35PM - edited Jun 19, 2018 11:28AM by poliwogli Hello xcao, I am happy to share my experience with you. I just happened to log in tonight and found your post. I hope I'm not too late and that you see this. I was so anxious before surgery and at the beginning of every stage, so I know what you are going through. I got through it okay, though. Who is your surgeon? When is your surgery scheduled? I thought the Perlmutter center was very organized. On the day of surgery, I had to get there early for wire placement and a dye injection for tracing lymph nodes. The staff helped me find each place where I needed to be (on different floors), and they called a car to take me over to the hospital. They said they are required to drive patients over to the hospital, so you will probably have that as well. The hospital was a bit confusing and busy - you have to find your way up to the outpatient surgery area by yourself. But once there, the nurses are helpful. My surgeon was Dr. Amber Guth. She was very reassuring. After surgery, she recommended other doctors in her team. There are a few radiation oncologists at Perlmutter. I had Dr. Gerber. Also, Dr. Guth recommended my medical oncologist, Dr. Marlene Meyers. All my doctors are women, though there are men doctors there as well. I felt pretty good after I got home from surgery, probably still had painkillers in by system. The pain was worse on the third day, though, and I had some swelling. Advil helped more than the Tylenol/codeine they prescribed. I used an ice pack to bring down the swelling and it also helped me feel better. They didn't give me that instruction to use ice, I don't know why. I started radiation treatments 3 weeks after surgery. I had a very short course, just 5 treatments of 3D external partial breast radiation. A week before radiation started, they gave me three tiny tattoos on my back and one on the side of my breast for guiding the radiation technicians. The one on my breast hurt more than the others, but was not unbearable. It didn't take long, though. I didn't have any lines drawn on me. They used stickers to set up for the tattoos, but all was removed before I left that day. The first day of radiation was the most uncomfortable. I had to hold a position for maybe 20 minutes while they scanned me and got all the data they needed for the imaging. The platform I was laying on pressed on my rib cage and after awhile, it really bothered me. I didn't know that I'd be there that long and wished I had adjusted my position before they started. The other 4 sessions were shorter - about 10 minutes long - and not as uncomfortable. The radiation itself didn't hurt at all while it was happening. I didn't have many side effects, but by the fifth day, it seemed like I was developing a few little blisters. That lasted for a few days, but never did become burning or blistering. I didn't get a second opinion for radiation. Maybe I should have, but I decided to trust them and just move through the stages. So far, I feel good. Please feel free to ask me other questions, xcao. Hope all goes well for you.  ",

Okay, so I saw my ro for the first time today. My cancer was very early stage IDC, with clear margins and nodes. It consisted of two tiny tumors (1mm and 2mm) right next to each other. Because of that, the ro is recommending two options. The first is, 3 weeks of hyperfractionated whole breast radiation. The second is to take part in a study in which I would receive 5 days of partial breast irradiation or 3 days of partial breast irradiation at a higher intensity. The partial breast radiation targets the place where the tumor was. They think I'm a good candidate for the study. I would have an MRI every 6 months for two years - my tumor didn't show up in the mammogram or sonogram, but was seen on an MRI. I'll also be starting tamoxifen after radiation. They explained the history of both options, how long they've been doing it, what the follow up studies have shown, etc. Both are really short duration. The partial breast radiation delivers less exposure to organs, plus the skin side effects are easier, and the time is shorter. I'm concerned about a few things and looking for more information online.",

It's called external beam accelerated partial breast radiation and uses 3D imaging. It took about 20 minutes yesterday as they did the imaging first, then the actual treatment. I was really uncomfortable holding the position so long, it was straining my shoulder and neck. Afterwards, several radiologists came in to talk to me, and they showed me the 3D image on the computer and rotated it around. Kinda weird to see myself that way! The image also showed the beam path and how it is concentrated on where the tumor was, avoiding my chest wall and nipple. They gave me calendula cream to use. My skin is already pink, and I'm a little surprised that it's happening so soon. They said most women don't see any effect until a week or so after the last treatment. My skin tends to turn pink in that area anyway, and that's why I didn't want to be part of the 3 day trial. I go back tomorrow and will definitely ask about it. I'm having only 5 treatments, though, so we'll see. So far, I'm finding the Perlmutter Cancer Center to be very efficient and the people have been great.",

My scars are small and have almost disappeared already. Maybe you will have the short radiation treatment, it depends on several things. I could do light work in a week. They tell you to rest and you aren't suppose to do lifting or jarring activities, but I could definitely move around, cook dinner, etc. I was told I could go on walks as soon as I felt like it. I like to lap swim for my health, and Dr. Guth said I could swim again after 3 weeks, which I did without any problems. My incision had a clear kind of liquid bandage which had been brushed on. There were no stitches visible, I think there are stitches inside. After a few weeks, that \"bandage\" starts to peel off by itself. Radiation didn't affect my skin very much, but I did feel really bone tired by about 5 or 6 pm. I could work during the radiation treatments, but my treatments were only lasted a week and a half, every other day - which was not so bad. They gave me calendula cream for my skin, which I used twice a day. I only had a little redness and have had some local pains that last only for a second or two. I was told that the pains are normal and part of the healing. There is a team of doctors at Perlmutter that is researching shorter radiation treatments. The short treatments are offered to women with small early tumors and that have not spread to lymph nodes. Hope you can be part of that. I also had surgery on a Friday. A nurse will call the next day to see how you are feeling. They will give you instructions for taking care of yourself, but maybe ask about using an ice pack (wrapped in a small towel so it doesn't get too cold) in case you get swelling. It helped me a lot and was soothing. No need to apologize for your English, I totally understand everything you are writing. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Mar 29, 2018 04:13PM - edited Mar 29, 2018 04:16PM by poliwogli Hi ctmbsikia. Good luck and hope your next session goes well. I'll look for that article, thank you. My ro says that new guidelines, issued about a week ago, will mean shorter radiation for most everyone. Some good news, and hope it is implemented soon. Okkate, this process does move slower than expected, yes? You are so right about taking that leap of faith. Hopefully, once we start it will be less mysterious. My simulation is this Monday and I start treatment on April 16th. Hi Agatha, I'm being treated at NYU Langone / Perlmutter Cancer Center. Still thinking about the trial. The 5 day procedure has a longer track record, and seems that they are getting good results. The 3 day is newer. Since I would not get to choose, I'm a bit concerned about the shorter procedure. The oncologist told me that with the 5 day, women get through the week with very few skin issues, but mild side effects arise a few weeks after. They've seen similar results with the 3 day, but some women have more redness after two weeks, but if it happens, it can be treated. They are also comparing other side effects. I haven't seen anyone mention a body mold, sounds artsy craftsy! Let us know how that goes. Moisturizing now is a good idea, especially with the dry winter air. ",
