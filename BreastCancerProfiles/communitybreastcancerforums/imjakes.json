My last treatment was Christmas Eve 2015, 20 weeks ago, 140 days ago.... I have about 1/2\" on both sides of my head and right backside of my head. Top and left back are mostly bald with a few whispy, thin hairs. I use nioxin, take biotin and itWorks hair formula and lots of other oils and sups. My onco finally admitted I should have more hair by now and told me to see my gp because maybe they can prescribe something (I do NOT want another rx!) or check other possible causes, i.e. thyroid. Also, I've lost the majority of my eyebrows and a big patch oh my eyelashes in the last 2 weeks (18weeks after chemo!).  Anyone else experience this? I had 6 rounds of taxotere and carboplaten. I'm only 42, but at this point I need hair or shave what I have and embrace my bald. :(. (Picture is May 5",

In fact, the fda did not post anything about this possibility on their website until December 2015 which was too late for me, I was already 4 treatments in by then. 16 weeks pfc I questioned my onco about my lack of hair and he said \"be patient, I have never had a patient not get their hair back\". Lucky me! I get to be the first I guess. I'm now 22 weeks pfc and had to have my patches buzzed off this past weekend by my husband because it looked so terrible. I'm only 42 and trying to come to grips with this. I also don't want to line the pockets of lawyers, but I also shouldn't have to pay thousands of dollars, potentially tens of thousands because I don't want to be bald in my family photos, children's graduation photos, wedding photos, holding my future grandchildren etc. Sorry, this has all been running through my (bald) head today... I have to get it off my chest... ",

It's great to come on here and get it out :). Onco sent me to my gp to have blood work done to see if there was an underlying issue. All my blood work came back normal so now they're sending me to a dermatologist to look at the follicles, but that's not until July. Of course, they suggested Nioxin, but I've been using that for the past 5 months anyway. I'm also taking biotin, ItWorks hair, skin, nails, vitamin b12, and two other supplements my naturopath put me on; I've been rubbing coconut oil, sesame oil, cedarwood oil, lavender oil, peppermint oil, argan oil at night (I smell good! lol). I keep my head uncovered about 80% of the time so nothing is rubbing my scalp... And the list goes on.... I'm not sure if they can biopsy for hair loss? I will definitely ask the dermatologist!! ",

I really wish I would have done the taxol regimen instead of the taxotere, but I was not aware or told of the chances of permanent hair loss with taxotere!!",
