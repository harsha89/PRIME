      "Content": "rngdbdy wrote: I have a quick question for the experienced members--before your bc diagnosis, how often (if ever) did any of you experience that gnawing knowing feeling in your gut yet it turn out to be a false alarm due to (1) the test not showing anything or (2) the results coming back b9?  I feel like I am going insane to a certain extent.  Yes, I have had changes in my left breast (increase in size, 1 lump with increase in pain over the last year and 1 mass that has presented in the last 5 months, general achiness and sharp pain in that breast, nipple changes, all these big veins showing in the last few months).  I have \"exceedingly dense\" tissue and fibrocystic breasts, but this feels different from the norm even though mammos and u/s show nothing--not even the palpable masses that the docs can feel.  I've had this \"knowing\" feeling in my gut (I'm generally pretty intuitive) but my husband thinks I'm making a big deal out of nothing and the docs I've seen so far (except my GP who has been supportive all along the way) have left me with the impression that I'm concerned over normal changes and that's all there is to it--but these changes are not normal for me.  I've basically had to force my way to get any test that I have had done so far (with the help of my GP).  It has made me really question myself and now I'm wondering if I should just drop pursuit of anything else.  I have an MRI scheduled for 12/31 and am considering cancelling that.  Honestly, I'm feeling very self-conscious that maybe I'm just creating a problem that's not there.  And this gut feeling is driving me nuts and I wonder if I'm creating that as well!  Honestly, I don't feel scared or anything but more of a just wanting to know.  So, how many of you have had this experience of your intuition betraying you?  I appreciate any feedback that is offered and thank you!
