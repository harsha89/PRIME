I tried Tylenol, then Motrin, then Aleve. For me, Aleve worked the best. I had to take colace for constipation. I did get the neulasta shot day 2, which made me achy, but not unbearable. The decadron made me feel 'spacey', for lack of a better way to describe, which was unsettling. Blood counts were low at checkups this week, but nurse says that is normal. I don't have to go back until #2 on 12/11, so I am enjoying this little vaca. I cut my hair short to get the kids 'ready', but so far so good. I hope this helps. Hugs. clsd",

Anyhow, just wanted to reccomend a book I loved, Cancer Vixen by Marissa Marchetto. True story of a BC survivor, with amazing wit and humor. A total crack up if you want to keep it light... Paxton, I finally got my genetic test results yesterday, and they were negative, and I will pray for you to soon hear the same too. Keep up the fight Sisters, FUBC, xo Cindy",

One of your ladies recommended a site for friends and family to check in ( when I am in my chemo fog, I don't return calls, etc, ), and I wanted to say I have had such great success with  www.caringbridge.org   It is easy, and friends and family can leave you encouraging messages, with out your phone ringing 24/7, and repeating how you are feeling a million times . If you wanted to check out mine, feel free, just enter code   cldiaz. I wish  you a WONDERFUL and HEALTHY 2008, and BEYOND! Prayers and Hugs, Love Cindy NJ",

After my SNB, I too was so sore, and had really bad b.o., and very swollen. I finally figured out the smell was coming from my bandages/surgi-strips.......so I soaked them once my incision looked pretty well healed,  and they easily came off, and VOILA, no more nasty b.o !!! It takes me longer than the average bear to figure things out......I kept thinking, \" how can I reek so badly when I just showered an hour ago ?\"\" Also, I ended up having the bs drain the fluid from my armpit while in his office ( easy and painless). Swelling was then gone, and I felt much better ! D1, love the Frankenboob comment, I am lucky enough to be sporting one too! I am so impressed with your posts, and how strong you girls are, and some working ! You ladies Rock ! Sending wishes for a good day. xo Cindy",
