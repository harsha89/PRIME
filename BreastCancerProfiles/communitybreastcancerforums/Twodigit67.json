      "Content": "Twodigit67 wrote: Scared and uninsured here and need a shoulder from someone that understands. My daughter had premature twins 9 weeks ago and I stayed at the Ronald McDonald house with her while they were in the hospital (almost 4 wks). When my daughter would pump for the babies I would distract her other children by reading to them (one laying her head on my chest). After about 2 weeks my left breast just all of a sudden got very swollen and painful with red streaks. I thought somehow I was having some kind of sympathy for my daughter or been around too many breast feeding mothers and had somehow got mastitis. So I looked up home remedies and put cabbage in my bra for 4 days 'and it helped', the pain went away. Two weeks later I found a lump in my right breast just under skin in the areole. Though the lump does not hurt, I sometimes get very sharp stinging pains in both breast. The pain does not last long, but is definately painful enough to make me stop whatever I am doing till it passes. First symptom 7 weeks now, stinging and lump about 5 weeks. About 2 weeks ago my daughter told me she had a lump too. Hers is located in similar area to mine and a little smaller, but she has had no pain at all. Since she has insurance plus since pregnancy has temp medicaid to supplement it, I told her to go to the dr and if they said it was nothing I would get a little peace of mind about mine too. Well she went to dr today. She called me in tears upon leaving the dr and said that the dr asked her if she had any pain, when she replied no she was told that she needed to go to her ob/gyn and get another exam and probably a mammogram and that this dr was concerned. I never ever ever want either of my 2 daughters have cancer of any kind or for that matter, I never want them to be sick in any form. That being said now my daughter is mad at me. When she called me the first words she said was \"Well you should be fine because you have pain, but the dr is worried about me\". After 5 wks of my daughter saying Mom I'm sure it's nothing probably a clogged duct and dismissing my fears of course now I am really scared. I'm scared for her and myself. Unfortunately I tried to explain my symptoms to her and she just dismissed me again. And now she refuses to even talked to me, because I told her at least she has insurance and can get help. My husband and I make just enough money to get by, but not enough to provide me with his company insurance. And now it seems everyone I call for help tells me we make about $100 or so a month to much to get help. Where do I go from here? Right now I just want to sit in my house and say I quit and not even try to fight this battle. New here and trying to figure out where to post so bare with me please.  Log in to post a reply",

But honestly I have known every time something was wrong with me even if I didn't know what it was.  Like with my hysterectomy I knew something was wrong for over 2 years and I tried to tell my family I didn't know what was wrong, but THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG, I also think maybe I have a little denial going on, because I feel like I'm almost OK with this.  Not that I want this to be happening, but that if it is happening I'm OK.  I even laughed and told my husband he may end up with a skinny wife again, bald maybe but skinny.  And if it takes this happening to me to catch the same thing in my daughters early enough for them to be successfully treated than that is all I ask. ",
