      "Content": "May 24, 2012 01:15PM - edited May 24, 2012 02:31PM by fragrantroses Hi, I'm new to breastcancer.org.  I don't really know why I had not stumbled upon this.  I view theboobytrap.com regularly and an article about 3D nipple tatooing let me to this site. I did chemo, bmx with immediate TE placement, 33 rads and then Arimidex. My PS filled the TE as fast as he could because it all had to stop during the rad.  He would not resume fills/reconstruction until I was a year out from my last rad.  My rad began in Jan 2011, I was one of those who's skin totally dissolved away by day 21.  I had two WONDERFUL RO, who were supportive, compassionate and gentle.  When my skin began to tear then melt away they gave me narcotic pain meds to help cope.  We slathered silvadene cream on telfax pads to lay over the open skin and my bra days were over.  They actually changed their rad. plan to give my skin a chance to recover, they did the bolus boost which was way shorter.  Then they moved to a deep muscle layer rad which caused less damage.  The last week then the went back to the skin to concentrate on the incision line.  I am so grateful I never had issues with infection or some of the issues I have read about.  I still plan to procede with the TE for implant exhange, but around Feb began to notice that the rad. side had areas of stiff, STUCK skin.  In addition the TE seemed to be climbing up my neck getting tighter and higher.  I'm light skinned, so the whole axillary is a deep red, nearly purple.  But my arm pits haven't seen daylight in at least 15 years so the discoloration doesn't bother me.  The axillary swelling does.  I requested a PT appointment.  My PT is a breast ca recovery/lymphedema specialist.  She took one look at me, and told me I had fibrosis in that area that was stuck. She explained that the rad. can affect the skin's ability to heal, grow blood vessels for up to a year after rads, and that was why my PS refused to do surguries until that year was up.  She did deep tissue massage and taught me to massage at home.  She had my buy a big body ball and lay across the top of it in a kind of crucifixion position.  (Which I don't recommend doing in front of your spouse as the position was WAY too interesting to him.)  I was stunned by the stretch this did.  But I kept doing it.  She also did myofacial release, and over 6 weeks, my TE moved to the front were is used to be, and dropped.  The area around my shoulder where the Pectoralis muscle attaches was so tight it was like a cord.  It kind of hurt to have her doing the DTM and MFR but after chemo, surgery and rad?  What's a little hurt to stop me?  In addition, I bought what is called a swell spot from www.lyphmedemaproducts.com to wear in a bra over the rad side.  It channels fluid from under my arm and across the puckett.  It GREATLY reduced the residual swelling I have had since the tx.  She also recommended that I buy something similar to  dryer ball, the kind with nubs.  Trust me, you do NOT want to google bumpy balls!  Target carries what are called \"Sensory balls\" in the baby section that have nubs of different heights and widths for around $45.  I bought what is a galaxy ball from the obnoxious toy department...that area that has whistles, light sticks, and various other stuff your kids bug you about when they see them.  It cost $2.99 and any time I sit to watch a movie or tv, I am to roll that over all the rad. area...under the arm toward the front.  She said this will help reduce adhesions and fibrosis.  It's not a guarentee.  I actually waited 14 months to go back to the PS (my son was getting married and didn't want any hassles that would interfere with the wedding.)  When I unveiled my pucketts (named after the Dr who placed them) he exclaimed that I had done a marvelous job rehabbing the muscle and the skin for further reconstruction.  YAY us!  So he gave me a 60 cc fill right there and I have had another one since.  The non radiated side acts like \"bring it on\".  But I admit the radiated side gives me more discomfort.  After the second fill (brought me 600cc) I had severe muscle spasms.  But within 24 hours it was under control. I didn't know whether to post here or in the TE forum.  But reading what those poor ladies went through...ugh...I felt maybe this was a better place as my question deals with the rad effect and not really the TE.  I am wondering if there is anyone here who has completed reconstruction after radiation and was there any issues that popped up because of the rad?  Did your radiated TE get to the point that it refused to expand further?  After the exchange, how did your implant do on the radiated side?  Did it behave or move around your chest and seize up into a hard lump?  Is there something more I need to do to keep preparing this rad side for implants?  Any advice is appreciated.  Goodness this was long in the preview!  Sorry to be so long winded.  The PT did tell me to increase my intake of Vit E, so I did that.",

My PT said you said the same thing you heard.  Any time I am doing physcial activity, mowing, mopping moving things around, gardening I am to wear the sleeves.  I also have guantlets for my hands for when I sew.  If I was every to fly - which I won't know that I have a mastectomy with implants and breast prosthesis, I should be wrapped for the flight by a PT. Without actually looking at what you are calling a rash, I can't swear to it.  But I have sensitive skin.  And after a bit of wear, my skin will get itchy and when I break down and take it off, my skin is irritated looking.  I got pretty much the off the shelf Juzo sleeve, I think it was 20 - 30 % compression.  The irritation is from the weave.  This is the part I can't recall.  I don't know if the Juzo is a round weave and I need a flat or mine is a round.  But it had to do with the way the actual sleeve is made.  My pt looked at my skin and told me if I was going to have to wear the sleeves more often then I would need to go up a grade to the better, weave.  It wasn't as irritating to the skin.  Which is why I'm thinking the better weave is flat.  But it's also more money.  So I stayed with the sleeves I have and just am cautious to not have to wear them that often or that long. I can't swear that's what is going on with you.  Your PT would be able to look at it and tell immediately as mine did...it was not a reaction to the sleeve or an issue with my arm.  But how my skin reacted with the weave of the fabric.  I tried on one of HERS in the office and there was an obvious comfort difference.  So I wanted to advice you that there are difference kinds of sleeves with different textures.  It may not be your arm or LE that is causing the problem for you but the actual construction of the sleeve. ",
