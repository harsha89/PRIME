There is a research centre in Colorado focused on young women's breast cancer that has demonstrated a post partum diagnosis leads to different statistics than a group with the same stage, tumor biology but no kids or kids born more than five years before the diagnosis. The changes in the breast postpartum are thought to be driving distant recurrence at far higher rates. If you look just at the stage, this would give a very different picture. I have also read that each type of breast cancer (hormone positive, triple negative, her2) recurs with different patterns and timelines, so five years is really a random and uninformed marking point. May science move forward to the point where it is 100% for everyone, all ages, stages and biology.",

I work in an embassy, and live in a country where I can't get treatment (3rd world). So I faced the dilemna of not having friends or family (but am married with young kids) around to help out. In the end, we decided the stress of moving back to Canada - the pack-up, finding a doctor, a place to live, new schools etc was more stressful than staying put. I am travelling to Singapore for each treatment... which is a real pain. I am also on TC, so can speak to that and staying working. Not sure about side effects from the H part of TCH. I had my first treatment on a Wednesday, felt awful Wednesday afternoon and by THursday morning was starting to feel better. I was well enough to get on a plane on Friday (I was tired, but the nausea and dizziness was gone), and returned to work on Sunday (we have a Sunday - Thursday work week). I felt tired on Sun and Monday, but otherwise ok sitting at my desk. That's a bit different than running a classroom.... especially a primary school classroom.  So you might need closer to five days away to recover? I didn't need people to take care of me - I was really not that sick. But it will be lonely for you if you don't let people comfort and assist you. I found the \"not knowing what to expect\" with the first round quite intimidating, so emotional support was more the issue than physical support. I was walking around the house on Wednesday and Thursday, just felt dizzy and gross, but could make myself food, get water and so on. Definitely take help from your friends for that first round at bare minimum. And people will want to help you... If you have decent benefits and can take sick days when you need to, you could probably do it. The infection thing might be an issue, but maybe there is a way to manage that. Good luck. ",

I had a hairdresser come over to cut my hair at home with privacy, and wanted to keep my long hair but shorten it to shoulder length, then cut and style the wig to a similar shoulder length cut. This would have allowed me a seamless transition at work, and more privacy. But she decided to cut my hair short for whatever reason (I was an idiot and didn't sit near a mirror), so short it is. I was so upset last night, as it outs me on the wig. But today, I realized my hair as it was is gone. It ain't coming back for a while, and maybe facing that this week as opposed to when it actually falls will allow a gentle transition into the hair loss. My son was a bit shellshocked watching it all come off. The kids aren't crazy about this cut, wait til they see me next week:)  But then I can put on the long hair again...  I also think I am going to have trouble keeping the wig on - I have a pinhead as I call it, and even with the adjustable clips to tighten it at the back, it seems to slide around. So maybe wigs aren't for me... sickofpink and sfrey, i feel for both of you. But I also imagine your partners are more in love with both of you than ever, amazed at your courage and pluck and only to happy to be here for you now. BC tests relationships, but I am pretty sure it can also improve them if we allow our partners in on this experience. In the long run, this is a few months from a potential lifetime together. Let them spoil you silly. You deserve it.",

As a mom, it is hard to imagine the reaction your mom is having Jennifer. I'm sorry she isn't being the mother you need and deserve. So the blood test after neupogen shot four is fine - my neutrophils went from 70 to almost normal. Had I known that would happen, it sure would have saved me a heck of a lot of stress about the fever (I am a panicker). The ups and downs of this experience are what causes me the stress - I don't deal well with the unknown, and this is all one huge adventure into the land of no planning, no predictions, and no clue what next. This is what I am struggling with the most. Maybe round 2 will be more familiar territory, and while not better, less stressful. Or not:) My hair is still stuck firmly to my head - sounds like everyone else's started to fall after day 14, so I still have a couple of days left before mice appear in the shower:) Happy belated thanksgiving everyone, and hope for those who escaped work or SEs or whatever, that the shopping was therapeutic!",

Txjunebug - interesting your sisters don't want to know. They may find they worry all the time anyway, and not knowing about their genetic makeup does not keep fear that away. I suppose we all cope differently, and maybe their feelings will change over time. My younger sister died of cancer in her early 20's (totally unrelated type), and we were told it was genetic. But I always felt like it was this completely random thing, and so very unlikely to strike again. Maybe your sisters feel like if they don't know, they can assume that it will only affect you. Magical thinking really, but we all indulge in that.",

It was nice to be able to relax and sleep, but I may have overdone it with the lifting of kids on and off toilets etc. Anyone else experiencing this - I have redness around the scar in my armpit where I had the ax disection (but it isn't hot or swollen), and there are some red streaks radiating out that look like bleeding under the skin. I have some other huge bruises on my arms and legs, and I am not a bruiser at all, so am guessing I have stretched the scar tissue and bruised it and am bruising easily these days?? I am guessing, as I am back at home so can't contact my doctor in Singapore to ask. Anyone else getting bruises, or any redness around their armpit scar after exerting themselves?? My muscles are really weak this time, especially in my legs, and like many others, I have peeling numb feet so I can't feel them when I walk. I have iced my hands at each TC treatment, so the hands are still working pretty well. Fun times... not looking forward to #3 this Wednesday. The worst part last time was the nausea that set in once I started on the neupogen shots. Not as bad as post-chemo, just always there, driving me crazy. I ate pretzels all day for days. My 3 year old son with the hair fetish likes to pull my wig off and cuddle it to his face, stroking it!! Then he says, MOM!! Put your hair back on!!",

Nice that chemo is so full of little surprises:) But otherwise, round 3 seems pretty much the same so far. I also have buzzy feet and one buzzy finger (why just one??) but my mouth seems less pasty this round.   I am shocked at the cost of treatments and drugs in the US. $9000 for Neulasta?? Unbeleiveable!!!! I had to buy some Neupogen locally, which is far far cheaper than Neulasta to begin with, but in Singapore it is about Sing$1000 for 4 shots (about $800USD for 4, or $200 each). Where I live, for two shots, it cost USD$80 or $40 per shot. I would imagine that is close to the \"real cost\" as this was from a private hospital, and so would still build in a profit margin. Neulasta must be real money maker for some.... What are everyone's plans to celebrate the new year? We all have to do something special to celebrate being cancer free in 2013!!!!",

I live in a muslim country, so there are options in that regard for me... though I may get some strange looks for my sudden conversion. Despite my germ paranoia, and request to coworkers to give wide berth if sick, someone came and sat next to me yesterday to review something and then told me an hour later they were ill.

I don't want to be told i need IV antibiotics. I feel ok, so am hoping it is just the cold the kids all seem to have (of course). Also no clue what to expect from the blood count. The Dr at the cancer centre wanted a blood count on day 8, and the results aren't good, but maybe they are exactly as expected? Does anyone else get regular bloodwork to see how the neupogen is working? Did anyone have extremely low neutrophil counts (mine is 0.07 and it needs to get back up to 1.5 to do round 2 - but it is currently only day 8, which is the absolute low point, so is this normal?)

Holy steroid high today! I woke up with enough energy to lift a car. And instead, lifted my credit card and bought waaay too many xmas gifts for the kids. Problem was my short term memory was so shot that I would promptly forget who I had bought for and what, and price seemed silly through my drug haze, so this is going to be the xmas to end all xmases (and the bill to end all credit card bills...). Luckily the Canadian to Singapore exchange rate works in my favor... Expecting a bit of a crash tomorrow when all this wears off. Hoping to not get the horrible runs that some of you are suffering through. Ugh. I met a fellow Canadian in the chemo room yesterday. Very intrepid 70 year old woman who yelled a lot of advice at me:)  First person to talk to me in there so far - Culturally, the Singaporeans keep their heads down and don't look at anyone else while getting their chemo. It's a bit lonely, and I prefer the chatting. Makes the time pass by faster, and more of a sense of comraderie in this whole thing. Do you folks chat to your fellow patients, or is it quiet in the places you are all going to??? And for all those out there with itchy uncomfortable wigs, I agree. Wigs suck,but do allow some privacy and sense of normallacy if you can get past the annoyances of them. Wig tape solved my problem, no more sliding around. But scarves and bald heads are so much easier and sooo much more comfortable. Although I am not sure I would be brave enough to go bald in Seattle in December... I'm from Vancouver (and grew up in the north), and was always cold with hair and a good warm hat in December!!! Better days to all when you wake up - I am heading to sleep (if i can that is!!)",

I can barely climb a short flight of stairs, not because of being winded but because my legs are so weak. And even walking down the hallway at work leaves me feeling wobbly. They don't ache until I move - and then moving, rolling over in bed etc causes a wave of aches. Very weird, but actually not so bad as it doesn't bother me otherwise. Some of you sound like you are bothered by it all the time, which is hard.  Sickofpink - I heard Taxotere could make your eyes water all the time (heard it referred to as taxotear!) but didn't know it could block the ducts. The edges of my eyes are constantly itchy, so maybe all my scratching is keeping those ducts open:) I hope the thing the eye doctor did does the trick for you and you don't need stints... For the surgery first vs radiation first, I am sure that whichever way those of you facing this decide, it will be the best decisions for you both. The doctors wouldn't let you do it if it wasn't:) ",

I will stick around during radiation too - I really like coming in and seeing how everyone is doing. Everyone feels so familiar to me now.  So - I have 5 days of comments. Txjunbug, I can only imagine how frightened you are. I haven't been tested yet, and it would be my worst nightmare for either of my daughters to have it. But I would want them to know so they could be proactive and catch anything at stage 0 or 1 when it is practically curable. I hope your daughter's gene never amounts to more than a mutation. And that you can live with this worry as it could be a bigger one than your own worries. As mom's, we worry more about our kids than ourselves.  Michele - I am with everyone about finding the right therapist. Therapy can be amazing. I figure we all need it more than we admit:) To get back to the itching, I finally went to the ob/gyn and it was a very mild bacterial infection from low immunity during chemo. So on antibiotics and probiotics and all the pre chemo drugs. Crazy. Someone asked about the Canadian protocol. Not sure who. I looked it up on-line when I was first diagnosed, as it was mentioned to me by a canadian oncologist i consulted. I then asked two friends who underwent radiation in Canada, and they got what they were told was a standard five weeks. 50 geysers, over 25 days. If you have masectomy, it ends there, if you had a lumpectomy, they do boosters and it is longer. I had a friend ask her canadian oncologist this last week. I was today offered a 3 week or 6.5 week protocol, and couldn't get the Dr to tell me the difference, as 3 weeks does not seem to be the Canadian protocol - unless my Canadian friends in Canada didn't get the Canadian protocol for reasons specific to their cancers (one is stage 3, the other 2a, both are hormone positive, Her2 -). Anyway, the radiation Dr today told me cosmetic effects are worse with the 3 week (breast shrinking, burning) but I think that is bias as places wouldn't offer it if it shriveled up boobs like raisons. I would have gone for the 5 week protocol my friends got at home (I am canadian living overseas), but am uncertain about this 3 week one. So I seem to be signed up for 6.5 at this point. It is confusing. I would obviously rather have it over in 3 weeks, but only if I understand it is medically equivalent in terms of effectiveness and toxicity. If you get more info, let me know....",

And they put a woman beside me who was being treated for a recurrence five years out from TC. So a slight damper. I know it happens, it could be me, and she will be fine, but it was a damper.  Monstermom - welcome, and that leak sounded awful. I had read about that before starting chemo and so am curious. How bad did the burning get? Was it mild? Could you tell it was leaking? I had some burning today - shortlived and mild and figured it was nothing. Now you have me worried - I fly out of the country tomorrow and have enough paranoia in me I can see this worrying me... But you said it was rare, so I am just letting my imagination run wild after your description and the comment about yelling if there is burning:) Anyone interested in reading the results of a UK study on the effectiveness of a short (3 wk) radation therapy can find it on this link: www.medconnect.com.sg/tabid/92...   The study basically confirms that for up to 10 years, the survival and recurrence rates are the same for 3 weeks as for 5 weeks (no boosters included in the study, so if you get them, you are getting 3 plus 1.5 OR 5 plus 1.5). I was told today by my ONC in Singapore, it isn't 15 over 3 weeks here, but rather 18 over 3.5, so I am looking at 18 plus 8, or 25 plus 8. A one week difference. Still very confused as to what to choose.  Loafer - how's that research going?? ",

For those of you with younger kids - how much have you told them? I ask because I have told my kids, but my best friend didn't tell her kids anything (she had two under 5). She elected to leave and go to her parents house for the duration of her chemo to protect them from seeing her be sick, and also to give herself the space to rest and recover. My younger two don't get it, but the 10 year old does. She seems to be quite ok with it all. For those who had a choice, how did you decide whether to go lumpectomy or masectomy?

For this reason, the onc told me it was essentially equivalent to the TC, which is 1-2% less effective than ACT or FEC, but easier on the heart and less risk of other cancers. Might interest you to know that according to her, the big benefit came from the hormone therapy for those est/prog positive. She walked me through adjuvent online, that risk projection tool for cancer - and showed how if she put in my stats (age, tumor size, grade, node involvement) and then clicked the various chemos (we did it for each of the three choices), there was no difference in the prognosis or recurrence rate. Overall, the combined benefit was the same.  You could ask your MO to do the same if they haven't done it with you already, and you find comfort in that kind of information. I found it useful and reassuring. When this question came up last time, a few other people on this board had gotten similar advice about ACT vs TC question.

Fell asleep and they left me there, so not sure when it was actually over...!! It was smooth as silk, no allergic reaction this time, which was my boxing day gift. Flying on christmas day will now give me something to be thankful of on all those xmas down the road when I get to stay home and EAT and not fly for chemo:) We (MO and I) talked about radiation today, which made me feel like this is now winding down, even if it is just over the halfway hump. And got the good news that the bleeding around my armpit scar is not anything bad, just a sign of overdoing. So 5lovebugs, yes, the potty is it!! And then I met some folks travelling from Bangladesh to see my Dr, which was interesting. I asked what kind of cancer the patient had, and her family took me aside and explained they aren't telling her she has cancer... major cultural difference. Can you guys imagine your families meeting the doctors and NOT telling you that you had breast cancer? So interesting... I felt badly for outing her cancer to her, but perhaps it will help her in the long run. We stood and chatted about the stage she/they are at (diagnosis) vs what it feels like post surgery to be in it and moving forward. The drugs made me ruminate on how we all move through that stress, grapple with our questions about why and how and when, and then move on. I am not sure I like calling it a \"journey\" when it feels more like a forced march, but it is a process and looking back with them was very interesting for me. I realized I am more positive and ok with this than I often feel like I am. Hope everyone's christmas and boxing days were wonderful. Eleni, I hope TC is easier on you than FEC. Maychen - how was the surprise reunion?? Sickofpink, I was told the lowest immunity days for TC were days 7-10, but if you are on neulasta, that should helps at lot. I am sure you are safe to eat out for dinner. Just wash your hands frequently, keep a six foot radius from anyone with a bacterial or viral infection, and I got this tip from an infectious disease specialist I met in Bangladesh - wash your nose out after outings with a mixture of salt water and baking soda (with a little syringe, leaning your head back so it flows all the way up there) and you should be fine. I think the risk is probably lower than our fears of the risk. I have been paranoid too.. and am now realizing I can do more than I thought I could given my sick kids haven't made me sick... I went on holidays after round 2 with the family, and flew on day 7, ate out daily until we returned home from the holiday on day 18. Eating at home is a lot of work for you, so perhaps more stressful and tiring than a meal out at a nice restaurant??  ",

I know its the steriod high, but underneath is a happiness that in a week of side effects, it's just ONE MORE TO GO!! And that feels so exciting, like the end of this stage is in sight. I have lost my energy for the things that are supposed to make this easier (can't stand to drink the gross tasting water, so am slacking off and I know that is no good....). I was so happy that I didn't have the sensitivity reacton to the Taxotere and so was out of there in 3.5 hours instead of over 7. What a difference that makes. Back home tonight, so also am happy that the time away from home was minimal this time. The MO and I also discussed radiation which was exciting - to look forward to the 3rd and final phase of this part of the treatment. My Rad Onc appointment is Jan 14th, and I am booked to start Feb 18th for 6.5 weeks.... which is a long haul to be away from the family. I can look into a return to Canada for those 6.5 weeks, but am not sure that is any better as at least the kids can come to Singapore a little more cheaply than Canada, which would cost us an absolute fortune. But I have an option of a free condo in Victoria, which would be a very lovely way to pass the time (lots of friends there, parents two hours away). Hard choices... On the topic of radiation, are any of you Canadians out there doing the \"five week\" Canadian protocol instead of the standard 6.5 week protocol? If so, I would like to know more. My MO told me I could opt for it here, but I want to know exactly what the Canadian protocol is and what kinds of BC patients it applies to before cutting 1.5 weeks of radiation from my treatment, just in case they would make a difference in my recurrence chances or not. So far, only a handful of us have mentioned radiation, but I would guess a chunk of us are heading that way when we are done. For those on AC followed by T - good luck - I hope all of you find your \"T\" portion to be a breeze and get a good break. And for those fuzzy headed folks like our granny clarabel, I have the fuzz too. Look like I did when I was two and had orangutang hair. I trust these stubborn hair colleagues are the northern relatives of the very few remaining southern clan who refuse to give up the ghost, and that it has no relationship to my \"rogue\" cancer cells which are all now dead and gone. I have also noticed stubble growing in between treatements - yay!! Sickofpink- good luck with the dinner. Ordering in sounds wise - relaxing, comfortable, and no worries about catching something. Enjoy!! Macychen - glad you had such a good visit. By the way, was reading all the phamplets at the MO's office yesterday waiting for my patient and there was a good one on stageIV. This clinic was saying they manage it more like chronic disease, and have seen excellent improvements in treatment for this group. I thought of you as I read it - and my aunt is one of the patients at 10 years this xmas who falls into this group. I am sure with your boxing gloves, attitude, and family love and support, you are well on the road to beating this uninvited body guest out of your life. ",

I kinda want to get it over with. My 3 year old son is obsessed with my hair and always has been. He puts himself to sleep by touching it, and whenever he is near me, he puts his hands in my hair. He isn't going to be happy with a bald head, but maybe he will move his obsessive compulsive hair stroking on to someone else in the house for a while (which will be great on the nights he comes to our bed, it is a realy sleep disrupter!).

As Tlym  said above, I was told there were marginal benefits to FEC/ACT over TC (under 1%), but they are also a bit harder on the heart so basically that evens everything out. I saw two MOs, and one kindly picked up the phone to call a friend MO in Toronot Canada to see what i would be offered at home in Canada (I was in Singapore) and the third also said any of the three were equally good.

I haven't been tested yet, will do it this summer because I have a family history. I was told that the regular MRIs will ensure that any recurrence is found early and is still entirely treatable - for a canadian, the only bonus in testing positive is that it means MRIs are covered. For those whose steriods caused zits - I wondered what that was!!! I broke out immediately after treatment, and thought it was the chemo. Steriods huh... go figure.",

Bea - the \"to chemo or not to chemo\" is a hard one given your situation. For me, it was easy as I was node positive and the tumor grade of 2 was fast growing enough that I was told the chemo would kill any cells left behind by surgery and be of positive assistance in preventing a recurrence. Can you get a second opinion? It might help you decide. Chemo isn't easy, but if it has clear benefits, then obviously totally worth all of the aches and pains and hair loss in the long run. \"clear benefits\" is also a very personal things, for some that would be 3% and for others it wouldn't. As for your doctor's comment about side effects, mine said the same thing and I am not sure that I agree with them!! There is a definite impact on most people's lives during chemo, even with the arsenal of drugs we are given. It is quite do-able, and if there is no choice, well, you have to do it. But the drugs definitely don't take away all the side effects to the point that life is normal during the course of the treatments. Good luck with your decision. Alison - my head started tingling, the hairs started dropping, and they were all pretty much gone within 7 days. Everywhere. Fun times:) I brought out the wig for work today, and lots of stares but everyone was scared to comment so I had to break the ice and crack some jokes. Cancer can be so awkward (for other people).

Because of the full mobility, my surgeon thought they would go away but is now suggesting a physiotherapist - I am curious if anyone else has experienced this and if the physio successfully dealt with the cords. How are all you \"just finished gals\" celebrating life after chemo? Did anyone do anything special, or are all too tired?",

A little bit of information that I don't understand usually sends me into panic zone, so feel better based on your experience. Of course, now I am worrying that because the only SE I got from the neupogen was this crappy rash, it wasn't working:)  Good luck with your next round.",

I am avoiding raw fruit and veggies til the end of chemo given how dirty produce is here. The last thing I need is a stomach bacteria or the runs, so V8 and frozen fresh fruits and veggies are my friends. I miss salad.... Anyone else experiencing insomnia?

I will be thinking of you and hoping that your RBCs hang in there. I did 4 X neopgen this round, and after 3 shots my neutrophils were critically low (0.07) and then I got a fever. The antibiotics worked, but I have to talk to the MO about increasing the shots or doing something differently, because it was stressful living in a room alone (kids were all sick) for three days worring about getting sick and having to go to hospital here. He said some people only need 2 shots - Marian has done anywhere from 5 to 7, someone else on here did 4 like me. Seems like another thing where every person is different. Someone asked about work. Aside from the immune system issues, I have been well enough to work from home and in the office when the WBC count was high enough almost every work day since the day after chemo. I am being given a lighter load, but it is manageable so far. That may change if things get harder with each chemo. But again, everyone is different and you probably can't bank on being able to work, nor assume you won't be able to. Just another thing to take as it comes...",

We all hope the spots are nothing, but are here to offer support to you as you wait to hear what all this means. Michele - I really hope you feel better soon. We've had short discussions on here about bravery, and how women facing breast cancer have no choice but to be brave. But there is a choice. What is brave is plugging ahead with treatment when you continue to feel as bad as you do, after having already done this before, and yet still you keep going, even though you feel like you can't. That is brave. I hope that tomorrow you are better, so that all of this gets a tiny bit easier for you.",

It seems like an emotional thing like Skimommi said, and will be a marker of some sorts when it happens. Both to feel well enough, and to not be weirded out by it all. We've been together for 17 years - since our early 20's - so maybe that also takes the pressure off? Depressingly, my friend who has started tamoxifen last fall and is just over 40 told me how painful sex is now due to the drug. With the studies out this week saying tamoxifen is better if given for ten years (everyone is very helpfully telling me about this), I feel like BC may have changed this part of my life permanently.   For people who have slippery wigs - I bought wig tape. It is excellent. It sticks it right in place, and it allows me to loosen the wig clasps so i don't have to have it quite so tight to hold it in place - and the headache went away. I don't like wearing it though - find it really uncomfortable. It is going to be extremely uncomfortable in the heat, so am really hoping there is a bit of hair when things heat up in the spring. My right eye's lashes are mostly gone. No sign of brows thinning. Anyone else losing lashes or brow's yet? ",

Perhaps it gets worse than that? I did read for some people it can take a significant amount of time to wear off, and for others, it goes away right after the last chemo. Someone told me that until recently, very little attention was paid to the cognitive impacts of chemo and so it is not well researched or even really understood. This website has a research and articles section, maybe there is something good in there. Tell us what you find out:)",

I had mine between chemos - two days before my third chemo treatment so all side effects would resolve and wouldn't get confused with fever following chemo. I was fine, had no problems with the flu shot and feel safer flying and going into airport crowds where people are sneezing and coughing like crazy. I also wear an N95 mask on flights (I fly for chemo) - this mask is not available in many drug stores, so you have to ask for it. It is the one that you need to protect you from small particles like viruses. It is a bit embarassing to wear, but seems to have kept me healthy when kids are sick, or on flights. They are cheap - about $3 a mask. And are reusable. ",

I have found this so difficult, and can't even imagine what it would feel like if the cancer came back and I was in your shoes and was finishing up my second round of doing chemo. Anyone being treated for breast cancer hopes like hell the first time is enough.  We lose our faith in our health when we are diagnosed. And then we have to fight to find the  faith that it worked and we will be ok. We are all terrified of a recurrence. I can only imagine that when the cancer comes back and you have to undergo treatment a second time, when that fragile faith that the treatment \"works\" has been dashed, moving forward again is in a whole new world. If you need to cry, cry. Bottling it all up sure won't do any good, and once it is all out, follow 5luvbugs instructions! We all should do what 5luvbugs says at least once a day.
