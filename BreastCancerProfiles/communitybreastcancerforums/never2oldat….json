We have been told that too and my daughter hangs on the words 'we can treat you', she does not think further or if she does she doesn't tell me, she is amazing and so positive. I'm the one that if I think too hard about it all I go to a very dark place and it's not nice... lizdehart we are going to get that test done as I also have a another daughter who is 19 and it puts the fear of god into me when I think about it.
