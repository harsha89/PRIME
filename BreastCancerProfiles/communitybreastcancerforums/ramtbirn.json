      "Content": "ramtbirn wrote: Hi, This is my first time posting, but have *lurked* for awhile. Anyway, I'm writing in regards to my future mother-in-law, Linda. A bit of history, she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 (before I met her or her son), had lumpectomy & lymphectomy, not sure about chemo, but I think she also had radiation. In 2006, her oncologist found mets to the bone (sacral area). Over the course of the next 18 months, it spread to several vertebrae, ribs, humerus, both femurs, and hips. Linda REALLY likes her oncologist and feels like the onc really listens to her. I've gone with Linda to a couple appts in the past month and also like her onc. Dr. P evaluates Linda's pain on a weekly basis and recommends pain med adjustments accordingly. Now, the area I don't understand: Linda's unwillingness to take the pain meds. Her onc has talked to her, I've talked to her, and her son has talked to her. We've all explained that addiction is totally different from tolerance and Dr P even told her yesterday that addiction is not even a concern at this stage of things-a quality of life is. She IS doing a Fentanyl patch, but won't take more than 3 Vicodin a day for breakthrough pain. (In nursing school we were taught that metastatic bone pain is unpredictable and basically, the worst pain imaginable.) I am hoping that someone here can explain her behavior to me, because I can't understand it. With all the options out there to help with pain control, why would someone refuse to do more to help alleviate the pain and potentially improve her quality of life? (I really hope I don't sound b!tchy; I really care about and love Linda and the nurse in me just wants to improve her quality of life. I've supported every choice she has made, but I'm having a hard time with this.) Log in to post a reply",

I can understand about not wanting to feel groggy and choosing pain over that, but when she is sitting at the kitchen table in tears b/c of the pain-I wonder what kind of QOL she has then. I fully support her decision not to take pain meds, but when she has a short temper, cries, has sharply limited her ADL's (activities of daily living) is when I start to speak up. The worst is that she's not being honest with her doctor. Yesterday at the appt, after Linda basically told Dr. P she's feeling \"tough\" but \"ok\", Jeremy (her son) spoke up and told Dr. P of his observations. Dr P told Linda (again) about addiction/tolerance and met bone pain and QOL. ( I did keep my mouth shut at the appt, though.) Thank you for all your help, Rach~ ",
