It was scary while I was going through it and knowing they were there was tremendously helpful. Plus, they were able to help me make a decision about my next steps and then drive me home and stay with me to make sure I was well the rest of the day. Because I was not feeling well, my husband was also able to explain to our children what happened and keep them out of my way while I rested. It was not the best way to start my treatments but despite that, I'm still feeling that this is the best course for me and that I can get through this despite all the bad stuff that may come with it. As someone posted earlier, I want to be around for my son (9) and daughter (11) and these treatments will help make sure that I will be. YOU CAN DO IT!!",
