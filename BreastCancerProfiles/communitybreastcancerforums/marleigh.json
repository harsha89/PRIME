      "Content": "Sep 28, 2017 09:15AM - edited Sep 28, 2017 09:20AM by marleigh Hi everyone. I found this forum last month after my diagnosis but I forgot to come back and sign up my membership. I just had my surgery last week so thought I would come post my experiences in case it might help others ISO info on the topic My pre-op was one week prior to surgery, which included lots of medical history questions, blood work to insure I was healthy enough for surgery, and a chest x-ray. I did not have an EKG - my BS said she does not order one unless the patient has had a known history of heart problems or had been experiencing heart related symptoms recently (shortness of breath, chest pains, etc).  The day (late afternoon) before surgery I had to have radioactive tracer injected. I had read countless articles on the internet about this and everything pointed to blue dye being injected. Most everything I read left me terrified it was going to be horrific pain. By the time I got to nuclear medicine for my appointment I was so amped up with anxiety I was about ready to just explode. When I got to the back for the injection, the tech asked me if I knew what was about to happen and I told him I'd read about the blue dye so kinda knew. He told me to relax because they had not used blue dye for several years and that this was radioactive tracer and that it should not be that painful. My injection included two shots of lidocaine (into each breast) then immediately followed by the tracer (two shots) into each breast. One shot was on the side of each breast nearest the arm and the other shot was on the top. Each shot was about 1/2 inch from the nipple. The only pain - which was nothing worse than a normal little needle stick - was the lidocaine shot when he first inserted the needle. I didn't feel anything from the radioative tracer shot. Then I had to wait for the tracer to find the sentinel lymph node and he could get a picture with his camera. In total time I was there about 50 minutes but most of that was just waiting for the tracer to light up the nodes for viewing. I felt no pain after this procedure. Morning of surgery I had to be there at 5:30am for 7:30am procedure. I got called about 5:40am. After being called, they put me in a private room to change clothes and I could watch TV. In that room, I changed into my gown, hat, socks, put my clothes in the bag (belongings bag), and they started an IV and began asking about 50 medical history questions (most of which I'd already answered in other settings!) When I met my anesthesiologist (about 20 min before surgery) I asked her to give me something for nausea just to make sure I wasn't sick (because I didn't want to spend the afternoon/night throwing up) and she ordered a Zofran shot into my IV plus a patch behind my ear. They worked as I was not sick at all. My BS came by about 10 min prior to surgery to see me and make sure I was ok and reassure me that everything would be fine and see if there were any last minute questions I had An anesthesiologist assistant came in after the BS left and told me briefly what would happen via anesthesia. He said he was going to give me a shot to relax me and that I would probably be asleep before they even began the anesthesia in the OR. He was right - about 15 seconds after they began pushing me to OR I was out. So I don't remember anything at all about the OR. Next thing I remember is waking up in recovery. My surgery finished around noon. I got out of recovery and into my room at 3:30PM I did not have any pain while in the hospital that required pain killers. I was attached to an IV where they ran an antibiotic bag (I wasn't sick, it was a preventative type thing) with the regular IV. Nurse showed me how to press a trigger thing to get pain meds if I hurt. But I never did. Only thing I had that bothered me was a sore throat and lots of phlegm in my throat. One of the nurses said both were from the breathing tube and that it would go away. It didn't go away until Day 2 after surgery. It bothered me so much the first night I tried to get them to give me something but they couldn't because there was nothing left on my orders from Dr. Soon as I got out of the hospital, we stopped at a pharmacy on the way home so I could get some Halls cough drops. It was the phlegm that drove me nuts, not the throat pain (which was minor). I asked for ice chips during the night and it helped tremendously with the phlegm. So I'm currently Day 7 post surgery. I have slept in a bed the entire time (I don't mean I've been in a bed the entire time, I just mean when I slept at night it was in a bed). Just prior to surgery I went to a Walmart and bought me 4 standard bed pillows. Turned out 4 was too much and I only needed 2. I just needed a little propping up so that I was able to get up by myself. Since I had bilateral mastectomy I couldn't push up with either arm. But I was able to sit up on my own just using my stomach muscles (like you do when you're doing sit-up exercises). First 2 days were the hardest to get up, Day 3 much easier, and by Day 4 I was able to get up/down with normal speed.  My BS started me on exercises Day3 after surgery. They are hard! But I'm making progress. I am also on a 10lb weight lift restriction. I have 3 drains. They are not painful, just a nuisance. Am hoping they come out tomorrow (29 Sep) I also wear a compression tube around my chest. I don't know how long I will have to wear that but will find out Friday 48hrs after surgery I was able to remove the bandages and take my first shower. I had to put fresh bandages on, as well as the compression tube back on. During the shower I had to pin my drains to a lanyard I bought 3 mastectomy shirts from a place online called \"pink pepper company\". The woman that owns the site is a breast cancer survivor and she makes the shirts herself. What is awesome about these shirts is there are inside pockets to put your drains in. I know a lot of people just pin their drains to the inside of their shirt but I just didn't like that. For me it's so nice to be able to put the drains in a pocket and forget about it. I also bought a special chest pillow from there to help with the car seat belt. Since I've been home I've only taken Alleve for some minor pain.  My driving restrictions were just no driving until 24 hrs post-strong pain meds. As I have not used any strong meds, I have not had to worry about that. I have been driving around just fine all week. I do not know yet what is in my future because I have not met with an oncologist yet. I am supposed to get that referral tomorrow when I make my post-op appointment with BS. So I don't know if I will have chemo (my guess is that I will) or radiation or both or just skip and go straight to the Aromatase inhibitors   ",

The week before my surgery I had pre-op and my BS's nurse gave me two small heart shaped pillows.  She said they would be good to put under each arm to use for awhile to keep me from rubbing the incisions with my arms (both incisions go under my arm pit).  These were donated from a different women's group at another local church. I didn't know I was going to be given any of these pillows so I ordered a mastectomy pillow from the \"pink pepper company\" - same place I got my mastectomy shirts. I have used each pillow for different things. During the early days of my mastectomy (when I still had drains) I used the pillow from pink pepper. But the pillow I use the most is the small rectangular pillow. For me seatbelts irritated my chest even after the drains came out. Then when I got the port I then needed a fresh reason to use a pillow to keep the seatbelt off me. So overall the small rectangular pillow has been my go-to pillow. In hindsight I really didn't need to buy a pillow (because I had all of these given to me) but unfortunately nobody mentioned to me I would be getting pillows and I didn't think to even ask. But you will need some kind of pillow to help you with the seatbelts for sure.",

I was just so ready for the actual radiation treatments to begin. My RO made me wait 5 wks post-chemo before he would begin because he wanted all  of the Taxol out of my system. I thought the 5wks would never pass.  AgathaNYC - good luck tomorrow with your simulation! I have completed 5 treatments. Everything is still fine, no SEs yet.  Today I did a count in my head each time the beam was on. I counted to 20 on each. I don't believe it was an actual 20-second count (I was too fast I believe) so I would say the beams go for about 15 seconds each, maybe even less. So it's 45 seconds max total (3 angles) in treatment time for me. ",

No fatigue, no color change in the area, no itching, no pains, still cruising along just fine. I hope this trend continues.  Congrats kaywrite for finishing your treatments!! As for the hormone therapy, my OC put me on Anastrozole (generic Arimidex) exactly 4 weeks post chemo. I was worried about taking it along with Radiation because I didn't want two different new things going on (Anastrozole + radiation) and not be able to differentiate between which one might be the culprit in the event SEs popped up. But I have not had any SEs from the Anastrozole. So good luck with your hormone therapy, hope you have great luck and no SEs.  ",

      "Content": "Mar 30, 2018 10:41AM marleigh wrote: Hello everyone - I decided to join the April group. My radiation actually started yesterday but since it's only two days in March (yesterday and today) I came here. Since I've started, I'll go ahead and post what my experience has been thus far. I've been reading the other treatment threads and it's amazing how different the ROs are from patient to patient! DIET: My RO said I don't have to be on any kind of special diet, no increase in protein, etc. Just to make sure that I eat a balanced diet. SOAP: My RO said there was no special soap I had to use. However, I am not to wash the area with a washcloth. Just put soap on my fingers and gently go over the area. Then take a soaked washcloth and squeeze the water over the area to rinse it. Never to face the shower, instead I am to put my back to the shower. I thought liquid soap would be best for this process rather than bar so I bought some liquid Ivory soap. Even tho he said it didn't matter about soap I still decided to go with a mild soap for that area. CREAM: I am to use Lubriderm in the morning after my shower and then Aquaphor after treatment (when I get home) and then at bedtime. Since the Aquaphor is so greasy I bought some men's 100% cotton t-shirts from Walmart to wear when using it - thus I sleep in that shirt as well. If these don't work, they will give me Miaderm (they provide it, I don't have to buy). My RO feels very confident in the Lubriderm and Aquaphor and said he rarely has to pass out Miaderm. TATTOO: My center does not use tattoos. Instead they marked with a magic marker then put tape over that. They said they have not used tattoos in several years. DEODORANT: On the side I'm getting treatment, I am to use pure corn starch. No deodorant whatsoever. I can use deodorant on the other side if I want to, but not the treatment side. PROCESS: the way mine goes is: I check in at the main desk when I arrive, but I don't have to go into the main waiting room anymore now that treatment has started. Instead, after check in, I go straight to the women's dressing room, change into a gown, then sit in a women's-only waiting room (which is very small, only 4 chairs and a TV are in there). I was in the women's only waiting room about 10 minutes. I wear glasses, a ring, and watch and don't have to remove either of them. Nor do I have to take off my shorts (it's warm here now) or shoes, just wear the gown, turn it around to open in front so that I can easily remove my arm for the treatment. My legs were propped up at the knees, and I put my heads over my head - each hand held onto a handle (like a bicycle handle). They did 3 different treatment positions with the machine and the whole process took about 10 minutes. Most of the time was them setting the machine to how they wanted it, putting a bolus on, walking in and out etc. I didn't pay a whole lot of attention to time in as far as actual beams from the machine but guessing it was probably about 2 minutes total of actual treatment.  My RO said most of his patients experience some fatigue and redness. Most of the redness complaints are in the armpit area due to the fact there is friction there from you moving your arm as it rubs against your body plus the friction caused from a shirt.  But he said he has a large percentage of patients who have zero fatigue (hope I fall in that group!). But all of them have some degree of redness he said. This morning I have no signs of redness yet, but I know it is coming of course. My treatments are every afternoon. I will have 35 treatments so I have a long way to go.  I am soooo ready for all of this treatment to be done! ",

My MO has already started me on B6 and B12 to get ahead of neuropathy to either prevent it totally or lessen the symptoms. He said if these don't work sufficiently he will put me on L-glutamine next. If neither of these work then I will go on some prescription meds that are specifically for Neuropathy (but I can't remember what he called that drug) My MO also has given me my prescriptions but they are only Zofran and Ativan.  I specifically asked why not Compazine and he told me he doesn't use it anymore but he didn't say why.  So here we go - all of us Nov chemo sisters will fight this monster together side be side and reach the light on the other side of this road bump we have come across.

The nurse told me I had to stay in there at least 30 min even tho I was awake because it was standard policy for that hospital in order to make sure I was ok. Then they pushed me back to my room where I had started from (where I changed into the gown, etc,) let me go to the restroom and put on my regular clothes, and they monitored my vitals for about 20 or 30 min making sure my BP was ok.  After they pushed me via wheelchair out to the car, we circled back and re-parked and went back inside to eat at the hospital cafeteria because I was starving and I live 30 min from the hospital and didn't want to wait till I got home. I felt kind of foggy headed rest of the afternoon and went to bed about 7:30.  My surgeon had prescribed me Oxycodone Acetaminophen to take but I didn't need it. A little after midnight I woke up with MINOR pain from the procedure and took 2 Tylenol (over the counter) and it controlled the pain. I have not had any major pain from the port at all. Friday I was aware the port was there when I turned that arm or my head a certain way but nothing bad.  Today I don't even feel it at all and other than seeing the bandage I wouldn't know it was there.  Since my chemo starts Wed my surgeon told me to just leave the bandage on until then.  I have been able to shower with it just fine the whole time. ",

She told me if I still had some pain even with that to use Tylenol. If these two together don't help then to call the office.  I will be drinking Enterade. The nurse gave me a free starter pack.  My pre-meds will consist of Zofran, Emend and Decadron This infusion center provides water, snacks and lunch. I can bring my own drinks/foods if I want to as long as what I bring doesn't give off a strong smell since some smells trigger nausea in many patients We went over the GI issues. Over-the counter Imodium and if it doesn't work then prescription Lomotil. For Constipation, they recommend stool softeners first, gel suppository second, and Smooth Move Tea or Mirilax third. If neither of these work then call the office We went over nutrition briefly but they provided me all kinds of \"what to eat\" in my notebook to read. I haven't read that yet but will today/tonight She discussed what they would be looking for in the blood work There's a lot more she went over but like I said it was information overload. I tried to take notes and thankfully she provided her info in a vinyl notebook they gave me because I couldn't keep up with it all just with notes.  Tomorrow is my first day of chemo so I know my anxiety will increase hourly till then but I just want to get this started so I can get it done!! Prayers for everyone who has already started their treatment and those about to start. We can do this!  ",
