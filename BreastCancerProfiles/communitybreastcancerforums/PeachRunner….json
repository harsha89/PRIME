I had my annual mammo last month where they find tightly clustered microcalcifications too. I was a wreck; in a panic. Then they did a magnified mammogram on me a few days after that; still undetermined, and so they suggested a biopsy. That scared me. So IÂ  did a stereotactic biopsy a few days later. I got my results within 48 hours; benign. Fibrocystic breasts. Best of luck!! Praying for B9!!!! EDITED TO SAY: Just saw your results!! Yayyyyyy!!!!!!!!!! :D",
