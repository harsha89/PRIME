So, they sent me for an MRI-guided biopsy this past Tuesday.  I just got the results today and was told that they found DCIS in the biopsy, but they also found some invasive cells.  Since the pathology report is only preliminary, they don't have any of the grading for me yet.  My DCIS was ER/PR+, can I expect that the invasive will be the same?  She said next steps are to schedule me for a lumpectomy and a sentinel node biopsy.   If the sentinel node is clean, does that mean I don't need any axillary biopsy and that I'm probably in line for radiation and tamoxifen?  If the sentinel nodes are not clean, then what?  Axillary?  Does the fact that the sentinel node has never lit up on the MRI bode well for any involvement? Does size of the tumor have anything to do with the likelihood of it having spread?  I thought so, but I've seen women on here with <1cm IDC who had metastasis.   Coming to terms with the original DCIS diagnosis was hard enough, but what's given me strength up until now was that it was in situ.  Now that that has changed, I'm completely terrified once again.  Not for myself, but for my kids.  Anyone who had a similar situation and is willing to weigh in, please do.  I need some comfort right now.

Like the others here, I'm overwhelmed with anxiety and worry, can't sleep, don't eat regularly, etc...The only person I've told about this is my husband, who, while he tries hard to relate, can't. I hope that anyone who is either awaiting a biopsy or the results of one hears good news over the next few days. ",

Take a look at my profile below.  Unlike you, I was originally diagnosed with DCIS and then they found a very small invasive tumor lurking in the DCIS.  Because the DCIS was scattered throughout my breast, my original lumpectomy was unsuccessful getting clean margins.  That was followed by a lumpectomy/breast reduction.  Again, unclean margins.  At that point, I opted for a bi-lateral mastectomy and decided to put an end to being a human pin cushion.  With regard to other treatments - I was able to entirely avoid radiation because of the mastectomy.  I do, however, take Tamoxifen.  I think most doctors will tell you that it is necessary to prevent either a recurrence at the scar site or kill any rogue cells that may have escaped. Best wishes to you and your surgery.",

I think it's human nature to want to catastrophize things when they happen.  I know my mind automatically goes to the worst case scenario.  It took 3 weeks to get my appt with a surgeon and I met with him yesterday.  In those 3 weeks, I'd done tons of research and had thought I understood my diagnosis and had neatly tucked away my emotions.  Not true.  Yesterday all the fears came flooding back.  Just walking into a place called the \"Breast Cancer Center\" was daunting.  Seeing women sitting in wheelchairs and walking around with wigs on made me shake.  I wanted to run out the door and never come back.  I left the dr.'s office, headed to the car and sat inside and just wept and wept.  To top off a bad emotional day, it was my husband's birthday yesterday and as we're eating cake, he starts talking about all the things he's grateful for and his family, etc...I had to excuse myself from the cake eating and go upstairs and weep some more.   This whole journey just stinks and so far, there isn't one single part of it that's any good.  The kids want to know why my eyes are red, if I'm feeling okay, what's wrong mommy....I hope for both of us that things get better from here.  I'll be thinking of you. ",

I opted for the bilateral mastectomy because I didn't want to sit in that chair and be told I had cancer ever again.  My surgeon said that I could opt for a lumpectomy with radiation and hope that the radiation killed any remaining DCIS.  That was a risk I wasn't willing to take.  And, I didn't want mismatched breasts.  Hell, after what I went through, I wanted to make sure they matched...and they do.  I figured I'd used my breasts for what they were intended to do - breastfeed my babies.  The lack of feeling sucks, but you eventually get kind of used to it - never completely used to it.  The upside is, I never have to wear a bra EVER AGAIN!!!  They are perky all the time.  My dear husband said he thought it was a big upgrade from my natural breasts since after 3 babies in 5 years and A LOT of breastfeeding, my boobs didn't look that great.    I wish you all the best, Kiko.  Feel free to private message me if you want to talk further.  And remember, you're going through the absolute worst of it right now.  You will get through this and someday cancer will be a distant memory for all of us.  Stay strong and believe in the future.  ",

I would urge all of you who are young to try to find a support group that's aimed at providing support for women diagnosed at a younger age.  When I was diagnosed, I contacted a support group that was recommended by a friend who'd gone through this prior to my diagnosis.  They had a buddy support network and I asked to be assigned to a buddy.  I specifically asked for someone who was diagnosed at my age and who maybe had children.  What I wanted most to know in those dark, dark days was that people survived this disease.  It felt like such a death sentence!  They assigned me to a 65 year old woman who'd never had kids and who couldn't relate to my situation at all.  And then I found a support group aimed at younger women who, like me, had been frustrated to be sitting in a room full of 70 year old women.  The point of my post is not to disparage older women, but most of us would agree that younger women with children who are pre-menopausal have a different set of circumstances to face. If you can't find one in your area, keep coming to this site for support and answers to your questions and when you are back on your feet, think about maybe starting a support group with other young survivors in your area.  It has made all the difference for me.  In fact, I have begun a series of profiles in my group, profiling young survivors who are years out from their diagnosis.  I hope that other newly diagnosed women can read these profiles and take solace in the fact that women do survive this disease at many different ages.   Best wishes to you all.",
