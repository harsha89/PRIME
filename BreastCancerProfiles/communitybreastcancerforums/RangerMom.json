I had a large lump in my right breast and a lymph node on diagnostic ultrasound, then they did an MRI of both breasts and found I had cancer in the left breast too. It got biopsied and came back progestrone positive, the left breast is estrogen positive, 2 different cancers gonig on. The left was Stage 0 and the right was Stage IIIa. So its always good to take a good hard look at both breasts. The good news is I was told only 3-4% of women are diagnosed with simultaneous breast cancer. But whatever, Im glad to know we are getting all the cancer now instead of it coming back to haunt me if I had left the one breast. Also - I did chemo first and the chemo reduced the right breast mass in half but didn't work at all on the left breast. Doesn't matter though since it hadn't metzd and its coming off on Aug 16th anyway and radiation to follow.   I'm like Blondlawyer - can't have reconstruction till 9 mos or so after radiation. I met with the PS yesterday to discuss my options and he is going to mark up my boobs prior to surgery so the BS can save skin for the recon down the road.  Chemo was brutal I have to admit and what helped me through it was not looking too far ahead, but just get me through each day Lord. Also I joined a Chemo group for the month I started and we helped each other out tremendously with side effects (SE) and encouragement. So you might want to jump onto a chemo group too.   Hugs and positive vibes to everyone. Healing prayers to those who have had their surgery already. Love, Linda ",

I am doing pretty good but i do have my moments where i'm so sad and wonder \"what's this all for\" and what's my purpose here. So I have been on an emotional rollercoaster with ups and downs. I think this in between phase of not being able to do my normal activities, but havaing to be patient for the healing to come, is giving me too much time on my hands to think. I feel unattractive and someone said it earlier, concave, right now and I don't like it.

Also, if you have't tried an icepack at the drain site, that might help too. It helped for me, calmed the area down as I had a stitch that was pulling through my skin and hurt like crazy.

I want to do the same as you, chemo first, then surgery, then radiation. I had my pet/ct baseline scan done last week and it shows some irregular nodules in my right lung. I'm waiting to speak with the doc tomorrow. so I understand how you feel so anxious about the test results. Next week is my first visit to the onc.  I will keep you in my prayers. Please keep me posted and I will you on our results. Some things that help me during the wait for all these tests, is watching movies. You can get so engrossed while its on you don't think of anything. Or go to a movie. Being with people does help sometimes as long as I don't get started talking about \"stuff.\"  I went to my local library and picked up several. Reading a good \"romance\" book helps me too. Silly but anything that keeps my attention away from thinking. Be good to yourself too, maybe a manicure or get out in the beautiful woods for a walk.",

My CTs showed possible lung lymph node involvement and possible liver lesions. I don't have anything definitive to tell them, as I have a PET if approved (16th) and an MRI of the liver (18th) coming up. These tests are after the reunion. Talking to them would ruin the reunion, or put a damper on it anyway. My parents have lost one daughter to cancer already. I'm even not sure if I do get the dx that there is mets to the liver, if I want to tell them at all. I feel like it would only cause them more alarm, and for what good would it do to upset them more. Initially, with each progression, I would tell them but as time goes on and if its in fact moved to liver and lungs, I'm more hesitant to say anything. I think it would be better to wait for the next treatment to start to take effect and then tell them some good news. I think tonight I'm going to have to take a sleeping pill to knock me out.

They didn't work for that pain and we later found out it was new mets to my hip and S1, L2 that was causing the pain. Its funny how my BS said radiation can cause the pain even after years later. She said my muscles, tissues, etc. are still healing and she said scarring where rads were done. She said to exercise my arms and that would help. Right now exercise is the last thing I want to do. Please post on here what your doc says for you and I hope its not any new mets. Yes, we do drive ourselves crazy each time there is a new pain. Its insane! or we make our loved ones insane!",

Had the MRI today and got these results: Numerous cystic foci scattered throughout the liver. There is no clear MRI evidence of enhancement along the periphery and benign cysts would be considered more likely. Question I have: with right rib pain in the front and back ribs and the CT scan saying \"enhanced peripheral uptake in liver lesions\" would you be content or satisfied with the above impression? I've had this rib pain for about 6 months and its gotten worse in the last couple of weeks. I am going to ask if insurance will cover a PET scan now since the MRI wasn't clear. Do you think a biopsy of one of the cysts (one is 9.5 cm) might be considered too? Or do I just let this go and live with the pain (nothing showed on bone or ct scan in the ribs for mets)???? I am upset that I don't have a clear answer to what is going on. I welcome your opinions again please! Thank you",

I will try taking a muscle relaxer this time instead of the vicodan to see if that helps with possible muscle spasms. I see the onc this Tues and if the pain is still strong and persistent, I'll ask about the patch. Your post was mighty helpful to prepare me for my visit. It could be good news and this pain is just as you say, radiating from the spine (and that's one of the suggestions my BS said it could be).",

Or another person who can help is a Nurse Navigator if your Mom has one from the cancer center she goes to? Another option is to call the cancer center social worker and ask for help there. it sounds like you are not satisfied with the treatment your mother is getting and I would think calling and having a dialoge with any of these would start to get you the help you need or get you in the right direction for what to do next. I have to say that there will be a time for all of us that there won't be a treatment left. Its something we learn at the onset of our dx, usually, through our doctors or through literature regarding stage IV mbc. We all hope for a long time before that happens, knowing there will come a time to say we are ready to accept this.  That's where Hospice can help us with the accepting part and the fear of accepting it. Hospice can add to our quality of life even. I am so sorry for you and your Mom going through this very challening time.",

I got started on treatments right away on Faslodex and Xgeva. I can't tell you why and my onc couldn't say why either, that the biopsy came back negative.  end result is I got that I needed to be on. See if the onc willdo the same for your mom. I kind of wish we hadn't waited 6 mos to see what was going on. At the time of the biopsy, I knew in my gut that it was cancer. It had been there the previous year on a CT scan but I wasn't told about it and it had grown in a year. hence the biopsy. then grew again and more spots. Hope my story helps",

I had a CT scan of the abdomen that suggested mets in my liver via enhanced perhiperhal uptake of lesions. the MRI today said this: A lobular focus is noted anteriorly in the right lobe with some thin internal septation or may correspond to two adjacent cysts or this focus measures up to 2.5 cm. I know it doesn't read right but this is what it said. In the impression it said that the multiple cystic foci were more likely benign because it didn't show any perhiperhal enhancement. So basically, the MRI canceled out what the CT scan said. But....I have horrible right rib pain, front and back ribs and its been on going for 6 months now. Nothing shows in the bones there. What would you do with 2 scans, one saying possible mets and the other not when there is still severe pain? Thanks for your input and thoughts? ",

Once I started on the boards again, it really did give me some calmness in the midst of tests, rad onc appts, etc. This is the hardest time right now and they all told me, it will get better, you'll feel better once your tx start and by God they were right. it's still sinking in but at least now I have hope that i can and I will live a little longer. Where as at first, I could only think, \"i wonder when I'm going to die, I wonder how much time I've got left.\"  I'm more grounded now and calmer. We are all here for you.",

I too had won a vacation with Little Pink this year and can vouch for all they offer. It was a life changing week for me and I cried tears of joy throughout my week on the retreat. Everyone is so good to you. I met so many wonderful women on the retreat and it did my heart good to see all of laugh and smile without any cares in the world.",
