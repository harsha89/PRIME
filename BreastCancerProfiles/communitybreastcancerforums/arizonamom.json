I had a call back on my mammogram, and along with a couple benign cysts, the magnified images showed suspicious looking clusters of calcifications. There are 3 clusters in my left breast and 1 in my right. The want to do 2 biopsies, one on each breast. The attending doctor assured my that they were 80% likely to be benign, but it is important to follow up with biopsies to be sure. He also said that if they are cancer, they are early stage and treatable. I'm hoping someone might have some insight about why I would present with 4 different clusters over both my breasts? I read a little about DCIS. Is this a disease that is typically found in multiple areas over both breasts? Does the fact that there are multiple areas involved make it more or less likely that it is cancer? What does it mean if it is cancer? Should I be be preparing myself for a double mastectomy if \"pre-cancer\" is found? Last May (2014), I was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer with mets in the liver. Fortunately the cancer was resectable and I had major surgery last July that removed half my colon and 30% of my liver. I also had 6 months of chemo. I have had 6-8 ct scans over the last 14 months for diagnosis and monitoring. I have been NED since surgery. It was quite a ride, but I am doing OK. I am wondering if any of this might explain the calcifications? Too much exposure from CT scans? Chemo? Pathology did not show Lynch Syndrome. When I was 18, I had a fibrous cyst removed from my breast that was found to be benign. I have also had many fluid filled cysts over last 7 years of routine mammograms. I had a breast doctor 5 or 6 years ago that would come in with a needle right after my mammograms and suck out the extra pockets of fluids. Could any of this \"trauma\" to the breast cause irregular calcification clusters? One other thing that may or may not be relevant..I was a bit of a breastfeeding fanatic and with four kids, I have over 12 years of breastfeeding under my belt. When I saw that DCIS is related to the milk ducts, it made me wonder if there might be a connection between excessive breastfeeding and benign (albeit \"abnormal\") calcification. Just reaching for some kind of explanation. I realize it is all speculation until the biopsies are done, but I also know how valuable my colon cancer online community has been for me to talk things through, and help me know the right questions to ask and when to seek second opinions. For example, should I be asking for biopsies in all suspicious areas? I'm trying not to get freaked out. But i kind of feel like with my (stage 4) history, in this case, coming to terms with a rational \"worst case\" scenario (aka double mastectomy?) might actually make these days a little easier. Does that make sense to anyone? Thank you so, so much!! Log in to post a reply",
