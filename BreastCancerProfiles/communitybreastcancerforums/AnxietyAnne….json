I had to undress from waist up so that she could examine my breasts. I really need to have someone with me at these appointments. I do remember her saying 85% chance it is nothing. She said that it is fine to wait the 5 weeks to have the biopsy until my husband comes home. She said enjoy your Thanksgiving. The nurse said that she was a BC and lung cancer survivor and told me that I was going to be just fine and gave me a hug. I got dressed and took the wrong exit. I was trapped in the stairwell. My doctor heard me knocking and led me to the exit. I am still trying to calm my nerves.",

I am thinking , do I have to wait that long to know the results of the biopsy. Now yesterday I got a message from them saying that the follow up will be moved to the next day. Silly me before I call to confirm am thinking the follow up will be on the 17, the day after surgery, maybe because it was so close to the holidays that they were speeding things along. But no the follow up is now on December 24. Any day you hear bad news is awful, but I have family coming from across the country to spend the holidays. I don't want to ruin the holidays for my family. I just want to deal with this alone and not burden anyone. I know that my family will be so upset when I even tell them about the biopsy. I still have not said a word to my husband and he is so excited about being home for Christmas. He has not been home for Christmas in over 4 years due to his job. This may seem crazy but telling my family is as stressful as waiting for the results. I still have faith of a benign outcome, but of course that little voice in the back says \"what if\" . Mayanne I am reading over your post to keep my sanity and for encouragement. All the best to you.",

Consultation with surgeon on November 7. I really can't describe how I feel right now. I have to force myself to eat. This happens whenever I go through troubles in my life. I think my brain is in some kind of self-preservation mode because if I try to think too deep into my situation the thought goes out of my head.

I have even had an appetite this weekend, and for me that is great because I have barely eaten since I was told on the 31st that I will have a biopsy. The person who gave me the news that I had to have the biopsy, I think he was a doctor, I was kind of numb,he said he is doing the biopsy to be sure and that it may be nothing. He said more but I don't remember lol. Today I am kind of panicky so I had to let my feelings out. I wish that I could stop thinking about things that I think might happen.
