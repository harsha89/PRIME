When I dropped off last years mammo for them to compare they gave me the new report. I have very dense breasts, which is the same as last year. For the left breast it says focal asymmetry in the posterior medial in the MLO and CC projections. The conclusion says left breast asymmetries. The lump I had removed was taken out of the left, but it was over more near my armpit side. So now im waiting for them to compare mammos. But none of this was on last years report. It was completely normal. Im so upset about this. I just watched my aunt die last mnth of inflammatory and it was the worse thing iv ever seen in my life. So anybody ever have this or know what it means?? Thank you:) Log in to post a reply",
