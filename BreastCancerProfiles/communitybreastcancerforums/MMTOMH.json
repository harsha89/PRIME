LOL.  I didn't use any ice pack and kept all my nails...didn't even turn black...weird how everyone is so different! Take care.",

Is that because of increased risk for mets related to the high grade?  So much to learn.  Thanks for helping me on my journey!",

I can feel that my tumor has shrunk a little even after just one treatment...sure motivates me to continue on!",

How can you be at the same level?  The only things that changed in that person's life was what they chose to change (other than the fact they know they have cancer and that affects everything, but I just don't see how it can as much when you don't have to feel bad, have chemo, undergo surgery or radiation, etc.)!
