I can tell that mentally it is weighing on her and she is very scared of what lies ahead and just ... getting sad. We are both putting up brave fronts for the other -- I'm her only child so she knows she can lean on me completely. @ruthbru, melissadall & melmcbee -- you know, the funny thing is, she hasn't had a steak or anything \"bad\" since I was in junior high school (I just turned 49); SHE'S the one who got me into green juices, vitamins, etc.  That's why I think she's like \"WTH!?!\" @ruthbru -- thanks for \"getting it\" re RIGHT NOW.  @ruthbru & brooksideVT -- thank's for all the specific info re lupectomy & anesthesia -- feeling a little better about both. @Icandothis -- exactly what I am afraid of and I think that she is starting to realize that it ain't a \"go quietly into the night\" type of deal if she does nothing. @ballet12 -- I would love to get that contact info for doc at Duke. I went to school near there and we have family in NC so it wouldn't be that hard to go up there and stay for treatment.  How do we exchange info? The fact that your husband's aunt was kind of advanced, in her late 80s and is doing well is ubber encouraging. @ballet12, mermaid, ridley & encyclias -- thanks for the encouragement and tales of older women in your families who made it though treatment relatively unscathed -- it is forcing me to stay positive, look on the Sunny Side of the Street and throw doomy/gloomy thoughts right away.   Okay lovely ladies.  Tomorrow is biopsy day. About to go make us a couple of green smothies and me and Moms are gonna have a girls night in and watch the first episode of ABC's Scandal for this year.  (Really good show and so involved/intriguing, takes your mind of your troubles.)    THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU ",

I am taking it all in, adding notes to my little notepad. I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I posted same question in the alternative forum.  Because we will probably need to combine with regular medicn, I am wondering what is the best way (topic/forum) to look for suggestions re top doctors in Georgia (?)  ",
