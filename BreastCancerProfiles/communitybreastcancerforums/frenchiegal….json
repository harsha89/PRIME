It's a copy of my MRI report, I know that circumscribed margins are good along with the oval shapes but I don't understand what the background parenchymal enhancement or the \"motion: mild/moderate\" or the \"Mixed plaeteau and washout enhancement\" means?  FINDINGS: Background parenchymal enhancement: Moderate-severe and symmetric which could obscure (reduces the MR sensitivity for detection of) a small or noninvasive malignancy. Amount of fibroglandular tissue: Heterogeneous fibroglandular tissue. Motion: Mild/moderate. RIGHT BREAST: There is a 0.4 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm (width, AP, CC) oval shaped mass with circumscribed margins located central to the nipple posterior depth. There is mixed plateau and washout enhancement. There is a 0.7 x 1.3 x 0.7 cm (width, AP, CC) oval shaped mass with circumscribed margins located at 4:00 middle depth. There is predominantly persistent enhancement. LEFT BREAST: There is a 0.8 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm (width, AP, CC) oval shaped mass with circumscribed margins located central to the nipple posterior depth. There is predominantly persistent enhancement. AXILLA: Unremarkable. VISUALIZED CHEST AND UPPER ABDOMEN: Unremarkable. IMPRESSION: 1. 1.1 cm oval mass in the left breast at 4:00 posterior depth. Recommend second look ultrasound and biopsy by method of best visualization (although this mass likely will not be amenable to an MR biopsy given its posterior location). 2. BI-RADS 4: Suspicious Abnormality-Biopsy Should Be Considered. ***BREAST BIOPSY RECOMMENDATION*** Patient notification date/time 05/15/2018 at 3:00 PM, 0 business days after exam interpretation. 3. 0.7 cm right breast mass central to the nipple posterior depth. Recommend second look ultrasound. If not visualized, recommend a 6 month breast MRI follow-up. 4. 1.3 cm right breast mass 4:00 middle depth. Recommend a second look ultrasound. If not visualized, recommend a 6 month breast MRI follow-up given that this may be several small adjacent foci. The patient will be scheduled for biopsy by a mammography NP. The patient's",

Google is kind of helpful but I'm trying to understand overall what is going on in layman's terms when I'm comparing my MRI to my ultrasound is a little confusing. Left side: HISTORY: 34-year-old female presents for second look ultrasound of MRI findings Ancillary medical support personnel/chaperone: Christina Ramos RT(R)(M). FINDINGS: ULTRASOUND: Focused ultrasound of the left breast 4 o'clock 4 cm from the nipple posterior depth demonstrates a 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.5 cm oval shaped hypoechoic mass with Not circumscribed (angular) margins. There is no significant internal vascularity. The mass is oriented parallel the skin and demonstrates no significant posterior features. This mass correlates with the MRI finding. IMPRESSION: 1. 7 mm hypoechoic left breast mass as described above. 2. BI-RADS 4: Suspicious Abnormality-Biopsy Should Be Considered. ***BREAST BIOPSY RECOMMENDATION*** Right: ULTRASOUND: Lesion number 1: Focused ultrasound of the right breast at 4:00 o'clock 1 cm from the nipple posterior depth demonstrates a 0.8 x 0.3 cm oval shaped hypoechoic mass with circumscribed margins. There is no significant internal vascularity. The mass is oriented parallel the skin and demonstrates no significant posterior features. This mass correlates with MRI finding. Lesion number 2: Focused ultrasound of the right breast at 4:00 o'clock 3 cm from the nipple anterior depth demonstrates a 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm irregular shaped hypoechoic mass with Not circumscribed (angular) margins. There is peripheral, but no significant internal vascularity. The mass is oriented parallel the skin and demonstrates posterior shadowing. This mass correlates with MRI finding.  I would really appreciate the feedback. Biopsies are scheduled for 13 June.",

It was completely debilitating. Emend took the edge off (sometimes) but I was ready to throw in the towel as well. I remember crying in the bathroom after my 2nd infusion thinking there was no way I would be able to endure anymore A/C because I was sick every single day. Long story short I stuck it out. I am now finishing up Taxol and it has been night and day for me. Nausea is pretty much gone. Still having a little fatigue and that's about it. Sending you good thoughts! :)",
