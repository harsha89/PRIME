I now am having so much pain in my feet that I can hardly stand. I m OK after walking for a while; however, when I first stand up - oh my goodness!  I am exactly one year past chemo so I am not sure what is going on. The pain just started a few weeks ago. I have a massage therapist who works on my feet and it does no good at all. My toes and where my toes attach to the foot are numb. If you put your hand on the ball of my foot and push, the pain is so severe that I can hardly stand it. I am going to make an appointment with Podiatrist real soon. Any ideas?",

I have had first consult visit and will be going in for my marking soon. My question is regarding the porta cath - did you have one and if so when do you plan to have it removed? Mine is scheduled to be removed October 8 and some folks are telling me that is too soon. Dx: 3/18/09 IDC; 2.5cm; grade 3; stage 1-2; ER/PR+",

Mine has been aggravating the crap out of me also Patti. It became inflammed on one occasion and scared me goofy! I just want it out. Mine is pretty deep and will have to go to OP surgery to have it removed. Good luck to all you guys and we'll just keep hanging on for the next adventure.    Virginia",
