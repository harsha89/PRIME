Background- 31 years old, with twin girls , married, tubal ligation (no more children) Mother has had ovarian cancer, Maternal grandmother passed away from bc age 51 diagnosed @ age 49 also had ovarian cancer earlier in life. Paternal grandmother passed away from bc @ age 48 Not sure of diagnosis age. Fathers twin sister has had ovarian and bc both before age 50 with bc reoccurrance at age 55. Another of his sisters has had bc as well. Great Aunt and great grandmother both maternal had ovarian cancer (not sure of diagnosis age)  Maternal grandfather passed and had undiagnosed prostate cancer found in autopsy. Not sure of any men on fathers side with cancer? I myself have had skin cancer (but I do not think that counts in determining risk) I wanted to get gen test however insurance will not cover and I cannot afford. Do not know of anyone in family who has had it done to find out their results. I have considered prophy mast (which my insurance will pay for). I have looked at several pages that pretty much confirms that I am at high risk? But before I get the ball rolling to have the procedure, I was wondering is there anyway the different types of bc can be confirmed and on which family members as most of the info I have has came from family members other than the ones I have witnessed personally. Most of my extended family lives up north and as far as my fathers family goes I have never met any of them face to face I only communicate with his twin sister as most of the children were adopted out and the family was very broken. Also what type of proof will I need to present to be eligible for a prophy mast and insurance pay? Log in to post a reply",

I did more research on my ins. BCBS of florida and it specifically states that it will not cover genetic testing. I do think the test will be useful because another concern I have is my daughters' as they are kind of hit with a double whammy my husbands mother and sister both passed from BC although it was 2 different kinds. I am going to see my GP next week, as I have had ongoing tenderness near my underarm on the outer edge of my right breast for a little over 2 months. I decided to hold off going for this amount of time to be sure that it wasn't a pulled muscle or cycle related which at this point I am sure it isn't. Not to jump the gun and worry about it being BC as most things I have read says BC doesn't present signs of pain. But I do think it still warrants being checked out. I am hoping insurance covers at the least a mammo since I am only 31?",
