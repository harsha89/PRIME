The only excuse we got is that scans are open to interpretation and hard to read. I am still trying to figure out what all exactly happened while I was in that hospital.

I know that it's a shot that is given in 5 smaller doses over 5 days instead of 1 big booster shot. My body reacts badly to all medications... so all these meds is just freaking it out.",

I found out on October 1st that I had the breast cancer after being told many times that I was worried about nothing (having to force my doctors to test me) and being told they would find nothing.... they told me about the Cancer and by October 10th they told me they believed it was in my bones based on Bone Scan and Pet Scan results. I actually get the bone biopsy on Tuesday the 29th but they say they are 99% sure it's in the bone and are already treating it as such based on the scans.",
