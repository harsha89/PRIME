I'm very excited to have stumbled upon this forum because I work at Women's Health Boutique in Dallas, Texas where we do 5-10 Radiant Impressions castings each month. My customers who have custom prosthesis love them because they are light and natural looking.  They are especially nice for women who have very concave chest walls or have had difficulty being fit in a silicone prosthesis.  Radiant Impressions are covered by most private insurance companies and we at WHB accept insurance assignment.  We file your claim and the insurance company pays us so you don't have to pay a dime upfront.  If you are in the Dallas-area or know of someone who might be interested in a custom prosthesis, I would love to hear from you.  Please don't hesitate to contact me at (214) 373-1045 or crystal@whbdallas.com if you have any questions whatsoever.  Even if you don't live in the Dallas area and have questions about the product, need testimonials or need to locate a vendor near you, I'll be happy to assist you!",
