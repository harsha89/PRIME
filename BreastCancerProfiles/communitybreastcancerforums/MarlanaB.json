Because of that, I have always done self breast exams a couple of times of a month. Learn how the cysts feel at the start of your menstrual cycle, mid-month when you're ovulating and right before your cycle starts. Mine tend to feel oval with a little ropy tail on each end and if I press on them, they'll get smaller. Because of the cysts and a family history of BC, I started having mammograms every 2 years at 30 and every year at 40 (my last before I found my \"new\" lump was June '14 and it was clear). The key is to look for changes and learn when to be concerned. I'm now 45 and I had a new lump that I noticed around the end of January that felt just like all the others but by the end of February/first part of March, I noticed that it wasn't following my normal hormonal flow and the lump had turned from the usual firm but squishy to hard as a rock and the shape was unusual. I was on vacation and made an appointment to see my PCP as soon as I got back and was eventually diagnosed with BC but fortunately, I caught it early. To make it even more complicated and scary, my 1.8 cm tumor was sitting on a much larger cyst. The bottom line is that it is better to be safe than sorry and if you have a concern, get a second opinion.",
