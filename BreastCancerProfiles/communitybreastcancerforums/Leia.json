      "Content": "Leia wrote: I haven't been here, in a while. But found this new story, on breastcancer.org of interest: www.breastcancer.org/risk/new_... The lead sentence says, \"Cigarette smoking dramatically increases the risk that a woman who has undergone radiation treatment for breast cancer will develop lung cancer later on, a new study shows.\" In August, 2006, I was diagnosed with IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2-. I had a lumpectomy, with totally clear margins. They wanted me to do the radiation. I initially went to the appts, but in the end, I refused. Walked out. With totally clear margins, from the surgeon, why torture, my body? And now, this study. 18 months, later. I'm a long-term, smoker. Which I've totally been honest, with all of my docs, since forever. But now, if I had agreed, to the radiation, NOW I have a much greater chance of getting lung cancer. CAUSED by this \"radiation therapy.\" Which provides such a minimal benefit. I'm continuing to get the mammos. My next one is in two days. And probably, another MRI. And if it's cancer, again, I'll deal with it, surgically. I am NEVER getting, radiation. This radiation, makes no sense, to me. Nor, any of these other \"treatments.\" But, that's just for me. Smoker, IDC, 2cm, Stage I, Grade 1, 0/3 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Plus, I weigh, 132, but have 36DD breasts. YMMV. My point, don't automatically believe, the docs. They're just operating off the latest \"study.\" And this lung cancer one, was a real eye-opener, for me.

My entire breast was bruised, and it continued, down my back. It was grotesque. Although, over time, it receded. Yet, while the \"lump\" at the excision site continued to recede, it didn't go down, fast enough, for the docs. They all just wanted to keep biopsing, \"the lump.\" In January of 2009, I had an MRI they said, Birad 5, I had cancer, again.   In the end, it was NO cancer. For me, my body is STILL resolving that 2006 hematoma. That caused a false positive on that MRI. Someone said, pay attention, to your own body.   I could not agree, more.  ",

It never made any sense, to me.  And with this NYT article, makes even MORE sense. That my decision, was right. And by now, I'm almost four years out, no recurrence. With no radiation.   Radiation causes cancer. There are numerous studies, today, that say that. Just like once upon a time, it was a Radical Mastectomy,for everyone with breast cancer. That is currently, a non-starter. And soon, it will be, forget this \"Radiation\" for DCIS. Or IDC, ANY diagnosis.   I'm just GLAD that I NEVER had any Radiation.  ",
