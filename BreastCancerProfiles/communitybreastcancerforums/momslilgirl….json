Now yesterday we got told that it has spread to lymphnodes in neck, a spot in the bones that look \"suspicios\" and Brain mets. \"Very small\" was thw word the onc said. He's putting her on a regiman of 5 radiation treatments to the brain. Then Chemo, Herceptin then a drip of some kind. He also told her she can't drive until the brain mets dissapear. Can't really say we saw any of this coming. I wanted to ask those who know more than I do if she has a possibility of coming out of this? Can people have remission if there is brain mets? I know ever cancer patient is unique, just I'm looking for truth and I'm really scared. Thanks for reading :) Manda Log in to post a reply",

And I know there asking because it the \"polite\" thing to do but at the same timei just want to scream \" she's gonna die! That's how she's doing....how's your day going?\" I get that ppl don't understand and its a rarity that I come across someone who has a similar life. My mom actually has a bit of a sense of humor about it. She has a cronic cough that gets really bad and when she has a coughing fit out in public and ppl stare she'll respond \" don't worry its cancer, its not contagious\" which catches ppl off guard but it the truth right? I really hate cancer though...I truly wish ppl didn't have to ask or make comments about how ppl \"look\".",

As a child of cancer it's nice to know ppl are LIVING with the disease and fighting as hard as they can.",
