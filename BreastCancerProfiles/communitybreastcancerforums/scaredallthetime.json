    "Content": "scaredallthetime wrote: Hi Everyone. I am 31 one years old and on Sunday I found a red spot (about the size of a nickel) on my left breast. It isn't raised or scaly. It doesn't hurt or itch. It looks like a spider vein almost, in a circular shape. It has gotten smaller since then. It is now about the size of a pea.  I am due to start my cycle any day so my breast is tender. The left one is a bit more tender than the right. But that could also be in my head. I have extreme anxiety. I saw an Urgent care doc on Sunday who was no concerned about it, but hadn't really heard of IBC. I saw my GP on Monday and she wasn't worried either. She stated it did not have any of the markers of IBC. I am still very concerned. Any advice? Words of wisdom? I am very scared. Log in to post a reply",
