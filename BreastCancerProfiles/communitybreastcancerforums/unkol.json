    "Content": "unkol wrote: I'm a 20 year old male. The other day I was driving and noticed my left nipple ached when the seatbelt pushed against it. When I got home after driving, I pushed on my nipple and noticed it had a hard lump under the outer ring and it ached when I pushed on it. It hurt for the rest of the day when things rubbed on it and then it started only hurting to touch. The lump is small and hasn't grown since. It came overnight. Then 2 days later, my right nipple started to form a lump just like my left nipple but this one is the size of my whole nipple, and I noticed a small lump under my left armpit that hurts to touch. I've put quite a bit of weight on my torso, especially my breasts, in the past 6 months. My nipples aren't sore or red and they don't itch and I don't have any other symptoms.
