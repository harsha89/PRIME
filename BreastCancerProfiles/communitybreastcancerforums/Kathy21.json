I had two nodes removed, but my incision looks like they took 15 - I guess that is normal, not sure. Like you just got involved in these forums and learning as I go.",

My appointment with the radiologist is this week on Friday and reading all the different versions that are administered I can't imagine what options or non options I will have offered. I am doing mine through the University of Pennsylvania so I know a lot of clinical trials are available but not sure I would be up to that sort of thing. Learning a lot so I hope you don't mind me being a week later in surgery and joining in. I know one version they offer is a 10 treatment but don't know if I qualify as of yet. My first post op is on Thursday, the day before the radiologist appointment. My only issue is numbness and pain under my arm but not overly severe but worrisome since it is hard to distinguish normal from more complicated. I wish they saw you a week later so you had a little confidence you are healing correctly.",
