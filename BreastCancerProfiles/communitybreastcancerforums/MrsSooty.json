      "Content": "MrsSooty wrote: I am 58 and in Feb was diagnosed with breast cancer in both breasts. In total, 2 possibly 3 sites of invasive cancer were found plus DCIS at another site. They were very small and grade 1 and grade 2, considered not very aggressive. They have been removed through lumpectomies. My two sisters have also had post menopausal breast cancer but a genetic assessment suggests our cancers are not BRCA1 or 2, but does not eliminate that it may be some other genetic predisposition. I have dense breasts that are very difficult to screen. Current advice seems to be that radiation followed by hormones is the way to go, and cancer is unlikely to return. But I am wondering if a double mastectomy will reduce the risk of another cancer forming somewhere in the breast tissue (but there are extras risks with such operations) and missing such an event in screening. I'm also having trouble piecing together the statistics for my particular circumstances. Any comments would assist as I need to decide over the next few days. Log in to post a reply",

I will check with my radiation oncologist regarding the effectiveness of radiation for my cancers which are on multiple breast sites. I am also doing my 'for and against' list, and trying to weight the importance of each item for me. I am having trouble finding statistics on the importance of some items, such as the effectiveness of alternative treatments for preventing recurrence when found at multiple sites or with family history (not BRCA). I am thinking I might get an additional independent medical opinion. Again thank you. I didn't realise how hard it would be to make such choices, but as someone told me, it's an important window of opportunity for me that will pass, and I should make sure I understand and agree with the decision as much as I can.",
