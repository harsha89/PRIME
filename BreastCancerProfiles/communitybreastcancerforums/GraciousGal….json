My BMX in January '12 took about 4 hours - 2 hours for each side. However, that was in conjunction with an immediate reconstruction. My lumpectomies in August '11 took about an hour - maybe two, with the SNBx (sentinel node biopsy). The recovery was vastly different. I didn't feel up to my normal energy level after the BMx until about 6 weeks out. The Lx recovery was almost immediately. We were moving to a new place and the moving truck arrived (with 10,000 pounds of \"stuff\") 10 days after my Lx. Although I was not allowed to lift any heavy things, I was able to keep up with everything (directing traffic for where to put furniture and boxes) all day long. Then I unpacked boxes for the next 3 days at a slower pace. It would have been crazy to do that after a BMx.  That all being said, I agree with Soyaandpepper - length of surgery is not a valid determining factor for which one you choose. I am so sorry for the challenges you are facing right now. One day at a time. . . Glad you have found this site. ",

This is a good site from which I have gained invaluable information and encouragement.  You might want to check out the Reconstruction thread to help you decide about that option. The ladies there gave me some great ideas about dealing with anesthesia (a patch) as well as what to expect for each stage. You have a long and complex journey ahead. Try to take it one day (sometimes, one hour) at a time. ",

Having the T.V. control close at hand was nice as well as that pain-med pump! My BMx was on a Friday and I came home on a Sunday.",
