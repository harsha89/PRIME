However, my doctors did anticipate an invasive component prior to my surgery.  My PS said that it was fine to have the TEs placed before chemo but he would probably wait to do the fills until after my chemo was finished and my body had recovered.  His only concern was radiation, which they thought I would need also and was why I had to delay my reconstruction altogether (hoping now for January/February).  Even with rads though, some PS are fine with the TEs in place during treatment.  You might have a little longer reconstruction, but it should not affect it otherwise from what I've read. Good luck and try to put all this aside for at least a few days and enjoy your b-day and Christmas!",
