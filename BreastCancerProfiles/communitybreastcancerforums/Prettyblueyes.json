If someone could help me understand in plain old English what this means. I had my PET/CT today and am waiting for those results and I have an ultrasound guided biopsy Monday. I don't meet with my Oncologist until the 18th.

Well my OB just thought they were engorged ducts. But sent me to get an ultrasound. The tech saw something and sent me for a 3D mammogram. Well they compared it to my 1st mammogram I had done back in 2012 and saw dense mass but nothing else and I was told to get rechecked in 6 months.. A few weeks later I felt a few lumps on my neck, along my lymph nodes on the same side. My OB referred me to a general surgeon but I got busy with life and no one seemed all that concerned sooo. I had my son. And I noticed the lumps were all bigger and there's a new one on my right collarbone and I'm experiencing weird numbness and tingling pain in my right shoulder and going up from the lymph nodes to the back of my head and it hurts to sleep on that side so I called my OB back and they sent me back for an Ultrasound and mammagram. We'll during the Mammagram the tech left and went and got the radiologist. He ran the machine over my breast and I heard them quietly talking and then my baby started fussing and my 7 year old tried to calm him but.. So the radiologist is trying to what seems like tell me he thinks it's cancer I'm hearing him but not sure if I'm hearing him right... He's got a strong Indian accent and my baby is crying. So I get sent for a CT. A few days later with my hubby this time. Iam claustrophobic and proceeded to vomit during the scan:( The last Wednesday I FINALLY met with my surgeon. He did a breast exam and told us to come into his office. Dr S. Proceeds to tell us he's 99% positive I have breast cancer and he's pretty sure it's spread to my lymph nodes. He says we will probably go straight to chemo. Uhhhh hello! Do you see I have a new baby?! I have 3 other kids and a step son?! No family history of breast cancer... So then the whirlwind of making appointments started. Tomorrow I go for a PET/CT scan. Saturday I go for an MRI. Then the 12th I go for ultrasound guided biopsy if just the breast mass. Then I meet the oncologist the 18th, the day after my 42nd birthday. I'm in total shock and freaking out!
