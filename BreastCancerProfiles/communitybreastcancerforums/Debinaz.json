I had my mastectomy 04/16/08 I hadÂ Sentinel Node Mapping done right before surgery. The doctor felt like he removed a large chunk of tissue from the area, however when sent to the lab they can't seem to find the nodes because I had scar tissue from implants put in 8 years earlier. At this point no one seems to know what to due next. I see the oncologist next week and they will order the oncotype DX test. Has anyone had this experience? How will I know if there was any spread without being able to have the lympnodes tested???? Deb in AZ debinaz Dx 2/29/2008, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 1, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
