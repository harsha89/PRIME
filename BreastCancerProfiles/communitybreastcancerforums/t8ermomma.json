She listened and asked questions, and then listened some more before doing the exam. She did feel the lump right away. Didn't even question my sanity once! Which was very reassuring! LOL. The last couple of weeks I have been trying to talk myself into thinking it's all in my mind or it's just lymph nodes, and really talking myself out of panic. At one point right as she was starting the exam I was a little worried about her. She said that generally bc doesn't have pain. I was just about to tell her about the thread on here when she corrected herself. She said that \"GENERALLY\" it doesn't present with pain, but that many women do have it--but we'd focus on the positive thought. I felt so much better after her correcting her statement. I figure if she KNEW that and was willing to make sure that I knew it too-She wasn't going to sugar coat what I needed to hear and she KNEW what she was talking about. It helped calm me. She said that she is not going to take any chances and is sending me for an us and mam at the breast center. She even called them while I was in the exam room. She said that I'll qualify for a grant. And is being so helpful to get me all set up. Anyways, as an after thought she said that part of the lump feels gritty--like she would expect from a cyst. But it's not all gritty. (I can't even feel the gritty part) So, I walked in to my house, looked at my husband and said--it's NOT lymph nodes. And then broke down. I don't think it sunk in until then. So now that we are thinking and not just reacting, we are saying--it's just a cyst. It's just a cyst. Log in to post a reply",

I am thankful that the wait will be shorter, but wow, that just kind of blows my mind that it's happening so fast. I'm used to dr's saying \"we can't fit you in for 4-6 weeks!\" Now to stay calm and collected until then!",

I can only imagine what I'll be like if they come back and say--yup it's there, but don't know why! really and truly, the waiting is the pitts. Fenella, I can imagine that would be a nightmare. It must be so uncomfortable having so many cysts. I know my lump is a pain. LITERALLY! and it keeps pressing on my arm and I lose feeling in my hand. Which is why I was convincing myself that I just had swollen lymph nodes. Hmm, apparently not. I am staying away from google--well as much as I can. A friend mentioned that it sounded weird that it was gritty feeling and the dr said like a cyst--she (my friend) had read that cysts were smooth--so I did go look at that. And almost every website that I looked at it does say they are smooth. So I don't know what that means other than--I'm not going to freak out and I'll wait for the tests . . . . Or I'll try to wait!!",

She left me there and went to talk to the radiologist. because I am young the radiologist didn't want to do another mammogram. My previous mammogram was normal with fibrocystic changes on ultrasound. She felt it was better to start with the ultrasound and skip the mammogram unless they found some changes. my original lump had not changed any. it was fine, but. . . isn't there always a but? she found what looks like a cyst but has blood flow. in her words \"you just bought yourself a mammogram\".  sigh, the mammogram showed nothing. the breast tissue is too dense. which I find very humorous since I have wussy boobs after 4 kids. anyways, she says there isn't anything to do at this point but wait. there is no lump at the site to even do a biopsy. so 6 months of waiting and checking for a lump monthly.  Yes, this should be close to fun!! ugh.  Log in to post a reply",

I didn't have the money for the biopsy and life happend and I didn't go in for the 6 mon check. I know, probably not the best choice, but it is what it is. Wednesday, I had my annual check with a different dr. I found last spring that I really like (first full check in 7 years due to no insurance and other causes that made it strategically/logistically impossible). Dr originally said he wasn't concerned that I didn't go back and that he wasn't a big pusher of Mammograms in the first place. He tends to lean toward not having them until 60 unless there is a reason to (such as family history, lumps, etc). So, as I'll be 38 next week--he didn't seem concerned. Even with the Fibrocystic changes. He was blaming it on Caffeine. LOL AND THEN WE DID THE EXAM! He found one small one on the right breast. Totally new that I hadn't found. He was still confident that it wasn't a big deal as it felt like a cyst. the left hand side though was so large (much larger than it was last year) that he could put his fingers on both sides and moved the mass around. It wasn't tetherred down or anything, so he still is leaning toward fibrocystic changes, but it was harder and larger than expected. And he decided immediately that we need a mammogram asap. His rapid change in concern is what has me concerned. After my initial panic for 2 days, I'm now feeling like it's still just Fibrocystic changes. It's movable, it has some changes during the month--but it is larger, it is harder, and so I see his concern. And wondering if I am just burying my head in the sand. Finally told my mom (she's my step-mom, but her mother died from breast cancer so I didn't want to mention it before until I really knew something for sure--but if this is going to stick around and bite my patutti ever year, I figured I'd give her a heads up) and she is convinced there is no danger. And is adamant that if they want a biopsy I should refuse because her dr told her that if they do a biopsy and it isn't cancerous, it will be in a few years (sounds cockeyed to me, but she has had several of her patients come back with biopsied \"clear\" cysts turning cancerous later on) We don't know my family medical history for anything on either side. So it's just a big question mark. Mammogram is scheduled for Tuesday.  If they want it biopsied, should I? Log in to post a reply",
