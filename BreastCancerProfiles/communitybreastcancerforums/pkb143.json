This finding prompted the radiologist to report possible multifocal DCIS and helped me decide on treatment options. HOWEVER, my insurance company, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, has denied the initial claim (over $4,800) and is supposedly now waiting on \"more information\" from the hospital where I had the MRI before they finalize the claim.",

There is still a good chance for that, so try to focus on that and not waste your energy worrying about it. There are a few things that are different about a diagnostic mammo, such as the number of pictures and views taken, but the best thing is that the radiologist reviews the films immediately and shares the results with you. After I had one last year, my radiologist had me come into his office to look at the images on the computer (it was digitized). He pointed out several areas that concerned him and told me he was recommending a biopsy. So by the time you leave wherever you are getting your diagnostic mammo done, you should have a good idea whether you have something to be concerned about. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Good luck!!",

I did not have to appeal but it took over 2 months to get paid. At this point, I'm happy it was paid without having to go through the appeal process.

DCIS means It's just in the earliest stage of cancer and hasn't yet figured out how to spread -- as far as your doctor has determined at this point!  They won't and don't know that until a full analysis of your breast tissue has been carried out. I started out almost exactly three months ago (March 16) being told I had DCIS following a stereotactic needle biopsy. Exactly 3 months later (June 16) I had a right mastectomy, and 2 days later learned there was an invasive component to mine (so if I understand correctly, it's no longer called DCIS). (Thank God the invasive area was very small and non-aggressive). Women with DCIS have breast cancer. DCIS only describes its current status as best determined by a doctor, radiologist, surgeon or other medical professional. Anyone who dismisses it should be strung up by their gonads. Don't apologize to anyone! You will find hundreds of us right here on this forum who started out with a diagnosis of DCIS and are now missing a breast. Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones who that won't happen to (it's very possible it won't and I truly hope not) but even if it doesn't, you are facing a health crisis nonetheless. *Perhaps I'm just a little bit emotional about this subject right now?? ",

I had a single mastectomy (right breast) June 16. Going into surgery, my diagnosis was DCIS (multifocal) with another suspicious \"area\", which turned out to be a small amount of invasive breast cancer. I was not ready to give up my healthy breast at that time and also immediately knew I would want reconstruction on my right breast. So at my mastectomy I had two surgeons present, my breast cancer surgeon, and my plastic surgeon. The plastic surgeon placed a tissue expander in my right side and I've been undergoing the expansion process since early August (I had two areas of poor skin circulation that had to heal first). So I wish I could tell you the end result, but at this point I'm done with the saline fills (which took from August to November because of my size -- 5\"10\"/180 lbs). Now my plastic surgeon says we wait for 4 months before the exchange surgery. I do know that we are also planning to lift/probably augment the natural (left) breast for symmetry. Since my breasts weren't that symmetrical to start with, I'm confident I'll be happy with what my plastic surgeon does. Good luck to you as you make these tough decisions! **I didn't have to have chemo/rads which also can affect reconstruction decisions.",

Anway, the calcifications on my mammo looked like little bright white dots. Some of them were clustered together and many were randomly scattered. Upon viewing these, the radiologist told me although I've had calcifications before, this time there many new ones, were too numerous to count, and there were a few groups he had circled that he was concerned about. He tried to analyze their nature and appearance, (like whether they were smooth and round), but he couldn't, so classified them as \"interdeterminate.\" This led to the stereotactic needle biopsy. Hearing this, I don't want you to freak out, as I turned out to be in the minority of women whose calcifications turned out to be something. It's widely reported that 80% of the time, they aren't anything to worry about!",
