I said I have fake nails . . do I need to snap them all off???  She couldn't answer me, lol  Luckly, my two index nails were broke, so they put the oxygen clip on one of them.  I feel so for you, its scary when you don't know the outcome, and if it will come back??  Please keep me informed, as I will you.  ",

My doctor was ok with it then, but with my ultra sound last month, she urged me to seriously think about having it done.  Hoping the best for all of us!!",
