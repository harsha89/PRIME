Seems that this showed up 2 lumps in my left breast! My gallbladder surgeon said there was nothing to suggest that these were anything but benign cysts but that it was protocol to send me for an ultrasound to confirm what they suspect. He even wrote 'benign cyst?' on the ultrasound referral form. I have private medical insurance so I was able to get a super quick scan which will be done tomorrow lunchtime. The guy doing it is a breast specialist. I cannot however get myself away from thinking the worst and that they are suspecting cancer but just didn't want to worry me. Would they have written and said benign cyst if they suspected it was more sinister??? I am sorry to be such a baby but I am in a terrible state of panic about all of this as I was not expecting this at all. I cannot feel any lumps and I have no other typical signs of breast cancer!! Any advice/support would be greatly appreciated. Maa xx Log in to post a reply",
