It took most of the day because they gave this rookie lots of extra time and support. But I was done by 1530 and I actually headed back to my office to get a little work done. I have spent the last month very busy with the workup - lining up consults and studies, and having the conversation with those who need to know. My mass grew dramatically over a period of only a few weeks. And I had to wean my very strong-willed toddler. She was actually a champ about it. So now that treatment has finally begun, I'm looking forward to taking all of that energy I was devoting to wrapping my head around this dx and spending it on self-care, and continuing my life. I even got my butt to the gym this morning!",

I've got a lot of \"deferred maintenance\" for the last few years, and the dx has been quite a wake up call. I'm also hoping to avoid neuropathy.... and I figure that the more I can circulate the chemo, the better. Does anyone have any experience with seeing PT pre op? I'm wondering if this would be helpful.",
