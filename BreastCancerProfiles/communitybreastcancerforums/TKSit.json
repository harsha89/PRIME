This subject brings me the most pain and I really don't let my mind \"go there\", for fear of not being able to pull it back together. The thought of not being here for my girls is too much to bear. What I have done that helps is, started a journal book for each of them. I titled them \"You, Me and Us\". I put stories about my childhood, my funny memories, crazy times as a teen, ect in \"me\" part of journal. In the \"you\" part I have the story of my pregnancy with them, their birth story, really everything I can remember from their childhood. Even just the small stuff, like favorite book, names of fav toys or all halloween costums. Then in the \"us\" part I write about special times spent together on vacations, visiting pumpkin patch in Fall, first manicure together, decorating xmas tree, anything that I can remember that was special family times. Months ago I thought, Damit if I am gone, these sweet girls should still get to know what precious times we had, they need to know all the info that ONLY a mother would know about their lives. Why should they have to miss out on the memories of their mama? I am not going to let that happen. Cancer may take my body from them, but I will be damned that it takes our memories with it. You would think it would be sad writting all this in my daughter's books, I did. But it brings me such joy going back in time and remembering what a blessed life I have had. What started out as a gift to give my girls after I am gone, has turned into a gift for me. A gift of remembering a life with these 2 beautiful girls. A gift of knowing that I have got everything I had ever prayed for. I feel so happy when I am done writing, the best therapy for me. Different memories come to me that I have't thought about in years and I just smile and am pumped that my girls will get to read it. I am full of hope that I will fill that book with many memories to come. Prayers to all you mother's struggling with this dispair.",

He is concerned about the radiation exposure, which I understand, I just don't want to miss a recurrence. Onco said that if my labs looked funky or if I had any suspicious symptoms, he would be glad to schedule one at my visit in 3 months. My PET scans have been NED for 4 years (I have them every 6 months), I am in good health otherwise, with no aches or pains. Any thoughts? Thank you! You don't have a soul. You are a soul.
