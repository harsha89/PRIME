All negative. I have the summer off since I'm a teacher, so I think that has helped.  I just completed six weeks of radiation (the last seven days were the boost). I don't think I ever fully got my energy back after the surgery, but I haven't really felt the overwhelming fatigue that the doctors warned me about. Maybe I'm just fighting through it. I just have undercurrents of tiredness all the time. I find that if I keep busy, I am usually okay. But I have been taking naps every day trying to limit myself to 30 minutes. I hadn't worked out since the surgery, but I started light (3x wk) workouts during the last three weeks of radiation. I think it helped. I still feel sluggish... not really tired. Just like I don't have any energy or \"umph.\" I'm hoping it will get better. I'm worried that it will hit me when I go back to work in a couple of weeks. For all of you who have to keep working while undergoing radiation and/or chemo, I give you a lot of credit.",

I don't even work during the summer because I am a teacher, so I am very lucky. But I could only do light workouts three or four times a week. The fatigue wasn't as bad as I expected, but I just had no energy. It's hard to explain. My 6 weeks of rads ended on August 12, and I felt fine for three days afterward. Then it hit me! I could hardly get out of bed for about a week. Now I feel like everything I do is an effort. I resolved to work out at least four days a week starting today, so I hope it helps. I started back to work two weeks ago, and it's exhausting. I think my biggest issue is that I find that I can't think straight. My mind used to be so sharp. Now I feel like I can't focus. I can't articulate what I want to say. What IS that? It's really frustrating! How long do you think this will go on?",

So I was not 100% when rads started in July. Rads ended on August 12. Within a few days after it ended, I could hardly get out of bed for about 4-5 days. I'm still tired. Everything is an effort. I have kept up a positive outlook throughout everything, but the fatigue is getting to me. I don't know how long it will last. My social life has taken a huge hit because all I can do is manage the everyday stuff.",

I was told that I would be able to in time but I should not sleep on that side \"for now\". When I started to sleep on the surgery side, I used a small pillow that they gave me at the hospital. It was really helpful in keeping the pressure off. I think most of my discomfort was due to the 11 lymph nodes they removed. Plus I had to keep my arm elevated frequently. Then my ribs started hirting during radiation. It's such a process...",

I replied earlier, but I'll reiterate. I had DCIS (non-invasive) as well as a 3mm invasive tumor. I had a partial mastectomy (basically a lumpectomy with more tissue removal) and eleven lymph nodes removed - all negative. I just completed six weeks of radiation. I have done my research about hormone replacement therapy, which included talking to friends and family members who've been through this as well as internet research. I will not take Tamoxifen. I know that I can't handle the side effects. I also don't believe in trading one possible problem for yet another. It doesn't make sense to me. I will continue to have an annual mammogram as well as an annual MRI - both based on my surgeon's directive.  I hope this helps you. ",

At least I haven't actually seen any dry skin, but I still have intermittent itching. For that she recommended a cortisone cream. I have been using Aveeno brand, which works sometimes, but not 100%.",
