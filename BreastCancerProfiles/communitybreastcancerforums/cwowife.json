Went to see my PCP for a sick visit in Feb17 where we did discuss the information from October. With my family history ( P.Grandmother and P. Aunt) both having and passing away from breast cancer as well as my very dense breast my PCP ordered a breast MRI. I was told that a mass was found and I would need to repeat the Mammogram and US. The mammo still showed the asymmetry but mass could not be found on US, so a breast MRI biopsy was order. I had the biopsy about a week and a half ago ( which was extremely painful) and received the phone call that the path report says breast tissue and blood vessel. The doctor who performed the biopsy does not agree with the findings and would like to do the biopsy again. My question has anyone experienced a repeat biopsy because doctor/radiologist does not agree with path report. Log in to post a reply",

The pain I experienced during the first biopsy was excruciating so I was a little nervous this time, but happy to say there was no pain. Now to wait for the results.",
