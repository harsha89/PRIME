Soriya:  I would ask for a referral to a rheumatologist.  I've seen one fairly regularly since I started taking the hormone blocker type drugs because my arthritis went from mild to kick-butt almost overnight.   All of these doctors have blinders on though, and that's something to remember.  Oncologists see cancer, rheumatologists see arthritis, GPs think you're just depressed...I think it's up to us to put all the pieces together and push for definitive answers.",

My news is not so great, unfortunately.  The PET showed uptake in the lung nodule and growth since last week, including some lymph nodes.  There was also uptake in the spleen and spinal column, pelvis and femurs.  I'm having a biopsy of the lung nodule in a few days.  Seeing the surgeon on Wednesday.  The oncologist is still saying it could be something else, but admitted that it's looking like cancer.  Either a new primary lung cancer or metastatic breast cancer. (Edited to amend the info.  I re-read the report)",

Most biopsies are negative, but that doesn't make the waiting any easier!  Hoping it goes by really fast for you.",
