I felt the lump yesterday and it is huge. its located under the left breast and she says it hurts her. I am freaking out, my mom has been through some tough times, the loss of my brother, a divorce, retinal degeneration  and now the new discovery.  I am looking for the right doctor to take her to this week to get this checked out, but wanted to know if her symptoms sound familiar to anyone who has experienced this? Your help would definitely be appreciated. Annette NYC. Log in to post a reply",
