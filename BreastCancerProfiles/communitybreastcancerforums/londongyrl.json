Do you know if it's hormone positive? Do you know the stage/grade? My mom was diagnosed three weeks ago with ILC Stage 1. I spoke with the surgeon and asked him to order an MRI BEFORE any further surgery or treatment is done. MRI scans are sensitive enough to show her type of cancer and to see if it has spread. It makes sense to me to find this out before anything further is done. He agreed. It's scheduled for October 30. It's incredibly difficult waiting!! Both my mom and I have healthcare backgrounds so we are going into this with a lot of knowledge already fortunately but there can also be drawbacks to knowing so much as we're now finding out. We are completely stunned with her diagnosis and I'm doing everything I can (research)to help her with this process.",
