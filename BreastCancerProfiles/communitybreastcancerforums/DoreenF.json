My good arm and hand are so sore - I've been having some rib pain and had a bone scan and chest xray about a week ago - chest xray showed summation density and nodule on my lung - so my doctor ordered a CT scan w/ contrast. My veins in my right arm do not show very well - and even getting blood tests is sometimes a challenge. For the CT w/ contrast there's no food or drink 4 hours before the test. My test was scheduled for 2:15 - there was an emergency and I got bumped ... so by the time I got in the CT room and they were trying to do the IV it was after 3 - I think around 3:30 ... the nurse was having trouble finding my veins ... tried my inner elbow area - then my hand - blew my vein there ... then warmed me up w/ hot blankets ... they finally brought in another nurse who does the PIC lines and difficult IVs - she tried a few times - and then went to get her ultrasound - even with the ultrasound (several attempts) they couldn't get the IV setup ... they called my doctor - got agreement to do the CT without contrast - and tried one last time - on the backside of my hand - and still could not get the IV started. They ended up doing the CT without contrast ... I sure hope I don't have to go through that again. They told me that the pictures were very clear and felt that the contrast was not necessary ... I am anxious about the results (who wouldn't be - the waiting for test results is always filled with anxiety). I feel like a pin cushion .. my arm and hand hurt - but .. the good news is they totally understood what lymphedema is and not once did anyone suggest trying my left arm instead - they knew and respected that it was off limits. I hope that I don't have to go through that torture again ... or that I can find a way to get my veins to cooperate more on my right arm ... esp when I have to not have liquid for hours before they want blood ... or an IV. I also hope to have an answer re: the rib pain and the nodule they saw on the chest xray explained - and nothing to worry about very very soon.... Do you have any suggestions for making my veins on my good arm cooperate ??? the nurses today suggested lifting weights and building more muscle on my good arm ...

I currently don't even have all the info I need to work on my 2007 taxes ...  I think that it would be a reasonable request to see if they can work from your 2006 returns - I suspect they are trying to discount the cost of the test for you and would base the cost on your income - if your insurance refuses to pay ...     I hope you can get this straightened out soon ... sorry you're having to worry about this!   Doreen  ",

Do you know what the grade was ?   How old are you?  Generally all of these factors are taken into account.  I was diagnosed with  stage 1 IDC two and a half years ago  at the age of 44 -    my tumor was .9cm ER+++,  PR +++,  Her2-neu negative and no lymph node involvement -  the grade was 2 or 3 (depending on which pathology report -  biospy or tissue from the lumpectomy).  I had the Oncotype DX test done - it was really new at the time -  my Oncotype score was 19.   My oncologist left the decision on whether to do chemo or not to me -  after lots of hard thinking and analysis I chose to decline chemo -  I did have a hysterectomy and removal of my ovaries (other factors involved) and had radiation and am now taking Arimidex. I'm doing well.   If you are interested -  you could choose to consider participating in a trial -   TailorX  -Here's some info about the TailorX trial- you'll notice that the TailorX trial is focused on a broader group of scores -  it spans the high end of the low risk area,  the intermediate risk area, and the low end of the high risk area -  the intent being that they are trying to determine what the cutoff score is for where chemo is truely a benefit - and not overtreatment or undertreatment for a specific case.  the bottom line is that you need to feel comfortable with the treatment you are getting - none of us knows  what our future holds ... we have to make the decisions we feel are the right decisions for ourselves...  as we live with them. \"A large number of these women are receiving toxic chemotherapy unnecessarily, and we need a means of identifying them,\" said Jo Anne Zujewski, M.D., senior investigator in the Clinical Investigation Branch of NCI's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. \"TAILORx could help change the way we treat breast cancer and improve the quality of patients' lives, helping to better identify women who are likely to benefit from chemotherapy from those who are not.\" Oncotype DXTM measures the levels of expression of 21 genes (whether they are transcribed into messenger RNA) in breast tumors. This assessment can more precisely estimate a person's risk of recurrence than standard characteristics, such as tumor size and grade. Based on the Oncotype DXTM gene expression analysis, a recurrence score from 0 to 100 is generated; the higher the score, the greater a woman's chance of having a recurrence if treated with hormonal therapy alone. Women will be studied for 10 years, with an additional follow-up of up to 20 years after initial therapies. Based on their recurrence score, women will be assigned to three different treatment groups in the TAILORx study: * Women with a recurrence score higher than 25 will receive chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy (the standard of care) * Women with a recurrence score lower than 11 will receive hormonal therapy alone * Women with a recurrence score of 11 to 25 will be randomly assigned to receive adjuvant hormonal therapy, with or without chemotherapy. TAILORx is designed primarily to evaluate the effect of chemotherapy on those with a recurrence score of 11 to 25. Women in this last group will comprise 4,390 women, or about 44 percent of the study population. Because the degree of benefit of chemotherapy for women with recurrence scores between 11 and 25 is uncertain, TAILORx seeks to determine if the Oncotype DX test will be helpful in future treatment planning for this group.\" here's a link to a web page which has more information about the TailorX trial  www.cancer.gov/newscenter/pres...  I hope this is helpful,   You also might want to talk to your doctors about anti-anxiety medications and/or sleeping pills.    Many of us rely on medications to help us ....

I'd definitely get it checked out ...    here's my story -  I was 44 when I had my first mammogram (I kept putting it off and not making time out of a busy schedule...) -  I got called back for compression views - and immediately following the compression views they took me into another room and did an ultrasound - they suspected a cyst and recommended a followup mammogram in 6 months -  I said I wanted to get it checked - so they referred me to a surgeon.  The surgeon did an ultrasound guided biopsy in his office -  he tried to asiprate it but got no fluid - so he switched to a core biopsy ...  he was 90% confident that it was a fibroadenoma  (which is benign) ...   everyone was surprised when the pathology came back Invasive Ductal Carcinoma  ...   I was glad that I hadn't waited and watched for 6 months as recommended. The doctors cannot always know for certain what something is based on looks alone .. the only way to know for certain is with a biopsy.  I'd want to know ASAP for peace of mind.   I hope you'll get a biopsy.  Chance are good that its' benign -  but if its' not - the earlier you can deal with it the better off you are.   Hugs, Doreen  ",

      "Content": "Oct 4, 2007 07:47PM - edited Oct 4, 2007 07:47PM by DoreenF Hi:  Have any of your doctors talked to you about having the Oncotype DX test done ?  It's for early stage IDC or ILC w/ ER+  cancer  (used to be for node negative only but recently its' been used for node positive as well).  The test looks at the genes within a sample of the tumor and generates a score which indicates if you are low, intermediate or high risk of recurrance (it actually generates a score which falls into those three categories).  You can read more about the oncotype test here  be sure to access the links at the left hand side of the page too. There's also a trial underway called TailorX - they are studying and following women at the high end of the low risk area, the intermediate risk group and women at the low end of the high risk area - to determine what the cutoffs should be for treatment w/ chemo at both the low end and the high end of the oncotype scores.  It's felt that scores in the low risk do not  receive a benefit from chemo - and scores in the high risk area benefit from chemo - but the intermediate risk group is unclear - so most oncs leave the decision for chemo to the patient.   I had this test done in 2005 when I was diagnosed with Stage 1 IDC.  My score was a 19 - the intermediate risk group starts at 17 ...   I had a couple of long discussions with my oncologist - and ultimately decided to skip chemo - with my oncologists agreement.  I factored in my decision to have an oopherectomy and use one of the newer AI's for my hormone therapy.  I  was 44 when I was diagnosed.  I'm now 2 1/2 years out from my diagnosis and I'm doing great.   It's a very tough and personal decision -  you will come to the right decision for you ... I would encourage you to discuss the Oncotype DX test with your doctor and possibly even consider participating in the TailorX trial -  the trial is about followup and coming up with some standard recommendations for the cutoff on where chemo really is beneficial.   Hugs, Doreen  ",

It sounds crazy - but once you've got all of the specifics and have a treament plan in place it does get much easier.   I'm not saying you won't have times where you're anxious, scared, angry or any other emotion that you'll experience - just saying it gets easier as you have a plan.  There's a forum here for young women - you might also want to take a look at that if you haven't found that forum yet.   Sending you lots of hugs and support - let us know if you have any questions and don't be shy about expressing your feelings ... this is a safe place to vent!  Hugs, Doreen  ",

Let me know if I can help with any other info.   I'm really sorry you had to join us here -  but glad you found us.  You'll find this site to have a ton of information, support and answers to pretty much any question you can ask.
