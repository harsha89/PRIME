Well, today is day 19 and I still have hair.  I had cut it very short last Tuesday thinking on Thursday it would be gone (day 14).  Strands are falling each day, but not enough to make me wear something yet.  Who knows, maybe I'll just have my 3 year old draw on it with a sharpie and show the world!  I'm surprised I think I'm the only triple negative on this forum!  I guess since there is only 20% of us out there, chances are slim to meet someone on this site who is.  I have been to the triple negative forum, but not too many there either.

So, I said screw it, I'm not wearing them (for now), and I haven't.  I have had several people tell me I look like GI Jane.  Also have heard \"well at least you have a nice shaped head\".  At least I'm cleaning it up all the time.  I will update my photo so you all can see me. Hello Newbies!!!  So many of us...I can't seem to read and scroll down and post, etc.   So for today I will just say that it is not as bad as you think before starting chemo.  It sucks, but it is doable.  How many of you are having radiation treatments following chemo?     I will be getting 36 tx that will start about September 24.

Eph3_12:  I understand the hair thing as I shaved mine down to a mear stubble on Tuesday.  It's not the easiest thing to see yourself like, but it could be worse.  My DH tells me how cute I look all the time and that it doesn't matter what it is on the outside, it is what is inside that counts.  We have been married 25 years this Sept and are just as in love with each other now as we were then. Nothing tastes good, but I keep trying to eat.  Keep brushing my teeth and rinsing with Biotene which helps. Days 7-20 are the best I think. Good luck to all starting Chemo and all that are along with me!   (((HUGS)))",

I also postponed my chocolates for one week as I didn't get my chocolate until Tuesday and Tuesday evening my son totalled his car (was mine).  He severed a utility pole and mailbox and walked away with a broken toe for which we are very thankful.  6 years ago he totalled a truck and was in much worse shape.  12 days in ICU...didn't know if he was going to make it.  Crushed his chin bone and had to have a plate put in and wired shut 12 weeks. Also in wheelchair for 12 weeks as he had so many brakes along his pelvis area as well as his tailbone and hipbone....it was not fun at all.  When he is going to learn...I'm not sure...22 years and hasn't quite figured it out yet.  Although he has opened up lately and I'm hoping that continues because he has always been a nontalker.

Good luck next Thursday with tx 2......then we can say 2 down 2 to go!! I had my neulasta shot the day after and my girlfriend gave it to me.  Wasn't too bad, a little pinch and then it was over.  I really didn't have any SE's from it. RajinCajin:  Welcome!  Sorry you are having such problems with the port and the SEs you are experiencing.  ((((HUGS)))))) All you can do is find out as much as you can about the surgeons and docs you are seeing and pray for all to go well.  I had a lumpectomy and did not have to make as many decision as you may have to make.  Be sure to read lots of posts as most of us are pretty open to answering questions you may have.  Good luck to you! Don't forget girls to order your FREE scarf!  I had a hard time choosing there are so many neat looking ones!  I decided on Jungle today...I'll call for mine later....as a reminder...the site is franceluxe.com....they are really nice on the phone as I inquired about them a couple weeks ago! Hope you all have a great day!!!",

I wish your mom all the best with her first treatment today!  Sending her ((((HUGS)))).  Glad you got her to come on the forum to show her she definately is not alone!!!! My dent seems to be filling in some I think.  It is near my cleavage (what little I have) area, so I'm not sure if it matters where it is as far as how it \"fills\" in.  What pain are you having that you have to take meds?  Just wondering...sorry to hear you are having pain.  My scalp has been itchy as my little stubbles fall out, but that is about it. Shaesalah:  Sorry to hear you are in so much pain (((HUGS))) I think the more water we drink, the faster the SE's move on.  Well, at least I think it has helped me lots. Hope you all have a good of day as you possible can today.  Keep looking at the light at the end of the tunnel....as it will be there for all of us someday!!! GOOD LUCK TRIPLE J's!!!!!!!!!",
