Anyway, I chose to do rads because I wanted to do as much as I possibly could to irradicate this horrible cancer from my body....Every time I was on that table, I envisioned stray cancer cells being burnt to a crisp!  That brought me comfort. And....I breezed through radiation....I finished this past Monday, and I'm doing OK.  I do have some fatigue, and itching...skin is still discolored...but I have to admit that the experience was not a bad one for me.  I had caring techs and nurses, and a great doctor..I saw him once a week, and he was always pleased with how my body was responding to the treatments. When we decided on a lumpectomy....the DCIS was small, unifocal and easy to see, since I do not have dense breasts.....we also knew that rads would follow.....While I was concerned about SE's, particularly fatigue and skin issues...I was willing to give it a try.....Since I cannot take Tamox, I knew radiation would be my only shot at preventing a recurrence.  So...Yes...I am glad I made the decision to do radiation for my very early stage breast cancer...I wanted to throw whatever I could at the monster that had invaded my life so unexpectedly.   Sandy",

We have all been through what you are experiencing...The fear of the unknown is so strong, and so destructive....Tears, depresssion, anger...You name it.....It'a all there.. You can count on the ladies here to be with you throughout your journey...We will try to answer any questions you may have about your treatment (or anything else), and will be here to \"hold\" you when you need to vent.....Many of the ladies are very knowledgeable re. breast cancer, so you will get a lot of good information, too...and the site is great.....There is so much good informaion here.  Finding out you have breast cancer....no matter what the type, stage or grade is devastating   No one ever really thinks it will happen to them....I know I was completely blind-sided, and was in a fog for weeks....Just ask my long-suffering boss! All that you are experiencing is totally normal, and to be expected....After all, you have just recieved a body blow!  It's like being sucker-punched by a ghorilla!!!  The idea is to come up fighting!  And you will... We are so sorry you are here, but want you to know that you need not feel alone...Just come here.  Read, gather information, and ask questions.....And just hang out with us! i don't know your husband, but I am betting that he will not allow your diagnosis to damage your relationship...as you fear.  My own husband is somewhat clueless re. medical things, but he has been a true support...We have been married over forty years, so it would take a lot more than breast cancer to make much difference!   jsut sit down with your husband and tell him how you feel....Share your fears and concerns about your cancer with him....That way, he will feel a part of what is going on....I have found that shairng my feelings with my husband has brought us closer together. We feel we are in this together. My husband has gone with me to all major appointments and procedures...Be sure to include yours in these things....He may not be totally comfortable, but he will go, and that will be a help to you both. Wishing you well....Cry when you want to....yell and scream when you need to...Throw things whenever the mood strikes!   Love and Hugs, Sandy",

Let me tell you a short story....I work for a non-profit that helps low to moderate income people buy their own homes...We provide a hand-up...not a handout....We do lots of education, down-payment assistance and help our clients secure good loans...It is all paid back...As I said, we provide a hand up, and that is so important. My point is that one of our clients is a 75 year old woman who is currently living with her daughter and SIL...She likes it there, but longs to be in her own home again..So...At 75, she is working with us to make that dream come true....Your story reminded me of Janet Grace.....She is going for it, and so should you...I think you would come to regret not taking this wonderful opportunity.
