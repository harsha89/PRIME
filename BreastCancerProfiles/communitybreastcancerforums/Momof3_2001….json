They mentioned at my mammo that a biopsy MIGHT be performed but gave me no definitive info. Should I push for one if they aren't planning to? Also I've never been to a BS. What questions would Be important to ask?? What should i expect at this appointment? Do they usually give you time For questions? Do they give you any information on your specific situation that day or wait Til they have definite answers",

I have an appointment with the Breast Surgeon for more information or possible biopsy (they seemed very vague) on October 11, which seems so far away!!! My maternal aunt passed away from breast cancer in her 40s. I am 29. I have had 2 Fibradenomas in the past that are still there, both are over 5 years old. I have had them ultrasound and checked periodically in that time. They both feel exactly the same and are in identical spots on each breast and are round, rubbery and move around. About 6 weeks ago, I found a new lump that is flatter, ovalish and doesn't quite move the way the others do and sits right on top of the rib. It has also caused a visible indentation about 2 inches long on the outside of the breast. Because it felt differently, I went to the Dr. She sent me for an ultrasound last week, and because they couldn't see it (but they did feel it) they sent me for a diagnostic mammo right away. The said on the US they could see something behind where the lump would be, but not the lump. The mammo turned out negative also, but they gave me a birads 4 and not much information, other than I had dense breasts. I am just curious if others have had any experience with a lump not showing up on both US and mammo and what the outcomes were. Also, has anyone had an indentation and a lump? Ive read about IBC but in most cases of indentations, there was not a lump. Also, any other input you would like to add would be greatly appreciated! Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
