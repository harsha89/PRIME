Is that normal? - Also, since going to the docs last week, I have had shooting pains that feel like they are originating from the 'lump' :-/ so painful that I feel like I stop breathing. - Now (a week today) since I went to get it checked out, I feel like the pain is moving over to the other breast. I have a history of bc in the family, but also, a history of lipomas. I have already had two limpoms out last year, of which one of those was v.painful... &....Over the past 6 months I have had period changes (unbelievavly painful, bed ridden for two days) and lower abdominal pain after eating.  Sorry if it sounds like I'm worrying over nothing, but the pain is driving me to tears. Does anyone think it could be bc? I feel as though I'm just being ignored by my doctor.. Keep well, Lauren Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Apr 4, 2012 07:22AM - edited Apr 4, 2012 07:26AM by Lottielou Hi there, I'm not sure that my abdominal problems are even related to the lump in my breast (in all likelihood there probably not connected at all), I'm awaiting an MRI on my abdomen, as I feel another hard lump there. But I have felt that one for months :-( The one in my breast has only been there to my knowledge about a week and a half. It could have been there longer, but I stupidly haven't been doing self examinations. I'm concurred about the pain in the breast, as the lump is quite large, hard and an odd shape. And the pain comes and goes with differing intensities, sometimes I feel like I'm being stung by a bee or being stabbed and pain shoots all over my breast and armpit. I do have lipomas in my family as my mum and gran have both had the lipomas removed, and I had two removed over a year ago, but they felt round and smaller than this. And afew days before my period my breasts get tender and lumpy and sore.... but never a lump like this, and i'm not due for about 3 weeks still. Yes I agree, I don't understand why my doctor said come back in three weeks either. I just felt 'uurghh :(' if that makes sense. Thanks so much for taking the time to respond.. it means a lot to me. Take care, Lauren x",

I didn't mention this as I thought it was silly, but I just spoke to my friend and she was shocked that the doctor didn't think anything of it..... I suddently developed lactose intolerance... therefore if I have ANYTHING with any amount of dairy/lactose in, I get so so ill and have to go to bed. I don't know whether anyone else on here has ever experienced this, but might say it.... also.. I have become very attracted to sweets (any sort of sweets).. sadly, I feel worse when I have them now..  - I'm hoping it's nothing but its bad now..spent the day at home for the past few days, but feel no better from rest. I don't know what to do. My doctor is 'too busy to see me' :-/ I hate the NHS. Hope you're all doing well.. Lottie x",
