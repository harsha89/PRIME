I know you are scared, and I know the waiting is horrendous.  You will get through this. As difficult as it is, try to take it one day at a time, and one step at a time.  When the anxiety gets too high, try some slow, controlled deep breathing.  Keep repeating to yourself that you can and will get through this.  Find something to distract yourself.  For some, doing fun things (movies, shopping) helps.  I read of one woman who said she had the cleanest toilets while she was waiting for her results.  I'm still at the stage of waiting for the biopsies to be done, but I've found that sorting and organizing old paperwork is a great diversion for me.  At the moment, I'm working on getting through bank records for my husband and I and our kids from a few years ago.  It's tedious and a perfect distraction for me.

This tissue is then looked at under a microscope. The needle used for FNAB is thinner than the ones used for blood tests. . . A fine needle aspiration biopsy can sometimes miss a cancer if the needle is not placed into the area of cancer cells. If it does not provide a clear diagnosis, or your doctor is still suspicious, a second biopsy or a different type of biopsy should be done.\" A stereotactic core needle biopsy uses x-ray equipment and a computer to analyze the pictures (x-ray views). The computer then pinpoints exactly where in the abnormal area to place the needle tip. This procedure is often used to biopsy microcalcifications (calcium deposits). \" Just for your own information, my radiologist suggested a stereotactic biopsy for me too.  My gyn recommended I have a consultation with a surgeon.  He told me that while he prefers a stereotactic biopsy when possible, because it is less invasive, in my case my breasts are too small.  He said he'd hate to have them try several times, only to tell me that they couldn't get a sample.  Me too!!  I had a wire guided excisional biopsy (times 2) for clusters of microcalcifications.  (My results were benign, but with ADH - atypical ductal hyperplasia.)  I'm from another part of Florida, so I haven't heard of Dr. Masood.  Best of luck to you.  I know this is scary, and it's very stressful.  Please try to remember that 80% of biopsies are benign.  Hang onto that thought, and I hope and pray that your results are in that category, BENIGN!

Be prepared for the fact that if it is your normal screening mammo, they might not be able to read it right away.  Be pleasantly surprised if they can, but prepared for the fact that you might have to wait.  We all know that the waiting is horrible, but somehow we all manage to get through it.

When a radiologist reads the films, s/he decides if there is anything of enough concern to warrant a biopsy at this time.  Apparently your radiologist wasn't overly concerned, otherwise s/he would have recommended a biopsy instead of a follow-up in 6 months. The BI-RAD system for mammograms is as follows: Category 0:  Need additional imaging Category 1:  Negative Category 2:  Benign finding Category 3:  Probably benign, short term follow up                                 recommended Category 4:  Suspicious abnormality - biopsy should be                     considered Category 5:  Highly suggestive of malignancy -                     appropriate action should be taken It sounds like your BI-RAD score was a 3.  Many women who have a score of 4 and undergo a biopsy end up with benign results.  Even a score of 5 on a mammogram doesn't mean you have a malignancy.  The ONLY way to tell if something is benign or malignant is to have a biopsy and have a pathologist look at the tissue under a microscope. If this was your first mammogram, the radiologist didn't have anything to compare your films to - which can make it difficult to read.  Plus, given your age, your breast tissue is dense, which can also make it difficult to interpret your films.  Having another mammo in 6 months will allow the radiologist to compare those films against the ones you just had taken.  That, in turn, will allow him/her to see if anything has changed.  Make a list of specific questions you have for your gyn at your appointment Monday.  Keep in mind you do not have a diagnosis of cancer, or even a suggestion that you need a biopsy.  Right now, all you have is a report that says the radiologist wants another set of films in 6 months to see anything has changed. Please keep breathing, and don't get ahead of yourself.  Have fun with your kids this weekend.  Dukemom",

After my first excisional biopsy, I was very concerned about the scar and doing everything I could to minimize its appearance.  I faithfully applied Kelo-cote gel to it daily (like Mederma).  A month later, the surgeon went back into that incision a second time and I got a new incision in another spot, same breast.  Now I have a stereotactic site (same breast) that only stopped oozing blood after 5 days.  I still have the steri strips on.  I've given up on appearances.  At this point I look at my breast and think I'm lucky it's still there.  Although if things keep up at this rate, as small chested as I am, there won't be much left! Ouch on re-suturing without the benefit of even a local.  Just be glad that they caught the infection before it got any worse.  After you have fully healed, ask your surgeon when you can start applying a scar minimizing cream or gel.  Kelo-cote is more expensive than Mederma, but it works very well: http://www.kelocote.com/ However if you are interested in buying some, it's cheaper here: http://www.makemeheal.com/mmh/product.do?id=10066  Be sure to check with your surgeon before applying anything to the incision.  Especially since your incision was reopened and re-sutured, you will have to wait longer after the stitches are out before you can put something on it.  Hang in there Michelle.  Dukemom",

When my daughter was 21, her gyn found a lump in her breast during her annual checkup.  She had an ultrasound, and like you, was told it was a solid mass.  She was given 3 choices:  watch it for 6 months, and then have a repeat ultrasound to see if it had changed; biopsy the lump; or have a lumpectomy.  She felt very strongly that if there was something in her breast that shouldn't be there - she wanted it removed.  She had a lumpectomy, and the pathology came back that it was a benign fibroadenoma.  She didn't care that she had surgery for something that ended up being benign; she was very happy that she had it removed.  As you will read on this board, the odds are very much in your favor that the biopsy will come back benign.  Do you have your appointment yet for your consultation with the surgeon?  This website is fantastic, not only for information, but also for caring and support from people who have been where you are now.  We know how scary it is.  Take several deep breaths, and try to take things one step at a time.  Please check back often, and keep us updated.  Feel free to share your fears here, along with your questions.  Everyone here understands.

They are divided into two categories, macrocalcifications and microcalcifications. Macrocalcifications are coarse calcium deposits that most likely represent degenerative changes in the breasts, such as aging of the breast arteries, old injuries, or inflammations. These deposits are associated with benign (noncancerous) conditions and do not require a biopsy (surgery that removes the tissue for examination under a microscope). Macrocalcifications are found in about 50 percent of women over the age of 50, and in about 10 percent of women under the age of 50. Microcalcifications are tiny specks of calcium in the breast. These minute calcifications are usually in an area of rapidly dividing cells. When many microcalcifications are seen in one area, they are referred to as a cluster and they may indicate a small cancer. About half of the cancers detected by mammography appear as a cluster of microcalcifications. An area of microcalcification that is seen on a mammogram does not always mean that cancer is present. In some cases, the microcalcifications do not even indicate a need for a biopsy. Instead, a doctor may advise a follow-up mammogram within 3 to 6 months. In other cases, the microcalcifications are more suspicious and a biopsy is recommended.\" My routine mammogram a few weeks ago showed a cluster of microcalcifications in the upper outer quadrant of my right breast.  I'm having a cone compression mammogram and an ultrasound tomorrow.  When my gyn told me I'd need to go in for these additional tests, she also told me I'd have to follow up with a surgeon.  So, I'm guessing there is a biopsy in my immediate future too.  Let me know when you are scheduled for your biopsy.  I'll be thinking good thoughts for you!

One thing that bothered me slightly about the stereotactic biopsy was that the radiology department seemed to be the one pushing for that route over a surgical biopsy.  She said \"with the stereotactic biopsy, we can get you in sooner than a surgeon can, and we can get the results to you more quickly than a surgeon would\".  That seemed like a bit of a hard sell to me, but then again - it's probably just me.  It's not like I am overly rational and objective in this department.  (The radiology department is a part of The Breast Health Center at the local hospital - a hospital that was ranked in the top 50 for cancer care last year.)

Things moved fairly quickly for you, once you made the decision to go ahead with the bilateral.  I guess that is a good thing, to not have it drag out.  Are you doing well? Karen - I don't mind you asking; I'm going to the Breast Health Center at Sarasota Memorial.  Last year Sarasota Memorial was in the top 50 hospitals in the country for both cancer and geriatrics.  As my husband likes to say, they should be good with geriatrics, since there are so many 'elderly' folk here.  I'm 50 years old, and I feel like a youngster living here.  Denise - Ramble away anytime.  Some months (weeks, days) are longer than others.  Luckily we all have each other to get us through. I've lost a fair amount of weight lately, so my poor breasts are much smaller than they used to be, and very sad and droopy.  I'm not sure if I'd have much of anything left if they did an excisional biopsy.  Our kids both graduated (undergraduate) from Duke, but neither played sports.  They LOVE Duke Basketball, and are were Cameron Crazies while they were there, but that was about it.  Our family is still very bitter about the way Duke treated the lacrosse team.  After donating to Duke's annual fund for over a decade, we told them we will never give the school another penny. Thanks again for all the information and good thoughts.  I'll let you know what I decide as soon as I talk to my doctor.  Any bets as to when that will be? ",

Many women have lumpy breasts, also described as fibrocystic breasts.  It is very common.  (My gyn told me that palpating my breasts is like feeling a bowl of lumpy oatmeal - lovely analogy!)  Also, cysts are common in younger breasts, and they tend to change with your hormones and cycles.  This is why she wants to check it after your cycle, because it might no longer be there. In any case, you have every right to ask for some type of imaging, to see what is going on.  A mammogram isn't often done on women younger than 50, because your breasts are more dense and it is more difficult to see an abnormality/mass on a mammogram (it's been described as trying to find a polar bear in a snow storm).  Fibroadenomas are also fairly common - they are perfectly benign lumps.  Since many of us here feel that the only good lump is a lump in a jar (i.e. if you have a lump, have it biopsied so you know for sure), I would ask for an ultrasound.  An ultrasound can show the location of a mass, and can also tell if the mass if solid, or if it is filled with liquid (a cyst).  If it is a cyst, they can insert a tiny needle and aspirate (remove) the fluid.  If it is solid, by all means you can request a biopsy.  While it is important to get it checked out, please remember that overall, 80% of all breast biopsies are BENIGN.  Those are wonderful odds.  It's normal that you are very frightened now, but I can tell that you are going to pursue this and put your mind to rest.  Take a few deep breaths, and know that you will be alright.  Come here to ask any questions, to share your fears and anxieties with us, or just to hang out.  We all understand how you feel, and we'll be right here with you.

I'm sorry you had to wait; it can be a little slow here on the weekends. What did your doctor tell you when he/she gave you your ultrasound report?  Has it been suggested that you have the lesions biopsied?  An ultrasound can tell the radiologist whether a mass is solid, or if it is filled with liquid - a cyst.  Cysts are almost always benign, but would likely be aspirated (have the fluid withdrawn with a needle) and have the fluid checked under a microscope. Your ultrasound report says that you have two solid lesions.  I would imagine that you will have them biopsied.  The only way to be certain if a mass is malignant or benign is to biopsy it:  take a tiny piece of tissue and have a pathologist look at it under a microscope.  Many of us here feel the only good lump is a lump in a jar - meaning all lumps should be biopsied and checked.  There are a couple of ways to biopsy a lump, depending on the location of the lump and the size of your breast.  Here's a link with information on biopsies: http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/biopsy/biopsy_methods.asp I know this is scary.  Please remember that overall, 80% of all breast biopsies are benign.  The odds are very much in your favor, but it is very smart to get any breast lump checked out.  Feel free to post any and all questions you may have, or to just share your anxieties and fears.  Best of luck to you, and please keep us posted!

I know you are frightened and worried.  We all are when this happens.  These are our bodies, and it's scary. Try to take some slow deep breaths and don't get too far ahead of yourself.  I was called back from my normal annual mammogram (in March) for diagnostic mammos to check out a suspicious area.  The radiologist read the first set of diagnostic films and found two other areas, so I had another set of films taken while I was still there.  I was told before I left that day that I'd need the areas biopsied.  (My biopsies are scheduled for next week.)  The good news is that with the diagnostic mammograms you very often get the results while you are there!  Some women may have a biopsy the same day, but that wasn't my experience.  I was referred to a surgeon, who discussed the various options for biopsies.  It turns out only one option would work for me - the excisional biopsy. The only way to tell for sure that something is benign is to do a biopsy.  The way your report reads, it sounds to me as if the radiologist was saying that the area in question appears to be benign, but since it has grown slightly since you last exam, it warrants a further look.  With the diagnostic mammogram, they get a magnified view of the specific area, so they get more detail and can better evaluate it. It's very normal for you to be worried.  Your husband is going to be concerned too.  The uncertainty, fear, and waiting are very hard.  However, you will get through this.  I have found incredible strength, encouragement, and comfort from the wonderful people in this community.  Come here for information and to share your fears.  Sharing what we are going through seems to lighten the burden.  We are all here for you.  Please let us know how you make out!

I'm not thrilled with the appearance of mine after the lumpectomy, but I too am glad it was done.  (Of course, I have to see the surgeon again in a few weeks for a couple of things that showed up on the MRI - so who knows what it will look like if he goes back in for a re-excision and also goes into a different area on the same breast.) My mother is so oblivious I don't even discuss my feelings with her.  When I told her that there were 2 areas of concern on my MRI, and that the oncologist's office ordered an ultrasound (and the surgeon's office called and told me he wanted to see me again) - she had the most interesting response:  \"well, at least you know there isn't anything to worry about\".  I asked her why I don't have anything to worry about.  She replied, \"he was just in there, and didn't see anything else\".  I started to attempt to explain that malignant cells aren't visible to the naked eye, and that a pathologist needs to look at tissue to determine if there is a malignancy; I also attempted to point out that the other area is in a totally different part of the breast.  She just doesn't get it, so I stopped trying. It's frustrating when family, especially our mothers, don't get it.  As you said, luckily we have each other. Will you get the pathology report today?  I am hoping for good news for you.  It's been over 3 weeks for me since the surgery, and my breast doesn't look as foreign to me now as it did when I first saw it.  I hope the same will be true for you. Hang in there!

I learned from last time to have a very soft pillow for my arm to rest on in bed.  That helps me stay on the correct side, and keeps me from bumping my boob with my arm during the night.  (I also had a nice nap this afternoon.) I hope there is a cancellation and you can get your biopsy done earlier.  Regardless, please try to keep yourself busy and distracted.  Here's hoping the monkeys behave themselves and leave you alone.  If not, don't be afraid to take the Ativan as needed - that's what it's for.  If you have any questions, or want to talk, feel free to PM me.

Two of the areas biopsied were nice and boring, and included \"patchy dense fibrosclerosis, cyst formations, apocrine metaplasia, small fibroadenoma, and fibroadenomatous change\". The other area wasn't quite as boring.  The report on that piece of tissue (4.5 x 3.0 x 2.5 cm) included:  atypical ductal hyperplasia present less than 1 mm from the margin; fibrosclerosis, apocrine metaplasia and adednosis; focally tubular.  This tissue sample then said \"See Comment\".  The comment for that tissue sample was, \"An immunostain for cytokeratin 5/6 was performed on the ductal hyperplastic lesion and is mainly negative.\" From my time reading these boards, I know that in a path report there are often more questions raised, even with benign results.  While I am thrilled and grateful that I have no malignancy, I do have a couple of questions for the surgeon next week. 1)  Do I need to be concerned that the ADH was found less than 1 mm from the margin? 2)  Do I need to be concerned that the immunostain (which I believe is used to differentiate ADH from DCIS) was \"mainly negative\"?  I'd feel better if I knew what percentage was negative and what percentage was positive. 3)  I'm going to inquire as to whether or not I should pursue genetic testing.  My maternal grandmother died of metastatic bc.  My mother has a first cousin who dies of metastatic breast cancer (diagnosed in her early 30s):  she had one type in one breast; 4 years later she was diagnosed with a different type in the other breast; she underwent genetic testing before she died of the disease - and was told that she did have the gene for bc.  (That is all the family knows of her illness; they are amazingly uninformed considering she tested positive for the gene.  They have, however, requested her medical records from where she was treated, and they will forward the records to me as soon as they get them.) Any and all thoughts and suggestions on other questions for my surgeon will be greatly appreciated. I want to thank you all for your kind thoughts and prayers.  I appreciate all the wisdom and experience everyone so willingly shares here.  As I said earlier, I am thrilled that I have no malignancy.  However, I don't know that I'll ever completely relax, especially given my family history.  I plan to stay around on the boards, to continue to learn what I can about this horrible disease, and to support others who have abnormalities and have to undergo further testing.

He sent my slides to Johns Hopkins, and the new report came back that it was something completely different.  Thankfully, it was still a benign growth, and it required no special follow-up, but I found it very disturbing that the local lab had gotten it so wrong. It's great that they are keeping such a close eye on you, with 6 month checks on both breasts for life.  I know you will go into each check up holding your breath, waiting to learn if they see anything suspicious.  I don't know if we will ever lose that fear, but it's important to be monitored closely so that any abnormalities can be found early. Be sure to take it extra easy while your body does double duty:  heal and fight the infection!!  Please keep us posted. Dukemom",

If your MRI is ordered with and without contrast (as most are), they will start an IV on you before you get on the table.  They will take one set of films, then they will add a contrast material through the IV, and take another set of films.  I had no sensation whatsoever of the contrast being added to the IV. The entire thing was over in about 45 for me. I had my MRI on Tuesday.  My doctors received the written report from the radiologist Friday morning.  When I got my copy of the report, I noted that the radiologist had signed off on the report at 8:30 PM Thursday, the previous night.  I had been told that reports are usually ready in 2-3 days, and that the doctors will normally have them in 3-5. I'm sorry that you have been diagnosed with DCIS.  The MRI will let them know if there any other areas of concern.  Hopefully, your MRI won't show any other problems, and you can get on with plotting your course of treatment.  Best of luck to you.  Please let us know how you are doing!

You should also start a notebook and get and keep copies of all your reports (mammograms, ultrasounds, pathology reports, etc.).  You can either get them from your doctor's office, or some of us have been known to go directly to the Medical Records Department at the hospital (when the doctor takes too long to give us the results).   It's a good idea to have a copy of everything yourself, to help you know where you are and to have things in writing.  Just listening to the results, even when they are perfectly benign, can be a little overwhelming.  It's nice to be able to re-read reports, and look up terms, and better understand what is going on.  Even if (WHEN!) everything comes back benign, you will have the records in case you ever have another issue. My diagnostic mammogram was BI-RAD 4.  In order to show the surgeon exactly where the microcalcifications were located, the radiologist inserted wires (after numbing the breast), using the mammogram machine to guide the wire placement.  He was pleased with himself when he was able to \"get\" two of the clusters with one wire - so I only needed two wires.  The pathology report on one piece of tissue came back with a lot of very impressive sounding words, but everything was benign (YEA!!).   The other piece of tissue had a focus of ADH, atypical ductal hyperplasia.  ADH isn't malignant, but it's considered pre-malignant and puts one at increased risk of developing breast cancer in either breast, not just the breast with the ADH.  Because of that increased risk, and because of some family history, my surgeon referred me to an oncologist.  The oncologist ordered an MRI, to be sure there wasn't anything else going on.  Besides showing 2 seromas at the surgical site (normal post-op accumulations of fluid), the MRI also showed an enhancement at the edge of the surgical site that was \"suspicious for residual malignancy or carcinoma in situ\".  The MRI also showed a mass in another spot in the same breast.  That led to an ultrasound, which confirmed the location of the mass, and that the mass was solid and not a cyst.  Now I am waiting for my surgeon to return from vacation.  I have an appointment with him on his first day back, June 23rd.   Sometimes the fun just keeps coming.   I pray that your results are clearly benign, with nothing questionable!!  That is the best kind of report. Even though my faith has been a constant throughout my life, this has been a life changing experience for me; it has changed the way I view many things. Many of us, even those who have never before had a problem with anxiety, find that we need something to help us as we go through this process.   There is nothing wrong with asking for a prescription - our doctors know how stressful a time this is.  I have found that Xanax helps to shush the monkeys.  There are other anti-anxiety meds that are equally effective.  I hope you can muzzle the monkeys long enough to get some sleep tonight.  If you are overtired, it only makes the anxiety and stress that much worse (and it seems to make the monkeys a bit louder too). I have to admit, I keep all my what-ifs to myself.  I don't share them with anyone.  I don't think anyone, other than the wonderful women here, would ever understand.  I found myself going through a lot of old files of papers and organizing things.  I also did a lot of shredding of old documents.  Some women have the cleanest homes in town, others employ some good old fashioned retail therapy.  Then there is always exercise to burn off some excess stress, meditation, deep breathing. . . You need to find what works best for you.  What works for one person won't help the next.  Please don't ask me to clean!!  Dukemom",

Just remember that your specialist, whether a man or woman, still puts his or her pants on one leg at a time!  Also remember that not all surgeons have the best bedside manner.  Many do, and that is wonderful when that happens.  But some surgeons, while technically superb at what they do, can't always muster a warm and fuzzy relationship with patients.  I haven't found a way to stop the what ifs.  They still pop into my mind from time to time.  I try to pull up my intellectual side and put things in perspective.  I'm not always successful.  Sometimes those stupid monkeys distract me and my mind wanders off to one of those dark places I don't want to visit.  Although the drug info, your doctor, and your pharmacist will tell you otherwise, I've heard stories of women who have a glass of wine with a low dose anti-anxiety med.  It makes the monkeys shut up a little more quickly, and it makes it easier to sleep.    The key is only one glass of wine (and not a 20 oz glass), and a low dose of Xanax or whatever you are prescribed.  If you have never taken the med before, I'd recommend you take the med alone for the first day to see how if affects you.  Until you do get a script, I can also confirm that a glass of wine before bed (or a glass of chilled Baileys, yum!) will also help quiet the monkeys.

At least you have had the diagnostic films and an ultrasound.  Some women have to wait long periods of time between each step; you are a little ahead in that department. It is especially hard that this is your first mammogram, because the radiologist has nothing to compare it to.  Do you have an appointment to talk with a breast surgeon?  That will probably be your next step - to let him/her look at your films with you and decide how best to proceed.  My mammo showed 3 clusters of microcalcifications (radiologist recommended biopsies of all 3).  Unfortunately, the surgeon said that my breast is too small for a stereotactic biopsy.  He said that a stereo is a good option for a biopsy, as it is less invasive than an excisional biospy (surgery to remove the entire questionable tissue).  He said he'd hate to send me for a stereo, only to have them make several tries and then decide that they couldn't get the cannula in at the right angle to get to samples needed.  (Me too!!).  So, I had the excisional biopsies.  If you need more info on stereotactic biopsies: http://www.radiologyinfo.org/en/info.cfm?pg=breastbixr&bhcp=1 The not knowing what you are dealing with is very difficult, and can be when the chattering monkeys get the loudest.  For me, I need to learn what I can about my options, so that I am comfortable that I am making the best decision for me. Once you have made a decision as to how you want to proceed, whether it be waiting (which you don't sound like you are in favor of - few of us here are big fans of waiting), or having a stereo, or having an excisional - I think you will feel a little more in control.  You are allowed to feel like \"poor me\"!  You are allowed to feel any and all emotions.  Whatever you are feeling is normal.  No matter what your emotions, there are many here who have or do feel the exact same way.  You are never alone here.  (Although things are a little quieter here on the weekends.  While there is always someone who will come along, on the weekends it may take a little longer.) I'm sending calming and benign thoughts your way, along with a hug! Dukemom",

If you have been wearing a snug bra 24/7, limiting your activity and haven't lifted anything, and you are still as sore as you were the first couple of days post-op, I'd call the surgeon and ask if that is normal for you.  Perhaps he/she did more 'fishing' around in there, and that is why you are still so sore.  It's also possible that you may have bled some into the sites.  In any case, I would call the surgeon for my own peace of mind.  He/she may have you wait until your appointment later next week, or may want you to come in on Monday and get it checked. I think it's very natural to have raised scars at this point in the healing.  If you have healed enough so the surgeon has said it is ok to put a cream or gel on the scar to help minimize its appearance ( Kelo-coat scar gel, Mederma or a similar product), that will help to reduce the scar and fade the color.  Be sure to have your surgeon's permission before you start to put anything like that on your incision. Good luck, and let us know what he/she says! Dukemom",

Here's another thought:  was the biopsy done in a hospital?  If so, you can go to the Medical Records office of the hospital and request a copy of your pathology report.  It will be on file, and they can't deny you a copy - even if it's your surgeon's policy to talk to you before he gives you a copy of your report.  If it was done in a hospital, Medical Records will have a standard release form you have to complete in order to get a copy of your path report.  You will need to show a photo ID, and most Medical Records Departments charge a minimal copy fee (my hospital charges $1.00 per page, plus tax).  Here's hoping that it was done in a hospital, and you can get yourself there today and get a copy of your report. Then you can go home and write an even better letter to your surgeon.  Dukemom",

I'm not sure what community programs might be available to help with this, but I'm sure some others will come along who could advise you better in that department. In the meantime, do what you can to educate yourself on breast cancer, so you will be able to help your mom make the upcoming decisions that she will be facing.  This website offers many free publications, which help explain what lies ahead.  Take advantage of them. Your mother is very fortunate to have you as her advocate.  Stay close to her, and do your best to help her through this.  If it turns out that she is clinically depressed, and she gets treatment for that, you may find that she is no longer a negative person.  You, your mom, and your family will be in my prayers.  Please keep checking back, and let us know how you are both doing.

The fact that you can feel any lump at all - by all means keep your appointment and get it biopsied.  As many here are fond of saying, \"the only good lump is a lump in a jar\". Our moms can be kind of clueless about breast health issues, and I'm not sure why.  I watched my maternal grandmother die of breast cancer when I was a child, yet my mother is oblivious (and not very supportive).  This is not in your head.  When you can feel a lump,  when you have a radiologist recommending a biopsy, it's not in your head.  We all understand, and we all have been where you are now - scared, confused, going crazy. . .   You are not alone in this.  When is your biopsy?  What type of biopsy are you going to have?  I'm sending calming and benign thoughts your way.

Additionally, many women have no symptoms of ovarian cancer until the cancer is very advanced - but which time it can already have metastasized.  If it were me, I'd have my ovaries removed ASAP.  The surgery can be done laparoscopically, and it's just not worth of keeping your ovaries -especially since you know you carry the BRCA1 gene. ",

My father (now deceased) was a patient a couple of times at HeathSouth.  My husband and I joke that the hospitals and rehab facilities here are so nice because they get so much business.  The population trends towards the very elderly side!  I think the pain is worse in the evening because as much as you may be resting during the day, you are still up and moving.  Even with a very snug and firm bra, you are moving that poor sore breast, and it lets you know about it! I hope the half a pain pill and ice are keeping you comfortable.  Continue to take it easy, and let your family pick up the slack so you can heal. Dukemom",

Please make sure she gets her MRI soon.  I know she is scared, but this is no time for her to bury her head in the sand.  Not having the MRI (or biopsy, if the radiologist feels one is needed) will not change the outcome.  If there is a problem, the sooner it is found and dealt with, the better. Prayers that the lumps are perfectly benign.  In the meantime, hold her hand if need be, and help her get to her MRI.  You are a great sister! Dukemom",

It's normal to be nervous and to worry.  We all do, even though we try to talk ourselves down.  It will be ok.  Just mentally prepare yourself for the worst case tomorrow, that you are told you need a biopsy.  If so, ask your gyn or your internist to recommend a breast surgeon - if you don't already know of one.  Then, make an appointment.  He/she will look at your films, go over the radiologist's report with you, and tell you what he/she recommends as the best method of biopsy for you.  Please try not to get too far ahead of yourself.  Remember that overall, approximately 80% of breast biopsies are BENIGN.  It's good to know what you are dealing with, and it's good to be prepared for the next step of options/choices that you might face.  We all have a tendency to think worst case scenarios, and have our minds wander off to dark places they don't need to be.  Try to just deal with what is ahead of you now.  We're right here with you as you go through this. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions.  I'm sending good thoughts and hugs your way. Dukemom ",

Talk to your doctor, and see if she is comfortable with you waiting until June to have the testing done.  If not, you can always talk to your insurance company and ask what their current policy is.  Not that I don't trust insurance companies, but if they tell you that a positive outcome of genetic testing won't affect your insurance coverage at all - I'd ask for that in writing.
