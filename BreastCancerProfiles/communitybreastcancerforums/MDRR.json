But when the surgical pathology showed it had become invasive and was stage 1, I opted for a bilateral mastectomy (instead of further surgery to try and get clean margins), and that included sentinel node biopsy. The SNB showed involvement in 2 nodes, but very initial involvement. My surgeon indicated the initial diagnosis (stage 0) and lumpectomy did not indicate the need for lymph node biopsy, but again, the pathology drove the need for further surgical involvement.",

We all know from our initial testing that the waiting is definitely the hardest part. I'm glad you have appointments scheduled so you can get to the bottom of this quickly.

My experience was an initial diagnosis of DCIS and I had both a biopsy and MRI prior to seeing the breast surgeon. The diagnosis was from these tests, but the pathology on my lumpectomy came back with a diagnosis of invasive, stage 1. so it had either advanced in the 8 weeks of testing, or they needed more tissue to completely diagnose. Either way, the diagnosis did unfold as the process went further. The main thing is to take each step as it comes, ask all the questions you need to ask in order to be comfortable, and make informed decisions. Keep us posted!",

No family history and no other health issues, so truly a surprise. I was pretty surprised at my reaction, which was 'ok, so what do we need to do?' So after a lumpectomy, the pathology returned that it had become invasive -- was on the move. My surgeon and I decided on a mastectomy, and that went very well. Again, I was surprised at how easily the surgery went. I'm kind of used to surgeries; I've been an athlete all my life and so have had 5 knee surgeries. Maybe I just have it ingrained in me that we just need to fix it and move on? Not sure. But I decided against reconstruction -- I wanted to get on with everything and get back out on the field. Being a member of a senior traveling softball team (all of us age 60+) definitely helped -- many peers who got involved to support, encourage, laugh and help me get back out on the field. My goal was a planned hike to the bottom of the grand canyon scheduled for 3 months post-mastectomy. My surgeon was all-in for getting me down there (and back!) and fortunately, I was able to do it. Now I'm on arimidex and while it crosses my mind periodically in terms of the 'what ifs', I guess this experience has helped me realize that you can 'what if' yourself crazy, so I try to focus on moving forward and enjoying each day. It's only been a year since diagnosis and 9 months since surgery, but so far so good. I'm glad we have this forum to support each other!",

I had an abnormal mammogram, dense breast tissue, etc. Was called back for another look, then a biopsy, then another biopsy, then an MRI, before finally seeing the surgeon. Each test was a little more involved, but the technicians were all very experienced and gentle. One even spent 20 minutes after a biopsy gently putting pressure on the breast to remove as much of the bleeding as possible so I wouldn't get a bruise -- and it worked. Interestingly, I didn't get particularly anxious, but I did feel so fortunate when I thought of all the women who don't have access to these diagnostics -- I found that realy bothered me. Maybe because I hadn't had any health issues until then (I'm 62), I didn't really expect any problems. But ultimately I did have early stage breast cancer and the pathology on my lumpectomy showed it had become invasive, leading to the mastectomy. Try to take it one step at a time and try not to look to far forward at the \"what ifs\" -- you can drive yourself crazy. Surround yourself with a good medical team and supportive family and friends, and whatever they find, you'll be able to make informed decisions that are best for you.
