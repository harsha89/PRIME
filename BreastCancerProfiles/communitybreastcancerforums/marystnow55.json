The original biopsy taken showed an aggressive cancer but the remaining tumor that was removed showed no cancer cells and the lymph nodes didn't show any cancer cells, Stage one. I have just finished my last Taxol which followed Adriamycin and Cytoxin. Now they want me to do Radiation. I don't understand why it is needed if there wasn't any Cancer cells found in the remaining Tumor or the Lymph Nodes and the 10 treatments of Chemo that is supposed to kill any old or new Cancer Cells anywhere in my body including the Tumor site. Has anyone been in this same situation?? I feel the Radiation is just overkill. Thanks for any input. Log in to post a reply",
