      "Content": "Jan 3, 2010 09:17AM - edited Jan 3, 2010 09:18AM by NativeMainer Icey, there are many chemotherapy regimens, using different combinations and doses of the drugs.  All chemotherapy drugs kill multiplying cells.  Since cancer cells are multiplying faster than most normal cells chemo drugs affect them the most, but they also affect healthy fast multiplying cells like those in mucus membranes, the intestines and hair follicles.  That's why chemo has the side effects of nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, hair loss, mouth ulcers.  Because the bone marrow is an area where cells are mulitplying rapidly chemo also causes anemia and low white blood cell counts and low platelet counts.  Not everybody needs a port to get chemo.  I've given chemo to patients once a week for a year without needing a port.  It depends on how good your veins are, how often you will get chemo and lab tests done, how willing you are to have multiple tries to get lab work or IV starts as time goes by.  Most people (and nurses) prefer a port--one stick access every time.  Make sure your lab knows you have one if you get one, most labs will not use a port and you have to get your blood draws where you get chemo instead of in the lab.  The down side is that the port, unless handled carefully every time, is the leading source of infection during chemo. Low dose chemo uses small doses of the drugs.  This kills fewer cancer cells, but also kills fewer healthy cells and so has the fewest side effects.  Typical chemo doses kill more cancer cells and more healthy cells, and have more side effects.  High dose chemo uses doses that are toxic or even fatal unless counteracted by another medication--methotrexate is one drug used this way, with folic acid given to counteract it after a few hours.  If all the doses are calculated correctly many cancer cells are killed quickly and some healthy cells are killed, but many are \"saved\" by the folic acid just before they die.  ",

You need more information--you may want to see the med onc again. There are many treatment regimens for bc, you need to know the pros & cons of each and why each is or is not applicable to you, with the side effect profile of each.   Also, there is more and more research that when bc recurrs after chemo it is harder to treat.  The recurrent bc cells will not respond to the chemo given earlier.  There's a growing body of evidence that early stage bc should not be treated with chemo,  If a recurrence does occur, the chemo choices are larger since the cells have not been exposed to chemo drugs and have not had a chance to become resistant. You also need the pathology results--was it lobular or ductal?  Invasive or in situ? What size?  ER/PER positive or negative?  Her2 positive or negative?  All these make a big difference is treatment choices.  Hormonal blockers will not work if the pathology is ER/PR negative.  There are drugs targeted to treat HER2 positive pathology.  I know all ths is overwhelming.  Keep asking questions.  You'll get through, and it gets easier when you have all the information.  ",

I'm going to ask (insist) that I do not get tattoos for 2 resons--I don't need anymore permanent reminders and every time I have been told that a procedure won't hurt it has been agonizingly painful. I just don't trust what medical people tell me anymore, and have anxiety attacks every time I even think about tattoos. I can deal with ink marks and stains on my bras and clothing. I cannot deal with any more needles or pain. Maybe I'll change my mind down the line. When I was sitting in the waiting room Friday I saw several people that must have been getting rads, because I saw ink dots on many of them. They stood out like neon signs. I suppose I'm just hypersensitive right now, but I get sick when I think of being branded that way for every one to see. I hope my anxiety level starts going down soon, I feel like I'm going to go crazy. Maybe things will get better after the simulation Monday. Dr said it would take a week to 'put a plan together' so I guess I'll be starting actual treatment in May. Thanks for letting me rant and rave and not telling me not to be such a whiner.",

If the docs are planning radiation, the wait is usually 3 to 6 months after it's done to have surgery. ",

Don't forget that the Advance Directive needs to be given to your doctor and to the hospital to be followed.  In Maine an Advance Directive/Living Will is not official UNTIL a copy is filed with a doctor's office or a hospital. Once filed, it is binding on the health care providers and family members cannot make the docs do differently.   Durable POA and estate wills can be done through online sites for a moderate fee, and there are software programs that can be bought that are very inexpensive that will help you write a will.  Most states do not require a lawyer to be involved.  Usually an estate will needs to be notarized, but that is easily done at your bank or doctor's office at no charge.   Every oncology clinic must have access to social workers.  If one hasn't already been assigned, ask to speak with one.  A social worker can help with all of these types of arrangements, and usually have all the forms right in the office.  Another recommendation I would make is to have another person's name put on all the bank accounts.  I put my mother's name on mine so she could access my accounts if necessary while I was in treatment.  My mother has put my name on her accounts for the same reason--so I can access the accounts if she is unable to.  This does not allow me to access her account after she dies, however, the account will be frozen until the will is probated.   All this is distressing to talk about but it really does make a huge difference in family stress levels if the patient can't speak for him/herself.  ",

With wire localization your breast is compressed while a dr inserts a needle, then pictures are taken and the needle mooved around until it is in the place they want it. Then the dr puts a little cap on the needle and it sends electric schocks into your breast every couple of seconds until they take you to surgery and remove the needle and (hopefuly) the area they have marked. NO pain med or sedation for the needle and shocks. For a SNB, you get 4 injections into your breast, 1 udner the nipple, again no pain med or sedation, then you lie in a machine for an hour while they take pictures. This \"lights up\" the sentinel node. Then you go to surgery. All the injections are painful, the nipple one is VERY painful. The burning and pain last about an hour. If I had known what the procedures would be like (very painful) I would not have consented. If these procedures are ever recommended again, they will be done ONLY under sedation or with strong pain medication.",

TheDVD is broken into several sections.  It starts with the usual disclaimer not to do any exercise unless cleared by your doctor.  Measuring Arm & Shoulder Range of Motion In this section the instructor demonstrates normal arm and shoulder movements and full range of motion, instructing the watcher to note where her individual limits are on the operative side and compare to the unaffected side.  The watcher is instructed to write down this info for reference later to show progress.  The demonstation of normal shoulder movement in a 3 dimensional way was intersesting and enlightening.  I thought I had full range of motion on the operative side and discovered I don't, although I come close.  Concentration on the Core Advice for Tram Flab Rehab I only skimmed through this section as I didn't have a reconstructions (lumpectomy).  The instructor does state to wait 10 weeks before starting, and describes what the student can expect to see and feel during recovery and early exercise.  Concentration on the Upper Core This section focuses on upper abd and arm/shoulder movements.  Some movements are very much like the stretches my LE therapist gave me to do, others were more of a work out for me.  I could do all the exercises with minimal adaptation.  The instructor does show adaptations for more limited students, but not until after the demonstration and practice of the full exercise movements.  The Restoration Flow This is the workout section, all put together. It includes all the upper core exercises and adds lower core exercises.  Several of the lower core exercises are done lying face down on the floor, which I cannot do without pain the breast with LE.  Overall, the workout looks to me to be as good as the yoga routines I am already familiar with.  Making Your Restoration Complete In this section the instructor talks, briefly, about lymphedema and demonstrates a 'chest wall massage' said to be to help LE. Some of the massage motions go in the direction opposite lymphatic flow, which I was taught was to be avoided.  The 'massage' starts out by rubbing knuckles in the armpit of the operative side to 'open up' the lymphatic vessels there.  Perhaps it is just because it is quite different from what I was taught that what was shown here seems somehow wrong.  There is a demonstration of putting on an arm sleeve, and the woman is doing things I was taught not to do--pulling on the sleeve and stretching it out  while pulling it up, for instance.  Throughout the video the instructor mentions adaptations for those with LE.  One of the 3 students shown in the Restoration Flow workout section is wearing an arm sleeve.  Overall, the information about how Pilates works was interesting and helpful, as was the demonstration of shoulder motion.  The upper core/shoulder exercises I plan to add to my exercise routine, but the full Restoration Flow workout is something I doubt I will ever be able to do as I cannot lie face down without pain.  The chest wall massage section I plan to ignore totally.  Those of you who ordered the LeBed method DVD probably got a better deal. ",

Why?  The students are complaining that I am not supervisiong them closely enough during med admin.  They're getting patients that are too hard to manage without a second student to help.  Three of the 7 seven stufdents didn't get one of the \"best\" OR rotation slots.  Only one student gets the complex wound care patient when there is one on the unit.  I\"m trying to hurry them up too much and not sweet and pleasant when I'm doing so (this means that I come and get them out of  the break room when there patient rings the call bell).  Somehow I'm supposed to magically fix this and make the last 3 weeks of clinical perfect.   Fuck it.  I've already turned in my resignation for the end of the semester.  I told the director today that I'm not sure I can go back to clinical with this group, and I really don't want to.  Right now I am seriously considering going back to the office over the weekend, packing up all my stuff and disappearing.  Send them all an e-,mail that I am resigning immediately so they can get an instructor who better meets their needs.  (little history--we were 5 weeks into the semester before all the clinical instructor positions were filled.  No way they'll find another instructor to finish the semester. Not that they know that.)   You know what the topper is?  Whoever it was that complained actually told the director that I must be expecting special treatment because I had cancer.   In the mail today is a request to teach a summer session.  7 weeks, once a week for 2.5 hours, getting LPNs up to speed  and ready to jump in at the second year level next fall.  For $825.00,  I'm sending it back with a take this job and shove it note.  ",

Nursing is turning into slaves to the technology rather than using the tech as the tool it is.   There is a big difference between a nurse that can think critically and one who follows procedure. ",

Includes nutritional guidelines plus a 30-minute daily Pilates workout to increase core stability and strength. Excellent for post-op rehab from breast cancer related surgeries including lumpectomy, mastectomy and reconstruction. Dr. Suzanne Martin includes a self test to measure arm range of motion, a chest wall lymphatic massage demonstration, and the foundation for restoring core strength and posture. A safe home Pilates program. 108 minutes. I should get the DVD in a week or so, I can post a review if anyone is interested.  Maybe someone already has it, or has gone to a Pilates instructor trained in this program? ",

Second, call the hospital and ask to speak with a patient advocate.  Every hospital has to have a department whose staff is hired to work with patients on complaints like this.  They may have a little different name, but \"patient advocate\" will get you to the right person.  Or just tell the operator you have a serious complaint to file and you want to talk with someone in authority.  Or check the hospital's website, they often have \"contact us\" sections with direct phone numbers or even a way to file a complaint by e-mail.  If you go the e-mail route, print and copy each e-mail for a paper record.  Then, go onto your state's website and find the Medical Board, the body that licences doctors and file a complaint there. Then find the same organization in your state that licenses hospitals and file a complaint there as well.  Once you make a complaint to the hospital they have to give you the state agency contact info, so you can wait for that if you want. Then call your insurance company, the sooner the better.  If any of your care did not meet thier criteria and standards they may take back any payment they have made for treatments given due to physician neglect.  With the darin being pulled at 100 ml per day, the problems were predictable and the ER visit could easily be prevented.  The hosptial needs to justify to the insurance company their decision not to adequately treat you. If the hospital has a history of this kind of complaint the insurance company may drop them, or will at least cut back their payments to them.  This hits hospitals where they will pay attention.  If you have any contact with the other two women you mention, by all means encourage them to also file complaints.  I've worked in the system long enough to know that if 3 patients make the same complaint about a doctor, nurse, technitian or department that there will be some serious investigation and heads will probably roll, just so that the hospital can say they took care of the issue if it ever hits the media.  I know this sounds like a lot of work to get justice, but it IS an effective strategy.  At the very least it will cause the doctor and hospital a lot of grief.  Keep notes about every step you take, and every person you talk with.  If you send anything by mail include a copy of the notes--every time!  Yes the files get big, but big gets attention  and attention to detail means they can't jerk you around by changing who talks with you and giving you different info each time then claiming you didn't understand.  Hospitals and doctor's lawyer's play nasty, so be prepared to say the same thing over and over and over again and stick to your guns.  Let us know how you make out.",

There are no right or wrong choices.  Hang in there and keep coming back here to talk out your decisions and ask questions.  That's what we're here for. ",

Hope your plan works out as planned. And you are so right that we have to watch out for ourselves when we are patients, but it's so hard to do that effectively when you are in pain, doped up on pain medication, or just plain to scared to think straight.

I read about protein in one of the books I have or online somewhere.  My diet tends to be very bad, no protein, lots of carbs, and every so often I keep a log of what I eat for a few days to see how badly I'm doing.  I did that one week a while ago as a distraction from the LE pain and noticed that I had a little less pain after I went out to dinner one evening.  I was expecting more pain the next day--more salt than usual so probably more swelling, thus more pain--but I actually felt better than usual.  Over the next few day --with little protein in the diet--the pain gradually got worse.  The swelling stays pretty much the same.  I don't count grams, calories or anything else, so I can't speak to your 50 grams per day question, but if that info came from a nutritionist, I would trust it.  It actually makes a lot of sense biologically.  When someone eats too little protein they tend to get swelling in their hands and feet because there is less protein in the blood and more in the cells, so water goes into the cells to help even out the concentrations.  Since LE fluid is high in protein, without enough protein in the blood fluid will go to the protien in the lymph system.  If the lymph system is blocked the extra water will just sit there. ",

I was fortunate to have a lot of support from fellow faculty, I would not have gotten that kind of support from the home care agency I left.  Nurses and healthcare employers can be very unsupportive of nurses who develop an illness.  We're expected to take care of everyone BUT ourselves all the time.  The stress of the way you were treated is certainly adding to your pain.  Are you taking your pain meds regularly?  Taking them on a scheduled basis can help keep pain from getting out of control.  What are you taking for pain med?  Can you add some tylenol or advil?  It's surprising how much help those can be when taken with pain meds.  Just be sure there isn't some already in your pain meds.   Make sure you are taking a stool softener AND a laxative to get the bowels going again, Sennokot S works well. Drink lots of water, too, try for 2 liters per day.  Talk to your PCP about getting on an antidepressant for a while, that will help with pain and with the anxiety/stress/anquish you are experiencing.  Take your time about making any decisions right now.  You have a while, take the time.   edited to remove a stupid statement about checking the Nurses with bc thread, forget where I was for a moment!  Cancer brain strikes again!",

Nursing education is becoming a business of recruiting students, getting their tuition and passing them through.  As long as they pass NCLEX everyone who counts is happy with the school. Nurses have no responsibility to the profession or patients anymore.  ",

One option you have is to have the mastectomies and then take your time resesarching reconstruction techniques.  Most surgeons won't tell you about that option.  Don't let anyone rush you into a choice of recon technique, if you are going to do recon.  If we did a poll of women who had BMX's I'm betting that most had some amount of bc or DCIS/LCIS in the \"uninvolved\" breast.  I'm not sure why it's so surprising to the docs when it happens so often. ",

You have a right to pain management WHILE the cause of the pain is being determined.  Do not leave the exam room until you are satisfied with the results.  The trick is to not leave the exam room.  Do not let them talk you into waiting in the waiting area while they make test referrals or write a prescription for pain medication, it's too easy for you to get brushed off.  If you are in the exam room they cannot put another patient in there and that starts impacting thier financial bottom line, and that gets attention.  I've used this tactic many times, always successfully.  \"I'm not leaving, my appointment isn't over yet because I have not gotten (an answer to my question, or a prescription for my pain, or an appointment for a test,fill in whatever).  I'll leave when I have what I need.\"  ",

I wanted a mastecomy initially, and allowed myself to be talked into the more \"rational\" choice of lumpectomy and radiation.  I had truncal lymphedema along with nerve and blood vessel damage, so I was in for pain and abscesses for the rest of my life or until the breast rotted off, so a mastectomy was my choice, and I had the other breast removed and remade when I had recon so I would not ever have to face that horror again.  But that was the best choice for me, and may not be for you.   Keep us up to date on your progress.  ",

This makes sense how?  Another think I hate is that nurses can give nebulizer treatments on nights or weekends, but not during weekdays when resp therapy is working.  Nurses can't supervise a pt in an exercise program during the week but are expected to on the weekends when PT isn't working.  Smacks way to much of convenience decision making, to my mind.  Sorry you had a bad day, Hanta.  I sympathize. ",
