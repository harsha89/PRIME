I've already called and talked with someone, I don't think it will take long to get the appointment, where I live.  (more rural area)  But I will head your advice and go ahead and call and get it set up for after the 1st.  Surprisingly I feel very calm about it all.  I know God is in total control of my life - He won't give me more than I can handle.... and what ever \"it\" is... He'll carry me through.  On a less serious note... I'm tempted to give this lump a name.... \"Fred\"  \"Harry\"... I don't know... something goofy.  I must admit, I've not been good about self exams... I do them every few months, sometimes only twice a year.... but I have done more exams on myself in the last week, than I have in my whole 41 years of life.  Each time I think \"I need to just make sure that I'm not losing my mind and there's nothing there\".... but each time, \"Lump\" is still there.  (haha... sorry, struck me as funny because my best friend has a dog named \"Lump\".)  Any ideas on names?",
