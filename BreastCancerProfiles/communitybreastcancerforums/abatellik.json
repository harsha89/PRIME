I had to get up every 1 and 1/2 hours to go to the bathroom. But my surgeons were excellent- can't complain there. When the nurses changed my dressings this morning (5:30 am? REALLY??), there was no blood, and with the TEs in place, it really didn't look that bad. Much better than I was expecting. Glad I looked so now I don't have to dread it. Best advice I can give so far is to stretch your chest muscles a bit after you've been sitting or laying because mine have been tightening quite a bit, making me hunch over which causes chest spasms. My PS said to slowly walk my fingers up the wall and that has been helping.   Also, I can't remember who asked if you need help around but YES YES YES!!! My husband has been a Godsend. Last night I couldn't even reach the toilet paper by myself. Sorry for TMI but just trying to help.  Praying for peace for those with upcoming surgeries and for SLEEP for those who've had theirs :-)",

I have a smaller chest right now then I did, but most people are surprised that I don't look like I had a mastectomy. I guess it all comes down to what will make you the most comfortable at your new job. If you feel like people are staring at you(even if they aren't) or that you owe them some sort of explanation, then you could be distracted from your job or feel bad about yourself. That is certainly the last thing you need, right? In my opinion, I guess it never hurts to try them on and see what you think.",

In fact I didn't feel any pain until I moved to get up.  I am planning on sleeping in my own bed tonight! Last night (3rd night after surgery) was the worst for me, but once my sister-in-law (PA, used to work at pain management clinic) told me I could take ibuprofen with my vicodin, it was much better. Today, I have a much much better range of motion and the pain is mostly just an ache (as long as I take my meds) and of coure the compression bra and drains are a big pain in the butt. All in all I am thankful to feel so well today and praying you all will too. Blondelawyer, glad to hear it has not been as bad as you expected. I really felt for you when I read your post-surgery post since I have been diagnosed with IBC (although they feel that that it is not IBC but there is always that possibility) so I also had a lot of skin taken. It is amazing what they can do though isn't it? I'm so grateful for surgical glue and that the days of having stitches removed are over!",

This was because my shoulders had collapsed in and my chest muscles were spasming. I don't know how the others feel about this, but in my case I know when I need to do some exercises and when I can't do anymore.",

The only downside was that they did diagnose it as inflammatory for sure based on the pathology. This is discouraging since it has such a high recurrence rate. But, I am going to continue to focus on the good news and praise the Lord for my healing. Now it is on to the radiologist to discuss what is the next step after the plastic surgeon is done inflating.   In other good news, I got my drains out today and boy does it feel good!

I am 31 and still hoping for more kids, so I am on Lupron injections which suppress ovulation and bring about temporary menopause (good for killing hormone positive cancer anyway). When I go off the injections, my periods should return. Also, my fertility doctor said it is 25%-30% chance of going into menopause on the chemo without the Lupron. Just thought I'd let you know. Also, for everyone buying wigs, this is just my advice. You can choose to take it or ignore it, but I thought maybe I could save you a little money...  I got a free wig from a wig bank and good thing I didn't spend a bunch of money on it since I wore it about 5 times. Not only was it uncomfortable (and maybe a more expensive one wouldn't be) but also I didn't feel like myself when I wore it. I felt much more comfortable in hats and scarves. I never thought I would!  So I guess my advice is to get a cheaper wig and a hat and scarf and play around to see what you are more comfortable with (after you lose your hair- they fit differently then!), then order what you like. I also found that a lot of my friends and relatives would pick up cute hats and scarves for me when they saw them (they enjoyed being able to help), so I didn't have to buy very many. I bought a couple of pre-tied 100% cotton scarves from hatsfoyou.com and headcovers.com. I wore those all the time!  Maybe Blondelawyer, you could add your experience since you have been through it too and everyone's is different? Like I said, this is just what worked for me, but I wish I had known some of this before I went through it.   One other tip that really worked for me- when my hair started coming out, I was DREADING shaving it. But my kids helped do it, and we turned it into a party instead! One lady I know let her kids decorate her head with washable markers. I was not that brave but thought it sounded pretty cool!  I found that the anticipation of cutting it was MUCH WORSE than actually doing it.  Hope this helps a little at a very hard time!

Everyone- I had my BMX on the 15th and had had very little pain for quite awhile. Now suddenly my right (non-cancer) side is feeling pins and needles or sometimes stabbing pain when I bend down or roll over. I am thinking (and hoping) it is due to nerve regeneration.

I can only pray you have a chemo experience like I did- while not pleasant, it was manageable, especially with help from others on the 3rd and 4th days after chemo.... having a plan to follow helped me and hopefully it will help you too... they diagnosed mine as IBC and have thrown the book at it from the start. I'm just trying to remember that no matter how grim the docs are, there are miracles every day! My sister almost died at the age of 7, my niece at 1 year... and they are both doing just fine and so will we be! We have a great and mighty God on our side who loves us more than anything...  I am STILL waiting on the path results of my surgery from the 15th.... GRRR this is frustrating. But I know it will be soon. Patience...",
