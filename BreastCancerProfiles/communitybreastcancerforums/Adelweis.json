      "Content": "Adelweis wrote: hello...i had my diagnostic mammo and ultrasound today. During the exam it was noted that i had dry flaky aerolas and a crack in right nipple. Marked nipple indentation in left nipple. Expressed nipple discharge bilateral but mostly on left. Sticky milky waxy. I had been getting stabbing shooting pains in one focal spot in left breast. Mammogram revealed an unpalpable 1.4 cm nodule in upper quadrant by armpit of left breast that the radiologist thought was a lymph node but ultrasound confirmed it wasnt. The sticky (where i get pain)they put on for mammogram turned out to be dense tissue. The radiologist came in and did her own ultrasound she said it has blood flow and can grow. Its lobular oblong shaped and she could outline it with a pencil. She had the nurse navigator come meet me and she said she would call me with the results of my core biopsy this thursday. Thats all i know for now im going to get a copy of the mammo and ultrasound tomorrow from the hospital before the biopsy (dont know if thats good idea?). Thnx for reading and i wish everyone peace and comfort here. ♡ Log in to post a reply",
