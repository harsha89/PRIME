My surgeon said it was due to the skin no longer being pulled forward by my old breasts. My implants were smaller than my breasts, so there was extra skin that collected there and contributed to the dog ears. I had the revision only 10 days ago and can already see such a significant improvement! The recovery was considerably easier and virtually painless- only soreness. I wish you well my dear!",
