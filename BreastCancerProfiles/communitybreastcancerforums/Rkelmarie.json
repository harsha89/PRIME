Because of the size of my tumor it was recommended to do chemo first for my treatment plan. I started chemo in November and I have three more treatments to go. Next will be my surgery in April. My cancer has responded very well to the chemo and hand exams by my doctor have shown that the tumor has shrunk to almost undetectable by touch alone. I am a candidate for a lumpectomy but the surgeon has made it very clear that due to the location of the tumor and surrounding tissue he would need to take that my breast with most certainly collapse and that radiation could also possibly shrink it and make it even more deformed. I have therefore decided to go with a double mastectomy and reconstruction. I have not felt right about radiaton form the start. However, if I was going to have just the lumpectomy, I was planning on doing it because it's the best choice to make sure all that cancer is killed. Now that I've decided for a double mastectomy, I don't feel the same way. A lot of the studies of the benefits of radiation with a mastectomy are women who are having the surgery first then possibly chemo and then radiation. There is not a lot of data yet for women in my case who are having the chemo first and the chemo is doing the excellent job of shrinking the tumor & killing all the cancer before surgery. I obviously want to make the best choice for my health and non-reoccurrence. However I'm not finding a lot of back up where the benefit outweighs the risk of the radiation. I just can't shake this feeling in my gut that it's unnecessary. Anyone out there feel the same? Or had a masectomy and refused radiation? Happy with the decision or regret? Or if you did have masectomy and radiation - same - happy or regrets Dx 10/1/2018, IDC, Right, 6cm+, 1/1 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
