I had a modified radical bi-lateral mastectomy in Jan of this year - then the chemo and rads... and my surgeon was extremely supportive - I had BC in left breast and we did a prophylactic on the right - they found a benign tumour in it anyway.... I have made the decision not to have a reconstruction at this time, I was a 36F, so am absolutely happy at being boob-free. I have the Amoena prosthesis, and have only just got them a couple of weeks ago, and am extremely happy with them - I can pretty much choose if I want to wear them or not. Although I am pretty much wearing them mainly to work - as soon as I get home in the evening - they are off!!! Exercise is definitely the key in getting the lymph nodes re-distributing - it has made a big difference for me. Hugs Cynthia",

I was the same - although it took a little longer for me as I had a double mast. But here I am 9 months later and through the other side!!! I think you are about 7 hours behind Oz. Love Cyndie",

I found that sucking on ice chips whilst I was having the chemo infusions really helpful in preventing mouth ulcers. They really made a huge difference. That and avoiding I have loved catching up on your posts - they have really made me smile today - I really needed it!!! hugs & kisses from the land down under!!!",
