It was't so bad. But start putting Aquaphor on your breast after 1st treatment. Use it every day! You don't feel like anything is happening yet but the rads are cooking your skin. It just isnt showing yet. Never got real pain but did get a bad rash and now one white breast and one tanned. I'm now on Tamoxifen for 5 years. I'm allergic to Arimidex.",
