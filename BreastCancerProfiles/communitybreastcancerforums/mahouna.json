Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. Abstract Flaxseed (FS) has been shown to attenuate mammary tumorigenesis, possibly due to its high alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)-rich oil (FSO) content. This study determined the effect of FSO on the growth of estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumors (MCF-7) in ovariectomized athymic mice at high premenopausal-like estrogen (E2) levels. Mice with established MCF-7 tumors were fed basal diet (control) or basal diet supplemented with FSO (40 g/kg) for 8 wks. Compared with control, FSO reduced tumor size (33%, p<0.05) and tumor cell proliferation (38%, p<0.05) and increased apoptosis (110%, p<0.001). FSO also reduced human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (79%, p<0.05) and epidermal growth factor receptor (57%, p=0.057) expression, which then may have led to a reduction in Akt (54%, p<0.05) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) to phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK, 28%, p<0.05). Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, MAPK and phosphorylated Akt were not affected. FSO increased (p<0.001) serum ALA, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and, in vitro, ALA reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation (33%, p<0.001). Thus, FSO regressed estrogen receptor-positive human breast tumorigenesis at high E2 levels via downregulation of the growth factor mediated pathway, likely through its ALA content, and may explain the anti-tumorigenicity of FS.

I am convinced that the radiation caused my breast cancer and my awful diet did not help. Here in florida all they want to do is cut off both my breasts without any discussion so i started to read and read and read, I do find Canada actually looks at preventing it not just \"treating it\". Our methods here will someday be looked upon as barbaric. I read all these posts and feel the fear, we are all afraid but we cannot blindly follow. We have to make our own decisions based on educating ourselves because frankly the Docs are too busy to continue learning. Here is what bothered me the most, if they are so good at what they do then why do 1 out of 2 men get cancer and 1 out of 3 women? I would call that a dismal failure, not winning the war on cancer..........",
