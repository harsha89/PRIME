I had this procedure on April 28th and the tightness in my right breast is even worse. I know it's only been 6 wks, but I'm so ready to throw in the towel! Has anyone with these sx thought of doing this or actually had them removed?? If so, is there improvement? It's so frustrating to see such little progress in almost 2 yrs!",

It's like a theraband wrapped tight around my chest all the time. I have not been able to wear a bra since my mastectomy in Oct 09. It is unbearable!! Mentally, it has beat me up pretty good - not only do I have the discomfort, but I have a caved in chest and can't wear prostetics. When I made the decision to have the implants removed, I really didn't think this would bother me because I thought the pain and discomfort would be gone and that was what was most important. Now I still have the pain and dressing is a big challenge. I can only wear camis under my clothes. My concern with the fat grafting is what my PS said - it probably won't help the tightness. I now take Lyrica as well as Cymbalta. I think the Cymbalta has helped me mentally cope a bit better. As for the Lyrica, I've seen no difference in how I feel and I've been on it since early November. I take tramadol for pain which does nothing - unfortunately, percocet is the only thing that takes the edge off.",

Like your sister, I have this terrible tightness for 4 years now and am just so tired of the band aid meds that really don't help anyways. You might share this with your sister. I have decided to have surgery after diagnostic nerve blocks really seemed to help me, especially the most recent which was U/S guided. I am extremely nervous about another surgery but I have talked to two patients of Dr. Williams who have had the surgery. One of these patients said it definitely was a big improvement and the other has no discomfort at all, the iron bra is off!! I found this information on Facebook - Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome. The surgery is a resection of the intercostal brachial nerve and muscle implant. http://www.baltimoreperipheralnervepain.com/ Baltimore is not that far from New York and it may be worth a consult.  Mary Lou ",

From my own personal experience, the last thing I would do is any kind of surgery. More surgery creates more scar tissue and that can make things worse. In addition to this, more surgery can make you at risk for infections. I had a bilateral mastectomy 6 years ago with reconstruction/ deconstruction and I think I've tried just about everything from PT, trials with different meds, acupuncture. I currently take a combination of 450 mg of Lyrica, 60 mg of Cymbalta and OxyContin, 30 x2 per day. I can say that this combo takes the edge off but by no means am pain free. Some days are way better than others. I do try to exercise regularly like the treadmill, Pilates or a low impact toning. I've been battling the scale with the Lyrica! If anything, it helps me mentally. Hoping that you find some relief! Mary Lou Pavone",

Right now, I am enjoying not wearing the \"iron bra.\" I have visited a Iocal prostetic store and they don't fit you until you are totally healed because of swelling, etc that will change. Everybody heals differently but I was told to wait at least 4 weeks. Hope this helps you and continue to ask questions!! The information that I have received from personal experiences on this website has been way more helpful than any of my doctors!",

Noone can tell me this is how we are supposed to feel. The only thing that takes the edge off the discomfort is percocet and I don't want to be taking narcotics the rest of my life to feel better!!",

It has improved but it's been a long bumpy road. I did have a capsulotomy shortly after my exchange and it truly did nothing. It was a waste for me. I deconstructed 6 months later because I just couldn't take it anymore. I had not been able to wear a bra from day one. I developed an infection which I was hospitalized for. This was prior to the exchange. As a matter of fact, my PS chose to move the exchange up in order to salvage the reconstruction. After my deconstruction, my pain continued and I was getting absolutely nowhere with either my PS or BS because I was the only patient that ever experienced PMPS Right!!! How do we ever prove it's surgical error like we know it is??? I now go to U of Penn to the pain clinic there. I've been going there for a year and although I'm not where I want to be, there is definitely an improvement. I now take 300 mg on Lyrica, 30 mg of morphine 3 times per day. I was originally seen by a PS at Penn, Dr. Joseph Serletti, who came highly recommended to me but when I had my consult with him, he didn't want to suggest anything until my pain issue was better. He recommended I see the pain clinic at U of Penn. I got the impression that he really didn't want to touch another surgeon's problem. So that is where I'm at, still going to Phila (2 hrs from me) every 2 months. It's worth it to me because for the very very first time, I've found a dr. who believes me, tells the truth and has said that he sees this all the time!! How can 2 major hospitals less than 100 miles apart have such different stories??? Mary Lou",

My favorite line is the conclusion - All women undergoing breast cancer surgery should be fully informed of the possibility of developing chronic neuropathic pain syndromes. As I've mentioned before, I've been so disappointed in the lack of post cancer care. Neither my BS or PS recommended PT to me. It was through my primary doc that I obtained a referral and in the past 2 yrs, have gone to 3 different physical therapists, one being a lymphedema therapist. I totally agree that surgeons don't get the pain thing. After being reminded by my surgeons how I fall in such a small percentage - the first in 35 yrs for my breast surgeon, I've divorced both and have moved on to a pain clinic. It was doing nothing for me mentally to here their stats. My pain dr. is trying different things and talks with hope. I do upper body stretches (combo of everything from all my PT sessions). It does feel good to do this and totally agree it's a must.  ",

I just started it but it kept me awake the first few nights so I started taking it earlier. My doc now has increased the dosage but I just don't like the way it makes me feel so I'm going to cut it back. The nerve blocks sound a bit scarey though. I just finished PT with a lymphedema therapist (not that I have that) but she was highly recommended. The massage therapy felt great but wasn't seeing any difference in my pain levels. She recommended going the Pain Clinic route and going back to PT later if necessary. I am also having an MRI Monday that my family doc has ordered to see if there is anything else going on. As you can see, my support system has been my GP, not my surgeons. My PS suggested a personal trainer and begin lifting weights!! I do stretching exercises and am pretty faithful. My range of motion is ok but nothing is pain free. Thanks for your info and will keep you posted.",

He used something in the lidocaine family (starts with M, sorry can't remember name). He used ultra sound to guide him to troubled nerves (T3, T4, and T5 areas). What he is doing is a resection of the Intercostal Nerve and will implant nerves into muscle. This is the best I can describe in lay terms. Basically, he is killing the nerves. I honestly can say I'm extremely nervous about another surgery, but on the other hand, I'm so very worn out from chronic pain. On Monday, I will be 4 yrs out from my bmx and this is way too long to feel this way and way too long to be on meds that are really just putting a Band-Aid on things.
