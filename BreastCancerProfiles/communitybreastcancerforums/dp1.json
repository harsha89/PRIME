I really don't think the drains are coming out yet, still filling them up. I tried not to over do it too much when I got home. The surgery went well, most of the pain was from the tissue expanders. Definitely use the pain medication and stay ahead of the pain. I am still sleeping in my recliner. Day one and two were pretty rough, but each day gets a little easier. My pathology came back good, so that is one bright side. Now I just have to keep plugging along and take one day at a time. Good luck to those with future surgeries and any one still recovering.",

Some bruising on left breast (side with cancer, previously radiated, SNB done on this side). The right breast looked pretty good. Unfortunately drains are being kept in till my next appointment with her, next Thursday. I do see the breast surgeon on Tuesday, I'm curious to see what she has to say. The doctor did show me how to lay in a bed & get myself up if I'm alone. Im pretty sick of the recliner at this point! Hope your recovery goes well. Hang in there everyone",

What really freaked me out was Tuesday night around midnight I had the worst gallbladder attack. After 7 hours I finally went to the ER. (Had them before, usually over in 2).i got scared something else was going on. The pain was unbearable! Had ultrasound done, no blockage gave me IV fluids,pain & nausea meds, felt much better. I had talked to my surgeon about removing my gallbladder earlier this year. Doc said they would have to stop chemo if they operate now. I am not stopping chemo and will pray that my gallbladder behaves itself. Just what I need, another problem to worry about. When it rains, it pours! But did I mention that today's treatment went good!! Hope everyone is doing well and plugging along",

I think the unknown makes things extra scary. Hope everyone here is doing well with their treatments so far. Fingers crossed till Thursday. I just turned 57 and got the horrible news right before the holidays. Now that the holidays are over, reality is really sinking in and my journey begins ",
