So I had a pretty big divot, especially on a small A cup. I was pretty deformed looking. I never really got a chance to worry about it, because they didn't get clean margins and a week later, the whole breast came off. I am blessed that my husband was with me 100% of the way, and saw me and helped me through every step (7 surgeries, counting reconstruction). Before this, he was never very compassionate, but this whole experience changed him. Maybe give your husband time. Also, maybe a consultation with a plastic surgeon just to know what your options are. Insurance is supposed to cover reconstruction, if they cover mastectomies. I would think a lumpectomy is the same. Check it out.",

Since my mastectomy and various reconstruction surgeries, I've done a pretty good job of keeping covered up at the gym or the pool. I don't want to be embarrassed by having bc scars, but I don't want to have the reaction you had. Especially with young girls who are just finishing up swim practice when I get there. Has anyone else had this kind of experience, good or bad?",

It didn't show up as anything on a mammo or an ultrasound. But it hurt and it was annoying, so the surgeon finally agreed to take it out. Still sure it wasn't cancer. Well, it was biopsied, found it contained DCIS and lead to a uni mx. It was not invasive so I didn't need chemo or radiation, so everything is fine now. I've tried to press my doctors about whether the mushy lump was the actual cancer or we just happened to find the cancer by taking it out. The only answer is that ANY change to your breast should be brought to their attention. So I'd push for them to take you more seriously.",
