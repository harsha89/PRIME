I am sexually active , without condom and birth control...I know I know but I am not pregnant or sick...but I have always had an irregular period but this time I haven't seen my period since November 5 2014. It is now march 11,2015. Yesterday I found a lump in my left breast. I mean it hurts a bit like a slight heavy feeling but just in that area of the lump and in that one breast. I got really worried because my mothers only sister who grew me up just died June 7 , 2014 from untreated metastatic breast cancer. I wen to a Dr and they referred me to get an ultrasound first and then a mammogram because I am younger than the age expected for mammogram. Now my appointment date is set for April 30 I am beyond scared. What do u think this is .....help please Â  Log in to post a reply",
