      "Content": "Jkv924 wrote: Hi all-- I have been lurking since my mammo came back needing more info--after ultrasound they want a biopsy. I have had tenderness under the arm of the targeted breast for a while, but I am sort of at that age where I am menopausal and everything hurts :) During the ultrasound the tech seemed very interested in my underarm area and I just wondered if that was normal--I'd be interested in others experiences. No mention of the underarm on the US report. From the US: \"hypoechoic mass, with angular margins, and associated shadowing measuring up to 0.4 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. There is an adjacent linear tract.\" Any insight appreciated! Also want to say I find you all inspirational and so brave! Kate Log in to post a reply",
