I am seeing improvement in my tearing and she said as long as it doesnt get worse over time that it probably will be fine and wont need any procedures. They only think they really should give tubes at the beginning of treatment to prevent the scaring but that it is pointless to give the tubes once the watering has started. So now i just wait and see how it goes.  I had the red rawness under my eyes too and started using that Eurocrin (spelling?) it is like vasaline but for any scars, wounds etc. it took care of it right away. I put it on each night before bed around my eyes. It is gentle and non irritating and did the trick! we are not being petty! if i have to tell another person that i am not crying i just may loose my mind!!!",

I am naturally a dark blonde, but the color growing in right now was really mousy. So she felt going dark would really make it look thicker. It did the trick, just coloring the few grays i have aquired made it look so much better. I agree with Judy, once i stopped wearing hats and scarves a couple weeks ago it is growing faster. I notice a difference each week when I style it. i can actually move it aournd with gel, before it just was \"there\", no amount of goop would help. Dont forget that my nurses told me that you cant really count the first 3 weeks after your last chemo in your count. That is time that the chemo is still killing any hair that is trying to grow. So it is not unusual to see actual stubble week 6 to 9. I am 18 weeks post chemo, but my hair growth is more like 15 weeks. CHELEV- your hair looks great! you have bangs! that is what i am trying to be paitent about.

JEN- I took my hat off officially on thanksgiving day. that was 15 weeks after chemo. my pic that is up is from 12/11. It is really growing now. i think taking off the hat helped for some reason. but I have heard that men who wear hats a lot tend to have hair growth issues. so i guess the fresh air helps? who knows, but i dont catch anyone looking at me like they did when i was in a scarf or hat. That is a nice feeling to just blend in with the crowd again! :) Like JUDY it looks like my lashes are coming out again, they fell out a few weeks post treatment and grew back right away. But in the last two days i have notices a few lashes come out :( so I guess it is my turn again! thank god for eyelier! i wore it and nobody could even tell i didnt have lashes! My brows are back to normal now and at full length. Not sure if they will come out again too. they were really fast to grow back, i think i was only without brows for a few weeks.",

Have you gone to a dermotologist to find out what you can do? I know that Rogaine is suppost to help and they make it for women. I am sorry if this is informatino that you already know. It is such a long thread i miss out on some of what has been posted! I know that it must be so frustrating! I was anticipating this amazing thick colorful head of hair to grow back but instead mine is fine, seems pretty straight and the mousiest color of dirt blonde EVER! I am happy it is growing, but i was really hoping for golden bouncy curls or at least my former wavy thick blonde hair. I know that it can take a couple years for it to recover to the way it was before. CHELEV- you are so funny about Florida hair! Bad enough everyone has long big hair but then you have the humidity to contend with!!!  I think we should all demand to pay Men's hair cut prices for our short little dos!!!",

She must have felt bad for calling me that. i never took it wrong, but i was a little embarrased. so i am glad she saw that! Okay, today marks week 7 for me and i am seeing a very faint dark shadow on the top of my head. I think it means that my normal hair (not that clear fuzzy hair) is starting to sprout! Am I right? Any of you ahead of me remember that? I still look bald even though i feel so much stubble on my head. Does it start to fill in soon? I am sick of looking at my white scalp! ha ha I feel like putting tanning cream on it! LOL",

I dont think i will look like you did in two more weeks (at 9 weeks) but i have hope to at least to color my stubble by then and actually SEE my hair! Oh and the link you sent me didnt take me to your 4 week pic  But i appreciate you trying to send me to it. It really helps that we are all here to share with each other. Without this site, i dont know what i would do!  Funny thing- I was wondernig when the hair under my arms was going to grow back (since i am already shaving stubble from my bikini area! leave it to that to grow back the fastest!!!!) and i noticed today that i have about 1/8th of an inch of baby fine chemo hair under my arms! i couldnt even see it before it was so light! so crazy! So i guess i can start shaving that now too, my leg hair is still asleep for now. LISALISA- I love Ellen's hair too! I keep looking at hers, Sharon Stone's and Hally Barry's and just hoping to get to that stage by the end of the year and rock a chic pixie cut! So adorable and looks so easy to style!",

Each day i see more and more new hair poking through. the back is getting really thick, so at least soon i can wear my hats without a scarf underneath. Why is it that the top is the last to fill in? ugh! My new fear is starting Tamoxofin and i hear some people experiance hair thining. I am just barely growing my hair back and wondered who here is on tamoxofin and did they see any significant hair thinnig or slower growth? Also, i know some people are using Roagain products, if you use them and stop, will your hair continue to grow as usual? I know with men if they stop using it they will stop growing hair in the balding regions. I am full of questions today! ha ha",

I am finding that everyones time table is different. Some people grow back right away and other take a few months.",

She and I have been very close and talk several times a day and she lives 5 minuets from me. ONce i was diagnosed she got really distant. Have you talked about your feelings with your sister, if so how did you approach it. I have been reluctant to bring up the subject at this point. It has gotten so tense between us that I am afraid of a blow up. NANCY- i agree, your hair is looking really good! Very chic! I cant wait to have enough to color. It is growing but not fast enough! I am only 6 weeks out, but looking forward to that week 15 that seems to be the magic number! ",

Bold, you were brave to bleach when everyone keeps saying to wait to do it. But i seee your hair did well! CHELEV- you are so right about just ditching the scarf and be free! I think more people look at me in my scarf then would if i just have a short do. Plus in los angeles, people have all kinds of hair styles so i will just fit in with the crown here!
