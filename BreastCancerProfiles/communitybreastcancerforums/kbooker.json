    "Content": "kbooker wrote: Hello - I recently had a recurrence of breast cancer after 4 years. My first diagnosis was in 2006 - on my 39th birthday - imagine that. Luckily, I was intuitive enough to do a self breast exam and discovered the lump myself. Underwent chemo, had mastectomy - radiation and more chemo. I really thought I was done with all this - even had my port removed back in June of 2010. Then in October - experienced shortness of breath that caused me to be hospitalized for nearly a month. During that time - tests were performed that detected a lymph node in my chest and one in my neck. Of course I was DEVASTATED and so was my husband. We have 2 daughters (16 and 7 yrs old). Since then - I had a new port put in - and am undergoing chemo on a weekly basis (3 wks on - 1 week off). I'm receiving Taxol and Avastin. Emotionally - I'm a wreck - I put on a good front for my family and friends. I take Cymbalta - which has been adjusted to help me cope with this. I want to live to see my girls graduate highschool/college, get married...I want to be a grandma some day. I can't believe this is happening to me AGAIN. I'm feel so overwhelmed - and at times hopeless. I've already completed 6 treatments - this is my week off. I'm suffering from Neuropathy - really bad. In need of encouragment - thanks.
