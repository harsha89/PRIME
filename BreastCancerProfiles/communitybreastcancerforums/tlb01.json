I went for my routine mammogram on October 21. They found a cyst and what they said was calcification. On that day I had a fna of the cyst. The next day I returned for a vacuum assisted core biopsy. Pathology came back with intraductal papilloma. The core biopsy removed two complete and one partial. I was referred to a surgeon the following week and on November 4 I had a hook wire localisation and surgery. Two days later I got the all clear. The pain wasn't too bad but I have found some slight swelling under my arm this week which is two weeks out. I am exhausted but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with what my body went through in such a short time. ",
