SO - those of you worried and waiting, I'm feeling a bit more trustful about the 80% vs. 20% benign stats.  And learned a ton along the way, mostly that this is the most amazing and supportive group of people I've ever seen.  I will definitely be back if/when I have other questions or something else comes up (hopefully not) and will check in from time to time, just because ...

So I'm as ready as I'll ever be.  Hopefully I can talk the BS into calling me before the followup appt. Thanks for all your help.  These boards are keeping me sane! Diane Log in to post a reply",
