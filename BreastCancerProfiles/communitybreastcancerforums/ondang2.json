I complain again my nipple discharge on my right breast only on and off, spontaneous and in single duct so she performed a breast exam and  found a mobile nodule 1 cm on my right breast at 11oclock so she order me another mammo and refered me to a general surgeon, this is the result of my mammo   march 2013 mammo result the breast are composed of appoximately 50% fibroglandular densities. The parenchymal pattern is symmetric between both breasts. what does it mean??? no suspicious mass is identified. specifically, no focal abnormality is seen in the upper outer quadrant, as the patient cannot feel the any palpable abnormality, an ultrasound examination was not perform. There are no areas of architectural distortion or suspicious clusther of microcalcification. Impression: there are no specific mammographic signs of malignancy as the patient cannot feel or indicate any palpable abnormality, an ultrasound examination was not performed. management of a palpable abnormality should be based on clinical ground. If this palpable. I already met the general surgeon and he peformed a breast examination to me and he said that he did not see anything wrong on my breast everything is good and normal and he already read my mammo and like what he said there is nothing to concern and it was normal thats all. I ask the nipple discharge he said thats normal it was only a fluid that stock on my nipple. Im not satisfied with my check up and still worried about the result on my mammo what does it means can anyone explain it to me and one of my concern is  felt the lump now what my family dr found during breast exam how come that the general surgeon said that he did not feel anything wrong?  please.....................i need an explanation with my result i want peace on my mind its really hard to ask for second opinion here in canada unless there is a referral  or another concern.  Log in to post a reply",
