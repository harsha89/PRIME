Sent me for the digital mammo and nothing. So, off to the MRI. MRI should 2.3 cm, and that is what my tumor measured after my mast. They did a biopsy a few days later with the mri. Confirmed the IDC. I had a bilateral mastectomy, about 6 weeks to recover, and I have had 4 rounds of A/C chemo and my first taxol yesterday. I'll go on tamoxifen when I am done. PLEASE ask me anything you like. The ladies on these boards are awesome. Remember, your MRI could show nothing. Try not to panic!",

While I would never want to deter a woman's right to be a mother, I don't know that I could honestly make the decision to bring another life into the world with such an uncertain future. It may be amazing for her for the time in which she has to enjoy it, what happens to the child and its well being and emotional health if things don't go her way and her lazy cancer wakes up? It is a tough topic to swallow because so many of us are mothers, and we wonder every day just how much life we have to live with our kids. I think that goes from Statge 0 to Stage 4- we have cancer, we will always have cancer, some of us may be free of it, but whether we like it or not, it never goes away. I can only imagine how this post has affected our Stage IV sisters-  so many of them fight every day with all they have for precious more time with their kids. This idea, no offense to you or your friend, seems really reckless. I was 36 at diagnosis, \"young\" by BC standards. I have a high oncotype and will be looking over my shoulder just waiting for this thing to come back for the rest of my life. I can hardly bear thinking about leaving my 11 year old. I don't think we have had nearly enough time together. I, for one, would never bring a child into the world knowing I had a terminal illness. Just saying. It is not fair to anyone involved. Further, posting on this forum, while not intended to be hurtful and a reminder of what our Stage IV sisters fight for everyday, is totally inappropriate. These are the bravest women you will ever meet in your life. They do not need to be asked questions like this or have their special space invaded unless it is to wish someone well or offer condolences. Period.",

I see my battered body one way- scarred, sore, about 30 lbs lighter, bald, and dryer than the freakin sahara below the waist. Like Apple said, I could never have sex again, and it would be just fine with me. I love the feeling of being intimate and cuddling with my husband, however the idea of sex just does nothing for me. My husband sees that his wife is now skinny, has a great set of reconstructed boobs, and a nicer body (in his opinion) than before cancer, and he can't keep his freaking hands off me. I brought up the scream cream idea. He got offended, like why would I need help to enjoy sex with him? Even the lube conversation hurts his male pride somehow. So at least once a week, I struggle through the pain, bite my lip, fake a little moan and groan, and count the seconds until it ends. It is starting to make me resent him, and that is the last thing I want to do, because he's been nothing short of amazing through all of my surgeries and treatment. I don't know what to do.........but I am so glad to have ladies who understand!",

      "Content": "misswim wrote: Hi Ladies: First let me say that I think you are the bravest group of ladies I have never officially met. I have hesitated posting in this forum but am hoping to get some advice. I was diagnosed in April of this year. At the time, I was working out twice a day, feeling great, lost 30 pounds, best shape of my life. Found my lump after losing weight (literally saved my life as it was under the nipple and hard to feel even after I discovered it- both surgeons were stunned I found it on my own.) Had a BMX with immeadite implant reconstruction, and went from a DD to a B. Ended up with diffuse muscle pain on the right (cancer) side after surgery, Had surgery for my port in which the positioning on the table pinched a nerve in my back and I was in the worst pain of my life. Ended up in the ER. Onc had a full series of spinal x-rays done at that time. Showed nothing abnormal in the spinal column , neck, or ribs. Onc felt no follow up scans were necessary. I have justed completed 4 rounds od A/C, to start Taxol next week. I was diagnosed at Stage 2A, no nodal involvement, angiolymphatic invasion was highly focal, but Oncotype was 33, which is high.  No scans at diagnosis, other than breast MRI and chest x-ray, and then the full set of x-rays before chemo started on my back. No bone scan, CT or PET. Onc said \"not indicated in early stage bc\". I am being treated at an affiliate of a major cancer center and have felt thus far that my care has been good. My back pain has gotten so much worse and now feels like it is in my spine. I attributed it to the Neulasta shots I received but it has not gone away. I finally broke down yesterday and told the oncologists NP how severe the pain had become. It is in the middle of my spine, with pain that radiates to my right shoulder and now ribs. It is not like any pain I have ever felt. I am 37 years old and have never had back pain in my life so this is very scary for me. My husband's mother died at 31 from MBC and so the fear of mets is with me all the time. The onc has pushed off my complaints, that \"mets are highly unlikely\". They keep telling me my anxiety is making it worse. I finally demanded a work up. Prove to me that my pain is coming from something else, and I will deal with it. Until then, my pain, and fear, are very very real. I am scheduled for a bone scan next week. If it is negative, I will have an MRI. Can anyone give me advice as to symproms of bone mets, what the pain feels like, is it something that gets progressively worse? I am able to sleep with the right amount of ativan and the oxycodone prescribed, it does not get worse at night. It is excrutiating during the day. Thank you for any advice you can give me. I appreciate it so much. Dx 4/15/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 7/8/2011 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",

When I went into my treatment, DD a/c and DD Taxol, I was borderline anemic, always have been, hemoglobin was around 11 at start, but it has always been that way. I am one who has had perfect blood work my whole life, in fact even during chemo, the nurses always remark at my chem panel being so great, low , perfect liver enzymes that have not moved, always on the low end of normal for everything. But, hemoglobin has dropped after every treatment. Went in for my weekly bloodwork after first taxol- happy to hear my wbc is holding its own (no Nuelasta thank god- that stuff is evil and caused bone pain that resulted in a bone scan and MRI to rule out mets the bone pain was so severe), however, hemoglobin is the lowest yet- 8.5. They asked me to come back Friday to re-run CBC. Again, wbc's good, but in two days, my hbg went to 8.2. Dropped .3 in less than 48 hours. I have been feeling better than on a/c with the first taxol, but so tired. Makes alot of sense now. This week, ringing in the ears, numbness in the tounge, lightheadedness....... the onc said - classic anemia symptoms. Went to the farmer's market for a half hour today and haven't been able to get off the couch since. I have basically been told to report to the oncology department to have my cbc done AGAIN on Monday morning, and plan on being there for a transfusion. 7.5-8.0 is transfusion world at my center, and unless my hbg has recovered miraculously over the weekend, I'm stuck.  My question is- has anyone had to have a blood transfusion due to anemia during chemo? Are there alternatives? If so, does the transfusion help with energy levels? It is a scary procedure? Thanks, as always, for any advice. I'm a little freaked by the idea of a blood transfusion, but I have treatment Weds, and I don't want anything to hold it up.

Went from a DDD to a B overnight. Since surgery, I have had muscle pain in my mid back, shoulder and arm after use. I had 4 rounds of A/C with Nuelasta which exacerbated my pain. I pretty much begged for a bone scan and CT becuase I was sure the pain was mets..... it isn't, both were clear as a bell. I went to see the breast surgeon today and she noticed , as I do, that my \"bad\" side has alot more scar tissue forming around the implant and is very tight. I saw a PT right after surgey but once chemo started that all flew out the window. The surgeon thinks I am well on my to adhesive capulitis (frozen shoulder ) and felt I was suffering from a little chostocondritis as my ribs get tender at times after working at my desk all day under the implant. I guess my question is, has anyone experienced PMPS and if so are the pains in the shoulder, mid back normal? I go to an NCI cancer center, and love my surgical oncologist and she feels that PT is imperative. She also thinks chemo exacerbates the pain and that because I am right side dominant, my tumor was on the right, and so much more surgery was performed on that side, as the left was propholactic, it is natural that the two sides are healing differently and that revision surgery after several sessions of PT should help incredibly. Any experiences to share? Many thanks! Dx 4/15/2011, IDC, 2cm, Stage IIA, Grade 3, 0/6 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 7/8/2011 AC + T (Taxol) Log in to post a reply",
