    "Content": "KristenHI wrote: Good morning from Hawaii...I am a 47 yr old woman. I had uterine cancer in my late 20's and had a partial hysterectomy. I am unaware of breast cancer running in my family. About two weeks ago I noticed an indention in my L breast. I can place a finger in it. Of course I have googled and probably scared myself silly with misinformation. I am waiting on my insurance to kick in to schedule a mammogram, but I wanted to reach out and get some real and accurate input and insight. Thanks in advance for any and all advise. Have a wonderful day! Kristen Log in to post a reply",
