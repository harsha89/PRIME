I feel like a stranger in this new world of breast health and am so happy to have found this site where there is so much support and wisdom. I'm dreading the MRI procedure itself but definitely looking forward to more information afterwards. I'm glad to know that your MRI picked up extra information but am so sorry that it was DCIS. Also, thanks for explaining more about the Birads scores. I've seen lots of people refer to them in their posts but didn't know what it actually was.",

      "Content": "Mins_Mum wrote: Hi everyone. I could definitely use some reassurance or lessons learned. I have lots of questions... My surgeon is recommending a 3-month recheck for what seems likely to be papilloma and I'm wondering if that's standard? Two weeks ago I noticed a bloody discharge in my bra one night. Gyn scheduled me right away when I called the next day. They sent a culture out to the lab and those results are indicative of a papilloma. The GYN referred me for mammo and US which showed no masses and could not detect the likely source of the bleeding, which was still occurring during the mammo. I'm 52, so I have been getting regular mammograms for years and there is no substantial change from the past. My breasts are also very dense (50-75%), so it seems that is not helping with diagnosis. The bleeding stopped after 3 days. I saw the BS this week at the 14 day mark. During the exam and consultation she seemed to think it was likely cystic issue. She recommended a three month follow up, and moving to mammo and us every 6 months. She indicated I could pursue MRI but that it would probably also show nothing. I pushed for MRI which has been approved by insurance and is scheduled for the end of this week. After our consultation BS called back late day to say she had just seen the lab report of the culture and hadn't seen it earlier when we had our consult. She definitely wants me to do MRI now, but reiterated that she didn't expect it to show anything. She said we'd talk about next steps afterwards. My questions are... Did anyone have an MRI that showed something the us did not? Does anyone have experience with a situation where there's likely a papilloma but it doesn't show on imaging? Is it standard to take a wait and see approach with this type of situation? I really appreciate any informed input anyone has as I try to make sense of all of this! Log in to post a reply",
