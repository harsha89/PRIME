Around March 2016 or April 2016, the doctor who read/did my mom's MRI told my family (Family in Hawaii and I'm in Colorado) that my mom (60) has 6 months to live because she has metastatic cancer. My daughters and I flew to Hawaii to see her and my family. The Doctor's prognosis was no where to be found in my mother's medical files. My question is, how do I go about asking the doctor to give us a written note regarding his prognosis-that she has 6 months to live? I have tried to call the hospital and the customer representative had him paged and give me a call but i got nothing.",

She had 10 sessions of radiation and she refuse to do chemo. She is going organic al the way and changed her lifestyle completely. Her lumps have disappeared according to the doctor on her last appointment (july2016). Her oncologist does not say anything about her living for only 6 months. I am trying to help her with her finances from afar and I thought the prognosis would help in many ways. Thank you for your reply. I hope you are doing okay.",
