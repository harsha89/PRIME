I will, at least, need radiation and I don't know what else.  I asked for a double masectomy but they thought that would be pretty ridiculous. Have you ever checked out:  https://www2.mdanderson.org/sapp/contact/selfreferral/index.cfm (#1 in the USA). I can't imagine having to wait so long!  The wait is harder than anything else!  I am 54 and cancer runs in my family, too. My mom had bladder cancer, my dad had prostrate cancer and my younger sister had breast and skin cancer.  They are ALL still very alive and heathy although my parents are almost 90.  My sister had her breast cancer 16 years ago.  I did also have a sister with a spinal tumor but she died 33 years ago (the  dinosaur age when dealing with cancer). So, don't give up :o) . . . but actually I know how you feel; I have 4 kids (one still at home) and 2 grandkids that need me.   ltuenge",
