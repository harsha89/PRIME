She was getting ready for school, and at 6:15am I told her to get in the car to go to school. At 6:45 and almost to her school she said \u201cfunny..we're normally just leaving for school\" and I almost came to a complete stop in the road. My brain was so preoccupied starting rads today, I had her in the car 30 mins earlier than I needed to. I said \u201cwhy didn't you say something before we left?!\" And she said \u201cdad and i talked last night and we said we were just going to make things as easy as possible for you, we'll let you be right about everything for the next 6 weeks\". I laughed and cried so hard! We drove through chik-fil-a since we had extra time. LATER this morning....I had my first real radiation and it went so fast and easy after such a funny, sweet (early) morning.",

My RO didn't hesitate, she said they just figure out how to hit the spots around the implant, but it will cause capsule constriction. Misha13- I had cording! My hospital has a lymphadema specialist and she was incredible! She said my cording was \"wicked\"...ha! I felt like new after 3 sessions with her! I even popped one cord on my own doing one of her stretches at home....felt like breaking a glow stick, except my arm was the glow stick! I hope you have a lymphadema specialist near you!!!!

My doctor found the lump during a routine physical on November 7, I was in for 3D mammogram and ultrasound the very next day, biopsy and diagnosis from that biopsy the next week. Met with the surgeon and had a 3T MRI (night before Thanksgiving) the week after and had my lumpectomy/lymph node mapping and biopsy on November 30. Things moved FAST! The tumor was under a centimeter, clean margins, 10 lymph nodes removed (my surgeon was shocked the lab teased out what he thought were 4 nodes ended up being 10) and all clear! I've had some cording, PT has been amazing for that. I never even took the prescription pain meds after surgery. I was driving 2 days after and shopping with my teenage daughter. I am PRAYING radiation goes as smoothly as the rest of this has been. I had breast augmentation surgery several years ago, I've been told my implant will be all wonky after this, but to have had it removed during the lumpectomy, I would have had to have a tissue expander in whether I choose new implants or a lift. I was told if I had the implant totally removed, my breast would go from \"a grape to a raisin\" during radiation.....YIKES.....when these 6 weeks are over and I've had a chance to heal, I will remove the implants and have a lift. At least for now, I've already got a \"place holder\" and hopefully, I'll have something to work with. I've taken stock in Miaderm, any other ideas? OH! and in the midst of radiation this month, we will be listing our house as my husband's job is relocating us back to my home state....its exciting and happy, but WOO....it will be a lot in the next 6 weeks. I am looking forward to comparing notes throughout these next 6 weeks and getting ides on how to stay energized and comfortable. I did buy a few super soft bras at Soma.",

SNAP that Bubbalicious Gum and TEXT girlfriend...as loud as you want......HAHAHAHA Suzyshackle- I too have a good friend that is a dietitian, and she has given me all the same advise as CHB87 typed. I will add that \"most\" insurance plans cover at 100% anywhere from 3 to 26 visits to see a registered dietitian, it is considered \"preventive care\", and given now you have diagnosis, that may grant you even more covered visits. Check your plan and see if there is a dietitian close! Its nice to have a tailor made plan or creative snack and meal ideas based on feeling well (and what you like to eat). Sometimes the dietitian will even grocery shop with you! ",

Congratulations to you all, keep posting the good news (and post not so good news- so grateful to be learning from you!) I can't wait to post one of those! I thought my first day would be yesterday, but instead it was another simulation type appointment. I was under the machine and they made sure the beams would hit where they are supposed to and I got even more tattoos. About a 45 min appointment. My arms started to get all tingly having to sit still for that long again. Thank Goodness the actual appointments will only be 15 mins! Thinking back, I'm sure my RO told me about this additional \"sim\". She said after the CT sim, her plan is reviewed by several other doctors and everyone agrees and then I start. SO, my REAL first radiation treatment will begin on Monday, I got a calendar print out and everything...ready to roll! I asked for earliest possible time, I drop off my daughter at her school at 7am, might as well get it knocked out on the way home, right?
