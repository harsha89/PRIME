I am on almost the same meds as her except for Tamoxifen, I take Falsodex.  I was diagnosed with primary breast cancer 8 years ago when I was 37, bone mets appeared this Spring.  It was discoved via PET scan because I had lots of lymph node activity on the opposite breast side.  With some ups and down I am doing well now and perhaps could be of some comfort to her.  Feel free to PM me if you are so inclined.",
