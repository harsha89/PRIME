I had no recon and that could be why my experience is a bit different but I was able to shower 24 hours later! My only instruction was to face away from the shower. Janice as far as showering with the drains my doctor gave me a lanyard (one of those things you wear a nametag from and I hooked the drains on that and they hung from there and I showered. As nice as taking a shower was, with the tiredness that everyone describes I really would lay in bed and look at the door to the bathroom thinking how nice it would be to have the engery to shower! Glad everyone is coming along and healing! Maryellen",
