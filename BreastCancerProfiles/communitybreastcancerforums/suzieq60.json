My biopsy came back positive - low grade ductal, so it's definitely worth getting it checked out. Remember my MRI report said probably benign - well no it wasn't. Apparently there are 3 spots in there. They could only get at one to test it. Surgery scheduled for 30th Nov. I'm hoping the surgeon can do it by lumpectomy, I'm terrified of having a mastectomy. They do want the other tiny spots removed as well, seeing the first one was bad. They've marked them with clips using MRI. They can't see them on mammo or ultrasound. They are so thorough, it might be a difficult process but I'm glad they have taken such care (I've had 4 trips to this breast clinic in the past few weeks). It looks like this cancerous spot was there last year and was missed on my mammo as it didn't show on 2 different views - apparently low grade cancer does not respond to chemo. I just wish I'd had an MRI back then and I wouldn't be going through this now. I'm seeing my onc today (my 2nd last herceptin tx) and we'll see what he has to say. Don't be nervous, as I've said before it's better to be safe than sorry. Be glad they are taking such good care of you. Sue",

They have a separate waiting area where I go too. They only have 2 treatment rooms - jacaranda and poinciana - with lovely huge pictures of those trees on the walls. There is a very small waiting area to sit after you change and I only ever had to sit there for a few minutes. The one thing I hate, is that give you a gown to use for your whole time and it's kept in a blue bag - you take it home with you. I hate the blue bag - this time, I'm going to use a bag of my own - a pretty one. Sue",

Luckily that's not where I go for treatments so it will be the last time I have to pay for the parking. Hope the other planning sessions went well. Sue",

Just the VitE and Aloe Vera gel were fine. The skin breakdown wasn't avoidable owing to the large floppy boobs - it also happens with men in the groin area when they have rads for prostate cancer. It happens where there are folds of skin. Maybe this time, if I keep the area dry using a sanitary pad it will be better. It wasn't until really late in the process and I made them dress it for me every day. Once the rads were finished I used Medi Honey on it and it healed up in a matter of a few days. One other important thing - don't use any paper tape or any kind of tape in the rad area. They didn't tell me that and I had taped a panty liner under the boob - ouch - lots of skin came off with it when I removed it. Sue",

Chemo is to hopefully prevent distant recurrence: Is radiation therapy necessary if the margins of the removed tissue are negative? Many studies have reviewed this approach for patients with invasive cancers. Nearly all show that the risk of relapse in the breast is much higher when radiation is not used (20 percent to 40 percent) than when it is (5 percent to 10 percent). Having breast cancer reappear in this way is a very traumatic event psychologically. Also, patients may need to have a mastectomy to be cured in this situation, so in more cases they may lose the breast than if they had undergone radiation therapy initially. Finally, not everyone who has a recurrence in the breast can be cured. Therefore, radiation therapy after lumpectomy is the standard treatment around the world. There are several recent studies in which older patients with small, favorable invasive cancers have had a low risk of local relapse when treated with lumpectomy and hormonal therapy without radiation therapy. There is still uncertainty about the long-term results with this approach or about which individuals will do best without radiation therapy. This issue should be discussed in detail with your doctor. For patients with noninvasive cancer (known as \"ductal carcinoma in situ\") matters are more complicated. Lumpectomy without radiation works well for many patients. However, there is disagreement on who can be treated safely with just a lumpectomy. This should be discussed in detail with your doctor.",

It also says it has some oils in it, but I guess they are in such small quantities it's ok. If the rad onc thinks it's good - I'll believe her. The instructions on the back are for applying to cows udders - A joke I think, although it's probably based on a real udder cream. Beacher - When I had rads last year, there were lots of public holidays at the time, so I didn't always do 5 days a week. However, better to get it over with I think. Good to hear you are using something. Strange you are stinging already though. It is worth getting the aloe gel - I always put that on right after the treatment, sometimes again an hour later. I use the cream several times a day after that. Well, No 10 today - not till nearly 11am, so I can laze around doing nothing until then :) Sue",

Then I use my Moo Goo several times as the day goes by. Last time I used VitE and the Aloe and followed the same process and my skin was really good except for under the breast in the crease - that wasn't my fault as that can happen if you have large floppy boobs. I'm glad your planning session went well. Well, 9 down - 21 to go. They made me wait today and I was really p'd off. Some woman arrived after I did and got taken in first. I complained to the guys and told them they talk too much and run behind. It was tongue in cheek though - they are really nice and I was just stirring them up. Sue",

You can do everything right and will still get it. It's caused because of the fold of skin. Apparently men get it in the fold of skin at the top of the leg when doing rads for prostate cancer. The nurse told me to wear a sanitary pad in the crease. When this happened to me, the nurse would dress it everyday with Solosite and I had to keep a dressing stuck under there. I bought some singlets to hold my boobs in place with the dressing in there - no tape can be used. This happened in my last week of rads and as soon as rads were over, I used MediHoney on it and it cleared up in a matter of days. See what the nurse says - they'll help you sort it out. Sue",

He mentioned there's a curry lunch on offer today, so I'm going in to join in and visit everyone. I have to really start thinking about returning to work. I'm probably going to have another couple of weeks off after rads and then go back part time. My work is really good and I even have a rehab girl who looks after me. Last regular zap today!!! Sue",

I've just spent 20 bucks on the pawpaw, like I'm going out to buy yet another thing. Can't find the solosite from last time unfortunately. Only 4 boosts to go after today. I'm seeing the rad onc today and will finally make her earn her money and get a couple of doctor's certificates for work. I can't be bothered undressing to show her the breakdown. Last time I insisted on taking everything off so she could look, but it's the same as last time so what's the point. I must say the pawpaw ointment is nice and I'm not in any pain. Got the same guy yesterday (the one who did the planning). I told him he shouldn't have wished he didn't have to do my boosts, cos now I seem to be getting him every day. They had a machine  breakdown yesterday and I was there for over an hour. It just came back on line as they did my boost in the other treatment room. Hope you are all ok and not burning up too much.

This is what I was told to do by the radiation oncologist and I did not burn at all - no blisters just slight darkening of the skin. I was given a sheet showing the brands of stuff to use - you must avoid anything with alcohol/oils in them and don't apply anything before you go on the day.

If you had a mastectomy and the cancer was close to the chest wall they will recommend radiation. Lumpectomy + rads = mastectomy. The size, grade, hormone receptor status, HER2 status and lymph node involvement determine whether you will benefit from chemo. I was grade 3 HER2+ve, clear lymph nodes and small 11mm tumour and I had to have chemo owing to the HER2 status. If I had not been HER2 - radiation and hormone therapy was the treatment protocol. I've just had another tumour removed from my other breast and had another lumpectomy. This time it was not HER2, so I'm having rads only. You don't say what your lymph node involvement, size, grade and HER2 status are, so it's hard for us to help you. Sue",

Apparently my rad onc likes Moo Goo Udder cream to use during rads. Wish she'd told me that when I saw her in December. I googled it and there are stockists nearby. On their Australian website, there is a testimonial from a woman who had rads and she tells of how amazed the staff were at how her skin looked at the end of the treatment.   Here's what she said: \"The nurse would check my boob every week and commented on how good it looked (no redness or blisters). I remarked on how I was using MooGoo. They told me to keep using it and were that over whelmed, out came the camera and every week they would take photos of my boob. I had also told my oncologist who was also very impressed. By the end of my 6 weeks (30 zaps) of Radiation my Boob looked like it was into the second week of treatment (just starting to get pink). The staff there were so impressed that they are using me as a guinea pig to put there case forward to use MooGoo all the time. Even the Oncologist said that they would have to look into it.\" I'll go and get some and use it - sounds really good. Also not very expensive. It was so funny today, the tech came to get me and was calling my name looking around the room and she didn't recognise me. I do remember her from last time. Walked past the nurse and she looked up and also didn't recognise me even though she had dressed my boob most days for a week last time. It's amazing what hair can do :) Sue",

I have extensive classic LCIS in my left breast, left after my lumpectomy last year. I freaked out when I read the pathology report but my onc assured me it is not cancer. A new surgeon agreed with him. A recent MRI shows nothing in that breast. LCIS wouldn't usually show up on an MRI. You need to find out if it is pleomorphic LCIS - that does usually require some sort of treatment. If your MRI now shows any suspicious spots, you need to have them investigated. I had 3 spots in my right breast. Only one of those was cancer, but they removed the other 2 just in case. They turned out to be ADH. I do hope you can get some answers from someone. Jo's suggestion of going somewhere totally different is a good one. Hey, at least they stopped you from having more radiation unnecessarily :) (((((( HUGS)))))) Sue",

One of my chemo buddies last year had 1 1/2 hours each way!!! You can use stuff called Crystal Stick deodorant - you wet it and then rub in your armpit - it has no aluminium in it. And as I said, you won't need to shave, the radiation seems to stop the hair growing. So just shave before you start and you'll be hair free for ages. Mine still hasn't grown back under the other arm. Once you all start, you will be amazed at how quick it is and it doesn't hurt at all. It was just the going every single day that got me down but I did have a few public holidays thrown in. Don't be frightened - it's quite easy. I do remember crying when I started, not out of fear but overwhelmed with having surgery, chemo and then having to start another treatment process. I was ok after that though. I can't wait to see the radiographers again - one was really nice and kept pushing me to read the Girl with the Draogn Tattoo and the other 2 books. I did buy them and loved them, so then I was recommending books he could read. They were SO nice - it does help you when they are nice to you. Sue",

Once we reach $1126 out of pocket in out-of-hospital expenses, the government give 80% of the out of pocket as well.

Skin still not showing much colour change - might be a tiny bit pinker than the other side but it's not noticeable. I wish we had taken pics of the other boob last time and we could compare how the skin is holding up. I could have been my own clinical trial of the Moo Goo. I'm sure my nipple was black and sore at this stage last time. The techs do keep an eye on your skin and if there is a problem, they let the rad onc know or send you to see the nurse. When my skin started to breakdown last time - I had to see the nurse and she dressed it for me every day. At the time I couldn't believe it - they made me go and buy my own burn gel to bring with me after she opened a new one to dress it the first time. You would think they would have just given it to me. I hope you are all enjoying your zap free weekend!!! Sue",

I really think it's unavoidable given the size of my girls. It's been extremely hot and humid here so I'm sure that's contributed to it. I did keep a pad in my bra but have been running around in a sarong and knickers for ages due to the extreme heat. Did sitck a small towel under there from time to time but not all the time. I'm not upset like last time though cos I know it will heal up quickly after rads. I burrowed in my medicine drawer and can't find the solosite - must have used it all up. They'll have to dress it for me today and I can get some on the way home. I still have 2 big dressings though and my medi honey for later. POOP!!!!!!

As someone who had 3 suspicious spots show up on MRI - I can relate. They couldn't get at 2 of them (the other one was biopsied using ultrasound and was cancer) and they aren't experts at MRI biopsies, so they used MRI to mark them with titanium clips. The surgeon removed them and they turned out to be ADH - not cancer. What category did the MRI report give to this new spot? Mine were Category 3 - probably benign and that's what they turned out to be. Good to hear from you, Sue",

The curls have been driving me crazy. I noticed the roots were coming in a bit straighter and thought if we trimmed half an inch off it might improve the fuzz. She has also trimmed the sides to give it a better shape. When she dried it, she straightened it out, so it will be interesting to see how it looks today after I wash it. I had wavy hair before but chemo curls are totally crazy!! Also, got my new tyre - hooray - now I can relax while driving. The guys at the tyre place only charged me for the tyre and not fitting it. They suggested putting my spare on the back as well seeing it had never been used and they blacked it for me. We went out for dinner for DH's birthday which was really yummy - nice to have a  night off cooking. ",

I had a biopsy last October - turned out to be nothing. Had a follow up Ultrasound 6 months later and it was OK. You are right they can't radiate the breast twice. I've had both done, so if anything new pops up a mastectomy is the only treatment. I'm booked in for my screening next Thursday. I called knowing they usually are very booked up and thought I would have to wait weeks - well - oh we've had a cancellation next Thursday - so that's when I'm going. How are the peeps?

No hunger pains either so I eat what I like when it's meal time. I have a constant tension headache near my ears - not very strong but annoying and a sore throat the whole time. I've had really bad stomach aches/wind pain and really bad burping and generally feel really off.  Sleeping is the only thing that helps. It's been 10 days now, when will it end? At least the leg pains only lasted over last weekend but the time since that has been a blurr.  Anyone got a suggestion of what to apply to the bottom end to relieve the soreness?

You forget about it after a while. I'm not sure I'll do that when I'm completely bald.  The hairdressers thought that I have a nice head shape and my husband's face lit up in a big smile when he saw it and kept smiling at me all night.  Littlebird75 Your DH might react like mine and actually think it looks great.

Also about your computer, consider investing in Acronis True Image for your new pc. It takes a complete image of your hard drive. I use an external drive to back it up every week or so. I have had to restore many many times and it saves installing windows and other software everytime. It was really inexpensive and works like a charm.",

Can't say I'm over the moon owing to the next week or so of SE's but as the nurse unhooked the taxtotere I said hooray that's over - did the same when she unhooked the carboplatin. I was putting on the emla cream this morning thinking it's the last time I'll use it but chemo brain suddenly realised I have the rest of the year to go with the herceptin. What a dolt. I hope all of you ladies who are still having chemo make it through ok. I'll keep a watch on this thread anyway. I feel like I know you all even though we are on opposite sides of the world. Thankyou for your support and friendship. I started an April Rads thread the other day even though it's a bit early. Hope to see some of you there. Sue",

I still have rads to go yet and that will probably be sorted out when I have my last treatment in 3 weeks. For those postmeno girls like me, Arimidex will be the drug. Not happy about it's bone density side effects though. I've started taking Calcium & Vit D3 supplements Thanks girls for the tip on sleeping. I did manage 6 or so hours so that's not too bad, I can sleep today I hope. Congratulations on finishing chemo Doronet!!! Sue",

I ordered some Nioxin scalp treatment and hopefully it will arrive soon. It's worth trying. Brenda - hope you're not too worn out from all the rads travel, you'll need a big rest after that.

Well, it was until last night. I'd taped a panty liner in the crease underneath over the raw spot and when I took off the tape, I tore some skin off!!! What a bloody idiot!!!! It's only a small patch but it just shows you how sensitive the skin must be and it hurts like hell. Looks like I'll have to buy some pads and stick one under there and wear a bra to hold it in. I was avoiding buying any pads as I thought I'd seen the back of them years ago. They had told me to do that but I've been trying to go braless while I'm home and didn't bother. I didn't have a cast for rads either - sounds really weird. I can see the point as they wouldn't have to go to any trouble lining you up each time. Only 6 of those nasty zaps to go - hurray!!!!

I'm going to see the female bs I'm swtiching over to on Tuesday. She did mention I might like to even them up after rads if the rads shrunk it at all. My bras fit so I don't think it's shrunk too much. I wish the scar wasn't so ugly but I guess they can't do anything about it. The mammo sounds painful. Good luck with the results. Sue",

They can be an indicator you have cancer but they also may not show you have cancer when you do. My DH's markers never showed he had cancer both times. Melinda: The rad onc doesn't do much in my opinion. They work out the dose. Mine didn't even have any input when they measured me up. My weekly visits with her were just little chats where she asked how I was going. She didn't even want me to undress to show her the skin until I got the raw area and I stripped off to show her. It's almost healed by the way. I reckon I can go without the dressing today. My back is getting better again after a relapse over the weekend and 2 physio visits and lots of heat on it.

It was in the crease under the breast like yours and happened at exactly the same time. I stopped putting the aloe and moisturiser on that area and they dressed it with Solosite gel and a non stick dressing every day after my tx. I bathed it with cool boiled salty water after my shower each day and patted it dry. After the boosts were finished I used Medi Honey and it healed really quickly. I think you can get it over there if you buy it online. I kept the non stick dressing under the breast while all this was going on. The gel helped it stay there. Don't try and tape anything there - I lost some skin after doing that. Well, the rehab girl called back and I'm going back to work on 5th July. She recommended 3 half days per week for a month to start with - I can live with that :) I had to get a note from the GP saying I could work the 3 half days. The GP said the tinnitus in my ear was caused by fluid behind the ear drum - shit!!! He said it should clear up in a month or so. Meanwhile I have to listen to crickets all day and night. I hope it does clear up cos it's driving me crazy. Had the thyroid ultrasound and the girl said I have nodules on both sides. I'll get the results of that and the blood test on Tuesday week when I go back to see the surgeon. Then I'll find out if I need any treatment. I chickened out on the gym as I'm still not well from the head/chest cold I have. We are both really sick with it. Thanks to our DD who gave it to us (not). Have a lovely weekend everyone!!! Sue",

More hugs from Oz ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((HUGS))))))))))))))))))))))))) The bs said that lots of women over the age of 50 have goitres. My mother had one back when I was 10 an another recently at age 82. It could be cancerous but she didn't push me to have a biopsy. These days they remove the whole thyroid gland which is rather delicate surgery. I just want to get the herceptin over with, then wait and see on the thyroid. As long as it's not causing swallowing or breathing problems she said we can leave it alone for now. Something nice happened when I went to see the bs the other day. I went in and sat down and this man gave me a big smile and said \"Your hair is such a lovely colour\". He was there with his wife who was about to have her last chemo for bc. She was wearing a hat to cover her bald head. It turned out they live right around the corner from me and I used to be friends with their neighbour about 25 years ago. They have just moved to another suburb, but what a pity we didn't know each other - she and I could have been having coffee and keeping each other company throughout the whole thing. It really made my day, it's not often a man is so complimentary. Seeing me gave them hope her hair would grow back too. This guy at work (who no one likes) had a go at me on Monday about my hair line at the back of my neck being scrappy - what a prick!!!! It really bothered me, so on Tuesday I went and had my first 'hair cut'. The girls in the salon were pleased to see how it's coming back and one of them trimmed the back and again didn't charge me. Some people in this world are nice. Sue",

I'm getting sick of going to the Xray centre - had to go yesterday for an OPG of my jaw. I took the Dear Dentist letter from the onc to the dentist on Monday. They recommend a dental checkup before getting the Zometa infusions because Zometa can sometimes (rarely) cause healing problems if you have an extraction. A year or so ago I had some sort of cyst up in the gum so he thought he should check if it's still there. Also have an old filling that needs replacing. Have to go back there again next week for an echo too. Lucky the place is close to home. I'm doing 4 mornings at work this week. It felt strange getting up early 2 days in a row. I'm starting to think I'm over working. Pity we need the income. Once I get some real work to sink my teeth into, I'll probably be happier. Day off today but it's raining and has been all night.

I did some reading about MRI results and reports. The category they gave both things was category 3 - probably benign. Apparently less than 2% with this category would be found to not be benign. I think it said further followup in few months was recommended with this category. I'm not going to freak out anymore, just wait and see what the surgeon says on Tuesday. I am still concentrating on the fact that if it did turn out to be something, then it's great it's showed up. I would hate to have something in there growing and not know about it.

We can even see where they have circled it on last year's film - not sure who did that. He's furious - if it was noticed last time and they haven't reported it - he's out for blood. My thoughts are, if it looks similar and hasn't changed, it's probably not cancer. If it was cancer, the chemo would have nuked it if it was already there. So, I'm extremely optimistic - just wish DH would calm down. He's so sensitive to all of this shit as he's been through it all himself twice, so I don't exactly blame him. Have a lovely weekend girls and lets try and forget all this cancer crap for a little while. Sue",

They can't biopsy Bonnie's little sisters as it's too hard. They think these 2 tiny spots should be removed when they remove Bonnie even though they think they are benign. If Bonnie hadn't turned out to be cancer they wouldn't have worried about them. The 2 babies are close together. Bonnie is a bit further away, so we're not sure if the bs could get them in one go. They are trying really hard to avoid a mastectomy which was the purpose of today's ordeal - to mark them so they can do wire localisation on the day of surgery. Surgery might be delayed a further week as it might be better for me to have it at the hospital where the breast clinic is. They feel they are the only ones qualified to do the wire insertion as the tiny spots are in a really tricky location and they're the experts. Of course DH is keen to get it done sooner but I'd rather have it done at the bigger better hospital. We'll see what the surgeon says next Thursday and big onc on Wedesday.  The saga continues - I feel like I've got a whole family in there :) Sue",

The reason for that is the fees are set too low by the government. Anyway she's only going to charge the scheduled fee. The hospital accomodation, theatre fees etc are covered by private health insurance. Her little secretary also said she's going to tell the anaesthetist that they're doing it for no gap in the hope he will too. That's the best news for me as I was really worried about the cost as we went through all of my savings last year. Happy Thanksgiving girls!!!! Sue",

Baby onc (I told him I'm calling him that on here) said that subtype of IDC is still treated the same as regular IDC. I'm just lucky it wasn't in lots of nodes. One other lovely lady I found on here, that had the same pathology, had 18 out of 28 positive nodes!!! Now I'm worrying about the sentinel node biopsy - maybe they should have taken more nodes to be sure. I'm sure the surgeon would have wanted to do that if it was necessary.

I only know her from the bus going to work, but she actually came and took me out for morning tea when I was having chemo, so she deserves any support I can give her. My DH had to get up at an ungodly hour (4:30!!!) to go to golf, so I've been out chopping in the garden before it gets too hot. We recently got a rubbish bin for garden stuff. It's collected every 2 weeks. I've just filled it again. I swear I could fill it every week - I love it!!! ((((((((((HUGS)))))))))))) to everyone!!! Sue",

He just said he would continue to do it ie put the thing in - it did sting a bit. I can't believe I would get her again!!! After he was done, she came and injected some cortisone into the canula, then went off. A while later, I noticed blood coming out of my hand into the tube. The stupid bitch hadn't turned the drip on!!! I saw Paul, across from me, so I called him over and he turned it on. She is the MOST incompetent evil creepy nurse ever!!! I ended up not getting home until 6pm - that's from a  3:20 appt!!! I didn't feel too crash hot when I got home but seem to be ok now - might be on a steroid high - not sleepy yet. It was good to see Big Onc though. I had my usual list of questions for him. Told him I'm not having a mammo before we go overseas and he said fair enough :) I've decided to call the acupuncturist and make an appt. I need some help with the hot flushes and my not getting to sleep. He also might be able to help with this tinnitus I've got. They have proven in studies that acupuncture does help with hot flushes, so I may as well try it. We do know a really nice guy near us - he's a survivor from lymphoma and Steve has gone to him many times in the past - he has a really nice house and his treatment area is just lovely and smells so good. Not sure I'm ready to go back to work, I'm still really tired. I guess I just have to try it and see. I'm only doing 3 mornings to start with - not long now - eeek. Love to you all Sue",

Michele - I'm in the same boat - sore upper arm and DH insists I talk seriously to the GP about it today. Been googling symptoms of bone mets. It only hurts if I move it a certain way. Yesterday DH took his mobile phone out of my hand and my arm was accidentally pulled back and I literally screamed with pain. I did act it up a bit to get more sympathy, but the pain was terrible. That shoulder has a history of tendonitis and it is my mouse arm and I do spend too much time on the pc, so it could be a flare up of my old problem. Went and saw an ENT guy yesterday about my tinnitus - he was REALLY nice. He's ordered an MRI of my head to make sure there are no vascular tumours in the skull base. He really doesn't think there will be anything as my tinnitus is only when I cover my ears. He said inside my ears look terrific. Anyway, I'm glad about having the MRI as big onc never had my head scanned and I always worry about brain mets. I don't get headaches, so that's a good sign. He ruled out nerve damage from the carboplatin - he said it would have shown up in my hearing test. Sue",

They did the mammo and found something in the right breast (the left was the one with the cancer last year) - very small feather like thing at the back. Then they did 2 more mammos of that one only magnified. Then after waiting ages, they did the ultrasound. They can't see anything on it. Then she got another bird in to double check. She couldn't see anything either. Then they put me in a different US room with a different US machine - they couldn't see anything on that either. WTF????? I didn't take my mammo from last year so they couldn't compare it. I didn't think I actually had it at home. They called the old surgeon's office - they say they don't have it. I said \"isn't everything computerised - can't you get it that way\" - apparently not. Anyway, we agreed I would call and let them know if I had it at home - then if I didn't they would request a copy from the screening place where I went last year. Finally got home after 6pm not in a very good mood. Checked the place where all of my scans are and I don't have it. I'm sure the surgeon kept it when I went to visit him the first time and the prick has probably got rid of it since I dumped him. So, I guess it will be ages before I find out anything as they'll have to send me a release form to get the copy. I can't believe there would be anything there after all of the poison I've had and you would expect it would show on the ultrasound if it was anything of significance. So I'm not panicking (but DH is) and will just wait and see. I feel like my day off has been stolen from me, so I might just play hooky tomorrow. Sue",

I did actually speak to the director of the breast clinic which is something. They have breast physicians on staff - I was very surprised. There's definitely a change from last year's mammo - SHIT. But no need to freak out until we know what it is. I found out that if they can't see something on an ultrasound, they can use mammo somehow to do a biopsy. I called the surgeon's office to see if I could move my appt up to next week and they said to call after I speak to the breast clinic and they will squeeze me in - nice people. So, I now have the whole weekend to try and not worry too much - wish me luck. Sue",

At least they're not rushing in to do a biopsy - mainly because it's in a difficult location, so they want to be sure they need to do one before they go to so much trouble. Sue",

When we get the pathology back, then we'll know if she got clear margins etc. I hope she did. Also hoping Bonnie's little sisters are nothing. If they're something and different from Bonnie as in nasty - then we'll see. I guess if the path on Bonnie does come back as low grade (like the biopsy) and if her sisters are also, then it's another round of rads. I slept ok after banishing DH to the upstairs spare room :) Pain is minimal and wearing a soft bra is helping big time. I did end up cooking pizza myself last night - too easy and really yummy better than take out and cheaper. Turns out she is charging a gap on the first surgery so it is going to cost me but not as much. Plus the 2 anaethetists - SHIT!!! I got the wires put in before I got admitted so I should get most of that back from the government if they don't stuff up the billing of it.

He's got a point - it has been traumatic and expensive having to do all of this again. It's also been risky, Bonnie was some rare agressive subtype of ductal (trust me and the rare stuff) which is usually found in lots of nodes. Could be the chemo/arimidex has kept it under control so that's something. Apparently it's rare for that type to be node negative and so small so I am lucky in that. BTW - I have looked at the wounds - not too bad. The one from the 2 little sisters is bigger of course but the Bonnie scar is OK. Sue",

I called the breast clinic to check if they do that area and they do, but the doctor I spoke to said the bs's often send people back for another look. I won't be going there again as it's too far from home but can do it locally. I'm not worried too much as soft is good and you would think they would have noted it when I had the original done. She also wants me to get my goitre biopsied as it's grown - the likelihood of it being thyroid cancer is quite remote, still it's not nice to have to go and do it.

I'm recovering from a knee replacement - I finally got up the courage to have surgery after the whole BC experience - it took a while. I must say I was pretty miserable in hospital and screemed the place down, but 6 weeks on I'm starting to feel normal and am appreciating being able to straighten my leg and walk properly. When I had the surgery I woke up in ICU - we found out a week before the surgery I have atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat). Wondering if Herceptin has anything to do with it. I'm now on heart meds and all is good. Went out clothes shopping yesterday - I've lost about 17 lbs and none of my work clothes fit. It was my first shopping trip on my own - I took a crutch but didn't really need to use it. Saw the knee surgeon on Friday and he was pleased with my progress - I've got 125 degree bend which is good - aiming for 130. I go back in 6 weeks. I'm not going back to work for another couple of weeks as I have back trouble that needs fixing first. I'm aware of the 5 year mark coming up too my birthday is a constant reminder - the day I had the mammo - not looking forward to screening in October - would love to skip it, but they found a benign thing last year, so I'll have to keep going. So good to hear from you - I really miss all of our Nov09 chemo friends.",

From what I can understand from a friend I met on the Aussie BC forum - you don't have time to get better between the weekly taxol infusions - she can't remember being off the toilet much - sorry.

Sounds better than lying on your back. She was really really nice and recommended I have the planning sesion before the last treatment so that I'm well and don't have to wait until I recover from the tx. I start rads on 6th April. My onc will be really impressed I have it all set in concrete. We were planning a short holiday in between chemo and rads and were looking at flying somewhere, but I'm so sensitive about my lack of hair I don't want to get on a plane. I even stay away from the larger shopping centres because I feel so different. We ended up booking the same unit (at a fraction of the cost) we stayed in at the beach after Christmas - much cheaper than flying somewhere. DH had promised I won't have to cook much and will take me out for brekky and dinner. My No1 buzz is growing and I'm just going to leave it seeing the end is in sight. The taxol shouldn't make your hair fall out more. One friend said hers started growing when she started the taxol and she had a reasonable head of hair a week after her rads were done.

Unfortunately, I personally don't think it's safe to go into one of the public ones and the waiting lists are ridiculous. I could have gone to a public hospital for the radiation treatment for free but decided I would rather pay. I knew going in to it that it would cost me about $1200 and thought it was a small price to pay. I must work out how much surgery etc has cost me. Last count it was over 3,500 but once I add on the radiation, it will be quite a bit more. At least I paid absolutely nothing for the chemo treatments as they bill the insurance co directly and only charge the scheduled fee. Sugery etc was another matter - there are huge gaps. I paid the anaethetist $500 and only got back a bit over $200 and that was with insurance!! The hospital was free though - paid for by the insurance.

Linda and Sherri - the rads will be over before you know it. I missed you all so much. I did meet up with a lady from here while we were away. We had a long 2 hour chat. This forum means so much to me. Now I guess I have to start thinking about going back to work - poop. I'll see how the bone density test went when I have my 10th herceptin tomorrow - the onc never called with the results so I haven't started the Arimidex yet. Unfortunately my daughter gave me a cold while were away but it's just about cleared up. I'll call to see if it's ok before I go. I'm now officially going topless everywhere except when it's too cold. It's still really short but thickening up nicely. I'll post a pic when I get organised - I have loads of washing to do, no food in the house, got to get the cat etc etc. Love you all Sue",

Hang on, I think they might have injected the stuff and I had to go back later. Anyway, remember my back went out a while ago - I could hardly walk and it's fine now. Have you been very active?

We'll see what the doc says today, I may be able to use something more agressive on the area. I just noticed I've lost my bottom eyelashes - eeek!!!

He's been sticking so close to home since this all started that now it feels strange to not have him here. I'm still looking in my hand mirror to see if my hair has grown in the last 5 minutes :) It is actually looking and feeling thicker. I might pop in to the hairdresser today to see if they think I should get a buzz done to even up the length - then it might look thicker. But I like the long white fluffy fairy hairs so we'll see. Good luck for you girls with taxol treatments this week. Brenda:  Send me your hair pic so I can post it for you. ((((HUGS))))) Sue",

The skin breakdown was only in the crease underneath which is apparently pretty well unavoidable in large breasted women. I think if they had treated me lying face down it could have been avoided. The nurse told me it was because of the radiation going through 2 layers of skin. The doctor said it's because of rubbing skin on skin. Who to believe. Face down treatment would have meant a lot of setup and I reckon she couldn't be bothered. They should be letting you have your port out. I do know sometimes they like to leave them in for a while but our onc let Steve have his out straight away on both occasions. Alicia: Welcome home, I hope you had a great time on the cruise. I'm in the middle of booking hotels etc for our upcoming trip to Adelaide in South Australia - major wine growing area. Our daughter lives there and we're going down for a week on the 15th June.

She's expecting, and the delivery date is my birthday 24th September - I told her not to call the baby Susan.  She thought my hair growth was good for the time frame so I'll calm down about it :) I discussed my thyroid with her (they found a goitre on my CT scan) - she's an endocrine surgeon as well. She ordered an ultrasound and blood test. If the ultrasound shows it's not cancerous (she did say it's very rare) then she said we don't need to operate unless it causes any symptoms like inability to swallow. Didn't sound like an easy operation so I'd rather leave it alone. There seem to be quite a few cases of bc patients with thyroid issues. I wonder if they've done any research into it.

They lived it up in a flash hotel in the city for a few nights and then I insisted they come here for a couple of days. They are both still sick too. Maybe we can give them back this cold. DH is really sick and I seem to be getting bad again. It just won't go away.

DH got a big shock being in Sydney again (he is originally from there) - it's so different from when we lived there 31 years ago. I've been back a lot for work, so it's not such a big shock for me. We did go for a walk around the Opera house as DH had never done that before. We had one day of sight seeing and my legs were killing me. At least I did do a fair bit of walking every day - much needed seeing I've been sitting on my bum for so long. Thanks for the welcome home girls.

The trouble is this time they have to do one with a mammo and you lie on your tummy with boobs hanging down and the bed is raised up and the doctor has to go in under it. The mammo pictures are sent to a computer screen so they can locate the thing to stick the needle in. Sounds really dodgy. The other one can be done with the ultrasound but they are both in a tricky place to get at. They reckon that they are worried about the first spot as it doesn't show on last year's mamo. DH and I reckon we can see it. The 2 films are not quite the same resolution or the compression was different, but there is the same looking spot on both. The surgeon did say it's good neither spot took up much contrast. They couldn't fit me in for the biopsies today but will call with a time and day for me. Hope it can be done tomorrow.

She did say she would get the radiologist to review  everything. Obviously because the first spot turned out to be cancer, they're covering their arses and mine. They're going to try and locate it on ultrasound, if they can't, they'll do an MRI and put a clip in. This is the one that does not show on the mammo. Sounds like they want to biopsy it too. I saw the surgeon and it was her that told me they wanted me back - they'd called her. I'm glad in a way that they are being so thorough but it's driving DH crazy waiting. We have scheduled surgery for Tuesday week after next. Whether it will be a lumpectomy or mastectomy we don't know until we get the second spot sorted out and it depends on if both have to be removed and how close together they are. I'll be able to have my herceptin tx next Wednesday and it also gives me a chance to talk to big onc before the surgery. I asked the surgeon about the possibiliy of Bonnie being there last year and she said it's very possible and she confirmed my research into low grade tumour response to chemo ie that higher grade tumours respond to chemo a lot better. She also said that they wouldn't have questioned that spot last year as it only showed on one view on the mammo. So, more sitting around at that clinic - 9am tomorrow. I might take a packed lunch :) Sue",

Thanks for all of the hugs - I felt them!!!  She did 2 excisions as it would have had to be too big to do it in one. I'm so pleased she did that, I was hoping she would. The experts got the wires in no trouble. One using ultrasound and the other 2 with the mammo lying face down - now that was interesting. I was nearly late for surgery but she was late coming out of the previous one so it all worked out. Big onc came to see me in hospital last night and again this morning - what a sweetie. I won't see him for my last H tx next week as he's off to San Antonio for the bc conference. I feel ok but a little wobbly. I'm glad I stayed in for the night. I've got a soft bra on and it feels fine. It's better than no bra as it stops the wounds pulling. Good luck with your liver scan Linda - fingers crossed. Also, good luck with your check up Nette - I'm sure you will be fine. Love you girls!!!! Sue",

Yes we had New Year's eve before you guys. I've been gardening in the rain!!! I have now weeded and mulched 4 areas of the garden and my green bin is full - still lots left to do. I'll have to hold off doing any more until it's collected on Tuesday morning. We have only just had green bins delivered in our area and they are emptied once a fortnight - it's the best Xmas present ever for me - I love it. Of course it costs me extra on my rates bill but it's worth it. Not many people seem to have taken them up so far. We also get vouchers we can use at the dump and can dump stuff for free but it's a hassle covering the load and driving there to dump it. We emptied the trailer a week or so ago, so I have to resist filling it up again. Love and hugs to you all Sue",

When she tested it, she said - you've got lots of salt in there. Well, they are the ones who said to put 5 bags in - good grief. Anyway, it's all good - just looks a bit green, but that's from the salt apparently. Going for one of those lunches with my bc friend today to a garden centre where they have water dragons running around on the deck of the restaurant.

If they give it slowly you don't react so bad and should only have a reaction the first time. My onc lied to the government so I could get it - more for the prevention of recurrence than for the bones as my denisty wasn't too bad for my age. Your onc would probably have to order it done. My friend is no longer taking Arimidex because of how bad her bone density had become, but she was very lowly hormone recpetive, so he thinks they can get away with her not taking it. Sue",

Skin STILL looking really good. Sad news - a friend of mine was diagnosed with DCIS. The surgeon wants to remove the whole breast as he thinks there's more in there. He already did a surgical biopsy/lumpectomy and found 2 areas of DCIS - didn't get clear margins. She is so upset. I went and visited her yesterday, hoping someone calm might help. At least she won't have to go through chemo and rads. I hate cancer!!!! Sue",

I asked my onc about the tiredness and he said it is most likely from the Arimidex. Guess I'll just have to get used to it. I got him to check out under my arm as it has been feeling really tender. He thinks it's the bone hurting from the rads. The boob is still one big lump - wish it would soften up. Hey, only 5 naked H to go!!! Doesn't seem like much but it will take until December. Also asked him about the pain I get from my port sometimes. He said they might have to operate to fix it - stuff that!!! It's been ok since the tx so we'll see how it goes. It only happens when I move my right arm a certain way and then I get a sharp pain next to the port. It might be pressing on a nerve. Next week will be interesting, I'm attempting my first full day at work on Monday. Given that I'm really tired by 11:30am, not sure how it will go. I'll still do 2 half days Tuesday and Thrusday and have Wednesday off and then a full day on Friday. Have a great weekend girls!!! Sue",

One of her staff described them as \"wings\" and that is exactly the right description. Anyway, I asked for advice re the fluffy bits as I wasn't sure if I should get them cut as they would probably grow back the same. She said they probably wouldn't and offered to trim it on the spot. She also trimmed the back a bit. She said my waves are really strong. We've decided to leave colouring it for a while to see how it looks when it's longer. They still don't ask me to pay which is so lovely. I'm so pleased with how it looks now - hurray!!!! Sue",

So I feel none the wiser. We opened the films and read the report. The last line of the MRI report says that both lesions look benign. They did another ultrasound too and they can see the new thing on that but it says that it has benign features.   They tried to say that because I'd had treatment that may be why they don't light up on the MRI as if the treatment had lowered the grade - very strange statement. I've called big onc and left a message for him to ring me. I asked them to send him a copy of the reports but who knows if they will as they wrote it on a post it note. Anyway - if they didn't light up it's not cancer in my opinion. Now I have to wait and see what big onc and the surgeon think. Sue",

They put a wire in using the ultrasound, then did mammos to see if it hit the spot - they were high 5ing each other after that. Then they did the core needle biopsy - she took 3 samples. Then she put a clip in to mark the spot in case they need to locate it later, then another mammo to make sure the clip was in the right place. I'll get the results tomorrow afternoon - nice and quick. The bs won't be working then but the breast pyhsician said she would call me if she can't get the bs. I was only there 2 hours this time - much better. Turns out they couldn't have done the biopsy the day of the MRI after all as they were flat out, so I don't have to feel stupid for not doing it then.  I showed her the spot DH and I could see on last year's mamo and she agreed it looks like the same thing. The problem was, it wasn't visible on the lateral view last year but was on the lateral view of this year's. She did agree it looks much the same as last time - so that's something.

I think they circled it this year. This is a new breast clinic I'm going to and they seem to be much more thorough than the free government one. I've been researching tumors that don't respond to chemo and it looks like lower grade ones don't respond as well as high grade ones when chemo is given pre surgery. So, it's possible it was there last year and didn't grow or do anything. Big onc will be the one with the answers on that one. The main thing is, it isn't very big. I picked up my films from them yesterday and the pathology report was in the envelope. Sounds like she took a lot of it doing the core needle - she took 3 cores, so there won't be much of it left to cut out. The only way this could have been confirmed last year is with MRI. Unfortunately it not used in diagnosis enough. You would think if they find one thing, an MRI would be prudent before surgery to check both breasts. I can't believe Bonnie the Bitch grew in such a short time especially being low grade, so that makes me think it was there before. I'll let you all know when the surgery is. I'm kind of hoping she can't do it until after my tx on Wednesday as I'd like to see big onc first. ((((((((((((((Love and hugs)))))))))))))))))))) Sue",

Big onc confirmed that the chemo would probably have not had any effect on Bonnie. He does think I should get all spots removed. Also mentioned the possibility of a mastectomy but did say 2 lumpectomies would be fine if the surgeon agrees to do it that way.

The stupid idiots couldn't place the wires, some crap about my boob and my port being in the way and not being able to see the clips on mammo well enough. Anyway, I did have surgery - just the sentinel node biopsy. The surgeon said that seeing we had done half of the procedure we should go ahead and finish it. The node lit up beautifully with the blue dye and has been removed and sent off for testing. I woke up starving and they said I could go home if I felt well enough. I actually felt great so here I am. I could have stayed the night but the food sucked. Now my pee is blue :) There is absolutely no pain and it's nearly 7 hours since she did it. I've decided I like her even more after today - wish I'd gone to her last year. The plan now is to do the lumpectomy at the bigger hospital next Tuesday. So the experts at the breast clinic can do the wires. The surgeon was SO apologetic - she was so sure the people were competent - well obviously not. The good news is that the doctor who has been looking after me at the breast clinic will be back from holidays next week - I'm sure she'll be able to do it. And the food there is better. So, girls - we'll have to do another world wide hug next Tuesday. When I get the time of surgery, I'll let you know. Sounds like she's going to fit me in even though her list was full.

I've become very fond of her. The nurse I had yesterday was SO nice - I wanted to bring her home with me. She was stroking and soothing me while I was in the MRI thingy. These 2 extra tiny spots might be false positives. We are starting to think they could just leave them there and watch them and just chop out Bonnie but the doctors might disagree. They might be in different quadrants but they aren't all that far apart as the 2 tiny ones are towards the centre and all of them are in the lower part of the boob - she might be able to do them in one go. I'll go with what the surgeon says - at least now she has a picture of their location. It's a pain they can't biopsy them. Big onc can also have his input next week. The idea of a mastectomy is freaking me out - I hate surgery of any kind. I remember crying all the way to theatre for my knee arthroscopy and that's not big surgery by any means.  Have a lovely weekend - I'm out to lunch with my bc friend today and she's picking me up so I can have a few wines :) Sue",

So, I'm glad I'm going to the place near home as that's where I go for all of my radiology and I like the people there and they can't keep me for 6 hours as they have a closing time :) I go at 2pm Monday.

I stopped before the biopsy as I remembered the surgeon last year asking if I took it. I told the surgeon on Thursday and she said that was good as it will make her job a lot easier. I've been outside dabbling in the garden - didn't do much but did plant out a bromeliad I had in a pot. I have my sights on another garden I want to clean up but can't be bothered today. I'll have plenty of time while I'm off work. We just got our green bin delivered. We already have 2 garbage bins - one for general waste, one for recycling and now a green one!!! It will be emptied every other week starting in January - I bet I fill it all the time. Other big cities have had them for years and we were slow to get them. Have a great weekend girls!!! Sue",

There is no normal conversation just criticism and complaint. I didn't tell her about it until after I had the surgery last year and she was upset because I told my cousin in New Zealand before I told her. Well my cousin has had bc twice in the same breast and had a mastectomy and her Mum died from bc at 49. Of course she would be the first one I reached out to. She went on how she was the last to know, but I told her my brother over in the US actually was the last :) I had seen her in the past 2 years - she came up here to visit when I was having chemo but didn't stay long and went off in a huff after I asked her to stop saying nasty things about her sister. She lives on the Gold Coast - only 1 hour drive away. Her sister is more like a Mum to me - such a level headed lovely lady and Mum can't stand it that I get on with her so well. Enough of the family issues - I'm off to see the surgeon today. I hope she takes the dressing off the port wound - it looks like they've knicked my skin when they put it on and my skin is reacting to the dressing so it's a bit pink - but it doesn't hurt!!! Boob is starting to feel better - the antibiotics must be working. I made an appt to see big onc on the 29th to let him review the path on Bonnie - he can fill me in on all the news from San Antonio. Also want to show him last year's mammo. Xmas just isn't happening here - we have no one but us and the cat. DD and husband in Argentina on holiday - son in London. I have convinced my mother to come for Xmas breakfast. She's been invited to some people that have little kids and that would be so much nicer than sitting around complaining to us :) so she can stop here on the way to them hopefully for a very short while.

The top of the boob hardly shows any colour change. I'm going in to the city today to visit work - free curry lunch. Good opportunity for me to visit. Won't be long before I'll have to go back - I'm getting so used to watching TV and cross stitching. Spent hours on the computer yesterday, booking flights and hotels for our trip in August. The travel agent is a rip off, so I'm doing most of it myself. I've let him do the flight to London only and even then he charged more than the online price. Found really nice hotels in London, Paris and Edinburgh - Trip Advisor is so good for finding nice places. Our son is really looking forward to us coming. His wife is due to give birth in June, so the trauma of all that will be over by the time we get there. I don't know what I'll do if I don't like her - I still haven't met her as you might remember. Being a granny for the first time is really scary - not something I like to think of much. I know it will happen one day, but they could have waited until I was 60 at least.

It was like I'd shut down. Well, yesterday was such a lovely day - I asked him to pump up my tyres and suggested we go for a ride. We went way further than I would have on my own, but I managed quite well. I did feel great after it. I hurt my back again on Friday morning and it was hurting a bit riding, but by the time we got home it actually felt better. We have a bike track that follows a brook near us, so we don't have to ride on roads for very far before we hit the track. You can ride for miles and miles on it. We did 6.5 miles according to his bike computer. Don't eat too much chocolate :) Sue",

I'm not noticing the aches are any worse than I had before. Make sure you take stuff for your bones as they can cause osteoporosis. Had my hearing checked yesterday - a slight loss for high pitch noise but that could be age related. Doesn't solve my pulsatile tinnitus though. I expect the GP will refer me to an ear, nose and throat specialist. I'd better go and see him next week and see what's next. Zometa infusion next week - eeek!!!

I am also going to see a genetic specialist next week and have been ringing around to find out info about my first cousins here in Australia. My Aunt in Sydney gave me the phone no for a cousin in Tasmania and I called him. I haven't seen this guy since I was 11 years old and only met him the once. He was such a nice bloke we had a really long chat. He was able to give me the info I required. One of his sisters had bc about 10 years ago. I've also called her and left a message as he said she was doing a family tree and I'm really interested in my mother's side of the family. Hope she calls me back. They are of a family of 12 (my mother's brother's children) - none of whom I've seen since that one visit all those years ago. It doesn't sound like they are close at all which is a shame. I'm only going to see this specialist for the sake of our kids. Normally it costs about 100 out of pocket but seeing I've hit the safety net here again, it should only cost me 20 so I figured why not. Hugs to you all Sue",

He wants me to have the gene testing owing to the high incidence of cancer in my father's family. It costs $1,600, so I told him no - we can't afford it. He's going to refer me to the local public hospital and see if they will do it for free. They have some points system that gives you a score for risk and if you get enough points they'll test you.

The actual cost was $488 but because I've reached both safety nets, I got almost all of it back. Any radiology is not covered by private insurance but is covered by the government. Because of the high cost of rads, I reached the safety net really quickly this year, so we've been doing lots of doctors visits eg dermatologist, ENT guy, geneticist. I'm hoping they didn't find anything except a brain. The ENT guy was humouring me because I wanted to make sure my tinnitus wasn't caused by anything sinister, he doesn't expect there is any problem.",

This week was stuffed up because we had a holiday on Monday, so I only did 3 full days. So, I really need to do 4 days next week before I take the big plunge. Still can't wait to go back on full pay. I'm all organised and made an appt with the GP for next Wednesday to get a letter for work. My new project at work kicks off on Tuesday, so here's hoping I will have lots to do. I have found if I have something interesting to do I don't get tired and the days just fly by. Hey, my Mother is over there visiting my brother near Seattle. I think they are flying to Chicago and then driving back to Seattle and prospecting on the way - wish him luck as Mum is very difficult. Have a great weekend girls Sue",

I ended up having a chat with my team leader and he invited me to a meeting about a new small project I'll be working on. I now have stuff to investigate pending the start of the project, so I feel a bit better. Yesterday I noticed all of the other programmers going to a meeting and I hadn't been invited, but I went anyway. Turns out I'm not on some mailing list so got left out. This sort of stuff can be really upsetting. I'm going to be added to the list, so I should be included in the future. Hey Brenda - how are the peeps? When do they start laying? How are you? Michele - how are you managing without your DH? Is he in the military? At least he's not in Afghanistan. I'm off for yet another hair cut today. Isn't it great to look in the mirror and see a full head of hair!!!! They say herceptin inhibits hair growth and I'm starting to agree. It's been growing like a weed since I finished the H. DH freaked out and said don't get it cut too short, but I'll do what I like. I'm still trying to get those curls cut off.

Bloody Steve has booked us on a cycle trip in New Zealand next February - eek!! I't s apparently an easy ride but I haven't been on my bike for ages and will have to ride regularly now or I'll end up travelling in the support vehicle the whole way. I did a half hour ride ok, so I'll gradually increase it over time. My hair is still gorgeous - after 4 months it's not showing any signs of needing to be redone. The hair dresser will get a shock when I go for my next cut and streaks soon. Hope you are all good. I was just telling a lady we met recently about this site last night and told her about you lovely ladies and how we still keep in touch.

Don't worry, I'm certainly not the silent type. I was going to have a go at her for having me treated lying on my back when I'm sure face down would have been better because of my floppy boobs. The nurse said I got the problem because of the fold under the breast and the radiation was going through 2 layers of skin.

Others have said the growth is slow on Herceptin, but a friend of mine had AC-TH and her hair grew quite quickly even while she was on the weekly taxol. 1 week after rads her hair looked great - like TreadSoftly's above. Like you, I am nearly 11 weeks PFC and it does seem to be slow growing. I'm using Nioxin System 6 and do think it's helping keep the scalp healthy. I might look for some biotin today, but I'm taking fish oil, glucosamine, caltrate plus and anit inflams  - not to mention the impending Arimidex and bisphosphonates - so I might start rattling.

Of course if you have chemo, you have rads after chemo. 11 weeks does seem a long time to wait, I think it's optimal to start earlier than that. There was a thread here somewhere where someone was asking the maximum time to wait. You shouldn't need chemo being node neg. The only reason I had chemo the first time was because of the HER2 factor. What grade was it? Lower grades don't always respond to chemo anyway - proven to me by my second lower grade one being there during the chemo for the first and not disappearing but only maybe being kept under control. I'll try and find that thread about the time for rads for you. Sue",

How long a delay is safe? If you are not having chemotherapy, radiation treatment should begin as soon as possible after your incision heals, usually within 8 weeks after surgery. It is generally believed that radiation treatment should not be delayed longer than 12 weeks after surgery, although there is no proof to support this. If you are having chemotherapy, most cancer centres recommend that radiation treatment be delayed until chemotherapy is finished. Sometimes both kinds of treatment are given together. However, there is no evidence that this improves the outcome, and it can increase the risk of unwanted side effects, especially if any of the anthracycline drugs (drugs like Adriamycin) are used as part of your chemotherapy.  and this : http://news.health.com/2010/03/04/radiation-most-effective-soon-after-breast-cancer-surgery/ Sue",

A friend of mine had a mastectomy for DCIS (multiple) and I said to her \"Maybe I should have had a BMX\" - she said \"no way\", it's been really tough on her and she wishes she hadn't had to have one. After TE and implant, she's had to have surgery on the other breast to match the size. I will have to have a BMX if I ever get another bc, but I'm glad I didn't so far. Both cancers were really small and I have big boobs, so there is no difference from how they were before except for a small dent in one.",

My surgeon was a general surgeon but she only does breast/thyroid surgery. If the breast physician has sent you to someone, they would know if he concentrates on that type of surgery. I doubt they would have sent you to someone who wasn't capable but you could ask around or google that doctor and see if you can find his web page or something. That should show you thetype of surgery he does.",

It was a research article which showed she had responded well to herceptin. Reading that scared me - lucky I was offered chemo/herceptin - you can't take the risk no matter what.",
