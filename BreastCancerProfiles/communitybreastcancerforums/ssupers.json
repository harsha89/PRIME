I also don't know much about my BC. All I know is he put a rush on it and I'm seeing an oncologist and starting chemo next week then radiation then breast removal. Hoping its not spread all over the place but I have no idea. My husband thought about a second opinion. I said no. I don't think we should waste another week before chemo. I have 3 girls. 28, 24 and 21. I want to live!! This is just unbelievable. Hang in there. I'm going to just take this a day at a time! Thinking of you. Be strong and positive.",
