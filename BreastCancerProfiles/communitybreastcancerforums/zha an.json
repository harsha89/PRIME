I had a severe inflammatory reaction to the methylene blue dye used during my sentinel node biopsy. It caused large swelling and immediate formation of a large hard lump that extends from the nipple out about 3\". It is about 1/2\" deep maybe more. The area around it is still very painful 4wks out and I still need pain meds most days and at night to try and get a bit of sleep. My surgeon has never seen anything like it and my RO has never heard of such a thing happening! Additionally I have a sizeable hematoma that formed 9 days post op. It is now hard as a rock. Between the 2 lumps half my breast is involved. I see my surgeon tomorrow and will insist on an US of both to see just how deep the dye reaction is. He did one on hematoma 2wks ago but just stared at the dye reaction in horror! I have been using moist heat, castor oil packs and massage (ouch) to try and break up this mess with little reduction in size. Has anyone else started radiation while dealing with hematomas? I just don't think I can do this right now....any advice appreciated!

I was concerned because I had noticed that swelling increases when I'm up and about or use my arm much and it extends around side to back, although not a lot. I live in a rural area 63 miles from specialized care but will chk w local PT to see if he's had specialized LE training. Would my PCP be able to do the referral or does it need to be from a specialist? Everything caught up with me and I have been really overwhelmed especially today so think I'll wait to look at LE section. ...doing my ostrich impression for a couple of days to try and find my center once again. I don't have family support but have reached out here and to my treatment team members so trust that this feeling will pass. Because of the complications from both surgeries I have been in constant pain since 9/12....so not sleeping very well. It's taking it's toll....thank you for reaching out to me..it helps! Zha-an",

Just got back from surgeon so a plan is in place...we postponed simulation until Nov 19th to allow swelling, inflammation and pain to settle down. The US showed that the hard area is a 1/2\" thickened dermal area surrounded by diffuse tissue swelling but no pockets that can be drained to speed things along. Fortunately there was no sign of necrosis. he recommended that I continue the castor oil packs and actually expand the treated area to increase lymphatic circulation and hopefully reduce swelling (and pain!) the surgeon has never seen the reaction that I had to the 3cc of methylene blue dye...also couldn't find anything similar in the literature...leave it to me! If there is an odd or scary reaction that can happen...I'll be the one in a million that has it! My poor doctors....my hematoma is smaller and doesn't really hurt like the other mess...hvnt slept thru nite in 4 wks from pain...ridiculous! Oh well, this too shall pass!

The cosmetic result is not an issue at this point since it already looks like cr*p. I had an especially ugly reaction to the dye used for the SNB...i now hv a 4\" diameter circle of hard tissue surrounded by tissue that was first inflammed but is now broken capillaries (pettechia?) also we've taken so much tissue & part of areola after it died from retractor injury....poor girl hangs considerably lower than her droopy counterpart! Sooo already will need some fluff & stuff plus tattooing once radiation is completed.... I'll post once I know our next step and reason for it. also...did anyone else experience dramatic swelling after SNB? I didn't hv any after lumpectomy but re-excision w SNB (1 node) has resulted in a breast twice its normal size! Yipes! Now I know what my larger breasted warriors go thru! Because of a 4 hr post op I didn't get my compressing sports bra on to help keep swelling down. Anyone hv ideas on what has worked for you? If I hv another excision I will ask surgeon to order bra on as soon as I come too! Sucks that we learn things the hard way...  I am also dealing w an apparent hematoma since Thursday nite...obvious bruising that has been growing since then and severe pain since Saturday afternoon. My PA said to get US and possible drainage when I see surgeon tomorrow, especially if we don't go back in. I have an underlying genetic tissue disorder that makes my tissues more fragile so guess that increases my risk. I also had a large seroma/hematoma w lumpectomy that was dealt w during 2nd surgery. The fun just keeps on coming doesn't it! anyhow dear sojourners on this wild ride...thanks for being so supportive and letting me vent. BTW I meet my new oncologist Wed afternoon via a telemedicine appointment. That way I only hv to drive 25 miles ea way instead of 65! My PA said the new doc is great and that I'll get great,supportive care from her! And she WILL Order the Oncotype testing ...things are looking up.    zha-an",

      "Content": "Oct 10, 2014 08:22PM - edited Oct 10, 2014 08:28PM by zha-an thank you ladies for taking time to share your wisdom and experience...  I emailed my surgeon's office middle of night (sleep just isn't happening) and office mgr responded to let me know that my doc was out of town but that she called him and he wants to see me Mon. I'm thinking that another excision is in my future and I'm ok with that since radiation may have to wait until spring if things don't start happening soon. I live 75minutes from the cancer center and doing a daily drive in winter fog or snow wdnt be safe. I am applying for financial aid from a local group that might help me stay close to the center during the week so hopefully it will all work out like it shd!  the nurse told me that it is likely that the lumpectomy got all of the IDC noted in the inked margins and that's why no sign of it in this re-excision tissues. I plan to get clarification on Monday. If any questions then I will try and get another opinion but need insurance to pay as I have few financial resources. I am also in the process of changing oncologists. The one I see now is much closer to my home but has stubbornly refused to order oncotype testing and has been sure that my cancer is more advanced than any of my other docs. I asked my primary for her opinion as I trust her and her response was \"I have sent a stat referral to Dr X\". Figure that said it all! While I will hv a longer drive I will be at same large institute as my RO, whom I really like. Everyone will hv access to my electronic chart...no more faxing to this Dr or that Dr so I think I'll have better continuity of care. Plus I will have the benefit of the institute's tumor board rather than just one opinion on best Tx . I've only seen the current oncologist once and his NP once and both times I felt unheard. Both refused to do Oncotype test unless my SNB came back clear even though as a post menopausal, Er,Pr+(99%..)her2 negative tumor I met testing criteria even if SNB was positive. I also made it clear that I won't consider chemo UNLESS My oncotype showed a benefit that exceeded risk. I have an underlying neurological condition that would make chemo even more dangerous than it can be for us all. Still, they wdnt order and now it will be weeks before I get that info. Have to fight cancer...shouldn't have to fight my oncologist! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!! Thanks for letting me vent. I'll post Mon after I meet w surgeon. hope everyone has a good weekend zha-an",

Wahoo and what a relief however the medial margin is only 1mm from a 5.8mm focal DCIS and .5mm from hyperplasia area. This medial margin was also the most involved on original pathology report.  my surgeon removed an additional 1.7cm of tissue from this area so I am very concerned that a 1mm margin isn't enough! another odd, but good thing...original pathology showed IDC on 3 other margins but the re-excision pathology shows clear tissue with no IDC on all 3 this time. Guess I'm a bit confused on how 3 margins could be compromised before with IDC but be absolutely normal this time. Not trying to borrow trouble mind you.. But since the tissue samples sent this time contained the \"IDC compromised\" margins from before how could the sample be completely clear now. Shouldn't their have been some IDC at the beginning of the sample and then a clear margin? I'm concerned that either it was a false positive before or was missed this time. How could it just disappear? The first pathology report was poorly written and both my BS and RO were confused by it regarding the tumor size so I don't have the highest confidence in the reporting pathologist! any thoughts on either of these issues? Shd I try for a wider margin? I probably won't hear back from my surgeon until Monday as he does surgery all day today and this is stressing me out!   thanks for listening!

My MO has wonderful qualifications and I appreciate his willingness to serve rural communities but since our first meeting I have felt that he thought my cancer was more advanced than any of my other doctors. His rational for doing the PET/CT scan was to see \"where the cancer has spread\" not \"if\" it had spread. My surgeon, RO,PS and primary all referred to my BC as early stage so I was scared spitless waiting for the scan results. My RO and my own research both supported your thoughts about the additional value of the info contained in the Oncotype testing but MO said it only says if you need chemo and you will need it... Slow down...told the NP whom I like better that I will not do chemo unless they prove I need it.  because my tumor was hormone receptive I meet Genomics guidelines and Medicare and my supplemental policy will cover the cost...i just need the darn thing ordered! I'm assuming that MO will order it if node negative on final pathology but can not even say that w any certainty...time will tell. at any rate I feel much better after reading your experience w this test. I will do whatever is necessary to get it ordered as soon as I get final pathology as I don't see NP until 15th and understand results take up to 10 days to receive...i need to get a plan in place so I can relieve some of my stress. I'm the sort that needs all available info to make a decision and then once that's done I'm able to relax a bit and move forward. Who knows, maybe my testing will even show that I have options on hormone therapy...wdnt that be wonderful! Was not aware that was ever an option although I knew AI and I wd not get along...not willing to add joint pain/stiffness to the high level of pain I already live with 24/7.

I know that if that is the case then my MO is willing to do Oncotype testing but if even 1 cell shows up then he won't order it. According to guidelines I wd still be eligible for testing as I am post menopausal and Er,Pr+(99%), her2 neg. I had an unusual presentation of my IDC in that it had smooth, well defined edges w no spiculation. The only reason it was birad 4 was due to limited blood supply present on Doppler US. My BS was so sure it was benign...alas it was IDC. Pathology showed very low mitosis but other grading factors were intermediate in nature. Ki67 was 10-20%(don't know actual %). My RO wants the MO to order the Oncotype testing as she feels it will help me decide on whether to do chemo or not. I have an underlying neuro condition that increased the chance of chemo induced problems so this is a BIG decision for me. If my Oncotype score is low..even if I hv a positive node I will pass on chemo. Quality is as important to me as quantity. sorry to go on and on...my question...can I demand this test? I need to know my right as a patient. If necessary I will chg MO even tho it would mean an extra 60 miles of driving.
