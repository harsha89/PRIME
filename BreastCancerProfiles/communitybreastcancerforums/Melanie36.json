I live a bit out of town from the cancer centre, but I'm open to the once a week thing if they can coordinate it with my weekly stage IV support group meetings.

I hate being a part of the Xeloda Floppers Club, especially since it didn't work and I went through all that pain and peeling for nothing. Jeanne46, Elizabeth, ElaineD, Dreamwriter, Jean, Padiddle- as much as I would love to delay chemo, I've already delayed it once for these 2 trips (thinking I was going to continue Xeloda) so Dr. does not want to delay anymore. Since Disney is during week 2, he thinks I should be over the \"worst of it\". I picked up my free wig and head coverings from the \"Guardian Angel\" room at our Cancer Centre today. The wig wouldn't be my first pick but it was all they had that was remotely close to my natural hair and it looked the best. I think I'll still buy one from the wig place, though. I'm not sure I'm ready for this phase. Some women shave it off well before hand, others have head shaving parties, with family involved, and yet others wait until it falls out on it's own...I guess I'll have to take it day by day and decide then.

I don't know the first thing about this drug and/or it's side effects, and am really mad at how this is going to change my day to day life. I've been given the option to take it once a week or once every 3 weeks. The latter is more convenient, but the former would probably be less harsh on my body? Any suggestions?

Of course I was terrified, I knew what this meant and immediately had this uncontrollable fear that I wouldn't even make a year. The women on this board have been an inspiration and are helping me to overcome this fear. I can't remember where I read this quote but it has stuck with me... \"Last time I checked the bottom of my foot, there was no expiry date.\" Fitztwins, who is a regular poster on this site also said something powerful and has stuck with me. \"I don't believe in stats, never asked after my second year ...

About the pain...I'm not a doctor, but one thing I learned was that not every pain and ache is related to the cancer. This was a very hard concept for me to accept and I kind of abandoned my regular doctor for several months after my dx. Remember the Oncs deal with all things cancer related. If you are having pain and he/she says it's not related, then I would go to my regular Dr. and ask. I've been having these horrible pains at the top of my stomache  where the ribcage meets. After telling several of my friends about it, 2 or 3 times I've heard people say it sounds like it could be my gallbladder. They're not Dr.s either, but it reinforced the fact that Dr.s all have specialties and that your Onc can't be expected to dx everything. My CT scan also showed that I have a kidney stone and polyps on my uterus...so I'm just waiting for those things to flare up on me...lol. Being HER2+ you do have the option of Herceptin as another piece of ammo.
