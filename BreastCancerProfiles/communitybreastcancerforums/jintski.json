It really is so encouraging to hear some many positive stories, I have had liver mets for just over a year, but have met a lovely lady who has had them for over 8 years, they have been kept stable with a constant dose of capecitabine. Try not to worry to much Mary, my oncologists doesn't even do markers.  I really hope this second chemo does the trick and reduces those liver mets! ",

Hope you can relax ans stop worrying now. xx",

I have drawn a blank over accessing information about faslodex.  I googled it and was directed to this forum, I was amazed by the scale compared to what we have in the UK, so decided to ask a few questions. I have had secondary BC since April 2010, extensively in my hip and femur, patches in my ribs, spine, neck and shoulder and a tumour in my chest. Although I am 100% oestrogen + Tamoxifen, Aromasin and Femara have all failed to keep my cancer at bay.  After a progression to my liver in November I have been changed over to Faslodex.  I guess I am wanting stories of people having failed treatments and switching to Faslodex and everything stabilising (or dare I hope... disappearing?) I also would like to hear of possible side effects, are shooting pains a SE?  I have shooting pains in my leg and neck, is this likely to be a side effect of the Faslodex working?  Or is it (as I keep imagining) a more likely sign that it's not working and the cancer is continuing to progress?

I am reluctant to write 'headache', as it feels like the pain is on my scalp rather than inside my head. It started last time I had my faslodex and Zometa and has been almost constant since. I guess I want somebody to tell me it is a side effect of the treatments, as you can imagine I am now trying not to fear the worst! and some recent brain mets diagnoses are putting my brain into overdrive:o( It isn't like a headache more like a prickling on my scalp or a dull throb. My head felt a bit like this when I had chemo, just before I lost my hair! I hope I wasn't given the wrong treatment when I last had Zometa!!! :o) Or does anyone have experience of skull mets that can explain what they feel like, this is actually a possibility, as a know I have cancer at the very top of my neck, so upwards onto the skull is a likely progression I guess. I am a teacher and have considered head lice, but there is no evidence of these little beasts! I am waiting for a full body CT scan appointment to be sent through and have a oncologist appt for the 2nd March, so I don't think it is necessary to phone the hospital. I am just hoping this is something without a sinister explanation. Have a lovely weekend all Jintski Log in to post a reply",

I am new to this site and new to liver mets.  I was diagnosed with bone mets in quite a few places last April, was changed to Femara from Aromasin (after Tamoxifen).  Then end of Nov 2010 was diagnosed with liver mets. 2 lesions that I know of, but wasn't told the size, only that because they were in 2 different places, surgery wasn't an option!  I was changed to faslodex and as yet have had no appts so don't know whether it is working or not...lots of shooting pains to affected bones sites, don't know if this is a sign of healing or further progression.  Would be interested in how liver mets are treated in the rest of the world. I assumed that I would have chemo, but am trying another hormone, don't know if this would be the case elsewhere, I worry that 3 have failed so far :0( why should faslodex be any different?  Reading some of your comments so far has given me hope.  What I have read on many websites in the UK has hardly instilled me with hope!  Denny hearing of 6 1/2 years is amazing, lets hope the rest of us are reporting figures of 6 1/2 (and above!!!) in the future.  Thank you for giving me back some hope. I will follow this thread with interest if this is OK?  sending you lots of good wishes from England SG",
