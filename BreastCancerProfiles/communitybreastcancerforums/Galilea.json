    "Content": "Galilea wrote: I'm new to this forum and so appreciate the information. I had my first round of Taxotere-Cytoxan two weeks ago. I feel like it went well. I had awful pain in my ankles and hips but I think that was more from the Neulesta than the chemo? I had a headache that felt like a bad hangover and some mild stomach issues and acupuncture helped a lot. I have one week left before round two. I know everyone is different but any thoughts about what I can expect? Do you think I'll be feeling similarly or does it get progressively worse? Log in to post a reply",
