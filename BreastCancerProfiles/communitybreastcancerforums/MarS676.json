I couldn't do it face to face so I called my dad first and I could hear him crying on the other end. I can't get that sound out of my mind. I thought it would be hardest to tell my sons (13 and 19) but they handled it pretty well. My parents though are pessimist and only see the bad things in everything. I love them to death, but I can't handle negativity right now. I'm trying my best to stay positive and my dad's response had set me back to the day of my diagnosis. I'm back to being worried and scared. How have you all handled breaking the bad news?
