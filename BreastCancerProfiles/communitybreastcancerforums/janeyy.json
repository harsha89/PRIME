I've been reading posts in this forum for almost two years; never posted anything but have found strength and hope in other's posts. now I felt the need to write a few words. To summarise: My mother has stage IIIV Breast cancer, with bone mets. Diagnosed right off the bat two years ago, the doctors found it by coincidence. She's been in fantastic condition for 98% of the time. She's in her 50s, very active. The last month or so however, has been horrendous. They have found mets in her liver and she has been hospitalised and very ill for weeks. They have been draining her for Ascites the last couple of weeks, and they did a biopsy of her liver, where they discovered liver mets. It really came out of the blue, as she\u2019s been feeling good and living her life very normal. The biopsy showed the cells in the liver had attacked the liver very quickly and viciously. They were considering whether it was triple negative, but it turns out it\u2019s HER2+ (sorry if it\u2019s not the 100% correct term, I\u2019m no doctor). As well as Chemo they are giving her an injection every three weeks in her thigh. She's on taxol now, and have had two rounds of it so far, but is reacting terribly to it. Very sore throat and mouth, fatigue and she struggles with lots of Ascites in her stomach. She's had taxol before (months ago) and didn't feel a thing then, so this is new. I'm scared they might need to take her off it. She\u2019s not eating enough and can barely talk. She has not been in any clinical trials and her oncologist, which is one of the leading experts where we live, says they want to wait to get her back on their feet before they consider that. Would mean a lot to me if anyone has any experience with this or any advise to give.",

She has had a lot of ascites in her abdomen the last couple of months, and she\u2019s had it drained maybe four times? For her it really helps. She says it\u2019s not painful, it\u2019s effective and it improves her breathing and appetite. She always feels much better after. Hope that helps. Good luck to you and your friend!",
