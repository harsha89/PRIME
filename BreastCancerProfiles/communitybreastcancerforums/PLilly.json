What precautions should I take while I'm up there? Yvette Dx 5/11/2006, IDC, 2cm, Stage II, Grade 3, 1/10 nodes, ER+/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

The NP from my doctor's office left me a message today saying that it was okay to ski and stated the same thing you said about doing the arm exercises plus to rest and hydrate myself between runs and to bring an Ace bandage with me to wrap my arm with if it shows any sign of swelling. She didn't think I needed to get a sleeve since I haven't been diagnosed with LE or shown any symptoms of it yet.  Alice Jean -  I 'm sorry to hear that you have bone mets.  I'm glad that your treatment is working and hopefully even those little spots here and there will disapear. Binney -  Yikes, I had no idea that the hot tub was a risk- I've been doing that for almost 6 months now. Thanks for the LE website there is a lot of good info there I didn't know about. Thanks again for the info and the stories you made my day! Yvette",
