They worked pretty quickly, too.   They come in a small box as they are only about 3 inches tall.   They can be tricky to find so I had my pharmacy order them for me by the case (be sure to keep your receipts for your taxes as, if you use them every day, the $$'s add up).  Believe me, I tried EVERYTHING and I too was at the point where they were talking surgery... I was scared and frustrated and very uncomfortable.  But these babies did the trick...I hope they work for you, too.  LeeLee",

They work very differently than ducolax and regular suppositories/enemas.   I urge you to try these.    I hope they help.  Good luck.  Big hugs, Nixi    ",
