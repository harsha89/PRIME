So why is it that people say to you, \"it's just hair\"? I have had many people ask me about how things are going. When I mention that I feel pretty good, but waiting for my hair to grow back.....they make that comment. Yes I know it is just hair, but when you have none it is a pretty big deal. It is the one visible thing that reminds me of what I have gone thru. It reminds me of the poison that was pumped through my veins.",

You can tell when my pigment cells kicked back into gear. I think if I would get a trim my hair would look less grey. I would get rid of those white ends. I may go this weekend with my husband to his barber. She trimmed my hair a few weeks ago(she was a hairdresser) and said she would help me grow it out. She has been through the process with a few women. Cheaper than going to my normal salon. Kate you are getting close if you are just waiting for the temples to fill in.

I also felt much better once I colored it. I was looking at old pics of me the other day, oh how I miss my long hair. This hairdo is super easy to do though.

I actually got more compliments on my wig from complete strangers than I did with my real hair. I don't know if anyone has mentioned the sticky lint roller tip to you. Once you buzz your hair off, all those little hairs will fall out as well. They are sharp and stick in your clothes. If you use a sticky lint roller on your head it picks those little hairs up. I never totally lost my eyebrows, but my eyelashes didn't fall out until 12 weeks PFC. When my new lashes started growing in, it pushed the old lashes out. They came in quite quickly. I love the sewer rat comment. Not only do you look like a sewer rat, but pretty much feel that way too. Kate and Octogirl, I'm sure by March your hair will have filled in and you won't feel so bad going hatless. A few weeks makes a huge difference.",

I was much stronger during active treatment than I am now. I think I was so focused on treatments and appointments I didn't actually process what I was going thru. Once I was done I actually looked back at what I had been thru and it hit me like a tonne of bricks. I didn't want others to see me as weak so I have held a lot of it inside. I was probably in the best shape of my life when cancer struck. I have struggled with the fact that I am not strong like I used to be. I go to the gym and it totally exhausts me. Our bodies have been through turmoil and my brain still thinks I can do what I used to but my body just can't. I do what I can but it is slow to come back. Just when I was feeling stronger, I had my exchange surgery and have been limited again. It feels like one step forward and 2 steps back. I have been off work since June. I am scheduled to go back April 15. I am terrified to return to the real world. I have a complicated situation that I am going back to. I need to be on my A game as I work in a highly specialized field. I don't feel anywhere near my A game,but on the other hand I feel like I need to get out of the house. We got snow here again last night and I am starting to go stir crazy cooped up in the house. Like SoCalGrl says I think about \"it\". On a side note, I have gotten so many compliments on my short hair. It is super easy to do. It takes me more time to fill my eyebrows in with pencil than it does to do my hair. I will be keeping it shorter for awhile. Especially until summer is over. You ladies have been such a great support for me. You make me feel \"normal\"....whatever that is....Still trying to adjust to the New Me. I think I am getting closer and feel like I can see glimpses of my old self coming back. We will forever be changed by what we have gone through. This shitshow will not define us. I found this quote yesterday and I am going to live by it....truly live and not just exist!    ",
