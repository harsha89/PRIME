My multi contains the B vitamin group too. All of these things have worked really well for me in the past. And yes, insist on the nausea medication when you speak to the anesthesiologist. The past few surgeries, I've woken up feeling just great - no nausea whatsoever. After trial and error with my earlier surgeries, the one that works for me is ondansetron. Metoclopra was tried once and does NOT work for me. Unfortunately, unless you know which ones do/don't work for you, your anesthesiologist might not get it right the first time. Luckily, I am able to inform the anesthesiologist of the one that works for me. ",

      "Content": "Feb 14, 2017 07:39PM - edited Feb 14, 2017 07:40PM by candles1 Yvonne M, The low residue diet is the one typically prescribed before abdominal or bowel procedures to reduce the amount of matter in the intestines. I find it's useful for any surgery because it doesn't produce as much material that will just end up sitting in your intestines for a few days due to the anesthesia. Google \"low residue diet\" and you will see all sorts of examples of what to choose and what to avoid. What I like on the list is probably different than what you would like. But in addition, it's a matter of eating as lightly as possible to reduce not only the bulk but the overall volume of what's about to just \"sit there.\" So, it's not enough to just choose low bulk foods, but also it's important to reduce the volume of the food you eat. Choose healthy foods because it's also really important to keep up your strength and stamina. Protein is so important. Since you have some time, you could experiment with how your body reacts to upping your dose of Mucil. If your surgery were tomorrow, I would not advise increasing your normal dose ... just before surgery is probably not the time to be experimenting with the amount of fiber you take, and how you react to it. I personally do step up the metamucil before surgery, but that works really well for my system. Metamucil is bulk forming, but combining it with the low residue diet a few days before surgery really clears me out pretty well and keeps things moving afterward too.",

      "Content": "Feb 28, 2017 03:07PM candles1 wrote: Hi all - I had my surgery yesterday. I had a BMX and the PS determined that my skin was viable enough to handle a \"direct-to-implant\" reconstruction. (This is the report from my husband-I won't see the docs until later today most likely). I don't know exactly what type of implant I got. I peeked and it looks a bit uneven, but surprisingly like my old self. I was able to do a nipple and skin sparing reconstruction. My surgeons re-used my old scars so no change there. Here is my experience so far: I climbed on the table at about 12 pm and my husband said it was all over by 2:45. I spoke to the anesthesiologist about the anti-nausea med that works for me, and it worked again. Zero nasuea, but very hungry when I came to. I wasn't - and still am not - thirsty at all, having drunk close to a gallon a day all week, and a bit over a gallon on Sunday. My veins were an easy stick (I can be a hard stick if dehydrated). I ate very sparingly Sunday and the day before. I know I won't have a bowel movement for a few days, but when I do, it will be small and easy (I'm taking my colace faithfully, and when I get home I will insert a prep H suppository - sorry if tmi). The anesthesiologist performed a double nerve block (since I was having a double mastectomy) on me just before I climbed on the table. Apparently this greatly enhances pain relief, but ALSO has been proven to reduce future breast cancer recurrence! Something to do with far less irritation during surgery that can \"anger\" or \"awaken\" bc cells throughout the body. Something to request when it's your turn! I feel perfectly fine right now. I've gone to the bathroom (pee) and I can raise my arms pretty high up (tho I think I'm not supposed to). I mean, if I had to wash my hair, I think I could, if sitting down and bending my head down. I think I could dry my hair bending over, too. I've been told I can shower when I get home. I have walked all around the hospital floor by myself - the nursing staff determined I'm not a fall risk. My room is lovely and has a nice view. I've had dinner and breakfast and lunch. Food is not good. I do have one spot of pain deep inside one part of one breast, when I first stir to move. Not sure what it is, but I will find out. Since I do have meds \"on board,\" I'm not sure I should be having that spot of pain. It does diminish once I've walked around for a while. In fact, I've noticed that the more I walk around, the better I feel. I did not sleep well last night and I'm not sure why. The room was quiet and I was not interrupted much. I dozed for 45 minutes and then I'd be up for 45 minutes. Having my phone and iPad (and extra charger) was great. I wasn't uncomfortable, just not particularly sleepy. Maybe because I \"slept\" during surgery? I have hot flashed more than usual in the hospital. It's not hot in here, and maybe it has something to do with the anesthesia or meds? If I'd predicted this, I'd have brought one of my little handheld purse fans. I've woken from surgery every time with a sore throat in the past from the breathing tube - but not this time! I had told the anesthesiologist this, and maybe he did something different? Worth mentioning if this has happened to you. He told me that's just a normal thing to happen and he couldn't make promises, but maybe he was extra cautious since I had mentioned it. My normal throat lozenges that I always bring remain unopened! I have four drains but only one is outputting a lot. The rest are fairly minimal. I know I will go home with two of them. The drains are a pain because you have to remain aware of them or you could accidentally rip them out (since you are numb). So, they can't just hang down untethered. But also, you need to make sure you aren't sitting on them or blocking them.Mine are pinned to my gown. I have a ton of stuffing in front covered by some enormous surgical bra that would never fit me normally without all the cotton stuffing. I can pull it forward and peek in , but it's pretty tight. Not uncomfortable though. If I can think of anything else, I'll post again. Good luck to you all.",
