I started radiation July 5th, so today was Day 15/31 or 33 - my RO has not decided if he will give me 3 or 5 booster treatments. I have to say that so far radiation has been the easiest thing I've had to endure since my diagnosis on April 8, 2011 (obviously I did not have to go through chemo - Thank God!!).  I am in and out of there in 15 minutes flat and I love my Radiation team, I'm trying to think of something to do for them once I am done, because they have made this whole process stress-free for me.  I read a couple of postings of people who've had bad experiences with radiation staff...I had initially gone to another office had my mapping done and everything and cancelled the day of the first scheduled treatment, I just did not feel comfortable with the nurses or male therapists (I don't have a problem with male doctors, but they did not seem at all professional) - not to mention that one of them tried to flirt with me in the parking lot when I came for my first consultation with the RO - he didn't know I was a patient and I did'nt know he was a therapists until my next visit..  So I think it definitely helps to be comfortable with the team.  I would advise anyone to not be afraid to change centers if you can, you don't need the added stress!  Week three (last week) my breast did start to \"tan\" and I am noticing today some dryness in the nipple area.  I also think that I am starting to feel a bit fatigued - my treatments are at 10:45 and I'm dozing at noon, while watching TV. When I was diagnosed, a friend of a friend recommended a product called Alra - she told me that it was very soothing for her skin during radiation.  I ordered this product online - deodorant and lotion, I love the deodorant (so for those who say they have to re-apply during the day, you may want to try this) and the temp was in the 3-digiits here on last week.  I'm thinking I probably need to apply the lotion 4 times a day as my RO ordered, rather than twice a day when I remember to combat the dryness around the nipple. While radiation has been a piece of cake, I am already starting to become concerned about having to take this drug Tamoxifen for the next 5 years... ",

Coraleliz - Thanks!  Exactly, I was so looking forward to it --- however met with my breast surgeon today for a check-up and she said that I was NOT going to like it - she seemed to feel that the Lupron and Tamox were gonna give me serious hot flashes.  This is day 5 for me on Tamoxifen and so far no SEs, she seems to think that they would've kicked in by now and that I should wait and see if the Tamoxifen stops my periods.  So now I'm undecided whether to wait a couple of months or go ahead and try it and if I get unbearable hot flashes from the combination, then stop getting the injections????  I have some time to decide so... Lena - Thanks - like I said I was so looking forward to not having a period.  I have always been the most regular person I know!!!  The only time I didn't have one is when I was pregnant, and I was too sick then to even enjoy it!  Yeah, and I definitely know what you mean about the missing estrogen and the effect it can have on the libido effect !!  I was telling my husband and he was looking at me sideways - LOL!!  Then I was thinking I'm gonna have mood swings, be cranky and then not want to be bothered with my husband - this is gonna be one \"happy\" household - LOL!  Yeah, but with regard to getting old, let's think about it the way my mother always has (she's 81) and has always said \"the only way to not get old is to die - so let's just keep living!!  After getting through this we can do anything!

Thursday made three weeks out of Rads for me and had follow-up appt with Rad Onc, as well as first appt with Med Onc ---- it was also 5 months to the date (April 8th) that I received the call with the results of my biopsy... First had appt. with RO and he said that my skin looked good and that I should continue with the therapy lotion for about three more months that that would help my skin get back to normal sooner.  I only had some minor itching during early Rads, but no peeling just discoloration (light and dark patches).  So I will continue to use the Alra therapy lotion. Just curious as to how many of you received the tattoos on your breast or did you have the semi-permanent markers during Rad treatments? Next, had appt with MO and was already to tell her about my hesitation/resistance to taking the Tamoxifen, the main reason being that I have fibroids and had read that it was common after taking Tamoxifen for 2-3 years that existing fibroids could nearly double in size.  I had the UFE procedure for my fibroids about 11 years ago that worked wonderfully for 8-9 years - the fibroids returned so I had the same procedure last June and the results were not as successful as the first procedure.  A heavier or longer or more bothersome period was just not an option for me, after going through everything else! So wanted to hear her thoughts about that (I switched Oncologists after my lumpectomy so this is my first time seeing her about BC post treatment) - I saw her as a Hematologist a couple of years ago for anemia due to my heavy periods, so we initially talked about a hysterectomy, which I was all for.  As she started looking through my charts, she noted that my recurrence score was pretty low but that she still highly recommended the Tamoxifen because it could do nothing but increase my chances of remaining cancer-free.  She said that there was definitely a possibility of the fibroids growing due to the Tamoxifen.  She then suggested that there was a shot I cold take monthly that would stop my periods!  That she also said could only help, with pretty much same side effects as Tamoxifen, hot flashes (she stated that if the hot flashes are unbearable or I couldn't function - night sweat, no sleep, etc.- she could prescribe something else, but that it would be best to deal with them if you can, so that you're not taking yet another drug.)    I didn't ask her the name of the drug, but I came home and did some research and I'm assuming it's something called Lupron (a drug that basically shuts down the ovaries).  Her office has to confirm  that my insurance will pay (it's supposed to be pretty expensive) and then they will call me to come in and get the shot...  So, definitely interested in it as a short-term fix (I believe that she said I would take it for 2 years), but also open to hysterectomy/oopherectomy if I need to.  Anybody have any personal or second hand experience/knowledge about Lupron??  So, I had the prescription filled and took my first pill that night, so we'll see what happens!  I'm going to NY next month for my birthday and do not want to be feeling lousy, so wanted to go ahead and start taking it so that if I feel sick or have horrible, horrible hot flashes, maybe I can stop a week or so before my trip! Also, I have NEVER had a prescription that was totally FREE!!! I've had some antibiotics from the dentist that were maybe $2 bucks, but never free - wow :-)  I was already trying to figure out what this was gonna cost monthly for 5 years, so that was a nice surprise.

No, unfortunately, I don't think those areas will start to heal when you're getting the boosts.  As a matter of fact, it seems that my armpit and right under my breast have got worse in the past few days (during the boosts).  Though I don't think it's from the boosts -  I think it's just the buildup of the 28 radiation treatments. My armpit is burned, raw looking and pink and is now starting to peel and pieces of skin just randomly fall off.  I have not used the Aquaphor or the Alra Therapy Lotion in the last few days, because I just don't want to touch my skin, after I shower - it looks like an open wound... I was a little uncomfortable yesterday after receiving the last boost - I had some itching right at the incision.  But today I have been fine and I still haven't put anything on it - I'll see what it does/how it heals naturally...  If it seems to be healing slowly, then I'll start applying something to it.  I've never been one to continue taking medicine after I start to feel better, so...LOL! One of the therapist did tell me yesterday that it may get a little worse - she said because although I'm done with treatment, the radiation will still be working for about 1-1/2 to 2 weeks.  Which I was kinda glad to hear, since I will not even see the oncologist to get started on the tamoxifen until three weeks from now. Sounds like you have about 2 more weeks to go - hang in there!  Have a great weekend! Blessings to All!",

Lena - Hopefully, you will not have to experience this - let's keep our fingers crossed! It's actually a bit worse since Friday, I'm still not putting anything on it, because I don't want to put anything in an \"open cut\"  Glad to hear that Pejkug3's skin is healing quickly, hope to follow that same path! Also, since I stopped using the Alra therapy lotion and Aquaphor a few days ago, I was glad to read what Pollyagain's RO said about it not helping one way or the other at this point.  It's only been three days since my last treatment, so I'm believing that by Friday I see some nice improvement in my two \"wounds\"  My son is gone back to school now so I can go topless if that will help!  Didn't stop sleeping in a bra until a week or so ago, that may have not been too smart on my part...but it seemed like it felt better. LindaJanette - Hope your skins feels better.  So glad you got a new Oncologist AND you like him!  I'll be seeing mine Sept. 8th (and I presume starting the Tamoxifen shortly thereafter); however I already know and like her - she's also a Hematologist and I saw her for a little over a year for my anemia. Elizabeth1889 - glad to hear that in spite of your rad team your skin is feeling better and you're almost done!! Janinnj - Glad you are getting to the end of your rads! Susan61- I didn't have chemo, so I have no knowledge of what you're experiencing, however, I personally would be concerned with those types of symptoms.  Is your doctor not concerned about it -- but if it concerns you then I'd seek additional expert advice regarding it. Possibly, there's some information on this website or other related sites ACS, etc.",

Congrats to all of the others who finished up Rads this week as well!! I am a week and two days out of Rads and the one spot where my skin had broken down really bad is almost \"healed\" meaning you can only see a small section of pink flesh...  It was pretty much like my Rad therapists said and most of the ladies on here reported - it got a little worse, before it started to get better! To those still getting daily Rads - hang in there!! Praying for none to minimal SEs for all of us moving on to some type of hormonal therapy. Blessings to All!",

Remembering what my breast looked like at the end of Rads and now almost 4 weeks later, it will stop peeling and be better!! pekjug3 - Me too, I'm gonna need to take something ahead of time.  I was told to schedule one for the lumpectomy breast for October (6mos from diagnostic mamm confirming malignacy).  I am so not looking forward to this - I assume they will be gentle, not like the diagnostic one when they're mashing and smashing like crazy!! Blessings!",
