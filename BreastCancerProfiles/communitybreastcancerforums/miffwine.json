If the information helps anyone sort through the confusion its worth posting. I will summarize for you then you can check this personally if you are interested. The following website created a database of cancer patients pH balance. http://www.alkalizeforhealth.net/salivaphtest.htm. The jist of their effort was to encourage people with cancer of any kind, to test their saliva pH and report back with their results. You may be aware that a neutral ph is just over 7. 1478 people logged in and the results showed that 47% were below 4.5, 27% were between 4.5 - 5.5, and about 16% were 5.5 - 7. A total of 93% or 1378 of the respondents registered a low pH. these numbers are not \"official\" in any way, because everything was submitted on a voluntary basis, but I had never seen these numbers anywhere else and this concept was an eye opener for me. Pursuing the apparent connection between body pH and cancer development has led to other discoveries that you may find helpful. You may be among the 7% who maintain a normal pH, but if not, the question unanswered is whether raising your pH back to neutral would inhibit further cancer development or even reverse what has already been found. Logic indicates that a low saliva pH could also be an advanced warning of increased risk.

The survey I posted strongly supports the article you\u2019ve provided.Your article refers to cancer cells on a slide in a laboratory setting, while the survey is the first I\u2019ve seen that moves this cancer/pH discussion from the laboratory into the lives of real people.Both the article and the survey agree that cancer thrives in an acid environment.Your article goes further to say that the opposite is also true; that cancer cannot survive where the environment is alkaline, whereas the survey does not. Your disagreement with my post is based on your having made two incorrect assumptions. One, that I am referring to changing any pH level in the body by diet, which I am not, and two, that the body pH level that you and the article refer to is the same as the saliva pH level referred to in the survey. It is not, and your article makes no reference to saliva pH at all. In order to understand why I found this survey so significant, you first have to understand the difference between the two. If you feel compelled to disagree, please make sure we are in disagreement over the same things. I encourage you or anyone to post me privately if you would like me to explain.",
