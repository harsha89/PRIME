I was scheduled for a screening mammogram- which I was supposed to start getting last year at 35 due to my paternal grandmother succumbing to breast cancer. At the screening, the lady asked if I had any symptoms and I told her about the drainage. I ended up getting a diagnostic mammogram and a R ultrasound. Both were normal. My Dr referred me to a surgical oncologist. My first visit with him was in late Feb and I got a core needle biopsy that day. Results came back with Atypical hyperplasia. I had an excisional biopsy on March 7th. I have ADH, ALH, calcifications in my ducts, inflammation and milk production. I take Reglan for gastroparesis which causes the milk. I did a genetic test yesterday in the clinic. He wants to know my specific risk. I will go back in 3 months for a diagnostic mammogram and a MRI. I've been trying to connect with people in a similar situation to see if they developed cancer. If so, how long after diagnosis of hyperplasia?",
