      "Content": "Alta0529 wrote: If the lump was not completely removed during lumpectomy and some of it was reduced during Chemo according to the Pet Scan.....Why would they still state the original size if they only received it in slides not as a whole. According to the surgeon the lump is still in and because of calcification will have to do mastectomy. Is this common? One more question ...how do they determine how many lymph nodes to take out? Is there a chance they might have missed some? i hope someone can have an answer. thanks Log in to post a reply",
