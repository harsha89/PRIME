He felt I didn't need the test since my cancer was so small and was trying to convince me it wasn't necessary and may skew my decision. I told him if I'm left to make this decision, I need everything to make the best possible decision for my care. He conceded to talk to \"the experts\". I think with the combination of me getting the complete genetics testing done and discussing my case more in depth with the tumor board they agreed I should have the oncotype test. So now I play the waiting for the results game... ",

All went well except that I'm allergic to any and all types of adhesive tape not only did I made sure they knew before surgery and informed them that tagederm was the only thing I'm not allergic to, they asked me a couple of time and verified that it is in my file. RO assured me he only uses glue and dissolvable stitches which is fine for me. I didn't notice until I was home that I had 2 coverings the top half tagederm and the bottom was a different cotton type bandage. I thought it just dry gauze under a long tagederm. Last night my whole body itched like crazy and I couldn't sleep. I woke up to hives all over my body( it was in groups everywhere from my back to my groin area) which I thought was because of the new sports bra I was wearing but then I noticed redness around the cotton bandage. I had an appt with my PS this morning so I figured I\u2019d just ask him instead of calling the Onco office and having to go in there (the nurses yesterday specifically told me not to touch my bandages even even if I had an allergic reaction and to call my Onco if I had any problems). Luckily, my PS knows about my allergies and saw the hives on my back and redness around the adhesive and offered to remove both the cotton adhesive and the tagederm. When he pulled them off both the Tagaderm area was fine but the cotton bandage area with puffy and red and upon closer inspection there was tiny blisters along the outline of the adhesive. Ugh, it seems like any new person that doesn\u2019t know my file always seem to ignore my NO Adhesive/tape rule. It\u2019s like they think I\u2019m making a big deal out of nothing. Only redeeming thing was when the hospital called to check up on me today, I let them know that they ignored my file of what I\u2019m allergic to and as a result I\u2019m broken out in hives and blisters. Of course they apologized and said they would take note so that nothing like this happens again. hmmm This is what they put on when I got out of surgery. This is how it's now with the adhesive removed notice top area is ok the bottom area where it was touching my skin is red and blistery. :( ok end rant.",

Hugs to all of you too!!!  @Rushell- thank you and I read a little bit of your story too and I'm sorry you also, have to go through a lot of stressful things seemingly all at the same time.   @Carolyn, I will be thinking of you too when you have your biopsy which is actually the same day as my youngest daughter and my mother's birthdays. @Debbi, thank you for your prayers.   One thing for those ladies that are stressing out especially the night before your surgery, one of the things that did help me a lot (I'm one of those that will lay in bed driving myself crazy and not sleep) is my Dr. recommended and gave me a prescription for just 2 pills of Lorazepam. One to take the night before the surgery and one to take the day of.  I should also mention, that if you do take it they recommend that you do not drive yourself home as they equated it to being drunk, it just made me sleepy and calm. If you do get a prescription and do decide to take it the day of your surgery, make sure your surgeon also knows prior to your surgery that you will be taking it.  I have a funny story about my experience with it when I went in for the stereotactic biopsy. So my Dr. prescribed to me the lorazepam to take before the biopsy but forgot to tell me that someone should drive me home if I take it, since the radiologist had told me prior that I could drive myself home I didn't think twice about it and told my fiance to not take time off work. Long story short, they asked me if I had taken anything and I told them I had taken the Lorazepam and they said I shouldn't drive home. The equated it to me like almost driving drunk, I actually only felt sleepy. My fiance works 45 min away and I knew he was in meetings that day and couldn't just up and leave to come get me so I got in my car, locked all the doors and slept it off for almost an hour in the parking lot. I woke up somewhat refreshed and drove home. I'm sure people who parked next to me thought I was a bit crazy looking conked out in my car. hehe Nevertheless, I actually got a refill for 2 more pills so that I can take them again for the surgery on the 4th, but this time I'll have a ride home. :) Thanks again for replying and listening to me.   ",

      "Content": "Mulligan wrote: Hello I am new to this site and thought I'd share my story with you all, I am a 37 yrs old mother of 4 kids, no history of breast cancer in my family. Found bloody nipple discharge in my left nipple back in March wasn't able to see a Dr. until June(no insurance). Got a mammogram, found suspicious microcalcifications only on left breast, with a BiRad 4 and was scheduled for a stereotactic biopsy on June 22nd.  Went in to get the biopsy, the poor gals spent over an hour trying to get the mammogram to focus on the area of concern that they really wanted to biopsy (behind the nipple) but couldn't get close enough to the area so now I've been rescheduled to have a consult with the general surgeon to get a surgical biopsy with wire.  June 27th, I came back from my consult with the surgeon. She was nice and informed me that they will do another mammo on me and put a wire in the area of the califications then she will do the biopsy where the wire is using the area around my aerola to help hide the scar, yay! She also wanted to use a probe where my nipple is bleeding and follow the duct to see if it is in the same area and if not she'll take more biopsy samples. I'm scheduled for the surgery on the 7th of July.  July 2nd, so I go through all the trouble to get insurance and be truthful to my Dr. telling her when I think the issues first started and now the insurance company is denying my surgery saying it's a pre-existing condition since I told the Dr. it happened before I got coverage and since the surgeon wants to also do a nipple exploratory surgery that was the pre-existing condition. I got a letter today saying I'll be eligible for coverage of a pre-existing condition in Feb 2012. Multicare suggested I try for pre-existing insurance coverage (pcia) or for financial aid through Multicare. I call financial aid and they said I have to apply and sent me an application. I called PCIA and they told me since i have insurance (mind you it's a month into it) that I'm not qualified for PCIA. I told them if I knew that the insurance company would deny me and say it's a pre-existing condition I would have just applied with them. She said I know but it's the rules. You can apply in 6 mo after you cancel your insurance. The nurse told me the total cost of the surgery with hospital fees, etc would be a little over $16k. So now I'm living on a prayer that I get approved of the financial aid. What and how much they will cover is whatever they decide to do.  You would think insurance companies would want to be proactive and fix something before it becomes something major, but no. I think they are hedging their bets that people will die before they have to pay out on fixing what is now something major.  July 22nd, my rainbow appears through the crap storm, seems that God or whoever is up there watching over me has answered my prayers, after numerous calls of me checking on the status of my application from Multicare, I received a letter from them that and they approved me of financial aid!!!  I rescheduled to have my surgical biopsy for Aug 4th.  You don't know how much of a stress relief this is for me, although for the past few weeks I was trying to pretend none of this ever happened, that I never found the discharge and that I never went to the Dr.  Now that everything is back on track, one stress down 2 more takes it's place...  I'm trying to stay positive (which is hard for a person like me) and am hoping everything comes back benign and all that time wasted hasn't \"progressed\" anything and that life will seemingly return back to how it once was, but I get the feeling even if things do come back benign, peoples lives are forever affected and changed forever for there will always be something in the back of your mind telling you that you passed the test THIS time, but what about the next one...  I'm glad I found this site as even though I've been calm on the outside, I've been scouring the internet trying to learn as much as I can to prepare myself and it's hard not to be able to talk to anyone else especially when they have no idea what I'm going through. Since I found out, I haven't told anyone except my fiance and my sister(she's watching the little ones while I go in to see the Dr.). Waiting is the worst part. I feel like my life is at a stand still until I get the biopsy and find out the results. Hope everyone has a great weekend, will update with surgery results.

The ladies here are great with lots of tips to help and avoid SE. :) On a rant note about my portacathe yesterday, it all went well except that I'm allergic to any and all types of adhesive tape and I made sure they knew before surgery and informed them that tagederm was the only thing I'm not allergic to, it is also in my file that I'm allergic to all tape. I didn't notice til I got home that I had tagederm and a different cotton type adhesive on. Last night my whole body itched like crazy and I couldn't sleep. I woke up to hives all over my body and redness around the cotton bandage, I seriously thought it was from my new sports bra I was wearing. I had an appt with my PS this morning so I didn't want to bother calling the Onco office(the nurses yesterday specifically told me not to touch my bandages even even if I had an allergic reaction and to call my Onco if I had any problems). Luckily my PS knows about my allergies and saw the hives and redness and offered to remove the dressings and redo everything with tagederm.  When he pulled off both the old Tegaderm and cotton adhesive you could see where the tagederm area was fine but the cotton adhesive material was on my skin was puffy and red and upon closer inspection tiny blisters formed along the outline of where the adhesive was. Ugh, it makes me mad when they don't take me seriously when I say I'm allergic. Ending on a positive note, the nurse called me to check up on me and I let her know how my allergy issue was ignored and now I have hives and blisters. She apologized and promised it would be noted to ensure stuff like this doesn't happen again.",

Put tea tree oil on the day of chemo and the next day. During your chemo treatment soak your toes and fingers in ice. Some, ladies bring ice bags, frozen peas, etc. take a tour of your chemo rooms to get an idea of what is there for you and what you can expect. It was nice to know where the ice machine, snack areas and bathrooms were located before I got there. Good luck! So my 1st treatment went pretty good. I did have 2 bouts of diarrhea when I got home but it may have been party because I've been constipated the past few days from the stress so I took an exlax in the morning in case the meds would make it worse. Only other issues I have is all night and even now my fingers and toes are tingly and numb feeling. I've had poor circulation all my life but I just want to make sure this is normal SE. Anyone else ever had this happen?",

I have mine about the same area. Portacath I have 2 scars from the port surgery. They have youtube videos on the process if you dare check it out. The first scar is up about 4 finger widths above the port scar, I guess that is where they fish the vein for the port and then they made the second larger opening to place the port through. They put bandages on the area and you keep it on until your first session. As long as the scars are closed you don't have to worry too much about caring for it. I had a bit of time with my issues of allergies to tape/adhesive. You can see my pics in my rant thread and see the 2 scars if that gives you an idea. Yours may differ since you said they would be going through your mastectomy scar? Adhesive allergy near port Hope that helps, good luck!",

Today is my day 11 post 1st Chemo and I noticed about 15 min ago I ran my fingers through my hair and lots of strands came out. I repeated the process and still lots of strands are coming out. So I think by day 14 I'll have chunks coming out but I'm taking a proactive stance and decided Thursday will be my day to shave my head. I didn't want to do it tomorrow since I have my followup with my Onco and even though I've prepared myself of my hair falling out, it still is a bit shocking to see no matter how much you prepare. I guess I just want to hang onto 1 more day of \"normal\", with me being bald, the reality will be definite for me, even though I know I have cancer, this will be the proverbial \"reality slap in the face\".  I haven't even tried on my 2 wigs I bought back in July. I think subconsciously it would make everything real. Does that make sense? Good luck everyone!",

My husband can't wait either, since it'll give him an excuse to shave his head. (he likes his head bald just for sheer laziness. I like him with hair on his head), he actually said he would like to see me bald too. What a weirdo. I've always hated and yet proud of my hair too. I hated it because I had lots of hair it was always so heavy, but I was proud of it because I could grow it long quickly. Back in August I decided to go really short (for me) and donate my hair to Locks of Love (how ironic huh), my guy actually says he prefers me with short hair (he's always been into a long hair) so maybe after chemo and when my hair starts growing again, I may keep it short.",

Speedcat and Sjacobs, I finally tried my wigs on this weekend. I think they look more real with a hat on than by itself. I\u2019ve decided to only wear them when I go out. Around the house, I\u2019m just balding it. Most of my hair has fallen off last night. The ones that are still stubborn on my head easily come out when I pull on them. For awhile I was obsessively pulling them out, now I just don\u2019t care. hehe  Here I am being goofy. Welcome cdg, there are a lot of wonderful ladies here that have great tips and tricks to help get through treatment. Good luck! Ugh, even though I\u2019ve been prescribed prednisolone for my rashes my hands still burns, hurt and itch just not as bad. Hoping my next infusion doesn\u2019t continue this. Good luck ladies!",

I just remember waking up and being in so much pain and not being able to talk (because of it being sore from the tube down my throat during surgery) and not being able to move at all my whole left arm was tingly, sore and numb from the lymph node removal and the 1st thing that popped into my head was how can anyone be discharged in a day.

      "Content": "Aug 4, 2011 09:52PM - edited Aug 4, 2011 09:53PM by Mulligan Hi 1flowergirl1, first, welcome to the forum. Second, sorry to hear that you are going through this. This is a great place to find and get emotional and mental support especially when we can't in our daily life. Third, the positive thing is that 80% of microcalcifications found in biopsies turns out to be benign. I know you must feel overwhelmed and stressed especially since you are helping taking care of your mother. Do you have other family members that can help out? Or if you or your family are a part of a church, I'm sure the members are willing to help. People, on the outside, especially when dealing with an illness want to help and are waiting for you to tell them what needs to be done. Take people up on their offers when they tell you if you need help, just let them know. I'm the type who hates to ask for help and think people are just being nice when they say stuff like that, but I've realized they TRULY do want to help. Don't feel guilty to allow others to help you take the burden off of you and your sister. You too, need to stay strong and positive and allowing others to help is a big stress reliever. Sorry for rambling on, vent away here, there are some awesome people here that have great advice, experiences and open arms and ears for you. Hugs (( )) jules",
