Here is some background info about me: 34 years old Missed menstral period for 4 months - Tubaligation done in 2003 after second child. Approximately 7 years ago found lump on right breast, had biopsy and result was benign.  Was told it was more than likely from the underwire bras I wear. Breast/nipple is always itchy for the past 6 months or so Sudden rash -see pics (link below)  www.flickr.com/photos/83890124... (This first pic is from day 2 of the rash)    This pic is day 4 This is from tonight...(the \"hole\" near the center is from me picking at it...I know I shouldn't have, but I am the curious type) Log in to post a reply",
