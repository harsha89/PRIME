I had really bad shoulder blade pain - the kind you get when you've been at your computer too long. I was being treated by an orthopedist, had PT and epidurals for the pain. As it turned out my IDC had invaded the main nerve and blood vessel in my left arm. When I recovered from the mastectomy, the shoulder pain was gone for good. Best wishes to you.",
