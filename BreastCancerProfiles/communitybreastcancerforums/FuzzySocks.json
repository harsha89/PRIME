I was just diagnosed as stage 4 a month ago...prior to that I was trying to be active with the goal of losing weight. now that my pain is under control (thanks radiation!) I want to up my activity again. The problem is I'm actually terrified. I don't know if others feel the same, but with my mets being in my lumbar spine, and me being overweight, i'm scared i will have a compression fracture or something, even though my oncologist said exercise is fine and in fact good. the things i use to enjoy were mostly at home workouts (to fit it in around my kids schedules)...like videos and walking on the treadmill. I guess i just wish i could get over my fear.",

I hadn't even considered that this might be the case, especially since it felt like it was getting smaller...but pathology report was back and still 4 areas of cancer with the largest being 2.5 cm, and 6 out of 16 nodes positive. the margins were clear which is good...but now it's impossible for me to relax as all i can picture is stray cancer cells hanging out in my body. I'm starting radiation next week and then tamoxifen. i was originally stage 2 but i guess this amount of nodes makes me 3 right? I'm so sad. all i want is to be alive for my kiddos :(",

It looks like we were diagnosed almost at the same time! my fateful mammogram was mid to end July 2017 too.",

Olma, was it just through exercise that you were able to lose weight? or dietary changes too? prior to the mets i was able to lose 20lbs, but really still need to lose 50 more. I actually do have some old Leslie Sansone DVD's which i could definitely do. and if i can get over my fear, then i can walk on my treadmill or even outside now that it's finally nice here. time to dust off my fitbit! let me know if i can try and add any of you",
