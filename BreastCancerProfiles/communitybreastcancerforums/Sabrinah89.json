My concern is a new rash that has quickly appeared and spread. It is incredibly itchy. I remember my grandmother complaining about an itchy rash on her breast but I don't remember learning anything else about IBC. Also I developed a strange symptom. My nipple doesn't seem to point out anymore and I have some pain in my left breast. Thank you for any help. I'm sure I'm probably just overreacting and its nothing so I don't want to pay a copay I can't afford to see the doctor. Log in to post a reply",
