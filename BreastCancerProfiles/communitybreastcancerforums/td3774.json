As i layed on the table in the ultrasound the tech couldnt find what to put the needle in called the head of the department and she tells me she cannot find any lump that needs to be removed I am in shock and very upset she is surprised i am not relived but i felt more concerned i guess that i still have this 1mm lump that they had said now i dont need out only a few weeks ago they said yes it needed to come out is this normal i am 33 no children no previos family history of breast cancer but evey other cancer is in my family should i get some other person to do my ultrasound?
