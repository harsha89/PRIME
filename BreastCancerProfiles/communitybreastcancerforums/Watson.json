RAD001 is an oral kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks the mTOR protein. By inhibiting cell proliferation, cellular bioenergetics, and angiogenesis, RAD001 may provide clinical benefit to patients with cancer. RAD001 may have antiangiogenic activity due to inhibition of tumoral VEGF production and inhibition of pericyte and endothelial cell proliferation. RAD001 is now being investigated in Phase I to III clinical trials in multiple tumor types, including neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. ",

I had a CT scan that showed 6 spots but since all my bloodwork and tumor markers were good, my oncologist asked for a biopsy.  In my case, it was lung mets.  I'm still feeling okay and I start a different chemo in two weeks. The biopsy was CT guided.  They gave me woozy meds.  You basically lay still and the machine slides you in and out and they do several needle sticks.  While not fun, it wasn't as bad as I thought. I hope it's nothing in your case.  If it is mets, just know that we're here for you. Watson",

I have a call into my oncologist to see how realistic this is.  My counts are going in the wrong direction!  For those of you who have had the low count issue, how low did yours ever get?  I know I've heard of others being hospitalized due to low white counts.  For now the nurse just told me to avoid sick people.  That I can do!

Hello, I was originally dx'd in May 2005 with presumably triple neg bc.   I was dx with lung mets early this year.  My onc at the time did not think it necessary to test my lung mets for her2.   I finally switched to MD Anderson and the first thing my current onc said was that it was imperitive to test. He retested my lung met AND my old breast tumor from 2005.  And guess what, since the beginning I have been slightly her2 pos.  I'm not sure what they measure, but something about how the cutoff for being positive is 2.2 and I'm 2.3.  He also said that the positiveness (such a word?) was found on the inside of the cell, not the outside and since Herceptin works by binding to the outside not sure how this will work but he has added Herceptin to my current Gemzar chemo.  (Gemzar is working quite well by the way) So I guess what I'm asking is if anyone else has had a low positive Her2 and if Herceptin worked?

He is on top of things!  He's the one that retested all my past tumor stuff and found out that i was her2 pos.  He doesn't let things slip past. His nurses don't call back.  They've returned an email or two.   When I was in a trial, the trial nurse answered her cell all the time.  Not so much with his regular nurses.  He has a seperate scheduling assistant and I can get through to her easily as well.   This is going to sound unbelievable but I email or text my onc's cell phone and he gets back right away.  He even answered his cell the one time that I called. And on top of all this, my oncologist is a very compassionate man.  Not to be a downer but I know that one day this man is going to look me in the eye and tell me there is no more that can be done.  With his competence and compassion, I wouldn't want anyone else to deliver that news.

      "Content": "Watson wrote: Hello fellow metsters and concerned others, I was dx with mets just under a month ago.  I can honestly say I don't think I felt any pain, SOB, etc.  That is until a few days ago.  I am on my off week from Xeloda. I am having a dull ache/pain in spots on my back.  It feels like someone is poking me with a broom handle.  (not that I ever remember being poked with a broom handle, but was watching husband do yard work yesterday and came up with that analogy)  It doesn't get worse if I breathe in heavy or exhale. And while my breathing is still clear and no SOB, I am having a little cough about 5 to 10 times a day.  No big deal, but it is there.  It may have been that way even before dx.  My voice sounds like I have a slight congestion but again no problem with breathing or inhaling/exhaling.  It's just worrisome that I'm getting these issues while on Xeloda.  You'd think any symptoms would be getting better, not beginning! I have an appt with onc tomorrow for bloodwork, yada yada so of course I will mention this newest development.  But why wait to talk to a professional when I can whine and obsess with the people that  REALLY know what's going on? And by the way,  I had someone ask me if chatting with \"internet people\" was my new thing.  I told her yes it was.  I was starting off with women w/ breast cancer and was going to work myself up to men with Ferrari's! Any thoughts?  (About the lung problems, not the men w/ Ferrari's!) Love, Watson I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints. - Billy Joel Dx 1/29/2008, Stage IV, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Last week's chemo really kicked my butt.  I was achy, fatigued, feverish, had GREEN poop, really dark pee and diaper rash!  Well I had scans today and they said my liver enzymes are high.  Onc looked at my scan online and said it looked okay (still waiting on radiologist to give it thumbs up) He thinks it's the Gemzar that is messing with my liver.  I will have everything retested on Tuesday and go from there. The nurse that called me told me to hold off on any Tylenol or alcohol.  I told her I haven't had a cocktail in two weeks and maybe that's why my liver is rebelling.   She didn't agree.  Go figure. Anyone else have this phenomenon?   Oncologist said 12% of patients have this.   Geesh, I need to go to Vegas with those odds. Watson!

Everolimus Blocking mTOR - a central regulator of cancer-cell growth and metabolism The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular protein that acts as a central regulator of multiple signaling pathways (IGF, EGF, PDGF, VEGF, amino acids) that mediate abnormal growth, proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis in cancer. mTOR is a critical component of the PI3K/AKT pathway, a key signaling pathway that is frequently dysregulated in many cancers. RAD001 is an oral kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks the mTOR protein. By inhibiting cell proliferation, cellular bioenergetics, and angiogenesis, RAD001 may provide clinical benefit to patients with cancer. RAD001 may have antiangiogenic activity due to inhibition of tumoral VEGF production and inhibition of pericyte and endothelial cell proliferation. RAD001 is now being investigated in Phase I to III clinical trials in multiple tumor types, including neuroendocrine tumors, renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal, lung, and breast cancers.
