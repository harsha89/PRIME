Just saying -- stuff sometimes gets misplaced and won't be found until an outside force comes in to play. I hope your results are benign. Jen",

Don't think that BMX = no rads.  That is not always the case, but they won't know until after they do the pathology reports. If you choose to do immediate recon (Tissue Expanders), then they may expand you quickly so that you are fully expanded for chemo.  I think you would be sick enough and don't need the add'l pain and inconvenience of getting fills at the same time as chemo. This is a very difficult decision.  Ultimately it is yours to make.  Walk your husband through your thought process and he may feel better about your choice.   The BMX with TEs surgery was the most painful thing I have ever endured.  I still take pain meds every day and CANNOT WAIT until I get these horrible TEs out next month.  That said, I would do it again.  I don't ever want to go through the surgery, chemo or rads again. Good luck in your journey. Jen",

I have always wished I had someone to take me by the hand and point out different plants and tell me their uses.  Sort of like Native Americans did with their kids.  The few things I know about natural cures I learned from being a mom and my training as a lactation specialist.  I know about Arnica for swelling and bumps and bruises, Fenugreek to increase milk production, celery juice as a diuretic.  But those are things I buy (or would buy -- I will never need Fenugreek again!) already processed at the health food store.  I don't have a lawn, so don't have dandelion, but I wouldn't even know which part of the plant to use -- flowers? leaves? stems?   When you make your teas, do you just boil the herbs and then strain, or do you have one of those silk bags like a tea bag to hold the herbs, or what? I finished chemo today!  I will write again tomorrow to tell you about THAT party.  I know you are all on the edge of your seats  I will tell you that at the very end I was given a Certificate of Achievement \"for having successfully completed a course of chemotherapy\".  It was signed by all the nurses and my doctor.  At the bottom it said Congratulations for Having the Courage and Committment to Perservere.  That message brought a tear to my eye. Hugs to all. Jen",

So the weekend was pretty good, but then I found out my next door neighbor who did chemo exactly 1 yr ago for pancreatic cancer just found out it has metatastisized.  She is doing another round of chemo, which is basically her last hope.  She is about my age with a teenaged son.  I know pancreatic is way worse than BC, but then there is the woman who lives up the street who went through chemo for BC a couple of years ago.  She just found out it came back in her spine.  Now on oral chemo for life.  Then there is the woman down the street who died from pancreatic cancer about 2 years ago.  A little farther down the street is an older woman now going through chemo for BC.  I live in Marin County which has the highest rate of BC in the country and no one can figure out why. I know that we caught mine early, but just as I knew it was cancer when they did the needle biopsy, I know that some day this disease will come back and probably be the cause of my death.  I can't help it.  I just feel it deeply in my soul.  That is why I am doing all the treatments I can now.  I had a double mastectomy even though only one breast had cancer.  My OncoType DX was borderline on whether chemo would be beneficial, but I did the chemo.  I'm going to do rads even though I was told I wouldn't have to if I had mx (it ended up that the tumors were so close to the skin that the margins were too small to be considered safe, so rads it is).  I have these f***ing tissue expanders in my chest that feel like an iron bra and are a constant reminder that I have cancer.  And I think chemo affected whatever switch I used to have that told me I was full and to stop eating.  Even though I am not on any meds per se (just pepcid, and sometimes ativan) I feel like I am constantly hungry.  I am getting fat.  I look in the mirror and I see way too much of my father's face.  Bald and with jowels.  Not good. So there you have it.  Ups and downs.  Ups are very high and downs are quite low.  Sorry to dump on you guys, but I had to get it out and I know you will understand. Jen",

Day -- On Friday morning I will look at the sky, smile and say \"Angels on your body, Day.  Angels on your body\".  I had all my friends and relatives do that for me on the day of my surgery and everything went well.  For those of you suffering from neuropathy and/or chemo brain, I'll throw this out there again.  My onc offered to put me on a clinical trial of Acetyl-L-Carnitine to see if it would help deter the development of neuropathy.  I chose not to do the clinical trial but instead bought the stuff myself (health food store, or cheaper on the internet) and took it (almost) every day during my chemo (I had 4 rounds of TC).  I don't know if it was the Carnitine or not, but I got no neuropathy and no chemo brain.  At one point during my treatment I stopped taking it for about 3 days and found myself wandering around asking,\"What the heck was I just doing? Oh, that's right, steaming carrots.  I guess I need a pot.  Why did I get this pot?  Oh, that's right, steaming carrots.\" etc., etc.  Then I got back on the Carnitine and that fog went away.  I started school again yesterday.  I had started classes back in January to begin the process to become a court reporter.  Then I was diagnosed and that threw a monkey wrench into the whole thing.  So I withdrew from my classes in March and am just now going back.  I will only take 4.5 units, because that's all I can handle right now.  The class I took yesterday was with one of my favorite teachers and I was so glad to be back in his class.  His wife was diagnosed w/BC when she was 47 (my age) and she had a mx and went through chemo.  She is now 70 years old and has had no cancer since!  As it turned out she volunteers in the surgical waiting room where I got my surgery, so I got to meet her the day of my mx.  Small world. Anyway, yesterday I took the girls to camp, went grocery shopping, came home for lunch, went to school for 3 hours and came home so tired I went to bed before my kids.  7:30 and I was out.  Thank goodness for my DH who cooked and took kid duty.  I hope my energy comes back soon. I am 5 weeks past my final TC! Big news -- this weekend is my Casting for Recovery trip.  It seems I am always the Field Trip Coordinator (I have done this job for both of my twins' classes for the past 3 years).  I am driving 4 other participants up to the retreat -- about a 5 hour drive.  I am so excited about this trip.  I hope I have the energy to fully enjoy it.  I really hope I see another bald woman this weekend.  Can you believe that I have not seen one bald woman the whole time I have been walking around bald?  We're talking 3 months and no other baldies (except the photos of you lovely ladies)!  I have had a few women come up to me and say they had my same hairstyle last year.  But, come on now,  I can't be the only one to bare it all around here. Anyway, I need to go get the oil changed in the van to prepare.  Oh yeah, I gotta get all the kid crumbs and cr*p out of there too. Jen",

About 3 weeks ago I decided I was going to drastically change my hair in anticipation of chemo.  I had long, red hair (to about bra strap length).  My friend's hair dresser gave me the cutest little Peter Pan Pixie cut -- for free.  Short, short, short and I went blonde, blonde, blonde.  I thought I might as well cut my hair and donate it so someone could get some use out of it.  I also figured I might never be brave enough to go blonde.  My change in hair gave me such a lift.  I love it.  Also, my husband has always preferred me in short hair.  I have already decided that when my hair starts falling out I will have the same hair dresser shave my head.  My girls (7 1/2 yr old twins) told me yesterday they can't wait to have my hair fall out because it will be easier to give me \"noogies\".  Although I did have to promise one of my girls that I would not show up at school bald.  To that end, I went to our local American Cancer Society with a couple of girlfriends and tried on wigs.  We had a blast.  Of course we took photos for my blog so everyone else could enjoy the silliness.  So we found one that was quite similar to my \"old\" hair and it was given to me for free by the ACS. Like some other women here, I am more concerned about losing my brows than losing my hair.  I have seen pictures of women with no hair, both with and without their eyebrows.  The ones without the eyebrows definitely look \"sick\".  So 2 things I am doing: 1) strapping ice packs to my forehead during chemo (sort of my own \"cold cap\" therapy for brows; 2) I went to a website called chemochicks.com and purchased these eyebrow guides and a waterproof brow make-up to help me apply my brows if my ice packs don't work. OK, enough for now.  Hey, JennyB, please keep us posted on the hair. Jen",

Nanaof2, I don't know how you do it.  Being a teacher and going through this and not missing any work.  Are you taking Neulasta shots?  You are in a germ factory every day, so I really hope this one night is your only night in the hospital. To all the women who are going to work during chemo -- my hat is off to you.  I am a stay at home mom and was a full time student before diagnosis.  I cannot imagine trying to work through all this. Along those same lines, ClaudetteK, you probably have a harder job than most.  Especially with the 2 youngest ones it is very hard to explain why mommy can't pick them up or carry them around like she always does.  Don't be too hard on yourself about the daycare.  It's only for a few months and you do what you need to to get through.  You can find other ways to be with them.  I like to bring my girls to bed and play Black Jack (21) with them.  It's a fun way to be together, they might earn a few cents and they are doing math for 30-45 minutes and don't realize it.  CTherese, I was told not to take Ibuprofen while on chemo.  Did your onc say it was OK?  Also, if you feel like curling up and going to sleep -- then DO it.  Cut yourself a little slack.  Naps are good! JulieBed, Don't run because it will follow you.  You know you are strong enough to beat this, otherwise why would you have searched and found this message board?  This is not easy.  No one said it will be easy, but it is worth the fight!  Also, don't fear the Neulasta.  I was afraid of the body aches that some say come with it, but having seen what happens to me without the shots I will take a little achiness.  I insisted that the hospital give me Clariten to help fight the aches even though none of the doctors or nurses had heard of it.  The aches are manageable with pain meds. GolferGirl, OK getting your period back years later -- that just sucks.  I am 47 and ready to be done with it.  I won't be getting an IUD because I tried one a couple of years back and got an infection.  So asuming I should ever feel like having sex again, we will stick to condoms. Countryfrau, I really don't want a port so I am hoping my veins in my upper arm hold out.  I have had enough pain in my chest area with the BiLateral MX, insertion of tissue expanders and quick inflation to full size to last me a life time.  At this point I don't even want them to make a small cut in that area. Fotopet -- I never thought I would be congratulating anyone on being able to start chemo, but Congratulations.  I know this is a huge relief. So I am on day 12 and have not lost any hair so far.  But I don't wash my hair very often.  Once every 3 days or so.  It is very short so I just wet it and finger style it.  Also, my nephew is an ER doc and he told me he just treated a woman very close to my situation (close in age, same DX, same surgeries, same chemo TX).  She had just finished her last TC and she still had her eyebrows.  I know they are the last to go, but maybe there is hope!

Yesterday was TC#2.  Unfortunately I had to go alone because one of my twins woke up in the middle of the night with a fever and DH had to stay home with her.  I was feeling a little bummed until one of my friends showed up at my treatment unexpectedly.  Some of you may remember that my first treatment was on 5/5 and I dubbed it \"Chemo de Mayo\" and brought non-alcoholic margaritas for the staff.  Well yesterday I had planned to do a \"Finding Chemo\" (based on Finding Nemo) theme.  I just didn't have the energy to make cupcakes like I had planned.  So my dear friend Jenny showed up with a cake made of cupcakes with Nemo and Dori on it that said \"Finding Chemo\" and a giant stuffed Nemo and a bunch of little plastic fish and bubbles.  Basically a party in a bag.  The staff loved it.  Now I am on the hook to think of 2 more good themes for my next 2 treatments.  Any ideas? I did have a reaction to the Taxotere this time.  I leaned over to pick something up and suddenly got nauseous, face flushed, shortness of breath.  They immediately stopped the Taxotere, gave me more steriods IV and an Ativan by mouth.  The discomfort only lasted a couple of minutes and they were all on top of it.  The pharmacist even brought in a whole slew of vials of meds I might need and said \"Every time I bring these magic meds in the room, patients get instantly better and don't need them.\"  It was true. So they waited a half an hour and restarted the Taxotere at a slower drip, increasing gradually.  All was fine. I did use my home made ice packs on my eyebrows before and during the Taxotere in the hopes of keeping my brows.  We'll see. Hair update -- I got my buzz cut last Friday and by Wednesday night I was so patchy with bald spots I could not stand it.  So last night I used my dog clippers and my razor and did the best I could.  There were still some hairs I could not get, so this morning I went to a local barber shop and had him give me the \"mr. clean\" look.  The sweet man did it free of charge. So now I am walking around totally bald and out there.  I have started applying a little eye make up and found a couple pairs of my grandmother's clip on earrings.  I wear a long scarf around my neck to warm me up. I did try to wear my wig last week.  I picked up the kids from school in the wig then took them to the library where I started having hot flashes.  I was so hot I took off the wig.  How odd it was to be carrying around a wig.  So I just stuck it under my jacket! Ah, how life changes. Jen",

It was not cheap, (around $40 for 90 pills at my local health food store), but it is available online -- even through Amazon.  I am using a brand called \"Now\" though many are available. Take it for what it's worth.  Don't know if this is why my head is relatively clear, but I thought I would put it out there. Jen",

Here is what I learned from being in the hospital this weekend.  Your WBC count of 2.4 is really 2,400 and the part of that which is really important is the count of your neutropils.  Apparently there are several kinds of WBC, but the neutropils are what really matter here.  Normally your neutropils make up about 50-60% of your WBC, but in my case it was much lower.  I had a 1.4 WBC count with only something like 5% neutropils, so that's why they admitted me. Can you contact your onc and find out your neutropil level?  They told me that if you are under 500 they admit you to the hospital. I don't know what level you have to be at in order to get the shots.  Another thing to know is that I had my first Neulasta shot in the hospital on what was technically day 10 after my treatment (I say \"technically\" because it was at 3:30 in the morning).  My second shot was on day 11 -- by day 12 my counts were back to pre-chemo levels.  How many days out are you? Everyone hits their nadir at different times. Also, about insurance.  I have heard that depending on your coverage you may have to go in to the doctor's office for shots (billed much cheaper?) or you may be given shots to take home and administer to yourself (more expensive for some reason).  Anyway, not sure on the difference in billing reasoning, but this is supposed to be a very expensive drug.  Check with your insurance company and/or doctor's office about the coverage and which way works better before you go down a path that will cost you a lot more money. My final words of advice are if you get a fever of greater than 101 -- go to the ER.  I know you are taking this seriously, but with your tooth infection on top of low counts you need to be on top of this.  It is better to err on the side of caution. I hope this info helps and I hope this resolves to your satisfaction. Jen",

The dermatologist basically told me to take as much Atarax (rx antihistamine) as I needed to get the hives under control and to just be careful of sleepiness.  Apparently they don't take hives too seriously until you have suffered for more than six weeks. As for the chest/throat/mouth pain I believe it is due to the huge amount of reflux I have been suffering.  My onc now has me taking Prilosec 2 times per day (double the recommended) and I am chewing Tums on a regular basis.  Also using the 1/2 and 1/2 mixture recommened here of liquid Benedryl and Malox.  I swish with that and slowly swallow it then don't eat or drink anything for a little while afterward.  I am also doing my best to stay sitting up for a period of time after eating rather than reclining.  These steps seem to help over the past couple of days. FYI, I did go to the allergist and have them specifically test me for allergic reaction to Taxotere and Neupogen.  Neither drug gave me reactions (even though my 2nd TC had caused a reaction because they were infusing too fast.).  They also tested for food, plant, dust mite, dairy, pet dander, etc. when they drew my blood -- and again found nothing.  So I guess the hives is just my body's way of saying \"WTF?\" I hope you find relief soon.

There are women who have been given the shots to take home.  When I was in the hospital over the weekend (due to low WBC because they did not originally give me Neupogen) my oncologist told me that I will be getting it going forward.  She said we will check my insurance coverage to see if I can get syringes to take home so I don't have to schlep to the office for shots.  Apparently it is cheaper for the doctor's office to administer it.  Check with her oncologist and her insurance carrier to see if you can change how she gets her shots going forward. Also, The American Cancer Society has a program called \"Road to Recovery\" which provides rides to and from treatments.  Another thing this program does is help by reimbursing you for mileage and/or giving you a gas card to help out.  When I start my rads I will definitely check this out because I will be driving an hour each way each day.

My onco pharmacist said they really don't want to switch me off of Taxotere because it is the best for my condition.  Maybe you should talk to your onco about getting allergy tested. On another note, I have been so tired and in desparate need of excercise.  I am by nature a sloth.  It doesn't help that to take a walk these days I have to get in my car and drive to somewhere flat.  We live on a STEEP hill (16% grade) and just walking up that hill does me in.  So this morning I did that excercise routine for senior citizens that airs on PBS called Sit and Be Fit.  It is a really gentle 25 minutes of stretching and breathing and bending.  Even so I broke a little sweat!  HA, good for me, I say.  I can boogie with the best of the geriatric set.  Every little bit helps. My girls graduated from 2nd grade yesterday.  Holy cow, where does the time go?  My DH is taking them up to Lake Tahoe for a few days starting on Sunday.  I have to stay home for more allergy appts. so I'm having my mom over for a slumber party one night to watch a movie and then hours of crappy (guilt-free) reality TV.

The tx almost did not happen because my nurse blew out my vein in my elbow of my good arm.  Since I had had nodes removed on the left side we were not supposed to use that side.  So the nurse went to get another nurse.  When she realized what the first nurse had done she said that Taxotere is an irritant and could leak into my arm.  She told Lydia to stop making cocktails because we might need to postpone.  That is when I told her I didn't care if she had to insert the needle in my ankle -- we were doing this last tx that day!  So the 2nd nurse went to speak with my onc and got permission to use my left arm.  Just have to watch for lymphedema in that arm.  I did have a little swelling when I got home and had to use soap to get off my wedding rings, but nothing too bad. So other than that the tx was uneventful except at the end when I was all done and sat there for 5 minutes waiting for my nurse to remove the needle.  So I flagged down another nurse and said, \"I am DONE with chemo, can you please get this needle out of me?\"  That is the second picture you see here.  Along with my Certificate of Achievement and a few tears in my eyes. I have contacted my rads doctor and told him I need a full six weeks to recover from chemo before I start the next phase of treatment.  He didn't seem to have a problem with that.  I will be shooting for start date of 8/24, the day my kids start 3rd grade.  The thing I am dreading the most is making the 2 1/2 - 3 hour round trip every day.  I think I am more stressed about the traffic than the treatment.  Oh, by the way, I used my ice packs on my eyebrows and eyes again yesterday.  I think these have helped.  I used them every session from about 15 minutes before Taxotere and through the taxotere drip.  So far no loss of brows or lashes evident. Still have a few tough chin hairs hanging in there though. So I don't really consider myself Done With Chemo, because I know I have another month or so of SEs to deal with.  I have no more tx's, but I am not done.  I have a follow up appt. with my onc in a month to see how I am doing. Cheers Ladies,  I will be sticking around.   No matter how far along in your treatment you are: \"Congratulations for having the courage and commitment to persevere.\" Jen    ",

X-Ray and Summer -- it looks like we 3 are the ones with the TE and rads combo.  I will probably be starting my rads the week of 8/23, so I'll be first.  I had some pretty big concerns about having rads w/TE.  I don't know if I would have chosen TE if I knew I would need rads.  So it turns out that my rads onc is the head of the dept but when I asked if he had ever radiated a woman with TE he tried to dance around by saying it was a situation \"we try to avoid\".  OK, buster, it's a Yes or No question.  I asked again and he finally admitted that he had no experience with this situation.  So I asked him to call my PS and discuss my TE, at least become familiar with the product and check with the manufacturer about radiating it (he did call my PS but I don't know if he contacted the manufacturer).  Basically the Rads Onc said he wouldn't do anything differently even though there was a metal port in the expander.  I really didn't like this answer so I had the Breast Cancer Social Worker for Kaiser look into it and she called the head of Rads in another area and he concurred that they wouldn't do anything differently.  Of course I wanted one more expert to answer the question so when I went before an outside tumor board for my second opinion (after mx, but before chemo) and that Rads Onc said the same thing -- she wouldn't do anything differently either.  The only other thing is that everyone said it was best to be fully inflated first.  Is anyone else out there going to refuse tattoos for their rads?  I have creamy white skin on my chest and have enough scars from this whole thing so that I don't want to have the tattoos.  I mentioned this to the person who scheduled my CT and rads set up appt. and she said, \"I'll discuss it with the doctor\".  If they give me any flak about it I will just tell them that I plan to be buried in a Jewish Cemetery and it is not allowed to have tattoos.  So if any of you women have or are refusing tats, please let me know how that goes. My DH leaves tomorrow for 8 days.  UGH! Jen",

And the participants were not allowed to bus their dishes -- the volunteers took care of that.  At every meal we had a gift waiting on our plate: a new hat, a box of flies, etc.  But the most amazing part was the genuine caring and love I felt from all these women -- both participants and volunteers alike.  Most of the volunteers are survivors and of all the participants I was definitely the \"baby\" since I am still going through treatment.  Many had been cancer free for 10 or more years.  Sad to say I did not see any other baldies at the retreat.  Oh well. Saturday was spent learning about the equipment, learning to cast out on the lawn (2 one-hour sessions broken up by other things) and learning to tie knots.  Over the weekend there were a couple of sessions where we could just talk about our cancer and ask questions of everyone including a couple of professionals (an oncology nurse and a psychologist).  There were a lot of tears and much laughter. Sunday was our day to fish.  A group of fly fishermen (our \"river helpers\") arrived from all over the state just to be our one-on-one guides and support crew.  Mine was a wonderful man named John who must have stood 6'8\" and was the kindest helper I could have asked for.  He had a wading stick to help me walk through the current and never let go of my arm until we were at a comfortable spot in the middle of the river.  He tied my flies on and helped me with my casting -- and never laughed at my amateurish attempts.  He so very much wanted me to catch a fish!  I was going to be happy just having the experience, but I did get several nibbles and actually \"landed\" a beautiful little rainbow trout (and I do mean little -- it couldn't have been more than 6\" long).  You should have seen the sight of this great big man with a great big net holding my tiny little fish!  Priceless. John's wife came along and sat on the bank and photographed the entire group and got some lovely pictures.  This was John's first time as a River Helper and as we were walking back to the car I asked if he would do it again.  His answer was a resounding, \"Absolutely\".  It still amazes me that these guys drove for hours to teach the art of fly fishing to total strangers (and some of us are stranger than others --  I know you know who I mean).  Some of them do it year after year. At our \"closing ceremonies\" a senior volunteer who has been fly fishing for decades brought one of her personal rods and reels to give as a gift to one of the participants -- and it was my name that was drawn out of the hat!  So now I have no choice but to become a great fisherwoman. All in all it was a fabulous experience.  I would not trade it for anything and may very well end up volunteering myself so I can go on this retreat again. Jen",

Denise - my rads area covered from the top of my left breast to just underneath it, then from the mid-line to under my arm toward my back.  Your fields may be different.  It all depends on where your tumor was.  I had 2 tumors that were located near my cleavage on my left breast.  The next time you see your rads onc ask to see your treatment plan.  They will show you the pictures, scans and simulated treatment fields.  Make sure to ask if they will be treating any of your heart, lungs or esophagus.  They told me they were only treating 7% of my lungs, but that really meant 15% of just my left lung -- quite a difference. I don't remember who asked about sleeping pills, but I take something almost every night to help me sleep.  Ambien doesn't work any more so I kind of rotate between Benedryl, Ativan, Melatonin.  Whatever works. Daiva - I can't imagine how painful a rotated TE is.  I am so sorry you are dealing with that.  As if TEs aren't painful enough.  I'm going to get BRCA tested soon too.  No one even offered until I went for my Pap and my OB/GYN suggested it.  I will do my genetic counseling online and then get the test.  I have daughters too and don't know what I will do if I am positive.  I guess I will cross that bridge when I come to it. So right now I am just giving myself permission to nap.  I come home after dropping the girls at the bus stop and I climb back in bed.  The rads onc said the rads burn should clear up within a couple of weeks but the fatigue may take up to two months.  Great. nighty night.

I am curious if your PS and rads onc are planning to have you fully inflated before you start your rads.  That's the way my PS wanted it -- definitely no fills once rads started.  She was also happy to have the opportunity to remove any scar tissue caused by rads later when she does my exchange. For those of you in rads, I used Emu Oil (purchased from Amazon) during my whole treatment and got no burn until the last week.  Even then it was under my arm where I have no nerves, so not a big deal.  And I am lilly white. I started Tamoxifen about 10 days ago and no new side effects.  Still get the hot flashes, but not as bad as during chemo.  I finished rads about 3 weeks ago and gave myself 2 weeks of luxury by coming home and napping after dropping the girls at school.  Unfortunately though, reality has reared it's ugly head.  We have the girls' Cross Country season which ended today; Brownie trip to the stables tomorrow; showing of \"It's a Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" on Thursday night for Emma's class -- NO siblings allowed; Friday is costumes and parties at their school; plus I have my English classes at the college on both Thursday and Friday.  And then we mustn't forget Trick or Treating on Sunday.  Oh, and my niece had her baby so I am trying to finish up a quilt I have made for her.  Sheesh, I'm tired just writing all this out!  For those of you with kids who are grown and out -- do you miss these chaotic days?

Leanna, after I finished with my rads the only thing they scheduled me for was a f/u visit w/my onc 3 mos later.  No tests at all.  I couldn't believe it.  So I went to see her and that is when she felt a very small \"suspicious\" node in my neck.  That generated a request for MRI which I have to wait until after my exchange surgery to have (metal in the tissue expanders).  Anyway, if she hadn't felt that node she wouldn't have done ANY f/u testing.  I have never had any kind of tumor marker testing.  I did get a bunch of standard blood work and an EKG done yesterday in prep for my exchange surgery.  It is a very tough decision on whether to have a prophy mx.  When they found my 2 tumors and told me that a lumpectomy would take about 25% of my tiny breast, I decided that I would have a double mx.  For 2 reasons -- one: I don't ever want to go through this again; two: symmetry was very important to me.   I hope your PS can convince your other drs to  come up with reasonable tests for you. Jersey, you should send a private message to TimTam on this site and ask her permission to have access to the picture forum (totally different site from BCO).  Many women have posted pics of their reconstructive journeys, including nipple recons.  Apparently there are a few different procedures to make nipples and I assume they produce different results.  I do know that the nipples tend to shrink after a while.  Also, if you look at some of the \"before\" pics on Vinnie's site you can see some reconstructed nipples.   Jen",

I have lost 33 pounds since January.  I have finally broken the 170 barrier -- haven't been in the 160's in over 15 years. Still learning tons in my court reporting classes.  It's really tough! Summer, I am so sorry about your mom.  This disease sucks!  I am firmly in menopause -- since chemo slammed me in there.  I am on low doses of 2 anti-depressants (effexor for hot flashes and trazadone to help me sleep).  Even though they are low doses, I think they help my disposition.  Although, I am trying to ween myself off because both have the side effects of inhibiting libido and lowering the ability to acheive orgasm (TMI?).  Anyway, you should talk with your doctor. Kisses and big hugs to all of you lovely ladies. Nana and Kim -- yay for more babies!!  Love those tiny baby feet.  Just want to kiss them. TTFN, Jennifer",

I went for my CT and Rads set up today.  I told them no tattoos and they told me it only looks like when you get a pencil lead stuck under your skin --\"just a black dot and probably the only one you would see is the one in your cleavage\".  I told them that I just got this beautiful, milky white cleavage and I didn't want a black dot there.  I just started wearing low cut blouses!  At one point pulled the Jewish cemetery card.  They didn't push, but said if my marks came off they would need to do another CT to re-do them.  At this point I don't care how many CTs they need to do. So I ended up with 4 big, black, sharpie marker Xs covered by clear round stickers that I have to keep intact until the end of the month when they start my treatment. Then they can re-mark them and I'll do my best to keep them intact. I feel so badly for those of you still going through chemo treatments and suffering the stinking SE.  This really sucks and I am sorry. Hang in there and pamper yourself whenever you need to. Jen",

My DH left for a month long business trip on Sunday.  By the time he gets home I will be done with rads and have way more hair.  I also hope to be a little thinner.  The weekly weigh-in at rads just about killed me last week when I saw that I had gained 4 pounds in a week and was up to 196!!!  OMG -- that's way too close to 200!  So for the past week I have really been watching what I eat and have been substituting apples or apples w/peanut butter for 2 meals per day.  Today I was back down by those 4 pounds, but I need to get a lot more of this weight off. My SIL has flown out here from Boston for a week to help me with the kids (8 year old twin girls) while DH is away.  Also, I asked friends for help with dinners and I have meals being delivered 2-3 times per week for the next month!  Now if I can just find someone to help me walk the dog I'll be great. I am sending healing vibes and wishes for good dreams to all my May Sisters. Jen",

It is a huge step to be done with chemo and many of us have been quite emotional after finishing.  For me, I didn't really feel like I was done because I still had to do rads but I would break down crying for no reason.  It's like a huge weight off your, shall I say, chest.  I hope your mammo and echo show little to no tumors.  It's funny that your dx (at the bottom of your posts) is very similar to mine, but they chose to cut first and then chemo for me and the other way around for you.  I wonder if the protocol in CR is different than the US. Denise -- I believe Leanna had a right mastectomy with a tissue expander placed at the time of surgery (TE) which gets filled by syringe with saline.  They do it in stages and it can be painful if they do it quickly as they did on mine (100 ccs per week x3).  As for rads pain, I couldn't tell you if I had more than my usual amount of pain since I have pain every day with these TEs.  They feel like having tennis balls under my skin.  Some women refer to them as the \"iron bra\".  So there may have been a little extra pain but I am not sure.  I didn't notice any contracture on the radiated side, but when I went to my PS the day after I finished rads she felt both sides and said there was swelling and scar tissue on the left side (rads side).  Then for the next few days I had some numbness in my fingers radiating down my left arm.  I knew that was just from swelling in my armpit and I took Naproxsen.  It went away after about a week.  I have heard that rads can cause your tissue to continue to scar up to 6-12 months later and beyond.  My PS wanted me to wait for up to a year to do my exchange (TEs to real implants), but I told her that's not gonna happen -- so she said to come back in December and she will check the scarring.--- Oh, and on the Emu oil, I also rubbed it on my scalp and my hair came back in much thicker than it used to be.  So now I am rubbing it on my eyes so my lashes grow back nice and thick.  It also worked wonders to get rid of the hives I was suffering from after chemo. I'm not so sure I will miss the running back and forth to activities with my twins, but I do often like to sit and watch them as they run from the van to their class when I drop them at school -- so full of energy, sweetness and innocence.  And I do take a minute to just enjoy the feel of their tiny hands in mine when we are crossing the street. Today I will try to count my blessings.  The first one is that DH took the girls to school and I am back under the warm covers with my dog at my side. BTW --- GO GIANTS!!!! Jen",

Wow, Jenn -- four haircuts already!!  I have had one and need another but don't want to get it because I am pretty sure that all of my beautiful curl will hit the floor.  The curl was the only good side effect of chemo for me and I was hoping it would last forever.  Oh well. Daiva, take it easy and allow yourself to heal.  I had exchange surgery 6+ weeks ago and had to keep backing off activities because I would overdo it.  Now I am back to the gym 5x per week and back to my pre-cancer weight.  I have lost 18 pounds since I started exercising in mid-January.  Only 32 more to reach my goal!  That will be a weight I haven't seen in more than 15 years.

For those of you ladies here in the states who have children, you should look up Camp Kesem online and see if a university near you offers this program.  It's for kids whose parent has or had cancer.  My girls are going to a free week of sleep-away camp that is run by Stanford students.  The program is amazing and kids can go back year after year.  We recently went to an event and got to meet the counselors and many of the kids.  We were so impressed.  Plus, I can't wait to have my kids gone for a whole week!!!   That happens the week after 3rd grade lets out.  Then we leave for almost 7 weeks of (mostly) camping in Idaho, Montana, western Canada, Washington and maybe Oregon.  We are planning to do some horse back riding and rafting with the kids on this trip as well as some living history stuff and visiting a few National Parks.  Also have a house outside of Vancouver for a week on a home exchange.  It will be an action-packed summer, that's for sure.

I got immediate reconstruction with tissue expanders (which suck -- very uncomfortable) and a year later got them replaced with silicone implants.  Later I got 3D nipple tattoos, so my mounds are smooth but appear to have nipples.  I'd say I am fairly happy with the results, but it will never be the same as having my sweet little titties back :(  You lose a lot of the feeling when you lose the breast.  The nerves don't ever really grow back.  And they are much firmer than I would like -- esp. my rads side.  I always say that if my butt jiggled a little less and my boobs jiggled a little more I'd be perfect!  Anyway, it was important for me to know that since I was having the trifecta (mx, chemo, rads) I was doing everything I could do to get rid of the beast.  I didn't want to be second-guessing myself a few years down the road if I got cancer in the 2nd breast -- and no waiting for the proverbial \"other shoe\" to drop.  Anyway, sweetie, my angels are with you tomorrow. My life is pretty \"normal\" -- if you can ever call life normal.  I am still going to school, deep into the Court Reporting program.  People ask me about it and I tell them it's the hardest thing I've ever done -- and I've raised twins and beat cancer!  Court Reporting has about a 90% dropout rate!  It has been compared to trying to learn to become a concert pianist and having to pass a test every day at 95% or better.  It's neuro-muscular training and takes practice every day. Besides that, my girls are turning 10 this weekend.  We are having a Movie Star Mystery sleep-over party.  It should be loads of fun.  I was able to borrow a bunch of Oscar Party decorations from a friend.  Each girl has a character she is playing and when they show up for the awards ceremony the golden statue will have been stolen!!!  Then they have their scripts to read and based on that they will have to figure out who the criminal is.  After that it will be pizza, popcorn, cake, movies, giggling and sleepover time.  I can't believe my kids are 10.  My hubby and I just look at each other and say \"we're past the half-way mark\". My girls will be flying back east by themselves this month to stay with their aunties for over 2 weeks!  Larry and I are going camping in Idaho -- just like the old days.  I just want quality time with my four-Hs (hubby, hammock, hotsprings, huckleberries).  Yay. After that we are planning to take a month in Dec/Jan and go to Guatemala and Honduras.  We will start the trip with a week in Guatemala staying with a local family while we attend Spanish immersion classes every day.  Then we have Mayan ruins, jungles and beaches on the itinerary.  This is to celebrate my 50th birthday and the fact that the girls will soon be at an age where they don't want to spend this much time with us.  This may be our last chance! Kim and Denise, you are at wonderful times with your upcoming milestones -- wedding and baby!!! -- I just wish you were both feeling better and able to enjoy this time more.  They are both stressful blessings. I hope all you other May-Warriors are doing well.  Both those who keep up with the postings and those of you who just lurk.  My love to you all. Jennifer",

I have a feeling it has to do with the neupogen.  I took my last shot on Friday.  They tested my wbc at the ER and they were at 25,000.  That's somewhere around twice the rate for a normal person.  My onc does not believe it is the neupogen so she is referring me to an allergist.

Jenn, when I had my surgery I had a dmx w/ placement of Tissue Expanders, but the bras that were recommended by the PS nurses were cotton sports bras that hook in the front.  You won't be able to reach around back to hook your bras.  The ones they recommended were about $8 at KMart and worked very well keeping everything firmly held together. Leanna, the \"iron bra\" is a very common name for the tight feeling many women get with TEs.  I have the feeling at times like I have 2 tennis balls under my skin.  Pain and discomfort every day. Day, great hair.  Mine is about the same as yours but much darker.  I am able to \"style\" it with a little gel and get a kind of punk or just rolled out of bed look.  I had to go renew my driver's license today.  It really sucks that I didn't have to get a new picture for 10 years and then it has to be when I am growing out my chemo hair.  I'd love to hear about the stretches you did to help w/ the iron bra.  You can see Drim's great piece on Good Morning America's website.  Search for cold caps. Jersey, I can't wait to hear what you pick out and how you came to a decision.  How come you get to get new foobs so soon?  Do you have TE?  Did you do rads after chemo?  I have to wait til late December just to check on the scarring and might get to schedule for the first part of next year.  Can't come soon enough.  The one thing I am worried about is my PS told me she does saline implants almost exclusively and I am leaning toward silicone.  Does that mean I should find another PS?  Daiva, I am so sorry you got news of positive on BRCA.  That totally sucks.  So now your next step is an ooph?  I am just starting the genetic counseling to be able to get tested.  Please keep us posted on the ooph process.

Back to reality and a few messages for you ladies. Paxton -- yay.  Just yay! Patricia -- the only thing I would be worried about on your trip is the fatigue.  I finished my rads the first week in October and I am still tired.  In fact I come home every morning from dropping my girls at the bus stop and I nap for a good 2 hours.  So my advice is to build in LOTS of down time for the trip.  Your sister may need to go out and do things on her own in the afternoons so you can nap.  The trip sounds fabulous, BTW. NJ -- I can't begin to imagine how hard this whole journey has been without your husband by your side.  I am so sorry.  And just so you know I have a wonderfully supportive husband by my side and I am still an emotional basket case.  I don't know if it is end-of-treatment-blues, reactions to Tamoxifen (which I started about 6 weeks ago) or what. Just last night I burst into tears when I was reading Denise's post about how painful her burns are.  My DH couldn't figure out why I was crying.  ENOUGH ALREADY.  HAVEN'T WE SUFFERED ENOUGH? All day today I've been a crying mess.  Tears are streaming down my face as I write to you.  I have emailed my GP and we are discussing anti-depressants. Anyone ever hear of Remeron?  I looked it up and find that it is sometimes used as an appetite stimulant!  Oh great.  Just what I need. I turn 48 this Friday and all I want for my birthday is a few days without pain from these f***ing tissue expanders.  I will meet with the PS at the end of the month to see if we can schedule an exchange surgery.   It can't come too soon. OMG, Xray. Your puncture story scared the cr** out of me.  It makes me think twice about getting 3D tattoo nipples! Oh, and here's a good one.  I was talking to the Oncology Pharmacist today and I asked her if there was anything I could take to help ease the hot flashes.  She says, \"Well don't take black cohosh, that's not very good for you.  And let's see, you can't have any soy...\"  What?  I can't have any soy? No, you are estrogen positive and soy stimulates the estrogen receptors. What?  Why wasn't I told this WHEN YOU FOUND OUT I WAS ER+???  Like 9 months ago! Oh well.  I guess it's just another \"And then...\" At least I have you ladies to commiserate with.  Jen",

I wish I had a pedometer to measure how far we walked last week.  5 days of 9+ hours at the various Disney parks -- so much walking.  I weighed myself at the gym today and I lost 4 pounds while on vacation!  Most of that was due to the walking, but I did get a bit of a flu on the way home and lost some weight that way too.  So 12 pounds down and 38 to go! I've been going to the gym five days per week for the past 6 weeks and I think it's helping with my energy level. My exchange surgery is this Friday and then an MRI on Monday to check the suspicious node in my neck.  I am hoping to work out thru Thursday this week and then get back to the gym in 2 weeks to continue with lower body only for a while.

After dropping them off yesterday I went to a breakfast with about 20 of the parents.  We all introduced ourselves and I was quite saddened to learn that a number of them had lost their spouses to cancer.  There were a few who went through the cancer experiences alone because they were single parents.  Some children being raised by grandparents because both parents had passed. I can't imagine how hard those situations are.  When I first found out that kids could attend this camp every year until they were half way through high school, I wondered why they didn't just let them come for one year and then offer the camp to a new batch of kids.  One of the moms told me yesterday that the reason is that the kids need something to look forward to every year -- no matter what is happening within their families they can count on this week of fun and comraderie.  What a blessing. I was hoping that DH and I could take a couple of days this week and go away, but he is free-lance and now working so we need the money more than we need the time away.  So I am trying to organize my girls' room and closet.  I've ordered shelving and bins to put their massive amounts of 'stuff' in.  Having the carpets cleaned, going to the gym, getting ready for our big road trip that begins next week, cleaning out the van.  Yes, ladies -- I know how to live!

Summer - I have been going to the gym about 4x per week since January.  The first 20 pounds was cancer weight -- that was fairly easy to get off.  The rest is weight that I have been carrying around for about 15 years now.  In addition to exercise I have cut back on bread (most sandwiches are now open face or on a tortilla) and I will often have an apple or a bowl of oatmeal for dessert instead of the cookies and ice cream the rest of the family is having.  I think if I keep getting up early and going to the gym before school I'll be able to lose the weight because there is no eating in class so I generally have a yogurt and an apple for breakfast/lunch.  I do trade off though.  Fewer calories during the day allows me to have 2 cocktails at night! Vinnie - keep me posted as to a left coast journey.  Michelle from AZ tells me you are thinking of having traveling NipFests.  You would make a LOT of women happy that way.  I know that's your goal in life.  Sorry that they sold the car out from under you.  I believe that you will find a better car or a better deal.  Bright side!

Hey Daiva -- did you ever go to Vinnie for your finishing touch? Hugs and kisses to all. Jen",
