My oncologist just started me August 1st after my July 26th PET/CT scan showed disease progression with more bone mets and new cancerous nodes in my chest and right abdomen . I had been on Ibrance and Exemestane, but the combo did not manage the spread of my cancer. I have been on so many treatment plans since March 2015, but I am still moving along with a quality of life that I know only a loving God is providing. Being 70 years old, I am feeling so fatigued and struggling with nausea; however, as a heart disease patient, I am willing to stay the course for my treatment options are very limited now. Your postings are very encouraging. How are you doing keeping mouth scores away? I have a medicated steroidal mouthwash that is working well and I try to avoid foods that are quite spicy. Haven't had any diarrhea / constipation issues . Hopefully, all will stay well in that area.  I do hope the best for you and a successful journey of cancer treatment on Afinitor and Faslodex.  Looking forward to reading future postings.....",
