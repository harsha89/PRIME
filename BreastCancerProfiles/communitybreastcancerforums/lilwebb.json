My 1st tx was on May 9th, returned to work May 15th, worked for 6hrs and then a full day on Friday. I know it feels like hell for a few days, but you will feel better! I am getting only 3 more treatments, every three weeks. I would find out exactly why you are getting 6. Seems like you barely have enough time to recouperate in between! Good luck and god bless and know you are not alone in your fight! We will be right here helping you along. Take care, Kim",
