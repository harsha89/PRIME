They're feeling that they DOING something in a situation where the feel that there's actually nothing much to do. As being the one with the disease you DO things all the time, fighting cancer. You do treatments and try to stay alive, but the close ones around you probably need to feel they're doing something as well, somethings that really help you. That's how I try to look at it, sometimes it works. :) ",

My mother died from BC and yes, I think it would have been better if I had known about my genes (if they find anything...) than having BC myself... but that was 20 years ago so there were no test back then. I have two girls (21 and 4 years old) and my sister has two as well (9 and 5 years old) so yes, I can't really see the alternative that not having the test taken. I guess it all works a little bit different in Sweden though, as it doesn't cost anything to do the test (all healthcare costs are payed by taxes). ",
