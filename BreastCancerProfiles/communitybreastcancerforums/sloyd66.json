They think the therapist may have agitated it some, as I was able to move my arm with little to no pain. Now my shoulders been hurting, only when I move it a certain way. Have anyone else had problems with shoulder pains? I starting back in the gym, have a trainer. I was doing weights and it actually helped a little, just that some moves I can't do because I have no range in that arm.

And I'm only doing human hair. My hair stylist told me not to worry she's going to make me a wig that will match and be similar to my actual hair. If anyone no me and my hair she does, as I go to her every week for over 10 yrs. So after my oncology appt Tuesday on Wednesday I may be ready for her too start on making it. I did look at some nice lacefront wigs, but do you keep them on even sleep in them? or do you have to take it off, and put it back on?",
