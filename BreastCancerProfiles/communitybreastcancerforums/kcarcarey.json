Now the wait starts. I not only have the family history but I am a nurse. At this point being a nurse is a double edged sword. Can't stay off the Internet.  I was told by the radiologist that he was sure it is cancer and with my history I should consider double mastectomy.  I was told by the surge that it is 3cm and that he doesn't like to discuss anything until the results are back.",
