    "Content": "JanuarySunshine wrote: I'm 25 years old but I have already gone through two excisions for breast tumor. First it's just fibroadenoma two years ago and then it's atypically ductal hyperplasia(ADH) last year. I was surprised that for my age I had ADH, and I have no family history or cancer history.  Just a week ago I had breast MRI and the doctor said there's another area looked suspicious. I was so tired of going through the tests and biopsies and excisions. They said they will put a titanium marker in that area and they said it's no harm, but I asked my another radiologist that I don't have children yet and I wonder if it will affect feeding, and she said there might be a minor effect or something like that. If the titanium marker is really harmful for feeding, then I would rather not have it. Could someone who have gone through this before give me some advice on it? I would be very appreciated.
