I asked him to go with me today because I have to have additional biopsies on both sides and if they can't get what they need MRI biopsies tomorrow. I feel like every piece of information I get gets worse. It's hard to be positive. He said ur stage 1 .... Hello I said its still a stage and it's still scary... Bottom line he's not coming with me his father is coming.... Ughhhhh",

I am a single mom of two, I was hoping that doing the Bmx I wouldn't have to do more, then the onco type came back high at 32. My sister opted out of chemo and rads the first time.

Edi I know how u feel sadly I was petrified if my dad as well which is why I think it's so hard for me to crunch the cockroach once and for all. As long as he stays out of the house it's fine. It's just hard for me to move on with my life, tho, I don't have much time and my kids are so important to me right now. Sorry I am carrying on about me.....

Work has decided to staff by volume which means if I don't have enough work I am to leave without pay or take vacation but with all this BC crap I have 20 hours if vacation. The kids are getting busy and sports bills are coming in. It's just stressful but I am healthy and I have beautiful nipples (no Prince Charming but that would be too much right now anyway). It stinks not having someone to tell me everything is going to be alright for that comfort but. That's life and I and trying hard to deal with it. I have been reading just not up to posting.

I wanted to let u girls know starting chemo, I had my second treatment yesterday. I feel great. I ate today, waaaayyyyyy to much I gained 5 lbs in two days. The only side effect I have so far is some insomnia. Hence why I am up. My kids are 11, and 8 so I don't like to take the Ativan as I am a single mom and want to be able to wake up and drive in case of emergency but that's just me. We got this girls the meds are here to help and call the docs if u need anything. As far as hair mine come out day 14, 10 to 15 strands at a time and I will probably shave it this weekend. The loss I am have a hard time with because of course I finally have grown it out and I like it. Just today someone said ur fair looks great it has gotten so long- great. It will be gone soon. Ladies all this too shall pass. Sorry for the long post. I will take notes. I am so sorry for those who are having bad side effects today. Tomoorrow is a new day!!! I love u girls !!!",

I am having such a hard time with the hair thing. My counselor tells me my hair doesn't define me and I get that. I just hate it. I am so depressed today. I do have the worst husband ever if u all only knew he is not abusive physically but mentally. I am having such a hard time separating myself from him. I am trying to get thru this and not let him bother me but we got in such a wicked fight last night. It so good to hear from all of you. I hate feeling so alone so thank all off you for helping me thru this part of my life.",
