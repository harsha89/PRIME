I am only in BC to complete my Honors degree and hopefully back to Alberta for my Masters and PhD. I loved my GP in Alberta and wish I was there whilst going through this. With any luck this is nothing - but if this is something then I will hopefully be home by this time next year.  Thank you for the information. Part of my fear is my ignorance. I always used to joke that, given my family history, it was not a moatter of if I got cancer but when and where... I am now regretting having said this. ",

      "Content": "DreamingApe wrote: I have yet to go in for an ultrasound. It was just yesterday that the lump was found and I had previously believed the recent nipple discharge was due to a hormone imbalance as I take hormones to treat stage 4 endometriosis. My mother has had both breast and ovarian cancer and her sister, my aunt, has recently had a double mastectomy and suffered cervical cancer in her teens. I know nothing of my biological father's family history though I know his mother died of some form of cancer. There is a prevalence of cancer amongst males also in my mother's side.... Despite all of this, I was surprised to find out that I am too young to get a diagnostic mammogram even though my doctor has requested one; I only just turned 30 this past Saturday and apparently it cannot be done before 35. I would think, given my symptoms combined with my family history, that diagnostis screening would be done but will not unless the ultrasound indicates it is necessary. As the single mother of a five year old who relies entirely on me, I am very concerned that this is something and may not be found in ultrasound. HAs anyone else experienced this? Am i worrying unnecessarily that this may be something but might not be found in just an ultrasound? MY primary concern is that I am healthy and well enough to continue to care for and provide for my son. Thank you for allowing me to vent  Log in to post a reply",

I have undergone many treatments for the endo (and in looking through this and other websites I see this can also be a risk factor!) including two rounds of Lupron, Danazol, continuous birth control (which ended quickly when I discovered that estrogen is the primary cause of the migraines I suffer from). Currently, and since October last year, I have been on Medroxy progesterone (essentially Depot but taken in pill form daily and at a much higher dosage than would be taken for birth control)... I am basically in a false menopause but without the flashes and other symptoms I had on Lupron. My initial reaction with the discharge was that it was caused by the anti-depressant I was taking (the progesterone has caused depression and panic issues, presumably, given the time I started the medication and when depression and panic attacks hit) but has not gone away with switching to a more effective anti-depressent.  Given the difficulties I have had with the progesterone,  I would not be surprised if this is the cause. However, given my family history, symptoms, and because I am a smoker (I know, it's stupid) I am worried. I just hope that this is something much more benign than cancer but I am trying to prepare myself for the eventuality that it may be. If nothing else, I have learned a lot of potentially useful information today. Thank you to all who have responded.",

My doctor does want both an ultrasound and a mammogram, however, in British Columbia, I schedule the appointment as opposed to the doctor and it is the company which does both of these exams who are denying me the mammogram. They will do the ultrasound but not the mammogram due to my age. I did explain my symptoms and family history to the lady booking the appointment but this did not change anything. I was told that a mammogram would only be done should the ultrasound indicate it is needed. Having been diagnosed with endometriosos (when I was 15) I have had many an ultrasound, which have not always found potential problems (such as cysts) that were later discovered during laparoscopic surgery, I worry that this lump may not necessarily indicate all the information in just an ultrasound. I do have to admit that I am largely ignorant to all of this; I know nothing about mammograms but it seems that testing used predominantly to investigate abnormalities in the breast may give more information than just an ultrasound would.... I just hope that I am worrying needlessly ",
