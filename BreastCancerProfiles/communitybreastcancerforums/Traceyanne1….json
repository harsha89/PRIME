Took her to the doctor after waiting for a call back and was told to wait a few days to see if anything changes.  It still seems sore to touch and my daughter now has a sore throat and slightly swollen throat glands but that could be completely another thing.  Anyway will keep a thought and prayer for you and hope all is okay for both of our girls. Hoping it\u2019s puberty and the change , (obviously don\u2019t want her to grow up so fast but just don\u2019t want her to be in pain etc).  Tracy",
