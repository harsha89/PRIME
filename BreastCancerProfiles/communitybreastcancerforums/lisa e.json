It may be hard to design studies on le, but I still would like to see such studies.  As I have had lymph nodes out on bilaterally, I find the standard risk reduction precautions to be very difficult to adhere to.  Every doctor's visit, every blood test is a mine field that has to be carefully negotiated.  I would like to know if the precautions are really necessary - or if I am falsely relying on a body of knowledge that is based experience and tradition.   I would like to rely on both evidence and the body of knowledge.   If we don't question the precautions and le treatments we won't make any progress and I don't see the harm in suggesting other women may feel the same way I do. I wonder if you could do a retrospective study looking at breast cancer patients who have had lymphnode removal and compare those who developed le and those who didn't.  What risk precautions did each group take?",

I am a climber and while some would say I should have stopped to reduce my risk for le, I found I was unwilling to. After my mast, I started climbing again, slowly, wearing a sleeve.

I started considering my options when I had a second round of biopsies after a lumpectomy and SNB. Luckily, my conclusion that a mastectomy was my only option agreed with my doctor's reccomendations. I don't know if the suspicous areas you having tested are in the same breast that you had the lumpectomy or not. If you have a second cancer, a mastectomy may be your only option. However, if the second cancer is your other breast, you could have a lumpectomy. Don't rush into a mastectomy. Reconstruction does not give you breasts with sensation. I miss that sensation and think it is worth trying to preserve. Anyway, homealone is right that the results may well be b9. If not, make a decision based on the results of biopsies. Don't make a decision on the basis of emotion only. I hope you don't need to make any decisions and all is normal.",

Of course, that is based on my experience. I asked my oncologist about an MRI when I met with him before my surgery. He said he didn't recommend one as the rate of false positives was too high. I was happy enough to go along with him. When my surgeon examined me before surgery (for an area of high grade DCIS), he felt a dimple and decided to remove what was causing the skin retraction. That turned out to be a small invasive tumor, not seen on mammograms. The radiation oncologist asked me to have an MRI before starting rads. I did, had four more biopsies, and it was found that I had another invasive tumor. It was agreed that my only surgical option was a mastectomy. Having an MRI pre surgery would have meant I could have had one surgery. It would have saved me money and time off work.",

Anyway, if you are nervous I suggest making the appointment for your fitting in person so you get a feel for the store.  Also, take a friend along if you think that would make you feel better.  Finally, I do agree with the folks who say there is no need get forms before you want to.  And if you never want to, don't worry about it.   ",

I could have had one surgery instead of two.  However, the time lag gave me time to consider my options and play \"what if\".  By the time I had the MRI and biopsies, I knew I would have a bilateral mastectomy if any of the biopsy results were positive. I think it is reasonable to demand biopsies of the suspicious areas.  Given the high number of false positives with MRI, there may be nothing to be concerned about.  If you do have another diagnosis, you can take it from there.    Good luck on Friday!",

I took it off while the tech postioned me - then she covered me with a blanket.      I found the breast MRI was a lot easier than the MRI I had for my hip.  I didn't find it uncomfortable to lay face down, while I was having muscle spasms from lying in the postion required for the hip MRI.  I just did a lot of deep breathing and got very relaxed.   It was not an awful experience.

To be honest, I would have preferred to have a lumpectomy, but had to have a mastectomy as my bc was discovered to be multi-centric after my initial surgery. Like you I was quite busty, so I decided to have a bilateral. I do miss my breasts, but do have the consolation of knowing I didn't have any other options. I decided against reconstruction because I wanted to minimize any surgery. I had a total hip replacement a month before i was dx with bc in addition to a lumpectomy, an excisional biopsy and SNB. I was tired and couldn't imagine going through reconstruction. Also, I am a climber and hike a lot. I really did not want implants under my pecs or to have another major scar from a flap surgery. I am reasonably pleased with the appearance of my chest. My surgeon asked a plastic surgeon to help with the surgery, so i didn't wind up with dog ears or extra skin. My scars run from my sternum to under my arms. There are also smaller scars that run from what was the nipple area to the main scar. My range of motion is normal and I have been able to resume climbing and hiking. However, I do have a lot of adhesions and my chest usually feels tight. As the scar from my hip replacement also has some adhesions, I think that is just the way my body heals. I massage the scars, stretch a lot and even after a year I still notice some changes. I find the Breast Free site very helpful: breastfree.org/ Good luck! I think you will find the transition to being flat chested to be interesting, some hilarious moments, some sad moments, but doable.",

I had a matectomy because I had multicentric cancer and it was the only surgical option available to me. I am well beyond my child rearing years but I still miss my breasts. A mastectomy is major surgery, with or without reconstruction. You can have permanent side effects including numbness, nerve damage (look for the thread on post mastectomy pain syndrome) and lymphedema. Also, it is not a gaurantee you will not have a local or distant recurrence. And you don't get a do over if you don't like the result. Therefore, I think limegreen is right, you should consider the medical reasons for preferring a mastectomy over a lumpectomy. I would ask your doctors what they recommend and why they are making that recomendation. Then I would get a second opinion before making any decisions.",

I was admitted to the hopsital on Saturday for cellulitits in my shin. I had my iv in my foot as my le is bilateral. I never had a fever or felt ill. If I hadn't looked at my leg on Thursday night when I undressed, I wouldn 't have known I had it. I watched it for a while and realized it wasn't spreading fast, if at all, so decided to skip the emergency room in favor or seeing the doctor first thing in the morning. The doctor admited me after oral anti-biotics and shots didn't work. I am glad she decided to get agressive because I was worried about my artifical hip - same leg. If my prosthesis became infected, I would be toast. Luckily, it is fine - they did xrays and a ct scan. Jo, I hope you are feeling better soon and survive the antibiotics. Lisa",

I am happy with my decision and think I look fine without a prosthesis.   While I have gotten a few puzzled looks from casual friends (male, of course) I don't think most people notice anything odd about my appearance.  When I can start wearing a prosthesis, I'll get one to wear if I want to wear clothing that would look better if I had 'breasts'.   Reading the threads on this site and looking at BreastFree helped me feel comfortable with my decision not to have reconstruction.   When I was considering reconstruction versus no reconstruction , my surgeon referred me to a plastic surgeon so I could make an 'informed decision.'   The plastic surgeon had me watch a video about reconstruction.  As I think a truly informed decision can only be made with input about all options,  I should have also been required to watch a video about opting out of reconstruction.",

When you mentioned the dimple to me during the exam, I didn't ask you about its significance. I should have, because I woke up with three scars instead of the two I expected. To my radiation oncologist, I am really glad you asked me to get an MRI to check for the extent of disease before I started radiation. Good idea, considering I had another IDC that didn't show up on the mammogram. To my oncologist, I wish you had suggested the MRI after I was first diagnosed with DCIS. I asked you about one and you said you didn't think it was necessary as there were too many false positives. I was more than willing to go along with your thinking, so I have not held that against you. However, I do resent the fact that you could not remember if I had large breasts or not when we discussed my mastectomy over the phone. At that point you had met and examined me twice.",

When I was deciding whether or not to have reconstruction, I asked my husband for his opinion.  He wouldn't tell me, because he did want to influence me.  As it turns out, he initially though I should have reconstruction.  But as I talked to him about my decision, he understood and accepted it.   My husband has seen my scars from the beginning and I don't hide them.   I don't think he is repulsed or bothered by them.    I don't think being my flat has affected our sex lives.  The major problem is I have no libido after taking anti-hormonals for three years.  My husband has his own sexual issues.  In a way we are well matched... :-) Baywatcher, I don't know where you are in treatment or if you are taking anti-hormonal drugs, but I was in a grey, miserable fog when I took tomoxifen.  Just saying . . .
