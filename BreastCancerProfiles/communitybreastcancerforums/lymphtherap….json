I agree you will get different answers.  It is very possible that it will be of little consequence.  It is more important to get the procedure.  I usually inform my patients, that when in doubt wrap the limb at nighttime after the procedure so that you manage the lymphatic overload and your angst!  The mantra that I impart is \"When in doubt, wrap!\"  Compression bandaging at night reduces  the volume, where as compression daytime sleeve for the most part contains volume.

Research shows that two significant associated factors, both potentially controllable, are identified, weight gain and infection. Kane 744, I agree people need to be educated.  I lecture to practicing physicians.  They are not trained in this sequelae of breast cancer treatment.  Teaching to the community is what I focus on, especially on empowering people on how to manage if swelling occur, (prophylactic nighttime short stretch compression bandaging based on how the limb feels).  This many times allows for empowerment, control and containment in  a least bothersome but most effective way .  Because everyone's surgery is different, there is very little consistency on what exacerbates lymphedema.  Yes we need more LE therapists.  The next available opening for me to see a new patient is in January 2011.  The training is very scarce and there are companies preying on \"lymphedema\" scare to inadequately train therapists. In addition, there are reimbursement issures for healthcare providers, thus limiting offering this service.Please make sure that any LE therapist you seek advice from meets the following criteria:  lymphnet.org/pdfDocs/nlntraini... ",

Due to the elasticity, it is almost impossible to have an equal and consistent pressure grade on the limb. This \"bunching\" or irregularity further hinders lymph flow. I believe the inelastic medafit glove by biacare is a better hand product for nighttime use than the Farrow Microfine glove.  I am following the concepts imparted by my Casley-Smith and Vodder training. The glove is an excellent product.  If you feel as a clinician it meets the needs of your patient far be it from me to disagree. I was only offering another opinion. ",

As a therapist, I must be familiar with all that is out there and make recommendations based on the patient need. What works for one person doesn't necessarily work for someone else because of tissue texture, volume and speed of refill.  That is where clinical judgment comes into play.  When patients call me on the phone and ask which garment to buy, I cannot give an answer without palpating the limb or at least know their history.   Sometimes, a daytime garment isn't need but nighttime bandaging  maybe all somene needs to contain swelling. Again, recommendations are all personalized.",
