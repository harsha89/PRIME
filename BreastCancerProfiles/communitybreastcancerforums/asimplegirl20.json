I believe it feels smooth, I have no pain, no physical \"warning\" signs such as inverting or discharge, but I had an ultrasound done a few days ago and the doctor started out saying it was \"nothing to worry about\" then got the results back and said it was \"abnormal\" and is referring me to a breast center for further consultations. I am very scared. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you so much. Log in to post a reply",
