The tech spoke about the letter but said that could her words \"take a while\". I was told the radiologist would read the films this afternoon and would contact the doctor with his report. How long should I give them before I call, I was thinking about this time next week? Does that sound about right? If I do that I can try and bury this in the back of my mind until then...right??",

To put my mind at ease I made an appt. my PCP didn't see it but set up a mammo as I was do for one anyways (2 years overdue!). 2 years ago I had an excisional biopsy and what turned out to be B9 lump in the right breast, all good I thought. Told to get a mammo every year, I didn't for whatever reason. So, the end of last week I had my mammo. got a call yesterday (after the mammo tech saying she saw the dimple and how it often idicates cancer) saying the LEFT breast was fine (the one with the dimple!) but the right showed a suspicious area of concern so I needed another mammo and ultrasound which I had done this morning. Believe me, I'm happy that my LEFT one seems to be fine, but what else would explain the dimple? It's a slight dimple but it becomes obvious when I lift my arm up . I'm also willing to bet the suspicious area is just scar tissue from the excisional biopsy as I don't feel any lumps. So, what could be causing the dimple??? Log in to post a reply",

I have read that many have the dimple have a normal mammo. only to find out it was cancer after all. If they could give me a cause for the dimple I would be fine but everyone seems clueless on what has caused it. Plus, I was told I have FibroCystic Breast disease, which I realize is totally benign, but have read women with this should also have MRIs as a follow up to the mammo. I have a family history of BC with relatives on both sides and my aunt who was only in her late 30's early 40's when diagnosed. Do I just ask my doctor for the MRI, or should I see a breast specialist and have that person set up the MRI. Still waiting for results of the second mammo on the right breast (the one without the dimple) and ultrasound on the right,",

      "Content": "kristie78 wrote: Okay,  I already have a thread about what I have found on my breast, but I have a few questions about dimpling/puckering in general. I see a dimple in my breast my doctor said she didn't see it so this leads me to this I have shown it to other people (showing the boobs off has become normal for the past couple of days!) My mother saw it right away, my boyfriend once it was pointed out he saw it, I showed it to a few friends and they saw it without me telling them where it was. Again, no lump that I can feel but I have lumpy feeling boobs anyway... Now, since the doc. didn't see it will it be ignored if the mammo doesn't show anything? What else could cause the dimpling/puckering? I have been looking at the boobs so much that I'm afraid I may be seeing things that aren't there and all that nonsense. The doctor says the left one is smaller than the right, I had an excisional biopsy on the right and a rather large fibroadenoma was removed so if anything you would think the right would be smaller. Doc also made the comment \"my goodness what is going on with your breast...\"  Which had me a bit unnerved.. Any help/info would be great! Thanks Kristie Log in to post a reply",
