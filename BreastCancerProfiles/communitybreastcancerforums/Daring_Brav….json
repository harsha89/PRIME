Everything looks good! The lump is a hematoma, combination of tissue and clotted blood that I apparently got after the lumpectomy I had in Nov 2016. It's possible that it's been there and has just grown in size. I have lost 25lbs since then and with the weight loss, the lump is now palpable. I have a follow up appointment for an ultrasound and to see the Dr at the breast health clinic in December. I am so relieved!! @whitleypark how did everything go? Did they tell you anything? I'm hoping that you too received good news!",

I have my US next Wednesday and will then wait for a call from the breast health clinic to let me know. I hope you're able to relax a little now. What do you continue to feel anxious about? Southernbelle77 - Sorry you're also having to go through this again. I had a lumpectomy for suspicious lump in 2016 but all was good. My lump feels close to the surface and it's between scar from breast reduction 20 yrs ago and the lumpectomy scar. The indent or pucker is in the exact spot the lump is located. Nothing I can do about any of it until the ultrasound. Until then, I will remain positive",

I had a lumpectomy in 2016 and everything was good ðŸ˜ŠA few weeks ago I found a small, hard, pea sized lump in my right breast, in the area the lumpectomy was done. It is also indented/puckered. The lump wasn't found on mammogram but I saw the Dr at the breast health clinic and I am scheduled for an ultrasound next Wednesday. Waiting is the worst. Like you, I research and google everything, which I feel is a normal reaction. Good luck today, will be sending you positive thoughts! C",

I think the entire situation causes stress, stress causes anxiety, anxiety causes symptoms. I try to take a deep breath, relax as much as I can, the waiting for the next step is the most difficult for me. Hope you're doing ok.",
