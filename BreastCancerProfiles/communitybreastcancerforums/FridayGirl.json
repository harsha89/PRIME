My oncologist started me on 8 x 3 weekly cycles of Taxotere, Herceptin and Perjeta and he couldn't believe how my tumour markers are falling.  I began on 500, and three weeks later, just before my second treatment, the tumour markers had fallen to 300.  I still have problems with diarrhoea but it is not as bad as last year.  I am due to have my third treatment next week, and will be interested to see what the figures are then.  My oncologist has put me on Codeine which seems to be used for all sorts of things, painkiller, decongestant etc, and it has a side effect of constipation which balances out against the diarrhoea from the Perjeta.  There is always something in his kitbag to help, thank goodness.",

Lisajo, if you want a positive story I can tell you of my aunt's neighbour.  Breast cancer travelled into her bones 20 years ago.  Since that time she has had two sessions of radiotherapy, and some days the pain is so bad she takes to her bed.  She is still around, she is not one of the lucky 3% who get metastatic cancer and it never appears again, but she is living with the disease and last year celebrated her 70th birthday.",

I think there is a general problem here with people not talking about the fact that they have mets for any type of cancer whatsoever.  As a result, when I was diagnosed I thought that it was extremely rare - I didn't realise it happens to 30% of breast cancer patients.  I now spend a lot of time reading the various threads on this discussion board because I learn so much about it.  The day after I was diagnosed I went into work and told everybody I met about my situation because I was determined that it was not going to be a secret, and it is definitely not something I am ashamed of.  If only people were more open about it, we would see just how long they were living and it would take away some of the fear.",
