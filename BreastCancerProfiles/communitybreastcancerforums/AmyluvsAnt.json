My 2 grown daughters know there is a high possibility i have BC and are both being very supportive and encouraging to me. With the physician offices giving you access to your labs and reports online, my surgeon was surprised i had not already read my reports online when i went in to see her. She too was very honest with me as to what it looked Like to her and the doctors reading my mammo and US. I'm usually very optimistic and encourage my patients to be, but somehow preparing for the worst and then getting good news is strangely more appealing to me than the alternative. I agree with the post of hang on to that doctor. But let your children know that you are going through this. Even though you don't know for sure, they will either releived this turns out be nothing or support for you if it does.  ",

Both of my daughters know me very well and i was a basket case emotionally and knew i couldn't hide it from them. Prayers for you. Prayers for your daughter in law and that the mag sulfate stops the contractions. My girls are both very strong women and their support has been very helpful. I lost mom back in October and as much i love husband and father, men don't understand what feeling right now. So having my daughters has really helped emotionally.",

My diagnostic mammogram and US came back Bi-Rads category 5. I have an US guided biopsy scheduled for Monday. The mammogram and US measured the mass as 2.1 x 1.3 x 1.6 but the surgeon i saw stated she Feels a mass that is twice that size. I have been a nurse for over 20 years but CA is definitely not my field. The surgeon gave me the whole looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it must be a duck. Basically she believes a malignancy and all the biopsy is for to determine hormone markers etc. Any chance this something other than CA??? Log in to post a reply",

My mammogram from about 5 years ago required further images in the same area but i was told it was nothing to worry about. Obviously they were wrong. Nurses are the worst when it comes to their own health. Kicking myself now for not addressing this as soon as i found it, but it changed frequently and all of the things i learned in nursing pointed to not being cancer. Any lump you find needs to be checked out. Mammograms need to be done annually. Like i said nurses need to take better care of themselves and their preventive care must be done.",

It felt like the lump ruptured while It was being compressed in the machine and was very sore for several days afterwards. That to me was some of the worse pain i have experienced in my life. After reading some posts today and the pain associated with and following the biopsy, I'm not too excited to do it either.",

I had to wait 2 weeks to have the biopsy because it takes 2 weeks to get procedure approved by my insurance company. I had no idea how hard it was going to be to have to wait until now. They have called me 3 times today from the breast center to ask the same questions. Each time they tell me something different the caller before them didn't tell me. Want to just go to bed and wake up and it be Monday already. Then there is the whole wait another week for results from the doctor. Really hate the wait . My mother passed away in October so not having her here with me makes this even harder. Funny how a grown woman wants Mommy when scared.",
