She is testing me for gene mutations, scheduling me for another PET and Bone scan, and having all of my prior pathology testing reviewed by the staff at Duke. I have to make a 5 hour drive to see her, but I feel like I am in good hands. She says my cancer doesn't \"act\" right, that triple negative doesn't usually resurface 4 years out, and since my pathology reports and tests have always been inconclusive about whether or not is it indeed breast cancer, she is turning every stone to get a clear answer.",

I am happy to meet you, and hope to positively contribute to this small TNBC world we are in. I am now stage 4 with mets to spine and lung. I had radiosurgery on both lesions and hopefully they are both gone. I will be having a scan in a couple of weeks to see if the radiosurgery worked. My oncologist is recommending lifetime low dose chemo, but is also sending me to Duke for a second opinion. I am scared, but positive. Any and all advice about treatments, etc are welcome.",
