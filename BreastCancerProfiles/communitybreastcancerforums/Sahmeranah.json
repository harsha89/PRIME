I sure do not. And I sooo need to vent. Rant topic #1. Radiation tech small talk. Ordinarily I am happy to talk to just about anyone, but I want it to mean something. For this reason, I dislike hair salons. Radiation therapy seems very much like going to a hair salon except I have *#$(*# cancer and am lying naked in the middle of a room being irradiated. Rant topic #2: Radiation tech greetings. To the radiation techs who say, emptily and with faux cheer: \"How are you today?\" each morning I would like to say \"How am I? I have cancer, my boob is mutilated, I have cancer [twice because I've been extremely forgetful since my diagnosis] and now I'm being blasted with radiation. That is how I am.\" I get that that is a relevant question for doctors and nurses and PAs to ask, but for radiation techs who clearly are saying it automatically, without a purpose -- it just seems gross and inappropriate. Why not just: \"Hi\" or \"good morning\"? Rant topic #3: Radiation tech attempts to go beyond small talk. I don't know about you, but as for me, I'm still adjusting to this diagnosis, still wrapping my head around what has happened to my body. I'm not \"there\" yet, to the point where any of this shit is normalized to the point where I feel like talking about what I did over the weekend with strangers while I am prone, half naked, baring a mangled boob. Rant topic #4: We are not a many-headed patient-hydra. One day last week when it was -1 F outdoors and I came into the freezing radiation room wearing two gowns, a hat and a scarf, one of my radiation techs said, as I was getting situated on the gurney, \"I feel sorry for you guys, it's so cold in here.\" Both her delivery (blase, light, whatever-ish) and the content really bugged me. We are all different. We are all involuntarily on an awful journey, not of our choosing. We're not a monolithic group of humanity -- but I guess to her we are. I can imagine that -- they see patient after patient, all day long, day after day. But still, for me, not having accepted my diagnosis, let alone the loss of my breast, let alone the fact that I need RT -- that was really a crap thing to hear. Also, if you're gonna feel sorry for \"us\" -- how about the fact that we have effing cancer rather than that we have the shivers? Rant topic #5: Musical accompaniment to radiation. Where I am it's pop-rock from the late 1960s-1970s (\"Where is the Love,\" \"Seasons in the Sun,\" \"I learned the truth at 17,\" \"Cats in the Cradle,\" \"Alone again (Naturally)). I find this dispiriting. It's like the soundtrack to a sad Oxygen Network movie about a doomed but feisty lady with breast cancer. F that. Thank you for listening. And if you have spleen to express, BRING IT ON. :) Log in to post a reply",
