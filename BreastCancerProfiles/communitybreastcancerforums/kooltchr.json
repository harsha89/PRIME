I'm trying massage and turmeric for swelling and seems to work very well. Turmeric is also a natural pain reliever. I haven't asked Dr. yet what it is, but did research on several cancer sites. Chemo starts next week, so I'll ask then, but turmeric seems to be helping. I use capsule from GNC, but it is a spice you can get in grocery store. Your mom can try this, and see if it helps.Its all natural, so can't hurt.",
