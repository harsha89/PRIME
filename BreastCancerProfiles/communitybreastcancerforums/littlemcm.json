Waited 9 years for my reconstructive breast surgery as my children were young when I was diagnosed and I was glad to be alive and functioning.  As my breast aged and my children aged - I decided to drop the ball and have my breasts redone 3 years ago.  Well, had a mamo last week and received a call back that they see microcalcifications on the left breast (not the original cancer breast which was my right breast.)  Well, very long weekend and went back this morning for magnified films of the area of concern.  I am happy to report that the calicfications were around the nipple area of my left breast which was lifted 3 years ago.  Apparently calcifications tend to form 3 years after a surgery or breast trauma. The calicfications in my breast are forming along the scar tissue around the nipple area and are benign.   80% of microcalcifications are benign.  So hang in there if you're waiting for results and just be glad that they have the technology to find these things at an early stage as it's much easier to deal with at an early stage rather than invasive stage which is what I faced 12 years ago.  Keep busy and think positive thoughts and I am sure that you too will have a positive outcome.  ",
