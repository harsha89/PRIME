The drill is the same, more tattooes, a body mold etc. The first time was for 6 weeks. That was12 years ago. It was extremely tedious going every day but I got through it, I drove myself. I am fair and used a cream and was fine. Now I am using aquaphor and it's keeping my skin moist. I am also taking oral drugs. Alll this is necessary for survival. It has to be done. My time was late in the day too for the first weeke but now it's been changed. You compromise and work things out. Good luck to everyone.",
