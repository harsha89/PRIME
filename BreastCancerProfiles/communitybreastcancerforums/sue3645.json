I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer with liver mets last year (ER+, PR+, HER2-).  Taxol + Avastin cleared up the liver mets and resolved the majority of the breast too.  I had a bilateral mastectomy four weeks ago. I will start rads in about two weeks. My radiation onc would like me to have rads every day for six weeks. She'd also like me to have hyperthermia twice a week. Hyperthermia is where they heat up the rads area to make the rads more effective. They'll heat it up to about 108 degrees, which the doc says may cause \"some discomfort\" (ya think???). The theory is that the heat will make the rads more effective -- been shown to work in some cases. It's used mostly in cases of bc recurrence (as well as prostate and rectal cancer), but they think it may be of benefit in the metastatic setting. The rad onc said they don't do it everywhere -- Duke is using it the most, not sure if other places are trying it. Has anyone heard of this?   Done it?  Have research on it?   Thanks so much !! Sue dx IBC 10/30/07, liver mets 11/13/07. Taxol+Avastin for nine months. Bilateral Mastectomy in August 2008. Radiation from Sept - Nov 2008. NED since then! Log in to post a reply",
