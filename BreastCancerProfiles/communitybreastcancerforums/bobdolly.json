Right now I am taking Xeloda and Tykerb and will have a scan Monday to see if the cancer is at least stable.  I know how you feel.  It gets very old feeling crappy, losing your hair (3 times now), having your feet and hands hurt and just knowing that you have cancer.  I am sending you a big hug, hang in there.
