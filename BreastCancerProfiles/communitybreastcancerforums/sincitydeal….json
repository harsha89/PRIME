And sonofcancermom, you're a wonderful and caring son. Peggy",

I'm so very sorry you're going through such a hard time.  I just lost my Mom in July.  I know how you feel. Peggy http://www.hospicepatients.org/terminal-agitation.html",

The first thing I did was send her a wig, because losing her hair has bothered her more than the chemo itself, I think.  She, too, thinks she looks just horrible. My mother isn't computer literate so I've been reading some of the posts from these wonderful women.  It's been a great help to her.  These women have such good advice and, it has been a source of comfort to her to hear what they have to say.  I live far away from her and it's really hard, but I'm going down to visit her in March to help her with cleaning her house and doctor appointments, etc.  Those things will mean a lot to her.  I can appreciate the way you two feel.  I feel helpless, too. Just have your moms read or listen to what these women have to say.  They're a bunch of smart cookies!",

According to my Mom's onc, you can live a long time with this disease.  It's not the automatic death sentence it used to be.  There are so many treatments out there now.  It may be painful to live with, but your doctors will help you manage the pain. You will receive a lot of encouragement on this board from women that have lived with this disease for years.  One makes a yearly post on her cancer anniversary.  She's been living with Stage lV for 18 years and living well.  There are also some very young people on this forum.  You might hear from Texasrose.  She's in her late 20's also.  I'm so sorry that this is happening to you at such a young age, but hopefully youth will be on your side to fight this nasty disease. Come to this site often and listen to these wise women.  They will give you some great advice and encouragement.  They've had a lot of experience in dealing with this, and you will hear from many of them.  I hope you feel better soon, after you get over the initial shock.

I grew up in tornado country.  Believe me, it's scary.  You hear those sirens start up and you head for the basement.  My husband has a tornado phobia.  We're heading back to Missouri in June, and he is freaking!

      "Content": "Feb 15, 2015 02:20PM sincitydealer wrote: I'm so sorry your Mom's going through this. I had a similar experience with my Mother for about three weeks before she passed. She insisted she had to go to the bathroom every five minutes, couldn't stand being in bed, and would pick at her sheets. She also did a lot of repetitive motion. I hope this article will help you to figure out what's going on. I know how hard this must be on all of you.   Many families may be surprised when a terminally ill (and usually calm) family member becomes restless or even agitated. The depth of such restlessness or agitation varies from patient to patient. When moods change or personalities seem to change, family members may be completely bewildered and feel helpless: not knowing what to do. It is common knowledge that individuals who are experiencing even minor illnesses may demonstrate mood changes such as irritability, anger, depression and avoid communication with others. When a terminal illness not only initially strikes, but is now nearing the end, patients may experience profound mood changes. Such mood changes are often difficult for family members to \"handle.\" Causes and treatments for restlessness and agitation are well-known among the palliative care professionals who work with the dying on a regular basis. Those who work with the dying know this type of restlessness or agitation almost immediately. However, the public and patient's family may have no idea what is going on and often become quite alarmed at their loved one's condition. What does it look like? Although it varies somewhat in each patient, there are common themes that are seen over and over again. Patients may be too weak to walk or stand, but they insist on getting up from the bed to the chair, or from the chair back to the bed. Whatever position they are in, they complain they are not comfortable and demand to change positions, even if pain is well managed. They may yell out using uncharacteristic language, sometimes angrily accusing others around them. They appear extremely agitated and may not be objective about their own condition. They may be hallucinating, having psychotic episodes and be totally \"out of control.\" At these times, the patient's safety is seriously threatened. Some patients may demand to go to the hospital emergency room, even though there is nothing that can be done for them there. Some patients may insist that the police be called ... that someone unseen is trying to harm them. Some patients may not recognize those around them, confusing them with other people. They may act as if they were living in the past, confronting an old enemy. Just as in all symptoms, other causes must first be ruled out or eliminated. Nurses must make sure that the physician's orders are being followed, that if any other symptoms are not well managed, the physician is contacted or adjustments are made in order to relieve those symptoms. Physicians and nurses must continually re-assess the patient's total overall condition, monitoring every body system's function. Checking vital signs including pain levels is a first step. Is the patient breathing effectively? Is oxygen being given if appropriate for the patient's disease condition? Carefully evaluating, recording and reporting all outward signs must be habitual with those caring for the dying. Any changes must be understood, evaluated and responded to if appropriate. For example, patients experiencing intense pain may become agitated. The initial thought to use sedatives immediately might make sense if one is not thinking clearly: \"... the patient is agitated, I'll use a sedative...\" However, that may be a very short-sighted and uneducated approach. Why? Because sedating the patient is not the first action to take. One must first determine what other causes might exist. When pain is severe, sedatives will not eliminate agitation! However, relieving the pain eliminates the agitation. On a more basic level, removing a hard object such as a syringe or catheter tubing that may have drifted underneath the patient may be all it takes to relieve the agitation. Common sense must first be applied! The following are examples of questions that nurses and physicians ask themselves as they approach this problem: As the terminally ill near death, body organs and systems begin to fail to a greater and greater degree. Kidneys stop producing as much urine and function poorly, the liver and other organs also start to shut down. Waste products from the cells and tissues of the body begin to build up in the tissue spaces and blood stream. Biological and chemical balance is lost. The pH in the blood and other areas may change dramatically. In many patients, these changes alone may account for restlessness and agitation that may be quite severe. If, and only if, other obvious causes of restlessness and agitation have already been eliminated, then the physician may directly order medications to reduce the restlessness and agitation. In almost all cases, the physician will have written standing orders for certain medications to be given for these conditions. Such medications include anti-anxiety medications such as Lorazepam (Ativan) and Diazepam (Valium) and anti-psychotic medications such as Haloperidol (Haldol), Chlorpromazine HCl (Thorazine) and others. The nurse and physician must be extremely careful not to give a medication that might be contraindicated for the patient's condition. It is not appropriate to give all patients Ativan and Morphine, for example, if they become agitated. It they are in pain, then pain medication is appropriate. If their pain is well-managed and they are still agitated, then the other medications may be applied. Certain disease conditions respond well to these medications while others have an opposite or no effect. Palliative care professionals need to be reading the latest journal articles and research in order to understand when and when not to use these medications. Any nurse or physician who always uses these medications with all patients who are agitated has more to learn about handling these situations. Palliative care varies according to the patient, the disease, the stage of the disease and the exact situation being encountered. Some believe that palliative care is less demanding than say, acute care in the hospital or intensive care. However, that is not the case. Excellent palliative care requires the same degree of professionalism as in other specialties in health care. Constant patient assessment and re-assessment are necessary. Knowledge of the latest treatment modalities and options is a sign of the very best palliative care has to offer. Knowledgeable palliative care professionals will be most effective in managing crisis situations such as terminal agitation. If crisis symptoms are not being well handled by staff at the bedside, it is paramount that the physician be consulted about the best course of action to comfort the patient and relieve his or her distress. Terminal agitation is a hospice crisis and meets the criteria for starting the continuous nursing care level of care. (See Continuous Nursing Care in Hospice).",

I'm afraid there might be progression because she says her left hip is hurting again.  That's what brought her to the doctor and her dx in the first place.  The left hip stopped hurting, and she started feeling pain in the right hip.  She fractured her pelvis in two places, and it doesn't appear to be healing.  Now she's hurting on both sides.  The last time I talked to her onc he said he needed to start watching her liver again.  I want to understand what the different numbers and \"doctor speak\" mean when I see her scan. I really do appreciate your reply. Peggy",

      "Content": "Mar 10, 2010 05:48PM sincitydealer wrote: Here is the article.  Sure sounds promising. Researchers are hoping they've found a new weapon in the war on breast cancer -- freezing tumors. A new study carried out by researchers from the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center found that freezing breast tumors helps stop the spread of cancer in mice. A new clinical trial is underway to evaluate this technique for human patients and could potentially lead to improved survival rates over surgery for breast cancer. Breast cancer is the third leading cause of death for women in the U.S. The University of Michigan study, which appears in the \"Annals of Surgical Oncology,\" looked at two different cryoablation [freezing] techniques. Both involved applying a cold probe to a tumor to freeze it. One entailed the rapid freezing of the tumor (in about 30 seconds) and the other involved freezing the tumor more slowly. The results: the benefit from the rapid freezing is more effective and is likely due to changes in the immune system that help to kill the tumor. Freezing with the slower technique appeared to make the immune system not as able to kill the tumor. Both tests were compared to results from mice that underwent surgery to remove the tumors. Researchers found that the mice treated with the rapid freeze had fewer tumors that spread to the lungs and improved survival compared to mice treated with surgery alone or mice treated with the slower freezing. The good news for breast cancer patients is that this freezing technique has the potential to be a powerful treatment tool for the treatment of breast cancer, says lead study author Michael Sabel M.D., associate professor of surgery at the U-M Medical School. An estimated 192,280 Americans will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year and 40,610 who will die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. \"Cryoablation has strong potential as a treatment for breast cancer,\" says Dr. Sabel. \"Not only does it appear effective in treating the primary tumor with little cosmetic concerns, but it also may stimulate an immune response capable of eradicating any cells that have traveled throughout the body, reducing both local and distant recurrence, similar to giving a breast cancer vaccine.\" But what researchers also learned is that much of the success relies on the technique used to freeze the tumors, which can have \"a significant impact on how the immune system responds,\" says Dr. Sabel. \"The system we use today appears to be ideal for both destroying the tumor within the breast and generating an anti-cancer immune response.\" Cryoablation has also recently reported improved treatment of prostate cancer, and it has been reported to show promise for kidney patients who are not good candidates for surgery, as well as treatment for a variety of cancers that have spread to the liver and bone. Laurence Wagman, M.D., medical director of the Center for Cancer Treatment and Prevention at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California, has used cryoablation for his prostate cancer patients. He found that the freezing of the prostate gland can destroy cancerous cells. \"It has been well-known to physicians that extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, can destroy biological tissues,\" says Dr. Wagman. The University of Michigan researchers are participating in a national clinical trial to evaluate using cryoablation for early stage breast cancer. Participants will undergo rapid freezing of their tumor, and their blood samples will be analyzed to assess changes in their immune system. All participants will be treated three to four weeks later with standard surgery to remove their tumor.",

I wish your Mom much success with her treatments.  It's wonderful that she has you to take care of her. Peggy ",

My Mom just had her PET scan last Wednesday, and we'll get the results this coming Wednesday.  I know how you feel.  The waiting is awful. Peggy",

I hear they're having great success with it in HER2 patients. The side effects can be harsh (diarrhea and rash), but you can always ask for a dose reduction if they're not manageable. One member here, Denny123, was on it for only 8 days, and it knocked the cancer way back! Poziotinib is taken in pill form. This would be another arrow in your quiver if the trial you're currently in doesn't help.",

      "Content": "Oct 18, 2011 04:58PM - edited Oct 18, 2011 05:08PM by sincitydealer My Mom was about 73 when first diagnosed with stage 1 BC.  A lumpectomy and radiation was done and Tamoxifen for 5 years...no chemo.  Seven years later it came back stage lV.  She is now 83 and has done anti-hormonals and 3 different chemos.  They're starting her on Gemzar tomorrow.  All of the chemos have been very tough on her.  Her cancer is in her bones, liver, hilar, and mediastinal lymph nodes.  They are going aggressive with her, but that's the only choice she has other than to do nothing and let nature take its' course. It can be really tricky treating the elderly.  I would think they would consider your Mom's age, stage of BC, and over all general health before deciding which way to go.  It would be ideal if she were ER/PR+ so she could use the more gentle anti-hormonals. If your Mom does have BC, I hope they can use the anti-hormonals.  Chemo can really be rough on the elderly. Peggy",

Robin Roberts, who's on \"Good Morning America,\" has the same thing.  Her Sister was a match, and Robin is doing very well. I hope this helps you some to know what to expect.  If you have any other questions, I'll try to answer them if I can. Peggy",

My Mother wants any kind of treatment that will keep her alive.  She has mets to the bones, liver, and many lymph nodes.  I'm not sure continuing chemo is for the best, but it's her decision.  She has been through at least four different types of chemo treatments that had to be stopped due to very bad side effects.  The last one, Halaven, was discontinued today, so it's on to something else.  The elderly definitely are at a disadvantage when it comes to chemo, too many co-morbid conditions. Is your Mother-In-Law ER/PR+?  If she is, they will most likely start her off on the anti-hormonals.  There's several of those.   They're much gentler than chemo.  If your MIL is HER+, they can give her Herceptin, also better than chemo. Make sure you get a HIPPA form signed by her to include you, for each doc, medical institution, etc.  You have to get this before they'll talk to you about anything. This won't be an easy battle you're undertaking.  In fact, it will probably be the hardest thing you and she will ever go through.  I wish you and your MIL luck. Peggy    ",

Amy, I do believe Quadramet was mentioned.  Thank you sooo much for the information.  I was so stunned with what the doc said all I could do was thank him for his time and hang up.  The fractures are in her pubic area.  She's talked to 3 different doctors, and none of them will do surgery, yet they all told her it was okay to walk on it.  She was using a walker until a couple of weeks ago.  Maybe staying in the wheelchair will help the fractures heal.  I sure hope this procedure will get her out of pain.

Your MIL's docs must think she has life threatening organ mets if they're going to start her right out on chemo.  It's either that, or she is ER/PR- and HER2-.  Thats kind of unusual for somebody her age to not be ER/PR+.  Most elderly women are. I'm so sorry you're going through this.  You have a tough road ahead of you caring for both your husband and MIL.  They are so very lucky to have you. Peggy",

I agree with Bestbird.  See if your Mom is ER/PR+.  If she is, then there's several anti-hormonals she can use.  My Mom was on them in between different chemos until they all failed her, but while she was on them, her quality of life was much better than on chemo. I think the failed chemo that you're talking about is Gemzar, and the second one that your Mom might be trying is Eribulin which has a brand name of Halaven.  So I think they're the same chemo.  I've never heard of Aribulin. Gemzar failed my Mom, also, and her next treatment will be Halaven.  If that's what your Mom will be getting, I'll keep my fingers crossed that it works for both our Mothers. Peggy ",

I guess we caregivers get a little frustrated sometimes, and it shows through in some of our posts as complaining about trivial things when the rest of you are going through so much.  Again, I apologize if I offended you in any way. BTW, I would love to visit Australia.  I love it that you guys are on this forum.  I wish I could visit there like ChrissyB came here. P.S. I don't remember any response you gave to my posts as being negative.  Sometimes the printed word can easily be taken the wrong way because there is no emotion in it, not at all what the writer intended.

Just be there for her.  If she'll sign a Hippa form at her doctor's office, he can discuss her situation with you and you can help with the treatment decisions. Have a happy Mother's Day and let your Mother know how much you care.",

My Mom's first port ended up pressing on a nerve, and they had to take it out.  They installed another one on the other side of her chest, but it didn't do well so they took that one out, too.  She ended up using a picc line for quite a while that worked very well.  They're not as convenient as a port, but there was no need for all that jabbing. I hope they can clear the infection up for you and reinstall the port in another location.  I think of you often, and I hope you can catch a break soon. Peggy",
