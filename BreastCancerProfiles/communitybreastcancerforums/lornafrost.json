My PS declared that he was very pleased with the result & that i should be grateful!!  Long story short... I am due to have revision surgery in NOLA in a couple of weeks!  We have been in contact by phone & e-mail & they have seen photos of my reconstruction.  The central part of the lump seems to have folded over onto itself, and I have been told that it is very likely that the whole thing will have to be scrapped and a GAP done. I consulted 2 different PS in this country who both wanted to insert an implant into the lump in an effort to make it more breast shaped. The thought of adding more bulk to an already uncomfortable lump really does not appeal. I would love to hear what problems you had that required you to have revisions.  Please pm me if you don't wish to publicise it. All the best, Lorna",
