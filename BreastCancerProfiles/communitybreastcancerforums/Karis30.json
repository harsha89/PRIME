Also, follow-up left breast ultrasound is recommended in 6 months. IMPRESSION: 1. There is a 4 mm solid appearing nodule in the left retroareolar region at 3:00 1 cm from the nipple. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended. 2. Additional 4 mm cysts at 10:00 3 cm from the nipple, 1:00 4 cm from the nipple and 3:00 3 cm from the nipple. Follow-up ultrasound is recommended in 6 months. HISTORY: R92.8: OTH ABN AND INCONCLUSIVE FINDINGS ON DX IMAGING OF BREAST Clinical Indications: 1/24/2018 MAMMO BILAT SCREENING: Focal nodular asymmetry in the posterior upper left breast. Recommend ML and XCCL whole breast views, spot compression views and ultrasound examination of the LEFT breast. COMPARISON: January 24, 2018-July 16, 2014 Ordering Provider: WYNETTE G A (M.D.) AMAZONA BREAST DENSITY: The breast tissues are heterogeneously dense, which may obscure small masses. FINDINGS: Left XCCL, ML and MLO spot compression views were performed. There are several faint mostly obscured nodular densities in the upper breast. No architectural distortion or spiculation is seen. There are no suspicious clustered microcalcifications. There are a few faint scattered microcalcifications and coarse calcifications. Left breast ultrasound was performed for further evaluation. There is a 4 x 4 x 3 mm cyst at 10:00 3 cm from the nipple, a 4 x 4 x 3 mm cyst at 1:00 4 cm from the nipple and a 4 x 2 x 5 mm probable complex cyst at 3:00 3 cm from the nipple. There is a 4 x 4 x 3 mm hypoechoic solid-appearing rounded nodule at 3:00 1 cm from the nipple in the retroareolar region. There are surrounding ductal structures. These images are also analyzed using computer-aided detection equipment. Interpreted by: Daniel Henshaw, Log in to post a reply",
