I guess there may be a small question regarding 'concordance' and location, so we'll need to wait for the radiologist's final report to get the final all-clear. (During the biopsy, they told me there were two nearby clusters and tried to set it up so they could sample both at the same time, but neither the first nor second round of core samples showed any calcs in them so that angle missed both spots. They then removed the needle and repositioned it directly on one of the clusters - but round 3 samples showed only 1 or 2 calcs so they had to take a 4th set of samples. At that point, they didn't even try to go back for the other spot - I was pretty much D-O-N-E for anyway.) But at least what they got was totally benign, and hopefully got enough that we are done with this for now! Thank you all so much for your prayers and support! And now I get to have a fun weekend! Hope you all do the same!",

Early next week I'm out of town with one of my kids for an academic competition, and between traveling and the scheduled activities it may be difficult for me to take \"the call\". At any rate, I'm hopeful it's benign - I've had several past biopsies show all kinds of benign fibrocystic stuff, and the radiologist did say it's possible the microcalcs she saw could just be caused by fibrocystic changes. Unfortunately, I've also had a prior biopsy with LCIS and have a strong family history which makes me high risk so I can't completely silence the nagging worry that the odds are going to catch up with me... Either way, I will think of you and pray for you as you move forward with your plan!",

So...got the biopsy pathology report back today.  Two lesions:  one a fibroadenoma, the other atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in situ.  I'm thankful it is not cancer, but still not happy about the potential implications of the LCIS.  Supposed to chat more with my dr about what the plan is moving forward.  Think I'll check out the LCIS board..",

Called back for spot mammo and US on Friday, which led the radiologist to schedule me for biopsy this week. Today I found that I am having two biopsy procedures on the same day - one stereotactic for the density they couldn't see on US, and one US-guided for the mass they found on US (neither one is palpable). Is that normal? I am going to the mammogram center at an NCI-designated cancer center, so I am sure they know what they are doing but I am now more worried about the procedure(s) than before when I thought it was one-and-done. Has anyone else had this? Somehow it feels scarier than just one procedure, even though I guess it's not really any different than taking multiple samples from a single procedure. (Not to mention - not looking forward to getting multiple holes punched in me!) Log in to post a reply",

So I'm right there waiting with you. Hugs and best wishes that all comes back normal for you! Incidentally, in an unrelated benign biopsy from the other breast last year, it looks like pathology report was completed in 2 days but I think my dr waited to call me until the radiologist had also looked at the pathology report and indicated that they agreed the pathology report was 'concordant' with what they saw on imaging (so it took me a week to get my results that time, too).",
