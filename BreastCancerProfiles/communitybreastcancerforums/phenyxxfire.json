    "Content": "phenyxxfire wrote: Hello All, I was referred to a breast specialist a couple of years ago because I have naturally lumpy, cysty breasts. A couple of weeks ago I had a Mammogram and Ultrasound because I was having pain and tenderness on the left side. The mammogram was unusually painful on the left breast and the US showed several simple cysts. I'm not worried about those, but there was one area that looked different. My specialist said it was cystic but \"starting to look a little complex\". I asked him if I should have it biopsied and he said no, he'd just see me for another US in 6 months. He also said there was nothing to worry about, but then why does he want to see me again in 6 months instead of a year? Should I get a second opinion about a possible biopsy now or should I wait until I see my current doc again in July? Of note: I was adopted so I have absolutely no idea if I have a family history of breast cancer. Thanks, Leigh Log in to post a reply",
