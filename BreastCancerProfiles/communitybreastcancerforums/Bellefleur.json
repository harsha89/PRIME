But mine is from nursing. I had ultrasound, mammogram and MRI to make sure and I saw a breast specialist. He explained it as sensitive estrogen receptors that have made ligaments lazy so they aren't doing their job to keep the breast the same contour. It is also only in my one breast. Hope that helps",

Nothing showed up on my mammo or US I just had an MRI but haven't gotten my results from it. I see a breast specialist on the 29th. If you'd like I'll keep you posted about what happens with my appointment. I've had two kids and breast fed them both my GP thinks it might be from that but with a family history of three of my great aunts having breast or ovarian cancer they don't want to chance it. Sorry you are going through this while pregnant. I'd wait till the baby is born so that you can get the best results from testing and keep that sweet thing safe",

It's definitely good to get it checked out but they chances are so small so I hope you take solice in that. Majority of the time if you are pregnant and get these symptoms it is because of the weird chances our bodies go through during pregnancy. Many will go away in a few days or weeks other the only thing that will fix it is having the baby. I hope this help ease your anxiety. And congratulations on your pregnancy. focus on the joy of that to keep your mind off of what your breasts are doing",

Pregnancy really can do a number on our breasts. many women get mastitis as well as fungal or yeast infections on their breasts. I'd say almost all the pregnant women that have come on here worried about IBC have had it come back as B9 and one of those three things. All breast issue should be checked by dr. And if you are a worry wart like me seeing a specialist is really the only way to feel at ease.",

Then said looks good you can go home your doctor will get the report in so many days. Everything was fine I have B9 breast issues so no cancer. So take a deep breath it's very possible the spot you saw was a cyst and the radiologist because of your family history just wanted to get a baseline for future mammograms as you get older. I felt super scared when they did that to me. I felt like what aren't you telling me. I feel it's all good the next why more images?? I think they just don't realize the stress and anxiety we are going through so don't communicate effectively. Hope you get the call soon and that everything is B9",

I have also have had auterine oblation and had emergency gullbladder surgery. I've also had my appendix out and 3 operations on my ankle. So trust me when I say that the gullbladder surgery isn't fun But is a fairly quick recovery just take it easy. It's hard when you feel like you've drawn the genetic short straw but I just remember you only get what you can handle therefore you must be stronger than you realize",
