Anyway, on the other threads I wrote that I've been getting sicker since my last chemo in October  2010.  All the symptoms listed, and lately I've been snapping at my friends!  Frustration x 10000! I eat well, take plenty of vitamins and walk my foster dog 3x a day.  I should be fine.  NOT !      D*** F**ing Cancer. Many specialists, many mri's, blood tests, exams, xrays, etc, etc all came back negative.  I can't work, sleep, walk or have a sensible conversation.  I'm not getting smarter, like you are !!  Anyway, I saw my pcp again to review all the newest negative tests and she reluctantly said that its not on most doctor's radar, but adrenal fatigue can cause all my problems.  Thyroid can contribute but not necessarily the cause.  Mine is .90 (.40 - 4.5 mlU/L) so lowish, but not alarming.  My temp runs 96.0 - 97.6.  No dr has EVER mentioned it being a problem.  I used to run 99.6 in my teens. ok, getting to the point,my doctor said the elements show up in my blood tests, but may not be synthesizing to assist in bodily functions.    I ordered the special formula of vitamins/minerals/electrolytes and the adrenal gland essence w/o hormones.  I only know something is missing, and I am sick.  I am working on getting my temp up w/staying warmer, lying in the sun and imagining my temp going up, hot coffee and no icy cold drinks.  I never liked them cold anyway. Oh yeah, she also gave me a B-12 shot and I feel more energetic.  I can have them weekly if they help. Let's keep supporting each other and hopefully all get to feeling wonderful and enjoying life again!  ",

It colored the gray.  It washes out each time. I don't think your hair has stopped growing...it just doesn't look like it.  All of sudden, bam!  You will see length and evryone else will notice too. I think mine started looking like less bald after 4 months. Its just the way some of us do it.  MBJ has also mentioned several products that encourage hair growth if you have the $ and want to give it a try!  I know how important the hair is....after everything we've been thru, now we have to gaze at this strange person with your name in the mirror. I had to stay away from mirrors for 2 months...it was upsetting.  Denial works short term!!",

What a freaking relief!  I lost my hair in May, so its been 11 months of feeling and looking weird.  Such a relief to joing the general population again. My hair went from straight blonde bob to wavy brown/gray pixie, so no, I don't look like 'myself;, but at leasts I'm 'here'. Oh yeah, I dyed it red~  Then brown~ and heading back to blonde asap!  So, there is life after hair loss, ladies!!  6 months...maybe a little more, maybe a little less...but having a definitive time frame makes it easier to get thru it I think.  Like finally knowing what is making you sick...so you can plan to get well.  Just be patient...it will happen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I think the hair thing was one of the bravest things I did the last year.  Congratulations to us ALL.   My foobs are still as annoying as hell 9 months later, but that's another thread...   ",
