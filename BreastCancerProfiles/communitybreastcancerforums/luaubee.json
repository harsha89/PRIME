Swelling and ribs feeling a bit out of place due to what I am pretty sure is truncal lymphedema. Dbl mastectomy due to DCIS no recon and not being taken seriously by my primary care at all after 24 months. Feels like there is a catchers mitt shoved into my rib cage on the side the surgeon took a very large lymph node! As I read this thread I see discussion of costochondritis and I too have wondered if that was also involved since I still sometimes get a bruised feeling over the sternum. The frustration of not being able to lift, carry of complete what were once easy normal tasks is madding, I really do understand and feel for you on that count . I do vintage and antique restoration and sales myself and have had to cut back to only handling smalls and even then it can be too much. Hope everything went well with your biopsie and you have informative results.",

I recall warm/hot baths and the heating pad helped too. Oddly enough I just spoke to my yoga class instructor about returning to classes in the New Year and she pointed me toward 2 of their gentle recovery Yin Yoga sessions. I miss my regular exercise and really want to get back at it! ",

I did read about Costochondritus (because the internet is here to feed my fear and over-thinking issues!) and with the surgery and the old calcification that is a real possibility. This dull ache is low level but tiresome and to a point of exhausting some days. I know it is still early days for healing but this came as a surprise, nobody ever said \"oh, by the way your lower ribs might ache for weeks after a month or so!\" Again, my thanks ladies for the ideas and advice, so glad I finally decided to sign in!

      "Content": "luaubee wrote: Hi, very new here, thanks in advance for being here. I have been reading and lurking since late August just before my Bilateral Mastectomy without reconstruction. I now have a question on weather anyone else has felt this: a dull lower rib cage ache ? It began at about 6 weeks after surgery on the cancer. single node removal side and I had been feeling great, did a little weed pulling and moved a couple things I probably should not have (around 15 lbs). This was 17 days ago and it still feels the same. Feels like the rib muscles are pulling/sometimes rippling over the last 3-4 ribs directly under the scar in a space the size of my hand. Dull ache, not changing much or going away. I freaked out and went to urgent care after 2 days of Aleve not fixing it and they took x-rays which showed clear lungs and old calcification on those ribs, the doctor checked my urine (fine no kidney or bladder issue) and since I was sure my liver/gallbladder/pancreas were about to want out he also checked and found no tenderness in those areas including WAY up under the rib to reach the gallbladder. Apparently no scream of pain means it probably isn't any of those. No jaundice, no vomiting, bowels regular. He said to take anti-inflammatories round the clock for a few weeks apply ice/heat and let it settle down. I was not convinced and it still ached and I went to my primary care who said all the same things and said I should see my BS since I already had an appt the next week. Surgeon thinks it is muscles too and said they should settle down in a few weeks or months! UGH! I know I over think these things but I just wondered if this was common at all or if I should shout until I get an ultra-sound to actually rule out organ involvement? If anyone else has experienced this how long was it until it lessened or even went away? I was doing SO good for 6 weeks now this! Thanks!

That IS the area from bottom of scar to bottom of rib but I just felt it really well and even checked the mirror, no cord apparent but there are a few new teeny tiny veins visible that I haven't seen or perhaps noticed before. The area is smooth just a little swollen all over. I should note that my incision scar is still in the process of un-swelling and the underarm/ side boob fat is also still falling/wandering searching for a place to settle since it has no front attachment anymore. Maybe that is all this while thing is, I really hope so and that it is just gravity affecting the wandering side fat.",
