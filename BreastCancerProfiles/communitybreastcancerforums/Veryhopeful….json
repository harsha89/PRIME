Any possibility of an infection?",

(my sister)  She never bothered to call and find out the result.  Well, yes, she called 3 months later.  I said, \"You know, it's not the flu\" and I cried.  And it still bothers me that it was so insignificant to them.  Oh, and I NEVER heard from my in-laws  EVER - no card no phone call - nothing.  And my husband never stood up for me and said anything.  That hurt most of all. Sorry to go on and on....  So those of you that have great family support - cherish it.",
