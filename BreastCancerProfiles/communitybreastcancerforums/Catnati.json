I used cold cap and have so far not lost any hair! Side effects were tough but I kept working and I also managed to go on a Busines trip ... just brought a lot of drugs and wore a mask on the plane. This community has been amazing and I gained many ideas of how to push through this (hopefully with my hair) in the most sane manner possible and with managing side effects. I am curious if people who used cold caps through 4xTC managed to kept most of the hair?",
