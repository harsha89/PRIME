I went to a wig shop and got a wig for around 400.00. The woman there was wonderful, and I also brought a good friend of mine who makes me laugh to pick one out. She trimmed it for me, and she really made it look like me. I have received tons of compliments about the wig....people think it is my own hair. That being said....I wear it only to work, restaurants, or to church. Otherwise at home...bare. Outside, shopping, ball game, I wear ball caps or a skull cap. As soon as I walk in my house from work, I take off the wig. It is so hot during the summer and I hate wearing it. But it looks real, it really isn't uncomfortable, and I don't worry about what others think when  I wear it. I miss my own hair. My big suggestion is to cut your hair shorter if your hair is long before you start chemo or right after you start. Once it starts falling out, it comes out in clumps which is really hard to deal with. I cut it very short after it started doing this, and then a couple of days later had my sil shave it for me. It was hard, but I was glad that I was in control of when my hair came out. Good luck to you....it is a difficult part of the process or at least for me it was.  ",

I think the thing to consider is if you plan on working, and then try to arrange your schedule around this. My onc had me go on thur the first time, but then I felt horrible on the following Monday and 1/2 tuesday. I now have tx on Wed, work Thur and Friday. Sleep all day Sat and Sund with meals, and then start rebounding Mon pm. So I am only taking the extra Monday off. That being said it does have a cumulative effective, and the more txs the harder it hits. The fatigue is what bothers me the most, but after the full week...you start to fill so much better and normal which is awesome! I think that is the thing to remember, that all of the s.e. are temporary and they will go away. I was terrified the first time as I could not concentrate on anything, but that was also due to a lack of sleep due to the steriods. Be sure to get something to sleep. The taste sensations is disgusting because it tastes like you have been sucking on metal constantly....but that does go away as well. EAting with plastic forks/spoons also helps. I didn't get a choice by my onc...told this was the most aggressive tx and needed because of sister death to bc, age, and family history with cancer, as well as the grade, and lymph node. Best of luck with your decision....it is a difficult journey anyway that you go but it is good to know that you do everything that you can.  ",

After my first tx, I felt bad on the Sunday through Tuesday after even though my treatment was on Thursday.

Hopefully this works.   Day 14 today, and I am worried about my hair. My hair/head feels a little odd and I am having trouble sleeping. I am actually worried that I will wake up with hair all over. Is that crazy? Like others I am starting to notice other people's hair. I work in downtown Chicago, and yesterday 4 of the approx 100 people I saw walking to work were bald and all men.  KristyAnn, I have a cousin going through chemo and she advised taking 3-4 Ibuprofen before the Neulasta shot to reduce bone pain.

The docs kind of dismissed her, and she has not had complications from her lungs because of the chemo drugs. It was pretty rare that happened since she had only dx before it started. Just be careful, and if it continues be sure to follow up with the doc. She ended up in the hospital a couple of times, and they had to change her chemo meds. Eddie, that is crazy. Why don't they let you take the IV pole with you? And thanks for bringing up the hair issue...I am going through the same thing. My hair looks like crap though....kind of dead and lifeless so to speak:) ",

I kind of feel the same way, but I think sometimes people will say stuff because they really want it to work out well for you and so if they say oh it will be fine, it will be.  Not that it makes you feel any better. My MIL said to me last weekend, oh my brother said your hair isn't that short. Seriously about 2 inches long and it used to go to past my shoulders. It was odd...and why tell me. Other people said well you're haircut will be so cool for the summer. Sure it will be cool for another 3 or 4 days until all of my hair falls out!  Whatever. I did tx 2 on Wednesday and it was okay. A little more nauseous and severely bloated....I guess all the saline. Don't really know. However better in that I knew what I was getting you know? I knew I would be a little buzzy and fuzzy which was so much better than not knowing.  ",

I took the test and it came out negative. My other sister went to the doctor and after talking to a genetic counselor the recommendation was that she did not need to take the test as it was negative for me. Now, they do think that there are some other type of genetic issues, but they don't have the research to say what other gene to look at. I don't know; it's frustrating. Good luck with your family!",
