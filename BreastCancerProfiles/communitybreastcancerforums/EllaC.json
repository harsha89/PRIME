Bye!\". I did ask what is it, but she was in such a hurry that I did not fully understand. Anyhow, I asked for the report to be sent to me. It is finally here and it says \"nonproliferative fibrocystic change showing focally prominent stromal fibrosis\". I have no clue what it means (of course I Google it). I had an appointment with my GYN doctor and she said \"do not worry, it is nothing\". But I am still worried. Should I ask for a second opinion?",

I needed to dress the wound and change the strips the next day. After about 5-6 hours I had a terrible shoulder pain, but I decided to go to sleep and forget about it. In the meantime, I received my results. It is \"non-proliferative fibrocystic change showing focally prominent stromal fibrosis\". They said that is benign and I should not worry, go back in 1 year for regular 3D mammogram. I hope you all get good results!",

My US did not show the AD, or any other mass, ductal inflammation, no lump to be felt, etc. So, the radiologist said I must have the biopsy to rule out/confirm cancer. He did not mention MRI to me, but I would have probably refuse it due to too much radiation, plus for dense heterogeneous breasts it does not give that great of results.",

Would you please share your own experience with the biopsy?",

I eventually called the hospital and they were nice enough to transfer me to a technician and she told me that I will have a core needle biopsy that is vacuum assisted, meaning only one insertion but multiple samples will be taken. I got to stay off the internet/Google, there is too much info and some is conflicting. Thank you again!",
