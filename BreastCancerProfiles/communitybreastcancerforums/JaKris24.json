I went to urgent care November 18th and they did an EKG. The EKG was fine but they were sent me to the ER just because of the chest pain. I was admitted for observation and had a stress test the following day. Everything with my heart checked out so I was released Nov 19th. November 21st I went back to the ER with armpit pain and chest pain again. They checked me for a blood clot. That was not the issue either. This time they sent me home with a prescription of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory and GERD medicine. November 23rd I saw my primary care doctor still in excruciating pain under the arm along with swelling beside the breast. My doctor gave me pain medicine and told me to rest in case I pulled a muscle. November 24 I went to a different ER. I am hurting for some reason and no one can tell me why. I am taking all the prescribed medications and nothing is helping. The ER doctor asked how long I had been having the pain under my arm. I first noticed sharp shooting pains under the arm on Aug 18th. I was getting ready for my 30 year class reunion. At that time it would come and go. Over the last few weeks the pain had become more often and been more persistent. It never ceases now. Not even with pain pills. My mom had breast cancer. My question or worry is could this pain under my arm be cancer? I'm in agony and don't know which way to turn. My doctor finally referred me to an oncologist. I will see them Dec 6th. But I haven't had a biopsy or anything. Has anyone else experienced anything like this",
