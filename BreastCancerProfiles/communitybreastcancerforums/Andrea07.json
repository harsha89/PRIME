Please, please help me get some GOOD stories about girls who have walked this same path.  I really need something positive to hold onto so that I don't let fear take over.   How do you keep your focus on the good and not the \"ugly\".  Any advice would really be appreciated by this nervous mom.  I want to be here to see these guys turn into men.....and it makes me so sad to worry that I might not.  Thank you so much.
