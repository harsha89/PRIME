Needless to say, I have a sore boob, especially since it has hasn't exactly gotten fresh air since the boob itself is flopping over the incision. When I was 20 I didn't have a problem like pancake boobs! Ha! Ice has helped a lot. The people at the surgery center were amazing. Overall, I'd say the worst part was the 5 week wait. Everything else has been pretty smooth. Should get results in a couple days, but surgeon told the husband it looked like healthy tissue. Yay! Glad it's over and wanted to send some positive, loving thoughts to everyone here. Peace and happiness to you. Xoxo Log in to post a reply",
