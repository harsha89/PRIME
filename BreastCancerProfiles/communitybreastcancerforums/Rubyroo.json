She told me my score, then asked what my 'gut feeling' was. I have truly gotten the sense that this will ultimately come down to a personal preference on my part, since as you mention there is no guarantee. When pushed, my oncologist is still recommending chemotherapy, but she has not been adamant about this and has suggested that I will have the final say as there is no real consensus. Please share what your new onc says with me! Feel free to PM me anytime. It feels like we're in the same boat (albeit not a very nice one...) MTwoman - thank you for your warm thoughts. I'm going to go ask to speak to a counsellor or nurse navigator - I am sure they have told me about them but things have been so overwhelming since my initial diagnosis that I can't keep anyone straight. Before now, my path with surgery and testing has been relatively clear, but now that I am in a real decision-making conundrum I'll look into more resources for support and guidance.

I am not typically a person who makes these kinds of decisions based on emotional motivation (unfortunately!!) hence I have been poring over the data - both external and my own unique case. MTWoman - Thanks again, I have reached out to the social worker in the oncology department to be connected to possible resources and support. BarredOwl - I have been reading a LOT of your previous posts and am grateful for your detailed response to my own question! I just actually received my full Oncotype report print out today. I was sent home yesterday with only a summary page. You're right, the first graph on the report has my score as 25, with a recurrence risk of 16% with Tamoxifen for 5 years alone. My confusion stems from an additional page that was provided to me, which provided a combined risk that considered my Oncotype score, age, tumour size, node status and hormone receptors (if I recall all this correctly - I don't currently have that page with me here at work so I can't confirm). Essentially my understanding is this additional summary page calculates my overall risks combining the Oncotype score and the risk that can be observed through my clinical pathology report. Based on this, (my age being 31, my tumour size being 1 cm - though this is based on the largest tumour, as I had a total of 4 tumours removed, being ER/PR+ and node negative) resulted in a score of 11%. Thus, my confusion about how to know whether to base my decision on my risk of recurrence calculated purely from the Oncotype genomic assay test (16%) or to take the other factors into account (11%). If my risk was truly 16%, this would perhaps sway me more into the chemo category. Interestingly, the first graph (Prognosis: 10-Year Risk of Distant Recurrence with Tamo) has me positioned at my recurrence score of 25 and a 10-Yr risk of 16%, while the second graph (Prediction of Chemo Benefit after 5 Years of Tam) has my recurrence score result still at 25 but with a 10-Yr risk of 11% with Tam alone and at 7% with chemo+Tam). So my question remains - am I currently at 16% or 11%?? I understand the additional complication regarding delaying rads and hormone therapy due to my pregnancy. When I asked my MO about this, she said that the rads take care of local recurrence and don't play as much of a factor when thinking about distant recurrence. In terms of Tamoxifen, she said the Oncotype study considered hormone therapy given at various stages of treatment, and didn't seem to think that the delay in my own situation would make much of an impact on my scores. So I am still hesitant to put my body through chemo, rads and hormone therapy while pregnant and then while adjusting to life with a newborn. The tumour board will assess my case with this new information, and I have contacted my family doctor to inquire about a second opinion from another oncologist. I am hoping to get other options/possible pathways if possible as I do feel quite a bit of pressure right now (my MO kept mentioning she could start me on chemo as early as next Thursday) and I am not feeling confident about either choice. Since the more research and reading I do, the more the answer seems to be quite muddy (the word 'crapshoot' comes to mind often), it seems more apparent that there is no real good answer. I am leaning towards skipping chemo so as to not have to worry about other longterm effects, secondary cancers, and losing my ability to really enjoy this special time in my life...but again, I'm still very much on the fence and not sure if there will be a magic piece of information that will help me convinced about either decision. All insights and other experiences are quite helpful to me, as I think the anecdotal evidence under these circumstances are as equally varied and compelling as the existing research!",

My onc did not like the idea of delay re: chemo as she says chemo is optimal within 12 weeks of surgery. My lumpectomy was done in May, so I am now wondering about delaying chemo until perhaps July so that the babe is exposed to less. I'll be asking about all this in my next appointment! BarredOwl - So I've figured it out! I asked for a full copy of my report yesterday and finally mulled it over. The score of 11% I received (and what was mostly discussed during my appointment) was done through the RSPC (Recurrence Score - Pathology - Clinical) which appears to be an additional tool that OncotypeDX offers. It is not a part of my 'official' report. There is a PDF about it on the Oncotype site - I found it by googling but I can't seem to post a reasonable link to it here, sorry. I also found a few short papers discussing the use of the tool, including this one: http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/record/96857/poster The conclusion seems to be that the RSPC tool does not alter the assessed benefit of chemo for Oncotype score patients, but it goes regroup about 30% of intermediate scores as low-risk when taking into account clinical factors along with the pathological findings of the test itself. I guess this is why my risk became 11% when the RSPC tool was used. It can be used to 'refine' the understanding of the recurrence risk for intermediate scores. I think this means that it does not change the score I received based on the purely biological behavour of my tumour that my Oncotype score represents, but helps to interpret it in light of the other factors involved. I also assume that my MO wanted me to consider the RSPC's 11% score over the 16%, as she initially only gave me the summary page containing the Oncotype score of 25 and my RSPC score of 11%. So I did not even know about the 16% at my initial appointment. Still unsure which score to place a greater weight on...has anyone else been given their RSPC score? ",
