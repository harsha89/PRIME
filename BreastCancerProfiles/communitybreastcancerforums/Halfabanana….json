The center was built with her at the helm. She is quoted several times in Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. She has a very calm manner, is highly skilled, and I cannot recommend her highly enough. Best of luck in your search!Â ",

Perhaps it was due to my age, 52 at the time, and in menopause. I had a UMX, no rads, and have been on Arimidex for 2 years. I was told that the benefit of chemo in my situation would be minimal, and outweighed by potentially harmful side effects. It seems there are many varied medical opinions out there.",
