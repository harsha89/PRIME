Not yet having the specs or a set plan is really tough. The BC data is like drinking from a firehouse even when you limit it to only your own type. You will know soon. And you have no control over what the results will be. Try to breathe and consider anxiety meds - they've helped a bunch of us on here. Know that once you know what type you are, you'll be able to research lots and develop your treatment plan with your medical team,. when I was going through the mammogram callback phase, and told my mom, she wanted me to have surgery immediately, fearing that cancer was spreading. She actually called a surgeon to make me an appt., for me before we even knew it was cancer. It made me mad she assumed the worst and was interfering, but glad she cared so much. and I was just plain scared. But the ladies here are right. It took a long time to grow and taking time now to devise the best team and best plan for you is very important. It's a journey and if Popsicles help, have them",

My MO said that 4 rounds was enough for me - given my toxic rxn to it . I was hospitalized multiple times from it. And my premed list was the same as yours. There was a study published last Dec. showing that early stage patients were 98% disease free at the 3yr mark after having only Taxol. My MO said that my 4 rounds of TC gave me more than that. So, don't feel like you failed chemo. You didn't! When it was too toxic for me, my MO said he wouldn't give me any more even if I asked for it. I couldn't fathom asking for more. It was bad and I understand how you feel. The good news is that it gets better and you likely got more than enough. Check out the study - they presented in San Antonio last year. Your stats fit right within the test group posting the great results. Hugs!",

For me, they first removed Perjeta. Then they changed out the type of taxane. Finally, they took out all taxanes and the carboplatin. This took me down to Herceptin alone, but only after a complete break to try to heal me enough to tolerate it. I was worried that I had not had enough treatment, but my oncologist said that it had to be enough for me, since I could tolerate no more. The other piece of helpful advice was that he posed the question as to why do they normally go with 6 rounds, or 4+4...because that it the way that they did it in whatever trial preceded it becoming the standard of care. He next asked - could more than that course of treatment or less than that course of treatment work? And answered - It's quite possible, but if there hasn't been a study on it, we don't have the definitive data for it. But that this does not mean that it is not effective. Since each person responds differently to treatments, variations from the norm take place all the time, particularly having to add in extra time to the schedule when a patient's body is not yet ready for the next round.",

This is new and I have not been able to find data on Perjeta SEs elsewhere on the Boards.  It was recommended that I post here, as more Stage 4's may have had experience with Perjeta. I'm having a nasty face rash that appears as either chemical burns or angry red bumps. It morphs to open wounds, scabs, and eventually dry skin, it is accompanied by bright red hot cheeks ( hot to the touch but no fever) and red hot ears. Perjeta rep said mild rash is an SE and rare to have serious rash, has anyone else had this SE fr Perjeta? (It's not enough to make me want to stop the targeted drug, but I'm not sure how to treat it and whether it gets worse or is scarring, I'm about to have round 2 of chemo). Thank you for any intel. ",

It fades. It gets much better. Getting the drains out helps a lot! Most people are afraid of chemo. You are not alone. The thought of putting something that toxic through your body is scarey. And not knowing exactly what to expect before the first time is torture. I sat in my MO's office balling my eyes out telling him that I couldn't do it, just before we did it. You can do it. When I had bad SEs, I kept imagining that is was because the chemo was looking for cancer to attack but couldn't find any. Agreed that you should tell your MO even about the smallest SE, and do not hesitate to do so during an infusion or calling them at 2am if you need to. Sometimes a SE means more than you realize. Plus, they usually can do something to make it better. Losing your hair is a huge deal at first, but even that fades. I invested in a bunch of hats and wigs to feel in control before I lost my hair, and found that headcovers.com had a great assortment. I didn't want to cut my long hair short for the \"cancer hair cut\" so instead waited until it began coming out in the shower and had my brother shave my head. My MO asked me if I was trying to make a statement when he saw me, as he thought that I wouldn't lose my hair for awhile yet. Maybe I did it before I needed to, but the important part was that I waited until I was ready. Then I found myself going bald many days, after swearing I'd never do so. Chemo is not easy, but you will be amazed at how strong you are. Your mindset is important. But I agree, even though this is life saving stuff, it still seems unfair that they cut off your boobs, then you lose your hair, and with my chemo steroids I gained weight. Cancer sure felt ugly. But it does get better. You will make it to the other side and learn new things about your inner strength. Last word of advice - pamper yourself whenever given the opportunity. A hand rub, a new lotion, a bath, marathons on Netflix, someone offering to make dinner for your family... Take the opportunities without guilt, as you will need them and can pay it forward in the future. Our support will be with you the whole way. ",

At each stage of my mammogram call back and biopsy, I kept reminding myself that something like 90% of the time, it is not cancer. I hope that all of you are in that majority group. I had not seen anything suspicious, nor had my OB. The mass was discovered during my baseline mammogram. I had felt fine up until then, apart from something being off in my body in a general sense. But the worry of a possible diagnosis made me question every little ache - even a hang nail became suspicious. The anxiety can be overwhelming. I found myself collapsing down on the floor in Books a Million in the children's books (I had been holiday shopping for my daughter), and unable to move for a good half hour, overwhelmed with everything. I barely remember most of last year's holidays - I was so terrified that it is all a blur. I understand your fears, worries and it is not easy. The only thing that helped me (apart from the anti-anxiety meds and sleeping meds that there given to me for my \"cancer has caused anxiety\" diagnosis), was information. I got and continue to get a lot of information from this site, as well as reading about treatment studies on NIH and in medical journals. I felt that by researching, I was taking at least some control over a terrifying situation. My research allowed me to make informed decisions and even help choose my treatment plan, even from the type of biopsy that I wanted to have. Since I had no control over the cancer (and was completely blind sided by it with having no risk factors), this at least was something that I could control. This community is a good resource for venting to those who understand, as well! Best of luck to all of you - may you be in the clear.",
