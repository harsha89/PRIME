I know it's a lot of work and takes a lot of energy to put this on. I hope you can take a few days to enjoy this special time. I too hate reading about the young women with little children dying from this disease. Young or old, families are robbed by this thief. Cancer is relentless and picks no favorites....young, old, rich or poor...I wish more research money was put into metastatic cancer to figure out what drives it, how and why it moves quickly and how to stop it. In the meantime, we keep pushing...and we remember. My friends and family have no idea what it's like to hear every week that another woman (or several) has died. Yes we cry on the inside and smile on the outside...and we remember them. On the good news side, I\u2019m happy to report that we found a house to rent that is 10 minutes from my DD place. We have less than 3 weeks and then moving day back to the west coast. I just had Taxol#15 on Friday and feel pretty good, fingers crossed this drug keeps working. I love reading about all your adventures and challenges. You are becoming my online family. Pot ",

I/F kept the abdominal tumour stable but didn't stop/slow the growth of the lung nodules. It felt very weird to not have any treatment for the month that I was off. By the end of the month, I felt like a ticking time bomb...I was so relieved to start chemo. Crazy how this disease/treatment plays with our mind. Tonight I\u2019m living the dream and the reason why we moved back to the west coast....I\u2019m babysitting my grandson! I got to play with him, bathe him, read him stories and put him to bed all on my own. He\u2019s 11 months old now and absolutely precious. I\u2019m still exhausted from packing up the old house. I got the keys to the new place yesterday. My body is screaming at me to stop, rest more; my brain is busy planning where the furniture will go, what art will look nice on the wall, how on earth am I going to clean this place...it desperately needs a deep clean, what plants would look nice in my new to me plant pots. And on it goes. Micmel, I love your saying about being in our pockets when we have something scary, nasty, worrying going on. It warms my heart. I meet the new MO on Tuesday for a consult so please come along in my pocket. I don\u2019t know my way around the cancer care system here so it will all be new. I\u2019m hoping she also has the rest of the CT results from 2 weeks ago. Be well.",

We have packers coming on Tuesday to pack all the dishes, art, glass and anything else not in a box. I had Taxol #17, the last of the 3 week cycle, on Friday and today I'm feeling exhausted, weepy, and overwhelmed....I call it being in the \u201ctank\". Tomorrow i'll Start crawling back out and hope for more energy....oh and yes the packing goes on, we're about 85% done. I have a friend helping me...DH and I are ready to kill each other. Lol. I have a new MO set up now and continuing taxol pre-booked...so my anxiety and fear went way down over my Care. I meet the new MO on Sept 4. My CT abdomen shows the \u201cthingy\u201d is stable, waiting for news on the long nodules. Micmel, please consider asking your MO to get the Hospital Anxiety and Depression test. I did it with my social worker at psychosocial oncology unit in July after I was an emotional mess in June. It was really helpful in giving me the markers to know how close I am to falling into depression or when things aren\u2019t ok. Ibrance does grind you down, I found the fatigue was especially tough and unpredictable. On a happy news front, we met our youngest sons girlfriend today. She is lovely and I can see that she would be a perfect match for him. Fingers crossed. I so want to see him settled. I was so very sorry to ready the news about keetmom and lalalady....this disease is relentless, doesn\u2019t stop and doesn\u2019t care. Micmel. I\u2019m in your pocket tomorrow, keeping you company. Let me know what the drive is like......Sending warm hugs to all of you, I try to keep up with the posts. You\u2019re my rock.",

I was diagnosed with MBC in May 2017 after being \u201cclear\" for almost 4 years. I remember being in shock when I got the phone call at work from MO that I had a \u201cthingy\u201d in my sub-abdomen...yes it\u2019s in an odd place. I wanted to run as far and fast as I could to get away from the cancer. I started Ibrance and Faslodex in June 2017 with such hope and thought I would keep working, that I could manage this, that the drugs were the newest and best. By fall 2017 I could feel that it was getting harder to keep working, it took way more effort to keep up, the fatigue was noticeable. To stop working was one of the hardest decisions I've made, I had moved across the country in 2010 for my dream job. I stopped working in Dec 2017 and am on LTD. By Xmas the MO thought I had another progression, this time specks in my lungs were growing and turning into something worrying. By March they were big enough to biopsy. Eeek! Now I have cancer in 2 places, still the same cancer. Back into chemo....i just finished Taxol#14, three weeks on one week off, and so far it's been shrinking the tumours. I'm due for CT scans at the end of August. Taxol kicks my butt for sure, the neuropathy is noticeable in my feet now. Three more chemo booked for August. Not sure how many more after that. I'm 63, have three \u201ckids\" (daughter 36, son 34 and son 32); i've been married for 45 years next weekend. DH drives me crazy and is also my best friend. He retired in January. I love doing Pottery...working with clay at the community studio is what keeps me sane...I have One adorable grandson. AND we are moving back across the country at the end on August to be with DD and grandson and DS and wife....and to get away from the nasty winters here. If we don't move now, i'm Afraid I won't be able to do it next year. I have a great friend helping with the sorting, purging, packing; DH and I have purged....going through old photos and papers was the worst. Letting go of stuff has been hard but it will cost us a dollar a pound to move it!!! More than anything, I wanted my stuff and the kids stuf organized so that if something happens to me then things are in order. DH wouldn\u2019t be able to do this on his own and I didn\u2019t want to leave a mess for my kids.",

We've been house hunting and helping DD with grandson and her move. I must say that being with my grand baby gives me an energy high. I hadn't been walking much or doing much for exercise since i started Taxol so I feel like I'm in baby bootcamp....up/down off the floor, picking him up and down, playing peekaboo. It is awesome but OMG I\u2019m exhausted by the end of the day, not complaining just thrilled that I can do this. For brief moments I even feel terrific (well better than I have for 4 months) so fingers crossed the Taxol is working. Micmel, do you still have a stupid cough leftover from the virus/ cold you had? I\u2019ve been coughing for a month now.....grr. Illimae, leaving work is hard. I couldn\u2019t sleep well for about a month after, my brain wouldn\u2019t quit acting like tomorrow was a workday, what are the things I neeed to do, etc. I hope they leave you alone so that you can decompresss. The best thing about not working is Monday mornings...you can stay in bed and your colleagues, poor suckers, can\u2019t!!! I love how you share your lives on this site...I would love to see shower pics, Reno, etc. When we find a place to live, i\u2019ll Post some photos too. Big hugs to you all and be well. ",
