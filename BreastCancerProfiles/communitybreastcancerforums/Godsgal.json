Then one day I was going to the bus stop on my way to work and as I crossed the sidewalk, a wells fargo truck struck me on my right side and I was forced to go to the hospital to get checked.. and my cancer was found.. This was 3 months after my DH had recovered from a breast cancer of his own...and if he and I stand face to face, our scars touch and are in the same place.   A year earlier, we both had gotten baptised and joined our church as a married couple..  I guess satan was really angry because we found the LORD... Or GOD was preparing my husband's understanding as it relates to breast cancer and me.. Either way, I'm still alive and doing well... my cancer seems to be slow growing and I pray that it stays that way.. So I guess early detection does have its benefits.. Hattie Bee Lee (Believe)",
