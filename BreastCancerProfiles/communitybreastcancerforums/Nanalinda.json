I worked as an RN for 25 years and found it very difficult to stop working... it was more than a job, it was a calling.  I have been off work now for nearly 2 years, and feel I did make the right decision as I can put all of my energy into fighting this disease and spending time with my family.  I hope you will be able to find the same peace in staying home that I have.  You are a true warrior, and a great person and I hope the best for you.  Go Gemzar!!",

Now I am no longer working, so it is a non-issue, but I still wonder.  I guess it isn't so much a regret as a \"I wonder if\" issue. Some regrets I do have:  I wish I had taken better care of my health when I was younger;  I wish I hadn't smoked when I did (although there is no correlation between smoking and BC);  I wish I hadn't worked night shift all those years (increases risk of cancer).

I had the positive attitude and it did nothing to protect me.  Now that I have mets, I too try to live in denial, but when we lose another sister, that denial is ripped away from me and I am reminded that I too am dying.  I have been living with mets for a little over a year now, and I have not yet had a good PET and it scares the shit out of me.  I always wonder \"how long do I have?\"  I too hope that I can make it to that 5 year mark or longer, and I hope all of my sisters on this board do too.  That is a lot to hope for, but hope is the one thing that keeps me from the depths of depression.  This is the only board I really feel comfortable in because everyone else here is dealing with the same fear that I live with.  I try to go over to the triple negative board, but it is right now so full of the \"stay positive\" \"rah rah rah\" posts, that I don't feel I can post there for fear of bringing them down.  I just ask that we don't have to see \"stay positive\" on our stage IV board.  It is so inappropriate.  No, konakat:  you are not a bitch.... you are frightened, just like the rest of us. ",

I hate cancer, and I hate what it is doing to my family.  So now we get to wait to see what the PET will show, and I am sure we will be changing chemo again once we find out what we are dealing with.  Take care everyone.  Linda Dx 7/26/2006, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "Nanalinda wrote: I want to tell you a tale that is a little creepy, but it is a true story. I was working as an RN at a small hospital in my home town. I began working as the hospital Infection Control Nurse in 1998, which involved getting my own office on the 3rd floor of the hospital in an area that used to be patient rooms. In 1999 one of our secretaries developed Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (she was 29), and she passed away that year. In 2002, another one of our secretaries developed breast cancer, she was treated for it and is doing fine now. In 2005, my boss, who was the Medical Director of the hospital (family practice physician), 54 and a health nut all her life, a vegetarian since she was 20; was dx with stage 4 colon cancer. She passed away in 2008. I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, and mets in 2008. A man who worked on the same floor, and just a few offices down from us, was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2007; the kind you get from smoking, but he had never had a cigarette in his life. His treatment nearly killed him, but he survived and is still suffering side effects from the rads he underwent. So, out of the 7 of us that worked on that floor; 5 developed cancer, and two died from it (I will most likely succumb from my cancer eventually). They eventually moved us all off that floor in to new offices, and brought in \"experts\" to do air testing which found nothing unusual. So was it all just a terrible coincidence or was there something on that floor causing the cancers? We will never know. I try not to dwell in the past, but we all wonder what may have caused our cancer, and I still wonder some times if I would have gotten it still if I had not worked on that floor for so many years. They have since put a physician office practice up on that floor of the hospital, and as far as I know, no one else has been diagnosed with cancer up there. Does anyone else have a story to tell that may explain the cause of their cancer? Linda Dx 7/26/2006, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",

Have you made a difference in someones life?  A friend, family, or stranger?  Tell us your story. Dx 7/26/2006, IDC, 3cm, Stage IV, Grade 3, 0/1 nodes, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2- Log in to post a reply",
