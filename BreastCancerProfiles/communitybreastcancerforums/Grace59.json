However, I don't understand my reports.  One says interpectal nodes 7 cm from nipple, another says infraclavicular which looks a lot further than 7 cm to me.  Is this level 2 or level 3 nodes?  Has anyone learned anything more about the physiology than me?  Doing lots of research here and furthering my understanding of basic anatomy and wish I had no reason to be doing so.  Any help given would be appreciated.",
