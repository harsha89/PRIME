Even now, it's sketchy as to when to wear the jobst sleeve? I also feel like I need some chest/breast compression but again, do i self order and its trial and error? I wish I could spend a day with you and ask you all the overwhelming questions that plague me from the time I wake up. I think I caused the hand swelling as I mistakenly slept with the sleeve and must have pushed fluid into my hand. Ok, I know I'm rambling but thanks for telling me about the glove and hopefully as much as I like my PT and she's been great re MLD, I will be able to get some help with the \"how to's\" in management.",

I got some initial relief with early fills but now that I am overfilled and waiting exchange, the discomfort is back. I've got stage 1 LE of left arm and now some breast swelling too. My PT has helped with cording and breaking up painful scar tissue at the SNB site. My hand swelled today for the first time and I will need to add gauntlet to my sleeve. My question is do you think it is unreasonable to hope for some improvement once the TEs are removed? Has anyone else gotten better management of their LE once the TEs are removed? I know this is life long management, but is it wishful thinking to hope that removing these god awful plastic shells will give me some relief? My exchange is 10/27. Thanks in advance.

Kira, hope your mom is doing ok, and that you are too. 3jays, way to go. Just keep on trying what you can manage. That's really all we can do, right? So, I do in fact have confirmed shingles and got my valtrex rx. At least it explains the increased pain and truncal swelling. Of course, the shingles are on LE side so it's like my immune system is trying to fight but just can't drain. I'm trying not to freak out about it and I'm going to just surrender and resume LE management/exercise when I can. So, my \"kick butt\" strategy is only sleep, compression, node clearing, and hydration. Just doesn't seem like my body can handle the stress exercise might put on it. Go windshields team!

I'm still searching for comfort and compression. My exercise yesterday was 30 minutes of Just Dance on the Wii with my daughter! Nothing more embarrassing and humbling than having an 8 year old critique your moves all the while wrapped in ultra fashionable compression! Followed by NORTON DVD, MLD, stretching and chocolate.

What a great report of the meeting! Carol, I just got a few swell spots myself to try. Bi ordered them online at lymphedema products and got free shipping. It was a bit trial and error but the crescent shaped ones (I'm sure I got the idea from Binney) are really perfect for under the arm in that stubborn pit swell area. So far, I'm pleased and they were about $20 each. Feeling like a slug todaybso at the risk of turning into a bug, going to get moving now.",

But, I do have to bite the bullet and resume one of these days. My arm is killing me today - but the NE just got a huge rain/front - we've been in drought conditions so it was well overdue.  But, my arm is really feeling it.  I'm off for my monthly MLD session with LMT so it could not come at a better time.  Tina, Happy birthday to your DH!  My \"self-care\" consisted of too much wine, too little sleep - but loads of laughs and fun!  A ladies night out on Friday and a concert on Saturday complete with dancing!  I also went to the Dr. Massey conference and I am \"a believer\".....I completely drank the kool-aid and I was so engrossed and amazed by the session.  She is warm and funny and compassionate - I have alot to think about and digest but it was so good to hear from a Dr who is at least attempting to address LE.  I have so much to say about it but don't want to hijack this thread.  Carol, you are going to love the Chicago session!!  Ok, off to the city to see LMT and then getting my \"butt\" in gear. ",
