I told her hopefully its just s cyst. Has anyone had this?? I am of know help cause I had a sentenial biopsie at the Hospital before surgery. It must be concerning her surgeon to take a look at it. I am so scared for her. It just keeps getting worse with each visit for her.

If they see to many patients then stop taking so many. I was reduced to tears last Friday from a Neurologist who was hammering me with questions and as you know going through TX we still have that fog and it takes me awhile to comprehend things. And he was so impatient with me so I just flung out any answer. He was better after I cried. But I am sure he had a smile on his face when he was doing the nerve conduction tests and especially the needle conduction I think he poked them in harder then normal!! Although I could not see his face I know he probably was smirking!! HaHA on him I could not feel the needles anyways!!!! I will never go back again!!! I don't care that its Friday and your runnning behind I did not say a thing to him when he came in a hour late for my appointment. So why take it out on me. I feel as cancer patients and I do look like one right now even if I didn't we deserve alittle more compassion. Everyone deserves good treatment. I just think they should take into consideration what we are going through and what we have gone through.               And to top it off I think he is wrong in his diagnoises. He better hope he is not cause I will sue him!!! And I am really not that type of person but he kept on not taking into account what I was saying. I was diagnoised with Neurothy due to chemo even though I have had this for at least 3yrs and have gone to drs. for it. They could not figure out what was wrong and they kept dismissing it. It took the chemo to totally disable me for someone to listen. I think I have a B-12 defiencency and need to be tested for it. I do not have classic signs of neuropthy. I felt everything in my feet it was just up my legs that I didn't, plus my arms tremble at times and also around my mouth. I have blurry vision and also a tinging in my ears. None of those are Neuropthy signs!  I have had no blood test s for any other possiable symptom I can't have a mri due to expander but their is other testing methods. I am being overlooked. So they just stick you on pain meds and expect you to try to go on with your life. Well I am going to my primary and demand some bloodwork and hopefully can get to the bottom of this. Sorry for venting but jeeze louise come on Doctors!!! Believe me I have a few more dr stories. I am learning to start advocating for myself I am usually one who goes along never complains and look at me now!!!!                   I hope to hear from someone with a good Doctor story!!!!!!                                                         Bridget Dx 11/11/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 5/28 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I won't go into boring details but its been a long road. I  have IDC and am triple positive 5/27 nodes positive. The biggest problem is that I am a smoker and as I have cut back but still am as much as I am ashamed to admit. I have smoked over 29yrs and really truly wished I never picked up the first. Reading one of the posts on this discussion board I noticed the post about smoking and radiation. I am now questioning if I should even have it. I am stageIIIa and due to the node involvement they added the rads. I had a bilateral masactomy and would not have neede it if the nodes were fine. Just my luck!!! I really don't want to go through this if all its going to do is give me lung cancer and yes I may get it any ways but why help it. As they tell us when we remove the tumer we treat it as being gone the chemo and rads are safe guards I just don't think its worth it to take the chance I want to try to get on with my life and now to have to think about this do I or don't I just stinks. What do you all think I am only 44 with 2 kids ages 15/12 I am just so confused about this right now! Any feed back would be great!                                                         Bridget Dx 11/11/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 5/28 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I had 5/27 nodes removed. So I know their is a chance that I could get LE. Thats what they are thinking has happened. The techs could not line me up any way they positioned me. But the problem is my regular oncolgist who I just happen to have a appointment with that day disagrees. She says everything measures the same, and I have no swelling in my hands wrist etc. So now I am really confused I have a appointment tommorrow to meet with my Rads Onc. so they can figure this out. I know my arm and part of my breast does feel swollen and tender. So I was wondering what you all make of this since I find the boards seem to have much more knowledge on this. Which is sad to say but you all do.                    Thanks for any imfo you can give me I would greatly appreciate it.                                                             Bridget             Dx 11/11/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 5/28 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

Today after having it worked on it feels really swollen again but its also in the breast area today and under my arm. I am still going through Rads. And I am afraid of whats going to happen today if they will be able to do it. She is very careful where she does light massage due to sweeling but I don't know. She is having me go next week to start wearing a compression sleeve for awhile. But I only have 8 more Rads to go and really want to finish. I just thought this was a good thing but I am beginning to wonder if I should wait to Rads are done. But they sent me there in the first place due to the swelling so I am confused!!!

Had bilateral masactomy and was found to be triple positive stageIII with 5/27 nodes positive.The only scans I have had are liver,muga.I was not in menopause yet so they said the chemo would take care of it if not they would remove my overies if need be. My question is is this normal??? I would think they would remove overies anyways. And how do they not know if I have it in my bones or brain etc without doing any scans. They have not even checked my hormone levels,No I have not had my period but yet I feel like I am still getting some of that pms stuff. And I do know chemo does cause major bone aches and I did get some neropthy from abraxane, but I have not felt well on my legs or back for alot longer then that. Should I be demending or should I trust there judgement. I did ask about when everything was done chemo, radiation if I would be getting a full scan and they said no. What do you all think? Am I just getting perinoid or should I be advocating for myself more?? Any imfo would be great. I also learned of a new test they do where they take a piece of your bone marrow and test it and they are finding out that 50% of the patients who showed no lympnode involvement actually had cancer cells in there marrow. Anyone had that test done or heard of it? Thanks for answering any or all my questions, I am not a real pushy person so I feel kind of torn whether to push or not.                                                                 Bridget  Dx 11/11/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 5/28 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",

I wil be in that clinic on Friday after my appointment in Boston for reconstruction. And I am really going to tell them how I feel and how upset with this whole situation. If they are having trouble getting it approved tell me that. I doubt it cause I am high Risk and am complaining of lower back and hip pain.

I only have 2 more to go! It has seem to be forever. I am suppose to keep moving that arm but I am so burned under my arm pit that I can't even stand to put a shirt on, even the cream they gave me is not helping. Oh well I will get through this too.         My question is after I just went on and on is my Lymph LE told me I should never have surgery on that arm. I am in a huge pickle cause before I was diagnoised with BC I was due to have 3 surgeries done on that arm. Tendon release, ulnarnerve release, carpal tunnel. The problem with not doing this is its in my dominant arm and everytime I use it whether its just to clean my house or whatever it hurts and swells.And if I can't have surgery what am I going to be able to do? I have already had 3 cortisone shots, acupuncture to that arm. Before I had my BC to try to hang on till my work slowed down enough for me to schedule surgery. Now I am like what am I going to do if I can't have it! It is very painful and kept me up at night and its only getting worse. Has anyone had surgery done with the infected LE arm, I know my chances are higher if I do but with 5 lymph nodes out of 28 taken out chances are this is only going to be a problem anyways and I am trying to keep it on the mild side as it is. I would appreciate any info on this. Right now my LE is mostly in my tendonand up area of my arm and my chest foob area. Fingers and wrist look good.                                                              Thanks-Bridget   Dx 11/11/2007, IDC, 5cm, Stage IIIA, Grade 3, 5/28 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
