    "Content": "SewinthePast wrote: Granted I am not totally sure where they took the samples from since but I can feel a \"hollow\" spot in the front upper quaderent (middle not outer) I know they took samples from two places and the one I could see the last images still up (with the needle in place) while they where holding pressure on my breast. I am just kind of wondering if that is one of the sites I am feeling. It feels very different then what it use to feel like (and come to think of it (of course after I would think it odd) it did have a slightly raised appearance on my skin if I lifted my arms over my head but I had lost weight so I figured it was due to that) I knew one was medial lower (but this is medial upper) and the other was to be upper outer. Has anyone else been able to feel the area(s) that were taken? I know they took 12 (8 gauge) samples. trying to keep my mind busy while waiting over the weekend now since I did not hear back today.
