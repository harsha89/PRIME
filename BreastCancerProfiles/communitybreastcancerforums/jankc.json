Congratulations to all of those who completed their radiation and encouragement to all of those still getting zapped! Update: Finished #24 today and because of a new rash under my breast as well as on the top side, I'm now using vinegar soaks and Aquaphor, too.  Nine more sessions to go...",

I have that freckly Irish skin and already had an infection from wearing my heavy post-lumpectomy sports bra before I even started the radiation, so as far as other skin issues, I'm expecting the worst but hoping for the best.  5 out of 33 treatments completed as of today and only 28 more to go, which sounds better to me than 5 1/2 weeks ...: ) ",
