The fact that you have a first degree relative with bc also raises your risk. Usually it is recommended that you go on a 6 month surveillance program where you alternate MRIs and mammograms. Tamoxifen may also be suggested for your case. The nice thing...if there is such a thing.....about having Alh is that you have time to research your options and make an educated decision, but don't \"Dr. Google\" too much, it'll drive you crazy! Good luck to you !",

I cannot imagine any insurance company denying you especially with BRCA+ status. I did not have this test done, as my insurance company does not cover it unless you actually have a cancer diagnosis. In the last two years I have had numerous biopsies all with a pathology of atypical lobular hyperplasia. My breasts were also extremely dense and drs never were 100% sure they were getting the complete picture with mammograms. My MRI results always mentioned the density of my breasts as well. I thought on it for two long years, did some soul searching and decided I needed to take the next step for my peace of mind. I am currently going through the tissue expansion phase of reconstruction and will be getting silicone implants sometime in April. So far it has all been doable. It is a big decision and you do have the luxury of time to be sure of what you want to do. I know for me it was the right choice. Good luck on your upcoming diagnostics and feel free to PM me if you have any questions.",

Granted, I had more than just the ALH, I had a significant family history of pre-menopausal breast cancer. But it is possible to have high risk surveillance if you have a BS that will go to bat for you. Mine did and I was never denied any treatments he deemed necessary. Sometimes it is cheaper for the insurance companies to cover the cost of PBMX than to pay out for repeated biopsies and costly diagnostics. It is an extremely personal decision and as SpecialK said not without risks. If you are leaning towards the PBMX, check out the thread titled PBMX for ADH/ ALH. (Or something like that)",

As you probably know, ADH does increase your risk some say as much as 4 to 5x that of a normal woman. It sounds like you may have other risk factors as well. Is there any way you can get a second opinion? Maybe even from the breast surgeon that referred you. Sometimes people with ADH are offered tamoxifen for prevention (I was diagnosed with ALH but could not take it due to a history of blood clots) Were you put on any high risk surveillance?

At about the 2 month mark the burning started to subside and it is totally gone now. I did use the soft washcloth approach along with some moderate pressure and massage to the areas. It would hurt at first, but somehow the areas seemed to become desensitized after awhile. I did not find that the narcotics helped in any way since it was a nerve pain. As far as some soothing clothing that I found bearable, I bought a few of jjill's pure jill tees. They are a little pricey for a tee, but they are extremely soft and feel almost like butter against your skin. They also last forever and won't pill up. If your pain is interfering with your quality of life, I would recommend taking the neurontin. You can try it for a short period and then once the nerves settle down, you can wean off of it. I did not have to take it for BMX pain, but I have MS and have found it useful during my exacerbations. Hang in there and remember that this is more than likely temporary and that there are things that can be done to help alleviate the pain.",

Depending on your comfort level with high risk monitoring, you can just have close surveillance for a while and give your pocketbook a chance to recover, not to mention letting your body recover. If you still feel strongly about having your remaining breast removed, you can do it at that time. There is no real rush at the moment for further treatment. Best of luck to you!",

Thankfully I was very level and where I wanted to be height-wise with the TE's. I did not have drains but he had told me on the front end that I wouldn't. Tangles, As far as size goes, I'll tell you my experience. I am 5'6\" around 125 now. Chest measurement just under TE's is 29.5 to 30\" My TE's were filled to 450 and I was exchanged out to 450cc hp. I do not have the projection that my TE's had, but I am very slightly wider. I went to the mastectomy shop yesterday to get fitted for my bras and she put me in a 32D. In clothes I look like a good C, but in no way do I look like a D. Because the implants are much wider than a natural breast, you will more than likely be a cup larger than you think you will be, but you WILL NOT LOOK LIKE IT when you are clothed. You will not look as large as your 500cc TE's if you stay with 500cc implants. They will conform to your ribs which feels much better, but does a number on the projection. I would most definitely go larger if you like the look of your TE's, you need a larger number of cc's in the silicone implants to approximate that look. Once you make the decision of what size to go with, it gets a little easier, but I do have to confess that I was second guessing myself going right into surgery. In the end, I'm really happy with the size. Before surgery I had to wear a padded bra that was really too big to look the way I do now. I was a full B before surgery, wore bras that made me look like a full C and most of my friends tell me that I don't even look like I have had surgery.

They serve a two-fold purpose. First, they make it easier to slide your fingers down the tubing. Secondly, since drains and tubing are a port of entry for germs, the swabs also disinfect the drains. I use them to also clean the stopper thing if I have touched it when opening it to drain. Please do not use lotion, as lotion harbors germs. Mirmirpanda, your sentiments about the waiting being worse than the surgery was exactly right! My recovery is continuing to improve daily. It is rainy here, so in order to get my walking in, I have to go from kitchen to back bedroom and back. It's boring, but it serves its purpose! I make these rounds several times a day.

If you do a google search on it, you can find the statistics and treatment suggestions. Most of what I've read says it can go away on its own, but sometimes it requires intervention with someone like a lymphedema therapist or a PT that specializes in breast surgery. Yes, a cut in your armpit can increase your chances for lymphedema, so please be extra careful! Sunny D, glad surgery went well. Sorry to hear about such a horrible post-op experience! Josie123, great news on your margins. Glad that swelling turned out to be mostly gauze! Love, love, love it when the fix is something so simple! : ) Hopex3, I'm afraid it will be awhile before we are able to sleep on our sides again. Because tissue expanders have the nasty little habit of migrating under our armpits, side sleeping becomes an even bigger challenge as the expanders grow : ( Seirouslysammy, hi and welcome. Never too late to post! Glad to hear margins are good and it sounds like you are doing well. I can only imagine how hard it is to adjust to a private insurance based system such as ours here while going through all this.

My PS is doing 100cc's at a time and the night of a fill and the next day are a little tough, but other than that I only really notice them when I take a super deep breath. However, can't wait until I'm able to hug my DH without bruising him! My TE's are at capacity and are really firm. I have noticed that as the week goes on after my fill, it eventually softens up as my pecs surrender. By then it is time for another fill! This week I plan on asking for a half fill as we are headed to the beach the day after my fill. I think maybe I can heal a little better with some sand between my toes for a few days. Tried on my swim suit with these bricks and I have to say...I think I look better with these things than I did with my natural breasts! (Guess I gotta look on the bright side of things.)",

The only advice I have is to take the way you look one day at a time. At first I had a very large pucker in my cleavage area and obsessed about it. Now it is almost completely filled in. I am now in the process of dropping and fluffing and really liking the way it is starting to look. It may be a blessing in disguise that you didn't get the fat grafting with your exchange surgery. As things settle, divots and ripples happen and you would want to fix most of that with the fat grafting anyway. Take it easy, don't do too much even though you will most likely feel like you can. I just keep telling myself that this is a process and that the process takes its own sweet time. I have my one month (plus a little) follow-up in a couple of weeks and we plan on talking about nips, fat grafting and a few small tweaks. Hopefully I can get things taken care of in a couple of months so I can be ready for my Vinnie trip in December! Things look different slowly, but surely! If you don't believe me, start taking pictures of yourself (if you are not already) after the unveiling on a consistent basis, then compare them to each other.

He's been doing 100cc's at a time and this was my 3rd fill. It is the strangest sensation as he does the fill. It doesn't hurt just kind of gives me the creepy crawlies. I'm now up to 350cc's. I had an absolutely horrible night last night and have hurt a good bit off and on today. Definitely will not do that large of a fill again. There's no prize for finishing quickly. I'm pretty much as big as I want to be so I think I will just go with the 100cc overfill (in two separate fills) and call it quits! Sometimes I feel like I traded my tube socks with bean bags in them for bocce balls! Glad to hear about everyone's clear margins and for those of you who are still plotting your paths, I pray things resolve quickly for you so that you can rest easier knowing you have a plan!",

It is amazing how stiff you get after just 3 weeks of being down!). The weather is beautiful here today a balmy 65 degrees and a high in the 70's tomorrow! Is this really January? I'm sitting out on the deck and reading over all the names for surgery in January. My heart is saddened that there are so many, but yet encouraged that there are so many fighting for healthier lives. I have lifted each of you up by name and pray that wherever you are in this journey you get continued strength. MMSS, yay no drains! It is the most freeing experience is it not? Tamiami, so sorry you are having to deal with the fever on top of all of this. Robinlee76, I also had a hard lump right where my drains were, my PS told me that they could be clots so now I am taking aspirin daily until they go away. Dadebbs, I hope your flu bug hurries up and leaves you alone! Lmimp64, when do you start PT? I was in PT before surgery for MS related issues and my therapist told me to come back as soon as I was released to work on the tightness and scar tissue formation. PT seems to help me in most areas when I have needed it. I hope you find relief soon. Hopex3 glad to hear you are doing so well, but do not try to rush off your pain meds too soon, pain can actually keep your body from healing. Please take it if you need to! (I know I am not telling you anything you don't already know, but sometimes we just need to hear it again!) Pattszy, sorry to hear that more treatment may be in your future, but just as you've gotten through this, you can get through whatever they throw at you! Lbwagner69, melindagb, and shadytrake, best of luck to you all tomorrow! Praying for calm nerves and a restful night tonight!",

Appts, tests themselves, biopsies and follow-up appts not to mention the stress of waiting for results. It all became more than I could bear and I chose to have the pbmx. That is absolutely not the right choice for everybody, but I know it was the right choice for me. shadytrake, what a wonderful man that husband of yours is!

Waiting is the worst! Josie123, I am sorry to hear about your father-in-law. I will be thinking of both you and your family as they all begin to process the news. Hopex3, I understand what you are saying about what you look like...all mangled. I have one TE that is up under my armpit and is expanding sideways like a loaf of bread. It is better now, but I wonder if I will ever see myself as normal again. Chelle21, in regards to how much help you need, every person is different, but my experience was that I needed someone around the clock for the first day after I got home. Then for the next 3 or 4 days I just needed someone near the house. After that I was able to do most things alone. It took some planning ahead like putting the milk in a smaller container or having my meal planned if I was going to be alone. The best investment I made was a super lightweight step stool. It kept me from being tempted to raise my arms above my shoulders. I was and am terrified of getting lymphedema! Hope that helps.",

Tami, Sorry to hear that you have yet to be cleared, but that cellulitis is evil and I'm glad your PS is staying on top of it. Don't worry too much about your clients, my stylist was out for 6 months and I was never so happy to see her come back. It's hard to find someone that can cut my wild curly hair! Hope, Glad to hear things are looking up for you. I really would not recommend anyone getting their fills on the same schedule I did. The week after my drains were pulled, I got 100cc's every week. The only reprieve I had was when I went on vacation and waited 2 1/2 weeks for this last one. Each time I kept telling myself that I would ask for it to be cut in half, but by the time my next appointment rolled around I'd forgotten how uncomfortable I had been and I would let him put in another 100cc's.

I think you will find that these boards have so much to offer not only for support, but for information and you know what they say about information....information is power. I feel like I was so much more prepared for surgery and what to expect by reading these boards. That being said...an update on my progress. Surgery was Monday, saw PS today. He removed 2 of my 4 drains and said that he anticipates being able to remove the other 2 at my next follow-up on Tuesday. What was it like? Well,from what I understand, most surgeons do not numb the area before pulling drains, but thankfully mine did. My left side is more numb than my right side and all I felt on that side was a pulling sensation. The right side was a little more uncomfortable than the left, but not extremely painful. A few seconds and it was over. I also talked to him about the sensation of my muscles clamping down on the TEs and he said it was my pecs revolting and it was normal. Sometimes I feel them get so tight that I can feel it all the way to my shoulder blades, again, not painful, but uncomfortable. Most of the time I feel like I have a spanx camisole rolled up under my armpits and stretching across the front of my chest. I'm not saying this to frighten anyone, but I promised to be honest and in the end, I think if you know that these are normal sensations, you will be better equipped to handle them if they happen to you. Overall, I am very pleased with the outcome so far! I pray everyone is continuing to recover well with minimal discomfort.",

For those of you who have had surgeries during my hiatus, you were in my thoughts and prayers. Sympathies to those who are still dealing with drains and happy dances for those of you who were able to shed that burden! Saw PS on Tuesday and he did my first fill. I was terrified of how I would feel that night and the next day since I had read that the more athletic and fit you were, the more you would hurt. I had a really hard time right after surgery with just the initial fill of 50cc's, so I almost fell out when he said he was going to do 100cc's on each side! Apparently my TEs were wrinkled and he didn't like that. Fast forward to later that evening...my back and shoulders were really pulling, but nothing that some muscle relaxers and the heating pad for my back couldn't handle. Today is much better and even though I'm only 150cc's I feel almost like my old self. (My TEs are only 350cc's) Will have you in my prayers tonight and tomorrow, BrandieMcAdams!",

If the Vicodin was not helping the pain, it is more than likely nerve pain and a trial run of neurontin may be what you need. You might be surprised if you reach out to your BS office. I had a similar experience for a different medical problem. When I called to tell them that I did not have the expected results, they were very appreciative for the information and told me that they had never had any problems before, but would reconsider referring patients to the clinic in question. Turns out, there were many patients having issues similar to mine but no one ever told the dr's office so they thought their concerns were being resolved. I have MS and from personal experience I can tell you that PT is only as good as the therapist. Over the years I have had at least 30 physical therapists and only a small number of them are good enough for me to refer people to! Hope you find relief soon.",

One word of advice, with the neurontin, you want to take it exactly the way your dr. prescribed it. I stopped it all of a sudden a few years ago and found out it makes you very sick to stop without weaning off of it. Hope relief comes soon for you!",

They are much softer and seem to be falling more naturally. If they didn't fall into my armpits I would definitely be leaving them alone, but alas, I see a revision in my future : P Remember to take it easy for the full 6 weeks. Hope that blasted drain comes out soon and that you can enjoy the rest of your summer in your soft, squishy boobs!",

He told me it was stronger and would help with the rippling from thin skin. To which I asked, why didn't we use it the first time? He kinda danced around that one. I'll be thinking of you on the tenth. Here's hoping for good results!",

Glad you are kicking herceptin instead of it kicking you. How much longer for those treatments? Are you finished with your reconstruction? I just had a revision 3 weeks ago and am very pleased so far with the results. I had pockets completely rebuilt and fat grafting. Will probably have to have a couple more rounds of the fat grafting, but all in all hopefully it will all be over soon. So glad your kids have their teacher back and that their teacher has her kids back. They can be energizing and draining at the same time, but so rewarding. It was great to hear from ya. Would love to hear from some of our other January surgery sisters.",
