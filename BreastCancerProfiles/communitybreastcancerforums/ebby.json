Trying to prep myself to help take care of her, she has 2/4 lymph nodes tested as having cancer cells in them so they are taking more again tomorrow, we'll know in a week or so what lays ahead and what the tumors stats are, it is currently 2cm + anyone able to give personal exp/opinion on which surgery they've had and why they chose it?",
