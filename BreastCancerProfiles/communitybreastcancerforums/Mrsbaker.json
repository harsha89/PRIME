So please remember that there are benign causes to calcifications! As for the biopsy, the freezing needle was uncomfortable. I didn't feel any \"pain\" afterwards. Just a mild pinching/burning sensation for each of the six samples. I would feel that burn, hear a beep, then hear it rotate for the next sample. So it was basically burn/beep/noise, burn/beep/noise....six times. And by burn, by no means do I mean like a painful burn, more just a subtle cutting/burning sensation. For a millisecond. The actual biopsy itself (not the mammos/adjustments/freezing/marker/more mammos, etc), just the biopsy itself took less than a minute. You'll be fine, I promise. They really do freeze you up pretty good.  I'm also a teacher. Try to enjoy your summer plans. I consciously kept busy and stuck to the plans I had for the summer (even when I didn't feel like it). I mean what's the alternative? Sit and worry? Keep busy. Know that there are benign causes to calcifications (mine were actually pleomorphic micro-calcifications\u2026a more \"worrisome\" type, and mine were benign).  Let us know how it goes.  ",
