She will be getting Abraxane once a week for 3 weeks and then one week off. H and P once every 3 weeks. She finished her first dose last Tuesday. Since it is skin mets, we can see visually how chemo is acting. How many doses does she need to get to see a visual difference. I know it sounds stupid to ask like this but last time around when she was on TCHP combo her skin mets almost disappeared in 2 doses. After the first one we saw the skin mets recede drastically in 10 days. Thanks for any input. Log in to post a reply",
