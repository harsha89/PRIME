It was my second time. My first bout was nine years ago and I had chemo and radiation. I had NO residual effects. This time, my skin was really burnt to a crisp and I experience quite a bit of pain. It is not an everyday thing, but today I feel it a lot. It does feel like a burning and I just know that that area of my body is there. Ibuprophen does help it, but I do not like to take it all of the time. I was told that it is the nerve endings regenerating, but I thought that would be over by now. Now, as I read the posts, it seems that it could last for a very long time. I guess that misery loves company. Does anyone else feel this burning, uncomfortable, sore sensation? It is not terrible, but I am concerned because I did not feel any of it the first time. I was wondering if it has to do with my age, the spot of radiation, or I don't know what. There is slight discoloration, but no other obvious side effects. I use ice sometimes and that helps but doesn't cure. Anyone in the same situation or know some good techniques to deal with it? This is a silly question, but do you tell anyone how you are feeling or do you keep it to yourself? Everyone thinks that I am doing just fine, but these bouts of pain are not so pleasant. I don't complain because everyone has baggage. I feel like I want my family and friends to know. It seems selfish, but maybe some sympathy would help. Strange, but I was wondering what any of you feel. Thanks for letting me rant and I appreciate any feedback. Sincerely, Karen Ehlin",
