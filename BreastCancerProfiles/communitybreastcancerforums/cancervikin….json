I told them the day before my lumpectomy and gave them the assignment to say a prayer for me for my surgery and for the surgeon performing the surgery. They asked some questions nothing I couldn't answers. One student stated \"This means you are going to go bald\" I explained that sometimes the medicine used to get rid of the cancer cells also kill other cells such as the one that make your hair grow. That this is only temporary and that my hair will grow back in again. Besides they will be able to see me is so many neat hats. I believe sharing just the basic information is important and to answer questions as they arise. There are many good books out there for children about cancer you can use as resources best of luck...Pam",

I shared in earlier notes that I turned 42 in February. I have been married for 10 years to my wonderful husband my rock and support. We have been blessed with 2 daughters Gretchen age 9 and Megan age 7 We have been very honest with our children and they are part of my team in fighting this battle. FYI there are some good books for children about breast cancer our favorites are The Year My Mother Was Bald by Ann Speltz for my older daughter and Our Mom Has Cancer by Abigail and Adrienne Ackermann for both daughters. My daughters took the second book to school and shared the story with their class. As for me, I am a registered nurse and have worked for 18 years in postpartum, nursery and neonatal intensive care units. For the last 2 years I have been working my dream job doing Newborn home visits for new moms and babies in conjunction with a state early childhood developmental program called Help Me Grow. I am very blessed to have a very understanding boss and I schedule visits for my good days. Unfortunately this week the flu threw me for a loop! Di53 Try some Gold Bond Extra Strength body Lotion for Extra Dry and Itchy Skin. My daughters job at night is to massage my head with lotion, They love it and think it will make my hair grow in faster Ha Ha. Anyway it feels good :-> I have a wig also. I call it my $200.00 dollar deductible . ( I am blessed with excellent insurance which covers 100% besides co-pays after meeting my personal $200.00 deductible. I had to fight with the insurance company to pay for the wig but at least I can tell people I know where my deductible is at all times Ha Ha. I save the wig for church and work but prefer to wear hats at home and out in public. I'm feeling great today and decided to go to work for a while. Well guess what after being in the office for only one hour the the snow accumulated at least 3 inches and It keeps on coming the weather forecast is predicting the snow estimates in feet. Got to love Ohio weather our slogan is \"If you don't like the weather, Wait 10 min\" Ha! Ha! Hope all are well and are enjoying better weather Crazypam",

The nurse in the office said this should go easier. This round was easier I convinced my oncologist to assume the inevitable that I would be dehydrated and came in for hydration Mon, Wed and Friday (today) wow this made a huge difference. I wore a crazy hat for chemo once again. A hard plastic viking hat with two large horns and two blonde braides hanging from the side. The Doc looked at me and burst out laughing and said she doesn't even know what to say about this hat. Made all the nurses and other chemo patients laugh. My goal is to choose laughter rather than crying whenever I can. Found the next chemo hat the local Goodwill yesterday and this even tops the Viking hat. It is a huge Mexican sombrero blue velvet with sequins and hand stitching It weighs as much as my 7 year old daughter. Ha Ha!! I'm looking forward to going to the looking good feeling better on Tuesday. this will be the 3rd attempt to attend. the first 2 were canceled due to snow. I'm praying for no snow on Tuesday, but living in Ohio you can expect anything when it comes to weather. I'll be praying for all and hope everyone has a wonderful weekend!!! Pam",

I had very long thick lashes and thick brows but I know they will grow back. Evie... be careful with dental cleanings during chemo or if you have a port in. I would check with your oncologist to see if you need to take some antibiotics to prevent any infections. My oncologist suggested I wait until after chemo and so did the dentist. 2 days out from Taxol and I'm feeling achy and having some joint and general pain. Also experiencing a lot of bladder pressure. Donna I hope your enjoy your trip to florida. Our family has planned our dream trip to disney world for the end of September to the beginning of October.

Finally on Friday (the next day) I had an appt with the radiation oncologist who I didn't say anything about the lump and let him find it.  I told him regardless of what the doctors were saying I was still concerned and he ordered a mammogram and ultrasound because he was concerned also.  Thank you God!! It turned out to be a small hematoma in my breast and not cancer!!  As I say, We have to be our own advocate.  I refused to leave the office until the order was in my hand.  Always make someone listen to your concerns!!! Well on to radiation starting  7/31 the last phase of this long journey. hugs and prayers, Pam ",

She said this is strange but not overly concerned. Who knows maybe part of the lovely spring allergies in Ohio. I wore a huge mexican somboro to chemo and asked for a margarita. made everyone laugh.

I am still slowly losing my eyelashes and brows. Everyone is keeps commenting on how I still have my eyebrows but they use to be thick like Brooke Sheilds now they are thin and sparce maybe I can hold on to a few for a while. Has anyone noticed their hair starting to come back? If I look closely my head looks like a peach with some white fuzz starting to come in. My hair was brown before coming out I hope it does not all come in white. I may have to take a brown sharpie marker to the stubble to make it brown again Ha Ha! Friday will be Taxol #2. Not looking forward to it but at least it is one more closer to done!! Wishing all are well you are in my thoughts and prayers Pam",

Grannie/Rose Wishing your many blessing and prayers for you as you begin your Radiation journey I was told by a coworker that after the first appt. when they do measurements and markings your actual time for radiation is about 2 min. She said that changing from her clothes to her gown was the worst part. Make sure if you have any skin sensitivity or pain you let them know right away they have creams and lotions to help. You may want to buy some camisole or tank tops to wear if skin is sensitive to wear your bra. Also she advised me to stock up on some aloe gel to help. I am a little jealous I must admit. You may be finished by the end of June. My last chemo will be on July 11 before I begin the radiation route. prayers for all Pam",

Yeah!  Has anyone noticed the weekly side effects get worse and seem to be accumulative?  I'm so ready to be done and start the next venture the rads.  I have the appt with the radiation oncologist on Friday 7/11.  Plan to go to the chemo appt as Helga with the viking helmet and may lip sync some opera music because as they say \"It aint over until the fat lady sings\".  I can't say I'm not scared with  my triple neg breast cancer.  How are they going to reassure me that the Ca is not mets. in lungs, liver and brain?  I have not had any pet scans and am nervous.  I guess this is just part of my new life after breast cancer.  Hope rads are going easily for all you on that adventure and you all remain in my thoughts and prayers Pam S ",
