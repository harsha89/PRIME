I have had the surgeon, the radiation doc and the oncologist look at it at my regular appointments. The surgeon says its scar tiissue and the two oncs say its fluid but nobody seems to address how long the pain may last. I have appointments with the onc in Feb and with the surgeon in March for routine followup.My surgeries were in May (lumpectomy, sentinel node biopsy, and node dissection.)",

My question is pain. I have a very painful knot near where the lymph node dissection was. Do others have this and does it get better?",

I did have a pet scan before the chemo began and it did not indicate any cancer had spread beyond the breast lump and one lymph node. All this uncertainty is surely hard to take, isn't it. She did say that if I am worried about any symptom to come in to see her and that worrying is normal....fat lot of good that is. Thanks for the info on what you're experiencing, jaelsne. It helps to \"talk\" to someone going thru the same thing. I have been taking Naproxen (Rx strength Aleve) and that seems to help some. I also have tried Darvocet but the Naproxen seems to be better. The lymphodema expercises seem to help some too. so maybe the fluid theory is right.Â  Arnie2 ... I understand that Arimidex is going generic sometime this spring so at least we'll save some $. lol",

If it is any comfort you can be glad that they found it now and NOT after you have gone thru the lumpectomy, chemo and rads. Even if this is additional cancer, they can treat it and you stand excellent chances, My thoughts will be with you. The waiting is the pitts.",
