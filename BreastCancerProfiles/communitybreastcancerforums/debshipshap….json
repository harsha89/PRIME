I just was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in my right breast. I had a core needle biopsy which seems to indicate Stage 1 ER+Pr+Her2-. I spoke with Stanford Radiology (where I was treated in 1981) and my Breast Surgeon who both seem to believe that it may be possible to have a lumpectomy and radiation after 30 years. I am scheduled to talk with the radiation oncology department before the lumpectomy to see if this is possible. I have been debating about a double mastectomy because of the risks. After my visit with my Surgeon I thought well maybe we could try the less is more approach and see what that looks like. At the very least it would give me a clearer diagnosis because more tissue would be removed in the lumpectomy. Then I could still opt for a mastectomy.   Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance,  Deb",

I was able to do a lumpectomy followed by brachytherapy even though I had mantle radiation 31 years ago.  They are now doing more cases of repeat radiation on HD Survivors. You can call Stanford Radiation Oncology and ask for Dr. Hancock to call you back. He is very helpful.   It was and remains a hard decision not to have a Mastectomy. I am still unsure knowing that the next time it comes up (hope not) I will have to make that choice. For me, it was a way to buy time. My cancer was small (4 mm), yours is DCIS, not technically cancer from what I understand.  I am almost 3 months from surgery, 2 months from treatment. I will meet with my oncologist next month and look again at the options. It is all what kind of risk you are comfortable living with. It sucks but there is support and you do not need to rush. Take your time and feel comfortable with your choices. Good luck xoxxo Deb",

I was treated at Stanford in 1981. They did a heart study about 15 years ago which I participated in. I was diagnosed with Atrial Fibrillation 3 years ago which they think it unrelated but who knows. I also have been on thyroid meds for the last 28 years. If it's not one thing it's another!! But we're here!! Deb",

I had Stage IIIA Hodgkins in 1981 with total nodular radiation. My Breast Cancer was Grade 1 diagnosed earlier this year. My tumor was 4 mm with considerable DCIS and no lymph node involvement.  I believe you can choose radiation again but you have to be able to live with the risks of recurrence. I felt like I had one pass on choosing mastectomy. They are overly anxious to take our breasts, in my opinion. However, if it had been a bigger tumor or on my left side I would have chosen mastectomy. I would not risk heart problems by re-radiating.  So far things have been great. No issues with the radiation. I may still choose a mastectomy or bi-lateral mastectomy down the line but for now I am OK with my choice.  Best of luck, trust your instincts they saved your life before!  xoxxo Deb",

I am trying to look at the lumpectomy as a starting point to gather more information. I need more of a definitive diagnosis than the one I have from the core needle biopsy. I have been around this block before where they say it looks small, it looks early, only to be told later something else.  What's interesting is talking to other BC women (w/o a Hodgkins history) who hate the idea of radiation. Radiation therapy gave me 30 years of survival so I have a different take. I do feel that we are a special group who need each other for information. The Doctors are somewhat stumped by us.  Thanks again for the hug across the ocean!! xoxxo Deb",

I had a lumpectomy last Thursday with a possibility to do brachytherapy starting next Monday. I am anxiously awaiting the pathology report on Wednesday. The decision to go forward  with bracy will be dependent on the size and type of cells present. I am scared about not doing the mastectomy but I wanted to see what would be possible before making that decision.  I will keep you posted on my week ahead.   Thanks,  Deb",

I seem to be in the minority because I chose to have a lumpectomy and brachytherapy. It is hard to sit with the fear or recurrence but I feel like this was the right decision for me based on the pathology of the tumor. Of course, I will remain hyper-vigilant as we all do. I am 31 years from my Hodgkins diagnosis, hyper-vigilance is a way of life.  I am two month from my surgery and 7 weeks from the end of treatment. I feel good, my energy returned, my body still a bit beaten up.   I think it is important to say there are other choices besides mastectomy these days. It is all about your personal risk tolerance. I believe the medical profession does too much to push the mastectomies but time will tell if I am misguided on that.  Love to all of you,  Deb",
