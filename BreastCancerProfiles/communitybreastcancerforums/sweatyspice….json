I had a big surgery and wanted to wait a bit longer to heal, so I was going to start 9 weeks out. My rad onc was fine with that, but there was a glitch at my first session and they had to delay another week and a half to re-do the calculations.  I'm a bit worried about having waited this long, as I was ready to start last Monday, but .... there's nothing I can do about it now but hope for the best.  Now I'll (hopefully!) start tomorrow.  My surgery was at the very end of January. Best of luck to you.",

They also had a binder with tons of Michael Buble CDs, and I remember some Celine Dion in there too, but I'd already been complaining via text message about the music in the waiting room being designed for people 20 - 30 years older than myself (mostly big band era hits) and I am NOT a fan of Buble or Dion....so that would be reeeeally bad (apologies to those who like them). There was a Sarah MacLachlan in there that I own and really like and was afraid to choose... Do I go for Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby or stay the hell away from my favorite records?  Hmmmm.....

What I'm confused about is why they'd do node surgery before you made a decision about mastectomy v lumpectomy.  Seems to me a node surgery could/should be done at the same time as the \"real\" lumpectomy or mast.",

So to answer your question, you have to do an MRI biopsy if the only way you can \"see\" the suspicious area is on MRI.  (For me, the MRI showed two areas but the mammo showed only one of them.) Please keep in mind that MRI is very sensitive, and can show false positives.  One of the ways to keep the false positive rate down is to have the MRI done during the beginning of your period - I've forgotten exactly which days it's supposed to be between, so ask your Dr.!!!! So, if you want to have an MRI, take your period into account when you think about the schedule. Calcifications are tiny bits of calcium that can form for various reasons, one of those reasons being cancerous cells.  The calcium deposits can often be seen on mammo. MRI measures....blood uptake, I think.  Cancerous cells absorb more, probably because they're growing faster than normal cells (I'm guessing).  MRI won't see calcium deposits, but it will highlight cells that are unusually active. Sometimes surgeons do these biopsies, sometimes radiologists do.  Both of my biopsies were done by radiologists. I would also think about doing the BRCA genetic test, that takes 2-3 weeks for results to come back and you usually have to see a genetic counselor for it.  A breast surgeon should be able to recommend a genetics specialist. Sorry you have to go through this at all, hoping it's all benign for you!",

If you search, somewhere online there are instructional videos, I think by the equipment manufacturer, on how to perform an MRI biopsy.  They describe the whole thing, if you're interested. As I remember it, the process was longer then the original MRI scan, they slide you in, they slide you out, they slide you in, they slide you out, etc.  I've blocked out the details of how many times and why - that sort of info would be on the videos I mentioned. Tylenol is OK (picky about the pain relievers b/c some of them cause blood thinning and that will worsen healing, but Tylenol doesn't do that so it's approved for post-biopsy), Valium (or similar) beforehand is OK.   Ice and sports/compression bra.

If DCIS comes back, half the time it will come back as an invasive cancer.  So the worry factor after active treatment ends is probably similar to what ladies with invasive disease experience.   Once again, all my best to the invasive girls!",

So:  Very rarely, if ever, will DCIS involve chemo.  If you have a mastectomy for DCIS, very rarely if ever will you also have radiation. If you have a lumpectomy for DCIS, you will probably have radiation (but if your grade is low enough and your DCIS is small enough you might be really lucky and escape rads).  Also, if you have a lumpectomy for DCIS, many surgeons consider SNB optional.  If the pathology came back with an unfortunate invasive surprise, you'd go back for the SNB in a second surgery.  (SNB is standard with mastectomy though, b/c you can't go back in.) Tamoxifen and ... I think that other one for post-menopausal women (I'm forgetting the name) are the only hormonals approved. I can see how DCIS might not even seem like cancer to a woman with invasive disease.  But telling us you think so gets us pretty riled up.  This was not a surgery I ever wanted to have.

I had multicentric disease, so the standard of care for me was a mastectomy but I couldn't go through with it.  Due to the location of the areas of my DCIS and the fact that I was large breasted, I was able to have the surgery I did. Double lumpectomy was another option but all the surgeons were concerned that they wouldn't get clean margins, and that even if they did the cosmetic result would be bad.  I ended up with 4mm and 7mm margins from the DCIS, but my path report showed residual LCIS and ADH (or is it ALH? I'm too lazy to look right now) and ADH (or ALH) in the breast we thought was healthy.  I feel like a recurrence waiting to happen but I'm not ready to part with my breasts unless/until I really do get a recurrence.  So, after thinking about it, I'm not going to fight the rads & Tamox. As far as the dread is concerned, I was always terrified of BC so my stress level hasn't really changed much. (When I was a little girl I lived with my Mom who had divorced and moved back in with her parents.  I saw my grandmother have a mastectomy & then die of bone mets in the late 1960's.  A very long time ago and I know treatment has changed significantly, but I was VERY young and impressionable.)   I'm BRCA negative.    What I'm most afraid of is the physical mutilation, and I'm not going to do that to myself unless/until I have no other choice.",

I'd mention that all along the way, the surgeons I saw told me I had time to make a decision from a medical standpoint and that they were only concerned about the stress level and my mental health - with one very notable exception.  One breast surgeon who I saw at the end got VERY angry with me for dragging it out so long, he was concerned about the cancer turning invasive while I procrastinated. So, I delayed for several months - and it was longer than I would have liked it to be, but that's how long it took for me to meet a BS and PS team I felt good about, a procedure I felt OK about (I ended up not having a mastectomy in the end - I had a double lumpectomy combined with a reduction and lift, plus a reduction and lift in the healthy breast), and schedule everything.  My final pathology was still DCIS.   Because everything ended up going well, I don't regret the waiting. BUT - if there was really a concern about invasion, or if more of the surgeons felt that I needed to have surgery NOW and stop dilly dallying, well....that's a whole other story, and one that's outside my experience.  In that case, I probably would NOT have waited so long. Wishing you the best of luck, and congrats on your upcoming wedding!",

I know that's wholly emotional, not rational in the least, and that mastectomy has changed drastically in the last 40 years.  It's just NOT the same procedure in 2010 that it was in 1965.  But the deep emotional imprint was there, and I was utterly freaked out. I'm also middle aged and single, and really, I'd like to have sex again before I die.  I don't have a DH standing my my side telling me how much he loves me and only cares that I live through it.  So there's the dating issue.  Plus, my breasts have always been VERY important to me sexually. I was very, very reluctant to let that go. I was also diagnosed with a stage 0 cancer.  That was another emotional component.  Something about it being caught so early made me go to \"I'm going to mutilate my body by amputating my breasts for THIS measly pissant level of disease?\" From the beginning, I always saw it as amputation and mutilation. Based on my presentation and pathology, it was standard of care.  It was explained to me, by a lot more than one BS, that if I did not have a mastectomy I would be looking at a much higher recurrence rate than average. But every time I thought about having the mastectomy I wanted to throw up. I Just Couldn't Do It. I ended up not doing it.  Now I have much smaller breasts, am in the middle of radiation treatment, and will take Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I think of this as \"bonus time\" with my breasts.  I can always have a mastectomy later if there IS a recurrence, something I half-expect.  Should that come to pass, especially if the recurrence is invasive, yes, there's a good chance I'll regret not having done mastectomy the first time and getting it over with.  But at the time, I just couldn't. I had a consult with a rad onc while I was trying to decide what to do, and told her if the course of disease was short, say two weeks, I'd rather be dead in two weeks and call it a life than have a numb \"thing\" on my chest for the rest of a long life.  She said \"that's very interesting.\"  HA!  So, I fall into the \"largely ornamental and serve no function\" category.  Maybe I'm \"vain.\"  But you asked for reasons and those are mine. If, when you think of mastectomy - even knowing about the loss of sensation, the potential complications, etc etc etc - if it gives you a sense of relief, it might be right for you.  As I said, every time I thought about it all I wanted to do was puke.",

I'd also mention that when I was thinking mastectomy, I was also thinking immediate DIEP reconstruction - which made scheduling more difficult.  Even in November, with that as a plan I was looking at a January surgery. I just re-read your original post  - with a lat flap, yes, you're probably looking at a scheduling delay. So, you're having the MRI biopsy April 2?  You probably won't have results for another week.  And it seems like you already know you have 2 areas of DCIS and have accepted that you're looking at a mastectomy and reconstruction.....so the MRI biopsy shouldn't change your surgical planning.  I'm not even sure why they want to delay to DO the MRI, precisely because it won't change the surgical plan....unless it's because they're afraid it's invasive....but if it's not going to change the surgery, who cares?  They'd have that info from the surgical pathology report.  Frankly, I don't understand why they're putting you through this biopsy. In any case, if you do have the MRI, by the time you get the biopsy results it will be mid April and I don't see any reason not to wait 2 weeks, get married and enjoy yourself.  I can't imagine a few weeks making much of a difference, but again, I'd ask my Dr. My personal opinion is to book the June 15th date NOW, or whatever the first surgery date you can get is.  You can always change it for a later date, and maybe you'll be able to get an earlier date if there's a cancellation.  If you delay in booking anything, the earliest available date will soon be July.  I lived that one. I don't know why they suspect the third area is invasive, my hunch is that it's just more DCIS, but I'm not a Dr.  If it's just because it wasn't visible on ultrasound, well, none of my DCIS was visible on ultrasound - so I'm not taking 'invisible on ultrasound' alone as convincing evidence that it's invasive.  Maybe there's more to it than that.... I'm starting radiation in a few weeks, and as much as I'd rather not have anything to do with radiation, I'm less afraid of it than I was the surgery.  So yes, I hope the worst is behind me!  I guess I'll find out soon enough.

I also have DCIS.  Some surgeons have suggested nipple-sparing and I've discussed the option.  one said something like \"all the ducts lead to the nipple.  After a mastectomy, you won't be having mammograms in that breast anymore and if you have a recurrence, the only way you'll know is when it's palpable, when you can feel it.  By that time, it won't be caught early, it will be invasive cancer, and it's not worth the risk to keep a nipple.\" Now, I don't know if what this surgeon said was true, or how many other breast surgeons would agree with her, but there's definitely a difference between a DCIS recurrence and an invasive recurrence.... Of course there will always be a post-mastectomy risk of recurrence in the scar tissue or any remaining breast tissue, but that risk can't be eliminated. So...I'd have a serious talk about recurrence risk with a surgeon, or two, or three - see what most of them say.",
