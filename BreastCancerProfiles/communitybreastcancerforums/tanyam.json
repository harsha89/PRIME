ITS A VERY RARE CANCER OF THE APPENDIX AND THE ONLY TREATMENT AVAILABLE WAS A BIG SURGERY TO REMOVE ORGANS AND HIPEC. SHE JUST RECENTLY PASSED AWAY IN APRIL. SHORTLY AFTER I FOUND A LUMP AND HERE I AM WITH BREAST CANCER AT AGE 40. LAST YEAR MY BROTHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ORAL CANCER. SO THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE BEEN SUPER HARD AND I AM A SINGLE PARENT. THE TIME WHEN I WOULD NEED MY MOM WOULD BE NOW AND I DONT HAVE HER AND STILL DEALING WITH THE GRIEF OF LOSING HER OVER 3 MONTHS AGO. I AM SO THANKFUL TO COME ACROSS THIS WEBSITE, IT HAS HELPED WITH A LOT OF THINGS I DIDNT KNOW, OR THINGS I NEEDED TO ASK. I AM ARMED WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR MY DR TOMORROW AND HOPING SHE CAN OFFER ANOTHER CHEMO REGIMEN. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR INPUT.",
