    "Content": "concerned81 wrote: When I was 23, I had extremely swollen lymphnodes and some breast changes, so I had a mammogram, which turned out normal. Afterwards, I was sent for a catscan and then had lymphnodes surgically removed. When those came back benign, I was referred to a pulmonologist because the catscan showed scarring in my lungs. I was then followed for a year with two more catscans, one in which they said that they needed to do again while I was there. I am not TERRIFIED that all of that radiation will cause breast cancer. I had no clue how much radiation a catscan has. I am 31 right now, and so frightened. I do not have any other breast cancer risk factors (no family history of breast cancer or any reproductive cancers, healthy, active, etc.). I am currently breastfeeding my baby and found a bump, I was sent to a breast surgeon and thankfully, it turned out to be nothing. The breast surgeon told me she only sees breast cancer in women who have had hodgkins lymphoma because of radiation to the chest. She didn't specify if they receive a lot more than three catscans or not. I only recently became aware of how bad radiation to the chest is because of an article about catscans and breast cancer risk in women who receive it in their 20s. Sorry to write so much, but I am so nervous. I want to calm down, but I can't. :(Â  Log in to post a reply",
