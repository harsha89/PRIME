About 10 days ago I found a lump in the same breast that I had the partial mastectomy done on last October...Waited a few days, because I didn't want to 'cry wolf'... Anyway a couple of days ago, I called my PCP and he had me come in the next day (yesterday).  He found the lump w/o me having to tell him where it is... He immediately had his nurse contact our local hospital for a diagnostic mammogram, done this morning.  Tech sent it immediately to the radiologist in Lincoln.  Rad. said she could not see anything there, but ordered an ultrasound to be done, because sometimes a US will detect something the Mammo doesn't. Anyway, to shorten the story, the US tech found a pretty good sized seroma in the breast, and thinks that possibly it might be putting pressure on the tissues causing it to feel like a lump.  However, I am waiting for the report from the radiologist.  I am wondering, why a seroma would show up now (10 months since surgery)?  Have any of you had this experience? Would be interested in hearing your experiences, did they leave it alone to be re-absorbed in your system, did they aspirate it or put a drain in....how was it treated.. Vickie",

Just curious, did you have brachytherapy radiation or full external rad?  I have read that the brachytherapy can sometimes cause some uv burning, which leads to the seroma formation.......? don't know,.
