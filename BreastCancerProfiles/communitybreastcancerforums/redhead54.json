I know no one wants to hear this but I DO NOT believe in lumpectomies AT ALL.  If I would have had a mastectomy from the get go, I do whole heartedly believe I would never had have a recurrence.  Plus now I've had more opportunity for the little buggers to go elsewhere in my body. So, I do believe some woman are under treated.",
