She then handed me the phone and he told me that I had calcifications and that while the chance of malignancy is low, 10-15%, it is still high enough to require a biopsy in each breast. Further, he explained a bit about biopsies, saying a stereotactic would probably be best and possible for the right side, but he did not think it would be possible for the left side. The radiologist at the other hospital (we have two, only one offers stereotactic biopsies and I was at the wrong one for my mammogram) would have to view the films and decide. I was told a referral to a surgeon would be coming through shortly. I had been told I might need an ultrasound, so I asked about that, thinking more data is good data, but he said no, it was not needed. I was so stunned I couldn't think of what to ask him beyond that, but he was very good about asking the questions I did ask. Does anyone know, do coarse calcifications not show up on ultrasounds?",

BIRADS Category 4-B, suspicious. I was told a stereotactic biopsy is the preferred type, and this is possible on the right side. The left side, due to the positioning of the calcifications, cannot be done using this method. The radiologist is going to confer with my surgeon, I was told, to discuss the best possible alternative biopsy method. 1. What are the likely alternative biopsy methods (I won't hear anything for at least a week and am wondering)? 2. How much pain has anyone had with a stereotactic biopsy? I was told to take two extra strength Tylenol before the procedure. I am worried about tolerating the pain and holding still, which they told me I must be able to do for 45 minutes. I am claustrophobic, and holding still that long is going to be hard even if I am not hurting or confined in a close space--just being confined to one spot too long can trigger this, especially if it is an anxiety-provoking situation. I have asked for some anti-anxiety medication but am still worried about the pain. 3. I work one on one with a special needs student and it is very difficult and often impossible to find a replacement for me at work (there are only a handful of us that do this highly specialized work in our ten county region). The only hospital in my town that does the stereotactic biopsies does not do them on my one day off--Friday. They are done only on Monday and Wednesdays in the morning, when my student is very much depending on me to be at work to literally be the student's interface with the rest of the world. Consequently, I have scheduled the stereotactic biopsy on the right side on my first day off that falls on one of those days, which happens to be Veteran's Day, Wednesday, November 11. I was told the chance of malignancy is less than 15%. Is it a very bad idea to put the biopsy off this long? (My mammogram was done in late August the day before I left for a month of travel, and the radiologist seemed pretty calm about having me take care of this when I got back, which has perhaps lead me to be calmer than I should be about this, and I'm looking for a reality check here, ladies, if one is needed. At this point, I find on most days I am more afraid of the procedures than I am of the results. Well, until last night when I did some reading and all the search results here for \"coarse heterogeneous calcifictions\" came back with positive diagnoses. Now I am really beginning to worry!) (Neither one of these men was going to call the other until I got on the phone today and made it happen. They were each waiting for the other one to call. After the phone calls I made today, they are supposed to talk \"some time next week\" in a phone call initiated by the radiologist to the surgeon. FRUSTRATING.) Thanks so much for any help anyone can give! ~Cheryl Log in to post a reply",

They will then determine what course to take with the left. However, a problem has just come up with the right breast biopsy. The table used for the stereotactic biopsies has a weight limit on it. At the time I was scheduled I was just 5 pounds over the weight limit, and I figured I could drop that much weight in a month and be all right by the day of my procedure. On Friday I went with my cousin for her mammogram at the same facility and while I was there I asked some questions about my upcoming biopsy. As it turns out, they are very rigid about that weight limit. You cannot be even a half pound over the limit, or they will turn you away on the day of your procedure. The technician kindly showed me the scale, confiding she feels it weighs \"a bit on the heavy side\" and guess what? According to their scale that I have to get on the morning of my procedure, I am TEN pounds over the weight limit. There is NO way I can lose ten pounds in 11 days in a healthy manner, so I am going to have to postpone the biopsy. This means BOTH my biopsies are now postponed. When I first asked the radiologist back in August if it was safe to postpone because I was leaving the next day for a month long vacation trip, he said yes, but to get this done when I got back. And now I probably won't be able to get these biopsies done until December. I am starting to worry. I am also really getting serious about the weight loss. I know I need to lose the weight anyway, but the stress hasn't helped since I tend to eat when I am stressed. FRUSTRATING! Did anyone else ever have a delay in getting their biopsies done? I am starting to become frightened. I have been having some pain in both breasts, a pinching, burning pain that comes and goes, and this worries me.",

He said that waiting an additional four weeks was not a problem because the projected chance of malignancy is only 15% or less. If there is something there, it would be DCIS, and not invasive. We don't have to worry about it spreading during a 4 week period. However, while I had him on the phone I asked him about my left breast biopsy. Previously, I'd only had a message from his nurse. I asked what the plan would be, since that side cannot be done by stereotactic biopsy, and that I'd been told a plan would be made AFTER the right breast biopsy was made. He said the left side would have to be done surgically, with a wire inserted beforehand. He paused, and said, since the left side must be done surgically, and the right side has to be delayed to be done by stereotactic biopsy, it made sense to just do both while I was on the operating table, doing both surgically. I have an appointment to go in to see him on Friday. I was quite shocked by this news. From what I had been told, I thought the left breast was going to be a \"wait and check with a mammogram in six months\" type of situation if the right breast was benign. Now suddenly I'm heading into my very first surgery ever. I would love to hear thoughts and input on this. I live in a small city (28,000 population) and I don't think we have a breast surgeon here, this doctor is a general surgeon from what I can tell. I don't know how to ask without it coming across wrong. I feel like the ball game just got moved to a different venue. He is now not just the professional referring me to the radiologist who does many of these a year, but is now the person who will be doing a surgery if I move along this path. HELP! I've never had any kind of surgery before and am very frightened.",

On the right breast, because the cluster sits near the chest wall, he anticipates an incision about 3 inches long, to accommodate tunneling back to the cluster area, again marked by a wire embedded by the radiologist beforehand, and removing a large lollipop size chunk of tissue. Is this called a lumpectomy? When such large pieces are taken? Or is a lumpectomy only when actual lumps/masses are removed?",

      "Content": "CherylCC wrote: My diagnostic mammogram showed focal groupings of coarse heterogeneous calcifications in both my right and left breasts, and biopsies are recommended to rule out breast cancer. BIRADS Category 4-B, suspicious. I was told a stereotactic biopsy is the preferred type, and this is possible on the right side. The left side, due to the positioning of the calcifications, cannot be done using this method. The radiologist is going to confer with my surgeon, I was told, to discuss the best possible alternative biopsy method. 1. What are the likely alternative biopsy methods (I won't hear anything for at least a week and am wondering)? 2. How much pain has anyone had with a stereotactic biopsy? I was told to take two extra strength Tylenol before the procedure. I am worried about tolerating the pain and holding still, which they told me I must be able to do for 45 minutes. I am claustrophobic, and holding still that long is going to be hard even if I am not hurting or confined in a close space--just being confined to one spot too long can trigger this, especially if it is an anxiety-provoking situation. I have asked for some anti-anxiety medication but am still worried about the pain. 3. I work one on one with a special needs student and it is very difficult and often impossible to find a replacement for me at work (there are only a handful of us that do this highly specialized work in our ten county region). The only hospital in my town that does the stereotactic biopsies does not do them on my one day off--Friday. They are done only on Monday and Wednesdays in the morning, when my student is very much depending on me to be at work to literally be the student's interface with the rest of the world. Consequently, I have scheduled the stereotactic biopsy on the right side on my first day off that falls on one of those days, which happens to be Veteran's Day, Wednesday, November 11. I was told the chance of malignancy is less than 15%. Is it a very bad idea to put the biopsy off this long? (My mammogram was done in late August the day before I left for a month of travel, and the radiologist seemed pretty calm about having me take care of this when I got back, which has perhaps lead me to be calmer than I should be about this, and I'm looking for a reality check here, ladies, if one is needed. At this point, I find on most days I am more afraid of the procedures than I am of the results. Well, until last night when I did some reading and all the search results here for \"coarse heterogeneous calcifictions\" came back with positive diagnoses. Now I am really beginning to worry!) (Neither one of these men was going to call the other until I got on the phone today and made it happen. They were each waiting for the other one to call. After the phone calls I made today, they are supposed to talk \"some time next week\" in a phone call initiated by the radiologist to the surgeon. FRUSTRATING.) Thanks so much for any help anyone can give! ~Cheryl Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "CherylCC wrote: I went with my cousin on Friday for her mammogram. I recently had my own done and must have some biopsies done, and as a result of reading on this website I learned of 3D mammograms and that another facility in our community offers these, and as a result, we went there for her mammogram. (Thank you breastcancer.org! for that info!) My cousin's mother died when my cousin was only 3 years old, having been diagnosed with cancer while pregnant with my cousin. It was cancer of the spine, which most doctors now assume originally came from the breast, but my cousin insists it began in the spine. This was back in 1958-1961, so testing was not what we have now. My cousin has never worried about breast cancer risk and puts down in her medical records that there is no family history of breast cancer, but now I wonder... Anyway...while her mammograms were being done on the new 3D machine, a large white shadowy mass was clearly seen by both of us in one breast, which I think was also the breast that was painful when being compressed for the mammogram. The technician didn't mention it of course, nor did we ask her about it specifically because we knew she was not allowed to discuss the films with patients. The tech did say, don't panic if they call you back for more films because they can see a lot more on this machine and sometimes things look different and they need a closer look. Last year the standard 2D mammogram had a suspicious area, but the second diagnostic compression mammogram revealed it was just very dense fibrous breast tissue. What are the chances that the white shadowy mass is that patch of dense fibrous breast tissue? Has anyone seen what fibrous breast tissue looks like on the 3D mammograms? Thanks so much for any insight anyone can provide! We are stuck waiting for next week's phone call or letter for any information from the facility and just would like to know what might be ahead. My cousin is disabled and lives with me so I am very involved in her medical care. Log in to post a reply",

We knew she had dense breasts and we had seen a large white shadowy shape on the films which we thought might be the dense tissue and the cause for the call back (as it was last time), and so we were both surprised when the technician said that my cousin has calcifications and the radiologist had asked for additional imaging. I am currently awaiting bilateral biopsies for calcifications and somehow it never entered our minds that might be the issue here, too. The original screening mammogram done on Oct. 30, 2015, reads: DIGITAL MAMMOGRAM WITH COMPUTER ASSISTED DIAGNOSIS AND TOMOSYNTHESIS FINDINGS: Digital MLO and CC views of the breast along with bilateral breast tomosynthesis. The breast parenchyma is heterogeneously dense, which may reduce the sensitivity of mammography. Glandular pattern is stable. No mass or area of architectural distortion. Bilateral scattered round and punctate calcifications, largely stable from prior. One new more prominent group in the subareolar 6:00 left breast. IMPRESSION: BI-RADS category 0-incomplete, needs additional imaging evaluation. New microcalcifications anterior left breast. RECOMMENDATION: Patient will be returned for magnification views of left breast in the region in question. ***** After the magnified views were taken, the radiologist came to speak with my cousin and me. He said that a biopsy is needed. Because of the position of the cluster and the fact that her breast is very small, she is not a candidate for a stereotactic biopsy. He said an excisional biopsy would be needed. My cousin had so hoped to drop out at this point in the screening, but it looks like she is moving to the next step with me. She doesn't want to get the biopsy done and wants to wait three to six months for follow-up, but the radiologist said very likely there will only be more calcifications at that point and strongly recommended the biopsy.",

From all this reading, and utilizing the screening tool at the link above, it appears that my aunt, my father's only sister, puts my sister and I into a moderate risk category (although it did not specifically address what happens to that risk because she was diagnosed at about age 40; it only addressed our risk if she was diagnosed above age 50. In the strong category it addressed those diagnosed at age 40, but did not address second degree relatives like our aunt. Confusing!). In the moderate risk category, it states that genetic testing is considered unlikely to be very useful for us at this time. However, if my biopsy reveals a malignancy, then my sister will be moved into the strong risk category and genetic testing will likely be recommended for her. My sister is four years younger that I am, and has already been through a biopsy of her own; she has fibrocystic breasts, as does our mother. My sister recently did some genetic testing for ancestry purposes and we show a small percentage of Jewish ancestry. The screening tool shows a big jump in risk for those of Jewish ancestry. I am assuming our small percentage of Jewish ancestry is too small to count, but does anyone know how much this element factors in?",
