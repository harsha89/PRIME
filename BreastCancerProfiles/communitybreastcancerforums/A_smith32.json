There is a mass behind the nipple on the right measures 2.4 by 1.6 cm and is consistent with the mass seen by ultrasound. The enhancement characteristics are borderline there are no defining characteristics however and for that reason ultrasound-guided core biopsy is recommended. Impression: 2.4 CM well circumscribed lobular mass in the right breast 6:00 2 cm from the nipple it has somewhat hetero generous enhancement pattern There's more in the report from the other breast but it looks benign.
