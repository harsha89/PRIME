Blackstrap molasses. It is very high in magnesium. I took a tablespoon in tea before bed months and months ago for constipation during taxotere. It knocked me right out! Maybe because of the magnesium relaxing my muscles? I'm gonna start with it again. I'll report back with an update.",

When I was constipated I had crazy dreams usually involving me on an old timey battlefield packing the cannons with the cannon ball and stuffing it down. Crazy. What finally worked for me was several teaspoons of black strap molasses in warm water. It worked so well I asked my doc to put it in my medical record. Ha!",
