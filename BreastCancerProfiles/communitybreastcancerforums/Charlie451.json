I had a 2 cm triple neg tumor, right breast, no nodes, clean margins, surgeries in late May and early June. I am a 60 yr old Granny. I have read a little on this site about others experiences with rads but still pretty much in the dark about what to expect. I have LOTS of questions. In many ways I am more wary of rads than chemo. Are any of you going to ask about the 5 day external beam treatment? The criteria are pretty strict but there might be a chance. I do know that it is a great help to have a group like this.  I participated in the June 2007 chemo group on this site. Great bunch of folks and tremendous support through all. Linda",

I wonder what that would be? I'm sure I can use the Jean's Cream before I start or after I finish rads. Maybe if I smear it on my head my hair will grow. I have 6 dogs- all females, spayed. All except two were foundlings my daughter brought home. Most are border collies, shepherd/border collie mix, a hound, and a chow. They have their own little doggie community. We live in the country so there's plenty of room. I don't want to risk a house kitty with the dogs even though they stay outdoors. So great to be moving on with treatment. I think we have a pretty good group going here. linda",

I just got over one a week or so ago - thankfully my wbc was normal enough to kick it. I am loving the energy level I've got now. I do hope that the rads don't cause too much fatigue. Does anyone know if the fatigue is coming from your body trying to deal with more treatment or is it from thyroid or other specific reactions/problems?? My onc only says you can get tired - no details. I know I ask too many questions. I go in tomorrow for more calulations, etc. then start rads on Thursday, Nov 1. Hope everyone is set for Halloween.

My rad onc did such a good job of explaining things to me but no mention was made of cotton shirts, etc. The good news is that I've always hated bras and have never found one that fit well. Never mind that my generation was of the bra-burning sort. Consequently airing out won't be a problem for me. I discovered those minimal walmart fruit of the loom things a while back and they are comfortable. Love the humor. So glad to be this far along and past chemo that humor is a great relief!! Linda",

In the link to her post you sent she sounds pretty desparate to establish contact again. I wonder if the site administrators could help with information to contact her. I kinda know how she feels as the new format locked me out of my login for days. They finally fixed it after a tech complaint from me but I thought I was banished or something. In fact it is nice to get back to this group as there is no other place like it. I finished tx#5 of 6 for TC last Friday. Now I am checking off the familiar side effects day by day. I am really tired of reading and extremely tired of TV. The usual hobbies don't hold much appeal right now, either. I can't figure why such a slump when I am almost done with chemo. My best to all of you. Keep on keeping on. Linda",

Basically I figure I should not put anything into my mouth that isn't a fruit or vegetable or otherwise nutritional.

I am glad for all who are done with chemo, agonize with those dealing with treatment issues, and pray for all of us to find peace with a \"new normal\" in our lives. I have become so aware of others in our area who are dealing with breast cancer or other forms of the beast. In fact I am very worried about my own cousin (more like a sister) who had implants years ago. Recently, and maybe on more than one occassion, she has been told after having a mammogram to get a biopsy. She refuses to do it. Even after my experience and her own mother dying of cancer, she will not get the biopsy. Talk about stubborn. Or denial. Got any ideas on how I can break through this wall and convince her to get the biopsy? I am done with my last chemo, thankfully.  I am tired most of the time but done with it. Facing rads in a few weeks. So blessed to have two daughters who are with me every step of the way through. Linda ",

I go in this Wednesday for mark ups and CT to the affected boob. Rads should start about Nov. 1, I think. Cyndi - I am here to tell you that your energy level does return. I think once you kick the UTI you'll feel soooo much better. Shrink - The news of the vanishing tumor is so terrific!  Words seem  inadequate to describe how wonderful that is. I guess it made the onc's day, too. Garnetann - Congrats on finishing the taxol!  We are on almost the same rad schedule. Debbie K - You are on the way to rads, too! I am impressed by the how accurately they can program the rad \"beams\" to eliminate or minimize any damage to surrounding tissue. Bonnie- You are set for go on the rads, too. I know you will not be sad to see the port go. My onc has suggeted tamoxifen but I'm not too sure about it for me. Terry - That darned hole! Hopefully the surgeon will have some idea about how to fix it. All else sounds really great, though. I wish we had fall here. It's still in the 90s. Gracie- Creepy business about getting the port out but it is small potatoes compared to what we've been through. So glad you have NO lymphedema! I know I've missed someone -apologies.

Try anything that will take your mind off bc for a while if at all possible. I will also be praying for clear scans. My hair is really wierd looking, too. Mostly gray now and going about 14 different directions. It reminds me of the swirlling fur of a certain type of guinea pig my daughters had many years ago.

I taught art in high school for many years (retired now) and I always had a representative from AI make a presentation to the kids. Many wanted to go the 3D route but very few could actually do it. Kids will wear you out won't they? My oldest turned 30 last July and is a free spirit, traveling, working, belly dancing, sky diving (that one really freaked me out). About the rads - be sure to use alot of that prescription cream and get more if you need to. It sure helped me. Bonnie, great to hear you are taking CNA classes. That should be fulfilling work - plus you are virtually guaranteed a job. I am gls to know that you aren't experiencing any side effects from Tamoxifen. I think that is supposed to be the next step for me, too. Terry, that is so terrific you are taking watercolor classes! Just enjoy the medium and experiment a little. You can do so fun much stuff with it. I just ordered alot of oil paint and acrylic paint online. Hoping to get regular studio time going for one of my new year's resolutions. That is wonderful news about testing negative for Brac 1 and 2 genes. I will be thinking about you for your MRI. You know we have to face down this these tests for a quite a long time.

It hasn't really sunk in with me yet that I am actually finished as I'm so freakin tired - more than ever while on chemo.    I have been told different things about when the port comes out. First, I was told I'd have to keep it for a year and a half. Then the surgeon at the recent post chemo visit told me that she'd take it out after treatment ends. I assume after rads. It's really a nuisance to me as I am thin on top and that is clearly visible under the skin. Plus I am always hitting it on things. I guess I need to stand up for myself and demand they get the thing out asap.    Terry and Dville I have become so aware of all the others around here with bc. I know they say it starts in the cell dna with some kind of inherited predisposition to it but, wow, it seems like it's in our well water or something.    Garnetann, I read an old post of yours about how even a bc survivor can't make someone get a mammogram. It helped me understand why my nagging won't influence my cousin to get her biopsy as instructed by the mammogram she had. I do appreciate Terry's wisdom on that point, too.     Kathleen, I hope the problem is easily resolved wth antibiotics - like a bladder infection perhaps. We are all pretty emotionally fragile at this point regarding anything else wierd going on with our bodies.    Gracie, about what to do after all this treatment ends - I don't know about you but I feel complelled to do somehting to raise awareness of bc or enable more women to get a mammogram. Don't know yet how that will work into my life but I feel I need to do something.    Mainly I want to thanks all of you for being here and venting and giving advice during this ordeal. It is much appreciated. Hugs. Linda",

I really don't want to do rads in our little town as I've heard a couple of bad reports. I am really not wanting to do rads at all but I realize it's part of the whole breast-conserving package. Plus it kills the bc beast. Terry sorry to hear about the feet on fire misery. I read some where about taking L-Carnitine for nerve issues, tingling, numbness during chemo. I got a bottle of pills from our local health food store before chemo began. It has worked for me, I think. Never had problems. I don't know if that is the answer but it might help. Despite all you have been through with the draining wound from mammosite you can be glad you don't have to do rads now. I admire your spirit and the great support you have shown others on this site. Hang in there girlfriend, this has got to get better. Linda",

Someone , I believe Debbiek, posted here that she had returned to this group from the Nov rad group for the positive vibes and upbeat support. So true. Even though I don't post much anymore I pray for all of you. I will be especially thinking/praying about Shrink in her surgery today and B445 and her new \"spots\". I really like Dville's comment about seeking out tiny miracles. It is a very good exercise.  That would make a good theme for some art work. Of course I have to find time for that in between my part time job, keeping grandson, and another additional activity. Like Kathleen, I am starting the process of helping my 93 year old Dad move from his house to assisted living. He has been independent for so long. Still amazingly healthy for his age, too. Rads are gong well for me - I think it is due in part to a prescription cream the rad onc insists that I use twice a day along with a moisturizer they gave me to use with the cream. I flipped my chemo port in my sleep again. The best news is that they will take it out!!! I will call today to make arrangements with the surgeon. Christmas decorations are still in the attic but hopefully will be out soon. I will enlist DH and grandaughter to help. You all have a lovely week, Linda",

I didn't have taxol but I took vitamin B6, a natural diuretic, all through chemo and I think it worked to keep swelling away. Shrink, I have been praying for your healing. I know some one up there is hearing us. Hang in there with the new treatment plan. We are here for you. Cy, I have been doing the very same for you. Claim the miracles (great and small) that are promised us. My daughter's boyfriend's aunt was treated for brain cancer and is going strong now. I keep up with what's happening with all of you but don't get to post often enough. Still going thropugh rads. The machines will be down for programming tomorrow so I start again on Monday. Should be finished by next Friday barring an ice storm or something. So far so good with the rads. I, too, will be very interested to know the outcome of research presented at the San Antonio conference regarding hormone therapy for ER-PR-Her- cells. That would be the next step for me but I couldn't see the logic in it. Have a good weekend all. Take care if you are in the ice storm... Linda",

As we move on with our lives this news is a very sobering reminder of the nature of this beast. So I'm living every day as if it were a gift anyway. Great to hear from all and so glad things are going well health wise with everyone. I hope Bonnie's family illnesses are improved. Isn't it great to have hair! For some wierd reason I was still wearing my wig to my part time work until last week. I guess it was like a security blanket or something. To my suprise my manager gently suggested I take off the wig since that was the only place I wore it. I did and it was strange but liberating, too. I like my hair short , maybe a little longer than it is now, and I'm beginning to be OK with the gray, too. I saw my surgeon today. I was fully expecting she would remove my port. But noooo. All her port removal procedures are done in the hospital as an out patient! I have to have an IV! I think it is just a local anesthetic. I sure as heck hope so. This is crazy as I can clearly see the thing and could probably take it out myself. The thought has crossed my mind. I'm doing great: enjoying my art work, grandkids, work, etc. Hope all of you are as blessed, too. Linda",
