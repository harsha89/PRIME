Also..if it is cancer it's completely unrelated to the sarcoma on back as that cancer rarely metastasis & never to the breast..so in essence it would be 2 different cancers (should that be the case) Michelle Log in to post a reply",

Excisional biopsy came back benign (fibroadenoma). I went back to surgeon today due to pain and he sent me for ultrasound. this was not the same place that did my first imaging..so they didn't have any info on me. I explained that I just had surgery 4 weeks prior. The tech was very concerned with what she was seeing. She went to get radiologist. He came into my room 3 times and said I just don't know if what we're seeing is from your surgery or something new. Is this a typical finding a month after surgery? Can scar tissue look so daunting on ultrasound? Typically, You don't have an ultrasound 1 month after excisional biopsy but due to pain they did it early. Sorry so long. I feel more anxious about this than a month ago. Thanks for any help it info. Michelle Log in to post a reply",

      "Content": "michellesharii wrote: Hi there. I posted here approximately 6 months ago. I was being treated for a rare sarcoma in my back that was surgically removed (took 3 surgeries). In checking to make sure it hadn't grown down into my chest they did an MRI before surgery. MRI showed suspicious mass in left breast....then on to mammo & ultrasound (birads 4). Biopsy showed fibroadenoma (b9). 6 months later they'd called and said it was time for 6 month follow up. They did ultrasound then called next day and said then needed more pics. Did mammo. Nurse asked if I had family with me..I said yes, my aunt is with me today. Dr met us in a room and said the tumor had more than doubled in that 6 months and although biopsy was b9 6 months prior to this she was very concerned. Met with surgeon the next day. He said it has to come out ASAP. He said it could come back b9 or as cancer he didn't know but either way anything changing that much needed to be removed. That's been a week..I've been fine. I was sure it would still be b9 (biopsies aren't wrong!!!). My surgery is Tuesday the 22nd...and I am suddenly getting very scared and anxious! I'm sorry this is sooooo long. Anyone experience something similar? Had a b9 biopsy be wrong? Had a fibroadenoma suddenly start speed growing? Thanks in advance! Log in to post a reply",
