I am 39 years old.I just wanted to know if any of you diagnosed with BC ever experienced a large swollenÂ area in your armpit and pain in the armpit and chest? I have also been very tired for the last few months. I have a mammogram scheduled for this coming Thursday. Do mammograms show lumps in the armpits? I have always thought that cancer lumps do not hurt, but I have quite a bit of pain. Can you experience lump pain with BC? Thanks! Log in to post a reply",
