I have noticed on both breasts something firm inside the inner side of both breasts, these are in the same place on both so not too worried about that.  However, I also noticed that if I pull the skin/lift the breast up the skin there are dimples around these firm areas on both sides. This isn't noticeable unless I do this pulling of the (very loose) skin around my breast and the dimples aren't there if I lift my arms up, flex my muscles etc Any ideas?  I am 21 with no family history, Log in to post a reply",
