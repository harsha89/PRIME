The one I can remember is that a mass has grown in my right breast since my last mammogram a year ago. I also have one which appears stable in my left breast. I've been told I need a six month follow up. I also remember something about a benign opacity...whatever that means. What do I do? Should I have a second opinion? Just wait six months? Help!

I'm expecting to recieve a copy of the radiologists report in the mail tomorrow. Just today in the shower, I did feel a small lump, and another factor is that I've been on HRT for nineteen years. Tomorrow I'm getting the ball rolling. I'm calling a breast center in a large hospital. I live in a small community with a small community hospital. I think it's time to consult with a breast specialist. My Internist's exact comment was\" I apologize for obsessive compulsive radiologists\" I think I'm done with him. Thanks again",

I had an abnormal  mammogram, and on this Thursday I am driving three hours, to a major Breast Center to have further tests.  I'm having an Ultrasound, and a Diagnostic Mammogram. My screening mammogram results said--\"Predominately benign appearing opacity which has subtly grown since last mammogram\". Doesn't the word predominately mean most??? What about the rest of it? I'm very confused.... Do you think I will have to have a biopsy?  I'm having my husband drive me , just in case.... It's a very long drive. I've been reading this forum all weekend, and even though I'm probably very worried about nothing I want all of you to know that I'm very proud of you, and I'm in awe of your power and strength.
