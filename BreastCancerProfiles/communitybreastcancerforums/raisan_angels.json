      "Content": "raisan_angels wrote: Hi, I was suggested to also post this here. I've met with my oncologist and my BS separately. Since I am 31 with IDC with at least one node involved. They are recommending Neo-Adjuvant Chemo before surgery. There's very little information about it online. A couple studies but not a whole lot of data. I understand there is potentially a risk of up to 12% that would cause me not to be able to have surgery at all. This concerns me. Usually,this treatment is done to preserve the breast and be able to have a lumpectomy instead of mastectomy, however this would still not be an option for me I must have a mastectomy and probably still have all lymph nodes removed. I'm struggling to see why this treatment is better for me than immediate mastectomy. I'm one to look into research prior to making any decisions on my health. I'm concerned that I cannot find a lot of solid research on the topic other than it doesn't seem to make a difference whether chemo is done before or after. Questions: 1. Did you have Neo-Adjuvant Treatment prior to breast surgery? 2. Why did you have it? Lumpectomy/ Nodes / Something Else? 3. Was it successful or did the breast cancer turn to Mets? 4. If your daughter was given this treatment plan would you feel comfortable suggesting it to her? 5. Did this treatment prevent you from having any surgery after treatment? 6. Did you respond well to Neoadjuvant Chemo Treatment or did you need to stop and have surgery? 7. Are you under 40? 8. I\u2019ve read chemo is not effective and I\u2019m concerned going this route will lessen my chance of survival or increase my chance of Mets if I do not respond to the chemo Thanks for any feedback.

The mammogram and ultrasound were last Thursday. The technician and radiologist seemed extremely alarmed. They found the lump to be a suspicious finding, a smaller second lump I couldn't feel and an inflamed lymph node. The radiologist came back in explained the findings and told me that I was a Birads5 with a 95% likelihood of having breast cancer. The radiologist immediately did an US guided biopsy. They told me that the pathology report would be back early in the week and then we would move forward. I left the mammography Clinic in a blur. Since, I went through a lot of emotions but, I\u2019m handling it better now. I just want results. Though I called twice to the office there's no results from pathology. I have seen many people get their results on here in 24-48 hours. I'm very concerned they have found something bad and are putting off telling me. I'm 31 with a wonderful husband and two beautiful children. I want to kick cancer\u2019s butt as soon as possible but, I\u2019m becoming concerned it\u2019s beyond help. Thanks for any feedback. I\u2019m just a Mom with really little kids who wants to see them grow up.

I have large breasts that are lumpy sometimes so I didn\u2019t think much of it. I went yesterday and they did a Mamogram, Ultra Sound and another Mamogram. They radiologist came in and said I have a 95% chance of having breast cancer and I also have at least one inflamed lymph node. She immediately performed a biopsy and it should be back to me on wednesday. Once I went home Instarted to feel a lot of pain in my right leg and chest. It continued to get worse so I went to the ER thinking something went wrong with the biopsy. After spending the night in the ER they didn\u2019t find anything and I\u2019m still experaincing the pain. The biopsy sight I less painful that my leg and chest. I\u2019m scared.
