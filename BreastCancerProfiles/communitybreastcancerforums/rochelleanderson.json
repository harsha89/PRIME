    "Content": "rochelleanderson wrote: I'm having trouble understanding tumor markers! I've been trying to pick up on all things breast cancer but there's a lot I didn't know, do tumor markers mean something? I keep being told they aren't significant, there's a lot of room for error, but then why have I even been told what they're at? I know to depend on the scans instead, I don't even know if mine is high or 'normal' (for having breast cancer). I'm not sure if I'm making too much sense, but if I am, could someone help me out a bit? Dx 7/7/2011, IDC, 6cm+, Stage IV, Grade 3, mets, ER-/PR-, HER2+ Log in to post a reply",
