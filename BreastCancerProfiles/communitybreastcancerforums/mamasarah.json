I guess I feel that each of these milestones brings me closer to a return to the good life. I found that searching You Tube for \"headwrap how-to's\" turned up the best clips.  BTW check out the great video of a rehearsal for a T mobile commercial at Liverpool Station.  It brings smiles everytime I watch it.  We seem to be all over the place with digestive reactions.  Immodium is going to become a supplement for me.  My new favorite breakfast is Gerber Rice baby cereal.  And I am thrilled to report that I was able to start drinking coffee again after week 2.  Much love and best wishes to all of you as we begin another week of this trek.  Your openness, humor, kvetching, vivid descriptions, advice, etc. are lifesavers. ",

Martha - I had mastectomy, free flap reconstruction and port on December 8. The first few days are really tough, but each day is 100% better than the day before.  Now, almost four weeks out I'm pretty much back to normal except for incision healing.  I'm glad I did the immediate reconstruction because I'm not sure I would do it later and it does feel pretty normal, plus I have the flattest tummy I've had in forty years! Be well all, you are a great group! ",

I had a shaking, teeth chattering chill reaction to the Herceptin - not dangerous, but upsetting.  Nothing much from the TC. Last night had pain in my head and jaw, probably from Neulasta.   I'm getting my treatment in Houston at M D Anderson, even though I live in Virginia, but I'm getting worried about the schlep.  I went to Houston because they wouldn't give me Herceptin here, and the latest research seems to indicate it for even small and early.  I'm glad I was with people who know my case when I had the reaction, but, again, I don't think I can handle airport connections, long dashes through the airport and crowded planes.  Has anyone tried to get their treatment  location transferred?  Suggestions?  Also, has anyone tried Angel Flight?  I spoke with a friend yesterday who is a 12 year lymphoma survivor.  She suggested wearing a hairnet to bed (lovely!) to avoid having it all over the sheets in the morning.  My hair is really short now, but I don't want to add to the cat fur that already ends up all over the place.  Have any of you had shedding problems?  Also, she mentioned that her scalp hurt in the shower.   Love to all of you warriors!",

I'm through the worst of the SEs from tx#2 (TCH) of 6.  It's day 7 and I had more nausea, but less bone pain from the Neulasta.  I credit claritan for that, since last time time without claritan it was really bad.  Day 6 seems to be the crescendo for me - kind of a last  gasp as the poison leaves my body.  I used my lamaze breathing to get through it -  but no baby to make it worth the effort.  I don't notice anything really cumulative about this, so  here's hoping those of you going for #3 have an easy time of it. I have small bumps/rash on back and shoulders.  I was told that it might be the taxol/taxotere.  I'm trying not to pick at them but it's tempting. Foods that seem to work best are salty - V8 juice, soups, goldfish crackers. Water and sweet stuff tastes disgusting.  Haven't been able to have my coffee yet, sigh.  I wonder how much of my dull headache is caffeine withdrawal?  Dh wants me to stop eating red meat so I'm trying to eat it during these dark days in hopes that I will associate it with chemo. ",
