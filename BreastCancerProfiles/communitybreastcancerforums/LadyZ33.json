Even though I used it 3x a day! once after treatment, then before dinner, and then before bedtime, the day before the last treatment, I broke out into a rash; red bumps and itch. My point here is not to chastise yourself for not starting the Aquaphor early enough. I started on Day 1 and got the rash and itch anyway after four weeks. Someone on the internet cancer boards (can't remember which one) suggested using cornstarch over the aquaphor, so it wouldn't be so gooey. I did that for a couple of days, before the rash broke out. When I called the rad-onc office, the doctor told me DO NOT USE CORNSTARCH! for any reason; it can cause a fungus. So maybe it was the cornstarch that caused the rash and itch. But maybe not. In any case, I'm now done with treatments; it's four days since the last one; I'm slathered with Aquaphor day and night, as a friend suggested (she's been there; done that), and we'll see how it goes. ALSO, in response to someone on these boards, re: Aloe Vera, you MUST use 99% or 100% PURE Aloe Vera. All the others have additional ingredients, and God only knows how they affect radiated skin. I bought mine at Trader Joe's (and Wild by Nature, in my area.) The Aloe Vera is cooling, comforting, and healing. And it can't hurt you. GOOD LUCK to all of us. It's a misery. Lady ZÂ ",
