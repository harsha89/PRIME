I cannot deny it - a biopsy is an ordeal, but I did go through with it, and I was fine, in spite of being a little sore in obvious spots. A little ice pack, some music and relaxation, a loving and supportive environment (and if this is not directly available, you can get the support here - people in this site really care), and you'll be fine too. The hardest part is actually NOT the biopsy itself, but the three W's (waiting, whining and worrying) before the pathology report comes. It's like buying a lotto ticket, only this time you don't want a hit. Keep on venting, even whining! I'll listen, like a lot of people here. Save up on the worry part until you really have to. WIth my wishes for better days ahead, BC",
