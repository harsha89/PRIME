I really dont want to keep going through all this wondering each time about the side effects. anxiety level is high. they got the tumor out,didnt spread but they tell me their maybe cancer cells floating through out the body. im beginning to wonder going thru all this, will I feel another lump one day or maybe somewhere else another cancer? im so  confused with all this even talking to all doctors, reading,etc. ",

(I heard from someone in the Babylon breast coalition and she stated that 6 months some feel is a better option then the year on the chemo.   right now I have to also deal with a fallen bladder which is starting to bother me. when it rains it pours. so I may stop all chemo and get that attended to. so will need to think this all out. I wish you the best of luck  beccafish with all you went through. ",
