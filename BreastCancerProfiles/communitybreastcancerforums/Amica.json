I use one and I'm 20 years out from surgery! I can't carry heavy stuff because of lymphedema and back injury. Although I do lift cat litter. As far as then getting things up the stairs, what I do is take manageable amounts of stuff out of the bag with wheels and carry it up stairs or into the house. I'd rather take many trips up and down the stairs then blow up my arm. I do the same thing with groceries, small amounts, many trips in and out of the house.",

Let alone measures of tumor aggressiveness, S-phase or something, I don't even know if they do those tests in Ontario. probably cost too much. A monthly parking pass for patients at Juravinski is over $200. At my previous cancer clinic in the U.S. parking for patients was 100 % free. ;( ",

It sounds like you are getting high quality care, and that you are being a thoughtful proactive patient--thoughtful in the terms that you are keeping on top of things and asking the right questions, and that you have doctors who are effective and professional.

The physician would have to make a \"special access\" request with something called the Ontario PET Access Program, and she said she would not do that, that in her opinion regular CT would suffice. She said some patients go to the U.S. to get the PET/CT. I know the PET/CT allows for more specificity and accuracy, and can better identify malignant lymph nodes, so I was disappointed (and pissed off ). In the U.S. it's the health insurance companies you have to fight, here it's the government controlling and restricting access to procedures. I'm also thinking of asking for a Clinical Trial referral to a bigger Cancer centre in Toronto, because my onc said there were no clinical trials for me at the Juravinski Cancer Centre. It's all so complicated and I get exhausted doing all this advocacy for myself, but I know no one else will do it. Would Juravinski refer me to somewhere in the U.S. for the PET/CT, or would my former oncologist in the U.S. have to get involved and order the PET/CT and then I have to fly there and oh, boy, the logistics and cost are daunting. And maybe my MO is right, maybe CT is enough, I just don't know. ksusan, no entertaining banter is necessary :) I am grateful and appreciate your taking the time to post and voice your support.

However my oncologist said she would be willing to put through an Ontario PET \"Exceptional Access\" request for me with the Ontario government healthcare. . Thank you Colleen, I have complained about wait times in Ontario on here in the \"Rant\" section lol ! Looks like my wait times are not way out-of-line for Ontario, except for the delay of 26 days between biopsy and first visit with the oncologist. I actually live within 1 or 1 -1/2 hours drive of four cancer hospitals, but getting to Toronto would be a hassle. But I am considering them. So far the CT showed two additional enlarged lymph nodes that are metastatic in appearance near the large one by my collarbone, so that is three. The full body-CT did not reveal any lung or liver metastasis, or other suspicious lymph nodes. They did not do my brain. My bone scan is on Monday. No one has mentioned staging to me at this point, except to say I have advanced BC, ER+/PR-/HER2-. Oh, and probable basal cell carcinoma on a spot on my forehead. PET-CT would be very helpful for staging. So far, endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, and possibly surgery and radiation, have all been mentioned. Thanks InnaB-- that's helpful. I am just very anxious. Did I mention I have a sensation of being strangled, both literally and figuratively ? It is from the pressure of the tumors. Thanks for your replies--it means a lot to me! ",

Fear of recurrence is natural. However from what you have posted your treatment team is doing everything right, and you are getting excellent medical care, and statistically you have a good prognosis for many decades of No Evidence of Disease (personally I don't use the term cure.) And I can tell you that even a recurrence is not the end of the world. There are effective medications now that will prolong survival, and every year there are advances in breast cancer research. I think a Breast Cancer diagnosis is always going to hit you hard, there is so much unpleasant stuff to go through and deal with, and there are going to be the tearful sad days.

Usually the body destroys these cells. I wanted an excisional biopsy for my latest mass but no breast surgeon in Ontario would do one without a core biopsy first. I believe it is difficult to find a breast surgeon anywhere who will immediately do an excisional biopsy without a needle or core needle biopsy first. And even if an excisional biopsy is done, they often need to go back later to clean up the margins, so you may still have cancer cells released into the body between those two surgeries. Once cancer is in your body there is a chance that there are already cancer cells floating around in your blood and lymph fluid, way before a tumor is discovered. Most of these cells the body will destroy, and those that are left, that is what systemic chemo is for. Core and needle biopsies are the standard operating procedure. Think of the millions that have been done. If having a biopsy was a deadly mistake with bad outcomes, I don't they they would be the standard of care. I know I read of at least one study assessing this issue, in which they found that yes some errant cells were released into the body after biopsy, but the number of these cells DECLINED as the interval between the biopsy and detecting the cells increased. This showed the body was successfully destroying the cells. I will try to find that study and post the link.",

Oh, I found the pretzels, but now I got crumbs all over the waiting room floor sorryyy What helps me a bit with waiting: podcasts, watching the Tour de France, DVR of The First 48, audiobook of Maggie Gyllenhall reading Anna Karenina (it's long so it should last me through many a long wait).... Is there a prize for the gal who has to wait the longest? Shout out to Jadedjo! waving... cheers :) Amica",

I can drive myself crazy reading all the scary stuff on Google although occasionally I'll run across a research finding that gives me some hope. You are so right. Take it day by day. For me it is the fear of all that awaits me in the future and especially the UNKNOWN, since I have very few results yet, just a preliminary Pathology report. It's so easy to start catastrophizing the worst case scenarios. But then I need to realize even if the the worst case scenario arises that too will have to be faced and accepted. What other choice does one have? Hey I think someone is hogging the pool boys because I haven't seen one yet lol......

Yes I definitely prefer the doctors who are willing to go to bat for a patient! I saw my previous oncologist for 13 years, and I think when you become more than just a number to them and they know you more personally they are more likely to fight for you. This was my first visit with this young oncologist, and I think she was just \"following standard procedure.\" I meant nothing to her; I was just her 11 a.m. appointment. I used to work at a Cancer Center as a Coordinator of a specialized division, and I always went to the nth degree for patients. I remember once a nurse was complaining that I was ordering too many of a certain type of test, and the head M.D. of the Division overheard her, and he did say to her, \"What's it to you? You're not paying for it.\", backing me up. I was like --fist pump! I'll see what happens after they run the standard tests, if they are equivocal there will be more of a case for PET-CT perhaps.

I do deep breathing and something called \"toning\" several times a day when I start ruminating or feel extremely anxious. Toning is just glorified humming -- you breathe in through the nose and then keeping your face relaxed, lips closed and relaxed, make a long humming sound, one steady tone not a melody. You should feel your closed lips vibrate slightly. Breathe in again and repeat. Do this lying down, sitting, whatever. And after a few minutes it seems to have a calming effect. I do a fairly low tone, I find that more calming, but whatever comes naturally. Anything that will slow down breathing will engage the parasympathetic nervous system and your body and mind may feel more relaxed. Also, distraction--no matter how mindless. I've been watching lots of movies while I wait anxiously for tests and test results. Let us know what happens, Amica",

In my opinion the radiologists are pretty accurate at identifying suspicious lumps. But the definitive test will be a biopsy of the lump and lymph nodes. Good luck. Let us know how it goes. You really can't do better than M.D. Anderson so you know you will be getting world-class care. InnaB- I'm glad you're starting to feel a bit better. I'm still fighting to at least get a cursory second opinion, otherwise I need to get one from the U.S. which is a lot of hassle. But these Ontario cancer centers don't play around: once you are \"lucky\" enough to get into one, the attitude from the other centers is that you should realize how lucky you are, not bother them because they have their own patients to attend to, and just be a good patient at your own center. It's a very rigid, non-patient-centered system, that because of my decades of living in the U.S. I have trouble adapting to. If you live in a small town, like I do, you are stuck with your regional cancer center and that is that, you have very little chance of being seen or getting a second opinion at one of the larger centers in Toronto. I have my PET-CT scan on Tuesday. I am so afraid, not of the test, but the results. But better to know. I had the biopsy on my forehead for that lump last Monday and for some reason the soreness from the biopsy site makes my whole head ache so it has not been a good week :( I will be starting Ibrance soon. So I am glum.",

The PET-CT showed only the existing subpectoral tumors, no new area, so that is good news. I had a full hysterectomy/oopherectomy after the 5 years of tamoxifen, but before going on the 5 years of Aromasin, and it was probably my easiest, least disruptive surgery. I don't recall any side effects except I have had some bone loss, but that is mostly due to 10 years of estrogen suppression from the endocrine therapy. I was on Actonel for bone loss for decades but then had to stop because it turned out you are not supposed to stay on it so long. Now I'm back on endocrine therapy for the foreseeable future, and my onc actually took me OFF of my calcium supplement because I have high levels of calcium in my blood (which is a bad thing), and my onc is not sure why.",

At my last appointment my onc said once my neutrophils go back to 1000 it is her practice to re-start at the full dose again. But given my fatigue level, I may ask her if I could re-start at 100 mg. What bothered me more was her saying that if I can't tolerate the Ibrance, I would be only on the Letrozole. That's not my understanding! I thought if one medication doesn't work out, they try another one, like the Kisqali that you are on JoE777. Yes my pathology changed to PR negative. But even that got screwed up. First the pathologist put down negative, then he sent out an amended report in which it said PR positive. My oncologist didn't even notice! Like I said I really don't trust or like her. I had to call the pathologist and ask him which it was, he said he made a typing mistake and that it is PR negative, and that he sent out yet another amended report. My onc didn't even mention it, until I did. The other thing that really bothered me about my onc, is that I noticed a lot of women in my situation are on bone builders like Prolia. So I took the initiative to visit a rheumatologist I saw about eighteen months ago, and she prescribed Prolia injections to prevent further bone loss. I said that the rheumatologist had said my onc could phone her, since proper consult notes were not sent to the rheumatologist. My onc actually said 'no', she wouldn't do that! Not even a 5-minute phone call to make sure everyone is on the same page! It feels like I am having to act as my own patient care coordinator, and I believe that that is the role of the medical oncologist. I saw online that my onc just got married in early September, maybe she is distracted and just doesn't give a s**t. Sorry I'm going on and on---I'm just so frustrated. I feel quite dismal.  ",

Cannot even get a therapist in Canada, several months of wait times just to see one, very few are taking on new clients, and you have to pay-out-of-pocket. with love and compassion for all of my fellow ladies in waiting, Amica",

My onc is applying for \"special access\" for me to get a PET-CT scan, because the Ontario government healthcare system will not fund PET-CT scans for breast cancer--which I still find disgraceful. She said it takes about a week to find out if you are approved, and then a couple of weeks delay to get the test. If the application is turned down and they frequently are, there is one private clinic that I can pay for one out--of-pocket. PET-CT is standard of care everywhere in the world and in the rest of the Canada; I don't know what is wrong with Ontario. I predicted that despite finding the lump in mid-June, I wouldn't start treatment until September, October--- unfortunately it looks like I will be right.  Amica",

He's 94 and I am in Ontario so that he doesn't have to live alone, he has some health problems. And now I am sick. We don't have extended family. Tests take longer in Canada, but I would hope eventually they will get done. I have partial pathology results, they said the rest will take a month or more. Since my last go round at this was 20 years ago, I don't know if tests have gotten more complicated and take longer now, or is it just Ontario. I would have to pay out-of-pocket in the U.S. The wait for my initial oncology appointment on August 9 seems like an ETERNITY. take care, Amica ",

I will note that my oncologist never could be bothered phoning me with the PET results, and I was a wreck waiting over a week for them. I had to find out by driving an hour each way to my family doctor who get's cc'd on test results. Turns out the results were in the end of last week and no one could be bothered letting me know. I would very much like to switch oncologists, (I can't switch cancer centers in Ontario unless I move), but I'm afraid of getting someone who is even worse (if that's possible lol.) JoE777 - How high was your calcium level? Did it get lowered? I hope so. I know it can be dangerous, so far I am in the mild range of hypercalcemia but it keeps going up, and of course my oncologist has no clue why. So another thing to worry about.... Wishing everyone well :)",

Twenty years ago when I was 39 , I would not have trusted or listened to my gynecologist who upon discerning a lump in my breast said, \"oh you're too young to have breast cancer and you have a history of fibrocystic disease in your breasts, so it's nothing to worry about.\" Thus I delayed a year until I could clearly feel a hard lump in my breast and insisted on getting a mammogram. By then it had spread to my lymph nodes. Sadly I am facing nearly the same situation currently. As a 20 year survivor a new mass by my collarbone has been discovered that upon ultrasound was described as \"suspicious for a pathologic lymph node\" and recommended for a biopsy, which my family doctor is being exceedingly slow in scheduling because she doesn't seem to understand that ER/PR + cancer can indeed reoccur many years later, especially if your first incidence was age 40 or younger.",

So it will be September or even October before I even start treatment for advanced breast cancer. So 3 to 4 months from showing doctor the lump until treatment---any treatment. Has anyone else experienced delays like this or am I just unlucky? Or maybe it's just slow because it is advanced BC and not early stage. (I contrast this with my first breast cancer, found lump late in August, all surgery completed by end of September, started Chemo beginning of October.

I think they base it on if you have symptoms, like headaches, vision changes. My onc and I debated whether or not to do a brain CT, and first she said yes definitely. I have a lot of headaches, but it's not new. And all this radiation, I wanted to reduce it; she kind of left it up to me which is kind of scary. She said we could always do it later on if indicated. An article in PubMed states that \"It is generally accepted that MRI (contrast enhanced) is superior to CT scan (contrast enhanced) in the diagnosis of brain metastases\" so I don't know why CT is always being done instead, they are saving money again I guess.

The sedation helped a lot, and if you feel anxious I would insist on it. You are the patient, they do not know your level of anxiety. The actual procedure did not hurt, since they used local anesthetic. In fact you can't really feel them doing anything, the whole area is numb. And it did not take long. In my case the radiologist took 10 samples and it probably took about two minutes. They laid a wet cloth over my eyes to block from the bright lights and also so I couldn't see anything, thankfully. I am actually more sore a few days later, but I think it is from lymphedema and maybe only a little bit from the biopsy. My post-biopsy soreness is about a 1 or 2 on a pain scale of 1 to 10, so not extreme, more of a discomfort than real pain. I hope that helps. Wishing you well, let us know how it goes.",

So I would take a measured look at the statistical probability of risk into account in treatment decisions, and not skip treatments just because a test showed I had a low risk of recurrence. I would just maximize all my treatment possibilities. Probabilities are just that. You might well be that one woman in a thousand who will develop a recurrence if you skip a particular treatment. Statistically, that treatment may not be necessary for the other 999 women, but for you it could be. I had all the treatments available to me at the time when I first had breast cancer 20 years ago. I WAS at low risk for recurrence. There is a fairly low probability of having a recurrence after 20 years seemingly free of disease, but that's the situation I seem to now find myself. :(",

Something physical may help a little: Sometimes I do push-ups (from the knees) and on the exhalation I yell \"F* Cancer\". I do sit-ups and vocalize \"I hate you I hate you I hate you\" to the cancer. It would be great if we all had access to a therapist. I don't know if those resources are available to you. But if you feel like you need someone to vent to, maybe that would be helpful. I haven't even had my first appointment with my oncologist but I am prepared to ask for whatever mental health support services are available. Strong emotion is natural and I do think it is like a wave, it rises and abates. Need to ride the wave, but try not to let it capsize you. take care, Amica",
