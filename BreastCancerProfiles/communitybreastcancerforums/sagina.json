I'm 41 and not sure if chemo has thrown me into early menopause? Anybody else? I agree with all of you, the thought of radiation seems to stress me more than chemo did, but I think I might have been numb when chemo started....now somewhat clear headed I have to much time to think. How is the fatigue factor for those of you already in treatment? I heard that larger breasted women suffer more symptoms, burning, etc, due to folds in skin etc.  Has anyone else experienced that?   ",

Motherofthree~ I am large breasted, not feeling the hardening yet, but was warned that I will.  On my 5 one nope my 4th one, darn residual chemo brain.....wonder if the amount of tissue has something to do with how quickly that happens. I'm going to buy Lotto tickets too!!!! How fun!!!!!",

So I was putting my PJ very soft cotton shirt on yesterday evening and I leaned over the bed for something and couldn't help but see my very two very different boobs!  I had a lumpectomy they classified as a partial mastectomy and boy did I see that yesterday.  How much does radiation shrink the boob? and yes Happy Mother's day to all, and may our chemo brains return to normal soon! ",

So I buy 33 bingo scratch offs.  I get to the treatment center, in the car, excited to \"scratch\" off my six tickets, and darn if the scratch off doesn't have 4 bingo cards on it, then I have to scratch the caller's numbers, and then go and \"play bingo\" scratching every number from each card.....the quarter was too big had to switch to a dime, my hand was hurting after ward....I was cracking up thinking to myself, I just wanted to scratch and win....not work for it!!!! Well like cancer treatment , we have to work for it feel some pain, feel some burn! I get my six treatment, the techs really don't like the hard as a rock third boob I'm growing, and take a while to line me up, re- mark me in a a couple of places, and told me I was due for x-rays.  So I spent a little longer in the \"I'm being held up hold your arms\" position. THEN, I head home to get out of the itchy camisole I'm wearing, as not to wear a bra, and the DH calls to see if I want to go for dinner, that sounded great.  I get home before him, take the itchy cami off and decide, well, they said no bra so now's a good a time as any....got in his truck, pulled out of the bumpy drive way...and I must have registered on the Richter scale, I couldn't even hold on to my boobs with my two hands!  I needed four!  Needless to say the seroma causes pain but when the tissue is all sitting in a bra it doesn't hurt so bad, but when they were flailing in the wind in the truck....OUCHIE!!!! We hadn't gotten to the end of the street when I told him, I can't do this, take me the store, I\"m buying a bra! Two sizes and a cup size bigger, and friends, then I'm out of cup sizes.....and an explanation to the clerk - can I leave it on if it fits....and ahhhh I was ready for dinner, finally....  I got home so exhausted I didn't even turn on the computer.  Maybe I should stress out more?

Call the other people you are behind with and ask to set up payment plans.  If you have a home, make that first....the water, electric, and cable don't do you a bit of good without the house....learned that lesson too!

Some chemotherapeutic agents (adriamycin being the most notable) can be quite toxic to the heart muscle. By measuring the MUGA ejection fraction periodically during chemotherapy, oncologists can determine, on an ongoing basis, whether it is safe to continue with the therapy, or whether certain medications need to be stopped. The MUGA scan is accurate and reproducible enough to detect subtle, early changes in cardiac function that might easily be missed by other techniques. It is a highly effective, noninvasive means of monitoring one of the worst side effects of chemotherapy, and allowing that therapy to be delivered more safely and effectively than would otherwise be possible.",

I also think of the stars wars contraption as a time warp machine.

To cover up the parts that should never be exposed to UV rays, ouch I moved when I laughed!!! So radiation....as I posted on facebook, first they fry my brain with chemo, now they fry my......lol.  Yep you got the point.  Radiation is the science of delivering the maximum amount of radiation possible without causing major damage to organs while killing the crap out of any cancer cells left - that's my definition.  The machine used for this is something straight out of Star Wars.  As I was laying there, I really started to think how scientists and mad science fiction film makers probably have been meeting every month in a secret society, sharing ideas - probably called the fraternal association of research & theatrics, you know F.A.R.T.  I mean the machine itself I thought was going to start talking, as if Tom Sellecks \"Kit\" found a new job, thank goodness it didn't I might have made that 15 foot leap down.  The machine has a glass pane staring at me, with quite the reflection I really didn't care to see, I am scary looking.  Then the arm rotated all the way around for more x-rays, and all of the sudden the silver part of the machine comes around and there in front of my eyes was a very clear reflection of some horrid looking creature, bald, big, and with marks a lot all over, oh what a sight, so from that moment on -  like how I watch scary movies, I closed my eyes, tight!",

For me radiation is more a chore than anything else, going every day, trying to keep the skin from touching...etc.  Happier days are coming soon, and if this gives me a little bit more of chance to never do this again, then that's ok with me.",

I scheduled by rads last thing in afternoon so I could go home and nap if needed.  The fatigue is like when you have a really busy day and you go home and sit down and fall asleep in the chair.  When I wake up from a nap I don't feel groggy at all. Make sure to get to bed at a decent hour, I don't and I think that's why the fatigue is so bad in the mornings.  I good after I get moving.

My MO scheduled an appt toward the end of rads anticipating having to step in and stop if side effects were bad. She was really surprised and asked what I did.  I told her exactly what the RO asked me to do - only use creams he gave me, dry skin all the way after showers, keep the skin under breast dry etc.  Hope this helps. ",
