She is my best friend and I have been by her side through it all. This is the hardest thing I have ever endured and I can only imagine how it must feel for you all. My mother has been on several chemos and just got her scans and they were not good. Her breast cancer mets has spread to bones,lungs and now liver. It scares us to know that the liver is involed. She has been fighting for 4 years with the reoccurance. Originally diagnosed 20 years ago and had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. thought she was good till 4 years ago.  Doc says it will never go away but we will do what we can to slow it down and maintain a quality of life. She just finished the new drug Halavan but didnt work for her. We are so disappointed. She is suppose to try the drug Doxil and he said the side effects will be harder than Halavan. She is at the point now where the SE have been difficult to handle now. So the thought of it getting worse is hard to take. I know she has been thinking about not doing chemo anymore but then she changes her mind. Going back and forth this past week. Its very hard to accept this especially when your only 64 yrs old. Wasnt the plan for after retirement. I keep telling her to join the blog or group so she has a  way to get it all out and vent and question others feeling the same way. But she says no and wants to be private. I feel she has so much to say but she holds it in to protect me.  If anyone has any info or encouraging stories about this chemo Doxil, please let me know. I will keep trying to get her to join or at least read this. I love her so much and will be here for her always . ",
