My whole chest felt like my healing had regressed by weeks I was so sore. My skin felt numb and crawly and expanders felt harder, more painful and foreign than they had in awhile. Before going into infusion 2 I asked for norco to help with the expander and back pain which I think is from neulasta. I also bathed several times in Epsom salt (use ALOT of salt to detox) to relieve some discomfort and they were helpful. I also got my stupid period much to my dismay, heavy and annoying. I thought for sure it would leave for good for awhile. Hope you're able to get some relief, you will find the comfort you need in the next few months. Get the norco from your MO, it's the only way I've gotten through this week! Tylenol, NSAIDs and Claritin didn't cut it for me with bone pain. Probably helped some but not completely. Hugs to you.",

Not sure if this is a common side effect or not? Was nauseous this morning and vomited and felt a little better but the cramps are still kicking. I have norco to help with some neulasta back pain but almost made the stomach cramping worse. Has anyone had cramping? I don't have diarrhea or anything. Yet 😳. I also got my stupid period, which I was hoping to not have to see this month, blah. Cramps are not associated w that though. They seem more intestinal.  lost a good amount of hair, but still have alot with the cold caps, they seem to be working but it's still early. I can wear a small ponytail or hat and no one would know I'm going through this. Definitely some spots thinner than others but all coverable so far. ",

I can hardly move without muscle pain like I've been lifting weights. And just when I thought it would be safe to start working out, nope.
