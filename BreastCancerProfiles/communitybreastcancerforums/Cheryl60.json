Yukky side effects I was not willing to live with on the very small chance that it would keep me from getting this again in 5 years. I made this decision however, with great thought and contemplation and lots of research.  Each of us has to come to this type of decision on our own.. Each of us is so different in this journey we are all on.  As I said on another post, after we are dx'd with this BC, our heads are in such a dither and our world has been turned up side down, it does take a while to come to grips and research all about this.  Of course I have never been the type of person who just takes anything at face value, i HAVE to research on my own and make up my own mind.  I still have a hard time accepting that most drs. think treatment for BC patients is a one size fits all...Just can't go along with that.  So far, so good.  I am feeling more and more like my old self as each month goes by.  Hopefully this will keep on for good and NO MORE problems with BC. Hopefully NO more probs with BC for ALL of us!  Cheryl",
