      "Content": "Resilient wrote: I had surgery last week and when the doctor tried to remove the nonabsorbable prolene stitch today, it snapped apart and most of it was left in the incision.  I was told the only way to get it out was to \"reopen the incision under general anesthetia.\"  My other choice was to watch the incision as it heals to see if the prolene stitch (monofiliment) starts to come out by itself and could then be pulled out. They also said it would look OK cosmetically if it were left in. I work with TV with close-up shots and got this type suture so I'd look OK on camera.  This is my career and I'm worried. Is it OK to have the prolene stitch left in?  What are the risks? Log in to post a reply",
