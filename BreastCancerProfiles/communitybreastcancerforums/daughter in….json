      "Content": "daughter-in-law wrote: I have recently found this website in my searches for info on BC. My dear mother-in-law is 78 yo and has had a palpable lump in her breast for three years. She was afraid to go to the doctor and said she was just going to let nature take its course. Over the last month, a nurse saw her breast during a routine ekg and told her to get a mammogram. The mammogram showed a large mass (over 6 cm) that was highly suggestive of invasive ductal carcinoma. She was scheduled for a biopsy-she had a fine needle biopsy- and when she finally told the family, I accompanied her to the doctor to receive the biopsy results. The doctor said that the biopsy showed that her tumor was in fact cancerous and has recommended a mastectomy with an axillary node dissection in two weeks. When I asked what else the biopsy showed, he said nothing b/c the amount of tissue sampled was so small. There are no further tests scheduled before the surgery. Is this unusual? I am wondering if the reason he is proceeding quickly without further tests is possibly b/c the tumor has already begun to come through the skin. My mother-in-law has had some watery, bloody discharge from the surrounding skin (not the nipple) and also has some blisters. Any ideas out there on how bad this is? Log in to post a reply",

This is a very scary thing for our family as it is for everyone else's out there.My MIL does indeed have all her marbles and is totally competant. But her age does worry me, even though she is extremely active for someone in her late 70s. There are a couple of other female relatives around, but she and I are very close and I will help her any way that I can. I will probably be back with more questions following the surgery, especially after we get the lab reports. Thank you again for your help. nancy",
