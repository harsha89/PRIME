Even though she got a good biopsy (25 cores), cancer can still be lurking when there is a radial scar and she prefers to make sure nothing is there.    2. My mammogram initially revealed an architectural distortion which was confirmed at biopsy to be a radial scar.  In that case, removal is recommended.  If there had not been architectural distortion on the mammo and they found a radial scar incidentally at biopsy, then you might watch it for changes instead of removing it.  So apparently, the architectural distortion is the reason she's recommending removal.  I have a consult with surgeon in the morning.",

      "Content": "Mar 16, 2009 05:28AM - edited Mar 16, 2009 03:11PM by mrs-mjt I wanted to share about my MRI guided biopsy on March 10 in case others are looking for info on this procedure as I was.  It was done via a vacuum-assisted device.   My situation may be unique because I received sedation (versed) and a pain killer (fentanyl) through my IV plus the lidocaine they shoot into the breast so I didn't feel a thing!  I was in la-la during the 2 hour procedure and glad to be there!  I did hear radiologist talking to me when they nicked my skin and when she inserted the needle, etc. but must've \"slept\" some as the procedure just flew by.  After tissue was removed, they put in a metal marker and then I had a mammogram to confirm its placement.  After the biopsy, my chest was wrapped in a pressure guaze bandage (like a big ace bandage) and I kept a ice pack on my chest the ENTIRE DAY.  I bruise very easily and still can't believe that I have absolutely no bruising or swelling so icing is VERY important.  My brother does MRI's in another state and they do not give their patients sedation whereas the facility I had mine done at said they always give sedation because it is a long procedure (2 hours).    I'm not one who likes to take medicationg but I'm glad I did in this case although perhaps it would've been fine without it, too.   Anyway, I read of another poster's very negative experience with MRI guided biopsy on this board and thought I'd share another perspective to encourage those who need to have this procedure done.    I have radial scar formation which is B9 so waiting to hear if I need it removed or can just keep an eye on it.",
