No one at my cancer center ever advised that dental work would be an issue after being on this drug and found out on my own a year later about the possible necrosis with extractions. Turns out I need a tooth extracted now and I'm freaking out......anybody out there who has successfully had a tooth pulled without the jaw damage? I don't know what to do....dentist says it has to come out and cancer center says I shouldn't have it removed. Please someone, anyone, tell me they've had a successful extraction.
