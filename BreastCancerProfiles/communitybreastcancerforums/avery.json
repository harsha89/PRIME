      "Content": "avery wrote: I've spent a lot of time today poking around this website and more specifically the stage iv forums after coming to post a question earlier. I was trying to find some people in similar spots to me to see how they went about treatment, and noticed some stage iv women had a mastectomy before chemo? When I was diagnosed, this was never really presented as an option for me, only chemo and (possibly) radiation. Would there be a reason for that I wouldn't have a mastectomy, because it's stage iv and wouldn't get rid of all the cancer? I'm not exactly looking for it as an option, it's more out of curiosities sake as I'm already into chemo treatments. Sorry Â if this is common knowledge - I'm still getting the hang of things!
