I've also developed many small hairs all over my breast since it has grown, I have plucked a couple out and there seems to be 2-4 hairs coming out of every follicle, they also seem to be quite brittle. I've also been experiencing pains in my breast and under my armpit on the same side. I saw a doctor approx a year ago, about pains in my armpit (before any breast growth) and he told me that everything seemed ok. Log in to post a reply",
