About 10 years ago I had a biopsy on my left breast that was a benign cyst. Over the years I have 3 other identified small likely-B9 cysts in that same breast that get monitored by US regularly. No concerns there. In 2015 my mammogram showed scattered calcs in both breasts. I go every two years for mammo, so went back for my recheck in May and the calcs in my left breast had increased and there was a cluster with some faint linear formation in outer upper quadrant. These were characterized as \"punctate and irregular. An associated soft tissue density cannot be excluded.\" So, I went for a stereotactic core needle biopsy, 12 gauge needle vac assisted. That procedure was not bad, by the way. Not a barrel of laughs, but nothing to dread. The results I got back this week in the pathology report say \"Atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia; calcifications associated mostly with benign breast tissue, and focally with atypical ducts... partial involvement by cribriform change and a monotonous cell population... E-cadherin is positive in the atypical ducts but negative in the atypical/hyperplastic lobules.\" I'm scheduled for a surgical biopsy this coming Monday, ultrasound assisted. My doctor assures me there is only about a 5% chance of upgrade, but what I've researched says it is maybe more like 10-20% chance based on equipment used in the needle biopsy. Anyway, I know the best place to ask questions is my doctor, and I know to stay away from a lot of the information on Google, though I do look at things that are studies, or information from reputable organizations. I don't really have anybody to talk to so thought I'd maybe ask some \"over tea and scones\" questions in this forum. 1. Does anybody have experience with ADH e-cadherin positive, cribriform, and is that of any significance as far as upgrades go? 2. What about ALH e-cadherin negative -- is that less of a concern due to the e-negative? Or is lobular just usually negative? 3. The surgeon left a marker in my breast. Is that what the ultrasound will be looking for? For some reason my biggest anxiety on this surgery is that they will put wires in while I'm awake. I've read some comments about that being freaky, and I had a dream about it last night. (Though in my dream French President Macron was doing the surgery, so that was interesting.) Do they need to put in wires if there is already that marker inserted? 4. How do they know what they need to take (ie how much) in order to get the right place, if the calcs are in B9 tissue and there is nothing palpable? Does the flesh look \"different\" in hyperplasia? Or are they basically just going in for a sample of some size (what is a typical size?) I am not overly concerned with the scarring or shape, I'm more concerned that they will miss something. Any little bits of info you might have would be welcome, as would just a hello. I'll pour you a cup of virtual tea. :) Thanks, and have a good day. Log in to post a reply",
