And I got the results back from the SNL biopsy last week....there were 3 lymph nodes removed and one tested positive.  I see my surgeon tomorrow before I go for my treatment, so we will discuss what's next at that time. Right now, I am so emotionally, mentally & physically tired....will be back later to check in on everyone.....It's time for a nap! ",

My main concern is how my body will react, since I also have fibromyalgia. I'm doing the chemo first, then surgery, followed by radiation for 6 weeks. I'm so glad to have some new team mates that understand. ((((Hugs to all))))",

I feel like I'm about to jump out of an airplane without a parachute! My daughter is going with me today and other family & friends are signing up to go with me. And I'm so grateful for their support. Hubby will get his turn, too. For now, he's the babysitter for grandkids...lol. Wishing all of you a blessed day!",
