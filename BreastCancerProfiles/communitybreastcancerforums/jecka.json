So now I feel like not only do I have to worry about \"the aliens\" in my breast, but that I'm going to have to fight to get answers, it's just so stressful",

Had a mamo in January for lump in right breast, everything was good had an ultrasound of left breast, just the lumps not nipple area, lumps where undetectable even though they are palpable by everyone, radiologist was an idiot and said completely untrue and ridiculous things to me including a comment about my age I'm 34 so that somehow makes me less of a concern. because of my complete lack of faith in this radiologist I have pushed to see a breast surgeon and it is scheduled for July 6th.   so questions:(there are more questions but I swear my mind went blank the moment I started typing) any experience with palpable lumps not seen on ultrasound being cancer? retracting nipple info/experience? if this were your body what would ask from a surgeon, expect to be done in a second opinion/look? any other info to share?   thanks   Log in to post a reply",

And the obsessive need to feel the mass and everywhere else is not helping but can't seem to not check and my right armpit is swollen but this doesn't do me any good it's not like I'm suddenly going to know know answers or that the mass is going to suddenly disappear since I checked an hour before! One of my friends, I've only told my mother and MIL and 2 friends who's help I've needed with child care, is making me crazy sending me articles every couple of hours. Friday seems s o far away I just hope the radiologist says something that day instead of making me wait over the weekend after waiting 7 days to even get testing done. Does the radiologist usually look right away or will a tech take pictures and I'll have to wait more?",

I feel a bit more calm now knowing that Friday I will at least know whether I'll need a biopsy or not. It's not much but it's something and every little bit helps in this crazy waiting game.",

She wanted me to be seen the first of next week (today is Friday 1/6) unfortunately even after trying to fit me in I can't be seen until next Friday. 2 of my aunt's on my father's side have had breast cancer, I don't know a lot of specifics because I don't really know that side of the family at all. Don't really have a specific question per say just wanting to feel like I'm being heard and my fears are being validated, I know my loved ones mean well but if I hear another oh you're fine or a story about someone who knew someone and it was all fine I may scream Thabks Log in to post a reply",
