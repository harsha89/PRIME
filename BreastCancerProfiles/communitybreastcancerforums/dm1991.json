This second spot could not be reached so now I'm having this other procedure. I've heard that the wire placement is extremely uncomfortable. Can anyone let me know if theirs were bearable. Thanks so much. Dawn Log in to post a reply",

I feel like I've been on an emotional rollercoaster for about three months now. I'm just wanting this to be over already. Thanks again, I'll be sure to ask about getting Lidocain to help. You ladies are a godsend. I'm getting it done May 15. Please keep me in your thoughts. Dawn",

The same thing, they said I had abnormal cells. I was so scared and I thought the worst. I had a procedure done in the office involving cryosurgery. They actually freeze the area of cells. It was nothing. I was in and out of the office fast and at my follow up a month later it was all cleared up. I had to do a follow up pap every 6 months for a year and it never happened again. You might just be having two seperate things going on at once. I know it's hard not to worry. Wishing you the best. Dawn ",
