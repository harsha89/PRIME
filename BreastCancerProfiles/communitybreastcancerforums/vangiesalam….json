I just had an unexpected total mastectomey left last april 10, 2008 .  after a month the final result from the patholgist was released and it stated there that its a low grade phyllodes tumor. What does it really mean?  Is it a cancer? or just a tumor? The medications i have taken is only painkillers and my surgeon did not require me of any chemotheraphy or any other anti cancer drugs.. and will there be any recurrence? as i will be monitored monthly in 1 to 2 years time..Im a little shy to ask my surgeon but im having some questions in my mind.   please advise.. thank you very much and god bless..  Vangie",
