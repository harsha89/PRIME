The ultrasound and mammogram were negative. Had a MRI in Dec also negative. I finally insisted they take the lump out this spring and it was my original cancer back. Even the MRI missed it. I just had skin and nipple sparing BMX in May with anatomical implants with Alloderm. Alloderm helps with radiated tissue as does fat grafting. Iimplants are a much easier procedure than natural tissue, however you may need subsequent surgeries. You may with natural tissue as well. Pros and cons to both. You will have to look into it. There is no right decision, and you have choices. There are women on these boards who are happy with both implants and natural tissue. Most of us do fine either way. I am happy with my implants and wanted the least invasive surgery possible. I figure if they fail I always have the option for natural tissue surgery. I have healed with no complications and I have full feeling in the skin of both breasts.",

I felt a new lump in the same breast a year ago. Had mammogram, ultrasound both said no cancer. In Dec had MRI which also said no cancer. I finally insisted they take the lump out in March, and turns out it was the original cancer back. Just had BMX on May 17th. Skin, nipple sparing direct gummy bear implants over the muscle. So far recovery has been relatively easy, just some soreness where the drains are in. Breasts are shockingly hard and really lumpy, but I hear they take time to settle. Will most likely have fat grafting in the future. Hope all my May surgery sisters are doing well! XO",

For those getting radiation , I found the process to be relatively easy and painless. I used Miaderm cream twice a day. You can find it on Amazon. My skin looked like it had a bad sunburn but never blistered and healed perfectly. I just had BMX on May 17th due to recurrence, with direct implants during mastectomy. My radiated skin looks perfect so far. I give credit to the Miaderm. The section under my arm where they took out nodes in 2014 has always been tender, not bad... but three years later I can still feel it. The pain gets better gals, hang in there. XO",

I finally insisted they surgically remove it a year later. Turns out it was a cancer reccurence. I just had a double mastectomy May, because I realized the tests couldn't recognize my cancer.
