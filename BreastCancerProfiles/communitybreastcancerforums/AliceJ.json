    "Content": "Sep 22, 2008 02:27AM - edited Sep 22, 2008 02:29AM by AliceJ Yes, mine is painful too as you describe.  Mine is also not on the arm itself but on the BACK behind the arm.   Doesn't hurt much to touch but feels like a bad cut if I try to lie on it.  Simply can't.  In the daytime it just feels like a sunburn but is worse if I bend down to reach something. Just had lumpectomy, (2 breast lumps - 1/2 inch and 1 inch).  No radiation or chemo yet.  Haven't had it checked yet but will.  Over a month has passed and can't use massager to help it because sensitivity is too great. Need to return to work in a few days but really fear that constant heavy lifting all day long will worsen it tremendously.  It's very scary!  There are so many things to worry about aren't there  -- literally one thing after another in every aspect imaginable.  Not sure which torture is most, the physical or mental.   It didn't go to the lymph nodes but I still wonder many times, if the whole thing wouldn't have been best left alone.",
