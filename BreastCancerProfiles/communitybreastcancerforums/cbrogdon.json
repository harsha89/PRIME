I pray this therapy knocks the liver mets out for you. Penny - I am so happy to hear your biosphere procedure is finished and pray your next scans will be clear. Insurance question - I am still fighting my insurance company who only wants to cover chemo/radiation/surgery. How does one even go about fighting the insurance company for coverage for other effective treatment/procedures? Prayers to you all.",

I read several of you experience muscle cramping and I just wanted to state that for me taking extra magnesium (400mg) daily has made the difference of tolerating femara or stopping femara. I know it is different for different people and for different treatments being taken, I am just throwing it out there. God bless all of us!",

I guess I am struggling with the news of being told I am now stage IV, and the fact that I have to wait for the next CT scan to know for sure if the femara is even working (very scary to me)...  thank you all for this threaded discussion as it may be my new bestie....",

I have liver mets and had chest wall mets until three weeks ago when these were surgically removed. I am not a surgical candidate on the liver due to the tumors being too close to the diaphragm. I thought I read on this forum a while ago about some of you having cryoablation on their liver tumors. I spoke with my medical oncologist about it and found an interventional radiologist at Barnes that does this procedure. The problem is my insurance won't cover it. Does anyone out there have and suggestions? Incidently, my insurance originally approved the procedure and I was admitted to Barnes and was told right before the procedure that the insurance company made a mistake and the procedure was not covered. Does anyone out there have any comments or suggestions about that as well? Prayers for all of us...",

Being turned down by the insurance company after I was approved was probably one of the worst days in my life as I honestly felt that they were playing \"God\" with my life. It frankly scared the hell out me to think I may not be able to get that type of treatment. The Dr.s office appealed the decision, per the insurance company protocol, and then I guess I may need to get a lawyer involved. I hope you are feeling OK today and got out for a little while. Anything we can do to make ourselves feel better, even for a moment, is what we must do. Freebird, that includes you and all of us letting our feelings out if it makes us feel better. Pleasant dreams and restful sleep everyone. ",
