I never would have thought I would have gotten so much immediate support and comfort from strangers. A few things I didn't mention earlier was that I have a swollen lymph node in my armpit that appeared when I noticed the lump, so I am concerned it may be associated. When do I find out from the doctors if it is associated? Also, they never gave me a stage, just a high grade 3. Should I know the stage now? Or are they awaiting the other tests results they are running. Also, they took 11 biopsies and although there are a ton of calcifications none of their samples contained the calcium. The biopsies came back positive in 4 different areas of the lump with just the tissue, does that mean it is starting to spread if it's already in the tissue? My lump has doubled in size in the last 4 weeks, it's now the length and width of a twinkie. My aunt on my father's side just went through this twice and the first time they removed both breasts. BC runs in both sides of my family. Itjustme10: Unfortunately I found out on a Friday afternoon so I wasn't able to contact my doctors at home. I am currently going to school in Hawaii, I'm from California and would like to go there for surgeries and treatments, but am looking for a doctor somewhere on the mainland. I do love my plastic surgeon and he has been informed through this whole process, but I'm awaiting a phone call probably tomorrow to hear his opinion.  Please be honest with me, I am trying to prepare for the worst. I have already decided to remove both breasts so hopefully I won't have to worry about this again later. My family is still in the denial stage and has been since this all started which is not helping me at all. Also if you have any suggestions of amazing doctors, I will take any suggestions.  Thank you everyone for posting to my initial post. This is an amazing resource. Thank you all so much, it means the world to me!",

I finally found a doctor that took my abnormal huge lump seriously. I had implants put in in May and all the docs kept saying the lump was scar tissue from the surgery. Now that it's official I'm not sure what the next step is. I don't see a doctor for another 5 days! I'm trying to keep my familty at ease as well as my mind. Anyone have words of adivise? I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. Samantha Log in to post a reply",
