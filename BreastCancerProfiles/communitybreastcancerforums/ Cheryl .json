Married to an awesome guy (Jim) we have 2 sons 20 & 15. This whirlwind started Aug. 6th when I found a lump in my right breast. I woke my husband in a panic, breast cancer run's heavy in my family. The next day (Thursday) I called my Dr. and they set up a mammogram & ultrasound, results came in Friday at 5:00, looked suspicious meet with surgeon on Monday, she gave me a choice needle biopsy or removed it. I had it removed on Aug. 12th. On Aug. 19 the results came in, yes i had breast cancer. Thought for that moment it was the end of my world, would I see my kids grow up, would I see my grand kids, wow it was crazy. We came home I got myself together, Jim calmed me and we talked, we talked about a 2nd opinion. Called the Dr. the next day and told them I wanted a 2nd opinion and asked them to set me up with an appointment at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. This was a 400 mile & 7 hour drive from our home, and let me tell you it was worth every mile. I had to wait 2 week to get in and yes that was the longest 2 weeks ever. My appointments started on Sept. 4th, after days of testing and getting the results the same day. I was stage II 2.5 cm. after confirming everything, I decided I wanted a double/bilateral mastectomy with reconstructive surgery. My surgery took place on Sept. 10, 2008 at Mayo. At the last minute I changed my mind on the reconstructive, I wasn't sure so I didn't do it. I just wanted to get the cancer out first, then maybe later I'll have the other's done. The Dr.'s were all very understanding and told me it was all my choice and my desicion. I started my Chemo on Oct. 9th,2008 at Portage Hospital in Hancock Michigan.  I go for my 2nd treatment tomorrow Oct. 23rd.  It was the longest 2 months of my life, yes I was very scared. My  emotions are working overtime, I seem to cry every night between 11:00 & midnight. My 15 yr old in sleeping by then, hubby works midnight and my oldest is living in Houston, TX. I guess at that time of night I just miss all of them. Now as far as the hair falling out, yep scared of that too. I have my wig, hats & scarfs, but the fact is,I'm still scared.  I have a total of 8 treatments also. Bottom line is I'm here and very thankful for that, the support of family and friends is over wheming. You do truly learn just who your real friends are. I'm sorry this is so long, I just needed to get it all off my chest. Remember, \"Life is Good as long as your here to enjoy it\" so make the best of each day! I would love to hear from any of you wonderful ladies",

Through the whole first week I was so tired and slept alot. The second week was much better and today I feel great!!! LOL that's cause tomorrow I go for my 2nd treatment and we get to start it all over again, I see it as sending little \"PacMan's\" through my body to chomp out the cancer!!! GOOD LUCK AND YOU STAY STRONG! ",

I'll be getting my  7th Chemo tomorrow #3 Taxol. The first 4 treatments were A/C, my 1st Taxol was pure hell, the 2nd one my Dr. didn't send me for the Nuelasta shot and it went better. I still had the muscle & bone pain , but it was less intense. So I think my 8th & final treatment will be around Jan. 19-22. Does anyone eat sweets like crazy before a treatment? Man, I'm just eating everything in site. My family Dr. gets my blood draw reports and is concerned about my sugar being a bit high, but my oncology Dr. never says a word about it, and I even asked her once.......  Hope I need not be concerned....... I'm sorry I didn't pop in to wish you all Happy Holidays & Happy New Year. I do hope for nothing but good health to all of you and me. Are any of you from the Upper Peninsula that might like to get together for lunch and a good visit? If so, let me know. Ok girls, chin up, smile, make someone else smile each day, hug your family, be thankful for your family & friends support.",
