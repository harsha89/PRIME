      "Content": "Aligal wrote: Hi! English is not my native language so please ignore my bad grammar. I'm 29 years old and last year I noticed a dimpling on my right breast. I went to my doctor and did an ultrasound. All came clear and I just forgot about it. Last Saturday I was in front of the mirror and noticed the dimpling again. Except that this time I also noticed a new dimpling on the same breast near to the first one. I did some research and I found this amazing website. I'm freaking out right now because I read that dimpling it's almost always a sign of BC. I have a doctor's appointment next Wednesday and this \"not knowing\" thing is killing me. I'm having trouble sleeping and can't stop crying. All I can think about it's that I'm going to die. My husband doesn't want to hear about my fears. I guees he is trying to think positive. But I know something bad is on my way for all I read here. I feel so alone right now. Log in to post a reply",

Do you mind answering two more questions? - Is the contrast necessary? I'm scared about it. I've been avoiding an exam in my head because of it. - Dimpling always means cancer? There are benign reasons that could causing these? Did you ever come across with a case where the dimpling was something else? -------------------------- Alicky, welcome aboard! I hope the dimpling means nothing to you. Comeback to tell us what your doctor said.",

I read a lot of topics here where woman with BC, and dimpling as the only symptom, did mammogram and ultrasound and the tests came all clear. Only the biopsy showed something were wrong. That's my concern. All I know is that my breast looks different. Wreen - I do have problems with anxiety. I'm getting recovered from a panic disorder. It's a long process but I'm better now. I hope this is my anxiety talking! Thanks for your recommendation. Djmammo - The dimpling looks like a cellulite. I wouldn't be so worried if the other breast (larger than this one) had the same thing and if I wasn't so skinny. My bra size it's an A cup so it's very easy to see any changes. The dimpling it's located on 6 clock position. I did all the steps. Step 2 the dimpling stays the same. Step 3 (bend forward) I can't see it because of it's location. And step 4 the dimpling stills visible but not so deep. What is the meaning of it?",

I went to the doctor and he laughed about my concerns because in his conceptions I'm to young to have BC and have no family history. I don't need to say how much disappointed I was because he didn't even performed a good examination. He kept laughing and making jokes. At one point he asked how I came up with this idea of cancer because dimpling is always associated with lumps. I know this is not true. I read a lot of topics here that says otherwise. Anyway, he ordered a MRI so I can be less concerned - that's what he said - and told me that he'll be very surprised if the result shows something. Is this the correct procedure? I read that MRI got a lot of false positive results.",
