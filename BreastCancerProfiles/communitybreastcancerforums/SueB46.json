You know, mottled color, dull, sticking up here and there, matted down everywhere else. Can a sylist do something with this? I definitely need a coloring, but don't know if a trim will help. Maybe I just have to wait for it to get a little longer. And what's with my eyebrows!? My eyelashes are all there, I'm shaving my legs again, but my eyebrows don't want to make the effort. I'd say they got to about half the hair necessary for full eyebrows, then stopped - so I still have to fill in with pencil. I'm wondering if they'll ever come back. Sue Log in to post a reply",

The treatment before, it took me the entire three weeks to recover and still wasn't close to 100% for the last one. Now I have surgery scheduled for 11/19. I was really hoping to get some recovery time in between, maybe 8 weeks. Both the scheduling nurse and my husband pushed me to take the first available date. I'm so worried about this. I'll be asking my med. onc. about it, but wondered what you all thought. Sue Log in to post a reply",

As for Taxotere...besides the usual stuff you describe, I also developed very burning, aching leg muscles which are so cramped up when I get up in the a.m. it takes me a while to walk properly. I also have edema in my feet and ankles. I have an oncologist who doesn't seem to have any answers. Maybe it comes from the Neulasta. Apparently this reaction isn't common, so I'm sure you'll get through just fine. Most people have fewer side effects from Taxotere than from A/C. Best wishes. Sue",
