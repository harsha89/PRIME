It was so wonderful to see him and it made my month!  I had 4 fields done and it went without a hitch.  It is a bit isolating in that room all by myself with the huge steely machine harnessing the power of the atom and it pointed at me.  I visualized the rays killing the cancer and tried not to think of what it was doing to the other cells.  This being the way I've accepted to keep my life.  When I got home I slathered the irradiated area with Aquafor and then went back to work.  ",

My RO says that it's most likely from a part of my liver being clipped by the radiation.  He wants me to take compazine an hour before treatment.  He says that the liver is so regenerative that there will be no damage to it from the rads.  I find that the nausea is quite often coupled with tiredness and it hits me like a 2 X 4.  I had the nausea bad yesterday so I had to go home from work and just lay down for a couple of hours.  Then it passed and I was able to go for a 3 mile walk with my husband and then go out to dinner.  The nausea hits fast but it also leaves as quickly as appears.",
