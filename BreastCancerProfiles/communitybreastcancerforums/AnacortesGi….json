My sister, Sue, died from breast cancer at 52 (2005).  Everyone (excpet my Mom) in my mother's family has died from cancers.  Sue was offered the test but she opted not to have it done.  One of her concerns was if it would affect her daughter's ability to get medical insurance. During that time my GP asked me if I wanted to get tested but since I didn't have BC I figured why bother.  Just keep going and getting the mammos. If Sue or myself had been tested (I'm sure she would have been positive) than I'm sure they would have sent me off to have an MRI well before the cancer I have reached stage 3.  It's the one regret that I have. Now that I'm dx'ed, my mother (who has had stage 1 twice) and I said we had enough.  We had to know for the rest of the family.  We both tested positive BRCA 2.  We've shared this with the immediate family and with the cousins.  It felt like a relief for us.  We knew there was a reason for all the cancer and to be able to blame this mutation feels good. My 30 year old daughter will be going in to be tested in the next week or so --  she's already met with the counselor.  She's still thinking through what she wants to do if she positive.  But she's already in a high risk category anway so the gene doesn't make a huge difference.  She's leaning toward the idea of doing vigilant screening till at least 40.  Then see what the medical world has to offer for options at that time. ",

I know you referenced the ACS website in another post.  If you are looking at their survival stats they show stage IIIc somewhere around a 50% chance of no mets in the first 5 years.  Well the oncs that I have talked to and the more recent studies put our chances of mets around 75% for the first 5 years.  Odds for us have gotten much better!

I don't think it is uncommon for oncs, if they track tumor markers at all because some don't use them, to follow a couple markers. My onc uses CA 27.29 and CEA. The TM that your onc chooses is not related to ER+ or ER-. Lobular (which I have) has a higher risk of going to other places than bone, liver, lungs and brain. A couple of years ago I found a study that showed the percentages for where lobular goes but I don't think I saved the link. If I'm remembering correctly, the next most likely place was the peritoneum, ovaries, fallopian areas. Or that could be my BRCA + mutation talking -- I'm not sure. Anyway, it could be that your onc is finding a better correlation between your how your bones mets are doing with the CA 15,3 marker. Or he is just watching it in case there is a spike and indicates the mets may have moved to a different area. As for dropping the CA 27.29, it could be that it doesn't correlate with your bone mets and he doesn't find it useful. If the tumor markers move around a lot then the trend line would be a big zig zag yet your scans show that your bone mets are stable. That would be an example of the TM not correlating to your mets. This is not unusual. That is why some docs don't even use TMs. Ever. But the best thing would be to ask your onc about your tumor markers. I'm doing a lot of supposition but I'm sure your onc has a good reason for which markers he is following. Make a commitment to ask him at your next visit and don't let him leave the room until he has explained it so that you understand his logic.",

You already have some positives.  They know what the cancer is -- that means they know how to fight it.  They found the lymph nodes -- they took them out so there is no wondering if something is still lurking in those nodes.  Grade 3 is aggressive but the great thing about that is it's also more receptive to the chemo.  You got surgery first and the tumor is out. That last comment might seem obvious but it really is meaningful.  I don't often mention this but I had some indicators that have caused the onc to feel I need the chemo first.  That they couldn't wait until I had surgery and had healed.  But I've had 12 weeks of chemo so far and now, everyday, that dark cloud keeping getting a little smaller.  It's not straight over my head any more.  And it's a reminder that other women have done this and that I will continue.  Every year the treatments and drugs have improved.  We're going to blow away those old stats and when they tally us it's going to look pretty darn positive. Keeping talking.  Some of those fears and concerns are valid; others are just our emotions talking.  But as you get those out of the way you'll find your strength and you'll find that you can do this. ",

But we do have control over mentally battling the fear.  I believe this.  But this is where I fall short because I'm not really sure how to do it.  Right now I'm in control of the fear because I'm actively in tx and my goals are short term.  Making it through the week and on to the next week of chemo.  Countdown. But when the chemo's done I want to continue to battle that fear.  Will I be able to just search into my soul and figure out how to ignore the unknown so I can concentrate on living my life for me and my family?  I sure hope so.  But if that doesn't work then maybe I'll need to look at alternatives.  Counseling.  Support groups.  A mentor who I can call.  I'm not sure. It's a good question.  Lots of ladies have managed it and it sounds like they had to search for their solutions, also.  We'll figure it out.  Just hope it's sooner rather than later.",

The caregiver side is a real hot button for me. I wrote a lengthy post (OK - most of my posts are much too long, it's a problem I have) responding to a daughter who hit that button. Instead of accepting her mother's situation and respecting her decisions, she implied she wanted to \"steer\" her into a more aggressive treatment plan. Well this is a very sensitive subject in my family because we learned that we had to accept and respect my sister's decisions and her quick demise. It was hard on each of us personally and affected the family dynamics. Definitely this post belonged in the caregivers forum and not here. But I'm sure the poster was looking for people who would support her viewpoint. I should have ignored it. Or at the most, should have just referred her to that forum. Or, now that I'm aware of the option, PM the mods so they can deal with it. I just got to quit letting those buttons get pushed because it really does bring up bad thoughts and feeling. The worst of which is that I will follow my sisters footsteps and not have much of a future. It's my biggest fear. My SIL asked if she could get an account and read these posts. I love my SIL -- she has been wonderful through all this. But I asked her not to join the boards because I knew she could recognize who I was (wish now I had picked a different username) and this is my sanctuary where I can say anything. I know that may be overreacting but I really need a place to go where my fellow stage IV'ers understand and I don't have to explain myself. So I guess I'm coming to the conclusion that when we ask the question, \"Who is this forum for?\", I think it really is for the stage IV women (or men). All others can read it, but ask your questions in the other forums.",

One of them is the visit with the onc when he told me that the scans had found bone mets. He said \"make no mistake about this, this now means that you are stage IV\". I prefer calling it stage IV regardless of when it was found. I don't plan on prescribing any treatment so I don't see the need for the technical reasoning. But I have no problem with those ladies who prefer using the technical label. As for the comments about limiting the posting to only stage IV. I don't think there is a right answer for me. When I belonged to the stage III forum I opposed the idea that only stage III ladies should post there. Although it irritated me if a lesser stage poster tried to get involved in a treatment related thread. Luckily that didn't happen too often. But stage IV is different. In the past 8 months I have already seen detrimental effects from family members. But I have also seen some who are very respectful and appear to get true benefits from being able to participate. However, once you step over the line from \"may die from breast cancer\" to \"will die from breast cancer\" then the discussions change. But I could probably be talked into the other viewpoint. It's a tough call.",

Lisa1962 and CinD both have good advice.  As weird as it may sound, getting back the news that you have cancer is better than not knowing.  Once you know, you feel like you can move on with your life.  I had to wait a month from initial mammo to path report.  With a strong family history (mom & sis) that waiting period could have put me in the loony bin.  But the way I looked at it, cancer was not a confirmed diagnosis and I was not going to let it rule my life until proven otherwise.  Yep, I was worried, but went on the things that Lisa1962 suggested and I kept control of my life. You'll get through this - it's hard, but keep your faith! mikie513 & kittygriffin - I'm so sorry for your diagnosis.  I'm glad to see you discovered the forums and are getting support from all the great ladies.  This place has been great for me.  The information overload and waiting that comes with the initial diagnosis is so overwhelming! As hard as it is, please keep waiting until the surgery, path reports and any scan results come back before trying to find out more.  There are different types of breast cancers and many, many different situations.  You need to understand your own presentation so you understand what you don't have. Based on what you've posted here it appears to me that you ladies have been doing the right thing and caught this very early.  Treatment is so much easier and the prognosis is excellent.  Wishing both of you the very best.",

To find out what you are facing I would really recommend that you talk directly to her oncologist.  Your post indicates that there have been problems with other chemos.  I'm not sure what you mean about the blood poisoning.  Is this the reduction of white and red blood cells?  If it is, did they try Neulasta or Neupogen to boost white cells?  For red blood cells they can do tranfusions or Procrit.  But maybe this something entirely different. Xeloda is not the normal chemo drug for stage III ladies.  So I think it would be the right call to ask the onc directly what is going on.  If you have a close relative in the medical profession it could be beneficial to bring them to the appt also -- sometimes the medical jargon can get confusing.

I mentioned in my other post that I had a trial onc and my regular onc.  I noticed a distinct difference between the two when it came to aggressiveness.  The trial onc seemed to want to go full tilt on treatment but she never talked about how it would impact my quality of life.  My regular onc seemed much more concerned that we didn't want to win the cancer battle just to have me loose my quality of life.  This may not be a concern for you but I had a long chemo treatment and didn't do especially well.  It was weekly, was suppose to be 27 infusions (I made it to 26), and I had to have 7 transfusions because of the effect it was having on my RBCs.  So my regular onc was pretty concerned about more chemo.  He did change his mind, though, after I was feeling better and he felt I could handle it.  I don't know anything Gemcitabine.  And as I mentioned in my other post the carbo that I had was low dose.  It was supposed to be 3 weeks, off a week, for 4 cycles.  Other than tanking my blood counts I really didn't have any SEs.",

It is normal for our bones to continuously build new bone cells and dissolve the old ones. Lytic mets weaken the bone -- the osteoclasts bone cells have been activated and these are the cells that dissolve bone. Blastic mets are a buildup of bone -- the osteoblastic cells are being motivated to continuously build new bone. Bone scans see blastic mets. CTs see lytic mets. In my case I have both and my onc told me that this is why he orders both of these scans. I also ran across a study that claimed PET/CT was slightly better than the combination of a bone scan and a CT. The PET part of the scan will see high glucose activity where there are cancer cells regardless of the lesion being lytic or blastic. Personally, I'm not fond of the PET just because I have had quite a few and ran into false-positives. Based on some of the posts by other it also seems like there are good reasons to use other tests such as MRIs since they can also reveal things like arthritis. Don't know that any one test is the \"right\" one. But just wanted to let you know that there are different types and not all tests show both types.",

I'm thinking it would be beneficial to get another opinion from an onc who specializes/researches the BRCA cancers. I'm sure that is why the Mayo onc wants to keep you on carbo - because of the effectiveness that has been seen with the platinum chemos against the BRCA cancers. But I don't have a good knowledge about carbo and the potential effects on the kidneys. I also wonder if there would be some further testing done at MD Anderson to look at your cancer genome to determine if targeted therapies such as affinitor would be effective based on your mTor pathway inhibitors. When I hear kidney I also think of when I was on the trial with Sutent. Very similiar to Avastin and is used for renal cancers. It is an antiogenisis agent that is supposed to prevent the cancer from creating blood pathways. I guess what I'm saying is that a third onc consult with an onc who is really in tune with some of the leading edge tools to try and determine the therapy that would have the highest likelihood of success while minimizing risks. I've been thinking about you and was just about to send a PM when I saw your post. I'm sorry that you have been taken off the trial. I am finishing up my first month tomorrow (actually today since it's like 4:00 am) but I'm just seeing the nurse practitioner and not the onc. Otherwise I'd be asking her about ABT-888 and if she has seen adverse effects on the kidney and what direction she would take. It's a rough decision. Rads can do damage -- no doubt about that. So I would be very hesitant to take that route without hearing from another onc. I'm sending you hugs and thinking of you!",

I always wondered if I had gone through menopause naturally if I would have had any issues at all since my periods never gave me any problems (other than being out of feminine products at the wrong times!). Since I was BRCA2+ we felt an oomph was important. My surgeon gave me the option to also remove the uterus at the same time. She is a gynecology surgeon who specializes in hereditary cancers. She didn't have any preference so it was up to me. I chose not to remove the uterus because I had heard of too many women who had prolapse issues from removing the organ. It could be that these were the older type of hysterectomy surgeries that were more prone to organ prolapse -- I'm not really sure. There is a good website for learning more about hysterectomies and helping decide if that is the route you would like to take. It's called HysterSisters. All I know is that nothing changed between the chemopause and after the oomph. The only symptom was hot flashes. And the hot flashes get worse for me on certain meds such as Aromasin. Not quite as bad when I've been on Femara or Tamoxifen.",

Cancer cells grow faster than normal bone cells so although the glucose uptake is going to be there for healing bone cells, it is going to be less than the glucose uptake for cancerous cells. Having said that, this is one of the reasons that PET scans are prone to false-positives. Back when I was involved in a study of the usefulness of PET in following the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment it seemed that every PET would show something new that could indicate mets (I was stage III at the time). And each time the new finding would end up being nothing of concern. So there can be many reasons for an elevated uptake. But if the met has been followed with a PET/CT from the beginning I believe it is easier for the radiologist to discern between normal and abnormal. But I'm not a radiologist or a tech. So I could be all washed up in what I'm saying. It's just from my experience in being scanned and talking to my onc. I have not been NED since I was dx'ed with mets, only after I completed my stage III treatment.",

I'm going to the onc today and will either get my last chemo tx or we'll decide that I'm done.  I've been on neoadjuvant chemo to shrink the tumors and get rid of the diffused cancer cells in my breast so they'll get clear margins.  Surgery for me is April 26.  Chemo wasn't fun but with the supportive meds the side effects were manageable.  I'm 51.  My chemo was slightly different than yours.  I had the taxol first (along with a trial drug called Sutent) and then did weekly AC.  I kept working through the first 4 months but I listened to my body and my emotions, which were getting very tired, and went on short term disability at Christmas.  I'm feeling much stronger and it won't be long before I'm back to work until I take another leave for surgery.  It's going to take some time before you're OK with this diagnosis -- at least that has been the case for so many of us.  But you will get through it and be fine.",

But there is a big difference between my having to stop all treatments for 28 days than your situation where either a) the cancer is taking a break after being kicked around by all your treatments or b) your body has finally figured out how to handle the slimy stuff and it's keeping the cancer in check. Taking a break seems like a very reasonable option. I like Jill's thinking about the ineffective treatments and the need to give your body a break.",

My anxiety attack started when I felt like I could breathe - a 500 pound brick on my chest. Got out of the vehicle with my cell phone but couldn't dial because I couldn't focus and my hands were shaking too bad. Passerby called 911 and by the time the ambulance got there I was doing everything I could to keep my eyes open. Felt like if I closed them then they would be closed permanently if you know what I mean. Fingers and toes started going numb and that moved up into my arms and legs. By the time we got to the hospital I was having severe chest pains. They finally talked me down from it and got me breathing normal. DIdn't need any meds although when my DH and I were alone for a moment (after I was breathing OK again) I had him get an ativan out of my purse and took it. So that is what my panic attack was like. Steroids gave me a different type of agitation. Not too bad but I definitely remember the restless leg thing. I'm sorry that you have had to go through so much before you have even had a chance to get your bearings after being told that you are stage IV. Time will do wonders.

Had to edit this cause my chemo brain is working slow this morning.  I wanted to say that I'm pulling for a clear scan!",

The bone scan was standard for my onc.  It clearly outlines the bones and any mets (or arthritis!) \"lights up\" and is easy to see. In my trial I went on to have multiple PETs.  Different machine and different contrast material.  It was checking for glucose uptake - cancer cells are very active so they have high glucose activity.  This was used to monitor the effectiveness of the chemo trial.  I'm sure I wouldn't have had this test had I gone through standard AC-T.",

I had it easier than you.  My kids are adults and I have a wonderful DH to talk with and he gives me great support.  When I was in the midst of it all I would think about ladies like yourself.  I have a lot of respect for what you have done. I completely understand what your feelings and how hard it can be to relate to ladies with DCIS and stage 0.  I have, and continue to have, trouble understanding where they are coming from.  At one point I thought about posting but I just didn't have the courage so I'm glad you did.  The anchor that keeps weighing me down is that my sister died back in 2005 at 52 -- she was initial dx'ed with stage IIIa ILC.  She was never tested but I'm sure she was also BRCA 2+ since both my mom and I tested positive. You would think that I would be more understanding since my mom was dx'ed a month before me at stage I.  And this was her second bout.  We couldn't get her records from her first dx 30 years ago but it was probably stage 0 then based on what she can remember.  Since she lost a daugher she has a lot of guilt about her early stage dx. So what's wrong with me that I can't be more compassionate and understanding?  In my heart I know that if I  had been dx'ed with stage 0 or I instead of III I still would have been a basket case.  I would have been so scared that the docs weren't doing enough.  That I would end up going down the same road as my sister because of the lack of preventative measures.  So you would think that I could be more accepting of their concerns and fears. But it just isn't where I'm at right now.  I keep hoping that we will get a cancer support group in town so I can spend more time around other people with different stages and even different cancers.  I know I could use the therapy time talking and listening.  In the meantime I stay away from those forums because I know that I am not the right person to be trying to support those ladies.  So my way of dealing with it, for now, has been to stay away.  But this is one of the reasons that I plan on getting more involved with cancer related charities in town once my own life is back on track. Thank you for having the courage to post and give me a place to air my feelings!",

Go ahead and cry.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  We do what we have to do.  For some of us, that means looking in the void and see nothing but negative.  But when we pull back, we see all the wonderful things in our life and we find the courage to go on.  You're in the middle of chemo and you've been let down because you thought things would get better with Taxol.  I can understand that because I heard that was the \"easy\" one.  Well it wasn't easy for me. I had neuropathy, terrible \"fogs\", everything tasted terrible (that when you realize how many food commercial are on tv!), rash, hoarse voice and had two transfusion.  I actually did Taxol first and then AC.  AC was better just because my taste improved but I still had to have 5 more transfusions.  Chemo is rough.  My goal was to get through the week.  But when it got really bad my goal was to get through the day.  I did it.  So can you!  It will get better.  But unfortunately, it requires time. I also wanted to respond to your comments about cancer treatments.  We are much, much further than 20 years ago.  We're further than we were back in '99 when my sister was dx'ed.  The supportive drugs are greatly improved and allow more women to continue with chemo.  In the past, they would have to stop because of nausea or low counts.  A friend of mine had luekemia 20 years ago.  She had to be hospitalized the entire time she was going through chemo (6 months!).  Now we have AIs for estrogen positive.  For those of us with BRCA2+ they have Parp Inhibitors.  I have a list from someone who used to post -- I'll try to find it and add it to this post. Don't believe the conspiracy people!  Their simplistic view really burns me.  Breast cancer affects many, many people.  Including (or the families of) pharmaceutical execs, researchers, oncologist, etc.  But cancer is a mutation of a cell, the very basic form of life, not easily separated from the good cells.  If you would like to understand the struggle of finding a cure for cancer I would recommend \"The Emperor of all Maladies: a history of cancer\".  I found it very interesting. Keep on, Posy!  You're getting close to the end of treatment.  Right now, time is your friend.",

Self message is easy to do - just like Jenn described.  Just a light touch is all it takes to get things moving.  But going to a PT that specializes in lymphedema is a really good idea because not only can they show you the correct way to massage (starting with the trunk and moving to the arm), they can also give you a series of exercises that increase the lymphatic flow.  They can find the \"plugs\" and clear them so the fluids will start moving again.  By the time you're done you'lll know how to take care of it yourself.",

I thought the person that I was talking to would keep my story confidential because she had her confidentiality broken just a month ago.  A fellow club member recognized her voice as she and her doctor talked about her cancer biopsy in the outpatient surgery room.  That club member proceeded to let everyone else in the organization know about her cancer.  My friend was extremely upset as she had planned on keeping her medical issues private.  She told me today that she had repeated my \"walkabout\" story to her many friends that work at the hospital and that they were appalled that the hospital had \"lost\" me.  I don't like drama.  I did not want her repeating to others what I had told her.  I was venting at the time and I had thought she would empathize with how I was loudly reprimanded, with first and last names being used, just like her privacy had been violated. She will remain my friend but the filters are back on -- full strength.   I do appreciate the feedback and the empathy from all of you.  This has just been a very confusing episode and I truly hope it is never repeated.  Should I end up in the hospital again and start having issues then I think I will contact the advocate to see if we can understand why there is this lack of good communication.  Or maybe I will just go to Seattle.  But I am not going to dwell on this any longer.  ",

As you found out, not all insurance plans will pay for that 3rd test. For instance, medicare was not going to pay for my mom's testing but my plan would have paid for it. We didn't need the 3rd test - our mutation was found on the second test. The majority of the mutations are found with the \"basic\" testing. Since you had that much done, I think it's safe to say that you are negative. You should have been given a report from Myriad Labs that provides the results. The results are something like no mutation, a variant, or mutation. My testing was back in Nov of 2010 so I don't remember a lot of the specifics. If you were positive, although it sounds like you are not, it could potentially affect your chemo. For instance there are some studies that indicate the platinum chemos work well with BRCA cancers. So your onc might use cisplatin or carobplatin. Depends on what the onc is comfortable with and what each ladies' situation calls for. If you don't have any paperwork from Myriad Labs then you might want to call your onc's office and ask for a copy of that report. They are the only lab that does the BRCA testing in the US. (Just don't get me started on Myriad labs and why they are the only lab in the US and how they managed to patent the BRCA gene. I'm looking forward to the day when the lawsuit is finally heard by the Supreme Court.)",

I have become a believer in anti-depressant.  Tried Lexapro and Wellbrutin.  The onc and I settled on Paxil and it has really helped carry me through this.  Some day I'll stop taking it but for now that thought is still too scary.  Being normal is still too new -- I need more time.",

The hang-up (apologizing again) was that Skagit insisted on a pregnancy test before they would scan me. After I finally stopped laughing, I asked her if they would possibly accept that I was not pregnant because I had a BSO. She apologized (again! she is really nice and thoughtful) that she wasn't familiar with all the medical abbreviations so I explained that it was a bilateral oophectomy. She called them again and it worked. Little did she know that I would gladly do a pregnancy test if it gets me scan results sooner. Whatever it takes to grease the wheels!",

It brings together a large group of people who have this huge common thread of cancer. But there are also a lot of people who haven't dealt directly with it. They may have family members or friends who have been stricken but they weren't close enough to see what it looks like. Then there are the people who have tremendous stories of what they have faced and the courage that they live with. Last year's speaker was the town's school superintendent who had been dx'ed with prostrate cancer. He was an example of someone who went through the \"I'm going to die from this\" to the cured endpoint after surgery. So how could his story be interesting? Well, his dx immediately hit the paper so everyone knew about it. He was in shock mode before it was understood how much cancer he had or if it had spread yet he already had people looking at him with those pity eyes. But it was also the school year that, after his dx, we lost a first grader to leukemia. Needless to say that hit him hard now that he had a personal taste of cancer. So his talk was short on his cancer but focused on the community and how it rallied around him but even more important, around the lovely girl to make her short live as full as possible. Ended with how his cancer was a minor thing because of the research and learning how to cure his prostrate cancer. How research continues to give hope for these young kids and someday they will be cured and get to finish their schooling and have a full life. So that is an example of how you don't have to have the worst cancer story at the relay. It is about how cancer does make us cry - it hurts. It is about how this have improved, that the support and the research are making a huge difference. That we are seeing the difference right now - it's not this goal that is so far out in the future that no one is benefitting and may never benefit from it. We, as stage IV ladies, are seeing the changes right now with longer lives. But it is not enough. We need the research that is going to give us a cure for all the cancer types and stages. Does that help? We can PM if you would like to talk more. I would also suggest that you be put into contact with the ACS staff person who works with the Relay Committee. That person should be able to give you all sort of assistance (if they are worth their salt!). What I personally like about ACS is that they try to keep their staff numbers low, their advertising low and put most of their money back into support programs and research. There is lots of information on the ACS website and they are open about how the money gets dispersed.",

The pain that you described - starting at the hip and going down into the thigh and feels like a tooth being drilled - sounds like some sort of nerve compression. When the nerves get pressed the pain is sharp and very, very painful. It can make your leg get weak all of a sudden and can cause falls. Definitely needs to be looked at.

I'm 51 also.  My old hair was gray -- I actually liked it because it had a real nice silvery frosted look to it.  My first thought was to match it but I couldn't see anything in the catalogs or online that appeared to be the same color.  That's when I decided I had to go to a wig shop and see the real deal.  I just couldn't count on those online color swatches.  I also knew that I didn't want the human hair because I just didn't want to deal with the care and styling.  I've ended up with 4 wigs for now.  One from TLC (free, through a local hairdresser), one from the Looks Good, Feel Good class and two that I bought.  I really need to take the 2 free one (one red, one brunette) to my hairdresser and get them trimmed up so fit my face better; they are both too straight and need some more 'zip\".  But the other two I bought.  They are synthetic and cost about $125.  One is blonde and the other a bruntte with frosted streaks. I had decided that since I was going to lose my hair I was going to try to have some fun with it.  I was always very conservative with hair before but I considered chemo as my excuse to get as crazy as I wanted to.  Still can't say I'm crazy (no pink or oranges for me, thanks!) but having me wearing red hair is a pretty big stretch from where I used to be. All the people I work with know what I'm going through.  And so they get a kick out of it not knowing what color I'm going to be the next day.  And the two wigs I bought -- I can't believe how many comments I've gotten from others who have no idea that it's a wig and I'm going through chemo.  They just figure I've had my own hair worked over.  It's been a morale booster. I was very happy with the wig shop I went to.  She pulled some for me and then I told her a few I wanted to try.  I'm so glad I didn't try to do this out of a catalog.  And there's a chance I might go back and get another one.  It is so cool getting curls without a perm!",

Since Aetna had paid me some LTD during that time I had to use part of that to reimburse Aetna. Since I would have had to reimburse Aetna whether I'd filed on my own or through Allsup, their services truly were free. But had I filed on my own I doubt I would have been as agressive in trying to demonstrate my disability that long ago. However I know another lady who is also on LTD and she had to pay her entire lumpsum back to Aetna. That is usually the case since most people go on LTD fulltime and don't continue to try and work like I did. Had I used Allsup on my own I believe their cost is 30% of your lumpsum. That's a pretty significant fee. I wouldn't recomend using a third party unless your work history and disability history is complicated. Whoever you used, I hope they did a good job for you and got you an aggressive disability date.",

Unfortunately my employer changed the accelerated clause to say that life expectancy has to be less than 6 months. I'm not going to try for that money - luckily I have good LTD coverage which gets us through this. When you apply for SSDI you definitely want to demonstrate that she was disabled from the time all this started. But they will consider the pay received in that time period so it will reduce what you receive and if you get a check for SSDI backpay then 80% of it is taxable. Using vacation days for when you are ill are not regular pay so I was reimbursed through SSDI for the 5 weeks of vacation I used instead of sick days. I was working two days a week and using 3 days of vacation. Turns out this was below the threshold of the amount of hours Soc Security looks for to consider the pay as \"fulltime\" so they considered this as not working. It was complicated stuff so I have forgotten most of it. I was also lucky that my LTD insurance company paid the fee for Allsup to file for my SSDI. All I had to do was supply the timesheets and pay stubs. Normally their fee is 30% of what you get from SSDI in backpay. I would have done it on my own had it not been free for me.",

The BRCA 1 mutations tend to be triple negative (ER-/PR-/HER-) like yourself. While BRCA 2 tends to be ER+/PR+/HER-. Of course there are always exceptions. The mutation is passed by a parent; it is found in both males and females. It definitely affects the risk of breast cancer but also increases risks with ovarian and, in men, prostrate plus a few more cancers (very small risk increase). So the main reasons to be tested in a person who is already dx'ed with breast cancer is for treatment purposes. Because I was BRCA 2+ I had a double mast (right breast was completely clear) and had my ovaries/fallopian tubes removed. But if you are positive without cancer then you are in a high risk group for testing and may decide to remove breasts or ovaries as a preventative measure. They continue to research so there are trials out there that may be used as treatment for BRCA positive ladies. Insurance paid for my testing. Medicare paid for my Mom's testing. We had to see some genetic counselors first. They reviewed our family history and gave us a risk percentage that we might have the mutation. Some insurance companies use that risk number to decide if they will pay or not. It is expensive. Lots of information on this subject in BCO and FORCE.",

Then was dx'ed with mets to the liver last March. Not only am I still doing OK, I have hope that I have many years in front of me because there are so many treatment options that I have yet to try. Some of these ladies get on a treatment that keeps them going for years before they have to change treatments. You have every reason to have hope. Especially since you are close to MD Anderson and can get a good second opinion from them. Hopefully your normal onc has a better perspective. And I would tell him about the negative attitude that you got from this other onc. Docs need to know what other docs are like to the patients. The only way they can find out is by patients giving them feedback. Best of luck with your visit on Tuesday!",

Last October I had the laproscopic BSO (removed ovaries and fallopian tubes).  For that I went to a Gyn surgeon who specializes in hereditary cancers.  They did an extensive biopsy where they slice the tissue in to many thin specimens so they can look throughout the tissue for cancer.  And during surgery they do \"washings\" to look for cancer cells in the abdomen.  Everything was clear. No recon for me.  Don't want it.  I love putting on my forms in the morning and having perky breasts all day.  Totally comfortable!

I do not regret trying this treatment at all.  My only regret is that it didn't keep working for me.  The platelets never got too bad, but the cutoff to withhold treatment for this particular trial was 100,000.  Hopefully your trial protocol would be a little more reasonable at something like 75,000.  The worse my platelets got was 96,000 so I lost a week of taking the drug until the platelets got back over 100.  I only had to do labs every 30 days (except when we were watching my platelets).  Veliparib is relatively gentle on the blood counts.  When I was in the hospital after my gall bladder surgery my hemoglobin did get down in the sevens for some reason so I got a couple of units of red blood cells.  I'm not sure why that happened since it had been staying constant in the low elevens. The only really hard thing about the drug was that initial month of nausea while my body got used to the drug.  But taking Zofran, Compazine and Ativan got me through the 3 weeks that were the worst and then just Compazine and Ativan for the last couple of weeks. There have been some very good results for some ladies (both BRCA and trip neg) who have taken this drug.  My trial onc had at least one lady that was still on it after 20+ months.  She was one of her first patients to try veliparib.  This drug is definitely more tolerable than chemo.  It might give you a good break to build up some strength.  And there is a chance that you will have a good response.  If I were in your shoes I would definitely want to give it a try. As for me, I just got a carboplatin infusion this last week.  I talked my onc into trying the carbo first.  But after two cycles if it isn't doing anything than we are going to try cisplatin.  I'm pretty concerned about the chemo because when I was doing my stage III chemo I had to have 8 transfusions for my red blood cells.  I'm just afraid that I won't be able to tolerate the hits to my marrow.  Oh well, we'll see how it goes.  We've tried everything we could for the BRCA2+ except for some hard core platinum chemos.  So this is the last shot at a treatment that is really focused on my cancer.  After that it will just be the eeny-meeny-minnie-moe method for choosing chemos. Wishing you the best of luck and I hope you can do the veliparib! Christy",

So what are your percentages?  First off, they really can't be broken down to IIIb.  Stats are much broader than that.  They lump all stage III together.  And they also lump all the women together irrespective of treatment types (different chemo, different surgeries, different radiation).  They also lump together women who exercise, don't exercise, take their hormonal drugs daily, skip or stop their hormonal drugs, have weight issues, have no other health issues, have many other health issues, etc.  So to know your future who really have to look at YOU.  Calculators and studies just can't do that. I've looked at a lot of information trying to better refine my own stats.  I have to say, what Claire posted the other day, seems to me one of the most accurate stats we have as a stage III group. \"For those diagnosed between 1995-2004, it was 74.1%\" And that study group is from 7-16 years ago.  I'm sure that our survival rate has gone up since then.  And it still makes a big difference when you factor in your specific disease, health and attitude. Your tamoxifen makes a huge difference.  And when your done 4 years from now there will be more advances in research. ",

Two people were what I considered young and needed some coaching. In one of our weekly status meeting one of these people made the comment that I don't answer my emails anymore. It really hit me to core when she said it. One of the items that I wanted to work on with her improve how she did her troubleshooting before she shot out emails. She send one out and before you had a chance to hit Send on your reply she had sent the \"never mind\" email. But the truth was that I was just ignoring her emails and not working with her. That's when I realized that I was giving my team the leadership and support that they needed. Time to go out on full-time LTD. Four months later I come back and my manager and I were of the same mind. Stay away from the team lead role and just work on two projects that was individual work and utilized my 25 years of knowledge. Just 3 days a week. Tried this for 5 months. The last month I was only working half days because of the fatigue and headaches. I knew it was time to go. And I realized that it was the right thing to do for my company and for some individual who was going to get a good paying job with a future. Time for someone else to have the wonderful opportunities that I had.",

Occasionally I go back to search for information or remember who posted something (chemobrain thanks the search functionality!). I was just in the process of doing that and finally decided I had to say something about the women who are no longer posting. I come back to the first page and here is this thread! Is it me or have things changed? Quite honestly, when Coolbreeze posted, I was so glad to see many ladies show up that hadn't posted in a while. Since then, it seems like even more ladies have gone silent. It also seems like there isn't much attempt at humor anymore. I realize there have been times when feelings get inadvertently hurt, but in my time on the boards I have never seen this done with malicious intent (at least in the initial posts) on either the Stage III or Stage IV threads. Yes, I have seen it on other forums in the past but I don't go there because of the nastiness. If this change is because of hurt feelings then I think it's time to pull up the big girl panties and move on. I know that I was very hurt about 3 month after I started posting. I was given a very flippant answer to something that was very emotionally important to me. I was extremely upset for a week. But I finally realized that the poster did not mean to hurt and there was no sense in my continuing to feel sorry for myself. The best thing I ever did was to get back on the boards and move on. And I'm going to even name names so you can see how right I was to let it go. The poster was Apple. I never sent her a PM about it and I'm so glad that I didn't. As I got to know her better I realized that she never, ever meant to hurt me. I just took it wrong. She was a wonderful lady. So am I reading too much into the boards? Have things changed? Are there other reasons and I'm all washed up? What do you ladies think?",

But one day, at the end of my workday, I was talking to a co-worker and started to feel a little strange. I attributed it to the cold that I was trying to get over. Hopped into my pickup and proceeded to drive home. Kept feeling more out of it as I drove along. Started to have a hard time focusing. I only had a 12 minute drive home but 4-5 blocks away from the house I had to pull the truck to the curb because I felt like I was going to black out. I thought for sure that the reason I was having trouble breathing was because I was getting pneumonia. I was so disoriented that I couldn't call anyone on my phone. A father and son on a bike ride stopped and ended up calling 911 for me. I ended up in a full blown panic attack. Hands and feet going numb, fighting to stop from blacking out and finally terrible pains in my chest. They got me calmed down at the hospital and ran the usual scans. Turns out my sinuses were completely blocked. Between talking to my co-worker about my health (he has a wife with similar health issues) and the feeling that I was getting from my sinuses/head woosiness it was all I needed to set me up for a panic attack. After experiencing that I promised my onc that if I started feeling weird like that again I would take my Ativan and have my DH come and drive me home. I always have Ativan in my purse now and if I think I'm getting anxious then I take one. There is no way I want to go through that experience again. And I haven't got hooked on it yet, which used to be my biggest worry.",

I'm another one who found out the port placement is important for women who don't have much fat.  I eventually had to have my original port removed and a smaller one inserted.  The first surgeon didn't even tell me that there are different sizes so that was great relief to know I was getting a smaller one.  The second surgeon took time with me to figure out the best place and I still have it almost a year after my last chemo.  Doesn't bother me at all! I'm one of those that loves having a port.  I do not like IVs.  But don't be surprised if it hurts for the first week after it's been placed.  They told me that after it's inserted they can use it right away.  Well, in my case they were going to get their hand bit if they tried!  After a week it was fine.  EMLA is lidocaine in a cream.  Some infusion centers use lidocaine before they access the port (i.e. stick the needle in) and others don't.  The place where I go they give you a shot of lidocaine first -- it's a very small needle so they tell you it's a misquito bite.  But I've also used the cream.  You slather it on about an hour before and just cover it with plastic wrap so it doesn't get on your clothes.",

If you are going to be involved then it would be a good idea for your mother to make sure your name is on the HIPAA form which allows you to have access to her records. A second opinion is always, always a good idea.  Ideally, the second opinion just confirms the confidence that you've already bestowed in the first team of docs.  Sometimes it can be a completely different recommendation.  But the docs expect it and sometimes insurance companies will insist on it.  As nowords says - it's all about trusting the team and moving forward.  You don't want to look back with regrets.",

Kerosene is one of the products that is derived through the distillation of crude oil. As an IT analyst I worked at a refinery. We would bring in crude oil and use different methods to pull out gas, deisel, jet fuel from crude oil. After these products are pulled out of the crude, the remaining crude gets cut into other products that are less used. One of these is kerosene. I don't know where people come up with crazy ideas like this. It is sad that anyone would claim a toxic chemical can be injested as some sort of home remedy. Chickadee - I'm confused about your comment that the copper depletion is in a Phase II trial which makes it unavailable to patients. I'm a patient on a Phase I trial. Did you mean that you cannot get the treatment as a patient unless you are on the trial? It's early morning here and maybe I'm not reading that correctly.",

Right now I'm thinking these guys are trying to sound like they have the answers in an effort to drum up business or research funds. I have had discussions with my onc about this very thing - analyzing the cancer to determine the correct targeted therapy. We even sent a tissue sample to a lab in Texas where they mapped the genome. All we got from that was about a half dozen areas that have some treatment options and it was rated as poor, neutral or strong. For instance my tissue was looked at for having a mutation on the MTOR pathway and whether it was a poor or strong possibility for treatment or if it appeared to be normal (neutral). But it was not the specific mutation that these guys were talking about. However my onc did mention that there are some labs in California with the serious computing power to do a more comprehensive analysis. Maybe that is where these guys are from. But it all boils down to - can they deliver?",

You will get beyond the nightmare.  For me the worse part was my initial dx in July, waiting for all the scans and waiting for tx to start.  It was hell.  I had never been through so much stress in my life.  But as time moves on the results come back and you find out what you have and you can concentrate on that.  You find out what you don't have so you can let those fears go. I'm on week 20 of my neoajuvant chemo.  I only have 7 more weekly txs to go.  I'm 51 and was working full time up till Christmas.  That was when I decided I needed to focus more on myself - emotionally I wasn't up to working anymore.  Many women are able to continue to work but I've been very happy with my decision. I'm not sure when my double mastectomy is going to be done.  Probably right after chemo at the end of March/first of April.  Then rads.  I've already decided that I'm not going to deal with reconstruction for now.  Later - if at all. It's one step at a time.  Focus on the treatment in front of you.  Thinking about all of it is too overwhelming.  But working it piece by piece is very doable.

I'm very sorry you had the problem with your vein and the contrast.  I've had 6 MRIs since last July (4 of them were to monitor my chemo tx) and I know how stressful they can be.  To add a bad experience like you had adds even more stress to the procedure.  Talk to your doc and make sure that prior to your next MRI that your given Ativan to relax you and make the stress more bearable.  It's a very reasonable request and it will help.  I'm hoping you have clear results.  And please let some of the fear go into living the life you have right now.  You have a good doc who is doing the right things.",

It was a rough week but I think (both hands in the air - all fingers crossed) I might be turning a corner.  Still have a mild headache this morning but my thinking is clearer and the funk is easing. Looking back, the aromasin gave me major hot flashes, problems sleeping, swelling in hands and feet, joint pain (some days nothing - other days it really slowed me down) and the icing on the cake was that my feet become too sore to do any walking other than around the house.  It was like the tendons were tightening and wanting my feet to curl. But this all happened gradually and the first 6 months, except for the hot flashes, were pretty much trouble free.  I had been on 20 mg Paxil prior so we just continued that.  To take care of the hot flashes he put me on Neurontin.  One in the morn and one at night.  Trouble sleeping, even with the Paxil, so increase the Neurontin to two at night.  A few months later and things are starting to go downhill again with the sleeping and so we try 2 Paxil a day - doesn't do much - so back to 1 Paxil and 3 Neurontin at night.  That's were I was for the last two months before I hit my limit on the headaches and hand/feet pain.  Now I'm taking at least 1 Vicodin a day for the pain, sometimes two. So I see him and the plan is that I stop the Aromasin, wean myself off the Paxil (Paxil doesn't play well with tamoxifen), maybe cut down on the Neurotin if the hot flashes reduce as the Aromasin leaves my system.  Then I start back up on Tamox and Lexapro.  Effexor was the first choice but I had a face rash after taking that for a week once before so it's off the table. So this Tuesday I started the Tamox and Lexapro.  But I was an emotional wreck when I was in his office.  So we also added an appointment with a counselor next week. In the meantime, the funk, fuzzy thinking and headaches are driving me bonkers.  Last Sunday I was sitting here on the boards thinking that I really needed to get away from the PC and go take my shower.  Wait - my hair is wet. I already took it and I had no memory of it.  That really spooked me.  And I think my actions were spooking my DH, too.  So he gave me the OK to do whatever I wanted with the Neurontin depending on how my hot flashes were doing.  So I stopped it.  Zip - nada.  And because I stopped the Aromasin the hot flashes are no longer a problem.  No Neurontin has really improved the fuzzy thinking. But the headaches continued, just milder and slightly different than the original killer ones.  We have have a PA and parttime nurse at my company so I went to those guys to ask for some aspirin.  The nurse heard my story and she firmly believes it's the Paxil that is causing my remaining problems.  She tells me that she has seen people who need to wean themselves over the course of 10-12 weeks.  Literally down to taking a shaving off the pill for the last week. So right now I'm only taking Tamox, Lexapro, and Vit D.  We'll see if I can get past the last of the headaches and start getting back some energy again.  I also hope that I click with this counselor.  I just have a lot of stress right now with the med changes, guilt for alll the work I'm missing and trying to help my father/mother with their lives since dad has dementia and it's just about time to get him into memory care. I'm really tired of drugs and SEs!!",

Casodex is the anti-testosterone drug that they use on men for prostrate cancer; other anti-testorerone drugs are also being looked at for the treatment of mets. Being postive for androgen receptors is not correlated to estrogen positive. So this treatment option is also a possibility for triple neg ladies.",

I am not a hypochondriac and I am sure that you aren't either.  It's not our imagination.  We get pains that we've never had before.  Sometimes for a day and sometimes for weeks.  I was hoping my getting off Aromasin would bring me some relief.  My feet are a little better and my hands a little better but it's been 3 weeks off and I still get headaches, swelling in my hands, on/off hip pain and today my lower back is as tight as a drum.  The only good thing is that I'm weaning myself off paxil and I haven't noticed any deteriation of my moods. I don't have answers.  I've been struggling to find answers for myself.  I just wanted to let you know that I'm in the same boat.  Why can't we have  just have a positive attitude and we get our old bodies back?? Grrrr! I just went through the same thing on the vacation bit. I was feeling pretty bad but I was scared to go to the onc and find out negative news right before we left.  Specially because it was a wedding for my late sister's daughter.  I wanted cancer out of my mind during her special day -- I knew she was wishing her mom could be there and I didn't want to be a reminder. Well, hubby insisted I make an appt.  He was right.  Everything is negative.  That's when the onc said to stop taking the Aromasin and we'll switch to something else after a 4 week reprieve.  I also asked for something besides Ativan since that does nada to help me sleep.  The Xanax works much better for me so at least I have a crutch if it's one of those anxiety nights. The vacation would have been much worse if I hadn't gone and I was still thinking those \"what if\" thoughts.  My body didn't improve much but my attitude did. ",

My feeling is go for it.  Your docs are looking out for you and trying to kill any cancer cells that might have escaped.  It sure would be great if we had a test that would tell us if they are all gone or not after we finish the standard treatment.

Just because I'm going through a similar situation and am very familiar with Vicodin. I had been taken Vicodin for over two years. But that was for the tension headaches thatt I was getting. Tylenol didn't do anything. But as soon as that hydocodone was added then 1 or 2 tabs would kick the headache for the next 4-5 hours. Then it was time for 2 more. Onc switched me to methadone. One of the SEs is drowsiness. Which means it relaxed my muscles. And that neck/shoulder concrete necklace that I had finally started to relax. I actually started to get my neck to crack on a daily basis. No headaches so no need for Vicodin. Personally, I try to stay away from Tylenol because they stick Acetemetecin(sorry about the terrible spelling) in to so many products. I don't want to damage or weaken my liver any more than I already have. So for the last two months my CA 27.29 went down 18 pts and then 13 pts. Currently at 142. But my lower back hurts more each day. I mentioned that there have been a couple of times when I would like to have something fast acting while I wait the hour it takes for the methadone to kick in. He did prescribe me Voltaren Gel. Basically topical Ibuprofen that I can use in addition to methadone. Lasts 8 hours. Tried it today for the first time and wasn't impressed. So is it more cancer or is the Femara starting to generate the pain? I do have a pelvic MRI sheduled for next Wed. Guess if nothing shows up then it's the Femara.",

Yo - the weekly AC has been great.  Monday is 12 of 15 so I'm finally getting there.  Fatigue is getting worse though.  Last Tuesday my cat and I had a sleeping competition and I think I won.  Must of slept 16+ hours with all the naps.  The worse thing right now is my fingers.  The nails and tips of the fingers are painful.  It's getting harder to grip things.  Don't have a clue what that's about.  Should be getting an appointment with my surgeon set up this next week.  I'm going to be so glad to move to the next phase. Meant to mention that I'm sold on the neupogen shots for the WBCs.  Trial protocol requires 6 times a week but it would probably be less for regular protocol.  Never get any SEs.  Keeps the WBCs up.  RBCs -- different picture.  Had my 3rd transfusion last week and I'll probably have to do one more before I finish.

I agree with the original rant.  Being respectful.  It doesn't matter if you're stage x posting on stage y or if you are a fellow stage 3er posting back to another stage 3er's post. In my mind \"posting\" and \"advice\" are not synonymous.  There are topics that aren't about asking for advice -- they are just though general daily life topics that all stages deal with.  I love diversity and on those topics I enjoy reading all the different perspectives.  Some I agree with.  Some I can't relate to.  Then there are those topics where women are looking for help.  Often those topics are related to their stage.  If for no other reason, because of their mental state.  These are the topics that it is so important to pause and consider if your stage/experience is really appropriate.  As an example, if a women is talking about the fears and questions about follow up scans she receiving as a 1 or more year survivor then I don't feel I can add much.  Even those I'm also stage 3 I haven't been there emotionally or medically. I've seen and experienced criticism from stage 3er to stage 3er.  At least I took it as criticism.  But I guess that's a point I would like to make.  I'm in treatment, I don't sleep well and I'm still trying to get used to the idea that my dx is the same dx that ending up taking my sister.  So please consider where I'm coming from before you take a stab at me because I do think very carefully before I post.  And it's a different emotional roller coaster for the women in the initial or later phases of this journey. I don't criticize when I read something I don't agree with.  But if it's advice and it' medically incomplete or wrong then I will add my comments.  I want to help other women just like I've been helped.  But I try to be respectful.",

The first was my niece from my first marriage. She was a year younger than my DS. Both my SIL and both went on to have another daughter so there were 4 cousins (her two and my two) and they spent lots of time together. This niece however, was just a little different. I don't really want to say that she had an evil streak, it wasn't that dramatic, but she would do things to her sister or against her mothers wishes that seemed kind of unnerving. But she also seem to not understand why she did those things because she clearly wanted to please her mother and she loved her sister. She is now an adult and my DH believes she has Asperger's Syndrome. Her mother is a wonderful, caring person. She struggled with her daughter -- she wanted to be the best mother that she could and she tried so hard to help her daughter be more \"normal\". Clearly this was a case of something that was totally uncontrollable. Back then we barely new about autism let alone something like Asperger's. Or maybe it was something completely different. We don't know but she is remote to her mother and continues to turn people away because of her hurtful social actions. The second one is one of my husband's grandsons. His daughter is a very loving mother and does a great job of keeping a stable family life (two more sons who are younger) with lots of support for the kids and their interests. But this kid is scary. I'm not exaggerating. My DH and I have talked about it quite a bit. He has always had an infatuation with guns (they are a hunting family but this goes beyond the normal interest) and he was always seeing animals, bugs, birds, whatever moves, as something to kill. He also has been unnaturally assertive. He was about 5 years old and visiting us; he and I are in the my flower garden and when he wasn't squashing bugs he was telling me how he could cut all the flowers down. When I tried to explain how I didn't want that and that I enjoyed the flowers it didn't make any difference -- he just looked me in the eye with a flower in his hand telling me that he could pull this out right now. I picked him up and we went back into the house where his mom was. When DH and I have heard about young kids getting into hunting accidents or even diliberate killings we have wondered out loud if this kid is going to be on the news one day. He feels like a sociopath to me. But talking about this to his mother is not going to happen. She believes he is a good kid who just needs more growing up. We don't share her confidence. To see these children who are different from the time they are developing in their second year through when they become adults (in the case of the niece) has been an awakening for me. These are not problems that are solved by drugs or changing their peer group or any other external fix. And the mothers (both kids have very loving stepfathers) are stable, good people. I just wish they had worked with a psychologist or psychiatrist a long time ago.",

I personally haven't taken the affinitor/aromasin treatment but I know that some women find that combo hard on the SEs.  If you are experiencing fatigue then I would suspect this treatment first.  But this is where you need to talk with your onc and weigh the benefits against the side effects.   Depression is common for all of us.  It doesn't matter if it is being caused by a drug or just the reaction we have to our chronic disease.  I strongly recommend that you talk with your onc and try an anti-depressant.  There are lots to choose from and it is amazing how they can turn around a person's outlook.  I'm on Lexapro and it makes a big difference in my daily life. I take  the following: velaparib (PARP Inhibitor to fight cancer), Xgeva (bone strengthener), Lexapro (anti-depressant), methadone (pain med), oxycodone (pain med), prilosec (indigestion), temazepam (sleep aid), neurontin (eliminates hot flashes), ritalin (combats fatigue), along with some vitamin D, stool softener and calcium.  I don't really like taking so many meds but they each have a purpose and they keep me in a good place.  I've tried cutting back on the pain meds, the neurontin, the prilosec and each time it was a failure.  It just got things out of balance and it would take me a week or so to get back to being on an even keel. So my message is that the number of meds isn't necessarily important.  What really matters is what the meds do to you and are you needing some other meds to counter the side effects of the treatment.  Talk with your onc and let him know your concerns and your issues.  Fatigue is a hard one and for the most part we don't have good answers.  I do take a small dose of ritalin to try and counter the fatigue but for the most part it has just been something that I have to accept.  But you might have other options.  Hopefully your onc can get some answers for you. Hope this helps.",

I met the dietician and social worker because they would come to the infusion room and look for people they had met. So that was where you had your introductory meeting. And since I was there every week I would just wait till I saw them in the infusion room if I had a question.

And some work better for some women than others. And to top it off, some meds have a potential to reduce some of our SEs. Two drugs that I am aware of that can be helpful for SEs are Effexor (reduces hot flashes in some women) and Celexa (reduces neuropathy flare ups for some women). Unfortunately I got a rash from Effexor so that one wasn't an option. It does sound like you should consider a daily anti-depressant med. I started with Paxil which was great for making me feel more positive and energetic. Unfortunately it interferes with tamoxifen so I had to get off of it. Then I discovered the nasty side of Paxil -- it is an extremely hard drug to quit. The side effects of headache and emotional vulnerability were terrible. Then it took me a month before my Lexapro kicked in. So that was two months of hell that I don't want repeated. I really liked Paxil but I would stay away from it. My onc just switched me from Lexapro to Celexa. It was an immediate switch -- taking the Lexapro one day and the Celexa the next. He wanted me to try it to see if it helps with my neurapathy. I've been on it for a little over a week so it is early to say that it definitely helps. It appears to be helping. I also have ativan in the med cabinet. I have had a full blown panic attack (had to go to the ER) so I know had bad those can be. The ativan works very well for me if I start to get that anxious feeling. I also use as a preventative measure before especially nerve racking appointments and before many of my scans. I used to measure my scans by a \"one ativan\" or \"two ativan\" scan. An example of a two ativan scan for me is the brain MRI. Makes me very, very anxious. My ativan is also .5 mg. It doesn't work for me to take ativan as a nightly sleep aid. I got better results from 10 mg of melatonin. Now I am on temazepam for sleeping. Hope this helps.",

I have to say that I have been very happy about getting a bmx and no recon.  They didn't touch the lymph nodes on the good side -- I didn't even want the SLN because we didn't see anything on the MRIs and I wanted them left alone.  The right breast biopsy was completely clear.  But I don't regret having it removed!  I was strongly advised against recon for at least a year after tx.  The bmx was last April.  From the minute I put on the mast bras and forms I just loved the way they felt.  Having nicely shaped boobs that were higher up on the chest again felt great!  I got to pick my size and, if for some reason I want to change, I can go back and get a different size.  Can't just walk into a store and get a bigger set with recon! I have a friend who had a single mast and hasn't had her recon done yet.  She hates her bras and form.  But we've compared notes and we think it's the difference between a matched set of forms versus trying to match a form with the real thing.  So she is looking forward to getting the recon surgery done. As for me, tomorrow is my ooph surgery and I hope that is that last time I go under for a long, long time.  I'm tired of surgery.  I'm 52 and the forms give me the look I want in public.  At night I get to take 'em off, get into my jammies and kick back.  My DH doesn't mind one bit.  He just wants me sitting there relaxing with him for many years to come.",

Unfortunately we are all different and some cannot handle the standard chemo regimens.  But there are different chemo drugs and different ways of administering them.  For instance my AC was done as a weekly Adriamycin infusion and a daily Cytoxan pill.  Nausea was handled with Zofran and reglan - no real issues.  Fatigue just meant I was in bed at 6-7 every night and slept till my normal get up time of 5:30. I was 51 when I went through my chemo and in good health.  I feel that I'm about 75% of where I was last year before starting treatment but I'm just finishing radiation and am still on a low dose chemo.  It won't be long before I'm 100%.  I believe it's reasonable that your mother, who started with good health, should be able to get through this tx without all these major health issues.  Is the doc so focused on eradicating the cancer that he's forgetting about the human patient? It doesn't feel comfortable knowing that the cancer is still inside her but she has to be back to a healthy state to get through the surgery.  Sharon has a good question -- have they been tracking the effects of the chemo on the tumor with scans (MRIs or maybe UltraSound)?  If not, then I'd definitely be looking for another onc.  It was almost 6 weeks after my last chemo before I did surgery and there was no changes in that time.  Even with my grade 3 cancer it wasn't spreading that fast.",

My thought is to not waste the energy blaming the onc.  Some women just don't handle chemo very well due to their biology.  But it does seem that it would be worthwhile spending that energy on finding a different onc to get a second opinion.  It may not bring any new information into the equation.  But the relationship between a cancer patient and an onc is a long term commitment.  Even after the initial tx there are years of visit back to the onc.  You want to have a doc that your mother feels she can talk to, will listen to her and will respond with her best interests in mind.  If you can get an appointment set up with a new onc then be sure and ask for copies of all her scans, lab work and doctor notes.  Ideally the scans should be both the notes and the electronic copy of the actual scan.  Hand deliver them to the appointment.  It will ensure that the new doc has them for review.  You mention shots for her blood levels.  There are two types.  Neupogen and Neulasta stimulate the white blood cell production.  Procrit and Epogen are used to stimulate red blood cells.  However there are studies that indicate the use of Epogen or Procrit may stimulate cancer growth.  My onc will use them in limited use but not as a regular supportive drug. Is your mom on an anti-depressant?  If she is able to handle it, after all the other issues, it might make a real difference for her going forward.",

We have, and will continue, to talk about what we want in the event of my passing. When it comes to having a funeral, celebration or nothing at all - that will be up to him since he would have to do some of the organizing, letting people know, etc. I won't care since I won't be there (at least not consciously). But I should have another set of last wishes for my adult kids if DH passed before or with me (such as a car accident). Luann - I think you've been given some great suggestions. I understand why it would be easier to talk to all the kids at one time. They all get to hear the same words, you don't have to repeat yourself many times, and if any kids have any questions or objections than everyone knows the answer or what the future issue may be. But I do think you need to lay it out for them. Even as older adults it is very hard to come to a common ground on such an emotional topic as a parent's passing. Young adults would have a harder time. Definitely decide where you want to be buried and let them know. They are young - careers or spouses may take them far away from Ohio, Michigan or even the US (both my kids are in Canada). I had already decided to be cremated and have spent a lot of time figuring out if I wanted my ashes in a cemetery or not. I have finally decided that I want them spread into the wind. That way my kids will be able to visit me whenever the wind blows no matter where in the world they might be.",

Positive for BC but no other tx.  I find it amazing, now that we know she is BRCA 2+ that she had no more BC until this last May. That was stage 1 and she had a lumpectomy and rads.  Interestingly, she had a hysterectomy not long after the first dx due to something (fibroids?? I don't remember).  Did that reduce her risk??  The sad part is that she now feels very guilty that she has been able to survive cancer but lost her daughter to it.  I do what I can to help alleviate the guilt.  The hardest thing I have ever done was to tell her that her remaining daughter was dx'ed with stage 3 BC.  But her immediate response was, OK - what do we need to do to get you through treatment?  Having her help me through this has been wonderful.  And I think it's been good for her to know that she is helping me. BTW - she turned 81 last May.",

I just finished posting to a topic that I started where I was trying to understand if locally advanced breast cancer was a subset of stage III.  The answer is that it's not subset and it can has some various in definition but as a general rule it's all stage III and stage II with lymph node involvement.  But in the course of posting, thinking and researching I realized that my real question was why aren't all these women getting neo-adjuvant treatment like I am.  So, even though I'm now on week 8 of chemo, I finally asked my onc along with doing some research on my own.  It was a good conversation and it re-confirmed my initial decision. For me, neo-adjuvant fits my tumor presentation (er/pr+, grade 3, moderate proliferation, ILC, ) and it also fits how I personally want to attack it.  And since my health has always been good (don't even have allergies) there was no reason not to go that route.  Since I have multiple tumors, including 1 under the nipple, I have been told that breast conservation is not an option.  And due to family history I don't consider breast conversation an option.  But if the tumor is reduced because of chemo it is going to make me feel better knowing there's a chance that any cancer cells that might have escaped the lymph nodes are also being killed.  With surgery first I wouldn't know that and, because of my family history, I need to have that knowledge or I will forever be wondering in the future.  Even though it probably won't have any significance statistically on my long term prognosis.",

I am so glad that you listened to your gut and didn't accept the \"wait for 6 months\" answer. What you described sounded like classic lobular cancer. Doesn't get picked up on a mammo; the best diagnostic tool is the MRI. I am also glad that you are getting the genetic testing. BRCA + cancers have some specific treatment tools such as PARP Inhibitors. If you already know the pathology of the breast mass then you can fill in your profile information which will help us understand your cancer and women with similiar cancers can step up and talk about their treatment paths. If your cancer is lobular then there is a good possibility that it is slow growing. The grade that the pathologist assigns is a method of understanding the aggressiveness. Normally ILC is grade 1; in my case it is grade 3 and it did change quickly when I decided to go in for my annual mammo. It was the pain that I had that was the clue there was more going on when the mammo didn't show anything. It will get better as you learn more about your cancer and the many treatment options for your situation. You are still in the waiting room and that is the hardest place to be.",

You questions about scans or additional testing is a good one to ask your surgeon.  Since you will be doing surgery first I'm sure he will be making further decsions based on the pathology that comes back and what he finds in the breasts. I went pretty quickly on my staging. The surgeon could feel my lymph nodes and didn't like the changes she could see in my left breast (and they happened very quickly) so she did an excisional biopsy the next day.  She removed 1 tumor with positive margins and new there was a least one more.  So that was why I started getting all the scans right away so my onc could decide on treatment.  Went with neoadjuvant chemo. ",

All - Well I mentioned that my BS didn't call back on Monday with the path results.  She did leave a message Wed with some of the information but that we could talk about the lymph nodes during my visit on Thursday.  So, as I feared, she wanted to wait to give me the news.  Turns out I had 14 of 17 lymph nodes with cancer.  Since I had already gone through neoadjuvant chemo we really didn't expect this.  It moves me from stage IIIa to IIIc.  And it looks like there is going to be more chemo in my future. I've already posted on the stage III forum and have gotten some good advice from those ladies.  Unfortunately some of them have been there before me. Took my DH and I a few days to absorb it so I've been absent from the boards. The good news was clear margins.  And it was really good news to hear that no cancer was found in the skin or nipple.  I had had some symptoms that were suspicious of skin involvement so it was great to hear a positive.  Absolutely nothing in the right breast so my decision to leave the lymph nodes alone on that side was the right call. Healing is going well.  One drain left but it really doesn't bother me.  Much better than 3!! Like many of you I also have various sensations as the nerves are coming back.  The burning and heat rash feelings are the worse.  I'm still taking an oxycodone to take the edge off.  However I woke up a couple of nights ago because it so bad and ended up taking 3 oxy's before it finally got better.  I'm just glad that I'm getting nerves and feelings back so I'll put up with this for a while. My DH has been great!  Not only does he see the scars but he's the one who's been stripping the drains, changing the dressing, putting on the aqua guards so I can take a shower.  I absolutely love the man!",

The BS who did the surgery is in Seattle and she gave me the OK to have a local surgeon take it out so I would have to make the 2 hour drive down there.  So my onc set up a visit with a local surgeon and I brought my drain charts.  I was all prepared to have him look at the chart and say no.  Much to my surprise he took one look, asked if it had been leaking around the bandage (yes) and said that it was blocked and needed to come out.  It had a lot of junk in the tube that we hadn't been able to strip out and I guess he figured that if it had been able to drain normally I would have been below 30.  I haven't had any problems with fluid build up after it was removed. Now I didn't do recon so I don't know if that matters.  But the BS had told me that it's not unusual for neoadjuvant chemo gals to drain longer.  So I chalked it up to that.  I'm assuming that you're close on volume also.  Do your best to get them to take it out.  Question the effectiveness of it.  Tell them it's leaking.  Tell them that it's making you depressed.  Whatever you can think of!  Enough is enough.",

The other thing I found out with my first visit is that I was being too aggressive on my stretching.  She says with cording that if you stretch too far then it actually causes the tendon to respond by shrinking again.  So I just get to the tense point when I stretch now and no further.",

Whether they are labelled \"mistakes\" or \"misfortunes\", they are part of living life and the only way they won't happen is if you are no longer living. So understand that these mistakes/misfortunes are going to happen and it is all about what you learn from them and how (or if) it changes your life. However I would like to gently challenge what you said about the regret of not having another child. If you could have been guaranteed that this child would have ended up being the support and companion for your first child, then I would call this a regret. But since you cannot predict anything about what a second child may be like, I would call it a wish for another child who could have been a support and companion. Had you had a second child you have no idea how the child would be either as a youth or as an adult. I have seen too many instances of other people who seem to be good parents, living in a supportive community and good lifestyle yet their children ended up being nothing but heartbreakers. As parents we do the best we can but there is an innate uniqueness in each child and sometimes that uniqueness borders on sociopathic tendencies. Any one of us could give birth to a child who could have very little conscious or be apathetic to other people's needs or hurt. Or their peer group has a stronger influence than anything the parents exposed the child to and they end up with drug issues or other problems with the law. We can wish for a child that will be who will be the adult that we can be proud of, but sometimes the ability to raise that child into the adult we want is taken out of our hands. Please don't regret that second child. But leave it on the list of wishes.",

      "Content": "Aug 27, 2013 01:21PM AnacortesGirl wrote: What wonderful, thoughtful topic! My belief is that you can only regret those things where it was up to you to make a decision. However we do have the ability to \"wish\" that things were different where we didn't have any control. The reason I believe this is important to differentiate is because guilt, which can be a very negative emotion, can often be tied back to regrets. For instance I do not believe we can regret getting breast cancer. We had no control over it. No decision making where we could say \"hmm, I think I'll skip my veggies and have another drink even though I know this is going to cause me to get breast cancer\". Unfortunately I do think there are women who feel guilty about having the disease. Even though they made no decision to have, or not have, breast cancer. Here is another example of how guilt can be tied to regret. My daughter, when she was 18 and just out of high school, told me that she had bought tickets and was going to Hong Kong for a month. Alone. Had I taken the stance that I was totally against it and that she was going despite my belief that it was dangerous and foolhardy, then I have no doubt I would have had regrets when she returned from her enjoyable and safe trip. And if my attitude against her taking this trip and acting independently had caused a rift in our relationship, I would have felt regret and guilt. The way it turned out was that I recognized that this was a decision that she had made and I did everything I could to support her even though I was scared to death. We talked about it and she offered to call me everyday that she was in Hong Kong. It was a wonderful compromise and it helped both of us feel closer. She did withhold the information that she was going to Hong Kong to meet a girl friend that she had met through the internet. Turns out her \"gut\" was right about that friend and today they are domestic partners in Canada. Her Hong Kong partner is a wonderful lady and they are very happy together. No regrets and no guilt. So I have spent time throughout my life looking back at the things that I thought I felt that I regretted or felt guilty about. Such as my first experience with college. My parents paid the tuition and room/board for my first semester. I left South Dakota and a boyfriend behind and moved to the coast to go to shcool. Mid-semester I couldn't take it anymore (or at least that is what it felt like at the time) so I backed up my belonging, got on a plane and went back to the South Dakota boyfriend. Didn't tell my parents. But they found me by calling the boyfriend's parents. I was soon pregnant and married a few months later. Took me a while to no longer feel guilt or regret for what I had done. But I finally realized that I did what I did because of who I was \"at that time\". Of course I wouldn't have done that again as I grew older. But at that time it was the decision that seemed right. More importantly, as I grew older I talked to my parents about it and let them know that I had grown beyond such a selfish act and that I appreciated the way they did not shut me out. Instead, they reached out to me. It was an amazing growing experience for me and had a lasting, positive effect on the rest of my life. So I don't have many regrets. I've worked through them in my mind and have come to understand how I did what I thought was right at the time. But I have also appreciated how those incidences have helped shape me into a more understanding person. However I do have wishes. I wish that somehow I could have met my current husband back when I was 20 and he was 30. What a better choice than the lazy bum I picked back in South Dakota!",

So let me back up to the beginning.  About 7 months ago I signed up for a Phase I trial using an Extended Release formulation of veliparib.  It has a strange protocol where the dosage that you get is based on if you were one of the first or a participant coming in much later in the trial.  Because I was the first at Seattle Cancer Care, I was only on 200 mg a day.  It was very easy to take and I had no problems.  But the dosage was not effective for a clinical response.  So after the first month my onc was able to modify my protocol to give me the immediate release formulation and she increased the dosage to 400 mg twice a day.  That is where I have been for the last 6 months. The first month of the 800 mg/day dosage was tough.  It causes significant nausea until your body get used to taking it.  For me, that took about 6 weeks.  To begin with I was just taking zofran.  But two weeks in, I called the nurse and told her that I wasn't getting enough relief from the zofran.  So they added compazine.  This seemed to be enough to get through it.  I started getting some SEs from the zofran so as soon as I was able, about week 4, I dropped the zofran and just used compazine and ativan. The only other SE that was affecting me were my platelets.  It is very common for veliparib to hit the platelets hard.  Everything else, CBC and CMP, were holding stable.  Although while I was in the hospital recovering from my gall bladder surgery they decided I needed 2 units of Red Blood cells.I'm not sure how much of that was due to the veliparib versus the surgery.  Or maybe a combination. No other SEs.  That part was great. I started with scans (bone and CT) and then got a CT every other month.  From the beginning we will seeing either stable or a very slight reduction.  I was also seeing my CA 2729 drop by 40 points every month.  It started at 188 and got as low as 78.  But the next month it rose by 7 points and then it rose by 40. The reason that I was trying this drug is because I'm BRCA2+ and they have seen such great results with BRCA ladies.  We were hoping for many months of stable or even regression.  I had been looking forward to taking a PART Inhibitor since I was dx'ed stage III back in 2009.  But after 5 months I had a new, albeit very,very small liver lesion. We were even talking about doing radio frequency ablation or some other method to eliminate it.  And the other lesions were staying stable.  But with my scans at the end of this month, it is clear that 6 months is the most I'm getting from a Parp Inhibitor. It is strange the way I'm getting mixed results from the lesions -- some stable, some progressing, a few regressing.  But the oncs are chalking that up to BRCA cancer - the DNA mutation is in evey cell, not just the cells that have cancer. I could have joined the trial that combined veliparib and carboplatin (this was also a Phase I so there wasn't any randomization; everyone gets the drug).  But the last time I used carbo, my CBCs went into the cellar.  I didn't want to risk that so I wanted to join the monotherapy trial. I have the highest hopes that you will see good results.  Except for the nausea I think you'll be happy with the lack of SEs. Are you triple negative or BRCA+?  Those are the only reasons that I familiar with that get benifit from ParP Inhibitors.  ' Wishing you great success! Let me know if you have questions.",

If it were me (knowing what I know now) and I had been given an option I would go for the MRI first.  Not only would that show if there is something there that may need further dx'ing (potentitally with a surgical biopsy) it would also show the other breast to make sure it's clear.  Had I started with the MRI first then it probably would have been redundant to perform the excisional.  I would have gone straight to neoadjuvant chemo.

At the breast center I go to they have a very comfortable form that you lay face down on.  Your face lays on a hollowed out area so it's just padding around the edge of the face and in the hollow area, where your mouth, nose and eyes are, air is being gently blown.  I've done this locally and they don't have as nice a form and don't have the hollow area.  Not as comfortable but doable.  Your given a panic button in case you need immediate help.  But the techs will be talking to you through speakers and they can also hear you.  The 30 minutes is divided into multiple test that may last 30 sec, 1.5 min, 2.5, etc.  The techs will be talking to you and letting you know how long the next test will last.  So, in case you do have any issues, it is easy to stop, get you comfortable again and move through the next test. During the test the machine will be making very noisy thumping, knocking sounds.  Weird sounds, but I don't find it troubling. Just a warning here.  I was extremely disappointed at my local hospital when I got one of my MRIs.  The techs did not talk to me to keep my informed of how long the next test was going to last or how much time was left.  I just assumed that they would do that so I didn't explictly ask them.  It was on the tip of my tongue and I should have said something.  I find the tech talking to you is reassuring and let's you know that the test is progressing OK and will be ending soon. I have more problems with the PET.  With that scan you lay face up, get velcro'ed so you can't move, and then have to lay there for an hour to an hour and a half.  In my case I'm part of an imaging study so they do 2 30-min scans and 2 1-hour scans.  Three hours total.  Not fun.",

Second, it could make a difference if you know more about your specific mutation.  I am not as familiar with the BRCA1 mutations since I'm BRCA2 but our research found that where your mutation occurs on the gene makes a difference in the percentages.  As an example, here is an except from some research my daughter did based on our BRCA 2 2024del5 mutation : \"Another important factor in risk variation is the Ovarian Cancer Cluster Region in BRCA2.  A mutation in this region has been found to lead to significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer. The region begins at nucleotide 3035 and ends at 6629.  51% of families with mutations in this region have a history of ovarian cancer. But for mutations before and after this region, only 29% and 34% have a history of ovarian cancer.  Our family mutation is before this region, so our risk of ovarian cancer is relatively low (compared to other mutation carriers).  But there is a trade-off here.  Mutations outside the OCCR also are correlated with higher breast cancer risks.\" If there are variations on the BRCA 1 gene then it could be your risks of BC or Ovarian are different from the general statements.",

I know it's probably just my head playing games but I feel like I'm going to start glowing after the next dose of radiation whether it's from a scan or rads. Although the rads got rid of the biting pain that I had, after the second session I ended up with an aching pain in my lower back. The rad onc figures it is because the second set of rads overlapped the first area. It is an SE that can happen where it stiffens up the connective tissues. My second set of rads were applied at half dose two times a day to try and prevent this SE but no such luck. So after it was all done I still ended up increasing my daily pain meds. Thankfully, 15 mg of methadone twice a day is pretty much taking care of it. The reason that I'm mentioning this is that you might find you still have some pain after this is all done. But it should be much more manageable and not the type that can bring tears to your eyes if it gets poked in the wrong place. Just a really annoying ache. So a pain doc might be a good thing. Although I really hope the rads just take care of the pain and it becomes nothing more than a memory. I hope the WBCs get strong soon.

My onc has me on 3 month visits.  Many women go to 6 month follow ups but my onc watches me closely due to the BRCA 2+, no chemo response, pleomorphic cancer cells.  Since my onc has been following me so closely I really felt the other docs didn't need to see me.  Oh well.  He made it clear that he was taking care of me after I was done with surgery and rads.  He chooses to do blood work (including tumor markers) and physical exams.  Scans are performed only if I have a symptom that needs more investigation.  So ask your doc what the plan is for follow ups.  How often, what is going to be done, what to do if your bothered by something (make appt. after 2 weeks or right away?), if there is any baseline scans that should be done, what is the post treatment therapy (hormonals such as Tamoxifen or Femara) and for how long.  Any other things that would help such as Zometa or daily baby aspirin.  Pick his/her brain and bring a notebook to write it all down.",

I'd like to join the group.  Yesterday my onc and I agreed that I was done with chemo.  Actually stopped 1 week shy of the 27 week protocol but the RBCs kept going down even after deferring the previous week's chemo. Like lorieg, I've been doing this since August so it's hard to believe I'm done.... My surgery date is Arp 26.  I've already been to the BS.  Double mast.  They sent me home with all my dressing changes and the antiseptic wash that they want me to do starting a couple of days before surgery.  They also gave me a prescription for 2 mast camisoles so I picked those up from Nordstroms. So now it's a waiting game.  The chemo put me on short term disability but I think I'll be going back at least part time before surgery. The BS said that because of the chemo I would probably be in the hospital 2 nights instead of 1.  And that recovery would be a minimum of 4 weeks.  She said 5-6 was more realistic.  Soon as I'm fully healed I move on to rads. Forgot to add that there will be no recon.  BS highly against it and I want to see how I feel about it after I've been breastfree for a whil.",

I felt so healthy running back and forth all day doing various job and I remember thinking how much I enjoyed working like this. After I finished my stage III treatment I never was able to get normal again. Headaches, fatigue, inability to concentrate. After two years and multiple tries at short term disability I had to finally give up and go on long term disability. Now stage IV and nothing has changed. I should be OK since I only have bone mets and after getting 4 of them radiated they are healing with the other one staying stable. So why can some women get back to a good feeling place and others can't?? I'm so mystified. I'm not a hypochondriac and on my good days I get in a few hours of work (yard or house) and it feels great. I just tried to take a two days trip to Vancouver BC to visit the grandkids (2 hours away plus border crossing) and it was a complete failure. I cried on the way home because my energy level was so low I couldn't do anything special with the kids. Don't get me wrong -- I love being in the same room. But I wanted to take them to the Science center or aquarium or something. I just wish someone could explain this to me.

I understand the fear and the worry.  They'll be taking out level I and II of my axillary lymph nodes.  But I'm really hoping they won't have to take level III.  But, the positive is that the right (so called \"good\") breast is also going to be removed and they are not touching those lymph nodes and so I know that I won't have lymphedema in that arm.  I'll do my stretches and exercises and, until I'm proven otherwise, I'm going to assume I won't have lymphedema in the left either. I'm not going to get MRSA.  At least that the assumption I'm making.  Unless it happens, it's not real.  If it does, then I look at the women I know who've had it and saw that they got their antibiotic IVs and did just fine.  If my 85 year old mother-in-law can get past MRSA then I can too. Don't get me wrong, the fears are real.  But you can get past them and know that you are doing the things you need to so cancer doesn't beat you.  Hopefully my surgical date is still good (Apr 26).  I had a PET done through my trial onc in Seattle and they found some things so the radiologist is recommending another CT scan.  My local onc says this needs to be dealt with before surgery.  So now I'm waiting to hear from Seattle.  I don't want to move to the next level.  If surgery is the way to keep that from happening, I'll do it this minute.",

I only spent one night in the hospital but if it hadn't been for him I would have had to been there for at least one more night.  No way I could have taken care of myself without some help.  And my wonderful SIL, who's an RN, spent the first night with us and helped us take off the outer bandage, change the dressings and showed us how to empty the drains.  We probably could have figured it out on our own but it made me feel much, much better that she was showing DH the right way to do things. I'm really enjoying the sleep I'm getting nowadays.  I only wake up briefly around 3:00 am, take a oxy, then knock off for another 3 hours.  After the sleep issues on chemo this is heaven!

She's probably adding the PET because she expects the MRI to not show any growth.  The PET is useful for catching cancerous cells before they easily seen as a mass on an MRI or CT because it can show the high glucose activity that accompanies cancer cells.  Unfortunately, though, they can show a lot of false positives so they are usually used as a secondary scan.  So the scenario could very well be that the MRI shows no change and the PET confirms that there is no extraordinary glucose activity so it's not cancer.",

It not only protects the abdominal organs, it also supports and prevents them from sticking to each other and allows them to move smoothly within the abdomen.\" I know that there are actually two membranes, one against the abdominal cavity and one around each of the organs, with a little fluid in between.  I have always wondered if, when they talk about abdominal fluid, is it the fluid in the peritoneum.  I'm not sure. I just hope the havalen knocks down all your mets.  Have any of the mets been biopsied to see if their receptors have changed?  So far we have biopsied my liver and bone mets and found that the liver lesions match my original BC (ER/PR +, Her2 -) and my bone mets are basically triple negative.  So I am on a hormonal (fasoldex) and a PARP inhibitor (velaparib).  It's been 3 months and so far things are going well. ",

So we go back to the infusion room to wait and that's when we find out that starting Dec 1 Regence requires pre-authorization.  No coincidence that this change was made and the Azure study results are released.  I'm still waiting to here back from the cancer center if they were able to get the pre-authorization.  I suspect the initial response was no so it's moved up to the onc writing a letter to justify.",

In my case the counselor was helpful for clearing the way on the insurance, assisting us in pulling together the family history and then being able to confirm some questions that I had.  But we had already been familiar with risks and had a fairly good background on the gene mutation.  We now have our genealogy with the known family cancer incidences in a program to help us track the medical history. For us, testing positive was a relief since we knew that there was something going on in our family.  Had we tested negative I think I would have had more questions for the counselor to try and understand why so many of us were being affected. Others in the family are now going through the process.  So far I haven't heard of any insurance issues.  The counselor do a good job of clearing the way and acting as a sold reference of information.  There are still a lot of docs out there who hand out bad information -- for instance I have had a doc tell me that only the mother can pass the gene. Wrong! I recommend it.",
