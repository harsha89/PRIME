It turns out she was waiting for me to ask. I had no idea - I was trying not to be a difficult patient or something. I talked to the doctor about it when I saw him next. He was so mad! His orders were for every three hours and that It should be offered to me without asking. Now I make sure to moan and groan and watch the clock. You should not have to be in pain. Ask your doctor what the plan is for pain. Maybe she just forgot to write you a prescription.",

It is most important that you find someone who is able to make the effort to try to understand where you are coming from whether they are male or female. I've been thinking a lot, lately, about this breast oriented society we live in and how women are often defined by the size or shape of their breasts. Do we want breasts because men expect them or do we need them because they are an integral part of our self image? How much pain are we willing to put up with? How many surgeries? Would we be less likely to suffer a recurrence if we choose this or that? These are hard decisions but the one thing I am certain about is that I wouldn't want anyone to make them for me and I wouldn't want to wake up with any surprises. Maybe even put the decision and surgical plan in writing.",

(Maybe even get a second medical opinion first since you don't seem to believe that you don't have anything to worry about) but I doubt that many medical doctors will have the time or even the interest in dealing with anxiety other than to prescribe an anti-anxiety medication. Although you are understandably focused on the possibility of breast cancer right now, your anxiety may have a compleatly different origin that doesn't have anything to do with physical health. Although everyone is welcome here, It may not be the best place for you to hang out where so many do have a diagnosis. Better to enjoy your youth and your good health (and get regular checkups).",

Please take a deep breath before you totally freak your daughters out. Be thankful that she came to you with her concern and do remember and share your own experience with her.

It would be a good idea to keep a running list of all of the x-rays, CAT scans, sestamibis, etc. that do use radiation that you are exposed to. Include time and place and if you are asked to repeat any for some reason, try to have it done on the same machine- it makes for a better comparison. No one else will be keeping track. Also, I hate to say it but facilities that own the machines love to use them (think $) especially emergency rooms. Once you have a scan that finds something incidentally that they weren\u2019t looking for (like an asymptomatic benign lung nodule which many people have) they will want to follow it for 2 or 3 years to see if it grows. That happened to me and after the third one, the radiologist wanted a fourth because she said it was done on a different machine. (of course no one bothers to ask where your last one was taken- I could easily have returned to the last facility. At that point I said, \u201cHell no!\u201d One doctor told me that if you have had three and nothing has changed, then it is time to stop. Luckily, newer machines apparently use less radiation.

From the Department of Radiology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 75 Francis St, Boston, MA 02115. This article reviews the anatomic and physiologic influences on BPE, the typical and atypical patterns of BPE, and the potential of BPE to confound accurate interpretation of MR images. At magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, both normal and abnormal breast tissue enhances after contrast material administration. The morphology and temporal degree of enhancement of pathologic breast tissue relative to normal breast tissue form the basis of MR imaging's diagnostic accuracy in the detection and diagnosis of breast disease. Normal parenchymal enhancement at breast MR imaging is termed background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). BPE may vary in degree and distribution in different patients as well as in the same patient over time. Typically BPE is minimal or mild in overall degree, with a bilateral, symmetric, diffuse distribution and slow early and persistent delayed kinetic features. However, BPE may sometimes be moderate or marked in degree, with an asymmetric or nondiffuse distribution and rapid early and plateau or washout delayed kinetic features. These patterns cause diagnostic difficulty because these features can be seen with malignancy. This article reviews typical and atypical patterns of BPE seen at breast MR imaging. The anatomic and physiologic influences on BPE in women undergoing diagnostic and screening breast MR imaging are reviewed. The potential for false-positive and false-negative interpretations due to BPE are discussed. Radiologists can improve their interpretive accuracy by increasing their understanding of various BPE patterns, influences on BPE, and the potential effects of BPE on MR imaging interpretation. © RSNA, 2014 Recipient of a Cum Laude award for an education exhibit at the 2012 RSNA Annual Meeting.

There may be a place and a time that feels right for you. For some reason, many people think you are obligated to announce that you have this particular disease and it becomes a hot item for retelling and gossip. Depending on your community, telling can bring on love and support or, on the other hand, it can bring on a lot of unwanted advice or even fear and distancing. You need some time to digest this and decide who you want to turn to for support and just how public you want to make it before you have other people defining you. Personally, I don\u2019t want to be \u201cthe lady in the blue house who has cancer.\u201d",

Then the radiologist retired and the new guy did a biopsy and the suspicious area had already become stage 2. Nothing is more definitive than a biopsy because they are looking at the actual cells.
