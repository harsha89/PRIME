Has anyone had anything similar.  I am new to this and been reading on the Internet, it does not sound good what I have been reading.  I recently just lost a lot of weight which I was on a program for.  I thought maybe that had something to do with it. Thanks. LL Log in to post a reply",

My doctor said when she looked at the area, that she thought it was not a breast problem, she thinks it is a skin problem leision I have to go to a dermatologist.  I am glad I went and got it checked out. Take care everyone, I will post after I go to the dermatologist. LL",
