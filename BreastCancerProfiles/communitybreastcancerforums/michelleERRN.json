My mom was diagnosied with LCIS at 50, DCIS as 52, she is now 60.  She was treated with Tamoxifen, radiation and a lump ectomy.  Her mother was diagnosed with DCIS at 72.  Her sisters, faternal twins, one was diagnosed at 47 yrs, the other now at 52 years.  The later was diagnosed at BRCA 2 +.  No one would order the test for my mother at the time, but she was recently tested.  I never could get a doctor to order a mamogram because it \"was not indicated\", but I paid for one on my own.  The results were \"inconclusive, but patterns of immature califfication are present\".  My last doctor would not order an MRI.  I am not sure where to go, what to ask, or how to find a doctor that will help me. Any suggestions?  Any advise is welcomed.  Thanks Log in to post a reply",
