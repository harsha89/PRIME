I was doing fine emotionally or so I thought but keep checking the time and the phones for any sign of news. Not being diagnosed but feeling so worried about what could be is driving me nuts. I have a significant family hx of BC. My paternal GM passed from stage 4, 2 paternal first cousins (who are sisters dx at ages 35 and 48 both with BMX) and a maternal aunt who passed from BC at age 48. I had my first mammo in 2012 which was normal. I was like a lot of other women I guess who get busy with life and do not make their health a priority and never had a mammo after that until recently (3/24). After months of dealing with fatigue and other aches and pains I finally went to see my family doctor almost a month ago who ordered all the usual screening tests. I was so proud of myself headed right away to make these appointments and get myself on track physically. Went for my mammo a few days later and next day got a call from the breast center telling me I had a change since my last mammo and that I needed to follow up with my doctor because the radiologist who read my mammo is recommending a MRI be done since I have a significant family hx. No u/s or even talk of a bx yet. Had to wait 2 weeks for my MRI so it could be done at the right time of my menstrual cycle. What I know so far is that I have an indeterminate cluster of microcalcifications of varying shapes, sizes, and densities and bilateral indeterminate IMLN. My mammo does state that the bilateral axillary lymph nodes are benign. I have other bilateral benign scattered calcifications all normal for my age (41). I am having mixed feelings. I know there is a strong possibility this is all nothing but its hard not to go to that place where you are thinking what am I going to do if______________(those life changing words). Of course I am assuming my next step will likely be a breast bx and more waiting. The girls who helped get me ready for my MRI yesterday told me I should be looking for a breast surgeon and that even if the MRI does not show anything else microcals are hard to see on MRI. I should still see a breast sx for the area in question. I am confused by this. Isn't the idea of the MRI to get a better look of the tissue around the microcals in question and check for anything else that may not have shown on my mammo? Won't the radiologist who reads the MRI have recommendations? Shouldn't I be able to count on my doctor to tell me what's next? This is one time I want to rely on my trusted physician to guide me. I am a hospice nurse and consider myself very experienced and very knowledgeable. Certainly changes the dynamic when you are the patient. Feel like I don't know or understand anything right now. Of course, there is nothing I can do but wait and as my doctor says it is what it is until we know for sure. I am so early in this process of discovery I don't know if I am over reacting or just being emotional. Who knows, I am here to give my poor loving husband a break from all my anxiety and conversations about what it could be. Yard work, music and meditation has helped but it still creeps up on me.

They were not able to locate the area of concern in my L breast on my MRI but the rest of the report is negative so I am very happy about that. The radiologist recommended a L breast diagnostic magnified mammo which I am having this morning at 10 so they can look again at my cluster of microcalcifications. My family physician yesterday did start the conversation of wanting to order a biopsy and I told him I would like to wait and see what today brings. I will be meeting with the radiologist after and hope afterwards I will have enough info to determine what is next. Feeling positive today üëç  ",
