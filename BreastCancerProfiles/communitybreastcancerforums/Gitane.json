They don't know if current clinical essays are not precise enough or if there are other molecular determinants of response besides Her2.  The current thinking is that the latter is true.  Another possibility may be that there there are micromets that are Her2+ in patients with Her2-  tumors.  This has been demonstrated by several investigators in small-scale studies that measured Her2 in circulating tumor cells.  I am sorry, but I don't have those studies, but I'm sure your oncologist can find them. Analysis of NSABP B-31 outcomes did not find any genes or sets of genes or clinical variables (like age, ER, size, nodes, etc.) that predicted benefit, but they found that women with ER+, 1-3 positive nodes, and t-size <2cm didn't seem to benefit statistically, even those that were Her2+. There is an experimental assay, the NanoString-based HER2 assay, that the NCI is recommending be used in the NSABP B-47 protocol.  It has identified a set of genes, measures their mRNA, and seems to identify those that may benefit from trastuzumab better than other measures.  I believe that this either is or was written up in The New England Journal of Medicine, but I haven't looked for it yet. I was able to get all this info by googling NSABP B-47, then downloading a PDF document (30 pages long) I found on page 3.  It's called \"Final Progress Report for Research Projects Funded by Health Research Grants\" about research done between 2/08 and 12/09, then presented to NCI in 2/10.   I know this is long, but if it will help you I'd be very happy,  Hugs, G.  Edited to add this great discussion I found. http://podcast.researchtopractice.com/podcast/pdf/bcu/BCUTT1_09.pdf Starts talking about Her2 and B-31 down on page 9 with lots of references/history for your oncologist.   ",

A while back I copied this from another poster.  I'll put it here, although I've never tried it.  Hopefully someone who knows more than I do will be along to help. How to post a picture on BC.ORG   Go to: http://register.photobucket.com/ Register....Its free.  Then when you login there will be a prompt to Upload Images and you click on choose files. Browse to where your picture is on your computer.  After your picture is uploaded to photobucket you will see the picture, and several options below the picture as follows:  Email & IM Direct Link HTML Code IMG Code  Click on Direct Link and that copies the picture to the clipboard.  Then when you come back to the post a reply window at Breast Cancer.org and you are ready to paste that picture in....click on the little green tree up by the smiley emoticons and where it says image url put your cursor in there and just hit [control c] and and it will automatically paste in the url in from photobucket.  Give this a whirl.....it is not that hard but might take you some trial and error.  Anyway...give that a try. ",

Second, as others have said, you have found the right place for support. Third, I want to share an information source you might want to use. I don't know how to post a link, so I'll do my best here. The website is www.cancercare.org, when you get there, go to \"Telephone Education Workshop Podcasts\", Click on \"Cancer Type\". There will be a list of workshops given by experts that you can listen to on your computer. The one I think might interest you is the one recorded on 6/4/08 with the title Medical Update on Triple Negative Breast Cancer. It contains very good info. Best of luck to you.

Other screening technologies are not nearly as reliable, especially if you have dense breasts.  Ask to have the MRI done at a good facility with someone reading it who has experience with breast MRI. This will help you to know more about why those microcalcs are there before they do the biopsy.  Biopsies are useless if they aren't fishing in the right spot, or if the cancer they may be fishing for is not a tight solid tumor.  Many times cancer can be diffuse and the biopsies that are not MRI guided might miss it altogether.  You want as much info as you can get right now.",

Even if it isn't, it is still very likely that you will be given an endocrine (hormone) therapy, because the Progesterone Receptor being positive indicates that the estrogen receptor pathway is still functional and endocrine therapy will probably work. The estrogen receptor status can be confirmed and if there is any doubt retested. You will not need a blood test, this is all done on the tumor sample in the pathology lab. I don't know if mistakes like these are made often. I don't think they are, but sometimes the communication between labs, doctors, and patients isn't what it should be. Isn't it frustrating that you and your treating physicians are made to wait? The waiting seems to be the hardest thing because it delays getting on with treatment. In any case, I think the results will indicate you can benefit from endocrine therapy and that's good.",

In the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Huang and colleagues will soon present data suggesting that the MD Anderson Hospital prognostic index can be applied to mastectomy patients. Dr. Buchholz reported the risk for locoregional recurrence following neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy at 19% of patients with local failure of pCR vs 28% of patients with residual cancer, suggesting that selection of patients for PMRT cannot be based on response alone.[22] With the addition of PMRT, the recurrence rate in patients with stage III disease declined from 20% to 9%, but did not significantly decrease in patients with stage II disease (which declined from 9% to 5%).[23] Among patients treated with mastectomy in NSABP B-18, none of whom received PMRT, the recurrence rate was 0% in patients with pCR but 10.5% in patients with residual cancer in which the cancer had not metastasized to the lymph nodes and 20.3% in those in which it had. However, most of these patients had T1 and T2 tumors,[24] suggesting that initial stage, degree, and location of residual disease should be used in determining the need for PMRT after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. I hate stats, but it looks like they have learned a lot about rads in the years after my diagnosis.  I bet they're much better at giving the rad treatments safely, too. ",

However, I wanted to share with you that the very best drug for me to take for the queeziness/nausea was Kytril.  As the infusions continued I needed something that would help me.  I tried some others, but the Kytril really worked much better than anything else.  What didn't work, and actually made it worse, was Compazine (is that how it's spelled?)  Anyway, I have to say I'm out of the loop with the new drugs, there may be much better ones now, but it did the trick for me.

Think of us sitting there with you, just talking, trying to share some of the weight of this the best we can. There is nothing fair about what is happening. You have the right to every one of your feelings. These powerful emotions are our lifeline at times. Anger, fear, sadness, feelings that overwhelm us, are ways for us to bring down the intensity so we can get on with our life. Crying is such a necessary release. Sometimes the treatments make the emotions even stronger. Losing the estrogen in your body has profound effects. I was very sad, aching all over, and was very disturbed by the onset of each hot flash, almost like it took me over before I could pinpoint what was happening and calm down. All of this in the midst of the stress of having bc can be so hard. Knowing what is going on, though, that the treatments are causing some of those feelings, too, is important. Your sleep gets messed up, too, just when you need it most. Be good to yourself and go gently forward. We are here to listen, come again. Gitane",

There is no information about how much they saw. Again, this doesn't tell you much about size, so you really have no idea about how much invasive cancer is there.  It says the cells are moderately differentiated; this means they are Grade 2 or intermediate grade cells. 3.  Behind the areola they found an extremely tiny focus of IDC, also Grade 2.  Tiny is good, very good. 4.  In the top outside quarter of the breast they found some cancer cells, and calcifications inside the duct, also Grade 2.  This means the cancer is contained and hasn't spread outside the duct.  This is good.  Again they don't say anything about size.  The other things they found like fibrocystic change, adenosis, etc. are not cancer. These fine needle biopsies give you very preliminary information.  What are your next steps? ",

What does an intermediate Oncotype indicate for an ILC patient?  It puts us in a category where they don't know what will/won't help us in terms of treatment.  It is NOT HELPFUL.   1.  Untreated, an intermediate has about the same prognosis as a high.  It's our \"possible\" response to endocrine therapy and lower rate of proliferation that separates us out as having a better outcome. (Our relapse may be later rather than in the first 5 years as is more frequent for high)  Not everyone with ER+ BC will respond to endocrine therapy and those who respond initially may become resistant later.  This is especially true for Tamox.  which may not be as effective as AI's. 2.  Oncotype scores, by their own research, are not prognostic beyond 5 years, and slow growing tumors (like ILC usually) are more likely to relapse after that time frame. 3.  ILC does not necessarily act like IDC.   Oncotype may not be as accurate for ILC, especially in terms of response to treatment. In fact, ILC has never been studied in terms of Oncotype and response to treatment.  Some research indicates that classical ILC (Grade 1) is less likely to have a pathologic complete response to chemo.  This does not mean that ILC patients are not helped by chemo. So, where does that leave us?  Traditional prognostic factors indicate that Grade 2 tumors greater than 1 centimeter should be offered chemo. even if the nodes are negative.     ",

We all go to the internet to find out what's what, but it can sometimes be frightening and not too helpful because it is so hard to know what applies to you, especially when a lot of the information is old or not from reliable sources.  Be cautious, don't frighten yourself unnecessarily.  I will say that the diagnostic process is always slow, or so it seems. On the other hand, more information is better for all concerned.  I will keep you and your sister in my thoughts and check back to see how you are doing.  ",

Reading comments on this thread has caused me to look back at my relationship with my oncologist. He talked down to me, and downplayed every aspect of my case at our initial meeting, exaggerating the survival stats to look unbelievably great.  I knew better, and I lost trust over time that he would be truthful.  I confronted him with this eventually.  The more I asked specific questions, the more he started saying, \"There's no way of knowing.\"  At least I do believe that.  I have received good care from him, but there isn't much of a relationship otherwise.  paige-allyson,  Like your oncologist, my oncologist would tell me that my \"anxiety over this\" was not helping, and that I needed to move on.  Honestly, my \"anxiety over this\"  (this was, after all, my life we're talking about) was huge. No doubt I do need to get a grip!  Too bad there is no magic way to do this.  My pace seems to be much slower than most, the adjusting and adapting part.  I am, after all, me. So I do what I can in my own way.   Each day I learn and change.",

That gives you a place to start. I believe, we should protect ourselves from BC in every way we can. Each of us makes hard decisions about that. We want to be able to look back and say we did our best, and look forward knowing that is the truth. That said, I think it's important to remove any guilt from our thoughts. We are all human. Knowledge is power, but getting the knowledge we need isn't easy. This knowledge exchange board has helped me with that. I wish there wasn't so much uncontrollable uncertainty, but that's the way it is until we conquer the BC beast. Good luck to you.",

It sounds like you had a good experience with hospital staff. It should be better for your mom now that she is back in familiar surroundings and in recovery. Hopefully her future treatments won't interfere too much with her QOL.

Once you've finished your Herceptin there may be no more treatment for you.  Some of us are getting Zometa infusions every 6 months.  You might ask about that.

I took it for about 10 months.  I also met with a breast cancer therapist who helped me learn ways to calm myself, but honestly I didn't think it helped then, it's helping more now. Walking helped a lot.  Staying busy doing anything, didn't matter what, helped.  I think time helps the most.  It seems that trying to work right now is too hard, can you get time off until your emotions can level off?  Can you find a way to avoid the wine?  It's a temporary relief, but ultimately makes you even more vulnerable to the emotions you are having.  The roller coaster ride is something we all have endured, and continue to endure to some extent, though the highs and lows become much less extreme.  Above all know that you are a good, normal person and you are in the middle of a very extreme situation. Nobody is all that brave, we are all scared.   Give yourself all the gentle understanding you can, don't judge your actions, thoughts, or emotions too harshly.  Let the whole thing roll over you, pick yourself up, and move on to the next day.  Come here and talk a lot.  Or don't.  There is no right way to do this.  Lots of love.  ",

Anyway,  I agree that Adjuvant! adds information to the Oncotype DX score, and the oncologist's experience will undoubtedly count for a great deal in helping make the decision for or against chemo, and/or adriamycin.",

Each year in the U.S., approximately 127,000 women develop ER+ breast cancer, and an increasing percentage of these are specifically diagnosed with invasive lobular breast cancer. \" \"This study continues a string of discoveries the researchers have made regarding tamoxifen resistance. They had earlier found that invasive lobular breast cancer has many more so-called \"gamma\" estrogen-related receptors than the typical \"alpha\" estrogen receptors that tamoxifen was designed to inhibit. \" This is far from being in depth or long term research.  Just thought I'd share it with youl  Giant hugs,  G. ",

You need to live in this void for a while so this can happen.  It helps to let the emotions come as they will.  They will come in waves, and pass. It's scary but letting them come and go helps them to slowly lessen in intensity. Your emotions are on overload.  You cannot think your way out of that! There are ways to look at your thinking, what your mind is doing, that help you observe this and be able to let it go. We do not have to let the \"helpless, hopeless\" messages we get inside become our reality.  Meditation, Yoga, guided imagery, body scans, relaxation techniques taught at the cancer centers are great.  You can learn these and they can help you the rest of your life.  There is nothing wrong with meds, too, to get you over the roughest patches.  Then there is the ever present fear and sadness.  Over time we are somewhat surprised to find that gradually, with no effort on our part, that starts to move over and allow something else.  However, it takes time.  That's also hard for us to allow.  At least it was for me.  I was so sad, so very sad.  I didn't know any way to handle it at the time and it took over my life.  I hit bottom about a year after I completed treatment.  It took me so long because I didn't know what to do and didn't ask for any help.  I've learned since that there are things I could have done, am doing now, that help me.  You are normal.  It's just so hard sometimes.

I think this gene is associated with immune response and the protein is found on/in many different types of breast cancer cells. In each individual it is different.  Tumor markers change over time, serial measurements; it's the percent of change in a given time that has to be interpreted by the oncologist.  Tumor markers are not reliable in 1/3 or more of us.  If they are going down or disease is stable that has to be good news. ",
