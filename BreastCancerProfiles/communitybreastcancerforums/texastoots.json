Just met with the oncologists and my head was spinning. I had pretty much decided against rads and hormone receptor blockers before going but promised my bs I'd hear them out and then make a decision. After hearing the spill, I feel even better about refusing further treatment even though my tumor grade was upgraded to 2-3. I still haven't had a Dr explain to me how if DCIS is \"in situ\" how a stray cell may be out there. They really dance around that question and never answer it. Always the same....a stray cell may be lurking in there so we need to radiate but never an answer to what stray cell if it was contained and you got wide margins. I think it's reasonable to refuse to treat something that hasn't happened yet, may never happen and if it does happen doesn't effect my survival rate. I was also surprised at the anger some bc survivors have had towards me for choosing not to do rads and tamoxifen.",
