In addition to the cord, it feels like a wooden panel is in place where a seroma has hardened and a drain was pulled out.  Went to a PT on April 28th and was given 4 exercises, but I've been doing 8 exercises since March 24th from the discharge PT at the hospital - apparently not enough? Does the cording and the feeling of a steel cable around the chest get better? Do you know how long it takes to feel comfortable for hours at a time? Do NSAIDs especially Advil work?  I had been walking for 90 minutes on a treadmill from April 1 - 22, but the PT seems to think that was not a good idea.  I thought walking was supposed to be the best?  Thanks for any info or experiences.",

I don't think I've ever read anything more descriptive than 'uncomfortable' here on BCO re: drain removal.  Am I an uber-wimp? JanetinVA, why did you go for MX and not lumpectomy? Thanks for the tip about massaging the incision line.  My first follow-up is April 13.  Today I can't even imagine massaging anything it stings and hurts so much.   I know what you mean about trying to overdo.  I actually got many stretching exercises to perform from the PT at right discharge!  Did anyone else?  ForMyBoys - the 6\" rubber band is the perfect description - and I so agree it's worse than the hours right after surgery.  The whole mess just seems so savage.  I want to focus on health, and the future.  But I did everything 'right' and wound up here.  Sometimes the depression is just too overwhelming.  Especially when there is not a single sign of improvement (still no hair, still rotting nails).  My Medical Onc. wants me to see a psychiatrist and recommended one:  a CHILD PSYCHYATRIST!!!  I looked her up on the Board of Registration!  Not an iota of expressed interest in BC patients or any cancer patients for that matter!  I can only take so many physical and mental insults, and this is just an additional one.  Am I being unreasonable?",
