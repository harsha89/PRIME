After only being on it a month, I couldn't sleep, had fatigue, bowel issues that got so bad I couldn't leave my house. The weakness and body pain had me to the point that I couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't even function. After 17 years at the same job with never a problem, my boss came to me and said that I was making too many mistakes and I need to find a way to get it together. I went off of it and within a few days I felt great. I saw my doctor and she wanted me to go back on the Tamoxifen and if I had the side effects again she would have me take a leave of absence from work. There was no way I was doing that. The month on the Tamoxifen was the worst month of my life. Now she wants me to go on Raloxifene. I am so afraid of the side effects? How are you doing on it?",
