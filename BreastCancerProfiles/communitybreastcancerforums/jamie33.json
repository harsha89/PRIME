When the little plastics reared there heads we pulled them out with a pair of tweezers. We kept the tweezers sterile and with all my other \"supplies\" for packing the 5 inch by 2 inch area of dead skin and tissue on my breast that was cut off (I had chemo & rads 6 yrs before that). I chose to not have skin grafts (as it would have been more surgery) and let the skin grow in naturally, which took longer but in the long run will look better. some of it is still pink, especially my stomach incision, but it gets lighter and lighter every week and in a few more months there probably will be no more \"dark pink\". Good Luck Amy, but take comfort that it is ok and \"normal\" for some peoples stitches to not dissolve all the way. I will be having a lift on the other side and revision to an area on the recon side that has a \"lip\" where it isn't smooth or level (if that makes sense) on Nov 7. I'm kind of getting nervous, hoping for no drains and success on smoothing out the \"lip\" as that is in the middle of my clevage where all my bras go (well the old ones I want to wear again).
