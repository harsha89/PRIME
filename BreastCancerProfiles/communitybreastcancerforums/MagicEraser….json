He feels my cancer is becoming more aggressive and the abdominal fluid could become a big problem. I did have a skin met tested last fall and it was still her 2 negative, but the estrogen receptors switched to negative. It's not clear whether hormonals will still work for me but what I do know is I just failed xeloda in two months whereas all my hormonal treatments have bought me significant time. Its all very confusing, and I get the impression that even the doctors don't really know what goes on in each individual case (of course you all know that from experience. ;-). Was just expecting him to say we'll move on to Afinitor, as I've had a list in my mind of how this was gonna go, all the easier stuff first. I cried in the office, which I haven't done in 7 years since my initial biopsy. He agreed to let me try Afinitor/Aromasin but that he would keep me \"on a short leash\". Meaning he wants checkups and tumor markers every two weeks. I know on some level I'm being dumb about the chemo and losing my hair when I have mets growing in my belly, but dammit I'm not ready to look like a sick person and be pitied.",

Markers have increased. I do have symptoms of pain and bladder leakage. I understand this is not unusual for lobular. My concern is that none of the chemos are going to work well for a grade 1 cancer. I also had a very low Ki-67 score. Haven't talked to the doctor yet, I know I can still try Afinitor and maybe Palbocicbib. I'm just really concerned that those are my last two viable options given the way my cancer behaves - that the chemo isn't designed to target slow growing cancer.

Just curious as you are also ILC and I noticed you haven't been on it long according to your signature. I failed Xeloda really quick. Just started Afinitor and hoping I will have a good response like you did, but already eyeing the Palbo too.",

He didn't seem that concerned with the change in hormone status, just that the faslodex is not working (since he thinks anti-hormonals can mask their true status). Although it does concern me that the cancer might be getting smarter. I also don't really believe my bone mets would be Her2, since the skin met was still negative (borderline at +1). I struggle with denial a lot, so I'm the last one to ever ask for extra tests :-). I'm on Xeloda now.",

Are all my bone mets probably the same pathology too?   I thought I was facing Afinitor next but now I'm not sure...Thank u for reading :-)   Dx 5/2008, ILC, 4cm, Stage IV, Grade 1, 19/26 nodes, mets, ER+/PR+, HER2- Chemotherapy 6/1/2008 Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide), Taxotere (docetaxel) Hormonal Therapy 11/5/2008 Radiation Therapy 12/1/2008 Breast Hormonal Therapy 8/5/2012 Arimidex (anastrozole) Radiation Therapy 9/6/2013 Bone Hormonal Therapy 9/10/2013 Faslodex (fulvestrant) Chemotherapy 11/16/2014 Xeloda (capecitabine) Targeted Therapy 2/1/2015 Afinitor (everolimus) Log in to post a reply",
