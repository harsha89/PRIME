Beesie....Thank you, after reading your post, I feel a bit better knowing someone else went through what I am going through. I will be checking it out once I get a bit more money and get an ultrasound but until then, I will not stress as much. You seem to have described exactly what I have. Again, thank you. Lauri...sadly my mom does not work and I dont keep in contact with my father. So, I am in this all alone. Thank you though. Twiddle...Thank you for looking that up for me, I appreciate it. However, I cannot stay in California, there is no work here and I need money badly (like everyone else). My boyfriend will be joining the military soon and in about a year we plan to get married, which will be nice because I will end up on his medical, which would be amazing. Again, thank you all for your replies.Â ",
