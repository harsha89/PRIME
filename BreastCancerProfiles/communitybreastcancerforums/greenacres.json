Good news I guess .....remember I asked my ob/gyn for a 2nd opinion (reading of my mammogram films from another hospital), instead he recommended I go see a breast surgeon so they can \"feel\" my breasts and look at the films at the same time to determine what is in there and decide if it needs to be biopsied or not. The lump is still there and still having breast pain. So, that is good news to me - I think this is better than just having another radiologst who doesn't know anything about my history to re-read my films. I'll follow up again after I see the surgeon.

That's what I do and it works for me.  You should ot have to wait that long for test results it's absolutely ridiculous.  GOOD LUCK and I hope and pray they are benign! :)  Sandra",

I can't wait till doc calls tomorrow with my results as they didn't see anything on the mammo, just the u/S, but I think I'ms till going to insist on a biopsy either way. Thanks for listening.

I'll post back with my follow-up on my MRI though.  Hugs to all!  Sandra",
