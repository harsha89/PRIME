But here I am, friday was 5 weeks pfc and I'm still bald, just a bit of wisp on the top left of my head :(. I used to have thick super straight hair that grew super fast, like inches in a month :( of course I still have to shave my legs, underarms and pluck stray facial hair throughout chemo, ugh. Eyebrows are slowly growing back and my eyelashes just all fell out, ugh",

I have lots of can soup lol I may need to arrange for cleaners to come once a month. My husband will not help, he doesn't do well with anything involving  blood/medical.  I have sitters from 7am to 6pm, trying to figure out what to do after that, since hubby usually doesn't get home until 10pm or so...I'm just praying a lot and hoping for the best possible outcome.  Good luck to everyone! ",

Right now I have about 40%  eyelashes,  I noticed that it starts to thin when it's almost its former length.  It doesn't all fall completely out now,  but there are gaps.  The hair on my head is also not as thick as pre chemo,  I think I have about 60% off my former hair.   The longest pieces are to my shoulder and there's several patches that are 2 inches long.   Luckily no large bald spots. ",
