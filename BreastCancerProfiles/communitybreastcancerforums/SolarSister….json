It must have been terrifying going through all of those check ups. Where you scared or did you manage to stay calm? And the prophylactic mastectomy, I've been asking my oncologist since diagnosis to please, please take my other breast, so they knew I wanted this badly. When the dna test was done she said that while its not BRCA it's clear it's hereditary and that they do agree it's a good idea to do the other side as well. They wanted to wait another year, but I asked to do it earlier. Long story short: I need to excange my implant on mastectomy side because it went hard from radiation, and they where going to put a small implant in healthy breast to make it look more even. I just asked them to take the whole breast instead and they said ok. They must hate me being so persistant ;) And oh, I am so thankful for all the care I am given. My achy back is not too bad, I don't need pain killers or anything. Sometimes I use hot/cold balm on the area because the muscels feel tense, my hip flexors are very stiff too. Well, my osteopath says what it sounds and looks like is irritated ligaments and joints due to stress, to much sitting down, and too little working out. And the hormonal treatment on top of that is not helping. I've heard that bone mets can hurt pretty badly at night while in bed, but I sleep like a baby and have no pain while in bed. Well, this is me trying to talk my self out of worrying sick. In the back of my mind I am terrifyed it might be something... My gut tells me EVERYTHING is mets. I already had a lung scan due to what I felt was short breath, and a bone scan because of a pain in my back. Fortunately they all came out clear. lago: So good to hear you did pass the scans, and that the spots are nothing to worry about.",

I live in Stockholm, Sweden and do have a great breast cancer community there, but I rarely find anyone with my size tumor wich can make it hard for me to relate to them. Even though I wish no one would have to go through this, it does feel good not to be alone. I'm going through a difficult time now because of a number of scans coming up. I have a family history of breast cancer (no BRCA-mutation though) and my oncologist agreed on a profylactic mastectomy of the non cancerous breast, and it's standard here to check for mets before that type of surgery. I'm so, so scared. Mostly because I have a sore lower back and pain in my legs in the evening, witch could be because of side affects of both Zoladex and Tamoxifen, but of course it could be something much worse too. My mother died of breast cancer when I was 22 and the memories are very painful. Well, apart from that I'm an easy going 35-year old gal with two beautiful boys aged 4 and 8 and a loving husband. Thanks for listening, and my appologies for spelling errors :)",

My cancer was like \"pearls lined up in a row\" (what a way to describe it) that had grown into one digusting 9 cm long messy tumor. I guess the way it grew contributed to the fact that it took such a long time for my cancer alarm to ring. I have small breasts and I did self exams every month! My nodes where clear for some strange reason. This is what I try to hang on to a difficult day like this.",
