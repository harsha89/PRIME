Get your biopsy and you will know exactly what you are dealing with.  Just try to keep in mind that most likely it is not cancer.  You are in my prayers. Nancy",

My bone aches from Neulasta started today but thankfully nothing that Tylenol can't control.  Its mostly affecting my lower back and legs.
