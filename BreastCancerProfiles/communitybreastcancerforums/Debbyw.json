Yoga and the gym sound like perfect antidotes for your stiffness and achiness. I'm still a little too pooped because I had immediate reconstruction with expanders placed. Not sure if it was the best decision, but I'll probably be okay with it once I regain my strength and focus! I'll be thinking about you tomorrow!",

I actually do not \"roll\" that way, but it is a very beautiful piece of your faith I figure since my Grandfather was Jewish I get to celebrate too!!! Hey, I read up on banding and found out that it is actually a band of soft tissue that runs usually from the the axcilla area down your arm and has to do with the lymph vessels. Lymph node removal is usually a causing factor. They said that stretching under the care of a physical therapist might help. I wonder if you to suffer from a \"seroma\" which is serous fluid that fills in the now empty area where the breast tissue was. This causes very tender swelling around the areas where your expanders are not. Mine are under my arms and it is quite uncomfortable to wear a bra. Anyway thank you so much for the welcome!",

I was DX on aug.15th with IDC and had a pos. mass in each breast, so on Aug. 31st I had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. All of you women seem so strong! It has already been month and I'm totally fatigued and still painful. (I think the expanders are adding to the pain) I'm glad I found you all, it's comforting to know I'm not alone! Sara, I have the same lemon shaped seromas under each arm, but the PS can't drain them because of the expanders. What is the feeling you are experiencing? And what is \"cording?\" thanks everyone, Debby",
