I'd say 90% of the time, I'm fine and completely sure everything is fine, then there are the times when my stomach drops and I think \"what if it's not\". My husband is one stoic dude, so it's been hard to see him worried, so I have to keep pulling up studies on how Birads 4a's are over biopsied and most of the time could be downgraded to a watch and see status. Which is reassuring",
