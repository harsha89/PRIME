Just received her pathology report yesterday. The report states pt2/n1/mx stage 2b. Her doc has recommended chemo. I am curios to know what mx means as I am clear with what t3/n1 means. And if MX means distant metastasis cannot be assessed. Then why is that. And should I be worried about cancer spread to other parts of the body. Apparently pet scan was not recommended for my mom. Will she now be recommend by her oncologist. Her ER/PR is positive & ner2 is negative. Ki67 is 3percent. LVI POSITIVE Eagerly waiting for your responses. Log in to post a reply",
