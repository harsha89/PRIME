No problems with nausea (the pre chemo & post chemo drugs they give me have all been working fine). The worst complaint I have is that when the steroids wear off (around day 5) I feel really weak and shaky but that annoying feeling only lasts a day or 2 and then every day after is better. Food has no taste, water tastes metallic, and I need to use a mouthrinse to keep sores away. Fatigue, heart palpitations are the other issues. I try to walk outside daily but mostly I just rest and let people look after me. Eat even if you're not hungry. Are you getting Neulasta? Be careful of infections the first week post infusion especially... Do you have a port or are you doing it by IV? If it's IV the adriamycin will be pushed but if you have a port they might just hang it to infuse.",

After that each day is better. A week after my last infusion & I feel pretty much normal except for no taste & a bit of mouth sores (managed with the medicated rinse)The second week is definitely way better. If you had steroids during the infusion, part of the sick feeling is coming off the steroids. Just wait it out, rest, but also try taking small slow walks outside - it really helps. If you had neupogen or neulasta, that can cause the achiness and bone pain. Find out what you can take for it (Claritin or tylenol etc.). Baths with epsom salts can help a bit too. keep drinking lots - popsicles, soup, ice chips, whatever you can. The more dehydrated you get, the worse you feel. gentle hugs",

I hope you guys check it out. I'm feeling pretty much 100% back to normal except taste is still affected. The thing I miss most is the taste of tea.

I want to share that what really worked for me was having the treatments in the afternoon, coming home & eating & maybe a walk or rest, and then I loaded up on all my prescription steroids and anti nausea meds + GRAVOL and going to bed for about 11h. Gravol knocks me out & counteracts the steroids which can make you wired. This way I just slept through the worst \"I feel poisoned\" part. Treatment 1 (before I figured out this method) I felt really bad - just sick and shaky and weepy and I needed people to rub my back and say \"it will be ok\". Sleeping through the worst of it really makes a completely different experience. The next morning I get up and feel totally fine. Hope this helps someone! *of course always check whether your doctors are ok with adding meds to your protocol :)",

On the minus side, you get your spot assigned based on priority of everyone. They slot you in and inform you and you get what you get. They told me originally I would start sometime between 2-6 weeks pfc, depending on how busy the radiology department was (& one machine was down for repairs so that was causing delays) and who was in the queue - people who are needing it for palliative & hospice care get priority.

They specifically said pretty much any moisturizer I have already is probably fine. They do prefer it has water as the first ingredient.

I got stuck in huge traffic yesterday while going to my appointment and was actually 10 min late. It was at dinner time and I under estimated how much more time I needed to add to the commute to account for rush hour traffic. I called from my car and the techs were all mellow about it & just said to relax and not worry.

My one piece of advice would be to get a binder and start asking for copies of everything and keep a file of your reports. You should be able to get copies of all your mammograms, pathology results from the biopsies etc. Hang in there. Once you have your hormone status, they can tell you the treatment options and you can make a plan. Having a plan will make everything more manageable - still scary, but manageable. What you said so far makes sense. They want to test if you're carrying any genetic anomalies (for me that was a saliva test, not blood) and they need to know the hormone markers. Depending on size of the tumor and the markers, you may have Oncotype testing done to help make chemo decisions. Some surgical options are lumpectomy + radiation or mastectom with or without rads. If your lymph nodes are clear, with a mastectomy you can skip radiation but with a lumpectomy you'd need rads. Take the time to read through the material on this site as this will help you formulate questions for your medical team and you will be better able to anticipate what they might suggest. best wishes (Sorry I can't help with the money questions as i'm in Canada)",

Healthcare providers may be wary for using a second language even if they know it for fear of getting things badly wrong. I speak another language fluently but would not want to translate medical conversations because I'd definitely worry about getting terminology wrong. At my center they provide professional translators to cancer patients but I guess the system there is not set up for that? You may be best off hiring a professional yourself if you can afford it. Then you get an impartial professional. Or perhaps there's a student at the university etc who might want to make some $?

Whether chemo is recommended or not is dependent on how aggressive your cancer is, your age, lymph node involvement etc. Also, you may qualify for the Oncotype test which examines some of the tumor cells and attempts to predict the risk of recurrence. Breast cancer is (usually) easily removed surgically but it can come back. Chemo, radiation & hormone therapy are all designed to reduce the risk of recurrence, especially metastatic recurrence, which is not curable. Hang in there. Once the final pathology is in, you'll get a treatment recommendation from your oncologist and if you want, you can get second opinions. If you want to know actual stats, your oncologists can give you recurrence statistics. Of course there's no way of knowing whether you'll find yourself in the recurring category or not. Part of the MOs expertise is the ability to assess and provide a suitable plan that minimizes side effects while maximizing the chance of a long life with no evidence of disease.",

Since chemo damages all fast replicating cells , your skin, nails, hair & your entire GI tract (from mouth to anus) are affected.

I did have massages during chemo but only from a Registered Massage Therapist (ie someone who is a licensed health professional, not one in a spa) fwiw, my skin looked great during chemo.

When I had a weird shadow on my contralateral breast (while I was still undergoing chemo for the cancer on the first side), I thought about what I'd do if it turned out positive (it didn't). Gotta say my initial & slightly hysterical gut response was to ask my surgeon to cut them both off. Not rational from the perspective of physical health but I think we need to also consider psychological health - how much can you handle the stress of having scans and finding shadows and biopsies and possible recurrence. Anyway - my shadow was benign and I never made the surgeon appointment but I've got scans coming up next month and I wonder how I'll react if they find something else that they want to look at. I do know that IF I ever do a bilat mx I'm not reconstructing so at least that part is clear in my head. In the meantime, I think my inclination would be to pick the least invasive surgery just because you can change your mind and go back for a full mx later but you can't change your mind the other way. But there's no right answer to this and again, I think really you have to pay attention to your feelings and emotions on this. Mx is a much more involved surgery, longer recovery, longer pain, potential lifelong adverse effects (lymphedema, pain etc) so I'd be cautious - but otoh, when you know it's the right decision, you'll know. hugs  ",

Conversely, those who do not experience adequate haematological toxicity may be receiving less than their optimal individual threshold dose of chemotherapy. If this model is applied to the context of treatment-related toxicity, it would suggest that patients experiencing toxicity were initially receiving a dose at or in excess of their individual threshold. \" https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32340... Dosing for chemo is kind of standardized for everyone but we know that people respond to drugs quite differently. Was your subsequent dosage adjusted or delayed to give you more time to recover? I had febrile neutropenia and ended up in hospital on IV antibiotics after my first round. For my second round I was way more careful & I did not get sick (but I also switched from grastofil to neulasta so I don't know which helped the most). But some strategies to protect yourself from infection when your neutrophils drop (the drop usually starts 3 days post chemo for me but you should ask your MO about your regimen) -rest; 8-10 hours of sleep per night; my exercise was just going for walks for fresh air in areas where there are few people; but no housework or chores or working outside the home; -no raw fruit or veg; everything was steamed or cooked -no eating out or take out; well prepared foods, thoroughly and properly heated; be careful with leftovers -laptops, phones, tv remotes, light switches, door handles. fridge door, kitchen cabinet knobs etc etc all wiped down with lysol wipe once a day -no guests; my family all washed their hands immediately when coming home; anyone who even thought they had a sniffle wore a mask; I have a corner of my living room where really only I go except when someone comes to wipe things down -my pets were all wiped down (by someone else) with a damp facecloth regularly; I wore disposable gloves when pooper scooping etc. -yogurt daily; my internist thought my infection might have been gut bacteria crossing into the bloodstream due to the chemo destroying the intestinal epithelium; I'm vegan so I use a coconut based yogurt fortified with a culture; I was told not to take probiotic supplements but that yogurt was ok -use sanitize option on dishwasher; whoever empties dishwasher must wash hands before touching dishes -my bathroom is for my use only; a family member cleans it thoroughly every few days; towels get washed daily -no going to stores or running errands; get delivery or someone else to pick up items -I did have to go to get blood work daily for about 10 days; I went at a quiet time, wore a mask, sat far away from people & kept my hands in my pockets or clasped in front so I wouldn't touch anything & I used disinfecting hand gel pretty much constantly. I wear glasses so my eyes are also protected from someone coughing near me or me rubbing my eye or face. If you don't wear glasses you could get a pair with plain no prescription lenses. My neutrophils were essentially 0 for a while & that is very scary. I just kind of pretended that everyone around me had some horrible disease (think of the worst type of infectious diseases you can) and acted accordingly. I hope your next rounds go better!",

One thing you could consider is getting all your reports and having another pathologist look at it all. \"overall agreement between the individual pathologists' interpretations and the expert consensus\u2013derived reference diagnoses was 75.3%, with the highest level of concordance for invasive carcinoma and lower levels of concordance for DCIS and atypia\" I found another part of this study interesting too. They had 3 *expert* pathologists who reviewed the images and they were in accordance 90.3% of the time; I was a bit taken aback by the ~ 10% disagreement rate among the experts. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/... Here are images from the article showing how much difference in interpretation of samples there was. ",

There are only a handful of vitamins that come up as possible helps & they seem to be more about managing symptoms and side effects of chemo. Remember to discuss all supplements with your oncologist because many appear to interfere with chemotherapy. Memorial Sloan Kettering has a database of various herbal remedies which you might want to browse through but note their comment: \"People undergoing treatment for cancer should not receive any dietary supplements unless they're prescribed by a doctor or given as part of a clinical trial that's received Institutional Review Board approval.\" https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatm...

When I sat in the chair I almost said - look, I will pay for your time but let's skip the color, because I wasn't sure there was enough hair to really work with and I didn't know what I wanted right now. But then I thought - well, let's listen to what the pro thinks........ gad, I should know better & just listen to my gut. I booked it for a color thinking a semi permanent something to lighten it up a bit. I was a light blonde as a kid and now naturally I'm ashy light-med brown with about 10% grey. I was thinking that *eventually* many months we'd end up somewhere like this https://www.instagram.com/p/BrG6OnvH_6g/ but that the transition would just be my drab hair a bit lighter and covered up grey. In my fantasy life, the color would take the grey a bit different and it would just look like a bit of texture/highlighting. Yeah, wishful thinking. Thanks for all the ideas. I just feel like I've wasted 4 months of (very slow) hair growth. There isn't much to trim off ingerp. I'd have to shave it back down. Kayak - that looks like an interesting product and cheap solution to try. I will try to pick it up today. Vslush - yeah, I'm considering darkening it up. I've colored my hair all different colors throughout my life but by the time I hit 40 it started to look ageing on me so I've been sticking to lighter shades. When I wear a lighter color wig I think I look younger so I'm hesitant but at this point maybe that's the best choice...? Maybe when it grows a bit I could just color it back to sort of the root color and just leave it alone. I'm going into a heavy duty clinical rotation in January (I'm in nursing school) and need easy, no fuss, fast hair. If I shave it, it's definitely back to wigs because I don't want to discuss my health with patients. I might just need to think this through and and get more comfortable with the wig Thank you for listening to me whine about this. It hit me so hard last night. It's been months since I've cried but I'm still weepy about it and last night I couldn't sleep over it.",

Though my family kept saying I looked like a silver backed gorilla...I love gorillas so that was sort of almost a compliment. I did my hair at 5 months and the biggest issue was the hair repelled treatments. It was so short at the time that I couldn't do highlights so we did an all over color, using a 'natural' product in a really expensive salon. Idea was to lighten a few shades lighter than the ashy dk blonde + grey that it was coming in. instead it turned a really bright orange! Then the stylist had to use some bleach on it to try to take that out. We ended up on a really yellowish weird color. I posted about it here in Dec 2018. I wished I'd not done it. A couple weeks after I just kind of embraced it, used purple shampoo & conditioner on it liberally to keep the orange brassiness down, and then when the roots started growing out, I convinced myself it was looking edgy and trendy. Now it's a total sort of curly mullet mess and I can't decide what to do with it. The roots are longer than the yellow. It's finally long enough to highlight with foils so I might do that but I can't decide on how to cut it. anyway - long story short - hair post chemo is filled with chemo chemicals and does weird things when you try to color it so be prepared for odd results. I read on this thread that this is an awfully common problem. Overall, I'd still do it because as weird as it was - & totally not the look I was wanting - it actually did make me feel better once I got over the omg, my hair is yellow shock",

I haven't bothered to fix my brows even though I have the products to do it - incl wunderbrow. Losing 'tails' on eyebrows is a common middle aged woman thing - the outer half of eyebrows either disappear or get very light colored and don't show. So it's not just a chemo & hormone therapy thing - it's an aging thing.... I do wear glasses and that helps a lot as it gives some definition to the face. I haven't bothered with eye makeup in months though I thought I'd want to try some eyelashes.. When I feel like it I wear tinted moisturizer and a tinted gloss and call it done. Most days I only wear sunscreen & a smile. And hats for outside. I'm tempted by this one but I hate the idea of velcro as it snags on things.

She just trimmed and cleaned all that up and left the rest. She blow dried it smooth and it's not really me (kind of prissy looking tbh; I sort of feel like a presidential candidate instead of like Pink! or Scarlett Johanssen which is more the look I aspire to) but it was interesting to see another way to it and this showed how much length there is so that was nice.

If it comes back again as just a lump in the breast with no spread, then you can cut it out again. But it can come back as metastatic breast cancer - which means it has spread to other parts. Metastatic breast cancer is unfortunately not curable right now. So all the additional treatments are to reduce the risk of recurrence. The doctor should give you numbers if you ask for them. You can also run some numbers in these validated calculators, print them out & discuss with your doctor as the prognostics can vary with each individual and the oncologist will be able to take that into account. Radiation benefit https://www.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/ibtr/ (radiation usually follows lumpectomy; it's the 'price' you pay for having a smaller, less invasive surgery.

That's why the younger the patient, the more aggressive the tretament recommended. I sometimes think we - generic we, not us on this board or anyone in particular - have gotten a bit blase about breast cancer and 'beating' it. 5,10, & 15 years survival odds are what is given in the outcome calculators. I don't know about you, but based on my family history & overall health, I was planning on 40 years of survival; stats for 5-15 are not really encouraging or interesting to me. And we just don't know yet how well the treatments we're on will work decades down the line. We're the guinea pigs, the new data points. For ex. Taxol only became approved for medical use in 1993 and FDA approved it for breast cancer in 2005. Bottom line for me was that from the start I wanted to treat it as aggressively as possible to reduce the odds of it coming back, and if it does come back, to push that recurrence as far into the future as possible. I want to kick that can down the road and hopefully there will be more and better treatments down the line. btw, my MO at first had me pencilled in for TCx4; that was before my Oncotype came back.

I only have Grade. But yes, as said above, it tends to indicate how fast replicating the cells are, and chemo works best on cells that are quickly replicating. Personally I steer away from looking at stats. Stats apply to large groups of people and do not tell you about your own situation. When I got diagnosed I started a blog called \"never tell me the odds\" (from Star Wars :) ) Our oncologists need to think about numbers in order to give us the best treatment & at some point you may need to think about risk/benefit of certain treatment options, but generally, I think it's best to just assume you'll beat it, consider your oncologist's expert advice, and hit it as hard as they say you need to. As your wife's tumor is ER+ you may be eligible for Oncotype testing which tries to predict the rate of recurrence. Remember the thing with breast cancer is that in early stages you can cut it out, do chemo &/or radiation and be cancer free. The problem is it can recur and depending on where it recurs, that can be a whole deal changer. IMO, the whole trick here is to prevent spread and risk recurrence and tests like Oncotype and others can help guide how aggressive your treatments need to be. And you'll discover you're stronger than you think. Consider seeing a counsellor - it can really help to have an impartial person to express your fears. Take care of yourself so you can be there for your wife. best wishes",

If you go on to one of the calculators like Predict you can see what the 5 & 10 years stats look like. http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.0.html On one hand, compared to many other cancers, the fact that so many people will be with us for that time is great. (But I think Predict counts all survivors, including those who had, or are battling a recurrence). But I've already been on the wrong side of the stats once by getting this thing in the first place (even though I was very low risk on paper) so when I see the group of people who did not survive, I do worry a bit. fwiw, I think you might want to ask your doctors if you qualify for Oncotype testing which would give you a better idea of recurrence risk & might help your team decide whether you should consider chemo.",

A radiotherapy boost is usually recommended in the setting of a close margin.\" LCIS in margins doesn't constitute positive margins under our guidelines either. Other considerations are the patient's age and tumor endocrine status. I would recommend you ask to meet with your bs or MO and get answers to these specific questions: -what exactly was found in the margins? What type of cells? -how wide were the margins? -what is the estimate of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence? -please show the clinical guidelines outlining best practices which you are using to make this recommendation?

One big issue that comes to mind is that it seems to me there will be some internal scarring from the reduction in the currently unaffected breast and that might make future breast self exams & mammograms trickier. My thinking is more in line with where you said 'why operate on a healthy breast'. For me, I would not bother with it for purely cosmetic reasons but this is obviously a deeply personal decision. And echoing the post above, I've also read that women have differing responses to radiation so I don't know if it makes sense to try to match now. That is another question to ask the ps I guess - what is optimal timing of this procedure? You didn't mention if you had genetic testing done? That's one thing I'd consider if you haven't as some results might lead you to a prophylactic mastectomy instead. I would also ask your oncologist if you qualify for oncotype testing for your tumor to determine risk of recurrence. best wishes - it's stressful figuring all this stuff out. My inclination has been to focus on the disease and preventing recurrence and deal with cosmetic issues later but there's no one way of doing it so take the time to think about what's important to you",

Then I got dressed and he gave he me his surgical recommendation based on the size & location of the lump and what he thought the best way to proceed would be for medical reasons, and also discussed what the cosmetic outcome would be. He also discussed the sentinel lymph node biopsy, how it works and how I'd have to come early prior to surgery to have the radioactive tracer injected. He briefly discussed that after he did the surgery he would be referring me to an MO and an RO to continue treatments as they prescribed. We made a surgical plan right there and then (because I'd done my research beforehand so I was comfortable with what he recommended), he gave me requisitions for bloodwork and the pre-surgical checklist as well as a referral to the hospital PT who specializes in breast surgery prep & recovery, so she could prescribe proper stretching exercises for me.

I think perhaps surgeons sometimes give a bit of a cheery outlook at first because their part is sort of simple - just cut everything out that they can. And breast cancer is more treatable than some other cancers because they can cut early stage tumors out. But that's not the whole story....

      "Content": "Jun 6, 2018 01:46PM - edited Jun 6, 2018 03:12PM by moth I would like to address the 'gentle' or 'mild' exercise suggestions - this is not what the studies are showing. The studies show that the benefit comes from at least 150 minutes / week of moderate aerobic exercise. (moderate is getting your heart rate is high enough that you're out of breath but still able to talk, but not to sing; for some people very brisk walking, like you're late for the bus, might be enough but for some, brisk walkingdoesn't get the heart rate high enough). Exercise at the right level is the single most impactful lifestyle modification, reducing breast cancer mortality by 40% http://www.cmaj.ca/content/cmaj/189/7/E268.full.pd... Furthermore, there was study of exercising breast cancer patients which showed that runners did better than walkers: \"Significantly greater reduction in breast cancer mortality from post-diagnosis running than walking\" https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ij... While she's recovering from surgery, exercise of course needs to be appropriate. But I encourage everyone to take these studies to heart & start sweating, hard. Regarding diet: the CMAJ study above indicates that there's no one single diet that has shown a clear benefit but avoiding gaining weight is important. Also maintaining cardiovascular health - as heart disease is more likely to kill her than breast cancer. So all the 'heart smart' diets would be something to look at. Most people have increased monitoring after breast cancer treatment. Regular check ups are required with either the oncologist or the family doctor. You can see the American Society of Clinical Oncology recommendations here in Table 1 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/c... best wishes to your mom & you",

My breast surgeon explained that a lumpectomy + radiation has the same overall survival outcomes as mastectomy. Our province wide evidence based treatment guidelines say the same. (BUT, on this board this apparently is controversial information & I've read that some people say this isn't true for all age groups. My perception is that in some geographic areas people do mastectomies way more, while in others, they lean to breast conserving surgery. I wonder if it has to do with what surgeons are used to, or what they can bill insurance for.) My oncologist later expanded on that & said that a mastectomy would only prevent a loco-regional recurrence (& sometimes not even that as people have had it come back in incision lines etc - whatever tiny amount of tissue is left) but that it has no effect on metastatic recurrence. Metastatic recurrence is the one to worry about. If it comes back in the breast, you can treat & potentially cure it again, but metastatic is not curable. I chose a lumpectomy and figured I can always go back for mastectomy later. It's a much more major surgery with more risks of complications (& that's even if you don't choose to reconstruct; reconstruction has its own additional risks) Btw, I'm an A/B cup. Cosmetically my breasts look pretty much the same right now. At first glance, it's hard to tell that a large chunk (I think it was 5 x 6 x2.5 cm) was removed. I think a lot depends on where the tumor is & the skill of the surgeon to get a good cosmetic result. Whatever decision you make, will be right for you. Best wishes.",

Mammograms and ultrasounds can be performed on a lactating breast though you need an experienced radiologist to read the images. This is from La Leche League but written by an MD. https://www.lllusa.org/mammography-and-sonography-... Honestly, I can't think of many differentials, esp if it's unilateral. LCs are trained to consider ibc if mastitis symptoms don't resolve or if there's skin changes. Bilateral you could consider allergy, connective tissue diseases but nothing I think of matches those symptoms. If you don't want to see the breast doc again or don't think it would be worthwhile, I'd consider consulting with a dermatologist and seeing if they'd order a stat punch biopsy of the skin. Mastitis should respond to abx and not present with peau d'orange. Do you have contact with an IBCLC in your area? I'm just wondering if you might be able to get referrals to physicians etc who are more experienced in dealing with a lactating breast and who won't just recommend weaning. Usually the LCs know who in town is good for this. Whether this is infection or not, it needs to be dealt with. A painful swollen breast needs treatment and since the first abx did nothing, you still have a breast that requires treatment. Actually - - since the radiologist who did the u/s recommended the punch biopsy, can you not have it on their order? It was my radiologists who ordered both my biopsies.... keep us posted. I'm really interested and hoping for a good solution for you. ",

I did read about oral cytoxan being used longer term but it was after surgery & chemo & it was meant to prevent recurrence of triple neg cancer (it was in a trial - not sure if it's actually been rolled out as standard treatment yet) Basic treatment for all breast cancer, including DCIS which is sometimes called pre-cancer and is staged as 0, is surgery. Sometimes that's all that's needed but often it's followed by other treatments such as radiation, chemo or hormonal therapy.",

She doesn't want to worry you, you don't want to worry her - so they way to be strong for each other is to have the weak moments with someone else. You can also ask your mom or your dad to email you info rather than doing it in person or by phone. Email is easier to handle emotionally.

They should also be taking notes during visits with doctors because we all forget what is being said when things are stressful. Hang in there.",

Callbacks and repeats are normal - esp if you're not doing the mammograms in the same facility or if they've upgraded their machines. The newer machines are increasingly good at showing very tiny areas. They need to compare to older scans but yes, since yours are so old, I would expect they'll want a fresh second scan to compare it. Whether they do biopsies the same day or not depends on the center but both of mine were not. Most of these things do turn out completely benign so the odds are with you. The source of your pain might be as simple as nerve pain from your upper back- common esp if you're stressed. Hang in there. & maybe decide right now, regardless of how this goes, to cut negative things out of your life and find joy. Fwiw, I don't think the stress thing is as big a cause as other things are, but stress sucks in many ways and affects all health - so it's a good idea to start living healthy no matter what & cut that stuff out.

Even when it's removed surgically, it sometimes comes back and it can come back in other parts of the body (metastatic cancer) and then it's often inoperable; and while there are treatments for metastatic breast cancer to prolong life, it's ultimately a terminal disease.

I'd ask for an immediate referral and tell the MO to send a letter giving his recommendations for the delay but that you want to meet the RO (or perhaps get more than one opinion) right now. FWIW, where I am the guidelines say: \"If the patient receives adjuvant chemotherapy, then RT should follow the chemotherapy and start approximately 3-4 weeks after the last intravenous chemotherapy. ... Adjuvant hormonal therapy may be commenced prior to or after RT.\"",

Patartist - I had the same heart symptoms and was told it's the adriamycin which is cardiotoxic. Resting HR (I wear a fitbit so I know) went up after the first infusion & has not yet returned to where it used to be; lots of sucking air when doing even minor exertion. The first week the resting HR is very high. The second week things calm down a bit but the resting HR stays elevated. In my case it got worse with each infusion so by the time I finished AC #4 it constantly felt like I was sprinting, even when I was shuffling to the bathroom. Things do get better eventually - around day 9 or 10 I see definite improvement (though when I was hospitalized for febrile neutropenia after round 4 my resident was freaked out enough about it to order a 12 lead ECG; they thought I was at risk of heart attack but at the end they concluded again this was just adriamycin induced heart stress + fever causing a crazy high heart rate + low BP) Because I had numerous delays in my chemo because of fevers & low counts I'm almost 3 weeks out from last infusion and was able to go for about a 4 km walk yesterday with lots of elevation changes etc so in my case, things do get better. I start weekly taxol tomorrow.",

If this is going to hang over you, you might want to try to move it up. One thing we all find out on this board: we're stronger than we think. Lean on your friends and family and if necessary, go see a counsellor. You don't need to do this alone.",

Telling women to wean prematurely as if it's no big deal, or waiting for 6 weeks for a diagnosis as if that isn't a big deal just ...UGH. I don't know what to say. I think I'd want to go back, do the punch biopsy now. I think maybe quit breastfeeding just on that side only (though honestly I can't find much in the literature about whether this is necessary) but keep up the supply on that side by pumping. Freeze the milk and you can use it if you get a benign result on the biopsy. Are your symptoms the same? No changes?",

Taxol was way easier for me but mind you - ... while I was originally scheduled for 4 DD taxols because I was hospitalized after my 1st & 4th AC for febrile neutropenia I got switched to 12 weeklies. (my MO told me that unlike with the AC, with the Taxol there is no large benefit to the DD in terms of outcomes and it has fewer side effects when you do the weeklies) Hang in there!",

My surgeon is young, quite fresh out of an oncology surgery fellowship at a cancer research center in the USA. I think young doctors have many benefits - they're usually keen, up to date on the latest techniques and eager to do well.",

Frankly, I think some people give unreasonable expectations of how 'easy' chemo can be. In some parts of the world people still get admitted to hospital for the duration of chemo, and that's how it used to be in the past here as well. We're sick - we're really sick, kwim? You're undergoing a big serious treatment, let yourself be sick for a bit. Rest when you need to, walk when you can, exercise if you can but don't worry if you can't. You'll bounce back quickly after it's over. Are you icing your hands & feet for your chemo? It really does help with the neuropathy so if you're not, I'd start. Hang in there. You started chemo because your oncologists believe it's a treatment choice that gives you the best odds for long term survival, so dig deep & keep going as long as you can.",
