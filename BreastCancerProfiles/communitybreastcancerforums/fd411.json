It knocked it down relatively quickly and is/was all over my entire right (bc) breast, started going to the left side, went under my arm on the bc side and up to my collar bone on the bc side. Ironically I received rads to all of these places on the right side. My rads after lumpectomy plugged up my lymphatic channels in the breast. I find it interesting that rads can also treat skin mets. I hope you can get successful treatment soon; you've been battling this for a long time. hugs, Ferne ",

I think that's good that you had that time.  After the inital shock wears down and you have a treatment plan, hopefully things will go smoothly for you. Being on chemo for my mets has been ok. I'm still working full time and doing what I can. The hardest was the brain mets treatment and I'm still bouncing back from that, but the chemo so far has been tolerable. So I know you can do this and don't even think you're going to die anytime  soon. My nodes had success on the chemos, you just have to find the ones  that work for you.  Try not to worry yourself to death either. I know it's hard, but please try.  I'll continue praying for you and sending positive thoughts, Hugs, Ferne ",

      "Content": "Sep 29, 2007 05:51PM - edited Sep 29, 2007 05:55PM by fd411 Hi Kidsmom, Here's my story. I hope it doesn't bring you down, that's not my intention, but I feel I need to be honest. I had a lumpectomy and axillary node dissection Sept 27th 2006; just a year ago. Final pathology had me at Stage IIIA. I had 6 positive nodes even after surgery, and I did chemo (TAC) before surgery, so who knows how many nodes were positive at diagnosis in April 2006. I did have positive palpable nodes under my arms confirmed at my biopsies. I did rads and the boosts and I was ok for 3 months. I felt really good and was working and getting back to normal. Then I started having pains that I thought were lymphedema or infection related. Scans founds mets. I'm triple negative and these mets progressed extremely quickly and to different parts of the body and chemo doesn't have them under control yet. I had 3 CT scans since June, and significant progression in each one even with chemo. But I'm the triple negative poster child it seems . Mine is very aggressive. In my particular situation, even if I had a mastectomy, I still would have gotten mets because it was already in my nodes at diagnosis and some cancer cells just managed to get away. That's the crap shoot part of cancer. There was no cancer in my bc breast after surgery and rads. I had breast MRIs to confirm that and my other breast is cancer free. But if I could suggest anything, especially if you have grade 3 tumors or are triple neg, or any type of aggressive cancer, and with your positive nodes, make sure they keep an eye on you. Please Get Scans. CT scans picked up all my mets and therefore work well for me. Ferne ",

We are really OK. They might be thinking, you've been on chemo for 2 years and you're still here; they might think that you're dealing with it well, and it also might be a way for them to convince themselves that it's not as serious as it could be and that you'll be around forever. Not like it just happened yesterday. So they don't have to be as concerned and worried as they were when you were first diagnosed. Or could they be trying to treat you as normal as they can by trying not to make a big fuss since you're so far along into treatment?  I know what you mean, though. I try to be sympathetic when people complain about their aches and pains. I sometimes think to myself, \"try having cancer. That'll really slow you down.\"   It's weird, though. We don't want to be treated like invalids, we can still do things on our own, but we do need some help and TLC occasionally. Ferne ",

I got liver mets and lots of progression of the existing mets on that. I got visible node and skin met progression on the Navelbine. I'm switching to weekly Abraxane on Friday to see if this will work for me. Hopefully your body will adjust to the new combination and it will work well for you. Ferne ",

I still have all of the spots, but they are no longer itchy and painful and raised ike they used to be, and they are not spreading anymore. Abraxane worked for stabilizing my skin mets. Ferne ",

This past May, only 3 months after I completed treatment (chemo, lumpectomy, radiation), my bc spread to my lungs, neck nodes and other areas in that vicinity. I'm triple neg, grade 3, IDC and I had positive nodes Now it's almost July and I'm still going through appointments and have not begun treatment. About 2 weeks ago I noticed a rash of bumps on the side of my breast. They're a little itchy. Then just last week, I noticed areas on my breast that are turning very dark. I'm brown skinned and the areas are noticeably darker and have a weird texture. One of the areas is on my scar line, and I noticed another small patch that popped up as well. Good thing I see my onc on Monday because this concerns me. I'm thinking it could be skin mets. But before I start to worry myself any further, I'd like to ask if anyone has had lymphedema cause rashes, or if could this possibly be some kind of skin infection? Has anyone had this happen? Thanks, Ferne Log in to post a reply",

Perhaps it's because I too believe God will see me through regardless of what happens to me. My God has always taken care of me. Through good and bad. Everyone who got me set up with doctors and treatment were all very nice too. But it was a real comfort to have so many people help me with that because I had no clue what I needed to do. From getting the free screening mammogram because I had  no health insurance at the time to the biopsies, to the treatment, I was blessed by having such kind people in my midst. After 6 or so months, and I still had not shed a tear about having breast cancer, I posted a \"what's wrong with me\" post.  The ladies here reinforced that everyone is different and have different ways of dealing with things and my way was OK, too. I'm not a very emotional person, and I wonder about it sometimes. I was diagnosed 18 months ago and am still being treated with chemo. I had a 4 month break from my initial chemo/lumpectomy/radiation treatment before I had to get started on chemo again. Still, no tears. I don't feel afraid either. I don't know. You might stay calm, or the tears may flow, but do what you need to do for you to get through this. There is no right or wrong way. Ferne ",

I had a CT scan and the onc said to stop taking Xeloda and we're going to try Navelbine and Avastin for 3 or 4 cycles and see if it helps. If not, we'll try something else.

It turned out to be a seroma from the surgery.  I finished treatment in late January 2007 and was diagnosed with mets on May 4th 2007. I was stage IIIA when they did the final pathology, triple negative and had positive nodes. I didn't expect that so soon.",

I've been on steroids for 4 or 5 months now, and they really help despite their nasty side effects. My onc has cut the dosage down, but I've had to increase a couple of times to breathe better. My CT revealed that I have no fluid. My problem's from the tumors rubbing against the chest wall or something and restricting the lungs from expanding fully. Hopefully your friend can have her onc do some investigating as to what exactly is causing the discomfort. Ferne ",

I have an appointment for a second opinion, but it's the middle of next month. Thanks, Ferne Log in to post a reply",

I think what is meant is that the onc dept just has to insert and remove the tubing and stuff they used to access the port.  The people who access the ports have to be trained to be able to do it. Not everyone is. Please don't worry. I think you'll be just fine with your port. Ferne ",

Then it started to hurt and burn. Very annoying. My spots were raised and raised brown lesions For me, Navelbine slowed the progression down, but I believe Abraxane stopped the spread.  I don't have any much itching or pain now.  I do know there is a chemo cream that is used for skin mets, but I don't know too much about it.  Try not to panic, my skin mets calmed down rather quickly once the right med was used.

I hear it's normal to have that type of waiting period for surgery. I had a lumpectomy with a bunch of nodes taken out. I healed up OK; my breast surgeon is really good. You just have to know your limits and take it easy if you need to. I worked on the Caronia, QE2 and QM2 for 5 years til I was diagnosed. We were in Southampton alot! I like it there too. Unfortunately, I'll have to sit out the QV. Wishing you the best on the 9th and sending hugs across the pond, Ferne ",
