I'm Juanita and I started chemo September 16, 2010 and finished Feb. 8, 2011.  I have had some pre radiation stuff done and will have a simulation verification on the 24th with my first of 33 total rads on the 25th of Feb.  Tori, I understand the blues. I've had them a bit lately too.  I too want to get on with some more weight loss. I was one of the lucky ones as I actually lost 15-20 pounds during chemo.  I wasn't that sick, just other things I guess.  I was/am way overweight to begin with so this didn't hurt a thing.  I look forward to when I can really start to exercise for weight loss. Scrabblelady, good luck with the Herceptin.  There is a lady in my chemo center doing Herceptin and she is so cheerful and a very nice, pleasant personality.  I too have a bit of lingering neuropathy in my fingertips since chemo ended but honestly, I don't think it is as bad as right after my last treatment.  It would be great if it will go away that quickly.  Hope so for all the Sept. ladies too. Also forgot to add that my hair is back to a short hug to my head texture.  It's soft and pretty much white.  It seems to be coming in steady and more of it all the time.  Hugs, Juanita ",

I too have the sharp pains in the breast and also Tori's experience that I think the radiated breast is smaller now.   Is that possible and does it ever plump back up?  I wasn't told this by the Dr.'s but wouldn't have had a choice on radiation anyway since mine was a lumpectomy/partial mastectomy (the term my surgeon uses).  Also another thing is happening that is pretty personal but I've no one else to ask before I see the Dr again in 2 weeks.  Sometimes the breast will have a sensation of drawing up tight and tingle, then the nipple will become erect.  That is so weird!!!  Has anyone else experienced this?  Really, you don't want that happening just anywhere!!!  Hugs, Juanita",

April 6th.  Did I tell you all or you can see it in my diagnosis, that I am Triple Negative?  This scares me but I refuse to let it take over my life.  My Oncologist tells me I have a 10-15 % higher chance of a recurrence then hormone positive breast cancers.  He says since my tumor was Stage I and no lymph involvement that re balances things in my favor a bit.  Still, I'm scared.  I had a friend die in November after just a 2 year battle with Triple Negative.  Have a great day and congrats to those that have finished.

I have 5 more boosts then I am done.  This Friday the 15th is my last treatment!  On Sunday the 17th our kids are having a 40th Anniversary Open House for us at our church.  I bought new clothes and shoes for Hubby and me.  I am so looking forward to it but not sure what I will do with my hair but probably will spike it.  It is about normal length (I always wore it short) on the sides and back but in front, the bangs area, it looks like a man's as it is so short. As for how I'm doing, the nickel size blister is healing and peeling.  No more blisters but some areas of suspicion and I am burned so bad.  Sore, hurting, pain in the breast off and on, other odd sensations, up in the night for lotion so it will cool the burn down, and just generally feeling miserable.  You should see my frown in the mirror when I put the lotion on.  It's Academy Award worthy!!  But, I can do this, I WILL DO THIS.  I'm Triple Negative so I am determined to get all the treatments I can and got through every single chemo treatment so I am doing this too!!!

I had another planning CT Scan yesterday and today will be radiation tx number 20 of 33 total.  I'm getting there.  I have to use a steroid cream in the crease under the breast as it is red and itching.  So far the skin is not broken there but just red.  Amyjo, hugs girl.  You are almost done.  I'm praying for good news on that bone scan.  My Dad had colon cancer in 2004, had surgery and has been fine since.  At that time they found a node on his lungs.  He has an xray every year and it never changes.  His Oncologist said in August if there is no change in that node and because it has been 7 years since the colon cancer and the node on the lung, that he will release him and diagnose him cancer free.  I've heard the same stories with something showing up on the bone that it turns out to be nothing.  Praying it is this way for you Amyjo! Fatigue is kicking my butt big time.  I went to sleep in my recliner last night at 7 p.m., slept until my husband got me up at 10 p.m. and went to bed and slept until 5:30 this morning.  I need to rest more during the day but with that daily radiation schedule it's hard to.  Hubby's taking me out to eat tonight after my rads tx.  Think we will do a BBQ place.  My only other problem right now is a \"friend\" who is stressing me out big time.  She is self centered and always about herself and she is badgering me because I don't feel up to letting her come for a visit (she always expects to be catered to, waited on hand and foot and taken out and wined and dined).  She knows I have breast cancer, have been through chemo and am now in radiation but that isn't a priority for her.  Her priority is what she wants when she wants it.  My husband is livid about her and wants me to ignore her. Have a great weekend everyone.  Thinking of all of you still in treatment and those finished, wishing for a good recovery and a renewed life for you.  It's snowing this a.m. in Illinois but melting as soon as it hits the ground.

Fatigue hit big time over the weekend.  Still having slight issues with neuropathy of the hands/fingers from the chemo that I will be one month since last treatment tomorrow, and toenail issues.  I have my check up tomorrow with my Oncologist and he ordered the tumor marker test CA 27-29 and will have the results.  I'm nervous as I've read there are a lot of false/positives with the CA 27-29 test. It is overcast here today but the birds are singing.  We lost an elderly lady from my church over the weekend.  Ruth was a lovely person, aged 83.  She died suddenly at home, very unexpected.  9 years ago she had breast cancer and had a lumpectomy with radiation and took tamoxifen for 5 years, and has been fine since.  Her death was not due to her breast cancer. I have radiation today and my sister in law is taking me.  I enjoy spending the time with her since we got things worked out between us, she has been super suppportive. I am a little frustrated and wonder what some of you girls would do.  All through chemotherapy, ( remember, it's only a month since my last treatment now) I stayed in, not going anywhere in the public, being so very careful to not pick up anything.  I stayed away from church and anywhere or anyone that I had heard there was sickness.  I even stayed away from my beloved 3 year old grand daughter when she had a cold or a fever.  My sister takes me on Tuesday to radiation and her 1 year old grand daughter has had a fever for 3 days today (why her Mother doesn't take her to the Dr. I don't know!) and she said she is taking Meg with us tomorrow for my radiation!  I told her my husband can take me since Meg is sick and she insists that Meg \"isn't sick that she just has a fever!\"  I don't want to be around this baby.  Am I being unreasonable and over protective of myself or does it make good sense to NOT be around this baby with a fever?  I don't want anything to get me sick and interfere with this radiation schedule.  I can't help if I accidently or unknowingly am around someone sick but if I know it like in this case, I feel I need to take care of myself and do what is right for me.  What do you girls think?  Another thing that irks me is if my sister takes Meg, she will be exposing all the other people there getting radiation to whatever is going on with her grand daughter.  I feel that is being careless!!  One lady that gets radiation before me isn't doing well with treatments and has to be helped by the tech, back to the waiting room daily anyway.  They have to hang on to her.  It is so NOT a place to take a sick baby!  I don't need this stress.

      "Content": "Mar 9, 2011 11:25AM - edited Mar 9, 2011 11:35AM by Jwatrlily Heather (((HUGS))).  Congrats to ladies finishing rads.  Things went ok yesterday.  My sister did not take her grand daughter with the fever.  As a matter of fact, as suspected her Mom didn't take her to the Dr but instead took her back to the day care because she hadn't ran a fever overnight.  Whatev, I'm just glad I didn't have to deal with it.  What I hate is there is always so much darned drama with my extended family and they create so much stress for me.  Since I can't delete family I need to figure a way how to channel them and the stress they create.  Sometimes I do put distance between me and them but I can't eliminate them from my life.  Believe me some days I want to.  My DH said the other night he was about ready to sell our farm and move to Zaire, and I'm pretty sure he doesn't even know where that is!!!    He's just really protective of me and tries very hard for me to not have so much stress in my life, except for what he can cause sometimes.      Today is tx # 9 for me.  Saw my Oncologist yesterday and got the results of the CA 27-29 test.  Number was good, at 19 but he told me that didn't mean cancer wasn't still present but for now that and liver enzymes test is what he is watching.  He said CA 27-29 tumor marker test isn't the most reliable but he's ready to jump if anything goes amiss.  My skin is holding up good.  Saw my RO again yesterday too and he said things are going good but he expects some pink skin by end of the day Friday.  I hope I can get through this will little to no skin reaction.  He has me using Eucerin lotion and that's all he wants me using right now with also bathing with Caress soap. Have a great midweek everyone.  Hugs to you all Juanita",

Have a great Sunday everyone. Juanita",
