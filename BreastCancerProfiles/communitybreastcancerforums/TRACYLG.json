My maternal grandmother and one of her sisters had breast cancer, the other one ovarian. My mom passed from lung cancer 20 years ago. I am actually BRCA negative (tested because of family history + Ashkenazi Jewish heritage), and my sister is BRCA negative, but my aunt and cousin were both positive. Even though theoretically I am back in the regular pool statistically since I am BRCA negative, my gyno is still treating me as high risk given the family history. I know I worry too much, and hopefully this is nothing, but I have also read of people with the exact same symptoms who ended up being positive for some sort of BC. My itching has actually subsided over the past month or so, so now I am thinking I am making too big of a deal about it, but I also feel like you can never be too careful...",

Dr gave me a steroid cream which has helped off and on, but I have also noticed that my left nipple has changed and now looks different than my right one. It is flatter (not inverted) and there is a rough patch on part of the areola as well, and there is halo like ring around the nipple on the areola. My last exam was 6 months ago and my gyno told me it isn't Paget's. I don't think my nipple was as flat at that time, and feel like it has changed since I saw him. I am going for my annual 3D mammogram in a few weeks, and I feel like I am just worrying too much, but I have a huge family history. I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and if your nipple inverted, over what period of time did that occur? Also, just a note that my gynecologist is also an oncologist and has followed me closely because of my family history. Thanks so much. Log in to post a reply",

I had both a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound, and there were no findings. The radiologist did examine me and can feel a rough/thickened patch of skin on my areola, so I'm not crazy. She briefly explained about Paget's and suggested that I could follow up with my dermatologist if I wanted. But she left it up to me, she definitely didn't seem too concerned. I don't know if I am overreacting and should just let this go, or if I should go back to the dermatologist. My symptoms are intermittent itching (some days I have none) on one section of the areola and nipple, and a slightly rough/thicker patch of skin on the areola. Sometimes the nipple is a darker shade of red than my other one, but not always. I have tried two different creams from the dermatologist and they seem to work somewhat, but then the symptoms come back when I stop using them. I feel like I am making all of this up in my head. Has anyone been diagnosed with Paget's without a red, crusty, angry lesion? Thank you!",

So I finally went back to the dermatologist and she wants to do a biopsy based on the fact that this itching has been going on for over a year and my family history of BC. She told me that there would be a scar, do you know how bad that would be? I feel like I have no other choice but to do it, but now I am scared. She told me that with Paget's, there is often an underlying BC that is often undetected on ultrasound and mammogram.",
