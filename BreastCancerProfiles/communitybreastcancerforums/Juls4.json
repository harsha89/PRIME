My lymph node turned out to be nothing (there are so many things that can cause lymph nodes to enlarge). If you had an advanced cancer, there would probaby many suspicious lymph nodes so just one sounds like it's probably early stage. I've finished treatment with a greater than 90% chance (likely greater than 95% according to my oncologist) that the cancer has been totally eradicated. My cancer was considered aggressive so even if you hear words like that or they say \"Grade 3\", it's still not a death sentence, they're just words that help the doctors understand the cancer. When I was diagnosed I thought my life was over too. It's not. You have an extremely treatable cancer. I was shocked to hear my doctors using the phrase \"curable cancer\" for me because I thought cancer could never be cured, that you could only ever be in remission. I also had the exact fears as you. Every time I coughed I thought cancer was in my lungs, every ache had to be cancer. So much of that is just stress. I've been through chemo and I feel just as healthy as I did a year ago. It's awful how long the testing takes, I don't think it's truly understood by medical professionals how stressful the waiting is. To them, they think a few days or weeks doesn't change the diagnosis much, but to us it's complete hell. I know you want the cancer out YESTERDAY, but the week you have to wait will not change your prognosis. I was told repeatedly by doctors that it takes months for early stage cancer to go from one stage to the next and they see no difference in survival, even if treatment is delayed by a month or 2.",

I would talk to your doctor about how soon you will begin treatment and see if you can get the work done beforehand. It's true they don't like you to have procedures or even cleanings done during chemo, and if you're going to be in a lot of pain from the teeth issues, it's probably better to get it out of the way asap.",

I have the BRCA 2 mutation (which I found out about after being diagnosed with breast cancer). I finished treatment but I'm still at a high risk of developing a second cancer so I get a mammagram and breast MRI every year and have ultrasounds to check for cysts on my ovaries. Depending on how worried you are, you may want to consider a unilateral or bilateral mastectomy to reduce your risk of develping breast cancer. Maybe your insurance would cover it and/or reconstruction since you have the BRCA mutation? That reduces your breast cancer risk to almost zero. You also could freeze eggs and then have your ovaries removed to reduce your risk of ovarian cancer, but that will mean you go into menopause which could affect your sex drive, cause hot flashes, etc. For the record, you can get pregnant through IVF even if your ovaries are removed and you're in menopause. You have plenty of time to find a NEW love of your life. I would suggest getting out and volunteering or joining any meetup groups near you to meet new people and keep your spirits up. Coping with loss is really tough, and I've found sharing as much as I can with people in my life has been most helpful. That's why I suggest making an effort to make new, meaningful friendships. There's nothing like having someone who you can be totally honest with and who can handle your baggage. It doesn't have to be a husband. I have a great husband, but I have also become really close with several friends since being my cancer diagnosis. When you share your baggage, often other people will share theirs and it becomes mutually beneficial. When you can, try to be thankful for what you still have instead of focusing on what you lost. You have an opportunity to be really supportive to your sister while she battles cancer, and you can educate your daughter about cancer so that can be proactive about screening when she grows up. Maybe you could consider fostering or adopting a child? Or volunteering with children in some way. Feeling good myself went a long way toward helping me cope.",

They can often rule out cancer by mammagrams and ultrasounds, but sometimes they can't tell what it is and you need the biopsys. So you've had 2 ultrasounds and they're asking to do one more? That seems really bizarre. I would think it would be easier and cheaper to just do the biopsy and at this point, you probably don't have a lot of faith in them. I would call the office and let them know you're upset and ask that someone who has read the results talk to you and explain it better. If they can't give you a good explanation for the cancellations and callbacks, then be persistent about demanding a better answer, having a biopsy, or moving the ultrasound to a sooner date. They should understand that this whole process is very stressful for women and they shouldn't be changing the answers they give you. If all else fails, maybe see if you can have your records transferred to a different office and ask for a 2nd opinion?",

That might just mean that he/she recogognized that you have dense breasts and wants to be certain they didn't miss anything. I finished treatment for breast cancer but because I have the BRCA mutation, I have a high chance of developing a second cancer (independant of the first cancer). The screening for that is a mammagram every 6 months and a breast MRI every 6 months. The MRI is just more thorough. Sounds like you have a doctor and radiologist who are diligent and taking your family history seriously. That's a good thing. No big deal if it's nothing, and if they find cancer then you almost certainly caught it really early.",
