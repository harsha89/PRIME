I had another mammogram a couple of weeks ago and the results were heterogeneously dense. It took several days for my previous mammogram results to be sent to the radiology dept. where I had my current mammogram. (Of course!) the radiologist who read my mammogram is on vacation until Tuesday and no one else can look at the films but that radiologist. My doctor received the first report and said additional testing needs to be done, but I don't know what or when that will be. My mom and her sister have both had breast cancer so I'm a little worried. Any advice? Thanks. Log in to post a reply",
