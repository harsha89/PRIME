As of 2/2013, tumor markers are high, but stable. At onc appt this week, Dr. indicated cytotoxic chemo will be next when Afinitor no longer \"holds the line\" or if mom can't tolerate the SEs. Aftre Afinitor, are other options besides chemo?  I thought I read on previous posts that some Oncs prescribe AIs again after Afinitor.  Now I can't find this particular thread.  What has been other's experience with treatment options after AIs then Afinitor?   Appreciate any insight!  Thanks!
