I had an abnormal mammo a couple of weeks ago and had to do a repeat mammo and U/S. I have an appt. with a surgeon this Thurs. for a biopsy. The hardest part for me was and still is the waiting process and the fact that I lost a sister from BC made it tougher.  It was difficult to concentrate and sleep, but I've managed to somewhat relax thru the support of friends, family and the ladies here. I, too, will keep you in my thoughts and prayers.",
