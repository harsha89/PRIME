I was shocked when I took the dressings off the second time as I had staples instead of stitiches, but they removed fine, no pain. After the second op I was told the margins were still not clear, so I was told I could have another lumpectomy or mastectomy. I could not face another op to be told that the margins were not clear. So I had a masectomy and a reconstruction from my tummy 8th February. I was told after there was no more cancer in the site they removed, but if I had a lumpectomy I think I would have always worried will it come back, plus the breast was already quite deformed from 2 ops. i think I made the right decision, My tummy scar is just taking a bit of time to heal fully. Hope this info helps. ",
