I want to ask the right questions.  My very crude internet research leads me to believe that something's that's high grade(don't really know what that means), with necrosis, has more of a tendency to spread.  The area is about 2 cm.  Any words of advice or experience with a similar diagnosis?  Thanks.  Log in to post a reply",
