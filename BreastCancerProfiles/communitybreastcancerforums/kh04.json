The day of chemo and day after wasnt so bad, I took the steroid doctor prescribed, took claritin once a day after the nulasta(boost wbc) shot. This morning I felt nausea and cold sweat and I ate some crackers and had some water, made me feel better after that. I think I lost some sense of smell and taste, but I do have a big appetite, always feel hungry. (Is it normal?) I try to eat healthy during treatment So it wont cause too much trouble. My mo said I can take calciums, multivitamin and vitamin d supplement. Im looking to get some magnesium to help too. Im putting some cooked gingers in my diet to prevent getting diarrhea. Infusion nurse told me perjeta will cause diarrhea, I want to stay away from it.",

Im going my 2nd tchp this Wednesday and feel kind of overwhelmed right now. Very tired since last Thursday(dry and sore eyes) I did went out over the weekend with the kids and hubby for couple hours each day,maybe that worn me down.(school's out so the kids with me during the day, kind of stressful sometimes, but mostly they helped me) are those tired feelings normal? I was feeling very good on the second week and the 3rd week should even better(or the same) as expected, even after an hour nap the fatigue seems doesn't go away and feeling dont want to do anything in the house.(which is not good). Anyone has similar situation like this?",

Suggest you put some numbering cream(nurse recommended a quarter sized cream to apply and cover it with some plastic bag/food wrapping paper). I think I just applied a pea sized cream and trying to rubbing them into my skin so I guess it didnt work! Next time I will put a chunk.",

I am under age 40 , when I had my first chemo 1 week later I got a full cycle of my period which is 7 days. today I felt Like cramps around in my pelvis area and the couple spots blood couple times a day when wiping off in bathroom. i think the period will come today or tomorrow. I am receiving Lupron shots which I request my mo give to me to prevent permanent menopause. I am her2 positive only BC. my mo said it might not work. I researched later that Lupron shots given to women who are er/ PR positive BC to protect their ovaries. is there anyone can help me figure it out what I should do? I don't mind getting period Every 3 weeks during treatment as long the chemo drugs don't put me on menopause. does the Lupron shots will mess up with my period? I am so confused of what's going on? should I stop the Lupron shots? my bottom line is I don't mind the lupron shots work or not, I just don't want to add unnecessary drug load to affect any future outcomes) any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",

No matter how good the product is, it still has chemicals in there and our body is very sensitive right now, you dont know how your body is going to respond to that chemical thing. Hi ladies, today is my day 9 of first tchp. Day3-6was tired but dorable. Start day 7 had a bad lower back pain and hours later I got my period(my normal period just finished last week) same day I had couple mild D each day until today. It doesnt bother me that much but sometimes just feared of unknown SE and how to handle it better. For energy wise I feel better 1 week after chemo. Same mouth feelings like daylilys. Hope everyone feel better each day! I will pick up my wig and hat tomorrow. feel wired about that but I know I need them.",

I had my 2nd tchp 1 week ago and do feel fatigue in general than the 1 round. I feel very tired on Friday night so I slept from 8pm to 8am Saturday morning, then the whole Saturday I felt weak and do not want to do anything. I realized that I overslept and weakened my body circulation and function. So started sunday I only take around 1 hour nap(as usual days), as long finished house work and taking care of my kids, I will go out enjoying my walk, my heels to upper legs are feel more tired than round 1, but after walk(at least 30minutes), I felt so good. I try to walk 2 times a day for total of 1 hour. I told my self if I can get up take care my self, and I have to go out walk. For energy wise, I took liquid based vitamin and minerals to boost my energy and support my immune system. My mo said it's ok to take supplements so I did double doze everyday. I took enzymes and aloe juice(no sugar added) to help my digestive system(so far I do not have any heart burns, hope never happens). I took high quality co q10 to support my heart since I have herceptin in the regimen. So far the big issue for me is the diarrhea thing(but it's manageable), besides the steroid pill my mo prescribed Before and after chemo and clariton I didnt take any other pills. I do have more nausea feelings than the round 1 but I try to eat every couple hours even I dont feel like it and trying to keep the normal life routine to distract any se. Hope everyone feel better each day!",
