You just work it into your hair as a lather, then towel dry. It worked really well, and my hair didn't feel all icky. There are several websites where you can get it - if you can't find it on a google search, PM me and I'll send you a link. If you can shower, here's a tip someone gave me that worked great for me, anyway. If you have any old lanyards (you know, those things you hang nametags from) from conferences or work, clip the drains to the end and wear the lanyard around your neck. It frees up your hands and then you don't have to worry about the drains dangling down and pulling. Best to you! Su",

I've had several moments, which at the time seemed like odd moments, where I just felt as if I was going to cry right then. And then I feel guilty for being such a baby when so many people have it so much harder than me...but that doesn't change the fact that your emotions are just raw when you're going through this. I'm positive we're not the only ones who have done that!  My surgeons used surgical glue both times - when I had the lumpectomy and when I had the bilat. It's hideous looking, but remember it's just silicone glue, and will peel off within a few weeks. Don't peel it before then, though, 'cause the silicone seals the site and helps the scar heal nice and flat. The one they did on my lumpectomy a month ago is already a fairly neat, flat scar.  Sorry about your bruising - I've had the same problem with mine since the SNB. Apparently the veins in my only usable arm now (my right) tend to roll. Nice. I came out of the hospital with all manner of bruises on that side.  THey took a lot more tissue from me than I expected, too - reduced my left side by a whole cup size. When I went to NOLA for my bilat/diep, Dr. S said it looked as if I'd had a partial mastectomy, not a lumpectomy. Just be careful and watch it for signs of filling with fluid - take it easy - I had a seroma build up, and two weeks after the lumpectomy, all the fluid leaked out all over my bed and pajamas in the middle of the night. Sorta freaked me out! Hugs Su",

(As long as I'm not looking, I'm usually fine.) But when I mentioned this (jokingly) to my surgeon, he very seriously offered to let me be sedated when they did this. Could you possibly talk to your surgeon and find out if this is an option for you? Could they at least give you something for the anxiety this clearly causes you? Is there someone who would be willing to be with you? They did offer to let my DH be with me if I wanted him there. (I opted to let him wait outside...I figured it would be harder on him than me. He hates seeing me hurt!)  I got through my procedure just fine. I went in the morning - around eight - and they inserted the needle (I didn't look!) then did the injection of dye for the lymph node thing. I went into surgery about eleven that morning. I was done with surgery, awake, and home by 3:30 that afternoon, and only needed pain meds the first two nights. Other than a little residual soreness, I've been fine since then with no pain meds at all! I'm even back to driving now. I get my staples out tomorrow. I promise - it really isn't so bad! I'll be praying for you - please take care of yourself! Hugs Su",

I love having them done. (It's also practical for me to use gel nails, because I work at my computer, and without them, my nails constantly split and peel.)  Anyway, I asked the surgeons at NOLA when I was having my consult, and they said on my fingers, acrylic nails were fine as long as I had clear polish so they could see my nail beds. (Apparently that's something they watch for with oxygen levels or something - your nail beds turn blue if your oxygen levels drop.) Fine by me, 'cause I do a french manicure anyway. They said it didn't matter on toenail polish, that I could do whatever I wanted there. So paint those little toesies pink, especially if it makes you smile!  We'll be thinking of you! Su",

Apparently, in rare cases, the tissue inside your incision can actually adhere to the tiny little tubes. The medication had worn off, and when the nurse pulled the tubes to remove them, the searing pain nearly made me pass out. I swear, if I'd been able to get a breath, I'd have used every one of George Carlin's seven dirty words you can't say on television. It felt as if my incision was being ripped out from the inside. Thank GOD it passed quickly, but it took me a few minutes to get my breath back. She seemed rather shocked that it hurt - and I'm NOT a wuss when it comes to pain - and assured me that this kind of thing was extremely rare. Even after that, I'd have it again - because the pain relief it delivered post op was worth it! I'd just ask them to remove it before the novacain wears off this time! Su",

They couldn't really see them on the mammo because I have dense breast tissue. They biopsied both. One turned out to be nothing but a fibroid, which pretty much collapsed when he stuck it with the biopsy needle. The other - the smaller of the two - did turn out to be a teeny 4mm area of lobular carcinoma. The good news is that had they not found this on US, it would've been at least 3-5 years before I'd have felt the lump, according to the doctor. It was found extremely early and is still very small. I had it removed last Friday, along with a sentinel node biopsy to make sure it hasn't spread. Still waiting for the results of the labwork, and trying not to bite my nails... But keep in mind, MOST biopsied \"lumps\" turn out to be nothing to worry about. Just because an area looks dark on US doesn't mean it's cancer. One of my friends has had five biopsies, and every one was nothing but a harmless fibroid. The fact that they were willing to biopsy this and make sure tells you how vigilant your doctors are - they're not taking any chances with your health! It's always better to know than not to. Knowledge is power, and the earlier you catch anything, the better your chances of kicking its butt!  It's so hard not to worry...I know...but remember the women on this forum are here for you. When you get your results, please come back and let us know. PM me if you can...we'll dance if it's good news, and if it's not so good, we'll be here to hold your hand all the way through it. I got my dx in April, and have been coming here for about a month since I discovered it - and they have been so incredible. I don't know what I'd do without them! Hugs to you! Su",
