I am going to submit a claim to medicare to see if they will partially reimburse me.They pay 42$ on a compression bra. I have gotten so much conflicting info about compression bras, I feel like more of an expert than my therapists. My therapist keeps telling me how much better it is and I am putting my trust in her about this! I am still walking my 2 miles/day and have done some work in the garden but have to limit it due to the heat .Wish I could show you all a picture of my flower garden.

I , like Minus2, have not had it in the arm and am super careful to follow all the advice I have read to avoid it! I am glad Minus sent the link for step up, because I have found it VERY helpful. When you click on the section about garments, there are links to several forums from this website that have good info about bras to look into. I purchased the Belisse from the Company Lymphedema Products ( $175) and it is the most comfortable one I have gotten and I think, the most effective. I have also purchased others from our local retailer who specializes in compression garments for those with breast Ca. and luckily, medicare covers $42 for each bra up to 6 per year. I have 2 Jodee bras trhat are more like a regular bra that I wear when I want a less \"clunky fit \" under my clothes and I just bought an Amoena bra ( model name Patricia) which is also pretty comfortable. Check with your insurance about coverage. I saw a Norton trained (and studying for the LANA cert. ) LE therapist at my cancer center all summer, twice a week and then once a week for the last month. She also taught me the manual drainage exercises which I do faithfully twice a day .I also have swell spots or some call them chip pads and a full breast pad that I worn a lot when I first started to break up all the fibrotic tissue in my breast. It also helps the lymph fluid move and I still wear the small one every few days because the LE breast is still a little bigger than it should be. I wear a compression bra 24/7 ( except for the shower -LOL) My therapist also suggested a good sports bra but I haven't found any that fit comfortably . I also do arm and shoulder exercises daily but this is due to a torn rotator cuff but I figure they should also be good for LE. I walk 2 miles a day also do diaphramatic breathing in a set of 10 several times a day. My therapist said she didn't recommend preventive compression sleeves for flying but I will do more research on this if I plan on any flights in the near future. I do hope you are seeing an LE therapist Good luck. ",

If you have lymphedema, I think it needs to be evaluated by a certified LE therapist .You can be taught do do self exercises to form new lymph pathways and the therapist should be doing extensive massage to keep the LE from progressing. I had twice weekly sessions all last summer and now do my manual drainage exercises 2x day as well as arm exercises and daily 2 mile walk as well as wearing a compression bra 24/7.

The tech then said they would check the xrays and make sure all was correct before doing the boost. She came back and FINALLY took the time to explain that they would be hitting the tumor site from both sides and then proceeded to mark the area all around the incision. I have my appointments at lunchtime so I get new people and I am a worrier anyway so this really upset me. I will be VERY GLAD to be done with this .! Monday will be my last day. I will get to do a survey online afterwards and boy, do I have some suggestions! Hope you all have a good week .",

They lined me up as usual but the machine did not start the usual clicks and buzzes etc so when they came back in to the room I said \" something different today? Then they said they were doing xrays to make sure i was lined up correctly and would do them weekly. I wish they had said something before they started as it made me nervous not knowing what was going on, only that it was not the usual procedure! I am glad I got tattoos because that is what they mainly use to get lined up rather than the marks. I asked my tech about the marks as most of them had worn off but she said they take a picture of them the first time so that is always in the chart for reference and so I assume they know what they are doing!! My appointments are usually late like many of you, but I asked the tech about this and she was quite apologetic, saying if the chemo patients are late, it puts them behind as well. So since I can't change it, I just try to go with the flow and bring a book to read. I had #10 of / 20 today with not too much side effect other than redness and some soreness & itching . And it does fade almost back to nomal on the weekend so I assume it will eventually go back to normal after all TX is finished. I've been going mainly braless, but did get some crop tops by Bali called \"comfort revolution\" ( found them on clearance rack.at Kohls ) which are soft with no side seam and provide just a little support to keep my boobs from jiggling when I'm out in public METOO- I can't believe that your treatment team didn't tell you they were changing the plan. That's really lame! Glad you will still get to go on your trip. As you say, others have a much harder time and like you, I don't need Chemo and am grateful for that. Beaver- I am having no fatigue so far and walk 1.5 mi a day and am eating protein snacks several xs a day as the nurse recommended . Hope you all have a good week.",

The only issue I am having after # tx9 is some stinging under my arm and itching and still can't sleep on the affected side so sleep is not as restful as usual. maybe that explains my ocasional irritability! About 3 weeks post op, I developed a very red and warm to touch area in most of my lower breast. The Surgeons PA said it was probably serous fluid that leaked under the skin and was pulled dowm by gravity. But she gave me an antibiotic. Took them and it almost was back to normal when I started rads, The RO had seen the redness at my Sim and said it would'nt interefere with tx. Well, the first day it got very red again and he just shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't know why but didn't want to rx more meds. So , I have stopped worrying about it. It does get red now after each tx but seems to fade some in the evening .So maybe this is the new normal! I am walking at least a mile /day and so far, don't feel fatigue. I am looking forward to a sunny Sat . so I can work in my garden ! Happy Easter to those who celebrate it and Happy weekend to the rest !",

Luckily, my MO's NP dx and we caught it early. It is already much better . PS Greeek yogurt is also high protein which I ate with fresh blueberries or strawberries in it and still do!",

He did actually look at my breast this time and assured me that what he saw was expected ( still tanned, swollen, aereola looks dusky and skin feels thick. with a few little dark spots) he said it should get even better in the next 4-6 weeks. I did ask about increased soreness and numbness in the axillary area but he said that was from surgery, not radiation because of all the nerves that were cut and eventually that should resolve. He pronounced me \"in remission\" and then asked me if he could pray with me!!!! That is a first in all my years of seeing doctors and I think it was inappropriate but I said OK ( i figured it can't hurt, might help) . Maybe he figured since I am an old white woman living in the bible belt, I was religious -NOT ! I have to admit I was in a crummy mood because I have 2 very sick dogs and was on the verge of tears when he asked what my summer plans were and I mentioned this to him as we have no plans other than to recarpet the house when they are gone. I sometimes wish and envy people who do have a strong faith but i just don't. Anyway, I don't have to see him again and I do hope he knew what he was doing when he devised the radiation therapy plan for me!!! BTW. I also have a hard area under my incision but I was told to expect that so haven't worried about it. Hope you all have a nice Memorial Day holiday .",

I made a post earlier this week about the process so won't go over it again, but the techs explained they were hitting the bed from both sides so I'd rather they target more than less. At my post op surgery visit, the surgeon set me up with both the MO and RO and I saw them the next week. The center has electronic records so all my notes are available to all providers. As to billing, I have medicare and a supplement ( thank heavens) and so far since January, the $ paid by the supplement is more than my yearly premium. At least that's one thing i don't have to worry about. Congrats bevearntx on finishing! I have only 2 to go. Veered, the updates on your progress regarding skin reactions are helpful to me because i have some of the same issues. I also have little acne like bumps but breakdown and lots of redness.
