I kept telling myself that they couldn't tell if it was cancer from a mammogram, but the radiologist just said, \"If you were a member of my family, I would tell you to go see your surgeon.\" (MY surgeon? Does everyone have a surgeon but me?) Yes, it did turn out to be cancer, but they caught it so very early. I thank God for that radiologist's good eyes and her good advice. And yes, I went through the lumpectomy, chemo and radiation, but the last two were more cautionary than anything else. debiann is correct -- wait until you have all the facts before get worked up. Until you hear otherwise, you are healthy. Get the facts...all of the facts...about your situation, then take it one step at a time.",
