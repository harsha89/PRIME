Is it necessary that the MRI be done with contrast? An MRI on its own has little to no radiation so that wouldn't be an issue but I do understand what you're saying about he contrast. Also, a mammo is not completely contraindicated during pregnancy since you're out of first tri and if they use a shield. It's hard when you feel like you aren't getting clear answers. I would seek another opinion of you don't feel comfortable. Best of luck and keep us updated !",

From what I have read, that rating is not very common as there is too much uncertainty with it. It may be worth asking about lesion and why it was rated as such if you would feel more comfortable. For me, I was explained that my lesion was a birads 4 because it was hypoechoic (meaning solid) and lobulated. With that being said, if the doctor is willing and decided to schedule a biopsy then I wouldn't consider it unnecessary. The risk of complications is very low. Also, you will have a much better idea of what's going on. Like I said before , a lot of radiologists don't use this rating (birads3)as much due to the fact that it falls right in between benign (birads 2) and suspicious for malignancy (birads 4). I think many like to err on the side of caution. Hang in there and take care. I know this process is long and tough but hopefully you'll find the answers you are looking for!",

If it were me and my radiologist had recommended a 6 month follow up then that is what I would have done. But I can't say how I would have felt with anxiety and such because I do like having answers and knowing for sure. Ultimately, no one can tell you what to do or what it is best. Of course, your doctor is your best resource but maybe you would feel more comfortable if you got a second opinion confirming that the area looks benign? I'm an RN also so I can totally relate to how you feel. We always have to consider/ be prepared for the worst since it's an important part of what we do. In the end, you just have to do what makes you feel most comfortable. It is your body and your health and as long as the physician agrees that biopsy is acceptable then I wouldn't worry about it.",

I am currently pregnant and I just had two awful weeks of waiting for testing and biopsy results on a birads 4. Mine was also hypoechoic and ended up being a a fibroadenoma. They are fairly common in younger women. I do not know of anyone in my family who had one before me. It is truly hard to tell for certain by ultrasound or mammo if it is a fibroadenoma, as they are also solid breast tumors and share characteristics of other conditions. There is nothing wrong with wanting certainty! It is your body and your health. I am glad to hear you are pushing for the answers you deserve. Find a good breast center if you can. Not all doctors are created equally so find one that you feel comfortable with. Please take care and keep us posted! ",

      "Content": "Simms8212 wrote: Hi everyone. I'm 25 years old and I'm currently 13 weeks pregnant with my second little girl. I did IVF to conceive this time around. While I was waiting to find out if the IVF worked I found a small lump in my left breast. It felt to be about the size of a pea, well defined, deep in the breast, hard/rubbery, and only slightly mobile. I had a sinking feeling right away because the lump didn't feel obviously benign to me as an RN. Fast forward to my 12th week of pregnancy where I had my OB try to feel the lump. She couldn't find it without my help and said she would have missed had I not pointed it out. She scheduled me for an ultrasound, which was last Wednesday. The tech at the breast center had a hard time finding it as well and had the radiologist come in the watch to be sure that there was even something there. Turns out that there is 1.2 cm hypoechoic lobulated region, which is bigger than I expected. The radiologist said it didn't look \"overly suspicious\". He ultimately decided on doing a biopsy because he said with me being pregnant it was more likely to change in the coming months and it would make sense to just be sure and not worry down the road. He also said if we didn't biopsy we'd have to follow up every3-6 months. He really didn't seem all that worried though. I felt pretty confidant that things would be ok until my OB called me that night saying that she'd received the report of a BI-RADS 4 suspicious mass. She made sure I had my biopsy scheduled. So for the past few days I've basically done all the research I can on breast cancer during pregnancy. I'm kind of a paranoid person so I already feel somewhat convinced that it will be cancer. I've just been feeling so scared in anxious to the point that I'm sick. My biopsy will be tomorrow and can take anywhere from 24 hours to 7 days for results which is basically like torture! Just looking for any support/advice on how to make it through these next few days. Or anyone else going through a similar thing? Log in to post a reply",

Your story definitely helps reassure me that things can be ok after diagnosis. I'm sorry that you've found yourself waiting on more biopsy results and I have my fingers crossed for a good outcome for you as well. Still no results for me but I'm hoping to find out Monday.",

I will start by saying that an ultrasound tech is not the person who will diagnose you nor read and interpret your ultrasound result. Please do not expect them to be able to tell you about the findings or what is causing your trouble since that is not their job. So I would try not to take to much offense to her not being able to give you an answer. It is just not within her scope of practice. There are many things that could be causing your symptoms. I would certainly follow up with an MRI if you and your physician feel it necessary. If you are having pain and feel a lump then you deserve the answers you are looking for but just try your best to be patient with the process. As a healthcare worker, I know how it goes behind the scenes and understand that it can take some time. Diagnosis is rarely is single step process. Hang in there. FX that you get it figured out.",
