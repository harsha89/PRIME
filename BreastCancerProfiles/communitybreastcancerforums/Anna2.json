It is Feb. 2010, and my hair is about 2 and 1/2 inches long. It has come back thicker, very, very curly (pretty curls, not frizz) and much darker than it was. No gray, all dark brown, but I never had gray before. My hair was stick straight and blonde before. I like my new hair. Before that, I had three different wigs I wore, and then a lot of scarves. I was glad when my head was covered with hair so I could go without!",

You may enjoy the straight look. Everyone wanted to guess how my hair was going to come back. They all wanted to touch it. It amazing how much emphasis is put on hair, isn't it? Lots of luck!",

I have just finished my treatment and the port is out, but I realize that  I will have to fight for the rest of my life so it won't come back. I, too, had HER2+and the doctor said there is a 35% chance it will come back. Is that what you were told? I had two surgeries, lymph node involvement, chemotherapy, Herceptin, radiation, and now, am on Arimidex for five years. I am 53.",
