In Jan I had a bi lat mast. My reasons for this was my family history 4 women have had bc an passed away from it. I had to give my self a lil more peace of mind! I would worry about it \"coming back\" in the other breast so I said you know what just take them both an when im done with rads I will get reconstruction an I get to pick which size I want! I had a bi lat mast on 23 Jan 08 I had more pain to me wit my lumpec than my mast. My doctors thought it would be better for me to have rads as well.....  You can always get a second opinion or do some research on lumpect vs mast. this site has help a lot with information on that. Just remember do whats best for you an not what the surgeons think!",
