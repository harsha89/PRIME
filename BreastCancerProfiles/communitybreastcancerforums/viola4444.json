I didn't experience a any pain but I know it can differ from woman to woman. The US was completely fine, you lie down and they smear some gel over your breasts and then glide a blunt pen like device over the area they want to investigate. I was told there and then the results - I had cysts - which were then drained. I have to got tomorrow for another mammogram and US, just hoping that it's something as easy to treat as cysts again...fingers crossed.",

It didn't hurt for me so I hope it will be the same for you. Yes, carpediem, I remember seeing mine on the screen last year and being beside myself as to what the white circles meant!",
