I wish I had know it can come back as mets years and years later ( 16 years in my case) I would have insisted on scans etc in the years after treatment finished. I wish when I was diagnosed with bone mets my GP had given me some hope. I felt I needed to go home and \u201cget my affairs in order\u201d when here I am 4 and half years later",

I went into an immediate menopause and the hot flushes were sooooooo bad. My GP said there was an anti anxiety called Effexor that not only helped with anxiety ( which I had because of the cancer) but also reduced hot flushes. Over the years the menopause symptoms subsided but other life events made me keep with Effexor. Over the years my dosage has fluctuated between 150mg and 37.5mg daily and I have NEVER had any problems with it. I hope it is as successful for you. Best wishes x       ",
