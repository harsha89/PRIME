    "Content": "Pepper44 wrote: I am deciding between 2 surgeons for my lumpectomy. One surgeon plans to use ultrasound during surgery to find the mass and the other would use either a radioactive seed or wire to localize. Does anyone know if there are advantages, disadvantages to the different methods? So far the surgeons seem to indicate just a preference for their approach but not that one is better then the other. Any experiences to share? Thanks! Dx 3/12/2019, IDC, Left, 1cm, Stage IA, Grade 2, 0/4 nodes, ER+/PR+, HER2- Surgery 4/24/2019 Lumpectomy: Left; Lymph node removal: Sentinel Log in to post a reply",
