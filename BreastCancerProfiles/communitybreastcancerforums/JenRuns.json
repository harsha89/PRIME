MSK is one of the best in the country, not just NJ, so you are definitely in good hands! Love the hair photos! Exciting to see it all coming in. Travelhound, I don't really know what to expect with the exchange surgery, other than every says it's easier than the bmx! My expander is under the muscle... PS said it was relatively simple.. go in, and swap out. When we thought he would take out my port (he isn't - MO wants it in until rads is done), he said I would feel more sore from that than the implants!! Starting to do some research on hormone therapy... MO early on said tamoxifen. But I'm seeing stuff that says with ILC and ER+, if I stay pre-menopausal, I should consider at least tamoxifen+ovarian suppression, and maybe even anAI+ovarian suppression. Trying to make an appointment with a gyn-oncologist to see if he has an opinion on it. So much to do/know/ask/consider.",

Given Teese's experience, I brought salty snacks (cashews and cheezits). I had a reaction to the cytoxan, so took a Benadryl when I got home. That made me crash around 10, then I was wide awake at midnight, with a rolling tummy. Nothing awful (not a \"I'm going to puke\" feeling), but lying in bed unable to sleep with that going on was irritating. I took a compazine at midnight (for \"mild nausea\") and when that didn't really help, got some saltines around 1. Finally at 2 I took an Ativan (for \"severe nausea\", nut the nurse said it'll help you sleep.) that did the trick. From now on, if it's at night, I'll take the Ativan straightaway. This morning is fine (so far). Made my usual breakfast (hard boiled egg and toast) and will have a cup of coffee. No plans, so I'll chill and watch some of my movies/shows on my list.",

I'll do 12 weeks of a weekly taxol infusion. Hair: I should clarify... I'm not certain whether I'm being shaved or buzzed. I am going to the wig shop where I bought my wig. The nurses at my MO office love her, so I'm putting my faith in her recommendation. It'll be done Thursday, which is about a week ahead of when I would expect to lose my hair. I've already seen onesie twosies come out. Now I'll be watching for the \"other\" hair. I'm telling you, my left armpit hair can't fall out soon enough, since I can barely reach it to shave with the electric razor!!! Theantz, glad the port worked out how you wanted!! Boy, that's a rough choice... I don't know what I'd offer as advice. I'm doing A/C (which we hear is awful), but honestly, isn't it all awful, really? Anything to increase my odds .... though I wasn't given a choice! I'll be sending thoughts of peace and clarity for you as you consider your options.",

Definitely grateful I grabbed those instead of my full-length, snugger pants ... I wouldn't have been able to get those on at all. Even now, just over 10-days post-op, the fabric makes a huge difference. I wore a stiffer cotton button down the other day and it drove me nuts... just irritated the skin in the center of my chest. Soft is good :) I went home with a surgical bra, which I'm able to pin the drains to. I've worn it every day (washing intermittently of course!)",

The protons don\u2019t go through the port of the TEs, so I had to take them out... my PS, RO and MO all agreed I could do surgery 3 weeks post-chem, then start rads in 2-3 weeks. So, today I had my exchange surgery! Proton therapy uses protons instead of photos in traditional radiation therapy. It\u2019s much more precise, as the beam \u201cstops\u201d at the target and doesn\u2019t go through or scatter. The end result is less radiation damage to the surrounding tissue. It\u2019s good for left-sided breast cancer because it minimizes/eliminates radiation exposure to the heart and lungs. (For the same reasons, exposure to healthy tissue, it\u2019s also used for pediatric cancers, brain tumors, moving organs, etc.) I\u2019m super lucky to work at a health system that just got proton therapy this fall... we are the only center in the state, and one of a few in the Midwest. My RO and PS are excited to see if there is less potential damage to the implant because of the different approach. (For the record, it\u2019s just as effective at zapping cancer cells as photons... just a different type of energy.)   ",

I'll be finishing rads that week (presuming no delays) and it's just too uncertain for us. Spending >$5k on a trip I might not be able to fully enjoy (i'm a \"sit by the pool / in the sun and drink all day\" kinda gal) just isn't worth it. We may look at a trip to Key West in March/April, when I'm more \"normal.\" *sigh* This is the *worst* part of the whole cancer diagnosis (other than the fear of dying, of course). Missing out on the things that were planned before diagnosis, or missing out on the things that I would normally be doing but can't. I hate it.",

Bottom line is that I'll do that procedure, but now I have to wait almost a year after radiation to schedule the first surgery, then it's another 3 months after that for the second one (the \"tweaking\"). That puts me at January 2019 for surgery and spring for the second one. Two full years from diagnosis. So completely and totally bummed out at that. Not to mention the thought of carrying around these expanders for another year. (My \"Tijuana boob job\" as the nurse today phrased it ... that cracked me up.) On the up side, I'll get a tummy tuck.

Felt overwhelmed and on the verge of tears all day. One meltdown at work (privately, thank goodness) and another at home when I saw the bread I wanted with salad was moldy. Seriously felt like a 2-year-old who was irrationa and cranky. *sigh* Spent yesterday evening in the ER, to rule out anything serious with this pain in my chest. No blood clot and not cardiac, so take some Aleve and/or Zantac and call it good. I'm sure that didn't help with the exhaustion today. Hope everyone has a relaxing weekend. It's homecoming dance for my daughter and then dinner with my inlaws for my birthday. Really don't want to do it, but recognize I'm being that cranky 2-year-old :)",

I walked throughout my treatment... 30 minutes a day with longer walks on the weekend. I did the Komen 3-day for the cure during chemo too. My biggest challenge was my heartrate. My PA explained that because my RBC went low, my heart had to work overtime to pump the RBCs through my system. I found that even just walking 3.5 mph would get my heart rate up into the 160s. A slower 3mph walk would have it in the 140s, my normal HR for an easy run. So, you may slow down a bit because of the HR issues or general fatigue. But I found that making my self walk everyday really helped and (I think) made a difference in my overall fatigue. I credit walking with getting me through a really tough time. Best wishes to you as you start this portion of your treatment! Jen",
