I had a Mamo 2 days ago on my left breast but I don't have any results yet. My surgery is scheduled for next Friday the 13th for lump removal and biopsy. I want to be able to tell my doctor that if he gets in there and sees anything suspicious to take the whole breast. Should I tell him to take the other one as well? Are the chances greater of getting breast cancer in the other breast? I'm hoping everything will be fine, but I have three kids so I also think about worst case scenario too. Log in to post a reply",
