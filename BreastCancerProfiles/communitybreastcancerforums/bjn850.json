It began at the entry spot of my mammosite tubing(after rad tx was over and tubing was removed) and extended in an oval shape for a couple of inches It began as just red, irritated skin but eventually had layers of blisters, and itched/burned. This was during my4th chemo tx. My medical oncologist suggested it was Herpes or shingles and said she could order antibiotics if it continued.  It didn't. I hope yours gets cleared up quickly.  We certainly don't need extra stuff like this!",
