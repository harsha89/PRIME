I was one who shed for 6 weeks after chemo but it was even thinning all over. Still have thick curls in regrowth and thrilled they are dark brown . At 61 I expected grey! I am taking generic aarimidex for 20 months now with no hair loss. I also take biotin supplements for hair and nails so that may help. I looked into keratine shampoo but it had phosphates so I passed. Thanks for this discussion thread. Hope all have a peaceful holiday.",
