My mom was DX in June 2011 with stage 2 BC, no nodes involved, 16 rounds of chemo and has been on hormonal therapy ever since. Well, her recent blood tests came back with her calcium elevated to 10.9. She is having a full body scan tomorrow. I am terrified. Just was wondering how high your calcium levels were when diagnosed with bone mets? I know I might be reaching for hope straws here and really everyone is different, but 10.9 doesn't seem THAT high to me . Please enlighten. Me ladies! :)",
