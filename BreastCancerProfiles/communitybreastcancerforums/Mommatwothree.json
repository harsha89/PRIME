Two Saturdays ago my left nipple completely retracted. Gone! Very painful and very deep into itself. I can feel a small lump under my nipple. I immediately called my GYN who sent me for a mammogram (completely clear and I did the 3d! ) ultrasound showed a 1-2 cm mass under he nipple. The radiologist wanted me to see a surgeon prior to biopsy. So i did, and she agreed I need a biopsy to proceed. She did warn me this could be cancer. So I went to toady for the biopsy and the new radiologist said he could other find the lump, yet you can still feel it! He sent me home saying nope, I am fine no cancer see my surgeon in six months! Thankfully my surgeon called me today and has rescheduled my biopsy with the original radiologist who saw it on ultrasound. The BS did say she is still concerned and that it does not look like an infection. I am just freaking out. Dr Google is an evil man and I just need someone to ell me something! My husband and I have not told anyone yet, as we dont know what to say. I looked at pagets disease and I have no other symptoms. The retracted nipple is very painful, and sore, but no sores on the nipple. Any other suggestions? The waiting as you know is miserable. I will not have any answers until my Tuesday BS appt, and that's if hey can do the biopsy Thursday . Anyone have a hiding lump? Thanks for taking the time to read, M Log in to post a reply",
