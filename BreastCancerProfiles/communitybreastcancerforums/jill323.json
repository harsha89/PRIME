(kidding) Anyway, next round is in three weeks and they are going to mix in the Herceptin at that time.  Today was just to find out how I would react to the Taxol.   I was there about 5 hours due to all the premeds (Emend, Aloxi, Benadryl, Tagamet, Decadron) and the like.  You can tell they are doing a lot to \"prevent\" side effects.   Feeling a little weak and fatigued right now, but it is manageable.   Going to go back to bed soon.  Hope all the rest of you that had the chemo party today are also doing well ! Jill P.S. The lidocane cream they gave me for the port worked like a dream despite just getting the darn thing put in this past Monday.   I put the cream right over the steri strips, and it still worked !  Did not even feel it when they accessed it !",

Try the following link to get to the other thread.  Hope it works for you. http://community.breastcancer.org/forum/96/topic/722013?page=2#idx_39 I read your other post as well.  Speaking from my twilight sedation experience, I found it much easier to snap back from that than the general anesthesia from the lumpectomy.   I basically got home and slept for a couple hours and then felt pretty good.  Of course, I am 43 and not 78.   So, not sure my experience would be the same as for your Mom.  However, I know I am a wimp and had no desire to be \"awake\" for them digging around in my chest.   I have a lot of respect for women who can go the local route, but I know my personal limitations on that.     Everything in this experience has a trade off somewhere.  Just have to decide where your Mom's is.  Anyway, the other piece of advice I can give you is that after getting her port, make sure they get you a prescription for the Emla cream (lidocaine).  Not all docs do this or like to have their patients using this prior to port access, but for a wimp like me, it made a huge difference.  Did not even feel that needle going in despite the still tender surgery site - and honestly that was the part I was dreading most (I know, wimp).  Good luck !

As for the flu shot thing.. I specifically asked my onc. about taking a Flu shot and she told me to go ahead and get it, but to make sure I spaced it \"in between\" treatments.  In other words, get it about a week and a half after my treatment (which would be a week and a half before my next one).  Have to admit, this makes me a little twichty, but so does potentially getting the flu while my immune system is compromised.  Folks in my office are dropping like flies now with all kinds of bugs.  Wondering what the lesser of the two evils is at this point.   Because this makes me nervous, I am going to ask her again, specifically asking the \"lesser of two evils\" part of it.    But, I suspect like everything else, they likely advise you based on a lot of factors including age, treatment course, etc.   So, we are probably all better off asking our oncs.

Stage - This is determined by the size of the tumor, the number of lymph nodes involved and whether metasis is present.  Like unique says, stages 0, 1, and 2 are considered \"early\".  Grade - A measure of how \"aggressive\" the tumor is.  They determine this by looking at it under a microscope and looking at how rapidly the cells are dividing, what type of cells they are and how far from \"normal\" the nuclei of the cell look.   Grade 1 is the \"lowest\" (or least aggressive) grade and Grade 3 is the \"highest\" (or most aggressive) grade.     There are others, and I know this is a lot to take in.  But, I hope this was helpful.   Thanks for indulging me on my chemo low.  I now feel like I did something productive.   Jill",

In any case, usually when they find this via microcalcifications, it means it was caught very early.  So, that is relatively good news !   As for the other breast, weirdly, I had the same thing happen.  My right one was the \"offending\" one, but I got super sensitive about the left one.  However, it turned out to be nothing in my case.  I ended up attributing it to stress. However, I am assuming that they will get you a pre-op MRI - and they will get a good look at both breasts when they do that.  So, not to worry !   In any case, I have been where you are now.  Did the lumpectomy and am now in chemo then off to radiation.   In my case, the IDC was little but not very nice (aggressive markers).  However, this is not the case with all IDC.   In fact, my case is a little unusual in that regard.   So, feel free to contact me at any time.  I am nearly expert at reading a pathology report now !  Lots of ladies on the board will support you through this !   I know this is a club you did not want to join (no one does), but once you are here, you are \"family\".

So... a couple of things that helped me when I started this.  1) With the advances in breast cancer treatment even over the past couple years - our prognoses are better than ever.   This might sound a little crass (and forgive me if it does), but when I got this, I thought.. well, if I gotta get cancer, at least I got the \"right\" kind.   What I mean by that is that this type has so much attention and research dollars toward it these days, the survival rates have increased and recurrence risks have dropped dramatically.  There are other types of cancer whose prognosis is a whole lot worse.  Even just five years ago my type of tumor (Her2+++) was considered to be almost guaranteed to come back.  Today, with the advances like herceptin, the chances of it ever coming back have dropped amazingly.  2) My aunt is a 23 year breast cancer survivor.  She was treated at the exact same age I am right now when the technologies were not nearly as advanced.  By God, if she could do it, so can I.  3)  Look at the sheer numbers on this board.   While it is depressing to think about all these ladies (and some men) having breast cancer - the fact they are here says you are not alone.   Many of these women are doing great today and are real life heroines in my eyes.   4) I have seen a number of women on this board start asking the question of \"what did I do wrong\" - as if somehow we did something to cause this.   I have learned over time that you will make yourself crazy doing that.   There is no explanation that you can put your finger on - not HRT, not your crazy lifestyle in your 20s, not your lack of mammograms, etc.   No one did anything to deserve this and to suggest otherwise blames the victim.   So.. start putting your energy toward where you need it - focus on the end game which is kicking this thing.   Some practical suggestions now...  lots of communities have local Wellness Community Centers where you can join a local support group.  I have found them to be a great source of information and comfort.   I really look forward to time I spend with these ladies.   If your town does not have that, check with your doc's office.  They sometimes know of local organizations who do similar things. In order to start turning your energy toward the end game, start thinking about very practical things like...  taking time off of work (if you work) and how you want to go about that (DB, vacation), how or whether you want to inform family members, co-workers etc.  In other words, wait out the waiting game by occupying yourself with other things that will focus your energy toward not letting yourself be a victim of this little monster.  While it might sound cliche, we really do acquire strength in what we overcome.  You are on the start of a journey that none of us wanted to be on.  But, think of it as a journey that has a defined and glorious end point - which is being cancer free.  It will be bumpy and scary at times and your path and milestones are just now being defined.   But, you can do this.   Attitude really is a big enabler.  Now.. hang in there.  I hoped this helped even a little.  We will support you throughout. I look forward to hearing what your breast surgeon says.   Jill",

Sending out for ER/PR and Her2 testing is very typical.  This means they will send out your sample for characterization.   What they will be looking for is estrogen receptors (ER), and progesterone receptors (PR).  Doing this lets them know if female hormones were \"feeding\" your tumor.   Her2/neu is a \"protein\" that characterizes about 20% of tumors (I am Her2 positive).   Having all this characterization will determine your treatment course.  Finally, they are recommending taking a good look at it for Medullary Carcinoma.  This is a more rare type of breast cancer that is characterized by its color.  However, the good news with that is that this type is usually considered to have a better prognosis. So.... what does all this mean ?    It means that they caught this - and this is a good thing (even if they did get it wrong at first).     The breast surgeon will go over your options based on a lot of factors including the expected size of the tumor, the location, etc.    You are likely looking at a lumpectomy or a mastectomy depending on those factors and your personal choices.   (You will also likely be sent for an MRI at some point).    The treatment course after that is determined by a LOT of things - charcteristics of your tumor, the surgery route you chose, your age, your menopausal status.   You will find there is not one size to fit all these days. Just take it one day at a time.  Get as much information as you can and ask as many questions of your doctors as you can to best understand your situation.  That is what they are there for.   While this will be a very bumpy time in your life, there have been lots of us down this path - and are doing pretty well these days.   We understand and can support you.    Also.. remember.. waiting is the hardest part.  Once you get rolling and into treatment, it will be easier to focus and move forward.  So, hang in there - you can do this.   You can also feel free to Private message me if you need additional information or just want to bounce some other things off of me.  Best of luck to you.  Jill",
