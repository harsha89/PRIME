      "Content": "Mar 29, 2009 11:13AM - edited Mar 29, 2009 11:17AM by webwriter Needy, I wish I could put you in touch with my husband. He was so like you in the beginning of this! He researched for endless hours and came up with so much information that it was utterly amazing. His support, his understanding, his absolute refusal to come unglued (Yet! he's promised a doozie when this is all over!) and remain my rock throughout this ordeal has brought us closer than ever before--and we've ALWAYS been close. I am sure I speak for all of us when I give you a heartfelt thanx for being the kind of husband that you are. You're on the right track and some great ladies will be along shortly to give you some advice about facilities in your area. In the meantime, try to take it one step at a time. This stage is the worst--learning, planning, getting your diagnosis (DX) and treatments lined up. The unknowns feel like they will kill you and the shock just overtakes everything for awhile. It's a natural part of this, so take it slow and wade through it a little at a time. You're doing it right and that bodes well for both of you on this journey. Let us know when you have biopsy results so that we can be more specific for you and for her particular set of circumstances. (Then surgery results.) The learning curve is huge, but once you know EXACTLY what kind/stage/grade/status of breast cancer you are dealing with the decisions will become more clear. My husband learned that the more research he did early on the more he frustrated himself--much of what he learned did not apply in the end and he had to start over, poor guy! We'll be here, every step of the way. You are not alone and neither is your wife. This site is a treasure trove of caring help, good solid information, and understanding no matter where you are in the process. You've made an important first step-- you've come to the right place. I wish you both well through the journey to come. You'll make it--one foot in front of the other. P.S. Be sure to let her cry and be enraged when those turns come. You can't stop it for either of you, so get it out and let it cleanse. Try to take turns if you can. It works better that way. ;) There will be time to \"fix\" things later--for now, just be.",

I'm sure your doc has already told you, but the prognosis for your tumor size, stage, grade, node status and hormone receptors is the best it could possibly be.  Your re-grading is something to be aware of and consider during treatment, but it isn't something to panic over.  As was mentioned above, the Grade is all about how mean and aggressive this sucker is. So, they discovered that yours is a little nastier than first thought. But you still got it before it spread and you can still go at it from the hormone angle, which is awesome. I was pretty happy with my Grade 2, haha! Being re-graded to 3 explained a few things for me, but honestly, even that didn't change my prognosis much.  I hope you can get the Oncotype testing. Either way tho, your Onco will probably take you to Adjuvant!Online which will give you a great little graph showing what differing treatments can do for your odds...including no further treatment at all. If he doesn't, be sure to request it. It was really good for my peace of mind--knowing that I'm doing the right thing. I'm glad you're up and around! I've been thinking about you TONS!",

My wedding ring got tight so I took it off, along with my watch. Then a tightness started under my arm--where I had full ROM before.

But because of it, I will employ every tool in the arsenal to fight and to win. I'm battling cancer here--not going to bed for three days of antibiotics. This is not an issue of my body being unhealthy. Cancer is not a part of me and never will be.  I will rally my body and teach it to fight back. Will I win? No one knows yet. But I'm not sick.

And yup, I got the idea at  http://stepup-speakout.org after following a link (actually several!) from this forum. Also found out there that my glove doesn't fit right. It doesn't cover my knuckles and it gaps around my thumb and fingers. In fact, I'm none too sure about this sleeve either, but it's not as bad as the glove. It would appear that the \"ready made\" products weren't \"ready made\" for me. Will get a hold of insurance and see what they cover.

Mine was slightly wonky from SNB, much more so from ALND, which is why I asked which you had. Not weird at all, haha! You're right. EVERYTHING is weird once you start this process! My guess is your arm slosh is due to your node surgery, not the lump that was removed. I could be wrong about that, but if your boob isn't sloshy it would make sense. Sort of. As much as anything does right now, haha! Can you sleep with your arm elevated? Maybe that will help it drain a bit. I SO get what you mean about the chafing sensation. I keep thinking there's a seam in my shirt/tank/bra that is rubbing it. Odd when it turns out nothing is even TOUCHING it! AAAAARRRRRRGGGHHHH!!!!! Happy New Year, Lady. And cheers! I'm having as much champagne as I want tonite! ",

As each new bald pate arrives, I get a little thrill from seeing the freedom and smiles you are expressing. Thank you so much! I made it official this week. It was finally warm enough for me to have a good \"excuse\" not to wear a hat. Reactions were fantastic all around. I went to the drug store (of course!), to my Onco, to my daughter's school, grocery shopping... up until now I've tossed a hat into the car in case I felt uncomfortable. I didn't even bother this week. It's too hot for a hat and the wind and the sunshine on my scalp feel AMAZING! I do, however, think that at times a little LESS enthusiasm and support would be nice. I was on a time table and running late when I stopped by my local C-store for some extra water. FIVE people stopped me to tell me their stories and give me a morale boost. Wonderful of them, but I was very, very late! Sometimes a little anonymity might be a good thing. Too bad it would take a wig. I never even bothered to try one on!",

My anesthesiologist for my first surgery (unrelated to bc) told me that if I smoked within 24 hours of surgery I could drop dead on the spot. The one for the bc surgeries said that was bunk but did tell me to wait as long as possible b/c my respiratory system would be slow to compensate.  I waited four hours or so and found he was right.

Now I'm okay, in a way, even looking forward to it. I called my friend/hairdresser and set up weekly appointments with her. Just had cut #2 yesterday and I LOVE it! I've had incredibly long hair most of my life--these shorter do's are so much fun to play with. We're having a blast. The last one, two weeks from now will be a great little pixie we picked out. After that, pre-emptive shave. So far, my husband has been utterly shocked at his own reaction. Turns out he just \"thought\" he loved long hair. Men! ha!  I've started a baseball cap collection with family and friends who want to help and just don't know how. I have required that each cap sent have the name of the person that sent it and the date inscribed on the inside of the bill in permanent marker. Each cap should mean something special to the donor. My dad, for example, is sending me a 101 Airborne from Vietnam. My SMom, a Red Sparkly (ewww, but it's her thing) from the Red Hat Society. Each time I wear them, I will be able to look up and know a certain individual was thinking of me and can return the thoughts on that day. When it's over, I'll have a killer collection to remind me how much I am loved. I pretty much knew from go that I wasn't a wig person--tho DH is choosing a few for his own perverted entertainment purposes. I'll enjoy that, but doubt one ever makes it into public view.  Ballcaps or bare, oh yes, I dare! I too will Embrace the Bald!  Soon! Hat's off to you, Ladies!",

Just seems like a waste of a perfectly good head of hair. Mine will grow back--he has no such guarantee! I will shave mine when the time comes. I may take a page from the Road To Hell thread and make it a party with friends and fun. I may do it with my little girl and my hubster. It may be hubster, me, a box of kleenex and a bottle of Valium. I don't know yet. But from everything I read, it's a major annoyance once it starts coming out. I'm  going to go with it and not fight it. I just had my hair cut for my rt. shoulder repair, knowing it would be hard to handle after that. It's shoulder length for the first time in over 30 years. After the holiday, I will be making weekly appointments with my hairdresser, who is also a friend. I will let her \"play\" in it in ways she's always wanted to, and experiement with the \"growing out\" styles available to me--but every week, I will go in for a new and shorter hairstyle-- until D day. It's not because I want to prolong having hair though. It's because I have felt so out of control since this whole thing started (not good for a control freak like me!) that I have to do SOMETHING my way. I also want to get used to not having much. I also truly want to see what some of my options are while it grows out. But the bottom line for me is, I want to do it on my terms. My way. It's not much, but to me, it's a definitive way I can fight back--and I'll take all I can get right now. While a couple of friends have promised a luncheon wig shopping trip, I don't think I'm going to go that route very often. I have notified everyone who ever cared about me that I'm starting a baseball hat collection--and I want the bills pre-bent, haha! Fighting New Year, everyone. 2009 is the year we get our lives back.

It always seems too hurried, but that may be because I think you're someone I could enjoy a very long cup of coffee with sometime. I certainly cannot fault your in depth analysis, opinions and clarity of options. Even when you think I'm being totally obtuse, you allow me to clarify and that really matters-even if I just clarify myself into confirming that I'm an idiot. ;)  I also wish for you a monthly updated \"newsletter\" feed from this thread. Not because I think you have much to learn from it, though we both know there is always room, but because your on-call docs could have their eyes opened in a big way. Wouldn't hurt them. Trust me. Besides, I think you would enjoy and appreciate the words in these pages. In fact, I think you would push to make letters like these required reading for the entire staff.  I even think you might make their lessons a regular discussion on standard of care. I wish the rest of your practice could even touch your standard.",

      "Content": "Mar 24, 2009 10:39PM - edited Mar 25, 2009 03:33PM by webwriter Dear GYN #1: I wish you would seriously consider giving up your GYN practice and go strictly to OB, which appears to be your forte. You were wonderful with the pregnancy and birth and I'll never forget the care you took with me during that time. However, when you realized there wouldn't be any more children and that I was having serious problems, the loss of interest was palpable. The anti-depressants weren't what I was after. I begged you for three years to help me out with my hormones. Um, that birth control pill thing? Not a good idea. And considering you missed the lump 3 months before my DX, I'm thinkin' you should stick to swollen bellies and give up the boobs. Dear GYN#2: I wish you had been on top of my case with your staff. Promising me three proceedures in two days seemed like a lot. I knew that when I asked it. That's WHY I called so many times. That's WHY when conflicting information came down I was on it within minutes. Your screw up cost me valuable months between mammo and biopsy. I too might have gotten away without chemo. Oh, and that \"doesn't matter, we're taking it out anyway thing?:\" That's not a great answer when someone wants to know WHY they are having so much trouble. Turns out it did matter. It's all still \"in\" because I have this OTHER pesky problem to work out. Speaking of that \"other problem,\" just so you know, it WAS a good idea for me to stop taking that birth control #1 gave me. You see, I had this lump. Remember that mammogram you got from his office? The one that caused you to send me to surgeon #1? Dear Surgeon#1: I wish you had looked me in the eye and told me the truth: that you were not interested in me, my case, or any of my questions. When my husband put his foot in the door because I was still speaking to you, he didn't REALLY think you'd go ahead and walk out of it. It would have been nice to know, upfront, that you weren't really up on the latest in this particular field. When I requested mammosite prep during surgery you should've told me then that I needed a new surgeon. You too cost me valuable weeks when I belonged at a bigger and more specialized facility-- and you knew it from my line of questioning. Or you would have, if you'd stuck around long enough to listen. To all my fired doctors: I wish for you to come upon patients every day that have become as educated (mostly through this site!) and pro-active as I have. I wish for you to no longer take it for granted that you are as empowered as god in making decisions over my life. I wish for you... a reality check, just like the one you gave me. Dear Surgeon's #2 and #3: Thank you for taking so much time with me, for cleaning up the messes your predecessors left and for helping me choose the right path for me as an individual. Thank you especially #2 for having grace when delivering bad news, doing such a FINE job on my boob and sending me to Onco #1. You were right. We're a GREAT match. Dear Onco: You're a nut case. I love you. But seriously, quit feeling Scotty's Masterpiece Scar and listen to me about this Neulasta thing, okay? You admitted I was right about the rest of it, now get serious and admit I'm right about this too. Have more than a glance at the bloodwork. I crashed bad you know. I don't want that again. Got it? Or should I bring you more studies and print outs? See you tomorrow! Oh, and get Nursie ready. She says she has to sleep a bit longer before my days for some reason. Might I be running her out of sarcasm and angst? BwAHAHAHA! ;)  (Updated: Dear Onco: Thank you for not making me give you the above note. Thank you for the extra meds, for not making me feel like a whiner and being as concerned as me about what the on-call did last week, and for being proactive about the rest of my treatments. I knew I loved you for a reason! Oh, and good job with Nursie. She was TOTALLY on her game today!)  ",

      "Content": "Jan 2, 2009 09:25PM - edited Jan 2, 2009 11:03PM by webwriter I had a 1.4cm at 12:00, kind of high, in my large C cup, 12/15/08--so not quite 3 weeks out now. While I no longer carry a perfect or matched set, the cosmetic results are very, very good. In the longest dimension, 7cm were removed. Don't ask me how he got that out of there without a big hole, but he did. (Actually, he used a \"tunnel\" to get it out, but that might be TMI, haha!) My scar is about 4cm long, and curves with the shape of my breast. Honest, I look just fine. (Don't take that from me tho--take it from the family expert, my Husband!) In fact, if it weren't for the SNB and ALND I had, I'm betting I'd still have a near perfect match. The scar has begun to come down and my PT recommended that I massage it. (With specific instructions for how) It has helped tremendously.  Like you, I was really, really nervous about the outcome-- I had seen some photos on the web that didn't help me much either. But then I realized they were on a PS site. DUH! **headsmack** of course a plastic surgeon isn't going to advertise his skills on a case like mine! And don't panic at the early results either. There will be some swelling and such. It will come down. The scar won't stay a big ridge. (Mine is already almost even with the skin) The discoloration on it will fade too. My only disappointment has been some nipple inversion. My left is now actually, \"perkier\" than my right too. Go figure. Please don't be afraid. You will be quite happily surprised with the results. I sure was. In fact, when all this is over for me, I may have the right lifted to match!",
