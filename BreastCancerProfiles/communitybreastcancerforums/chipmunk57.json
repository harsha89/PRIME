He told me he would mix me a 3 drug cocktail and it worked! Unlike the last time I had surgery and threw up for 3 days. A little concerned about my pre-surgery MRI. The left side was clear but they found an additional small spot in the right breast which the radiologist said could be a satellite tumor or a positive lymph node. I had a MX planned anyway so that didn't change anything. Also, one lymph node in the armpit showed a little activity. If more nodes turn up positive from the SNB I may need an axillary node dissection. So now I am waiting on the path report, just when I thought all the waiting for bad news was over. Oh well, fingers crossed. Hope all is going well for everyone else this week!",

My story is very similar to yours: noticed a \"dent\" under my right nipple when I pulled off my sports bra but couldn't feel a lump. This was on Oct 3rd. Saw my family doc the next day, she said she felt \"something\" but it wasn't well-defined. She set up a diagnostic mammogram for Oct 18. At the hospital, they sent me directly from the mammo to ultrasound. When the radiologist was doing the U/S she said she felt a \"smoothness\" under the dent and wanted to do a biopsy. Biopsied on Oct 22nd (hurt like hell!) and my family doctor called me in on Monday to tell me I have breast cancer. Yesterday my husband & I went to see my breast surgeon. I will be having a simple mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy, probably in about two weeks. My tumor is fairly large and my breasts are small, so it didn't make sense to have a partial, she would have to remove 90% of my breast anyway to get good margins. Anyway, just wanted to say best of luck to you, and we will get through this!",

Most of the time I manage to be pretty upbeat and positive, but last night all of a sudden I just got scared about everything - surgery, chemo, dying, ... I had a good cry and hugs from hubby. Today I am back at work and pretty much under control again, but I just got a call telling me my MRI is scheduled for next Wednesday, the 13th (hope that's not an omen!). It's starting to get real now, and I might have to get off the banks of that river in Egypt soon. Take care.",

The pain you feel when moving, etc, is mainly from the stitches pulling your skin. They clip the stitches and pull the drains. It hardly hurt at all. It feels kind of weird because you can feel the drains coming out, but I felt 100%better afterwards. I'm really bummed that I have to get another drain when I have my node dissection next week, but my surgeon said it will probably only be in for 48 hours. Hope so!",
