As someone who just lost her wife on 4/28/17, I have no words of wisdom but rather words of experience. I understand all too well how our lives become so much about cancer, especially when we are the caretaker. Try, as best you can, to not focus on the cancer, but rather on your wife's life and the life you two made together. Cherish each moment, talk with her when she is coherent and hold her hand when she cannot speak. Tell her how much you love her every chance you can, even when she is sleeping. Sit quietly when she is sleeping and reflect on the beautiful memories you have together. Hold her as long as you want to and kiss her to let her know that you are there.
