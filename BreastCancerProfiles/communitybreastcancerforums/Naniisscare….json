My first chemo session is in one hour and I wanted to feel not so alone so I read everyone's posts. I am scared but because of my family support they will ensure that I can't hightail it ðŸ˜„ I already have severe anxiety attacks due to being attacked at work 5 years ago and I suffer from PTSD as well as copd. But I'm determined to get through this and I will be doing my best. And yes I'm a list and organising freak lol ðŸ˜‚ My thoughts are with you all as we travel this journey together.",

It's strange I was so scared but reading all the positive comments and advice on here has really helped me. I am having it it through iv every three weeks. Hopefully this feeling of strength will stay with me when I have to go for my first treatment. My best wishes to you all. Merry Christmas and happy new year.",

My family's say I have enough items for ten years but it helps with the nerves. Love the shopping lists on this site. So helpful My daughter brought me a back pack with all the items I would need if my temp gets too high and I have to go to hospital as I also suffer from copd. Please let me know how your treatments go. I am having 6 months of chemo every 3 weeks at this stage. I'll be thinking of you and every one else who is on this roller coaster.",
