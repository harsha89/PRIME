My left breast had a 4cm lump with black discharge from BOTH nipples. I am 40 yrs old (39 at the time) but the lump turned out to be scar tissue. They did a biopsy and it was benign then they did a nipple duct excision on both breast. I feel fine now but she is going to check me in April to make sure that all is still good. Keep your chin up, I know how you feel,I wish you ALL THE LUCK !!!!!!!",
